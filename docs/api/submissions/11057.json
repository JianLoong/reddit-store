{"id": 11057, "submission_id": "11dbwzg", "title": "AITA for telling my family why I didn't invite them to my wedding?", "selftext": "I (F25) have been married to my wife (NB30) for a little over a year. We've been together for 5 years, got engaged in 2021 and married in 2022 (January winter wedding, was gorgeous and small with only close friends, my maternal grandparents and my wife's mom) I am the first grandchild/cousin to get married on both sides of the family.\n\nI'm very feminine and my wife is more masculine, but both of us are very much queer and in love. My wife is very open about being intersex. Her voice is deeper and she has surplus testosterone, but she identifies with she/they pronouns and rejects male identification on any grounds. She has told me that even if they were cis, they would still dress and alter their appearance to be more masc.\n\nAfter my extended family met my wife for the first time they extensively called them \"he.\" (we understand people make mistakes but this was deliberate) It hurt my wife deeply, so I stopped bringing her around and only interacted with my family when necessary. My maternal grandparents were the exception and love her very much, my grandpa and them have the same sense of humour and I love watching them interact. The rejection of my wife's identity is what caused me not to invite any other family members to my wedding.\n\nLast month my wife posted pictures of our wedding to Instagram and posted about how our anniversary is special, telling me how much she loves me and is looking forward to many more anniversaries in the future. My younger sister, who I didn't know followed me, saw them and showed my parents and extended family, who subsequently blew up my phone for weeks about not inviting them to my milestone and how my \"husband\" must have brainwashed me.\n\nI told them that this attitude was why I didn't invite them because their presence made my partner uncomfortable. I thought it was cut and dry and over with. But my wife removed the post anyway due to some nasty comments.\n\nSo I wrote this email and mass-sent it to all of my relatives:\n\nTo all of whom did not attend my wedding,\n\nYour refusal to accept my wife as she is, was what prevented you all from receiving an invitation. (grandma) and (grandpa) attended because they were able to recognize my wife for who she is and love her for her. If you did not receive an invitation, it was because you have either: a.) insulted my wife by calling her pronouns she does not identify with on purpose, b.) calling my wife my \"friend\" instead of my girlfriend or partner when we were dating. or c.) have expressed homophobic views in the past. Please do not call her names or drag us online when it is your behaviour that got you in this mess.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOP\n\nMy entire family is calling me an asshole. My wife is saying she could have toughed it out for one day, and my entire family is angry that I didn't invite them. I just feel horrible about cutting them out of such an important milestone in the family and I feel like I did something wrong.
