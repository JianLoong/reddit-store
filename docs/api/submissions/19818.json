They are a really great group of people, and I have always felt very welcomed when I'm with them. My wife and I live relatively close to most of her family, so I do see them quite regularly.\n\nFor the past few years, my BIL (M33) and his wife (F31) have been fostering dogs. Most of the dogs have been great, but they typically don't keep them for more than a few weeks before finding a permanent home for the dog. However, that all changed with Lucky.\n\nLucky is a 150 lbs pitbull with a history of, as the shelter put it, \"sporadic acts of aggression.\" Not only that, this dog has unfortunately been subjected to steroid injections by its previous owners. Since no one in their right mind would want to take Lucky, my BIL and his wife decided to keep him full-time as he would most likely be put down otherwise.\n\nI saw this dog once before, and I was more than a little terrified. Lucky doesn't take kindly to strangers, and my BIL has told me that he had to put him into a chain-linked enclosure in the backyard whenever anyone comes to visit them.\n\nSince then, Lucky has chewed through this enclosure, and my BIL and his wife have decided that perhaps exposure therapy to strangers is the best treatment for him. So, they've been asking people to come by their house to say hi.\n\nMy wife has volunteered both of us, and when she told me that, I let her know that she'd be going alone. We argued about it for a while, and my wife told me that I was doing the most. She said it would be rude if I didn't go since she had already promised them, but I still adamantly refused.\n\nShe then framed it as how a real man would come and make sure she felt safe and would protect her if needed. I was beyond annoyed at this point and told her that hypothetically, I could find a new wife, but I couldn't get an arm back. She got upset by this and decided to leave on her own. AITA?\n\nEdit - For those wondering, my BIL and SIL do have some training with dog rehabilitation. But Lucky is the most challenging case ever seen by them or the shelter which he lived in.\n\nUPDATE - My wife has left to go visit her brother and SIL, I stayed behind. I'm not going to lie, no amount of money would make me want to go next to Lucky. I spoke with my MIL and she too is terrified of the dog, she doesn't blame me at all for not going. To be honest, it was nice to bond over our shared fear of Lucky.", "created_utc": 1686924794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14axy7u/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_wifes_brother/", "score": 1452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They tend to go for the face or the throat, and not to let go once they locked jaws.\n\nAs OPs BIL and SIL have had training how to take care of those dogs I guess they know what they are doing. There are many different ways to expose a dog to new people, like train new experiences under anxiety blocking medication, slowly getting used to kind persons who bring a sausage each time and come a little bit closer each time till the dog learns to see people as friendly, and many more. \n\nBut sometimes it does not work out. In Germany, where no dog is put down in shelters no matter how long it takes to find them new homes, some of those dogs live forever in special shelters in groups of four or five dogs and enough space to run around.\n\nSo who knows how this one will turn out? Still it is up to OP and not to his wife to decide if he wants to help.", "Wait, they were the family dogs?!", "\"...she tried to pull the dogs off her 5-month-old son Hollace Dean and 2-year-old daughter Lilly Jane, who were killed in the attack...\"\n\n\"The Oct. 5 attack lasted 10 minutes.\"\n\nMy God.", "Those poor babies... \n\nI know some owners are fanatical about them but I just could not have a breed with that sort of history of aggression around my kids", "An 90 lb pit bull is a huge dog. 150? Makes me wonder if this is actually real. They're generally 40-75 lbs.\n\nEdit: After a quick Google I found one at 180 lbs. That's a huge dog but he seems friendly. Adding steroids? Not a safe situation.", "https://www.pawlicy.com/blog/pitbull-growth-and-weight-chart/#pit-bull-growth-weight\n\nThis is an average weight. That dog is massive. \n\nhttps://www.pawlicy.com/blog/newfoundland-growth-and-weight-chart/\n\nThat's a newfoundland dog.", "Yep. He either needs intensive training or sending away to the rainbow bridge. \n\nI'm glad there are a few of us here who can genuinely appreciate just how dangerous this Lucky is.", "She is putting herself in danger. You can't protect her from her own stupidity.", "Not if they're answer is exposure or just lock it away.\n\nHopefully they find a well established professional who can help the dog.", "It as how a real man would come and make sure she felt safe and would protect her if needed,NAT", "Seriously. Their neighbors didn't sign up to help rehabilitate this dog.", "I'm only theorizing here since I can't know the dogs' motives, but there are a few possible reasons the dogs turned out that aggressive despite being long-term family dogs (none are an excuse it is so heartbreaking for the family):\n\n-based on the age of the dogs, the dogs could have been sick from old age and possible early dementia that made them lose control and forget who they were attacking (almost happened with out dalmatian who almost bit my mom, the dog was old and sick, but held herself back). \n\n- someone in the family or friends was training the dogs to be fighters (it's shocking how many times stories like this come up, and later you find out they were trying the dogs to be aggressive or abusing them) \n\n- The kids were constantly bugging and hurting the dogs with no supervision because the kids don't know better. I know people who had their dogs bite their kids because of this.", "It had steroid injections, which will only increase its aggression, plus it must be a solid mass of muscle.", "That's not actually a pit bull, it's a mastiff crossed with some kind of bully dog. And bulked up with steroids and treated God knows how. May have been deliberately de-socialized because a lot of fools like a mean dog.\n\nThis isn't the same as fostering a normal dog or even an abused pittie. Danger, danger, danger."]}
