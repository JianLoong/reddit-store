They are a really great group of people, and I have always felt very welcomed when I'm with them. My wife and I live relatively close to most of her family, so I do see them quite regularly.\n\nFor the past few years, my BIL (M33) and his wife (F31) have been fostering dogs. Most of the dogs have been great, but they typically don't keep them for more than a few weeks before finding a permanent home for the dog. However, that all changed with Lucky.\n\nLucky is a 150 lbs pitbull with a history of, as the shelter put it, \"sporadic acts of aggression.\" Not only that, this dog has unfortunately been subjected to steroid injections by its previous owners. Since no one in their right mind would want to take Lucky, my BIL and his wife decided to keep him full-time as he would most likely be put down otherwise.\n\nI saw this dog once before, and I was more than a little terrified. Lucky doesn't take kindly to strangers, and my BIL has told me that he had to put him into a chain-linked enclosure in the backyard whenever anyone comes to visit them.\n\nSince then, Lucky has chewed through this enclosure, and my BIL and his wife have decided that perhaps exposure therapy to strangers is the best treatment for him. So, they've been asking people to come by their house to say hi.\n\nMy wife has volunteered both of us, and when she told me that, I let her know that she'd be going alone. We argued about it for a while, and my wife told me that I was doing the most. She said it would be rude if I didn't go since she had already promised them, but I still adamantly refused.\n\nShe then framed it as how a real man would come and make sure she felt safe and would protect her if needed. I was beyond annoyed at this point and told her that hypothetically, I could find a new wife, but I couldn't get an arm back. She got upset by this and decided to leave on her own. AITA?\n\nEdit - For those wondering, my BIL and SIL do have some training with dog rehabilitation. But Lucky is the most challenging case ever seen by them or the shelter which he lived in.", "created_utc": 1686924794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14axy7u/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_wifes_brother/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
