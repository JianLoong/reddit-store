We also help her out financially at times.\n\nBack when Mary and I met she made it clear that she dislikes me, which I don't blame her for, as I was in a dark place mentally. I also dropped out of high school and had a kid when I was 16.\n\nSince then, I finished high school, got well-paying job, and started therapy. Katrina and I now have a very successful business together, a house, savings, emergency funds, etc. My son is thriving.\n\nMary always had more of an issue with how I look. I'm a skinny boi, never been in a gym in my life, very emo, lots of tattoos, I wear makeup, paint my nails, and I will sometimes wear clothing from the women's section.\n\nShe's made a few comments to me directly about this, and a few to Katrina, but overall she just gives me dirty looks when she sees me (which is about once or twice a year. I tried to connect with her years ago, but since she acted so judgemental and ignored my attempts, I accepted it.\n\nI've never been disrespectful towards her. Katrina stands up to her mother readily, and she has always put her in her place, to the point where it's under control.\n\nWe recently celebrated our anniversary and the fact that I am doing better mentally (I still suffer from an ED, depression and PTSD, as a result of childhood trauma).\n\nOur goal was always to get married in 2024, and since both Katrina and I consider ourselves ready (and my therapist also thinks it's a good time) I proposed.\n\nKatrina has a lot of trauma herself. She's very much against many traditions - like asking for a parent's permission. We discussed it before and we have always been on the same page about the fact that she didn't want me to ask her mom before proposing.\n\nA while ago, Katrina told Mary that we got engaged, and immediately she reached out to me via a text, in which she said that I am being very disrespectful towards both her and Katrina's background and culture (I am American, she's not)\n\nI spoke to a few friends who are from Katrina's culture, and they agree that I am being disrespectful.\n\nI feel that Katrina's desires and needs should come first, but I also wonder whether I'm not being disrespectful towards her background.\n\nTL;DR: My fianc\u00e9e Katrina (23F) and I (24M) have been together for 7 years. Katrina's mom, Mary, dislikes me because of my appearance and has made comments about it. We do have a successful life together.

Katrina's desires are more important than her judgemental mom.", "You and Katrina agreed on what traditions you want in your marriage, It's rather disrespectful these other people criticize the decision you and your fiance made.\n\nAnd if we're being utterly traditional you're supposed to ask the father not the mother anyways.\n\nThese other people need to keep their opinion to themselves, they're not the ones with the ring so they don't need to worry about it. Always put your wife first, seems like you're already on the right track NTA", "Based on what information we have (which is quite a bit), I\u2019d say NTA. Your to-be-mother-in-law has made it clear she does not like you, and she probably never will sadly. You obviously asked Katrina if she wanted to follow that cultural tradition, and she said no. Also, you 2 are practically married bar from the signed papers; you\u2019re already living like a married couple. Her mom is upset because she wanted to say no to giving you her blessing. She was never going to say yes. \n\nYou did the right thing in not asking, especially since Katrina didn\u2019t want you to from the beginning.", "NTA and you have already proposed and are engaged to Katrina.\n\nThankfully, the two of you are financially independent and in agreement about this.\n\n\nHave you talked about this with y\u2019all\u2019s therapist and if so what is the therapist\u2019s opinion?\n\nIt seems like apologizing to your future MIL for not asking her first for her permission or retroactively asking for her permission would be feeding the beast and an unhealthy move. In general. I recognize I have no knowledge of the culture, but Katrina does and she\u2019s okay with it.\n\n\nHopefully your future MIL doesn\u2019t try to cause some drama at the rehearsal dinner or the wedding or engagement party if you\u2019re planning to have any of those or thinking you\u2019ll feel pressured to invite her.\n\nTry not to give that woman any power over your and Katrina\u2019s happiness if at all possible. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s easier said than done, but therapy can be really helpful for helping to keep you focused on what\u2019s important while building skills for tuning out if not off the noise.", "NTA.\n\n>she said that I am being very disrespectful towards both her and Katrina's background and culture\n\nShe just wanted to make it all about her, probably by saying no. Katrina is presumably from the same culture as her mother and it didn't bother her.", "Of course NTA. The only opinion that matters here is Katrina's.", "NTA. You're fiancee does not feel disrespected by what you did. And your FMIL did not earn your respect so it's really on her if she feels disrespected.

For another, Katrina is not her mother's property and as such no one needs her permission.\n\nIt might be different if Katrina wanted to follow this tradition, but she doesn't. That's the clincher.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I'm betting Mary is mad because she'd planned to refuse permission.", "Your only obligation is to be respectful to your partner.

I said the beginning near the very begnining.\n\n> You will have noticed during the ceremony that I did not walk (daughter name) down the aisle and give her away. Nor has (Son in-law) ever asked for my permission to marry her. No outdated traditions were involved in their relationship. As it should be in 2023. They have simply chosen each other and that is all that matters.\n\nWell some folks in the room did not like this at all. They looked like they smelled a turd. I loved that reaction.
