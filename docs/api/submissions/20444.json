Dad could\u2019ve gone about it in a much nicer way, but he did give you the stuff you need to clean it yourself. That, in my opinion, is still an extremely generous gift. It\u2019s absolutely necessary that they sort out the health and safety hazards, obviously including the mould, but you are being dramatic about the car being dirty.", "Not sure if you\u2019re TA but I\u2019d get over it quick, clean the thing out, and drive.", "I wouldn't say you're being an asshole, but certainly you're being ungrateful. It's gross that it got to that state, but it's yours now, so I think it would maybe be a fun thing for you to take pride in your new vehicle, clean it up to your standards, maybe get it detailed, buy some seat covers and some little trinkets to really make the car your own and be happy that they are doing that for you in the first place. A car is a luxury gift, no matter the condition. I'd have been so happy to be in your shoes, even if I had to clean up a mess. When I got my first car, which I might add was when I was in my mid 20s because my mom refused to help me learn how to drive and I had to hire a driving instructor on my own, I got a beat up old Intrepid (which i bought myself), not the greatest condition but it ran well enough and didn't like, have a hole in the floor or anything. One day the car suddenly doesn't start and it turned out that my mom had cut some wires in the engine, and then tried to blame it on the neighbor. Didn't drive again for a few years, I just junked the car and went back to the bus... so yea, it could be a lot worse than just having to spend an hour cleaning the car.\n\nMy other thought, because I hear some parents can be like this, are they sneakily trying to teach you a lesson about responsibility by leaving you to clean it up and take care of what is now your property?  This is definitely an exercise in responsibility, and maturity also, even if it wasn't intended.\n\nNo, it may not have been a shiny new (to you) car, but just take it to a car wash and clean it out.

Maybe it will take more than hour to clean, but working a minimum wage job or just above minimum wage job to be able to afford to buy her own car would be a much more labor intensive situation, and likely in that situation, she'd also be having to deal with cleaning up other peoples messes, and taking care of other peoples crap. \n\nYea, I think the parents are jerks for not cleaning it before hand, but it's not a huge deal. At the end of the day, she still gets a car when she didn't have one before. As for picking up some of the responsibility for her siblings, that seems pretty typical when an oldest sibling gets their license and a car. It's not necessarily fair or cool, and its often a burden on a young person who is trying to establish their own lives, but the parents aren't committing some sort of sin here.

I don't even know what her end goal is in refusing to clean it. Like, it's not going to solve anything. As I said, OPs not being an asshole, the parents are being pretty lame, but she is throwing a fit about being given a functioning, free vehicle but its dirty and the interior isn't good enough, so she's going to, what? Not clean it, and by extension not accept the car as a gift? It doesn't make much sense. Like, what is the refusal to take responsibility, *for what is now her car,* going to do?
