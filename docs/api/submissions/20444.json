Humiliating to get such a present and humiliating that they actually thought this was a good idea to humiliate you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you went with your dad to a used car lot and saw a good deal on a car that all you needed to do is clean it - it wouldn't have been a problem, right?  So, if having a car is more important than the sick sense of humor your parents have, suck it up, clean it and keep it as clean as you like from that point on.", "ESH\n\nI feel like they could have at least cleaned it themselves or paid for someone to do it before they gifted it to you. Especially since you said you would be helping out driving your siblings to school, that would have been fair.\n\nBut honestly, you have a car! It drives and works, I would just either clean it, or dip into any savings you have a get someone professional to give it a work over. \n\nYou have a CAR and a free one at that! The other scenario is, you have nothing to drive!

So many kids my age got a car with an engine that ran and could get to point A to point B,  it was a car and freedom.

It\u2019s sweet of you to want to help your rents out by driving your siblings to and from school, and it\u2019s sweet of them to gift you a car. A car is such a massive present, and if it were just dirty, I\u2019d say that you were being a brat.\n\nThe fact that parts of the car are actually broken is unacceptable. Is it roadworthy? Has it recently seen a mechanic? They\u2019re putting all of their kids in a death trap if there\u2019s anything majorly wrong, and that should be your angle.\n\nAside from any mechanical problems, and obvious hazards like the chair falling to pieces, I\u2019d accept the dirty car. Dad could\u2019ve gone about it in a much nicer way, but he did give you the stuff you need to clean it yourself. That, in my opinion, is still an extremely generous gift. It\u2019s absolutely necessary that they sort out the health and safety hazards, obviously including the mould, but you are being dramatic about the car being dirty.", "Not sure if you\u2019re TA but I\u2019d get over it quick, clean the thing out, and drive.", "I wouldn't say you're being an asshole, but certainly you're being ungrateful. It's gross that it got to that state, but it's yours now, so I think it would maybe be a fun thing for you to take pride in your new vehicle, clean it up to your standards, maybe get it detailed, buy some seat covers and some little trinkets to really make the car your own and be happy that they are doing that for you in the first place. A car is a luxury gift, no matter the condition. I'd have been so happy to be in your shoes, even if I had to clean up a mess. When I got my first car, which I might add was when I was in my mid 20s because my mom refused to help me learn how to drive and I had to hire a driving instructor on my own, I got a beat up old Intrepid (which i bought myself), not the greatest condition but it ran well enough and didn't like, have a hole in the floor or anything. One day the car suddenly doesn't start and it turned out that my mom had cut some wires in the engine, and then tried to blame it on the neighbor. Didn't drive again for a few years, I just junked the car and went back to the bus... so yea, it could be a lot worse than just having to spend an hour cleaning the car.\n\nMy other thought, because I hear some parents can be like this, are they sneakily trying to teach you a lesson about responsibility by leaving you to clean it up and take care of what is now your property?  This is definitely an exercise in responsibility, and maturity also, even if it wasn't intended.\n\nNo, it may not have been a shiny new (to you) car, but just take it to a car wash and clean it out. Save up and get it detailed, even. Its not that big of a deal. Nice, not really. Something to get all up in arms over? nahh.", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey don't have to give you a car at all and cleaning it really shouldn't take too long.
