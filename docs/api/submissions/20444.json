Humiliating to get such a present and humiliating that they actually thought this was a good idea to humiliate you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you went with your dad to a used car lot and saw a good deal on a car that all you needed to do is clean it - it wouldn't have been a problem, right?  So, if having a car is more important than the sick sense of humor your parents have, suck it up, clean it and keep it as clean as you like from that point on.", "ESH\n\nI feel like they could have at least cleaned it themselves or paid for someone to do it before they gifted it to you. Especially since you said you would be helping out driving your siblings to school, that would have been fair.\n\nBut honestly, you have a car! It drives and works, I would just either clean it, or dip into any savings you have a get someone professional to give it a work over. \n\nYou have a CAR and a free one at that! The other scenario is, you have nothing to drive! I know you're upset, but if it was me I would just get it cleaned up and you have your freedom with a car that drives!", "yta, that's pretty reasonable kid, clean it up and keep it nice, you got wheels, making em shine is on you", "YTA. You know how many grateful children would walk through glass for a car any car and you can\u2019t clean one ?

Repairing a car can take months or years. \n\n\nYou should be happy you get a car and you should take pride and ownership in having a clean car.
