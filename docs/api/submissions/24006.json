If you can afford it, Sarah could contribute more to her retirement rather than current expenses. \n\nI never thought I would stay home with kids for as long as I did but that\u2019s what worked for our family. During those years my husbands 401k grew significantly while we didn\u2019t bother contributing towards mine.

Not all vocations earn the same revenue, so financial contributions can be pro-rated - or, if agreeable to both parties, one can provide more labor once kids come along based on earning potential and inclination to be home with kids full-time.  Or schedules can be shifted to avoid one parent having to quit their paycheck-earning vocation.  Whatever works for that couple.

She sounds ridiculous and a headache", "NTA and it doesn\u2019t sound like you said anything about her except if she chose to read into and expand on your comment. You expressed that you wanted something different than what she described for a relationship. And that was only after she rudely commented about your marriage. I think you were fine. Here\u2019s the thing - I have my own opinions about finances and marriage and I\u2019m guessing they don\u2019t match a fair number of my friends\u2019 current set up.

Are there specific plans on the amount she needs to pay so she can be added to the lease?", "NTA. Whatever the circumstances, they are between you and your wife.

If your wife is happy with the situation then that\u2019s fine. The fact that you\u2019re making her pay rent is strange. Determine the percentage she has paid and what\u2019s left to be paid and put her on the mortgage, and the deed at that percentage rate (eg 60% - 40%).\n\nCouldn\u2019t be me.

Honestly this is bizarre to me because she\u2019s essentially saying women need a man to take care of them. No we don\u2019t. I need a loving and supportive partner. I make my own money. I have bought my own house. I am not looking for someone to financially support me\u2026 children need adults to support them.

Once we were married I added her to the deed. \n\nWhen we sold that house and bought our next one, we bought it together.", "Exactly.  \n\nOne person doesnt outrank the other.  And one person isnt solely financially responsible for both, despite the 2nd person having income.

Their men were too busy trying to both fight a war AND support their mooching, lazy asses, while Yankee men could fight unfettered because their women made their own money. ;)\n\nBut seriously - any couple's financial arrangements is nobody's business but their own. What works for one couple may not work for another, and that's perfectly okay.", "hahaha You are not going to win with a southern belle. Tell her to *bless her little heart* the next time she pi$$es you off. It's the southern belle equivalent of \"aren't you an a$$hat\". \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a weird mentality. Each partner should contribute what they can to a relationship. That can be money, taking care of the household and children, or a combination of both. That\u2018s a partnership. And as women, we should be happy to be partners because partners create a life and take decisions together. I\u2018m sure Kate doesn\u2018t want to go back to the time when women weren\u2018t considered equals to men, got no say, were not allowed to work without their husbands\u2018 permission. Well, you can\u2018t have it all.", "NTA. \n\nYou have different outlooks on life. My issue with some modern traditionalist (both earn = modern, but only the man pays = traditional) is that they try to force their opinion down everyones throat, kinda like the red pill movement or basically anyone that\u2019s semi fanatical about something. \n\nIt\u2019s okay that she wants a partner that pays for everything, as long as they\u2019re in agreement, it\u2019s also okay that certain couples pay 50/50, or whatever they end up agreeing on. Peeps need to mind their business.", "NTA. Trust me, not *all* Southern women feel that way nor felt that way 50 years ago even. More power to your friend if he wanted a trophy wife \u2018cause that\u2019s what he got.", "Info:  \nYou say you want a partner, but you only mention finances. Are you doing half of cooking, cleaning, laundry, scheduling appointments, grocery shopping, meal planning, childcare(if you have kids), etc?", "It sucks for your wife to not be your equal financially or an equal in your home, I'm sure.\n\nBut with that said, NTA. She commented on your situation first. So it's OK for her to insult you and now have you insult her back? People who dish it out but can't take it are TA", "NTA,  I(F) also bought my house in my 20\u2019s and had roommates.  At some point I lived alone in the house then I meet my now fianc\u00e9.  When he moved in he started giving me $ for rent because everyone has to pay to live somewhere.   Shortly after that we made a joint account that we each put an agreed upon amount into each month.  That $ goes to paying all our joint expenses,  the mortgage, utilities, internet.  According to her since my Fiance moved into my house I should have to pay for everything apparently.  Or does she feel that way because of gender \u201cnorms\u201d.", "NTA. I think your comment was tempered. I still remember from about 7 years ago when someone made a comment to me when we were all in a car and he ran into the gas station to grab snacks and I said I would Venmo him. When he got out of the car and ran over the driver was like - you pay him for stuff? You\u2019re married, why? And he was shocked when I said we don\u2019t always do that but we have separate bank accounts and tend to just Venmo or quickpay each other for smaller items. It\u2019s totally fine to expect your partner to pay for half of what you\u2019re spending jointly or to pay for items when they\u2019re doing you a favor.", "You are happy so...thats not a problem. Aldo i would charge my husband rent if the house was mine. I would rather him safe his money. I wouldnt feel confortable to make money frm my husband. But if it works for you and your wife....", "If the social contract says the southern norm is valid, then what exactly is the set of expectations for her to have without reservation? This can be and can go very wrong.", "Info: did your wife (then girlfriend ) have her own room or did she share with you", "NTA. It\u2019s absolutely none of her business. Your wife and you found an arrangement you both felt comfortable with and made it work. This friend sounds extremely entitled, nosy, and clearly lives for creating drama. If she has always had her bfs pay for everything (and they both were happy with that) then great\u2026 the fact you guys live more as equal contributors vs a \u201ctraditional\u201d situation is great as well. There is nothing wrong with either scenario as long as both partners are happy with the situation.", "Lol. NTA. No one likes a mooch. And what Kate is describing is a sugar daddy, not a true gentleman.", "Having lived in both, that's not a North vs South thing. That's a her and her friends having a specific mindset and likely being spoiled thing. It happens everywhere, so let that bit go.\n\nWhat you said wasn't the most cordial way to handle the situation but she kicked open the door.

If you had used the actual word \"mooch\" you might have been,  but, nope. You actually didn't call her anything.  She just took the comment personally. I feel sorry for your friend.  He's in for quite a ride.", "NTA. I think Kate is stuck in the wrong century.", "My daughter's boyfriend (and father of her child) lives with her in her home and pays rent.  Why dhould one partner shoulder all the major expenses?", " NTA you decided what worked for both of you in the relationship but I also hope the rent was minimal, especially as the relationship progressed. Sharing expenses is one thing, but profiting off your partner is gross. Not enough details here to know which one it is.", "are Americans okay?", "Nta. I do find it odd that she continued to pay rent after you married as opposed to being added to the deed and paring toward the mortgage, but I find your wife\u2019s friend appalling and am also not surprised by the edit.", ">However your wife is not building any equity in the house despite paying money to live there.\n\nYeah, it's called \"renting\" and a lot of people do it.", "She is on the deed. He added her. \n\nOP, NTA.", "My wife paid rent until we combined finances. But I added her to the deed after the wedding.", "No more southern women than any other ways you want to break women down into groups would feel this way.  This is just OP being a lazy bigot.", "most people dont marry their landlords bestie", "then he's deffo NTA", "Yeah I was thinking this had to be fake after the whole \"Yankee men\" comment \ud83d\ude02 what?!? I'm from the south (live in the Northeast now) never have I heard that term used in a non joking way. There are differences in culture (like the relative time it takes someone to make a sandwich) but this comes off as someone who has no context of what 'southern' women are like...\n\nEdit to say I paid my husband rent before we were married", "Whaaaaaaaat?
