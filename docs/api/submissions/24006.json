Sounds like you guys have worked a way out that allows you both to save money together and both feel like you are taking on equal responsibility.", "I don\u2019t see anything wrong with both parties contributing financially whether dating or married. \n\nIf planning to have kids at some point, consider which of you should put your career on hold for any length of time, if necessary. If you can afford it, Sarah could contribute more to her retirement rather than current expenses. \n\nI never thought I would stay home with kids for as long as I did but that\u2019s what worked for our family. During those years my husbands 401k grew significantly while we didn\u2019t bother contributing towards mine. Looking back, it would have made more sense for me to max out my retirement accounts each year while we both had our own income and could easily afford it.", "NTA- I had to laugh. My daughter grew up about a mile and a half from the Gulf of Mexico and her husband is from New York. This is bull. My daughter is a triple certified teacher, (she\u2019s certified to teach three core subjects in school) and has her M.Ed. He is a deck boss on an ocean going ship. They both work their butts off. This \u201csouthern girl\u201d bull is a spoiled rotten kid. My daughter helped him through school, he helped her. That\u2019s a partnership.

You both should talk with a financial consultant on  ways to deal with it.", "NTA.\n\nThe \"men should pay for everything\" is why women are still 2nd class citizens in the US, and even less in The South.  \n\nIMHO, a modern partnership, romantic or otherwise, is about each partner putting in equal effort and resources.  Not all vocations earn the same revenue, so financial contributions can be pro-rated - or, if agreeable to both parties, one can provide more labor once kids come along based on earning potential and inclination to be home with kids full-time.  Or schedules can be shifted to avoid one parent having to quit their paycheck-earning vocation.  Whatever works for that couple.  But discussions and agreements need to be had before the relationship advances to far.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You expressed that you wanted something different than what she described for a relationship. And that was only after she rudely commented about your marriage. I think you were fine. Here\u2019s the thing - I have my own opinions about finances and marriage and I\u2019m guessing they don\u2019t match a fair number of my friends\u2019 current set up.

If your wife is happy with the situation then that\u2019s fine. The fact that you\u2019re making her pay rent is strange.

Honestly this is bizarre to me because she\u2019s essentially saying women need a man to take care of them. No we don\u2019t. I need a loving and supportive partner. I make my own money.

And one person isnt solely financially responsible for both, despite the 2nd person having income.
