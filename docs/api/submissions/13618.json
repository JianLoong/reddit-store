My SIL (20F) attends uni just outside of town and comes home on the weekends. So during the week her room is empty. \n\nThe issue is that we also have 2 kids (2.5M and 4F) and we have to share a room with our kids. I think that our kids should be able to sleep in SIL\u2019s room because she only uses it two days a week and she can easily sleep on the couch those days. \n\nMIL and FIL say that it\u2019s SIL\u2019s decision and they won\u2019t kick her out of her room. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair because she only uses it two days a week and during the holidays. She has a dorm room she can move her things into, she doesn\u2019t need her own room at home AND a room at uni while we have to share with our two kids.  \n\nI approached SIL about this and she called me an asshole, saying that I\u2019m a grown adult who shouldn\u2019t be living at home. But she\u2019s 20, she\u2019s also in adult. She shouldn\u2019t be living at home either but she just walked away when I said that. \n\nSo now I\u2019m stuck, having to share a room with my husband AND my two kids while there\u2019s a perfectly room that\u2019s empty 5 days a week. \n\nWIBTA if I just moved my kids in there anyway? My husband thinks we should as well. ILs have their room on a separate floor so they wouldn\u2019t know until SIL tells them, by which time it\u2019ll hopefully be too late and she\u2019ll leave it. \n\nI think that makes the most sense in this situation.", "created_utc": 1680250041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127efaz/wibta_for_moving_my_kids_into_the_spare_room/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A 20 year old is in a completely different stage of life from you and she\u2019s in school. \n- You\u2019d be sharing a room with your husband regardless? \n- Your kids, your problem. \n\nYou and your husband need to get your act together before you\u2019re kicked from the home and are on bad footing with your in-laws who didn\u2019t have to house you.", "Sooooo instead of gratitude, you feel entitled to make everyone else cater to your needs - in their house?\n\nThey took you in, they didn't need to. You asked about the room, they said no.\n\n Thats it, end of discussion.

You are so sickeningly entitled. Be grateful they\u2019re letting FOUR OF YOU live there. If you don\u2019t like the arrangement, move out. Oh, hubby is the AH for agreeing.", "So let me get this straight. You had to move out of your house (for whatever reason it may be) & your husband's parents allow you to **MOVE INTO THEIR HOME.** Now, you want to take your SIL's room away from her just because she may not be using it during the week but she still **COMES HOME ON WEEKENDS & YOU WANT HER TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH IN HER HOME** just because having your kids in the same room as you is inconveniencing you so she should make your lives easier?\n\nLeave your SIL's room alone, that's her space & she doesn't have to \"allow you to have it\" just because you had to move back home with your two kids for whatever reason.\n\nYTA..here's an idea. Move out. When you find a place of your own, then your kids can have a room of their own.

You do not get to march into other people's homes and dictate things to suit yourself. The absolute audacity of saying a 20yo college student should be an adult, while your 30 something self can mooch off your in-laws is just unbelievable. \n\nI understand you have hit a rough patch, but the entitlement in a situation where people are already doing you a massive favour is beyond me. Get your s*** together and stop trying to oust SIL from her own home because of your failures as an adult.", "YWBTA if you pursue this foolish idea. SIL is under no obligation to give up her own room. You might wind up back on the street. You and your family are GUESTS, so act like it.", "YTA you cannot be serious rn. You are a guest in their home. You have zero standing to make or break any rules. Sit yourself down, learn your place as a guest in their house, or else leave. Those are your options.", "YTA. Perhaps you should buy a pullout couch for the kids to sleep on in the living room.", "YTA. The owners of the house left it up to your SIL and she said no.

They may choose to continue to house your children and their son. \n\nMaybe instead of focusing on being worked up over the fact that you don\u2019t have a lot of space and zero privacy, you should focus on how to get your own place. I\u2019d guess that part of the in-laws decision is that if you\u2019re uncomfortable, you\u2019ll sort your shit out and get the fuck out faster. They probably don\u2019t *want* you to feel comfortable living there. They certainly don\u2019t want you making any more children you can\u2019t provide for.", "Yes YWBTA, but not a small one a huge one. She's maybe an adult but she is still at university so it's normal she still needs help.\n\nYou sound really entitled, so much that you don't even seem to realize how nice of them to take you, your husband's and your 2 kids in their homes.

And the room is not \u201cspare\u201d it is being actively occupied, two days a week and holidays is plenty, and her personal belongings are all still in there.

And on the path to being chucked out. It's not your house. If you aren't in a position to rent or buy your own place, you need to learn to be grateful for just having a roof over your own house.\n\nSure, it would be nice if your SiL would allow the kids to sleep there the nights she's not there, but it's still her home. The house owners have made it clear that it's up to her, and she's made it clear she doesn't want to have two small kids in her space. She's still effectively a child dependent as she's studying. You're a dependent because you are having financial difficulties, it's not the same thing. You're staying in her home, that room is hers, it's not your kids, nor are you entitled to it just because you find the accommodation you have been given crowded.", "Given that it is entirely your own self interest motivating your choices, I don\u2019t think you have the most balanced perspective.

That's a fact. This will become her all consuming issue until she has a stable space back. There is no possible way she would let that go. Your BEST bet is that you ask her to let them sleep there during the week and to make sure she always gets back to freshly washed sheets and a clean room. If she can lock her closet even better, but your kids taking over her room is a pretty clear non-starter.", "YTA. \n\nThe entitlement.

Your in laws said it's up to her. As it's her space. Doesn't she deserve a space that is hers alone? She said no. That's it.    It's not your room. Or your kids room.  You can't move in to a place that the homeowner is allowing you too then make demands.   That's a quick way to get an eviction notice.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add on here.  20 is not a fucking adult. She's a student. Shes a young adult trying to figure her way out.  You've barely figured shit out at that age. You, however, are a grown adult who's married and has a family.", "YWBTA big time. Leave her room alone.", "YTA for asking in the first place and thinking it\u2019s acceptable for your SIL to be happy about sleeping on a couch because your children took over her room. \n\nYou would be an even bigger AH for ignoring your in-laws, going behind their back, and deliberately disobeying their wishes. \n\nBe grateful that you have a place to stay at all, and stop being a terrible houseguest.", "YWBTA! You are a guest at your parents house because of your situation. It is your sisters room. It is not her fault, that you have no money for your own place.

Not respecting this person's boundaries is a serious violation of trust of the entire household. You and your family are guests.

My SIL (20F) attends uni just outside of town and comes home on the weekends. So during the week her room is empty. \n\nThe issue is that we also have 2 kids (2.5M and 4F) and we have to share a room with our kids. I think that our kids should be able to sleep in SIL\u2019s room because she only uses it two days a week and she can easily sleep on the couch those days. \n\nMIL and FIL say that it\u2019s SIL\u2019s decision and they won\u2019t kick her out of her room. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair because she only uses it two days a week and during the holidays. She has a dorm room she can move her things into, she doesn\u2019t need her own room at home AND a room at uni while we have to share with our two kids.  \n\nI approached SIL about this and she called me an asshole, saying that I\u2019m a grown adult who shouldn\u2019t be living at home. But she\u2019s 20, she\u2019s also in adult. She shouldn\u2019t be living at home either but she just walked away when I said that. \n\nSo now I\u2019m stuck, having to share a room with my husband AND my two kids while there\u2019s a perfectly room that\u2019s empty 5 days a week. \n\nWIBTA if I just moved my kids in there anyway? My husband thinks we should as well. ILs have their room on a separate floor so they wouldn\u2019t know until SIL tells them, by which time it\u2019ll hopefully be too late and she\u2019ll leave it. \n\nI think that makes the most sense in this situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What would you do if you moved the kids in there when she was there for the holidays anyway?\n\nI could see you getting kicked out the house for being sneaks and disrespectful of your IL's and your SIL.\n\nBy the way, don't think your kids wouldn't give you up way before the weekend came around, they are sure to excitedly tell their grandparents to come and look at their new room!\n\nEDIT: Here's a thought, why don't you and your husband sleep on the couch and let the kids have their own room.  Surely it wouldn't be an inconvenience - apparently", "YTA\n\nWhat part of NO did you not understand. Not your house. You do not get to just take it over. Move them in and you'll end up homeless.

There is an unspoken but ironclad rule of being a houseguest: make the hosts grateful to have you there despite all inconvenience that they are putting up with. Your first job is to find employment, but your other job is to foster a positive relationship and do every single thing possible to minimize household strife. If you take that room for even one night against SIL's wishes after having been told in no uncertain terms that it's her decision to make, then you wil put your entire family's tenancy there at serious risk. You don't like sharing one room? You are looking at having zero. Seriously, forget this foolish idea. Focus on mending fences with SIL, doing extra chores and errands for MIL and FIL without them asking, keeping the kids out from underfoot of the actual householders (MIL, FIL, SIL), showing respect for your role as burdensome guests, etc. Yeah that's a lot of work and stressful. Poverty sucks. Good luck in your job hunting so this phase of life can be mercifully brief.", "YTA, no doubt, but it is niggling me a bit that the grandparents don't want your children to be comfortable.

Go get a job. Even if it\u2019s minimum wage. Parenting is hard but there are plenty out there with less that do more.", "You aren't a real person. This is all bullshit.", "Stop making excuses. You do what you have to do. It isn\u2019t your in-laws responsibility to take care of you. The more you talk the more entitled and spoiled you sound.", "Caring for you two children includes cleaning up after them lol", "Cleaning up after yourselves and your children (ever, but especially as freeloaders) does NOT constitute maid service.  You should be bending over backwards to ensure you are massively contributing to household chores even beyond cleaning up after yourselves.  Helping the generous parents out with whatever you can", "You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. A room?? Lol you can\u2019t manage a room? Did you not clean your place when you lived in it? How did you do everything you were suppose too? You\u2019re made up of excuses. I\u2019m in the same situation as you and my parents have 2 extra bedrooms but my dad is sleeping in my old room. \n\nI was given the one room for me and my 2 girls. I can\u2019t force my parents to rearrange after I\u2019ve been gone for over 5 years. Like it\u2019s their home. It\u2019s not your home at the end of the day. Plus those aren\u2019t even your parents. You\u2019re going to start a lot of animosity between them if you move your kids in that extra room. That\u2019s your husbands sisters room. Not yours to dictate. Take this time to save and look for your own place so you can make your own rules and be grateful you had somewhere to go.", "How is that anyone else\u2019s problem except yours? And who the hell changes your sheets since you seem to think it\u2019s too hard for you to do.", "You could have the sheets changed and in the wash in the time you have spent on Reddit just today.", "oh no, you have to parent your own children how terrible for you", "Troll. Come on, at least write better villains with more nuance than this crap.", "Omg then how am I by myself able to care for one child, work a full time job, and do chores around the house\u2026 do I have fairies doing things that I don\u2019t know about? It must be magic", "Cleaning up after your young children is part of parenting. Your entitlement is embarrassing.", "The only thing you've been trying to find is a young woman's bedroom. Ain't no job listings in there. Be as motivated to get a job as you are about shoving your way into YET ANOTHER ROOM IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE!", "Are you aware that trying to find a job and looking after 2 kids is not a full time job for 2 people ?        \nYou have no excuse to not be able to look after your kids AND find a bloody job.         \nThere are plenty of jobs available in most countries IF you are actually willing to work", "If you don't have time to clean two rooms, look for jobs and take care of your children then I'm starting to understand how you ended up in this mess.\n\nYou do realise that if you had your own home you would have to take care of **a whole house** as well as working a full time job (longer hours than a job search) and take care of your kids?\n\nLoads of people do it every day. \n\nThe sooner you stop looking at what the world owes you and start looking at what you can do for yourself, the sooner your life will improve.", "How does \u201clooking after your kids\u201d not include cleaning up after them?!", "who will be looking after your kids if you get a job?", "Funny thing is all this time you've spent arguing with people u could've spent finding a job looking after your kids and cleaning up their mess. U have time you just don't know how to use it properly", "you're a bum and unlikeable, GREAT MIX!!! Has to be an act", "Try harder. Put some hustle into it. Look into PK programs you may qualify for based on income alone at the local public school. That could free up several hours of your busy schedule to accomplish some adulting. I can almost guarantee you are not sitting with your kids reading to them, playing with them, counting with them, practicing their colors and shapes with them, exploring nature with them, including them in your chores, showing them a routine. Get them in school. PFA, Headstart, something.", "You're not really taking care of your kids tho, you are not providing financially for them. Giving them a roof and providing them with their own rooms is taking care of your kids, right now you are a lazy bum mom.", "It does not take all day to apply for jobs and look after 2 kids. Grow a pair and start doing some work. Honestly.", "YES! You're absolutely right, that is potentially a better option if SIL is up for it. Still, OP really needs to be coming at it from a far more sympathetic stance than she is displaying here.", "And she has the audacity to say SIL is a burden? The one who is in college getting an education.", "She\u2019s not a single mum.      \nShe has a husband which means there are 2 of them there to look after the kids.", "Her financial problems aren't her in-laws problem. They graciously & kindly allowed them to move in to help them. She has the audacity as a woman in her 30's to question why her 20 year old SIL is still living at home, yet they are the ones who for whatever reason needed to move back home & now she's unhappy with the arrangements instead of being grateful that her CHILDREN HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. The entitlement is absolutely disgusting. She refuses to give their kids the room of their own & the parents sleep on the couch or vice versa. Nothing is good enough for OP & she feels they should cater to their situation instead of shutting up, saying thank you & making it work or, Idk, move out & make their own arrangements.", "> So how did you manage to work, care for 2 kids and clean a whole house before?\n\nPossibly why they don't have their own place now, kicked out from their rental because they didn't look after the place", "I don\u2019t as about to say the same thing. I have two kids and when they were younger I took care of my kids. Worked full time and kept the house cleaned up. All I hear are excuses so she can be lazy. She even has her husband there to help since he too is also unemployed. My husband traveled a lot for work so I was mostly doing everything on my own", "According to OP, it's not fair that SIL gets to have the room while they get nothing! Because according to OP, a 20 year old in Uni shouldn't be living at home either & it's not SIL house either apparently even though SIL comes home & that's her main residence. Yet both her husband & OP are in their 30's, both **unemployed,** can't contribute anything financially for the care & well being of their own children that they decided to have or to their in-laws who graciously allowed them to stay in their home as GUESTS. Basically free-loading moochers & choosing beggars who want the world to revolve around them. Because G\\*\\*-forbid OP & her husband aren't comfortable with their free accomodations!", "I think she\u2019s just making excuses.", "Sounds about right.\n\nThose poor kids!", "Tbh if I was the MIL I would tell my son his wife needs to find other living arrangements. They are lucky the in-laws haven\u2019t given them a deadline to move out either. They are being very generous and she is acting so entitled it is disgusting. If she put as much time and effort into find and obtaining a job as she did trying to get SIL room she would be better off financially. \n\nHonestly the more I read the more I realize OP is an AH. Especially with her excuse of being busy applying for jobs and looking after her kids to do anything else during the day", "I think she\u2019s just lazy and useless.      \nIt explains why they are both unemployed"]}
