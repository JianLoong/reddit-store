I know about this because my boyfriend told me after we became more serious. \n\nNow to present - Boyfriend and I went through a rough patch where it was long distance and I freaked out over a small issue and really became controlling and insecure. It was my fault and I accept it. We fought and I accepted my fault and we both took some time to think and realise what went wrong. \n\nIt was one of the most terrible phases of my life and to make it worse, Andy used to call me everyday with the choicest of words and  verbally abused me. The words used to range from \u2018You\u2019re an insecure piece of shit and he should never have dated you, you don\u2019t deserve anyone with your vitiligo..\u2019. This happened thrice. After that I stopped picking up his calls. \n\nI never mentioned this to my boyfriend and we eventually got back together after two weeks. \n\nTo this day, Andy constantly interrupts our dates with calls and how he wants my boyfriend To go On a double date with him (without me). My boyfriend never goes for any of this but he asks me to not take Andy seriously.

You told your bf the truth about what happened, and he decided not to be friends with someone who was rude, disrespectful, and verbally abusive.

Good on him for ending the friendship over this behavior.  \n\nMay you both find new, respectful, kind friends for a long and happy future.", "NTA you didn't ruin any friendship at all, Andy did", "NTA...Andy sounds terrible.  I want to say your boyfriend probably never knew HOW terrible until you disclosed what he had done during your break, and once he knew promptly ended the friendship, to his credit.  Maybe bf is sad because he never realized what a jerk Andy was...and seriously who does that?  Does Andy not have anything better to do than to berate his friend's girlfriend?  And why does he have your number to begin with?", "NTA\n\nBut your relationship sounds worrisome. \n\nWhy was your boyfriend friends with someone like that for 8 years? WTF is wrong with your boyfriend??? It's a good thing that friendship is over. \n\nI'm not convinced whatever happened when you \"freaked out over a small issue\" was really small either because you're downplaying or at least letting your bf downplay the behaviors of very abusive person. Calling you and saying that stuff is EXTREME behavior.\n\nI think you should go one step further and \"ruin\" your relationship with your bf, lol.", "NTA - You told your bf all the information and he made the decision. You can not and did not make him do anything. Let your bf make that decision", "NTA\n\nAndy is an ass for picking on your condition and being verbally abusive. Just have your bf\u2019s back - if he wishes to talk.", "NTA - Andy is def in love with your boyfriend", "NTA and I find it concerning that your bf decided to stay friends with Andy after the first time he told him he shouldn't date you because you have vitiligo.", "What did I just read.\n\nNTA - and block Andy.     You didn't ruin the friendship that's between your boyfriend and rude Andy.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin a decade-long friendship. Andy did - and it was a faux-friendship where he hid his true behaviour from his supposed friend.\n\nYou are both better off without him and his behaviour in your lives.\n\nAnd if anyone other than Andy is an AH here, it\u2019s your boyfriend for having stayed friends with him this long if he ever heard ANY of what he said to you about your relationship and your condition.", "NTA You do deserve good things despite what that ah says. If you feel in danger of retaliation from Andy record as much as possible (both audio and video) and take it to the police.", "NTA\nAndy ruined this relationship all by himself. It honestly sounds like he has more romantic feelings towards your bf. I hope you have told him about the phone calls Andy made to you and how you feel scared that Andy might retaliate against you.", "NTA. Also speaking as an outsider: i personally find vitiligo beautiful. It\u2019s unique and in a world with so many people, that is such a hard thing to find. Andy is an ass and it sounds like he\u2019s either into you or your bf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who needs a controlling, abusive, jealous \"friend\" like this?  I'd say their break-up is long overdue, and should have happened when Andy first disrespected you.", "NTA, you didnt ruin it, Andy did by being a prick. He didnt have to call you, insult your looks, or try to drive you apart, he could have just shut the hell up. But no, he was toxic and when you outed his behavior your boyfriend was disgusted.\n\nThis is Andy's own fault and your boyfriend is a good dude.\n\nThat said, you may want to ask how hes doing or talk with him. Losing a long time friend can feel like a romantic breakup and giving him some support could help.", "I'm actually curious if there's stuff she's hiding. The friend hasn't liked her from the beginning and she admitted to becoming controlling and freaking out about small things. Either yes she was manipulated into thinking she was worried over nothing or maybe she's always been kinda emotionally abusive and that's why the friend has never liked her and may lash out at her.

Totally unjustifiably rude.", "Or, the way this story usually goes on this sub, the bestie is gay and is secretly in love with the boyfriend. And this is just the only way he knows how to express himself because he\u2019s so deeply in the closet that he can\u2019t understand his own feelings.", "NTA. It was a long time coming.", "NTA. You did your boyfriend a favor.", "Easy NTA, frankly you should have called the police on Andy after one or two of his abusive phone calls.", "NTA, and you did not ruin the friendship, Andy did, with his actions, attitude, and being what sounds like a total piece of shi\\*. This is not on you, not at all, not in any way.", "Lotta leaps here.", "Yes I didn't even think about it from that angle. Either way she's not an AH for telling her what the friend did.", "I wouldn't say these are leaps. More like hops lol.

You had nothing to do with the friendship ending.", "I have vitiligo and I have some words for Andy as does my husband.", "NTA\n\nAndy sounds terrible and shallow...also but controlling", "I think that Andy is in love with Op\u2019s. Husband. He was jealous of her from day one without knowing anything about her.", "NTA- Andy\u2019s behavior is what ended the friendship.", "NTA. Andy's concern stemmed from your appearance- that's weird. Even if it was because of your personality, there's no reason to contact you and harass you.", "Right! \n\nEven if OP and her BF don\u2019t end up working out long term (which I hope they do, they\u2019re both showing growth), this shows her BF what his friend is capable of.
