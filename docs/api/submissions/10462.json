This is our first child so we're pretty excited. \nWe've chosen to keep the gender a secret, and just buy clothes we think are cute! Both our friends have new babies, so if we pick out a dress and it's a boy, we can just give it away, no waste! It's been so much fun, \n\nBut three days ago it kinda changed. I was with My mother in law (MIL) and she was asking us about baby names, and suggested a few, theodore, jackson, lars, and her persistent favorite \"jeerson\" . I was confused when i heard it, but apparently it was her late husband's name (he died when my fiance was 5 of an overdosing of pills) \n\nso she suggested we\n \"call him that\" I responded, \n\"what if it's a girl, and no offense but that name is really uncommon and very.. Special\" \nit kind of came our wrong but she started getting snarky with me,\n \"it's a boy. I can tell.\" she said, rubbing my stomach (without consent, also with her knowing I'm sensitive to touch due to aspergers) \n\nI brushed her hand away and suggested \n\" how about Se\u00e1n? \" she showed the most disgusted face\n\"No. We need an American name. Not Irish. You're not Irish anymore, you're american.\" I looked at her dumbfounded\n\nI was literally born and raised in cork before moving at 19. She knows this. \nBut I tried to suggest another to move on, \"how about Asha?\" she looked at me disgustedly\n \"my baby is a BOY! A BOY!\" she yelled louder, I tried to calm her down, \n\"okay okay, how about Leo?\" \nThat apparently was her breaking point. That's when it happened. She took the cup of coffee she had and threw it at me, it was HOT. hot i tell you. I quickly got up and left immediately, I didn't want to stay there any longer. I just stopped by a McDonald's to clean myself up. \n\nI drove home after that and told my husband he's was shocked and immediately went to tell him mother off. And of course this is where the crocodile tears come. \"She threatened me! She said I'd never Be able to meet my grandbaby if I didn't butt out and let her pick the name after I suggested your father's name!\" she cried. My husband is unsure of who to believe.\n\nHe said that even if i was telling the truth, I shouldn't of riled her up, and that her husband was the love of her life, and it would mean so much to her if we named our baby after him. \n\nHe's on the couch. \n\n\nAm I being too harsh? Are my \"other the top pregnancy hormones\" really taking over my \"sweet and kind\" personality? \n\nTell me Reddit, AITA?\n\nLil edit: I didn't realize how much people would be on my side, I appreciate the feedback, even when I'm added in the \"wrong people\" scale. You're right, I probably shouldn't of asked about names, but she had never mentioned wanting to name our baby after her late husband, and she seemed to be in a good mood.\n\nLil edit 2: lots of people think my fiance a bad person, and I can understand seeing it that way from the post, but he really is a selfless kind gentleman, he's overworked so we can afford our baby room AND wedding. \n\nI'll get through to him :) he's not a red flag I promise. <3", "created_utc": 1676915865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117fott/aita_for_not_picking_the_name_of_my_mother_in/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So you think I deserve to have hot coffee thrown at me- an actual crime- even if you believe MIL's version of events? If he does believe that, divorce. \n2. You aren't sure who to believe? Well then if you can't trust me, we shouldn't be together. \n3. So your mother threw coffee at me, and you think the main point of discussion should be if we can make her happy with the baby name? Ya, for now you are on the couch, but that won't be for long since we won't be under the same roof anymore. \n\nI need you to really understand here- your MIL assaulted you over potential baby names. You should be going full No Contact with her, if not calling the police on her. If your husband is \"unsure\" who to believe and in any way tries to excuse his mother's violence, then you shouldn't be with him. \n\nThere is no in between or compromise here. How your MIL acted, and how your husband is defending her, is how it will be for the rest of your life. Your husband needs to fully get it together or you need to run. RUN. Run away from this man and his mother, or your entire life will be miserable and violent.", " NTA but do go low contact or no contact with the MIL. Someone who can turn that violent over something that little is not someone you want around your baby. Never leave your baby alone with this woman!", "NTA - I'm so sorry this happened to you. Please check out the sub r/JNMIL - the whole \"my baby\" statement and the insane interaction in general fits well there. You'll get some good advice and if you show it to your FDH he will see how common this dynamic can be and may learn how to grow a shiny spine!", "NTA. She assaulted you and then lied about it. The fact that your husband doesn\u2019t have your back is really, really concerning.", "NTA and you need to inform the police of what she did and get a restraining order.", "Nta. Though make a birth plan that keeps her out of the hospital and have passwords to get in etc.", "NTA. Your mil is nuts. Don\u2019t go anywhere near her again especially alone. I would kick you husband out too. The fact that he excepted any excuse is bullshit. Idc if you wanna name your baby toilet. No one gets to physically assault you with hot coffee. You could have been seriously injured. As for the \u2018my baby\u2019 comment i would have lost my ever loving mind. This baby IS NOT HERS and it WILL NEVER BE HERS. That needs to be made VERY clear.", "Woah woah woah. You were assaulted and you are asking if you were in the wrong? No, no no. Also, your husband/fianc\u00e9/whatever he is, is the worlds biggest AH for not believing you.\n\nNTA and, girl, you need to put your foot down hard on these boundaries", "The woman threw hot coffee at you! Why weren't the police called? I bet the coffee shop has camera footage. The remark and that you shouldn't have riled her up, indicating that you were at fault for this should be the end to any real relationship. Any relationship between you and this woman who assaulted you over a name should be over and done with forever.", "NTA, your mil sounds like a delusional nightmare and your husband sounds like a mama\u2019s boy. Honestly keep yourself and your baby away from that women at all cost and talk to your husband about what happened and ask him \u201cDo you think I deserved to me treated that way? To be screamed at and have hot coffee thrown at me because I didn\u2019t agree with the name?\u201d If your husband can\u2019t side and defend you, still thinks you aren\u2019t telling the truth and is still saying \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have riled her up\u201d then I\u2019m sorry but it won\u2019t get any better from there. I\u2019ve seen so many post about women who married mama\u2019s boys and it never, ever ends well.", "NTA\n\nIf your fiance doesn't switch to supporting you 100% and stop blaming you for his mother going nutso, you have bigger problems than the MIL.\n\nShe is only a problem as much as your partner allows. If he is willing to excuse her current behavior, will he stand up for you and your child once they are born. \n\nBecause crazy people get wayyyyy worse after the baby is born. And you are going to be way more vulnerable.", "She assaulted you. I\u2019d go NC immediately. The fact that your husband is now supporting her is a huge problem. Please, consider leaving this toxic, abusive family.\n\n  Edit: NTA, obviously", "NTA, if this was my mother or MiL they would be on their final warning, any more temper tantrums over names and throwing fucking hot coffee at a pregnant person and she\u2019ll be cut out of the child\u2019s life.

I don\u2019t care what you said, that\u2019s completely unacceptable.", "Well now you HAVE to name him or her something Irish! Don\u2019t let Americans erase your heritage. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour MIL does not get a vote. So stop discussing it, and just refuse to name your kid after MIL's partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: it does not matter who your husband beelieves (even if he is an AH not to have your back) ... kids name are out unless they get TWO YESES. So it will be another name anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is COMPLETELY unreasonable to let MIL decide the kid's name. This is a discussion between husband and YOU.", "NTA but I'd be having a step up or step off fucking talk with my husband.

The fact he has the NERVE to say\n\n> that even if i was telling the truth, I shouldn't of riled her up, and that her husband was the love of her life, and it would mean so much to her if we named our baby after him. \n\nIt would be worse than the couch. You're going to have to fight to raise your own kid and you'll always be outnumbered 2:1 because you're a third wheel in your own relationship.

If she gets her way, she will think she can run your household. Stand your ground. MIL  like that don't get better, they get worse.", "NTA. It would be a very very long time before I let that woman around my baby. Where did this happen? Did they have security cameras? I would ask then show your husband who then can go home to mommy. Even if you don\u2019t get any video he can go home to her. Inform the nurses and hospital that she isn\u2019t allowed in the delivery room or recovery room. She sounds off her rocker and might try and bust in and your husband sounds like he wouldn\u2019t stop her!

Be very careful with this lady.", "NTA. Your MIL threw hot coffee on you and your fianc\u00e9 responded by telling you that you shouldn't have riled her up and he doesn't know who to believe? Even if you had deliberately upset her, throwing hot coffee on you is assault. And not acceptable. Shifting the blame to you is a form of abuse. I would be having a serious talk with fianc\u00e9. This is when he has to choose if he is your partner or his mother's son.  Waffling in the middle and not standing with you isn't going to get better and you will be dealing with this the rest of your relationship or until MIL dies. And, since MIL was able to successfully confuse and diffuse her son, she will get worse.", "NTA.", "NTA she is dangerous and an angry person be careful don't let her watch your child. Definitely don't name them jeerson either", "NTA she assaulted you, please contact the police. You also have a major DH problem.", "Make a police report. That will make it easier to get a protective order.\n\nNTA", "Oh honey, you have much bigger problems than an insane MIL.   Your fiance is who you should be worried about now because he is disregarding the fact that his mother assaulted  you and is threatening you.  This is not about naming your baby at all.  It's about your MIL wanting to have complete control over YOUR baby and your fiance is being weak and siding with his mother.  You need to put your baby's welfare and your own first.

He should file a police report on that harpy for harming you and your unborn baby. She should have zero presence in your life. She is a threat and a danger to you.

Thats up to you and your husband. And as far as I know, ultimately your decision when the baby is born (I don't have kids but assuming I'm correct on that). If you don't like the name she provided then don't call your baby that name if its a boy. As a fellow Irish person, I think if you like Se\u00e1n (and the baby is a boy) then go with that. You ARE still Irish and it will give your son a connection to your home. \n\nSecondly, she not only has no right to speak to you the way she did, but to throw hot coffee on you is assault. Its not something you deserved in any way and I would be keeping my distance. Your husband, in my opinion, needs to understand how serious it is that his pregnant partner was just assaulted by his mother. She's lucky you didnt call the police on her, never mind anything else. He needs to have your back on this. \n\nLastly, if I'm the long term this is settled and forgiven etc., I suggest being very wary around your MIL. She clearly has no self control and is not adverse to lying to get her own way. She may do something similar in the future. \n\nHopefully you can sort all this out and good luck with the pregnancy.", "NTA. This woman is clearly severely depressed from having lost her husband, called your baby hers, threw hot coffee on a pregnant woman and is lying to her son. Leave that family asap.", "NTA, if my mom would throw coffee at my wife it would be over. I love my mom, but I have chosen my wife. I will not spend the rest of my life with my mom. \n\nGood that I know that my mom would never do something like this :)", "Nta. \n\nYou have bigger problems then an abusive mil though. Your husband to be isn\u2019t to sure on who to believe? Did he forget which one he asked to marry? Congratulate him on his marriage to his mother.

Also touching you without your okay is NEVER okay", "Nta- the fact your husband doesn't believe you is alarming.

It's your baby, you get to name it.", "NTA - you can still press charges. And NEVER let her see that child. Leave your fiancee too and don\u2019t put his name on the birth certificate. Maybe even go back to Ireland and live with family since he\u2019s allowing the mother of his child to be assaulted.", "NTA. Even if trying to discuss the names did rile her up, your husband has to understand that his mom assaulted you. If she will assault you when pregnant with this grandchild she loves so much, she needs help. Goodness only knows what kind of behavior she will exhibit once \"her\" baby is born. Not saying she's evil, but she definitely is going through something and needs help. It's unacceptable that your husband can't recognize that and protect you and the baby.", "NTA but please DO KOT IGNORE THIS HUGE RED FLAG this woman is unstable and tried to scalled her pregnant daughter in law bc she didn't get her way then LIED ABOUT IT! Please never leave her alone with your baby.

And you have a FAR bigger fianc\u00e9. problem then you have do a mother-in-law problem.\n\nBecause even if everything your mother-in-law told your fianc\u00e9 had been true about you threatening to never let her see the baby, your mother-in-law threw hot coffee on a pregnant woman. And your fianc\u00e9\u2018s response was \u201cdon\u2019t rile her up\u201d.  Really?

Cmon, you know she\u2019s absolutely in the wrong. I don\u2019t understand how your husband won\u2019t believe you, you need to sit him down and go over what happened with her. Every little detail, and don\u2019t downplay anything. I get that her late husband was the love of her life, but there\u2019s no reason to act that way. My grandma lost my grandpa a few years ago, if this was me or any other cousin of mine, she wouldn\u2019t act in such a manner.

She literally assaulted you.", "NTA. File a police report.  You need to build a case if you end up needing a harresment order. Have it logged. Tell him you will never be in the same room as her alone. That you will record interactions.\n\nJust leave him.", "I suggest not spending any time with her alone and only allowing her to spend time with your children when you are around.

I am thinking this is going to be the first of MANY instances where you two disagree, she assaults you, and then turns into the victim making your husband reprimand you.  This is unacceptable.  What if that coffee caused some type of major burn?  What if a future fight involves this and she throws this coffee on the baby?  Nope, hard line when it comes to physical violence.

They're both lucky you didn't call the police and press assault charges because that's what that was!! And you need to remind them of that. An argument over names is not a reason to throw hot coffee on someone!! Especially a pregnant woman! I'm so pissed off for you right now.

That\u2019s assault, plus you\u2019re pregnant?? \n\nI also have a hard time believing your husband is divided because even if you did rile your MIL up she shouldn\u2019t throw a hot cup of water on you especially when it can hurt his child and any sane man would obviously defend you.", "NTA. Your fiance is showing you exactly how well he'll support and protect you and your baby. Which is not at all.

The entitlement and immaturity is absolutely off the charts. She literally assaulted you! She doesn\u2019t get a say in what you name your child (as you know). If your husband on his own wanted to honor Jeerson, he should have brought it up to you on his own. Sounds like he\u2019s just trying to placate his mommy now.

This is our first child so we're pretty excited. \nWe've chosen to keep the gender a secret, and just buy clothes we think are cute! Both our friends have new babies, so if we pick out a dress and it's a boy, we can just give it away, no waste! It's been so much fun, \n\nBut three days ago it kinda changed. My mother in law (MIL) was asking us about baby names, and suggested a few, theodore, jackson, lars, and her persistent favorite \"jeerson\" . I was confused when i heard it, but apparently it was her late husband's name (he died when my fiance was 5 of an overdosing of pills) \n\nso she suggested we\n \"call him that\" I responded, \n\"what if it's a girl, and no offense but that name is really uncommon and very.. Special\" \nit kind of came our wrong but she started getting snarky with me,\n \"it's a boy. I can tell.\" she said, rubbing my stomach (without consent, also with her knowing I'm sensitive to touch due to aspergers) \n\nI brushed her hand away and suggested \n\" how about Se\u00e1n? \" she showed the most disgusted face\n\"No. We need an American name. Not Irish. You're not Irish anymore, you're american.\" I looked at her dumbfounded\n\nI was literally born and raised in cork before moving at 19. She knows this. \nBut I tried to suggest another to move on, \"how about Asha?\" she looked at me disgustedly\n \"my baby is a BOY! A BOY!\" she yelled louder, I tried to calm her down, \n\"okay okay, how about Leo?\" \nThat apparently was her breaking point. That's when it happened. She took the cup of coffee she had and threw it at me, it was HOT. hot i tell you. I quickly got up and left immediately, I didn't want to stay there any longer. I just stopped by a McDonald's to clean myself up. \n\nI drove home after that and told my husband he's was shocked and immediately went to tell him mother off. And of course this is where the crocodile tears come. \"She threatened me! She said I'd never Be able to meet my grandbaby if I didn't butt out and let her pick the name after I suggested your father's name!\" she cried. My husband is unsure of who to believe.\n\nHe said that even if i was telling the truth, I shouldn't of riled her up, and that her husband was the love of her life, and it would mean so much to her if we named our baby after him. \n\nHe's on the couch. \n\n\nAm I being too harsh? Are my \"other the top pregnancy hormones\" really taking over my \"sweet and kind\" personality? \n\nTell me Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The decision about the name of YOUR baby is your decision. You can choose a name to honor someone you've been close to, but if you don't know her husband there is no reason you would name the baby like him especially if you don't like the name. She was violent with you and didn't respect your boundary and didn't even tried to listen to you, major red flags. She didn't listen to you regarding the gender of your baby and gender neutral option and I found it really strange that she insisted it a boy. I'm not sure, but it could be a sort of \"projection\", which could also explain why she wanted to name it by her dead husband's name. That's a theory but it would explain her weird and intense reaction to your name choices and explanations that were really reasonable.\nNot to mention the reaction of your husband.", "NTA. Your MIL literally called *YOUR* child \u201cMY BABY\u201d\n\nYou are just an incubator for this woman.

Don't hide anything.", "Yikes. YIKES. Very very big YIKES. That's all I can say.\n\nNTA.

Run, girl.", "Your baby\u2019s name shouldn\u2019t be discussed w/ anyone other than your SO for this reason. And he should discuss w/ no one. Your MIL is nuts.", "I'm a bit freaked out by your MIL calling it \"her baby\". \n\nNot grandbaby, not son's baby. HER BABY. \n\nThat by itself would be enough to make me never be alone with her or leave the child alone with her EVER. At least not until the child is old enough to enforce their own boundaries and tell you honestly what happens with other adults. \n\n\"Grey rock\" will be your friend on this. You have every right to choose what you name your own child. The only people whose input matters is yours and the baby's father. \n\nThrowing coffee, or anything else for that matter, at you is another huge red flag. She insulted your heritage. More flags. She has no respect for you and no impulse control. Both bad things. The reasons keep mounting to stay away from her.\n\nIt occurs to me to wonder if there are redeeming qualities in this woman. If so, weigh them carefully against the dangerous things. If she is habitually snide or backhanded when interacting with you or your fiance, that weighs badly. If she usually has a better temper and this incident is an outlier, that seems neutral. If she is normally helpful and kind and this was far out of normal behavior for her, that weighs well.\n\nOverall, OP you are most definitely NTA. You have some serious discussions to get through with your fiance. You need to see how he reacts to new boundaries with your MIL, and see if he can at least accept that since she was rotten first, your relationship is now strained, at least for the time being. Your fiance needs to sort out for himself how much he really trusts his mother versus how much he knows of you. He will have to get very good at defending the boundaries if he is to be an effective partner for you. His accusation of \"riling her up\" hints to me that he knows she has a temper problem and just doesn't want to deal with it. That needs to be sorted before the baby arrives. He either needs to hold the boundaries or admit he prioritizes her over you. If the second is his choice, you need a major backup plan. Fast. I saw in another comment the idea of going back to Ireland as a backup plan. To me that seems extreme, but if you decide it's necessary then do it before the baby is born. Based on past experiences sponsoring someone through immigration to the US, you will likely have easier time \"bringing an American Citizen to meet extended family\" (down the road once the baby can travel) than you would exiting the country with a citizen too young to speak for themselves. (That may be just my one experience though, so take it with a pound or two of caution.) \n\nI hope everything works out well for you, OP. Blessings for a safe pregnancy and delivery.", "NTA, stay away from the MIL, don't give her any info about the baby, if you need to be alone with her record it.
