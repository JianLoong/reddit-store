Based on her reaction, it sounds like, after she said she didn't want to go down there, you never made it clear you still planned to, but also, neither of you saw the problem as something to directly discuss once she brought up her chance of thought.\n\nYou are allowed, as a full independent person, to do what as you please and think what you think, as she is, but to not try and discuss a (now) major point of friction with your spouse just seems almost petty.

How did a conversation not ensue after that?", "Ehm, mild yta, because I think when your wife said \"I don't want to go down this winter\" it was implied she was referring to your family unit and not just herself. So that was the opportunity to discuss with her you had a firm boundary about not changing the plan, and allowing her to adjust to the idea of spending some time apart if that's the only solution.  Acting all surprised like obviously she meant you would just be living separately for four months is kinda weird.\n\nGoing forward, NAH...priorities change. Hers did, with the grandkids, and probably realizing she wanted to be around you all's  own kids more too.  That change in her vision for the future is going to be a big adjustment for both of you, but it seems like there's room for compromise in terms of splitting the time spent in both countries, and spending some time alone each winter too, if necessary. For as long as this plan has been in motion, for her to have a change of heart is very serious and deserves a little more intentional convo from the both of you", "NTA. This is similar to my dream. If my wife all of a sudden decided she didn't want to go, I'd be pretty upset. And I'd still go anyways lmao. Enjoy your retirement.", "NAH.  People change their minds/attitudes about big life decisions through the years.

So get couples counseling or hire a divorce attorney", "ESH. \n\nYou're both operating like you're not a married couple. She wants to stay close to her grandkids. That is absolutely acceptable. I would want that, too. You made your plans 20 years ago and have decided there's zero grounds for any sort of wiggle room, regardless of what life has given you.

It really isn't fair to either of you and it is clear that you both don't communicate, or at least haven't on this one.\n\nThere is middle ground where you are both back and forth and maybe the cold is harder on you physically so you stay there more often, but to be so black and white, when it's a lot more nuanced, is really disingenuous. \n\nI live in NE and know quite a lot of people who snowbird.

Try to find some compassion for her, because it's likely that one of the reasons she's only now saying this is that she didn't want to disappoint you, but now that it's down to the wire her choices are say nothing and be unhappy, or talk with you and try to find something that both of you can live with.\n\nShe also very likely had no idea how having grandkids would affect her own desires/plans around retirement age. 35 years is a *long time*, man.

I personally think there is nothing wrong with not being joined at the hip for every minute of life's activities.

They had Major Health Crisises which required their children to abandon **their** children and families to see them past the worst. Then they were too sick to relocate near us. We grieved because we were not there to oversee their health care and needs. They passed away while we were still trying to find a means to move them back. The extended family in the peanut gallery is a whole nother story.\n\nSo, I understand your desires and anger that your wife is changing the game on you at this late date. That's all valid.

It is not reasonable to think OPs wife was suggesting he go alone.\n\nHe knows he could have easily said that hes still going when they had this conversation. But he didn't.

Now, he can choose to pull the trigger and buy that lake house in the middle of nowhere as he always has said he wants to do.

She's allowed to do that, but she is not free from the consequences of doing that.  And the consequence has turned out that he has chosen his dream over her.
