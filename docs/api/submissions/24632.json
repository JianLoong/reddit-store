I put in 33 years of work and I'm done. I bought property in South America 12 years ago and I have been building our retirement home down there. I have dual citizenship so I can own property without it being a hassle. \n\nThe house was designed to be perfect for us. We have a pool, a small house for the caretaker/hardener, and 34 different fruit trees. The bathroom is up to North American standards and the shower has grab bars and stuff already built in for when I'm old. Everything is on one level so there are no stairs. My wife helped by making suggestions to the design of the house and by taking care of decorating it. \n\nWe have been vacationing there for eight years now and renting it out when we aren't there for some extra money. We have hosted friends and family there both with us there and on their own. \n\nMy wife has now decided that she doesn't want to live there for seven months of the year. We have grandkids now and she wants to be more involved in their lives. \n\nI love my kids and grandkids. And my parents who also live up here. But I am done with winter. If I never see snow again it will be too soon. \n\nThe house has guest rooms and flights are cheap. If they want to see me in the winter they are all welcome to come down. Plus I will be back for five months in the summer to do some contract work. I will see everyone then. \n\nMy wife said she didn't want to go down this winter. And that is absolutely her right. I booked my flight for September and she asked me about the expense on the credit card. I said I was leaving for the winter like I had told everyone I was planning to do. This is when she said that \"she didn't want to go this winter\" actually meant \"she didn't want us to go this winter\". \n\nI said that I was going and that I would see her in the spring unless she changed her mind and came down. \n\nNow her, my parents, and my kids are bugging me about leaving her alone for the winter.  It is 100% her choice.", "created_utc": 1692028149, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qyf1y/aita_for_retiring_and_moving_to_south_america/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Enjoy retirement.", "NTA \n\nEveryone knew the plan.", "nta. enjoy your retirement!", "NTA you have been *very* upfront, and she should have spoken up *years* ago if this was an issue for her.", "NTA... she cant dictate what you do. You can discuss compromises. But um guessing she is nervous about change. I'd see how things go. Either of you can fly for a visit.", "NTA. That sounds ideal, throw in no mobile phone, social media, or email for the months you're down there (contact by letters only) and make it a cold country instead of a warm one and you're living my ideal life.", "Comment from OP:\n\n*<She has known since we started dating 35 years ago that this was my plan.

You don't even come back for the holidays? That may be an \\*ss move, and for sure your wife would want to be around for holidays. September is very early to be a snowbird, where are you from that winter starts that early.", "NAH. Your wife obviously had some concerns about the big move that she didn't share with you. Your intent seems to have been pretty clear based on your presentation, so I'm not sure where the confusion comes from. Especially since, as you say in a comment, she helped plan the whole thing with you.", "NTA but from what I am reading you both are bad at communication. You need to check in with each other more often than \"see you in the spring.\" or that for her to be surprised by a card charge. If I were you I would look into a couples counselor as soon as possible and get a session in to help you both communicate and a third party is very helpful is keeping you both out of the  denial trap.", "I'm gonna go esh\n\nThere's no way you didn't know she meant she didn't want either of you going when she said she didn't wanna go, but she also should have said that from the very beginning. You knew you were picking a fight when you got the ticket, and she tried to unilaterally change the plan without discussing it with you. \n\nYou two's complete lack of communication on the issue caused the fight. Either start *talking* to each other, or just get divorced and you can go to the home you built for your retirement.", "NAH, but it does sound like maybe you guys should work on communication", "It has always been your plan, not hers. She supported you as long as it did not interfere with her priorities. Now it obviously does. Making your wife select between a lonely time with a grumpy aging partner in a foreign land and all her friends, relatives and grand-kinds is a tough choice, you will need to compromise or this becomes a road to separation.", "YTA - if she says she doesn\u2019t want to go this winter, then you talk about you going separately. You are married- if you guys aren\u2019t going to be in the same place for a long period of time, you talk about it beforehand. If my partner says he doesn\u2019t want to do something, then we discuss me doing it separately. I really don\u2019t get the N T As", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because this can become a big deal.", "Why wouldn't she have expected him to go? She said she wanted to stay, she didn't say she wanted them to stay nor did she ask him if he would stay with her.
