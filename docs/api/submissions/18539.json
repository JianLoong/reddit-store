We have a 4 month old baby, every night we give him a bath, she nurses him and then she puts him down for the night. He sleeps well throughout the night waking up a few times to nurse and go back to sleep. We have one bathroom and it shares a wall with our bedroom. Basically, most nights my wife will take a big poop in the middle of the night and then not flush it, then I will get up to pee and smell it sitting there in the toilet. I flush it everytime because I find it gross and low and behold baby never wakes up... I told her I want her to start flushing because I find it gross and it doesn't wake him up and she is telling me that she will not start flushing because it's going to wake him up. Am I the asshole for insisting she flushes??? I feel like I'm not in the wrong here. Her exact words are, \"you\u2019re clearly trying to making me feel shame or something and I just don\u2019t care.

You knew that already, though, because you're also changing the baby's diapers... right?\n\nShe's waking up a few times to nurse every night. She's functioning on the kind of sleep deprivation that shuts down people's brains. Waking up to nurse is normal for a baby and it can be hell on an adult. Imagine for a second she's in the bathroom at 2am, she's just gotten the baby down again, she's looking bleakly at the chance for maybe one uninterrupted sleep cycle, maybe... but if she flushes, maybe not. Maybe she'll be awake for another two hours. Maybe it's different when the baby's *just* gone to sleep, maybe a soft sound is more likely to wake him up then than when he's deeper down.\n\nEven if there's only a 1% chance that the flush wakes the baby, she's not gonna roll those dice.", "........NTA. Not flushing the toilet is disgusting and I would be disgusted if I had an s/o that didn't flush. I wouldn't want to walk into the bathroom to see someone's peepeepoopoo on the toilet with the smell wafting all around the bathroom!

I've had to turn the water down so it doesn't run as long filling back up. Regardless, if it's brown, flush it down. You put the seat down, and it reduces the noise.

That's it. When you do this bucket method, you get a bucket (which might make noise), fill the bucket (running water and maybe for longer because of the faucet's flow without the sound insulation of this happening inside of a porcelain tank), water is poured from above into the toilet bowl (more noise and maybe some splashing), the toilet flushes (same noise) and the bucket is put down/away (potentially more noise). And that's of you can even get her to do it. You won't. \n\nAs others have said, your best move here is convincing your wife that your baby needs to learn to sleep through basic household noises like the toilet flushing.", "No problem, hope it works out.

Maybe it won't wake the baby when she flushes the toilet.  That's not the important part.  What matters is that she is doing the task of taking care of your son and doesn't want to be told how to do it.  Your son poops all the time and whoever cleans it off of him is a lot more up close and personal with the poop than you are with the dump she takes in the middle the night.\n\nIn the end, it's about cooperation between you both.

It seems like this might be less about the toilet flush and more about her feeling like she\u2019s pulling more weight during the bedtime routine. From what I\u2019ve heard, postpartum emotions and brain fog can be wild.", "This makes sense in theory, but I have a husband who, try as he might, just cannot get the baby back down sometimes. Sometimes she lets him, sometimes she screams until I come back which means I'm also not sleeping. It's usually faster and less stressful for everyone to do it myself, as great as it is that he's trying.", "I agree that she should flush, but I also think you need to have a little more empathy for her.

I\u2019m Australian if that helps? I just meant it\u2019s not that simple, especially when the baby is 4 months old. Getting engorged hurts like a bitch and can lead to mastitis."]}
