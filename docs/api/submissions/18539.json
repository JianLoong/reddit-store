{"id": 18539, "submission_id": "13vevt1", "title": "AITA Wife not flushing poop", "selftext": "Basically what the title says. We have a 4 month old baby, every night we give him a bath, she nurses him and then she puts him down for the night. He sleeps well throughout the night waking up a few times to nurse and go back to sleep. We have one bathroom and it shares a wall with our bedroom. Basically, most nights my wife will take a big poop in the middle of the night and then not flush it, then I will get up to pee and smell it sitting there in the toilet. I flush it everytime because I find it gross and low and behold baby never wakes up... I told her I want her to start flushing because I find it gross and it doesn't wake him up and she is telling me that she will not start flushing because it's going to wake him up. Am I the asshole for insisting she flushes??? I feel like I'm not in the wrong here. Her exact words are, \"you\u2019re clearly trying to making me feel shame or something and I just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s poop. My life is really hard and stressful and I\u2019m the one getting [baby] to sleep, if flushing is going to wake him up I\u2019m not doing it\"\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the suggestions and feedback. I definitely think that if she feels the need to not flush its because she's stressed out and I'm not doing enough to help so it's given me a new perspective and made me reassess how much effort I've been putting into helping her at night. She has been doing the most to try and let me sleep so I'm rested for work but thats not fair to her and I see that now", "created_utc": 1685416357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vevt1/aita_wife_not_flushing_poop/", "score": 397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's functioning on the kind of sleep deprivation that shuts down people's brains. Waking up to nurse is normal for a baby and it can be hell on an adult.

Maybe she'll be awake for another two hours. Maybe it's different when the baby's *just* gone to sleep, maybe a soft sound is more likely to wake him up then than when he's deeper down.\n\nEven if there's only a 1% chance that the flush wakes the baby, she's not gonna roll those dice.", "........NTA.

But I\u2019m sure the wife doesn\u2019t tip toe in dead silence every time the baby is sleeping. I would imagine she works around the house during the day getting chores done while baby naps, and probably even flushes the toilet too. But we\u2019re talking about nighttime here. The baby may not have a biological clock yet, but mom does, and hers says \u201cat night, I sleep\u201d. She\u2019s likely desensitizing the baby to everyday noise plenty during the day, but at night when her body is craving sleep the most, she\u2019s not risking it. Couple that with the fact that she is probably taking her nightly dump right after she puts baby back down from a night feed, meaning baby JUST fell back asleep and is not in a deep sleep yet so will be more easily stirred. As gross as it is, there\u2019s a little logic here, especially for someone in her state. Baby doesn\u2019t wake up when OP gets up to pee and flushes, but by this time it\u2019s likely that the baby has been down for a while and is sleeping deeper and not so easily disturbed. \n\nAgain, not flushing a turd is gross, but I think the wife deserves a little grace and understanding here. She\u2019s not just some nasty slob who never flushes her poo. She\u2019s living in zombie land right now, but will be back to normal soon and will (hopefully) start flushing again. If she doesn\u2019t, well then there\u2019s a problem. \n\nAnd for anyone giving OP hell for not getting up with the baby at night, working a full time job absolutely counts as pulling weight as a parent. He helps with the baby during the day when he\u2019s home, and works full time to support financially. You can\u2019t be productive at your job if you\u2019re constantly up and down all night with a baby.

I remember the days of my son being an infant and me being his primary caregiver. As amazing as it was having a new baby and becoming a mother, those were some of the worst and hardest days of my life. The sleep deprivation was something most can\u2019t even begin to comprehend. That on top of healing physically from birth, hormones still trying to balance out, and my body being used as an on demand feeding machine, I was depleted in every aspect. The desperation for just a little more sleep can cause irrational fear, and the sleep deprivation itself causes irrational anxiety and thought processes. \n\nNot flushing poop is absolutely disgusting, I agree, and in any other scenario, I\u2019d say stand your ground, but in this case, I say try to give your wife a little grace and understanding. This is only temporary. Once she and the baby are on a more reasonable schedule, she\u2019ll start flushing again. No, you are NTA, but neither is she. She\u2019s just exhausted, man. Exhausted in a way that I can\u2019t even begin to describe. I don\u2019t like comparing a mother\u2019s role to a father\u2019s role, because I believe they both present their own challenges and both deserve respect, but there is one small area that a father will never have to endure and will never fully understand- hormones. They are real and they are brutal, and unfortunately there\u2019s not shit we women can really do about the severe fluctuations we experience postpartum. They affect our bodies, our mental state, our emotions, our rationality, and our behavior. That doesn\u2019t give any woman an excuse to be an AH, but it does mean we need a little more grace while we transition back to being a normal human being. \n\nTLDR- neither of you are the AH.

Let\u2019s just say that idea came very easily to me because my son didn\u2019t develop any regular sleeping pattern until he was 15.  I was sleep deprived for 15 years.
