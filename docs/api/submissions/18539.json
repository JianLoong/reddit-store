We have a 4 month old baby, every night we give him a bath, she nurses him and then she puts him down for the night. He sleeps well throughout the night waking up a few times to nurse and go back to sleep. We have one bathroom and it shares a wall with our bedroom. Basically, most nights my wife will take a big poop in the middle of the night and then not flush it, then I will get up to pee and smell it sitting there in the toilet. I flush it everytime because I find it gross and low and behold baby never wakes up... I told her I want her to start flushing because I find it gross and it doesn't wake him up and she is telling me that she will not start flushing because it's going to wake him up. Am I the asshole for insisting she flushes??? I feel like I'm not in the wrong here. Her exact words are, \"you\u2019re clearly trying to making me feel shame or something and I just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s poop.

Flush it. \n2) You\u2019re supposed to get everything going when the baby sleeps so they get used to it; toilet flushing, vacuum, washing machine, stereo if you have one. Being quiet means when you have a toddler, they\u2019ll wake up to the sound of an ant farting 4 gardens away. \n\nEDIT: Seems relevant to add \u201cqualifications\u201d when talking about anything parenting related so to quantify, I say the above as a Dad of 3 \ud83d\udc4d you\u2019re both doing a great job. Navigating a first baby is a rollercoaster for everybody because no matter what books you\u2019ve read or things you\u2019ve been told, everybody goes in blind and has no idea what they\u2019re doing.

No-one wants their bathroom stinking of poo for hours. \n\nAs a compromise, suggest a bucket. She can fill it from the tap and pour it down as a manual flush. Quieter than a toilet flush and you don't have a stinky bathroom.\n\nOr agree to be the one who settles him if the toilet flushing wakes him up.", "I'd say NTA. Look, I don't have kids, but I've never heard of parents letting turds pile up in the toilet for fear of waking their babies. That sounds pretty gross.", "NTA\n\nThats nasty to just leave it.", "NTA\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s brown flush it down, if it\u2019s yellow let it mellow.\u201d Oh, wait that\u2019s if you\u2019re in a drought situation.\n\nShit gets flushed. End of discussion.\n\nThe baby needs to be able to sleep with noises around. Flushing the loo shouldn\u2019t wake the baby, walking around the house or talking at normal volume shouldn\u2019t wake the baby, having the tv or stereo on shouldn\u2019t wake the baby. A well trained baby will sleep anywhere.", "No you\u2019re not. \n\nHave a white noise machine along with a fan blowing or some combination like that. The baby won\u2019t wake up. \n\nI have four kids and when my oldest was about 6-7 months, my wife and I agreed we can\u2019t have it completely silent.

I've dealt with three newborns. Never was leaving shit in the toilet necessary. Ever. That's disgusting. My babies wouldn't take bottles so nights were on me. I was exhausted. I still flushed because flushing is muscle memory and mandatory. If she told me I was making her feel shame I'd say good, cause you should feel shame over that.", "Okay I know exactly how your wife feels because I'm the one putting our daughter down repeatedly at night too, and I *sometimes* leave pee if I'm not sure she's fully asleep yet, but dear God NEVER poop!!

Your wife, however, sounds very stressed, are you helping her with the child care?", "NAH.\n\nYou've proven that the baby doesn't wake up at a flush. Great! And yeah, poop is gross. You knew that already, though, because you're also changing the baby's diapers... right?\n\nShe's waking up a few times to nurse every night. She's functioning on the kind of sleep deprivation that shuts down people's brains. Waking up to nurse is normal for a baby and it can be hell on an adult. Imagine for a second she's in the bathroom at 2am, she's just gotten the baby down again, she's looking bleakly at the chance for maybe one uninterrupted sleep cycle, maybe... but if she flushes, maybe not. Maybe she'll be awake for another two hours. Maybe it's different when the baby's *just* gone to sleep, maybe a soft sound is more likely to wake him up then than when he's deeper down.\n\nEven if there's only a 1% chance that the flush wakes the baby, she's not gonna roll those dice.", "........NTA. Not flushing the toilet is disgusting and I would be disgusted if I had an s/o that didn't flush. I wouldn't want to walk into the bathroom to see someone's peepeepoopoo on the toilet with the smell wafting all around the bathroom! And also...flushing the toilet is easy.....there isn't much of an excuse to not flush the toilet. And as you've seen yourself, flushing the toilet doesn't wake your baby up.", "Nta.\n\nMy bathroom is between my child's room and my own. That thing is loud. I've had to turn the water down so it doesn't run as long filling back up. Regardless, if it's brown, flush it down. You put the seat down, and it reduces the noise. My child rarely, if ever, woken up from it in four years. \n\nIf bub wakes up, help your wife to put them back to sleep. I know she's breastfeeding, but sometimes we employ other methods to get them back to sleep.", "NTA. That's filthy!", "NTA Your wives nasty.", "Lmfao don\u2019t make her feel bad is it such a big deal that u have to flush is", "I\u2019m so torn here. On the one hand leaving a turd in the toilet is gross. Like really gross and I would shit my own brick if I walked in on that. \n\nOn the other hand, if she is the one getting up to feed this baby multiple times a night and is exhausted and overwhelmed I can sorta see her being upset that you can\u2019t just flush it for her\u2026\n\nUmm so I\u2019m going to say, if your wife isn\u2019t caring to flush her own poop, you should do more to help her and then expect her to flush her own poop.

That's it. When you do this bucket method, you get a bucket (which might make noise), fill the bucket (running water and maybe for longer because of the faucet's flow without the sound insulation of this happening inside of a porcelain tank), water is poured from above into the toilet bowl (more noise and maybe some splashing), the toilet flushes (same noise) and the bucket is put down/away (potentially more noise). And that's of you can even get her to do it. You won't. \n\nAs others have said, your best move here is convincing your wife that your baby needs to learn to sleep through basic household noises like the toilet flushing.", "No problem, hope it works out.

Mine is very noisy as it refills, a bucket is definitely quieter and quicker. As for the tap noise, my thoughts were to fill the bucket up before bed and leave it beside the toilet. It is also possible to place an empty bucket down quietly if you are not a knuckle dragger.\n\nAbsolutely it's better for the baby to sleepy through the noise but if Mom is dying on this hill, the normal logic is unlikely to appeal to her. Sleep deprivation will make you stick on the weirdest things.", "Thank god!", "That was the situation for us. I do shift work as a 911 dispatcher so I do really need to be sharp at work.
