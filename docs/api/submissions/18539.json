I suggest you lay out your argument rationally \u2014that when you get up, you flush and it doesn\u2019t wake the baby\u2014and if it doesn\u2019t take, just let it go. This part of your life won\u2019t last forever. And while the other Redditors are correct that the baby needs to learn to sleep with noise, the kid isn\u2019t going to go to college requiring utter silence. They will learn at some point along the way, or they\u2019ll get earplugs. Don\u2019t make this bigger than it has to be.", "Tell her to use the bathroom correctly. If she\u2019s scared of waking the baby up, then shit during the day.", "YWNBTA as long as you will take responsibility if you wake the baby. If you are so certain it won't wake, that should be easy. Your wife sounds super stressed, not an AH.", "NTA. Gross.", "NTA for wanting her to flush her poops, but i could read the cry for help in your description. \n\n>My life is really hard and stressful and I\u2019m the one getting \\[baby\\] to sleep,\n\nHelp her so she can have the energy to care about flushing her poops again.", "If it\u2019s yellow let it mellow.

If your baby only ever sleeps when it is perfectly quiet and pitch black in the room, you're not going to have much fun.\n\nFor my kids, we simply put them to bed and acted as normal. They do not wake up. Kids are out cold once they're asleep. My friends literally will open their kid's door in the middle of his nap, and vacuum in the room. He does not wake up. That is a legit true story that I have personally seen them do, and they have done it since their 7 year old was a newborn, and hae done it with both their next 2 kids. They do not wake up. While I personally think that vacuuming in their rooms is extreme and playing with fire with respect to waking your kid up, the point is, kids will sleep through a lot.\n\nNTA, your wife is being disgusting, and isn't helping the baby or herself as much as she thinks she is.", "Just embrace the smell and enjoy it. Soon she'll be dead and you'll yearn for the smell of ripe shit in the early AM", "INFO: Did you try to make an agreement where if she does flush and the baby does wake up you'll be the one to take charge as best you can?", "Nta, your wife must have dealt with this at her old home. this is not normal.", "NTA brown flush it down if the baby can\u2019t sleep through a toilet flush your in for a world of hurt", "i used to vacuum under the crib while the baby was sleeping to get her accustomed to the fact that noise happens. \n \nshe turned out ok\n\nnot flushing poop is rude, crude and socially unacceptable.", "Get baby used to normal household noises now. \n\nOP May I suggest that you offer wife a trade: she flushes and you agree to out baby back to sleep should that wake him?", "Exactly.

He's not asking her to host a State Dinner or qualify for the Olympics.", "I\u2019d wake my husband up every time I had to breastfeed the baby at night then. Why should he sleep if she can\u2019t? That would be a dealbreaker for me.", ">She\u2019s a postpartum mom doing what I\u2019m sure is all the work. Shut your trap and flush it.\n\nThat's the entire issue; his gross wife isn't flushing her own shits and doesn't want OP to do so either because she doesn't want to risk waking the baby. Wild to make assumptions that she's doing all the work when there's nothing to indicate as much. Sounds misandrist to me.", "Just get up with your own damn baby if it wakes up due to flushing and stop making your wife do all of the day shift and all of the night shift.", "I vacuumed in my kids rooms for this exact reason.", "My dad used to tinker with his stereo system after I went to bed.

Make sure your wife is getting as much sleep as humanly possible before you make her wake up more.", "you can save water by using the bucket to catch the shower water while the shower warms up, instead of filling it from the tap every time.", "And why aren't you the one putting the baby to sleep?", "You are definitely NTA here, it's hygienic to flush and I've never heard of a toilet waking up a baby anyway.\n\nBut, this might be one of those things where you just have to suck it up. Make it clear to her that it's not about shame it's about hygiene, but that you will flush when it's needed if that's what she needs as partner support. I would gently add that it's concerning to hear her say that she just doesn't care about your feedback, that's not healthy in a relationship. \n\nThen get yourself some deodorizing spray and a scented candle to burn.\n\nThought: have you tried a white noise machine near the baby? \n\n(PS off the record...

Slept like a log", "No, but if she\u2019s exhausted she\u2019s probably not thinking rationally. At four months, her body is still healing from the pregnancy. That uses a lot of energy, plus all the work of caring for the baby, breastfeeding if she is, getting up at odd hours of the night, etc depletes her energy. She is probably very tired and doesn\u2019t want to take chances. \n\nI think they should test it during the day when the baby is napping. Both parents present to see what happens.

She should totally just flush. \n\nI was just pointing out that I pumped all the time and got engorged plenty on the occasions Baby slept longer than normal.

I was just trying to say the last thing she wants is to be engorged during the night which will wake her up and defeat the purpose of sleeping through the night anyway.
