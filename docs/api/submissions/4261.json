Twice a day is sufficient. \n\nSource: have Invisalign", "I have Invisalign too and have been across 3 different orthos.. all the same advice to brush at least lightly after every meal and snack because food and more specifically sugar will sit directly on your teeth for hours. I\u2019m glad your ortho gave you different advice but it\u2019s clearly not the only advice out there. Also this is not the point. The point is it\u2019s super normal to brush your teeth after meals even IF it\u2019s not good for your teeth, it still is very common for people to do and therefore not an A-hole thing to do! :)", "It\u2019s a sink.
