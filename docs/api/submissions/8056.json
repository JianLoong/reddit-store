Inside this one room is where my PC setup is and right next to it around the corner is my roommates cat litter. (Due to the way the apartment is built, this is the only place in the living room that the litter can go due to where all the doors are). Now my roommate goes to bed early and for the last couple of days the apartment has been smelling like cat shit since the aroma from his litter lingers until she empties it and since I can\u2019t stand having to smell poo I use a spray that has a bunch of chemicals that can be toxic to cats and my roommate has asked me not to use it. Recently her cat seems to be sick and she says that it could be from me using the room spray and that if it is, I will have to pay for her cats medical bills. I explained to my roommate that I would try to only use the spray around my desk and I would also open the windows to reduce the chance of the cat inhaling the spray.

How do you type a title like that and NOT realize YTA?\n\nYou live with an animal. You agreed to living with an animal. Animals stink sometimes. Just like you. I have always had cats and yes, it stinks for a while right after they poop but the smell always goes away as the litter material does its job. \n\nYOUR bathroom smells like shit after you take a dump.

A litterbox cabinet. \n2. A hepa and uv air filter\n3. An automated self-cleaning box like littermaid. \n\nUse vinegar for cleaning.

Amazing.\nIt doesn't matter that it's not your cat. You're bothered by the smell and the cat can't clean up after itself. Roommate is asleep. I'm assuming they clean up when they are aweake. But when they are not available, doesn't matter if it's because they're asleep, working, in hospital etc., they simply can't do it. So if you agreed to live with a cat, it should've been absolutely obvious that they will not sync their bowels with their owner's availability. \nThis is an incredibly ridiculous scenario and should not even be a thing among adults. \nI had a whole series of roommates during uni.

Only thing is, if it has a door remove it as a lot of cats struggle with them. It helps with the smell. \n\nAlso baking soda being added into the litter can help and it's not dangerous for the cat.

Roommate should keep litter box in her bedroom and it shouldn't be anywhere near your desk, even if roommate has to move her stuff around. Its so rude to expect someone to work around the smell of your cat's bowel movements.

That alone is disgusting.", "ESH, you slightly more than your room mate. The kitty litter should be in her room and not in a central living are....especially close to the kitchen. I'd be telling her that the box goes in her room from now on and you need to stop using toxic chemicals around the cat. I dislike cats immensely but would never poison them.

You roommate isn't being negligent or lazy, your roommate is asleep and I am guess when they are awake they are emptying the tray.\n\nSo even if it's not your cat, if it bothers you so much empty it yourself. Your roommate is asleep not neglecting their chores. Don't poison the cat because are you are stubborn. You agreed to the cat being bought in, you can't be so clueless as to think there wouldn't be some changes and sacrifices in doing so.\n\nAnd yes I emptied litter trays for my roomates cat when she couldn't (she was asleep, at work, out etc), because I'm an adult and I realized it took a few seconds to do and caused very little inconvenience but it made my environment better.", "YTA as others have stated.\n\nHonestly,  the best thing to do is just scoop the poo. No, it's not your job, not your cat etc, but the smell will dissipate fast if you do.

I get that you think that the only space for the litter box is where it is, but I promise that\u2019s not true. Figure something out. Buy a cabinet. Do something to change the situation!!", "Its worse that the kitchen and living room are made as one room so its literally in the same room as the kitchen. I would never be able to eat.", "So now that you know its making her sick, you will stop using it right?", "Your roommate can't be home and awake every minute you're home and awake. If she's available, ask her to scoop it. If she's not, scoop it yourself. And stop poisoning her cat.", "So you're trying to kill the cat instead? Eucalyptus is not a nice smelling harmless thing for cats, it's toxic.", "We have 3 cats and use wood litter. I\u2019ve found the litter itself makes an enormous difference to smell. Our usual brand (which is regular price) does a great job. There\u2019s been occasions when our usual isn\u2019t in stock so I\u2019ve bought a different brand. And it stinks within days. But then other brands have been fine. So tell her to try a different brand, see if that makes a difference", "They make litter mats and even litter boxes that greatly help reduce tracking.", "I use a walnut shell litter and pair it with a scented baking soda powder that's specifically for litter boxes. I think it's arm and hammer brand and you can get it at most pet stores. That along with a litter box with a lid that has a charcoal filter really helps.\n\nIs there a reason you're roommate can't keep the litter box in their bathroom? Then it will at least be far enough away from you that you can handle the smell until  your roommate can clean it.", "Most litter mats aren\u2019t big enough to catch the litter when the cat kicks it out of the box.  They can kick it out when they cover up their job.   I use those vinyl mats that go under office chairs for litter box mats for two of my litter boxes.  Your roommate will still be sweeping loose cat litter, but at least it will be a little more contained due to the size of the vinyl mat.  \n\nIt\u2019s probably not the poop that makes the litter box stink near as bad as the urine does.  Cat urine contains ammonia.  A more absorbent litter plus adding baking soda to the litter should help with the odor until one of you can scoop it out.\n\nThere are so many household products we humans use that are toxic to cats and dogs.  If you knew the air freshener you used was toxic to cats but used it anyway, YTA.  If you didn\u2019t know the air freshener was toxic to cats, NTA.", "Have you or your roommate looked into an air purifier? I have multiple cats and multiple air purifiers, near each litter box. One litter box in my bedroom, another a hall outside a bedroom and bathroom, and the third next to my desk. All are covered boxes but one. When the cats make a stink, the air purifier kicks on. Helps with the dust and smells.", "I just got here and I think I got the gist of what's happening.\n\nYou didn't know the spray was harmful so you're going to look at sprays that are safe to cats. I even saw someone to suggest to your roommate to look at better cat litter that clumps and smells nicer.\n\nGreat. You know you did something wrong and you're going to fix it.\n\nHere's my question. Why are you still here? You posted this like 5 hours ago. You just keep repeating yourself over and over. Are you that bored? Just go and fix the problem.", "Sorta, It doesn't waft as much. Also it's easier to clean up in the bathroom then on carpet or in high foot traffic areas. We keep our litter box in the bathroom.", "Wtf do you mean \u201cnot where he is\u201d the cat presumably moves around the entire apartment??? There is no place where the cat would magically not be??????? Especially when your desk is literally next to the litter box????? If you don\u2019t want to ever ever ever smell the cat box, move ALL of YOUR OWN stuff into YOUR OWN ROOM and close the door so the cat can\u2019t get in. Poison two feet away in open air is still poison in the air the cat is fucking breathing. Air moves. It circulates. If you can smell the cat shit the cat can smell whatever you\u2019re using to cover it up. I refuse to believe anyone could be this fucking clueless", "Yeah my cats litterbox is in the bathroom, I don\u2019t understand why more people don\u2019t do this.", "Good info. Mine doesn't seem to mind. Maybe a little test near his desk and see? Keep away from the box.", "So he doesn't have to sit in the smell of cat shit while his roommate is sleeping.", "Or why isn\u2019t the litter box in the owners room?", "People do it but the humid environment doesn't work well with some clumping litter and can make the order worse", "This! I also sweared by wood chips that turn into powder when they pee/ poop. Just get a litter tray with a cover for the dust.\n\nOr, the roommate could keep the litter tray in her bathroom? OP, YTA for using a product you know is toxic to the cat - are you trying to kill it?", "I thought crystal litter was dangerous for cats?", "What\u2019s the name of the product you use?", "Respectfully, YOU don't notice the smell. Everyone who comes into your house does.", "I hate these claims.\nOf course it smells  you are just used to it.", "We find wood pellets really good with the smell. Much better than other types of litter! And better for the environment.", "Oh man I wish I could use the crystals. My cat decided he will ONLY use tidy cats and will literally go right outside the litter box if it is anything else.", "I feel like you should get an outside opinion from someone who doesn't have cats. Litter boxes stink, even when you use expensive litter. Unless you clean it every day you're probably just used to the smell.", "I have this spray meant for smelly litter boxes that\u2019s cat and dog safe specifically", "Vicks highly recommends that people put their product on their chest and not under their nose but the rest of your comment stands", "OP shouldn't have to deal with the stink, at all.  They shouldn't have to find a solution to the odour - that's on the owner.", "Our automatic litter box was one of my cat's mortal enemy. He wouldn't use it but every time one of the other cats set it off he would come tearing through the house and attack it as it scooped.", "This.", "Maybe I've just never bought those kinds of products. I've asked our vet a few times in the past and they were fairly relaxed about it. Don't spray on the cat, near the cat, or heavily onto a surface the cat sleeps and cleans themselves on but otherwise probably ok was the response. Also if you're going to properly fumigate a room don't let the cat in while its hanging in the air.  I'm a cat owner and have been for a long time. I've had dogs in the past also but beyond those I've no experience with birds or other pets. And yes their sense of smell and taste is far superior to a humans but that does not immidiately equate to becoming unwell from an air freshner.", "It is unrealistic to expect the owner, who DOES scoop the litter every day, to be woken up in the middle of the night just because their cat took a shit. Like. The complaint OP has is that the owner goes to bed early and the cat takes a shit in the evening. That\u2019s not fair to the owner.", "Yeah if a pet owner is literally leaving shit in the apartment then they shouldn't own a pet. That's disgusting.", "OP mentioned doors, which might mean the roommate sleeps with the door shut and the cat free roams the rest of the house. So the litter box would be cut off from the cat at night.", "Just the smell alone would stop me from eating if its that bad but knowing that the tray is in the same room would have me eating out all the time.", "According to OPs comment, they expect their roommate to basically wake up from a nap/sleep when the cat poops at night. That\u2019s not a lazy pet owner that is shit expectations. \nThough I agree that different litter should be used. There are rugs for litterboxes that catch the litter that falls out. Would be an alternative", "yep, wood/pine pellet litter is great and eco-friendly as well. much less dusty than clay litter and fairly cheap.", "I think it depends on the brand and the cats themselves. Both my cats have had terrible reactions to Tidy Cat and similar brands. My oldest refuses to use wood chips/similar natural products. \n\nSo far, they've both been good with the crystal litter. No reactions, both are healthy, and they both use it. The brand my mom uses is similar. Her cat hasn't had any reactions and he's healthy. \n\nThat being said, I don't recommend Pretty Litter - which brought up crystal litter being used in my household. My sister discovered it on tik tok and honestly I don't trust any brand that's \"tik tok made me buy it\" crap.", "I use Pretty Kitty, I have 2 cats and it is the best litter I have found. The litter boxes are in my office. It work\u2019s fantastic.", "I want to know this too.", "It's called Ultra micro crystals.

It's like one bag a month for one cat before you need to change it - so it's cost effective too, imo", "Wanted to say that, it works perfectly and isnt even all that expensive", "if the stink only occurs when the cat poops after the roommate has gone to sleep for the night, and the roommate scoops the litter upon waking up, what are they supposed to do? Changing the litter and getting a box with a lid will probably help but even with my odor-absorbing litter and covered litter box it still smells immediately after my cat poops. The smell gets absorbed fast by the litter and doesn\u2019t linger if the box is scooped regularly but it sounds like OPs issue is with that immediate smell which is pretty unavoidable if you live with a cat.", "Mine too! He actually learned the timing and would always stroll into the room just before it went off. Then, attack! He actually broke it once or twice, though it was easily fixed each time. RIP Pete. Loved that guy.", "Is it unrealistic for the owner to realise the situation is uncomfortable for her room mate so investigates other alternatives, such as an enclosed box?  That's what a responsible cat owner would do.", "It can't be helped with cats, or animals that can't control their functions. I'm not gonna wake up at 3am to check to see if my cats have pooped and clean it up. Yes it's gross, but it's in the litter box and I'll deal with it in the morning, not a big deal. Often I'd come down in the morning to find my elderly dog had had an accident on the puppy pads I left down for her, and yes it was unpleasant, but it wasn't her fault. Are you saying i shouldn't own pets because I don't set an alarm to check my cats' litter boxes every couple of hours through the night?", "Doesn\u2019t seem like you care that much considering you\u2019re still defending the use of the toxic spray and complaining your roommate doesn\u2019t clean it immediately.

You care more about yourself.", "Don\u2019t pretend like you give a shit about that cat", "asleep does not equal available.  \n\nand unavailable does not equal free pass to use chemicals you know to be toxic/harmful to the cat.  \n\nand cat now being sick due to your decision to spray this toxic chemical DOES equal YTA.  \n\nyou should definitely pay for the vet bills to absolve yourself of this AH karma.  \n\nand in the scenario where the smell is bad and roommate is unavailable/asleep, just scoop the dang poop.. scoop it/flush it/it's gone.  at this point with a sick cat I don't care about your \"agreement\" it takes less than 2 minutes and is the most effective solution to the root problem", "You can get a litter box that vents out a window. You can move the box to her bedroom so she can better manage the shit smell. You can move the litter box to a bathroom (which has a fan and therefore can cope with shit smell) you can look for a different litter. You can use a different air freshener. You can move your desk to your own room and make it a cat free spray loving zone. I don\u2019t get why you would both sit there with your hands up like this is just how life has to be. \n\nThere is no proof that the cat is sick because of your spray, but there is proof that you aren\u2019t caring about the cat\u2019s health.

There\u2019s so many other options that are non toxic. Your roommate sucks for getting a cat with someone like you living there. Dr. Elseys kitty litter is the best period. $20 for a 40 lb. bag and it doesn\u2019t smell. There\u2019s no reason your roommate can\u2019t keep the litter box in her room or in the bathroom. Most cat owners clean out the box every day. Every other day. It\u2019s not normal to use wood chips etc, and it\u2019s unusual for it to smell up a house every time they poop unless you\u2019re just being dramatic. Not sure but that could be it too, you\u2019re overly dramatic and making the cat poop issue blown way out of proportion."]}
