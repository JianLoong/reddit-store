Inside this one room is where my PC setup is and right next to it around the corner is my roommates cat litter. (Due to the way the apartment is built, this is the only place in the living room that the litter can go due to where all the doors are). Now my roommate goes to bed early and for the last couple of days the apartment has been smelling like cat shit since the aroma from his litter lingers until she empties it and since I can\u2019t stand having to smell poo I use a spray that has a bunch of chemicals that can be toxic to cats and my roommate has asked me not to use it. Recently her cat seems to be sick and she says that it could be from me using the room spray and that if it is, I will have to pay for her cats medical bills. I explained to my roommate that I would try to only use the spray around my desk and I would also open the windows to reduce the chance of the cat inhaling the spray.

I get that it stinks and the litter should be cleaned. That's not justification for knowingly using something you know is harmful to the cat.", "YTA - it's kind of scary how callous you are being to the cat, who is an innocent living creature. I would take a long hard look at yourself.", "YTA, it seems like you knew it was a toxic spray and used it anyway. There are alternative sprays or fragrance options and you chose to risk the cats health anyway. Pay the medical bills if the cat is sick because of you.", "Holy shit, YTA. How do you type a title like that and NOT realize YTA?\n\nYou live with an animal. You agreed to living with an animal. Animals stink sometimes. Just like you. I have always had cats and yes, it stinks for a while right after they poop but the smell always goes away as the litter material does its job. \n\nYOUR bathroom smells like shit after you take a dump. Your roommate isn\u2019t knowingly poisoning you because of it.\n\nMaybe your roommate could look into a self-cleaning box, or even just a covered litter box to help with the smell.", "YTA. Why did you do it? You can ask him to clean the litter box again. And then ventilate the room well. But don't use the spray.", "YTA.

Wth dude, you're just straight up poisoning a cat. You're damn sure you're paying medical bills for the cat, your roommate could easily force the issue in a courtroom. Find a spray that doesn't kill cats. Not that hard mate.", "YTA- don\u2019t make the cat sick. \n\nThere are three things that make litter boxes in small spaces infinitely more tolerable:\n1. A litterbox cabinet. \n2. A hepa and uv air filter\n3. An automated self-cleaning box like littermaid. \n\nUse vinegar for cleaning.

Of course YTA. What I can't believe is how neither you nor even one commenter came to the ridiculously obvious solution: just pick the damn sh*t up! Clean the litter box. Your golden ring will not fall off your finger. How old are you, 5? You can't stand smelling sh*t but you'd rather swim in the smell for hours than spend 3 seconds scooping it out? Amazing.\nIt doesn't matter that it's not your cat. You're bothered by the smell and the cat can't clean up after itself. Roommate is asleep. I'm assuming they clean up when they are aweake. But when they are not available, doesn't matter if it's because they're asleep, working, in hospital etc., they simply can't do it. So if you agreed to live with a cat, it should've been absolutely obvious that they will not sync their bowels with their owner's availability. \nThis is an incredibly ridiculous scenario and should not even be a thing among adults. \nI had a whole series of roommates during uni. Some liked my cat, some not so much. But not one sat in the smell of her sh*t while I had classes or was simply out and they were home. They scooped up the sh*t, not for the cat, not for me, for their own comfort.\nGrow up.", "YTA. Smelling poo usually won't kill you,  but you are intentionally poisoning the cat.", "YTA.

It takes 60 seconds.", "ESH because this is avoidable. First tip: if the litter box doesn't have a hood, have your roommate look into one! It's super useful. Only thing is, if it has a door remove it as a lot of cats struggle with them. It helps with the smell. \n\nAlso baking soda being added into the litter can help and it's not dangerous for the cat. It helps with the smell though. \n\nShe should be scooping it once a day though. \n\nAnd you're an asshole for intentionally using something that could harm the cat.", "Does using chemicals I know to be toxic around a cat, who seems to impacted, make me a bad person.  Yes.  Yes it does.  YTA.", "OP. I'm honestly not sure how you can figure out which shoe goes on which foot in the morning.

Roommate should keep litter box in her bedroom and it shouldn't be anywhere near your desk, even if roommate has to move her stuff around. Its so rude to expect someone to work around the smell of your cat's bowel movements. And you suck for using a spray that isn't good for cats but let's be honest, most aerosol room spray is bad for everyone, not just cats. Split the vet bill. Then tell your roommate that she has to move her cat's litter box into her room. Litter boxes shouldn't be in the common area near the kitchen. That alone is disgusting.", "ESH, you slightly more than your room mate. The kitty litter should be in her room and not in a central living are....especially close to the kitchen. I'd be telling her that the box goes in her room from now on and you need to stop using toxic chemicals around the cat. I dislike cats immensely but would never poison them.

I get it smells, I have cats so trust me I get it, but we'll it's part of having indoor cats. You roommate isn't being negligent or lazy, your roommate is asleep and I am guess when they are awake they are emptying the tray.\n\nSo even if it's not your cat, if it bothers you so much empty it yourself. Your roommate is asleep not neglecting their chores. Don't poison the cat because are you are stubborn. You agreed to the cat being bought in, you can't be so clueless as to think there wouldn't be some changes and sacrifices in doing so.\n\nAnd yes I emptied litter trays for my roomates cat when she couldn't (she was asleep, at work, out etc), because I'm an adult and I realized it took a few seconds to do and caused very little inconvenience but it made my environment better.", "YTA as others have stated.\n\nHonestly,  the best thing to do is just scoop the poo. No, it's not your job, not your cat etc, but the smell will dissipate fast if you do. It only takes a minute, is far more effective than any spray, and will make the cat's life better, not worse (cat doesn't want to smell shit either).", "Yta. Jfc, lol.
