I think you missed a golden opportunity to educate your wife on the way home of her misconceptions. \n\nThat said, your sister and your mom need to accept that your sister\u2019s sobriety is the exception and not the norm just like mine is. The truth is that for an addict to make a single year of sobriety the chances are very slim. While I applaud your sister\u2019s sobriety, she should be cautious not to become self righteous about it because sobriety is very fragile and can be gone in an instant. \n\nTo be sure your wife\u2019s comments were wrong but you, your sister and mom\u2019s reaction was equally wrong.", "NTA.

My FIL stated something like that once when we were watching some news story on police carrying Naloxone, \"Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I think they should just let those addicts die. They're a drain on society.\"  His wife quietly reminded him that my sister has long term addiction issues (unlike OP's successful recovery, good for her) and he tried to pull his foot out of his mouth unsuccessfully. They both pretend that their daughter isn't a raging alcoholic and pill popper, but I guess those are civilized addictions...", "Honestly each situation with someone who is addicted to drugs or alcohol is different. I agree with both opinions there are some addicts who you help and they get clean for a bit then they are straight back at it and the cycle continues till the family stops helping and they either realize they need help and they get it themselves and get better or they keep going and die of an overdose. There are also people who like your sister wouldn\u2019t be here if they didn\u2019t have a family who wouldn\u2019t give up on them so I feel it\u2019s more on the particular circumstance and who the individual is.also if the said addict is truly wanting help or if they are just lying about wanting help to not lose their family or friends. \nIn regards to what your wife said it\u2019s an ignorant statement especially as your sister is right there. I don\u2019t know why she said it or why she thinks that but I think an honest and open conversation is needed with your wife because this is something important and maybe she\u2019s had experiences that maybe you don\u2019t know about that have effected her point of view maybe she\u2019s just ignorant and being rude. I can\u2019t say but she\u2019s needs to give you reasons. Personally I\u2019ve dealt with losing someone I knew because they overdosed. I\u2019ve seen people get better with the help of family and I\u2019ve seen it where until they lost theirs family they wouldn\u2019t get help. It depends on the specific individual some people respond to tough love and some who if given tough love it would push them further towards their vice whatever it may be. You are not an ass at all. I hope you figure this out with your wife no matter what the outcome is whether it means she realizes her fuck up and apologizes or if she doubles down and ends up destroying your marriage. The important thing is that your sister is doing well and hopefully your wife\u2019s ignorance doesn\u2019t get in her head and with parents like yours who kicked her out for what she said.

That might be a fatal move in my marriage unless there is quick remorse and sincere apologies (many).\n\nSister needs to be reinforced not to relapse, which is what your AH wife basically told would happen.\n\nGood luck pulling everyone together if you can.", "NTA\n\nMy goodness, relapses are common, that is true, but there are ways to be supportive and caring and your wife does not know those ways.\n\nShe had no business saying that, it's so discouraging when your sister should be supported and boosted up for doing something that is so so difficult to do (stay sober from opioids).", "God forbid you had kids with that woman and one of them had an addiction problem!", "NTA Was very insensitive and it was made worse when she doubled down.", "NTA. Funny how your wife is allowed to express an opinion which belittles someone but she thinks you can\u2019t.", " NTA and good for you for doing the right thing!", "Wow. Just wow. \nI hope you tell your sister that thousands of strangers on the internet are so exceedingly proud of her. She\u2019s not a junkie, nor has she ever been. She\u2019s a HUMAN BEING who struggled with substances. Yes she is more likely to relapse to her old behaviors during times of stress, just as non using folks are more likely to use their negative coping skills during times of stress. (smoking, alcohol, reckless sex, shopping, nail biting, skin picking, etc) That doesn\u2019t mean she will. It also doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a \u201cjunkie\u201d if she ever does relapse; she\u2019s still just a human being going through a hard time. \n\nI appreciate that you didn\u2019t side with your wife, but you\u2019re gently TA for not directly and bluntly disagreeing with her. Can you imagine how dehumanizing and hopeless that was for your sister to hear those comments? Do you realize she probably has those thoughts about herself, and has to actively work SO HARD to remind herself that she\u2019s not \u201cjust a junkie, and always will be\u201d? \nI love my brother to death, but if he was passive in a situation where his SO said something similar, that would massively damage our relationship. The silence says so much. \n\nOften times folks can\u2019t get clean even with the help of family because drug use is often from a systemic problem. Lack of safety, housing, connection, resources, etc. (The places that have the lowest rates of drug use have the highest amount of community resources for drug users. Drug users are not criminalized, they\u2019re helped, and harm reduction approaches are used.)", "op=NTA\n\nbut your wife was.\n\nShe may be entitled to her opinion(tho i'm over that whole \"opinion\" on entitlement).  But saying it in your Parent's home was rude.  \n\nDid she know your sister was an opioid addict?--if not then she should stopped after the first comment.  \n\nBut if she did know--then she should have kept her mouth shut rather than deliberately insult her SIL in her In-laws home.\n\nI'm for supporting your spouse, but not when they are wrong(and to the point of insult/abuse which I consider this to be).", "Dude how is this person your wife after she said something like that?", "NTA. But I have seen families destroyed financially because they throw every resource they have into trying to help their addicted child, and then, yes, it sometimes ends with the parents losing all their retirement money, the other siblings\u2019 college funds being spent on rehab after more expensive rehab, the parents being robbed repeatedly by their addicted child\u2026 and then the addict overdoses and dies. And your wife wasn\u2019t necessarily wrong about what can happen, or the possibility of relapse, but she definitely needs to learn to read the room. \n\nJust about every day in court you will see parents who finally just can\u2019t deal with what their addicted child is putting them through anymore, and they are prosecuting them for theft and having them legally banned from ever going back to their house. \n\nBut sometimes there are happy endings, and your wife should have apologized instantly and STFU, instead of digging herself deeper.", "NTA", "NTA \nHope she enjoys the divorce. She didn't even apologize", "A serious lack of empathy", "Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has them and most of them stink.", ">It\u2019s both comical and infuriating how people think they can say anything they want because it\u2019s their \u201copinion\u201d.\n\nOpinions are like assholes, everyone has one, but nobody wants to see it.", "I mean your ex mil son is not my sister. What happened in your situation doesn't mean will happen in our situation.", "No lol. The wife is an ignorant idiot to say that in front of the family. You say something needlessly offensive to people, and they don\u2019t want to be around you. That\u2019s just natural consequences", "Almost everyone has some sort of addiction. The wife wasn\u2019t arguing the semantics of addiction. She was arguing against the relevancy of recovery programs using the \u201caddict is always an addict\u201d line as justification. That take is ridiculous and your line of reasoning doesn\u2019t fit here.", "And your sister sounds like the exception to the rule (a lot of addicts relapse when things get tough)", "even AA success rate is pretty low", "Actually it\u2019s not wrong.     \nThey may be in recovery but they are always an addict.     \nYou can be an addict and not use.    \nThat\u2019s what they call in recovery.    \nI agree many don\u2019t go back to using but that doesn\u2019t mean they are no longer addicts.", "an addict is always an addict is factually wrong.\n\nNo, it's not.  An addict who is not using is a recovering addict.  I have an uncle who's been sober for 35 years, and he's still an addict. I have a shit ton of relatives who are addicts.  A great portion of them are recovering.", "I\u2019m not arguing against the relevance of recovery.     \nI am simply saying that what she said isn\u2019t wrong.   \nAddicts are always and will always be addicted to their drug of choice (alcohol, narcotics, gambling etc) .    \nBeing in recovery doesn\u2019t stop you being an addict.    \nMost do go back at least once many do multiple times.     \nAddiction is fine as long as you don\u2019t screw with anyone else\u2019s life when you\u2019re screwing your own.", "She maybe an exception, she maybe not . Future will tell. But what we don't need is telling her and my parents that their efforts are waste because she will relapse anyway in the future. That's literally the worse thing to say for a recovering addict who has been sober for 3  years from something as difficult as opioids.", "That\u2019s because the addiction never goes away.    \nThey can only keep trying to fight it.      \nMost aren\u2019t strong enough", "You\u2019re arguing about semantics. That is not relevant to this conversation.", "Not saying you are arguing against the relevance of recovery. But the wife is, which is why your take doesn\u2019t fit here.

She is at her In laws, with someone who she knows is a recovering addict, and telling them it\u2019s only a matter of time for a relapse and a probable OD.

Between addicted and addicted ?", "Addict is always an addict is just a popular saying from 1930s where neuroscience wasn't developed and they thought of addiction as a moral failure. You can still believe in this saying and you can also reject it. It is not like a medical fact that needs to be accepted. You can believe that they are always addicts and you can also believe that someone sober for 10 years is no longer an addict.  It is just a saying."]}
