I think you missed a golden opportunity to educate your wife on the way home of her misconceptions. \n\nThat said, your sister and your mom need to accept that your sister\u2019s sobriety is the exception and not the norm just like mine is. The truth is that for an addict to make a single year of sobriety the chances are very slim. While I applaud your sister\u2019s sobriety, she should be cautious not to become self righteous about it because sobriety is very fragile and can be gone in an instant. \n\nTo be sure your wife\u2019s comments were wrong but you, your sister and mom\u2019s reaction was equally wrong.", "NTA. Your wife is disgusting. I\u2019m waiting for the usual band of trolls to come by and start shouting you need to back your wife. Your wife is fully out of line.

My FIL stated something like that once when we were watching some news story on police carrying Naloxone, \"Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I think they should just let those addicts die. They're a drain on society.\"  His wife quietly reminded him that my sister has long term addiction issues (unlike OP's successful recovery, good for her) and he tried to pull his foot out of his mouth unsuccessfully. They both pretend that their daughter isn't a raging alcoholic and pill popper, but I guess those are civilized addictions...", "Honestly each situation with someone who is addicted to drugs or alcohol is different. I agree with both opinions there are some addicts who you help and they get clean for a bit then they are straight back at it and the cycle continues till the family stops helping and they either realize they need help and they get it themselves and get better or they keep going and die of an overdose. There are also people who like your sister wouldn\u2019t be here if they didn\u2019t have a family who wouldn\u2019t give up on them so I feel it\u2019s more on the particular circumstance and who the individual is.also if the said addict is truly wanting help or if they are just lying about wanting help to not lose their family or friends. \nIn regards to what your wife said it\u2019s an ignorant statement especially as your sister is right there. I don\u2019t know why she said it or why she thinks that but I think an honest and open conversation is needed with your wife because this is something important and maybe she\u2019s had experiences that maybe you don\u2019t know about that have effected her point of view maybe she\u2019s just ignorant and being rude. I can\u2019t say but she\u2019s needs to give you reasons. Personally I\u2019ve dealt with losing someone I knew because they overdosed. I\u2019ve seen people get better with the help of family and I\u2019ve seen it where until they lost theirs family they wouldn\u2019t get help. It depends on the specific individual some people respond to tough love and some who if given tough love it would push them further towards their vice whatever it may be. You are not an ass at all. I hope you figure this out with your wife no matter what the outcome is whether it means she realizes her fuck up and apologizes or if she doubles down and ends up destroying your marriage. The important thing is that your sister is doing well and hopefully your wife\u2019s ignorance doesn\u2019t get in her head and with parents like yours who kicked her out for what she said.

And nice to see you and your parents supporting your sister like this.", "NTA \n\nFile a divorce asap", "NTA\n\nYour wife is upset at being called out, she's trying to transfer that blame on to you by making it *not about what your parents said* but instead that you didn't have her back.  So now she's going to say she's mad that you didn't have her back to avoid being accountable for what she said.\n\nIt's a manipulation tactic designed to make you the bad guy and not her.  Don't apologize and don't let this redirection stand.\n\nConflict is something we naturally avoid, but I've found when it comes to manipulation tactics, redirecting of blame, etc, you have to nip it in the bud.\n\nI'd just tell her *'Look, I love you, I don't think you meant any harm with your comments, but I think you have less experience with situations like these and your views could evolve.  You don't have to agree but what you said was deeply painful to my sister'*.\n\nIf she still tries to push the *you let me down angle* then say *'I always support you as a person but I didn't agree with your opinion because I know in my sisters case I'm glad we never gave up on her.'*\n\nShe won't be happy about it because the accountability will still rest in her lap, but if you don't do this, your wife will rack up a string of wins in her head where you are always wrong and mean and she's always the victim, and let me tell you, just don't let that be the narrative.", "YTA - did your wife know this was a sensitive subject?  She is entitled to her opinion.", "Absolutely NTA - your family were just expressing their opinion of her opinion.", "Yeah, that was going to happen. She\u2019s not wrong, but there\u2019s a time and a place for those comments.", "Has to be. I've had a lot of alcoholics in my life, and as much as I've learned about the disease as an adult, I still have a hard time finding empathy or understanding for the kind of people who negatively affected my life for so long.\n\nEven so, I'd never *ever* blurt out something like that with other people present, especially people I don't know very well. OP's wife clearly hates addicts, and even doubled down instead of immediately becoming ashamed and apologizing when she learned there's an ex-addict in the room. Definitely doesn't excuse her behavior tho.", "Did your wife know about your sister's recovery before this? If so that's even nastier but even if she didn't, to double down after being called out was an AH move. Good luck to you OP, you may have just met your wife for the first time."]}
