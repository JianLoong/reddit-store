I know it\u2019s rare but there are times when this standard procedure can go astray. I have a group of friends(25m)(24m)(25f), some of which I\u2019ve known for a very long time, since grade school. I have to remind them constantly about stuff that\u2019s happening with me, which feels unfair as I remember every detail of their rants that they always repeat when they complain. Not that I mind hearing friends complain, but they don\u2019t really return the courtesy. Recently it just made me feel fed up having to remind them constantly about stuff happening with me. \n\nWell on Monday I texted one of them(25m) I was worried and they responded \u201cabout what?\u201d And I had to remind him I had a surgery coming up, not a big deal people forget stuff here and there. I tell them I have a surgery and they leave me on read, maybe they\u2019re busy. I leave for the hospital and go to surgery. Well the surgery goes wrong. I end up with a serious bleed afterwards and have to go to the ER after as I was quickly losing blood on my way home. I ended up swallowing nearly a pint of my own blood and have another emergency surgery the same day as my tonsillectomy to get my stomach pumped and throat recauterized. After I get sent home, I don\u2019t hear from my friends the next day. I don\u2019t hear from them the following day either except when two of them remind me to Snapchat them to keep our snap streak, never asking about the surgery or how I\u2019m doing. Basically the same thing happens again today where they only Snapchat me to keep a streak, not mentioning or asking at all about my surgery(ies). \n\nHonestly I\u2019m really hurt. One of these people I was the best maid at their wedding( it\u2019s the 2020s women can be best men lol ) and I was planning on having him as my brides man. Out of this group of friends, not one has reached out to me. I honestly could\u2019ve died, not to be dramatic but I really could have, and now I\u2019m seeing their response would be complete disinterest if they even bothered to find out. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to proceed. Do I even talk to them about this? Do I just cut them out? It\u2019s been four days and not one of them has called me or texted, aside from continuing a snap streak. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m about to start school this semester so maybe this would be a good time to just fade away from them? Not that they would even notice. AITA for ghosting them from here on out? Should I even make an attempt? I\u2019m high on all the pain meds and i feel really alone but I\u2019m not about to beg for attention from people I thought cared about me. \n\nTLDR:\nHad a surgery and an emergency surgery and not one friend reached out to check in on me after. It\u2019s been about a week.\n\nEdit\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m mentioning Snapchat is because it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve heard from any of them. They sent me a picture of their face, that\u2019s it. One time they sent me a pic of their face saying to respond so we don\u2019t lose our Snapstreak. I don\u2019t care about Snapchat. It\u2019s the only time I heard from them.\n\nEdit to my edit\n\nYes one of my friends in this group had surgery not too long ago which I helped out with before and after.

It really fucking sucks when you have that realisation that you care way more about a friendship than the other party/ies do. To be figuring this out when you're also trying to recover from a surgery where you had a major, life threatening complication is a lot to be dealing with all at once. Be kind to yourself by deleting these people from your Snapchat and wherever else you're in contact and looking towards your new start with your education. You are so, so right that you should not have to beg for attention from people that claim to care about you. When you find people that really do care, they don't need reminders or prompts to check in on your major life stuff. The time in between, when you let go of the not real friends and are trying to find the right people to have in your life, that can be awkward and a bit lonely sometimes.. and that's why things like Reddit are great.

A good example is 4 days ago, you were in the ER and they hadn't even reached out.\n\nDon't get caught up in the whole \"and this is what I do for you\" or \"you only asked about snapchat\" stuff.  It will only dilute your message - that their behavior hurts and here is an example.

Just because you\u2019re stewing about them not reading your mind and this warrants a discussion (though I know it\u2019s a tough situation because you can\u2019t really talk obviously and are probably on some pain meds and might not want to have even a text convo in that position.) \n\nBut I think that just a text saying \u201cim worried\u201d didn\u2019t tell them how worried you actually were. You say you understand people are busy that but it sounds like you haven\u2019t internalized that and are still kind of bitter. Which is fair but warrants a convo when you\u2019re feeling better. But I can understand that your surgery (which is pretty routine though obviously yours wasn\u2019t and that sucks) might be something they would need clarification on when you say you\u2019re worried.

Then watch how they will react. If they are apologetic and make more of an effort, then there\u2019s something to save there. If they act offended, won\u2019t accept how they made you feel, and won\u2019t even try to show their concern more, then move on. At least you know you did your part. Some people just aren\u2019t meant to stay in our lives forever. \n\nBut that\u2019s just how I would do it. Everyone\u2019s different.

I checked in on him during our weekly hang.\n\nAlso, reaching out when you need support is *not* the same thing as \"beg\\[ging\\] for attention\".  Human connection is important.  You can't always expect people to read your mind and know that something is wrong.

A couple of months later she got sick and afterwards told me how hurt she was i hadn't texted. We had a heart to heart, now she limits the amounts of texts when i'm sick and i make sure to check in once in a while so she feels appreciated. Also we just grew up a bit i guess :p.   \n\n\nBut yeah the friends probably don't realize the seriousness and her expectation to check in, as she says she has been bothered by thus before but it's clear it's not a one-sided friendship as she was bestmaid at one her friends weddings.", "It was for context!

And around 25 is when that dynamic starts to change because careers, marriages, and babies start happening. It doesn\u2019t make anyone a bad person, it\u2019s just life.

They don't see themselves as careless and hurtfl. They're *not* your true friends.\n\nI'll tell you my own experience. I'm disabled and was diagnosed at 16, by very nearly dying on my first flare up. I needed a major, oper heart surgery to even survive, used neck braces most of my senior year because I couldn't hold up my own head, needed random hospital trips for oxigen because I'd stop being able to breathe. I'm fine now but that year was *very* bad. \n\nI had friends I'd had since kindergarden, girls I'd thought would be my bffs for life. I know teens are fundamentally selfish on some levels, but we thought of each other as sisters, frequented each other's homes, I was there when one of them was sexually assaulted, was there through a rough divorce for the other's parents (cheating and abuse discovered), just was there for every good and bad moment.\n\nWhen I got sick, they dropped me. Never asked me how I was, never visited me at the hospital or after. Just stopped talking to me altogether, stopped *looking* in my direction. I didn't even understand why until in 2020 one of them reached out to apologise - after 15 years! They treated me like a leper because I suddenly couldn't *be there for them*. See, that was my role, my only role, to support them, be their shoulder, their rock. They'd never been interested in being mine. \n\nOP, maybe that's your role in your friend group too and you being the one needing help is so alien they're just ignoring it. Talk to them if you need closure for yourself, even keep a (lighter) relationship if you feel it's worth your while, but always remember they're not really your friends - they've proven that.\n\nI found true friends after that time, one even during that horrible time.

I'm sorry this happened to you.", "Why did you *need* these folks to check on you when you have a fianc\u00e9 and your own family who would\u2019ve been expected to be there for the surgery. \n\nBy not reminding them it\u2019s kind of like you were \u201ctesting\u201d them.\n\nI think no A H\u2019s here.  You\u2019re not wrong (but a little needy) and there not wrong (just busy with their own lives).\n\nIf this is something you need - move on.

They would be oblivious. \n\nNAH", "I have tried to convince people to be better friends by explaining that I am hurt gently. It is always a complete disaster and a total waste of time. By the time they are behaving like this they simply do not care. If you reach out to them they will still no care.\n\nTime to move on.", "To add to that; I'm sorry your experience was so scary and that you had no support from your so-called friends during it. To give you an idea of what you deserve: nowhere near as life-threatening, but I developed a chronic pain condition that turned out to be fibromyalgia a couple of years ago. During the months it took to get a diagnosis, my friends checked in constantly. Supportive messages, queries about my various appointments, reassurance - which I needed because I couldn't work and felt lazy and useless as well as in pain. They were there for me whenever I needed to talk about suddenly being disabled. A couple did research and sent small household items to let me function better, like a mandoline for chopping vegetables because doing so was hard for me and I love to cook.

I got flowers, was offered meals, and was texted/called\n\nFriends like OP's are no friends at all.", "OP has a fianc\u00e9. Maybe they thought OP was getting looked after by the fianc\u00e9.  Who knows? No one has actually spoken to these friends.", "Second this. My circle of friends is VERY different now than it was 10 years ago. Not all of it was malicious \u2014 people changing careers and moving 1,500 miles makes it hard to stay in touch with everyone. But there\u2019s a few I\u2019ve been able to hold on to, they\u2019ll be the lifers.", "Adding another voice to this reply. My friend circle is completely different now than ten years ago, let alone 30 years ago when I was OP\u2019s age. Some friendships ended dramatically, others just faded away, and yet others were somewhere in between. \n\nOP: it\u2019s ok to move on. These friends clearly have different priorities right now. Does that make them bad people? Maybe. Maybe not. But it doesn\u2019t particularly matter. What matters is that you aren\u2019t getting the friendship you deserve out of them and it\u2019s perfectly fine to move on. It doesn\u2019t need to be a big scene. Just drop the rope and quietly fade away if that\u2019s more comfortable for you.", "What do you mean there was no communication? OP told them multiple times she was having surgery. What is she supposed to do? Start dancing with disco lights with a giant letter also illuminated that reads\"I am having surgery\" for them to notice?", "Why are you spamming this post?", "You not a very good friend to anyone are you. Most people would at least send a text letting them know they were thinking about them and then ask them how it went. Anyone who doesn\u2019t is not a compassionate person", "Yeah I can\u2019t really eat so I\u2019ve just been hungry and emotional lol", "I just can\u2019t breathe when I lay on my back but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019ll go away when I\u2019m all healed up. If not I might be a little screwed lol", "But they still could've asked how it went.", "That's another matter, which is of no importance to the question whether it's high maintenance to remember a surgery", "This made me laugh thanks lol", "I think a lot of us have been in similar situations. I know I have. It took too long to realize that you can't make people care about you, no matter how you care about them. I was the support friend too. All it got me was pain and confusion. \n\nYou're not the problem here, from what I can tell. I have found personally, that it's not worth putting the energy into even reaching out to them about it. The lack of caring and communication on their part makes things very clear. They gave you an out whether they meant to or not. If it were me, I'd take it and let them go. Radio silence. If one of them reaches out when they need something, and they likely will, remember how they treated you, and leave them on read. You deserve to be treated with equal respect and caring, and they aren't the people you're going to get that from.", "Well, I hope you found a comfortable sleeping position in the meantime. \n\nHugs and stuff. Swift healing. This all sounds traumatic af.", "They could have, but they didn\u2019t.  Doesn\u2019t make them an A H in my mind.", "It absolutely makes them AH, to simply pick up the phone and ask someone how they are after a surgery let alone anything else is a really low bar.\n\nThe bar is buried in the ground.   \n\nIf asking a friend how they are ? After anything is considered high maintenance then they are selfish people.", "Yeah man, I had surgery and people I haven't spoken to for years reached out to me.", "Okay but not doing that and then reminding them of their Snapchat streak sucks", "I was in the hospital for a week and had my gallbladder out, my phone was constantly blowing up for the whole week with coworkers checking on me (even though I'm not super social and don't really talk to any of them outside of work.)\n\nChecking on a friend after they had surgery should be a bare minimum - it's not hard to shoot a FB message or a text and ask how it went/if they're OK."]}
