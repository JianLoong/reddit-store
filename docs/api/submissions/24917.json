I know it\u2019s rare but there are times when this standard procedure can go astray. I have a group of friends(25m)(24m)(25f), some of which I\u2019ve known for a very long time, since grade school. I have to remind them constantly about stuff that\u2019s happening with me, which feels unfair as I remember every detail of their rants that they always repeat when they complain. Not that I mind hearing friends complain, but they don\u2019t really return the courtesy. Recently it just made me feel fed up having to remind them constantly about stuff happening with me. \n\nWell on Monday I texted one of them(25m) I was worried and they responded \u201cabout what?\u201d And I had to remind him I had a surgery coming up, not a big deal people forget stuff here and there. I tell them I have a surgery and they leave me on read, maybe they\u2019re busy. I leave for the hospital and go to surgery. Well the surgery goes wrong. I end up with a serious bleed afterwards and have to go to the ER after as I was quickly losing blood on my way home. I ended up swallowing nearly a pint of my own blood and have another emergency surgery the same day as my tonsillectomy to get my stomach pumped and throat recauterized. After I get sent home, I don\u2019t hear from my friends the next day. I don\u2019t hear from them the following day either except when two of them remind me to Snapchat them to keep our snap streak, never asking about the surgery or how I\u2019m doing. Basically the same thing happens again today where they only Snapchat me to keep a streak, not mentioning or asking at all about my surgery(ies). \n\nHonestly I\u2019m really hurt. One of these people I was the best maid at their wedding( it\u2019s the 2020s women can be best men lol ) and I was planning on having him as my brides man. Out of this group of friends, not one has reached out to me. I honestly could\u2019ve died, not to be dramatic but I really could have, and now I\u2019m seeing their response would be complete disinterest if they even bothered to find out. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to proceed. Do I even talk to them about this? Do I just cut them out? It\u2019s been four days and not one of them has called me or texted, aside from continuing a snap streak. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m about to start school this semester so maybe this would be a good time to just fade away from them? Not that they would even notice. AITA for ghosting them from here on out? Should I even make an attempt? I\u2019m high on all the pain meds and i feel really alone but I\u2019m not about to beg for attention from people I thought cared about me. \n\nTLDR:\nHad a surgery and an emergency surgery and not one friend reached out to check in on me after. It\u2019s been about a week.\n\nEdit\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m mentioning Snapchat is because it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve heard from any of them. They sent me a picture of their face, that\u2019s it. One time they sent me a pic of their face saying to respond so we don\u2019t lose our Snapstreak. I don\u2019t care about Snapchat.

It really fucking sucks when you have that realisation that you care way more about a friendship than the other party/ies do.

Be kind to yourself by deleting these people from your Snapchat and wherever else you're in contact and looking towards your new start with your education. You are so, so right that you should not have to beg for attention from people that claim to care about you. When you find people that really do care, they don't need reminders or prompts to check in on your major life stuff. The time in between, when you let go of the not real friends and are trying to find the right people to have in your life, that can be awkward and a bit lonely sometimes.. and that's why things like Reddit are great.

A good example is 4 days ago, you were in the ER and they hadn't even reached out.\n\nDon't get caught up in the whole \"and this is what I do for you\" or \"you only asked about snapchat\" stuff.

Just because you\u2019re stewing about them not reading your mind and this warrants a discussion (though I know it\u2019s a tough situation because you can\u2019t really talk obviously and are probably on some pain meds and might not want to have even a text convo in that position.) \n\nBut I think that just a text saying \u201cim worried\u201d didn\u2019t tell them how worried you actually were. You say you understand people are busy that but it sounds like you haven\u2019t internalized that and are still kind of bitter. Which is fair but warrants a convo when you\u2019re feeling better. But I can understand that your surgery (which is pretty routine though obviously yours wasn\u2019t and that sucks) might be something they would need clarification on when you say you\u2019re worried.

Some people just aren\u2019t meant to stay in our lives forever. \n\nBut that\u2019s just how I would do it. Everyone\u2019s different.

Had you actually mentioned to any of them that you were anxious about the surgery?\n\nDid you downplay the severity of the surgery?\n\nIf you had not made it clear to them that this was a big deal to you (e.g. \"Oh, it's just a quick thing; I'll be out the same day.\"), they may not know that there was something to check in about.  A buddy of mine got a vasectomy; I knew the week it was happening, but not the day.  I checked in on him during our weekly hang.\n\nAlso, reaching out when you need support is *not* the same thing as \"beg\\[ging\\] for attention\".  Human connection is important.  You can't always expect people to read your mind and know that something is wrong.  Do your friends know that there were complications?  \n\nPick the one you were best maid for and just text something like: Hey, I've had some complications for my surgery, could you please drop off xxx for me? I'm having a tough time getting to the store.  (Or something.)", "Personally I would send them a group message saying how disappointed you are to realize you aren't a priority to them. Let them know you had the surgery and it went bad and you actually almost died and how not a single one of them has bothered to reach out to you to ask how it went. I would say I need some space and time away to rethink your friendships then leave the group chat and block them.", "NTA. TELL THEM. Gotta self advocate .then if they still remain uninterested AHs, dump them.", "[deleted]", "Jumping on top to say NAH.\n\nSo OPs friends are not as thoughtful as OP.  Okay.  It\u2019s not the end of the world.  They have got their own lives.  \n\nIf OP is more high maintenance then OP should get more high maintenance friends.  2 of those friends are dudes who would be lucky to remember their own mums birthdays.  \n\nIt also seems like OP was \u201ctesting\u201d them with whether they would remember.  Most AITA issues come from lack of communication.  Just tell them you had an operation and then they\u2019d ask.  Not everyone can keep track of what other ppl are doing.\n\nNAH.", "You can be petty, and once you're feeling, put a post up on SM that you're doing better and thank those that helped.", "Wait till you're off the meds, but there's no reason to devote yourself to people who can't even be bothered to ask how you're doing after surgery.", "Wow, if anything that means I should really decide who i should invest my time in. People who care about me, my fianc\u00e9 and my immediate family. Thank you.", "I feel like I could have written this. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it as well.", "Thanks! You\u2019ve said more than they have combined lol", "yeah i think it's worth it for OP to have a conversation, maybe the friends just didn't realize it was such a big deal. But also sometimes people have different friend expectations: i wouldn't expect my friend to text me when i am sick, in fact when a friend did do that i was very short and thinking stop bothering me when i have the flu. A couple of months later she got sick and afterwards told me how hurt she was i hadn't texted. We had a heart to heart, now she limits the amounts of texts when i'm sick and i make sure to check in once in a while so she feels appreciated. Also we just grew up a bit i guess :p.   \n\n\nBut yeah the friends probably don't realize the seriousness and her expectation to check in, as she says she has been bothered by thus before but it's clear it's not a one-sided friendship as she was bestmaid at one her friends weddings.", "It was for context! I don\u2019t care about Snapchat that\u2019s just the only time I heard from them", "I have my man and my sisters and father. I\u2019m more grateful for them right now", "I\u2019m all of those things\u2026", "I really can\u2019t talk at all. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to talk for two weeks at least. Which makes me feel weird because they really haven\u2019t heard from me at all and they haven\u2019t reached out. To them I just vanished and I still see them hanging out on discord and posting memes, not a care that I\u2019ve been gone this whole time.", "I actually disagree, not the AH part; OP is definitely NTA. But I don't think they should get all that effort. OP, if they are going to let you just keep fading away, especially right after surgery. Or if they don't reach out even after you break your streaks... those are pretty clear answers right there - they'd be showing you they aren't worth your time or your emotional, *or* physical effort.", "Woke up because the pain meds wore off. No when he had surgery I was checking in on him constantly leading up to and after the surgery. He doesn\u2019t check in on me. He doesn\u2019t care.", "I did.

I know it can be hard in this day and age to make friends.  Real friends.\n\nI recommend to looking to friends in your hobbies.  Because you know you would have common ground and something in common to talk about.", "It's high maintenance to remember a surgery? Hmmm", "I don\u2019t want you to think everyone is like this, it\u2019s just my experience. But when people grow up, friendships change, essentially people change. You\u2019re going to want to keep the relationships with people who rally around you when shit goes south in your life, not just when it\u2019s time to party. And around 25 is when that dynamic starts to change because careers, marriages, and babies start happening. It doesn\u2019t make anyone a bad person, it\u2019s just life. The people that want to be in your life will make an effort to stay in it.", "So. I just wanna stress not everyone is like this - it *is* possible to find friends who care! - but people who are capable of ignoring you through surgeries or significant dangerous moments *will not change*. They don't see themselves as careless and hurtfl. They're *not* your true friends.\n\nI'll tell you my own experience. I'm disabled and was diagnosed at 16, by very nearly dying on my first flare up. I needed a major, oper heart surgery to even survive, used neck braces most of my senior year because I couldn't hold up my own head, needed random hospital trips for oxigen because I'd stop being able to breathe. I'm fine now but that year was *very* bad. \n\nI had friends I'd had since kindergarden, girls I'd thought would be my bffs for life. I know teens are fundamentally selfish on some levels, but we thought of each other as sisters, frequented each other's homes, I was there when one of them was sexually assaulted, was there through a rough divorce for the other's parents (cheating and abuse discovered), just was there for every good and bad moment.\n\nWhen I got sick, they dropped me. Never asked me how I was, never visited me at the hospital or after. Just stopped talking to me altogether, stopped *looking* in my direction. I didn't even understand why until in 2020 one of them reached out to apologise - after 15 years! They treated me like a leper because I suddenly couldn't *be there for them*. See, that was my role, my only role, to support them, be their shoulder, their rock. They'd never been interested in being mine. \n\nOP, maybe that's your role in your friend group too and you being the one needing help is so alien they're just ignoring it. Talk to them if you need closure for yourself, even keep a (lighter) relationship if you feel it's worth your while, but always remember they're not really your friends - they've proven that.\n\nI found true friends after that time, one even during that horrible time. So will you! But you have to get rid of the deadweight first. I'm sorry this happened to you.", "Why did you *need* these folks to check on you when you have a fianc\u00e9 and your own family who would\u2019ve been expected to be there for the surgery. \n\nBy not reminding them it\u2019s kind of like you were \u201ctesting\u201d them.\n\nI think no A H\u2019s here.  You\u2019re not wrong (but a little needy) and there not wrong (just busy with their own lives).\n\nIf this is something you need - move on.  But communication is the key and there was no communication from you to them of what you wanted from them.  They would be oblivious. \n\nNAH", "I have tried to convince people to be better friends by explaining that I am hurt gently. It is always a complete disaster and a total waste of time. By the time they are behaving like this they simply do not care. If you reach out to them they will still no care.\n\nTime to move on.", "To add to that; I'm sorry your experience was so scary and that you had no support from your so-called friends during it. To give you an idea of what you deserve: nowhere near as life-threatening, but I developed a chronic pain condition that turned out to be fibromyalgia a couple of years ago. During the months it took to get a diagnosis, my friends checked in constantly. Supportive messages, queries about my various appointments, reassurance - which I needed because I couldn't work and felt lazy and useless as well as in pain. They were there for me whenever I needed to talk about suddenly being disabled. A couple did research and sent small household items to let me function better, like a mandoline for chopping vegetables because doing so was hard for me and I love to cook. If your friends aren't there for you at your worst, they don't deserve you at your best. NTA.", "Oh it\u2019s not a dig at you don\u2019t worry lol, its at them for such a childish thing being their priority over your health", "It's an AA thing, but I use it a lot if I feel myself getting upset about anything. Like wait, is this real or is my brain tricking me?", "Sad to say, but there's your answer right there.", "I probably would agree 100% with you on the \"not worth the effort\" part if not for two things:\n\nThey are still younger, and therefore may not really have developed that sense of normalcy that comes with long term friendships.  Plus for a lot of younger people,  social media interaction IS the friendly thing.  Better to give it the 'ol college try as they used to say\n\nSecond,  she seems really bummed out by the idea.   The coulda-shoulda-woulda may cause more distress than just going through the effort for a definitive answer.", "They\u2019re not friends, they\u2019re acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your surgery didn\u2019t go smoothly, this experience had to have been very terrifying! Hopefully recovery goes smoothly and you are able to heal not only physically but mentally and emotionally. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that it takes something like this for people to show their true colors. Friendship is like paper, it will never be the same once crumpled.", "You are a very wise heavy metal mommy. Thank you for the insight", "That honestly makes a lot of sense. I\u2019ve been the one they come to for all their issues but suddenly when I have a problem they\u2019re nowhere to be seen.", "When my friend had surgery I helped them and called them before and after to check in on them without having to be reminded. They did no such thing in return. It wasn\u2019t that I was testing them, as I already told them beforehand it would happen. I told them the day before and the day of, still no reply.", "Ohhhh sorry I\u2019m having a hard time reading between the lines, oxy is crazy", "Oof. You\u2019re right. It doesn\u2019t even matter to them.", "That's fair. Do whatever feels right to you, OP and good luck!", "Haha! Just wanted you to know that your not alone in your feelings and why.
