One of them were couples and other were single.\n\nThey went out partied a lot, they rented a BNB there beachside and my wife skinny dipped with them\ud83e\udee5\ud83e\udee5. And on top of that she didn't even told me about skinny freaking dipping.\n\nShe told me all about parties, drinking, dancing. Last week one of her friend joined us on dinner and she casually mentioned the 'fun' they had while skinny dipping, how they played etc etc. And I was shocked. I didn't talked to my wife for 2 days straight. Later she said I am overreacting and nothing \"Dirty\" happened there, she was drunk and it just happened. \n\nI asked her to stop seeing those 'male best friends', I am totally not ok with her spending any more time with them, My wife said that I am being old school and overreacting here. \n\nSee, I am a liberal but it's beyond my limits, my WIFE naked with other men? Nah, I can't deal with that. They might be her old besties and the other women might be ok with it, but my wife playing with other men without clothes? How can anyone be ok with that?\n\nAITA here? Or my wife is?\n\nPs. Its funny how people are justifying my wife's action literally! Wow. Few people telling me I have no right to tell my wife who she can hang out with? Like WTF\ud83e\udd23 I Am asking my OWN WIFE not to go out with other MEN who goes NAKED with her? And I am wrong here? The audacity of some people here is off the roof.

People who get so drunk that \"things just happen\"  all ways mess up and never take accountability for there actions, its a big red flag.

MAJOR RED FLAG. also if the roles were reversed she would be all on your ass about how you\u2019re not respecting her and cheating lol. If it were me\u2026 not that you asked. I believe I would have to leave her if she won\u2019t stop. You already forgave her by still being with her and asking her to stop when others would\u2019ve just left right when they found out she was NAKED with other men around.

Every couple is different, so there need to be ground rules to make sure both people are on the same page. Maybe you can hang out with her and her friends and get to know them better? I do find it odd that they\u2019re not including you. I can understand the girls wanting to have \u201cladies night\u201d, but once the guys got involved, they should have invited you out of respect. Personally I would never spend a weekend away from my husband where there were other men.

The fact she didn\u2019t seems odd. Although I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have done it sober and it may not inherently have been sexual, she should\u2019ve said something. It makes sense you would be upset not just with her actions but with her concealment of them", "NTA.  You and your wife get to set your boundaries.

It falls more under \"extremely dumb drunk stuff\" and although I'm certainly not a fan of it, it isn't equatable to cheating or sexual desire.\n\nBut everyone has things they are and are not comfortable with and if this is a line in the sand for you I support it.", "I'm not married so take what I say with a grain of salt, but  it is going to be pretty much the same as most people here. Her skinny dipping in itself may not inherently be in ill intent, but the very fact that she abstained from telling you shows that she knew you may not have been ok with it. If she casually mentioned it knowing you were in the room. Sure maybe this was her way of disclosing it to you without confronting the issue, but it seems more likely she was gaslighting you into thinking it wasn't a problem, and some part of her was aware that it probably was. What's more, she doesn't seem to be apologetic for you feeling uncomfortable about this happening.\n\nIf you were to ask me for my two cents, it would be to approach this from emphasizing the fact that she is dismissing your boundaries. I say this because if you were to question why she didn't tell you earlier, she'd easily say \"I didn't think it was a bit deal.\" Thats her story, and theres not much you can do with that. However what's important is that now she *knows* it's a big deal to you, and yet she still is dismissive about it. Voice to her that you do not feel like she is respecting your boundaries, and this is impactful to your trust in her.\nGood luck.", "yta", "I don't let my husband dictate who I can be friends with but I've never gotten naked with my male friends. She crossed a line.", "I fear things are going to get messy for you and the marriage bud...hopefully you're going to be ok but she's broken a trust between you both.

I'm sure somebody will say \"her body, her choice\", but screw that. That's wrong. If you're married you don't just go get drunk and wantonly strip with other people like that.\n\nIt may be noted that getting married gets rid of \"I can do whatever I want because it's my life and my body!\" You swear certain oaths when you get married involving fidelity. And finding out that your wife went a'stripping with other dudes is pretty damn close to finding out about infidelity. Or rather, a form of infidelity (after all, we have invented the term \"emotional cheating\" and treated it like a form of infidelity)\n\nI'd be wondering what else she has hidden from me.\n\n(And people saying nudity isn't sexual? Please. Maybe nudity isn't sexual but *human beings are*. You bet your asses the dudes were checking her out, and not in a \"why, I'm just admiring the human body in an abstract meta sense!\" way.).", "NTA.  What freaking country or culture it is has zero meaning here (I'm not sure what that other commenter is thinking).  Zero.  It was totally inappropriate and she HID IT FROM HIM.  If it weren't a big deal why hide it?  Unless OP plans on having an open relationship, this behavior is BS.  You are two years into this marriage.  If she sees no problem with this it might be time to be looking for an exit plan.  Given this situation it's not necessarily time to pull the plug, but if she can't come around to why this isn't acceptable OP needs to be ready to cut his losses, even if he believes \"nothing \"Dirty\" happened there\".", "NTA I'm getting dizzy at how unreasonable some of these responses are. You, as her Husband, have made clear your boundaries on the subject, so she, as your wife, should be taking it seriously too, or talking it out with you without plain brushing you off like you're the crazy one here.\n\nI think you will find that the majority of couples will have a thing or two to say about the idea of their partners being naked around people of the opposite sex, or just generally people they are not in a relationship with. It is understandably concerning and hurtful, especially when it is completely hidden and you are having to find out about it from someone else.\n\nIf the script was flipped and it was a man prancing around naked with other women, I bet you these people would have tons to say, so honestly I wouldn't even really take them seriously, because they're living in a biased fantasy world.\n\nThe truth is, you don't even really know what went down. You're **trusting** that your wife only skinny dipped with these naked men, and nothing else...but honestly, the way she's behaving about it is questionable at most. Hard NTA. This is an obvious and rather simple boundary that I would expect most serious couples to be square about, and the fact that people are trying to defend the wife is ridiculous.", "ESH, the tension point is poor communication on both parts.\nShe\u2019s didn\u2019t tell you and that speaks volumes. \nIt also speaks volumes that she was given the silent treatment for 2 days straight once the truth came out. Boundaries are crossed when expectations aren\u2019t spoken and/or inferred. Creating a space to openly speak about boundaries and allow room for understanding our mistakes is key. It can be paralleled to fear a kid has with a strict parent. The dynamics are of course different but concept of omitting truths out of fear of reprimand is still there.

WTF? Stop being delusional, we don't walk around naked. As a French woman - not a prude either - what OP's wife did really cannot be justified by a \"cultural diff\u00e9rence\".", "NTA\u2026everyone wants liberal beliefs until they\u2019re in an exclusive monogamous relationship lol You have every right to set that boundary and expect your wife to respect it\u2026if she doesn\u2019t\u2026then that tells you all you need to know about her.

It's just a difference in culture and upbringing / values. I'm definitely more like your wife, and would see nothing wrong or inherently sexual about going skinny dipping, and my motivations would be simply to enjoy myself with my friends. No ill intent. But I understand that not everyone shares those same feelings. There's a big difference between discussing your level of comfort and requesting she not do these types of activities, and demanding she stops this behaviour. It's likely that the two of you simply don't see eye to eye on this type of thing, but that doesn't make one right and one wrong.

You need to discuss with her what your boundaries are.", "NAH. It seems like you're both very different people.

That's what women and some men don't even understand. I used to think I wanted to be loved til I woke up. I want to be respected by my woman, it shows love at the same time, they go hand in hand. I don't need to hear I love you 10 times a day if her actions say it for her. Your wife wasn't respecting herself or your relationship by going skinny dipping with other men. It's so easy to say it was all innocent. She's not a 17 year old kid is she? I'm sure you love her but if she can't even see that there's a problem, she's been sold the feminist lie like so many females and believes she's entitled to do anything because it's her life. Problem is its both your relationships and happiness on the line, not just hers. If it was a man doing this he'd get torched in the comments. I thought women want equality, well here it is. If she can't understand your concern you either a. Put up with it and let her do her. B. Do similar back to her in a childish game to prove a point and hurt you both even further. C.

Nudity doesn't equate to sex for me, just comfort, and I see no problem with people of the opposite sex skinny dipping together in appropriate venues. My friends and I even have a tradition that we skinny dip together in every new (to us) ocean area we swim in. However, I also know that this is not everyone's view, and you clearly don't agree. Your wife should have known this and respected you enough to either not go skinny dipping in the first place (ideal) or, if it was just a spur of the moment drunken decision, let you know about it right away and apologize instead of hiding it and hoping you wouldn't find out. \n\nIt is understandable you are not comfortable with those male friends, and it was completely reasonable for you to ask your wife to avoid spending time with those men alone, but you also need to be prepared if she decides she doesn't want to live with that restriction. \n\nYou two definitely need to communicate and get on the same page about this issue if you want to continue the marriage. There are many issues that a couple could have differing views on and still have a happy marriage. I doubt this is one of them.", "NTA. She didn't tell you about it because she knew you would be upset about it. Which is pretty manipulative. I don't think it's a big deal to be someone in a committed relationship and have casual skinny dipping fun. It becomes a big deal when that is out of the range of your partner's comfortablity.

If you wanna say \"her body her choice,\" I mean that's fine, but to say, \"It's fine for her to lie and hide it while dismissing your feelings about it\" is a little much.

Instead the church pretended it was my paranoia and she used that to cheat twice and still does not believe she did anything wrong. During this time I was gas lit with lies and I couldn't tell the difference between lies and the truth... This part hurt the most. Not being able to see and nothing making sense.\n\n\nOf course it ended with a divorce. \n\nBut your mental health is important, the sacrifice of your love for your mentality might be the best decision you make.\n\nI think, had she told you in advance and invited you in, then it's a different story.\n\nAlso there are women out there where their husbands have done the same thing and they feel powerless like yourself in your situation. You'd do well matching up with people that share the same values", "There exists this mentality that you can do whatever you want without consequences. That is simply a delusion. The wife is more than welcome to go back to the glory days of getting railed by random guys. The consequence is that she will be single. She has the power to decide HER actions. She can not dictact the consequences of said actions. You can drink til near black out and then drive. You well then suffer the consequence of that action. This is basic common sense stuff for normal decent people. When someone tells you \"I am not ok with this\" you have two choices. Keep doing it and face the consequence or respect what you were told and stop. Again common sense for a decent person. It is not rocket science here.", "Physically stopping her would be enforcing it, hence the word \u201cforce\u201d in enforce, with force, by force", "I'm pretty sure the point is that she is CHOOSING to be an absolute shitty partner that will have the consequence of him leaving and not putting up with it. \n\nFraming it as he TOLD her what to do and she defiantly resisted being controlled makes him sound like the bad guy and allows for some grey area that could shift blame on him for her choices.\n\nAs a teacher, learning how to frame things to show that each person is responsible for their own actions instead of me being a mean authority figure felt like I learned a cheat code or something.\n\nSlapped 5 vague rules (Respect others, respect yourself, Make progress, and clean up.) on the wall, told the kids everyone in the room including myself had to follow them equally. Then made some very clear consequences for breaking each rule. Took all the guesswork out of it. \n\nKinda hard for a middle schooler to feel around in the dark for the imaginary boundaries they want to push when there's a big ass immovable boundary that neither they nor I can control right on the wall.\n\nSuddenly I was never \"that mean teacher that made me stop talking to my friends and engage int he lesson\" anymore. They broke a rule and all I had to do was ask them if their action met the rule. They knew that CHOOSING to not follow the rules led to the very clearly laid out consequences.", "OP ignore these people. Cultural or not there are some boundaries in relationships that should not be crossed. Your wife knew she was breaking boundaries as evidence by her not telling you and gaslighting you. If she was keeping her skinny dipping with other men from you, theres no telling to what she could also be keeping from you. The fact you found out from a 3rd party says enough\u2026 if she hasn\u2019t done anything more yet she probably will soon. I would wonder how close she was to her \u201ccollege male best friends\u201d too.", "Ok thanks for clarifying. Sorry, my mind is just too fucked from the amount of frankly braindead invented justifications I see that always validate any negative action a woman takes.", "What you said there is a reason there needs to be boundaries. Otherwise, you get shit shows like this. \n\nThis is the stuff that needs to be worked out. If you can't be exclusive in marriage, don't get married. In a marriage, you both are supposed to walk together as one organism sharing your lives together.", "What exactly are the qualities of a \"decent woman\"? I'm at the edge of my seat...", "Enforce-compel observance or compliance with a rule, law or agreement. \n\nEnforce has nothing to do with actual force. It can be done via force but it can also be done via appropriate consequences(if you see the dudes we are done.)", "What you call \u201cdictating her behaviour\u201d  is the same thing as setting boundaries. Ofcourse she is free to leave if these boundaries are unacceptable to her. He knows this and thats why he is looking for validation that  the boundary he is setting is a reasonable one. In a relationship both parties Do dictate each others behaviour to a degree within the context of the relationship. On the spectrum of \u201cif you cheat on me, its over \u201d to \u201cif you talk with your friends its over\u201d these are still both merely boundaries.  So is a man justified in telling his wife what(not) to do? Yes he is. Just as a woman is justified in setting redlines  with her partner and telling then what they cant do. And the other party is free to decide whether or not their partners requests / boundaries are reasonable. Whether they fall into the category of Normal boundaries that most people have, or whether they fall into the category of unreasonable and controlling.", "So the issue I see is that MOST people aren't in a type of relationship where what's considered cheating, especially actions along the lines of what she's done, is a gray area. Most monogamous people would view their SO getting naked and fooling around with someone else as cheating. I understand that this is not 100% the case 100% of the time. So I don't see how it falls on him to tell her that getting naked with other men constitutes cheating. Especially if an open relationship or some kind of ethical non-monogomy had never been brought up. Maybe it has, but it doesn't sound like it.\n\nIs it wrong to say, \"I absolutely forbid you to see those guys again?\" I would say sure, it's a little overbearing. However, him taking a couple of days to think it over does not make him an asshole. I don't know many people who could say, \"I found out my wife gets naked with other men and very politely told her that I needed some time to think.\" He was hurt, and he took a couple of days to himself, and that's okay. She doesn't owe him anything, right? But neither does he.", "No he isnt asking that. He is asking if he is being old school and overreacting like his wife asserts, or if he is justified in asserting the boundary of dont be naked around other men. Hes asking if thats a normal reaction, or if by setting that boundary he is being \u201ccontrolling\u201d He had the conversation when he felt like he was ready to have the conversation.    While i agree its not okay to mope around and give someone the silent treatment and leave them wondering whats wrong but thats not what happened here and it is okay for someone to tell someone I dont want to talk to you right now. I have to process this, emotions are too raw and im not ready to talk about it. and he got his thoughts together to talk about it in a couple days. I dont think his actions/reactions were wrong at all.", "You claim to not defend her while then trying to defend her. And yes OP does have the right to set boundries. We all have boundries we do not want others to cross. Him saying cross this line and I am done with you is perfectly reasonable. She can now decide to respect his boundry or cross it and face the consquences of her actions.", "It is too late, she broke his trust", "Exactly", "I mean, you and I aren't on very different pages. I agree. She is choosing to do something shitty. I'm only using the \"he TOLD her\" because that's what he said he did. He said he TOLD her she wasn't allowed to be around them anymore. Now, I see that as controlling because I've been in a situation where I had literally done nothing wrong, and an SO had been telling me who I was or wasn't allowed to be around. Both men and women. But if our view on what's controlling is different, then that's fine.\n\nI agree that he's not the problem, even if I don't care for the 'you aren't allowed to do this' and I agree the only person who's the AH is the (hopefully) soon to be ex.", "While you at that seat's edge I was curious, what do you think of a wife who goes naked with other men behind her husband back? \nThat's your answer and if you have trouble switch the roles.", "I would say a decent woman is one who respects her partner. Unlike the woman the OP is married to.\n\nI don't know if you're looking for a wikipedia length explanation as to what constitutes basic decency but it's out there somewhere if you want to find out.\n\nRespecting your wife/husband is pretty basic in terms of expectations in a relationship.", "Not really, because what if she just keeps being naked around other men? Then the rule is not being enforced. He can divorce her but he can\u2019t prevent her from breaking the rule.", "I think you're missing their point, possibly because they've framed their argument in a way that you took as defending the wife.\n\nIt's important to not dictate or \"tell\" a spouse what to do because that can be semantically construed as relieving them of being held responsible for their choices.\n\nIt's important to draw a boundary and give her the choice instead of framing it in a way that could shift blame onto him. Because, let's be honest, unless there's threats of force or punishment it's not dictating or controlling by definition.", "I think it's the way the argument was framed or phrased that triggered people before they could work through the implications of framing it as her choice vs his decree.", "Functionally they lead to the same outcome, semantically they are quite different. \n\nOne is him dictating without giving her the autonomy to choose, the other gives her the autonomy to be heinous or work on her marriage.\n\nIt seems pedantic, but it's crucial in how it frames what each person is being held responsible for. Acknowledging that she's choosing to leave him for the life she might want vs being forced into it is important.", "Maybe i'm too cynical but i feel like people prefer to see it black & white, good & evil.\n\nWhich can lead to misguided anger. Is it the act of skinnydipping he's angry at, or her omitting she did, or both?", "Also married. Being loyal is a pillar to a successful marriage. You do not need to communicate that getting naked around single members of the other gender is crossing the line. That is common sense. Otherwise why get married at all? Marriage is meaningless if you think its ok to step out because \"you did not communicate I should not\"."]}
