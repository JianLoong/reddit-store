I'm starting this off by saying I understand I have 0 control over how others live their life, and generally if it doesn't affect me or hurt others I don't really care. However, my brother's life is so effed up I just can't sit by and watch it anymore. \n\nHe's married. His wife has a live in girlfriend. Yep his wife is in a whole other relationship. At first I accepted it as a \"if he's happy then I'm happy\" kinda thing. But as time has gone on I've started to realize this entire thing isn't fair. He works 6 days a week, while they both sit at home doing fuck all. He's given up his dreams of where he wants to live, having kids, etc all to just please her. And i literally can't stand it anymore. He literally is ok with her having a girlfriend, letting this gf live with them, He's cool with them staying home but yet SHE has all these obnoxious rules for him. He can't be around any other female (even if they're family) he has to do what they say when they say it (do the dishes, get them food, cook dinner, etc) and to me it just seems so fucked up and manipulative. \n\nSo recently my husband & I moved into essentially our dream house. I told my brother that he & his wife are welcome, but the gf is not. I recognize the wife is apart of the family and I'm willing to be cordial for her, BUT her gf I don't need to have any respect or loyalty to. Well me saying this caused a shit storm. He's called me every name in the book, accused me of being homophobic (I'm 100% not. I'd feel the same way if her gf was a man instead) And didn't even give af to text me when my birthday passed, and even when I unexpectedly had to put my beloved dog down. \n\nI get it, family is family, but I refuse to allow someone in my life who treats me this way when all I simply asked for was a certain someone not to come to my house. I said I'd be cordial to them at other family events, & I not once said anything about any of them as individuals yet my sibling essentially attacked everything about me. Since then though I've felt isolated & separated by my the rest of my family.

Is he happy to accept those rules? Is it a dom/sub relationship going on between the three of them? (That sounds invasive, but it ties into the question about rules).\n\nYou're allowed to deny anyone you want from your home, but I'm going to reserve further judgement until I know more about if your brother is happy. If he is, then I see no reason why you should judge their polyamorous relationship.", "NTA because you don't have to have anyone in your house if you don't like them. \n\nBut stop pretending to be surprised that your brother is upset when you specifically set out to show him you disapprove of his choices. If you decide to start a fight dont be shocked when he doesn't text you about your dog.", "NTA, but you possibly made a mistake that could isolate your Brother more by not inviting the GF.\n\nIt sounds like your Brother is either a cuck in a BDSM relationship, which is fine. Or he\u2019s in a heavily abusive relationship with no autonomy or financial control. \n\nYou\u2019re fine to feel uncomfortable with that, but if it is an abusive relationship, not inviting the girlfriend has probably given these Women a great excuse to \u2018convince\u2019 him to cut you off/block you. If this is abusive then he\u2019s trapped worse than he was before. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about abuse, I would extend an olive branch to have the three of them over. It might make you uncomfortable, but if you\u2019re worried about him, it might be the best way to check he is okay. Expect that partners go through his phone/messaging if this is abuse. \n\nIf you think there\u2019s even the smallest chance of him being abused, I would suggest getting a male relative/in-law/friend that he is comfortable with to just gently ask if he is okay or if he needs help. If it is abuse he\u2019ll probably be able to open up to a guy a lot easier than another woman.", "NTA.\n\nYou decide who enters your home. There is a however though. The other person also gets to decide if they want to enter your home. \n\nYou put up a boundary. The consequence of that boundary is that your brother doesn't visit either. \nYou will have to understand and accept that. Just add he had to understand and accept your boundary.", "As a proudly polyamorous person I was SO ready to vote you TA but like... yeah that sounds like hell. A couple questions though:\n\nAre you sure the gf is just the wives gf, or are they possibly a triad? While the law doesn't allow more than 2 people to marry, there's nothing unethical about three people being in a relationship together, and if it's his girlfriend as well you should probably treat his partners equally. To be clear, I'm not saying a V relationship is unethical, just that I understand not treating a family members metamour with the same acceptance of their paramour.\n\nSecondly, is them bossing him around/putting restrictions on his social life part of a negotiated bdsm relationship, or just abuse? Consent makes all the difference - you don't have to like that your brother is submissive to two women, but its certainly not something to villify them for.\n\nIf his wife is abusing him, she should not be welcome in the family either, and you should (GENTLY) try to nudge your brother towards seeking help. If this is a fully consensual situation your brother has agreed to (hell, being cucked by a woman might be HIS fetish the wife is supporting!) then again, you don't have to like it, but accepting your brother means accepting the lifestyle he's chosen.\n\nYou don't need to ask for all the details of your brothers situation, but figuring out if he's consenting seems pretty important. At the moment I dont think anyone is TA, but that more investigation needs to happen or more information needs to be revealed.", "I mean, if you don't like his wife's GF and don't want her around, that's fine. That does not make you a homophobic. I don't understand why your brother wants everyone to accept his lifestyle and make it part of others life as well. \n\nNTA.", "nta.

You clearly care for him. But, while to accept him is to accept his wife, you don't have to accept his wife's GF. It's a shame your brother made this decision but there isn't much to be done. Here's hoping your brother can open his eyes.", "NTA.  If he wants to ruin his life with her, that's his problem, not yours.  You don't need to deal with their bad decisions and you should have boundries with them.  To me that's disgusting that he let's her treat him like that and gets mad at you for not accepting it.", "YTA - \"family is family\" counts for SO too. They not official family but still. YTA for using a petty way to hurt your brother.\n\nYou can have your rules. Those rules hurt your brother. Brother is angry.
