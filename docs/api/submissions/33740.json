On the way there I stopped to get her some sun flowers for the night as she was being presented on the football field. When I stopped at the store to get them I pulled out and a older man backed his truck in to my car. then he took off so I chased him on foot, he finally stopped then said he didn\u2019t do anything ($1500in damage) and proceeded to call me every name in the book. I Had to call the police to even get his insurance information. So to say the least I was stressed. I still got the flowers and went about my trip. I went to the game that night and tried to give her the flowers she ignored me and them. The whole family left but me after she was announced. I wanted  to stay to watch her perform in the marching band being a band member myself when I was in school. As half time was coming she walked by me and I asked about half time she said she wasn\u2019t performing till the end of the game I found it unusual and asked why. She said the other schools band was performing. I never did that in high school or college and told her it was unusual. She ignored me and said well they are good so who cares. As half time came I walked over to her band in the stand to try and talk to her she ignored me for the most part till I saw the band perform I looked at her and said your right shit they\u2019re good. She shhh..Ed me I was like what the hell. Then I saw some very amazing field work done by there guard and I said oh shit that was amazing. She then told me to stop cussing (the same kid that told her grandmother fuck you today). I told her what are you talking about it was only adults around ie guard instructor(tattooed,and pierced) and they didn\u2019t even notice my presence. I told her what you think they don\u2019t say shit. She then raised her voice and screamed at me stop so loud the whole band turned and looked at me. I stopped talking turned away from her and left the game. As I left I called her mother my sister in-law  and she didn\u2019t answer, so I texted her and told her what happened and that I would appreciate if she had a talk with her. That night I got a text from my niece saying simply \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d nothing more I left it unread and didn\u2019t respond. Fast forward to Christmas my family and I are invited to my brothers house for Christmas. We agree and go, I stop at my parents house to help them gather stuff to take to my brothers. When we arrive with hands full my 23m nephew acts lazy and couldn\u2019t even open the door for us. I yell for him to get off the couch and open the door instead of sitting on the couch and fussing with the door Handle. Finally everything is in the house and I step out side for a smoke then I hear everyone rushing to open gifts my 7yo son included so I rush back in side. Everyone finishes with gifts then we are on to food. We eat and my 18niece tries talking to me I acknowledge her but don\u2019t talk to her about much more then getting ready for college (I work with student loans). We move on and things get tense as she  and my other 23yo niece (her sister )insult my mother. So much so my 23yo niece\u2019s  21yo boyfriend is literally nudging her to stop. Everything was coming to a end and my parents go to leave and we agree to leave also. as my wife took thing to our car I said I was going to step out side for a smoke on the back porch. As I step out my 18 yo niece follows then her mother tells her to take the trash to the front. She throws the trash over the rail and I turn my back she began to talk about a guard show and then asks if she had already told me. I informed her no I haven\u2019t talked to since that night she then goes on to say I already said sorry but I told you many times to stop. I informed her I\u2019m a adult I was not saying anything negative and that I didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at. She repeated the same thing twice then brought up\u201d I set a boundary and you didn\u2019t care\u201d. I am out side smoking she could had gone in by this time but she was just Standing there to fight. I told her that she had made the scene that night no one cared but her. She said some bs thinking the school would have bared me or I would have had a repercussion for saying that. Then she slipped and called me by my name and not aunt I normally don\u2019t care but she had me pissed I told her you want to talk about boundaries here\u2019s mine my name to you is \u201caunt tori not tori\u201d then I called her by her full name. My wife saw us at this point and walked out and stopped the whole conversation she told her to go inside and let me be as we were leaving. She then started to cry. So AITA? My wife and my mother both don\u2019t think I was in the wrong but I feel like she will rat me out and flip the script to my sister in law and I just want to know was I wrong?", "created_utc": 1703574039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r2b7k/aita_for_making_my_niece_cry_on_christmas/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
