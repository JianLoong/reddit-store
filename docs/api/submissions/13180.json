For spring break my nephew & niece let's call them \"Brooke and John\" told me \"uncle mike can you pick us up from uni we want to stay with you for spring break?\" I was more than happy to. I picked them up directly from their place. And took them home and they've been living with me for the past few days. \n\nWe've been having a blast, both the kids are homebody types of people. Meaning they enjoy doing things at home, and in peace and quiet. We've been playing video games, relaxing in the patio, gardening together, playing water volleyball, and watching movies at home together and it's been amazing. I love those two. Growing up as kids, they've always spent more time with me than their mom and dad let's call them \"Julie and Adam\".\n\n Julie and adam no offense, to them. They are complicated, they don't get along well and they don't believe in divorce etc. It's a whole lot of problems it's whatever. So Brookee and john, have always spent more time with me than those two. It was often \"uncle mike can we stay with you tonight?\", Cann you pick us up from school today?\" and i always did. Out of the 7days, they always stayed like 5-6 days in a week at my house. Meaning it'd be me, who'd wake them up, get them ready for school, make breakfast, drop them off etc. \n\nAdam is always cool with it, he actually encourages me and tells me \"Yeah, it's best those two stay with you as i don't want them to be in this environment\". So brooke and john have always been with me most of the time. \n\nWell yesterday, me and the kids are relaxing in the backyard patio. We have the bonfire on nicely we're just talking, having a good time and all. Till on my security app starts making a notification that someone at the door banging. Well, i open the app, and look who it is. My sister, lol. She's screaming and saying OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR! The door is made out of steel and metal, and it was custom made and so it won't open unless i authorize it to open. And it's hard to break open as well. \n\nI tell the kids, hey guys your moms is here do you want to see her? Kids say no. I then ignore it well their mom keeps banging on the door and through the camera's speaker i tell her \"The kids don't want to see you, leave.\" she just doesn't listen and is keep banging. Then she tires herself out and left. I gave Adam a call and he said \"don't worry about her, and thanks for taking care of the kids\" i said \"no problem\".\n\nso AITA for not letting her in?", "created_utc": 1679767543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121ty2j/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_come_in_my_house/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You asked them if they wanted to see their mother, they said no. You were abiding by their wishes.\n\nBoth of their parents are awful in different ways. It just sounds like Adam's just managed to smooth-talk you into making you believe that his neglect and lack of care for his children is \"in their best interests\" and buttering you up so you could be the only real parent that they've had so he could look like the good guy whilst abandoning his children just as much as Julie has.\n\nThere's obviously a lot more going on behind the scenes in their marriage, but it's good that you're the one who's prioritising the kids.

However, he may have felt at the time that he made the right decision to let you take care of his children so they wouldn't have to grow up in a toxic environment. But in reality, what he should've done is being a good responsible parent and put his childrens wellbeing first by separating from his wife and removing himself and the kids from the situation.
