I've been working there for about 1 year and 8 months now and earlier this year I decided to quit. My employer only asked me why and I told her due to the gas prices having been increased, I couldn't make ends meet with having to spend all my money on fuel to get to work and that I will be  looking for other part-time jobs closer to my home.\nMy employer then said that she didn't want to lose me as I am a \"valuable worker\" in her eyes and that she offered giving me a raise. She then continued asking me not to tell any of my co-workers and I complied.\n\nNaturally, I did tell my friends and my family.\n\nA month later they needed more people to fill in for shifts and I asked my friend(Let's call her Lucy) if she wanted to help out and she said she'll only be able to help out for 2 months as she wanted to only focus on her studies. During that time we carpooled and the first 2 months she paid half of the gas money even though I told  her she didn't have to and after that she stopped. Well, 2 months turned into 6 months now and Lucy was adamant about getting a raise as well. At first I was surprised, because it wasn't like she  paid for gas or rent at home as she lived with her parents still. I just asked her not to mention my name and about me telling her about my raise. We went through what she was going to say probably about a thousand times and she promised not to mention me and play dumb if they asked about me.\n\nTo my surprise, I got called into the office and my employer only told me how she thought she could trust me with confidential information such as my salary and that I betrayed her trust. Apperantly Lucy told our employer about my income and that she would like to have the same amount and after much discussion my employer obliged . Now my employer doesn't want to look me in the eyes and gives me the cold shoulder.\n\nI texted Lucy and she was pretty nonchalant about it responding with: \"Yeah they asked about you and I couldn't lie to them\". No apologies. Just that. \n\nI was quite angry and I asked her not to approach me on campus as I needed space.Lucy did  call me afterwards saying that I'm being a \"drama queen\" and that it was \"not that deep\". After that  I changed shifts so that we would not be working together for the next 2 months so she'd have to get to work via her own transport(she would have to drive with her mom's car). All my friends have confronted me saying that I'm overreacting and being petty, making me feel like I am the villain. I just feel betrayed after sharing something confidential with someone I thought was my real friend outside of work...\nLesson learnt: Never talk about your salary with anyone\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692459229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vjbt8/aita_for_refusing_to_carpool_with_my_friend_to/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I suggest looking for other jobs, there is absolutely nothing for them to be guilt tripping you about.\n\nAlso your friend sucks (not for asking for a raise.

First of all, it\u2019s actually illegal for your employer to prohibit you from discussing your salary with your coworkers. \n\nThat being said, just because it\u2019s illegal for them to ask you this doesn\u2019t mean that this won\u2019t have negative consequences for your working environment. Your friend promised to keep her mouth shut, she should\u2019ve kept her word.", "NTA. She's not a friend. She sold you out for her benefit  which sadly you gave her the ammunition to do. But that does mean she is not entitled to friendship benefits from you. She can pay her transport fees from her new salary increase. But you seem to have taken the lesson - don't mix friendship and work. Too often pay and bonuses come from a small pot so people in competition. \n\nBut the real AH is your employer. That type of game is not nice and it is illegal in many places not to allow employees to discuss salary so as to prevent discrimination.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You trusted your \"friend\" not a random coworker with this information. If she can bite you in the back, you have every right to deny her any benefit she was getting out of you.", "NTA , she could've asked for the raise without betraying your confidence, as for the 'friends' tell them if they feel that strongly about it, they should drive her to work themselves", "NTA who needs \"friends\" like that.", "NTA. Backstabbers aren\u2019t friends.", "NTA. Repeat after me: those people are not my friends. Loose them. And do not refer anyone to your workplace. Always ends badly for the referer.", "NTA.

It is a federal right to talk about your salary. Sorry OP Lucy AND your boss are the AH not you. NTA", "You are angry at the wrong person.  Your employer has reasons for trying to keep you from talking about your pay with your coworkers; it's called exploitation.  Your employer wants to pay all of you as little as they can get away with while maintaining a compliant, competent workforce.  Convincing you to keep your wage increases to yourself, and emotionally manipulating you into feeling guilty about having 'betrayed her trust' or whatever, is just.  No.\nStop being angry at your friend for advocating for herself.  Start being angry at your employer for manipulating and exploiting you all.\n\nEdit; NTA, but neither is your friend.  Your boss is TA.", "best policy is for everyone to tell co workers their salaries. in some states it is illegal for employer to prohibit it. it's a scam by employers to keep salaries down.", "NTA strictly because she could have asked for a raise without including you in it.

Nothing else outside of that matters at this point", "man you got them shit ass friends...", "NTA, she got the rise she can pay for her gas and car.", "Wait, as I understand it, Lucy wasn't an employee at the time you mentioned your raise?

If your boss tries to punish you, you have options to fight back. Your employer is definitely an A.H.\n\n2: Your friend should not have thrown you under the bus when you ask her not to talk about you. She has no right to be upset now that her raise is likely negated by the fact that she has to pay for her own transportation. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.\n\n3: \"Lesson learnt: Never talk about your salary with anyone\". Everyone should discuss their salary with coworkers. Lack of wage transparency is how employers keep employees poor and standing up for themselves during salary discussions. Your boss was wrong to tell you not to talk about it with you coworkers. \n\n\nNTA OP. You've done nothing wrong. Your boss and your coworker suck though.", "NTA. Your friend and your employer are though.", "ESH, mostly your employer though. They wanted you to keep your raise a secret because they don't want to pay all their employees that amount. That failed and now they're taking it out on you.\n\nAs for you and Lucy, to be honest you kind of dug your own grave there. Frankly, they likely figured out you told her even before she spilled the beans -- that they asked about you is proof enough. So while it was wrong of her to break her promise, I can't blame her too much for taking the bag once she realized the jig was up. This was a mutual mistake, not hers alone.", "YTA. It was illegal for your employer to tell you to not share your salary. Not sharing your pay hurts you and the other cashiers, not the boss. Also, if you get with a group of your coworkers and talk to the boss together, it protects all of you.", "ESH. You said you told your friends and family. How did Lucy find out? You had no business telling her. What did you expect?", "It really boils down to you goofing and telling other people. It was just SO HARD for you to not spill, and this is the result! ESH because she\u2019s also a rat for telling.", "YTA.
