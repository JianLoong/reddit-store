Well, 2 months turned into 6 months now and Lucy was adamant about getting a raise as well.

I have said this before and I will say it again if you know to keep your mouth shut about something and you blab to others you can be mad that they are just as incapable as you are of keeping a secret. Your boss was nice enough to give you a raise as she valued you as an employee and you shot your mouth off to friends and family about something that didn\u2019t have to be mentioned but you chose to mention it. She is also the AH for betraying you and using you like that but you proved to your boss your not trustworthy and can\u2019t keep your mouth shut so is it really a surprise she now won\u2019t be talking to you. Next time keep your mouth closed", "NTA you carpool with whoever you want. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is an AH for not being able to handle a salary negotiation without throwing someone else under the bus.", "NTA-she\u2019s ok with lying to you )promising not to mention you and your info) but can\u2019t lie to the employer? \n\nseems she\u2019s ok with lying when it benefits her\u2026", "I hope the employer knows that Lucy wasn\u2019t working at the time and wasn\u2019t expected to work at that place when she was told about the raise. Might help the employer make up their mind.", "Correct, but depending on the situation, it might not be in your own best interests to discuss salary with coworkers, as OP found out.", "Came here to post this. In the US she's not even supposed to ask you not to discuss it, much less expect you to never talk about it over a long time period.", "Her employer asked her as a favor. I don't think she forbade it or anything. It was just a breach of confidence. \n\nYou have to decide which bridges are worth burning, even if you technically in the right (legally or otherwise)", "As far as I'm aware, it is federally illegal to prevent employees from discussing wages in any way, so it's illegal in all 50 states.", "IF OP is in the US that would be correct.", "Actually if you re-read it, I think you would be wrong. it was stated they asked her not to talk about it, not forbade it. I can ask you to do anything within reason. I cannot compel you to.", "Also, her boss asked her to not share the info with any co-workers. She said nothing about friends or family. And OP made it very clear that, at the time, this other girl was just a friend. It was only later that they became a co-worker.\n\nOP did nothing wrong.", "The culture of seeing an employer giving someone a raise as \u201cdoing them a solid\u201d is part of the reason why wages have stagnated globally. We shouldn\u2019t have to be grateful to our employers for paying us enough to allow us to live/pay for gas to get to work. It should be the standard.", "It\u2019s hard because you know the boss isn\u2019t going to do anything overt but if a opportunity comes up to promote OP, they might not give it to them because of this.  \n\nIt\u2019s slimy but it\u2019s all hidden. Ops friend still put her in a bad spot.", ":( when OP discussed it though, it was only with someone she thought was a friend. \"lucy\" wasn't a co-worker at the time.", "Why? if they start limiting hours/ refusing advancement you now have a pretty solid foundation for a retaliation claim. The idea that there might be times you don\u2019t want to discuss salary is exactly what employers want. Doesn\u2019t mean we need to discuss it 24/7 but an employers general goal is to limit communication of these things because it empowers the employees to seek higher wages. For all we know, every single person at her workplace has her salary, and they are all really important workers with a special raise they shouldn\u2019t let others know about. Cause that makes it a hell of a lot less likely for them to request a further raise.", "I thought it depends on the state?", "When you get asked to do something from someone in a position of power over you, it is very difficult to argue that it is not a demand in all but name. There is an implied threat of retaliation from someone who has the power to back it up if you don't comply with the \"request\".", "She agreed to hold the rise confidential. All this is not a legal issue. It is an issue of trust between two people.", "She shouldn't have told anybody. \n\nShe reminds me of my friend and a companion who were admiring an old lighthouse and the custodian started talking to my friend and telling her the history and some interesting stories. Then he said, \"we are not supposed to let anyone inside, but if you promise not to tell anyone .......\"   They went inside and enjoyed their private tour so much that when they went to a nearby restaurant, my friend's friend immediately told their waitress in a loud voice, \"We just got a tour inside the lighthouse!\"  \n\nThe poor old custodian was being kind and they could have gotten him fired!", "is it illegal to give an employee the cold shoulder?", "I guess I assumed she told Lucy when they were discussing the new job? The timeline isn't clear.", ">Why?\n\nThe why has already been answered. OP had someone at work who they considered a friend, and that friendship has potentially been strained because of the pay discrepancy.\n\nObviously, if you don't care about that, then it doesn't matter and go ahead and discuss away. That's why I said \"depending on the situation.\"\n\n>if they start limiting hours/ refusing advancement you now have a pretty solid foundation for a retaliation claim.\n\nVery doubtful.

What Lucy did was really underhanded because she deliberately got OOP in trouble. I\u2019m willing to bet she didn\u2019t explain that she knew before she started working there so OOP had no way of knowing she would become a coworker", "Yes these things are at the employees discretion, but its still illegal to consider sharing information of wages in these decisions, otherwise it would be practically impossible to enforce the law protecting that right.", "Sure it's illegal, but unless the employer is dumb enough to actually tell the employee they are doing it as retaliation, it will be very difficult to prove.\n\nThe employer can come up with a dozen reasons for not promoting you.", "Except if OP has any proof of these conversations and there content, which admittedly they might not, the burden of proof is now on the employer."]}
