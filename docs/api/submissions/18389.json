Well, I come home 2 days ago, and I walk in to my apartment completely turned upside down. All of my furniture is rearranged, every single item in my apartment was now in a different spot. All of my bathroom items, art supplies, school work, my dishes are reorganized and I still have no idea where my items even are in this place. I feel like I\u2019m in someone else\u2019s apartment. The worst part was that I have a closet where I keep my sex toys, and I thought, surely my mother must recognize some sort of line not to be crossed? Nope, she had gone through and reorganized my sex toys. I am mortified and embarrassed, and it will take me weeks to put everything back where it belongs.
