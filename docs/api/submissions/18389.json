My sister and I have had consistent issues with my mom not respecting my boundaries or privacy, but this really sent me over the edge. Whenever my mom comes to my apartment, she will try to hang photos, coat hooks, and general decor without asking me first. I\u2019ve asked her many times to stop doing this because I\u2019ve worked hard on making my apartment exactly how I wanted it, and although she means well, I really don\u2019t want her changing things without my permission. Recently, I went on vacation for 10 days. She wanted to house sit and water my plants for me while I was gone, of course I was super happy she was willing to do that. I did reiterate to her that I did NOT want her reorganizing, redecorating, or changing anything about my apartment. She laughs and tells me she won\u2019t and to stop being so dramatic. Well, I come home 2 days ago, and I walk in to my apartment completely turned upside down. All of my furniture is rearranged, every single item in my apartment was now in a different spot. All of my bathroom items, art supplies, school work, my dishes are reorganized and I still have no idea where my items even are in this place. I feel like I\u2019m in someone else\u2019s apartment. The worst part was that I have a closet where I keep my sex toys, and I thought, surely my mother must recognize some sort of line not to be crossed? Nope, she had gone through and reorganized my sex toys. I am mortified and embarrassed, and it will take me weeks to put everything back where it belongs. I asked her why she would do this and she said my apartment \u201cneeded to be cleaned\u201d. I asked her why she wouldn\u2019t ask me to do this or even mention it. She just told me she did a good thing and she doesn\u2019t feel bad about it. I pretty much exploded and made her leave immediately. But, I still can\u2019t help feeling bad. Maybe she really thought she was helping me? But I can\u2019t ignore the fact I asked her repeatedly not to do this, and she feels no remorse about it.

Many in the older generation tend to be like this, so alas, I'm disappointed but not surprised.\n\nMany parents feel that they know better than their children in all aspects, since obviously they lived more than us(there's no logic in this) and I am baffled at this crazy thinking.

I may not like their decor (or lack there of) but it\u2019s their choice.  And going way back, my mother would never have done this to me- and she was born in 1925.  So I think this is more a control issue than an age issue.", "My sister did this. But Mum had checked the tops of doors and pictures when she visited so well deserved. She also replaced part of my carpet and hung curtains in shed. She did make me curtains for living room but by consent. Worst was my parents helped me move and they stayed new house, me and partner old flat for logistics. The mortgage was huge thing to me to get but she never got why I was upset when I brought stuff to new house and she opened door to welcome me to \"her house\". She also threatened to rehome my pets and report me to RSPCA if got pets she felt unsuitable.
