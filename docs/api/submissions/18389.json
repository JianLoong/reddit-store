I told my mother to stop and thankfully, she listened. She does this with my brother's house, too (he lets her, although complaining about it to me). It has nothing to do with cleaning. It has to do with not letting go of your children, not being able to accept they are adults and it has everything to do with having two homes to rule and control. It makes them feel empowered. This has to stop and you did the right thing.", ">she will try to hang photos, coat hooks, and general decor without asking me first.\n\nI...I would literally scream if someone came into my home and began trying to nail up some shitty painting or Live Laugh Love placard because they thought their taste superior to mine. \n\n>She just told me she did a good thing and she doesn\u2019t feel bad about it.\n\nThis is why you're NTA. Well, that and the part where you said absolutely **don't fucking do this.** Your mother did this and is patting herself on the back for what is a **huge** violation of privacy and trust. Frankly, I'm almost half tempted to suggest this was some kind of overt power play, where your mother hear you tell her not to do something and she so dramatically went against it because she wanted to show that you \"can't control her\" or that her authority is more meaningful.\n\nYeah, she on the surface seems like she was \"trying to help\", but just the level of invasion alone is enough to call this highly suspect. Not to mention that \"organizing\" things is meaningless when it's to a system the person you're organizing for **doesn't know.**", "You know how she is. And you let her house-sit anyway? You're not an asshole, but you also weren't very smart if you actually expected her to resoect boundaries. I mean, if she does this kind of stuff with you home. Why on earth would you expect anything better with you being gone?\n\nYou kinda did this to yourself.", "Change the locks", "NTA When you repeatedly tell someone you don't want them to do something, and then they do it anyway, it's not a good thing.", "As a mom let me tell you this was a power play on her part. She is not going to admit you are grown up and don\u2019t need her like you used to.", "Nta. Wow. That's really over the line. Esp once you asked her not to do it. I would start going to her house when shes out & doing the same (put things in absolutely inconvenient places, like the dishes in the basement). She will get the point.", "NTA Don\u2019t you feel bad about sending her packing!", "I was gunna say surprise her when you take the key bc if you tell her in advance, she\u2019ll make copies, but yeah good idea, just change the locks", "Interesting tip. I don\u2019t hide my sex toys or my drugs. Both have appropriate storage in boxes and spaces allocated. Longer toys like whips are in the same style Ikea storage bag as the wrapping paper next to it that the item was designed for. I live alone and eh if you open my cupboard with the hoover in search of wrapping paper and get a dildo so be it. Esp if you didn\u2019t ask.\n\nThe drugs are in the first aid shelf beside the ones you buy in licenced venues. Again if you find white powder uninvited that\u2019s on you. \n\nWhat is hidden is my diary. I grew up with a mother like this and that would be her jackpot. My brother read my diary when I was about 10 when it was \u2018swimming today. We got to use the floats!\u2019 level stuff and wrote in it on his birthday which is late spring \u2018your diary is pointless. Like you.\u2019 Power play to remind me nothing, nothing in my life was mine unless I hid it away. Both egregious boundary stompers.\n\nI learned that hiding stuff in plain sight aka I am not ashamed of this so you cannot use it against me is a very good tactic with wannabe power players.\n\nThat said I have despite my childhood and fairly heavy drug use at times, not needed to hide drugs from drug cops and I suspect that\u2019s a very different thing. But in my experience of stop and search they often feel like checking for drugs where sex toys usually go so I see why your buddy would say that\u2026.\n\nThe only thing surprises me is people hide-hide sex toys. I am laughing imagine horny people having to deal with the equivalent of child proof lids mid sexy moment because of this or being so organised beforehand they get a smorgasbord out to be sure. I am organized but lazy. I want to be able to reach them one handed without too much moving!"]}
