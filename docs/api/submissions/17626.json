Why does he want to be independent from you?  Are you clingy?", "I'm gonna go with NTA, but I understand where your friend is coming from. For me, as shitty as my job can be. It's the only time I can just be alone and turn off for a bit. But that's something that really depends on the job. \n\nI've also worked with friends and spouses in the past, and it can cause problems in a relationship. For example, outside of work I'm normally a super laid-back person. But at work, I'm way more focused and determined.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re free to interview for and accept the job, he\u2019s free to not want to work with you and stop talking to you.", "NTA. A rising tide lifts all boats. Your friend is TA and should be stoked to have a coworker they can trust. Companies typically give referral bonuses if you help them to fill the role, your friend is potentially missing out by being petty. Definitely do not cancel and sacrifice a potential job you are excited about for this jealous clown.", "NTA\n\nWhat gives your friend the right to stop you from taking this opportunity? It's dumb and sounds like that friend isn't much of a friend to begin with.", "NTA\n\nThis is not your friend.  You will not get this job through nepotism because you know your friend.  You will get the job (if it's offered) based on merit and the skills you can bring to it.\n\nI would wonder whether your former friend is jealous and is worried you will overshadow him and rise higher than he ever can.\n\nHow big is the company?  If it's a big company, then this is a good opportunity for your own career and I would follow this through.  If it's just 3 other employees, then perhaps better to pass because you will be working in close proximity to your friend and it may not be worth it.", "NTA friends don't gate keep friends from applying to jobs. Its up to the company who they want to hire. If he don't have the skills hey are not getting hired anyways. At least this way one of you might get a job.", "NTA\n\nThere's no guarantee either one of you will get the job.", "A \"friend\" saying this to me would ultimately end the friendship for me anyway. I couldn't remain friendly with someone who would actively try to keep me from achieving success. Definitely finish the application process, and if you get the job, show him how professional you are by maintaining a cordially cold demeanor in his presence.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t back out of this. Also, if you don\u2019t talk anymore, problem solved! Look, seriously, a true friend would not be like this.", "You have a selfish friend. That's just not a friend to me. Friends empower you and want you to succeed. I don't see how you'd be holding him back, but it's clear how he's holding you back. \n\nThen I put myself in his position to see how I would feel. I would want my friend to tell me they were applying to the same company as soon as they knew. If you did this and didn't hide it, I'd want you to get the job!", "nta - since he dont speak to you anymore then the situation is now solved so continue the interview process and if u get the job congrats!", "NTA. \n\nShould you both be hired you are always free to turn down the offer. You may not even be working in the same department.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He just wants to be independent in general, he still lives with his parents and this is his first job. Sorry if that didn\u2019t come across right!", "That\u2019s a good perspective too, thank you so much!", "Yeah, the OP has every right to interview for whatever company is recruiting, and the friend has every right to not want to work with friends. It's not about \\~gatekeeping a job\\~, it's that for many people it's simply not a great idea to work with friends. Little things about a friend that you would normally brush off may be a real pain for one's worksona when that friend is suddenly also a coworker. It's understandable. NAH", "It\u2019s a pretty big company, they have over 120 centers worldwide. Thank you so much for the feedback!", "They already have the job. He wants me to stop interviewing there because they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. Paraphrasing his words if I truly cared about him and how comfortable he was, professionalism shouldn\u2019t matter, I should just stop.", "In his eyes I cause a lot of problems, this was probably the final straw for him. \nThank you for the feedback, for so long I felt like I was TA here!", "First step in being independent is being mature enough to know it doesn\u2019t matter who you work with, friends or enemies or strangers. Keep going with your interview and get that job. This is your friend\u2019s immature problem.", ">In his eyes I cause a lot of problems\n\nWhat do you mean?", "Well THAT'S spicy, you gonna elaborate?", "Info : is there a reason your friend might want to set boundaries with you?", "You may need to decide which is more important. You can absolutely cancel an interview in a professional manner (I assume if they offer it to you, you intend on taking it because if not it\u2019s even more unprofessional to waste everyone\u2019s time). People cancel interviews all the time (circumstances change). Your friend has asked you if he can keep this for himself. A new job can be an opportunity to try be a \u2018new you\u2019. I left one team where I had joined as the most junior member of the team so was always seen as that - in my new team I was seen as someone brining knowledge and experience. If he feels he lost that opportunity he may decide he has to make a choice and decide you\u2019re not afriend.", "NAH", "NTA He is being overly sensitive. In work, you take on work roles, your friendship is not particularly relevant.", "So in general I think your friend is in the wrong to ask this of you. Professional and personal should always be kept separate and it's just as wrong to want someone to work with you because you're friends as it is to want someone to drop a job opportunity. That said, how big is this company and how closely will you be working? And what would this role be in relation to his. \n\nI'm not saying you should drop it if the answer is you'll be in the same small office and you might be his boss but you have to be realistic here. Working closely together with friends can prove too much for a friendship. When office politics clashes with your friendship it can be hard to maintain the friendship- especially if one of you was always salty about the situation from the get go. You have to be realistic that if you were to take this job your friendship may not survive. \n\nIt doesn't make you a bad person if you decide that's a risk worth taking but you do have to have the grace here to recognise he might not be able to handle this and not get angry or resentful with him (at least in the office).", "Please elaborate- this feels important context\u2026 that you\u2019ve deliberately left out in your favour", "Then he isn't your friend? Either he's an AH who is rude and dismissive of you or you're insinuating yourself into someone else's life and not getting the hint that they aren't your friend which makes you the AH. Either way thos person is not your friend.", "Consider if you want to work there \u2018with\u2019 him. If he doesn\u2019t want you there he can make it a very negative experience.", "Emotional blackmail. My favourite. \n\nI don\u2019t really get why he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable tho?", "And if the friendship doesn't survive, the working relationship probably won't either, so one of them probably won't be kept on after probation.", "OP, since you have admitted elsewhere here: \"In his eyes I cause a lot of problems, this was probably the final straw for him\" it sounds like there is a lot more to this story.", "NTA, since you are not talking anymore, why lose out on the job? He need to learn to deal with his problems and not make it yours.", "Some people do not want to be roommates with their friends because it changes the dynamic too much.\nThis is something similar.\nAlso you've said that he thinks you cause a lot of problems, so he probably does not see you as a suitable coworker.\nIf you are a friend and you care about him, you respect this boundary.\n\n\nYeah there's no rule you're breaking or something, but not respecting a reasonable boundary (especially with the context you've refused to elaborate on) makes YTA", "NTA\n\nAnother option is not being friends with him", "No but your friend is a mighty big AH.", "OP could be a stalker type of \"friend\". It does seem strange they just happened to look for jobs when their friend was looking - at the same jobs.", "NTA keep the interview and the job if offered. You are NOT joined at the hip"]}
