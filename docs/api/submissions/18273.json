Withholding education, especially in a way that restricts a person's ability to be successful, or pursue their goals is abusive. Period.\n\nSo while I do understand the feelings of animosity towards the English language speaking as a person whose people were colonized, and had genocide committed against them by the British. To deliberately withhold that education from your niece is unacceptable.", "NTA. she's not a dog, she's a human being who, upon turning 18yrs old, will be in charge of her own life and career choices. wanting to educate one's self should not be limited to only adults. you can't achieve certain things in life if you don't start preparing for them during childhood. can someone become a lawyer late in life? absolutely, but it won't be with the same advantages as one would have by preparing for it in childhood. language barriers should not be enforced by parents like this. i'm sorry, but refusing to allow a person to educate themselves in a way that opens their world should not be allowed.", "NTA since it sounds like your niece will need it in the future and better to learn when you are young I'm kind of curious what is her native language because the \"white imperialists\" don't only speak English", "Info: So suddenly you are spending way more time with her (and only her, not her brother) and he hasn't noticed or said anything?", "Does your brother speak English?", "ESH. You\u2019re not an asshole in my opinion. His reasoning is stupid. You went against his wishes without asking.

Many ex colonial countries kept English as their legal language because they have so many native/national languages. India would be an example of this 380+ languages uses English in its courts.", "I have both a niece and nephew but I am only teaching my niece since my nephew isn\u2019t interested.", "I babysit both my niece and nephew, and spend about the same amount of time with them.

OP definitely not the AH for helping his niece learn English. I agree with you on the fact that the brother is being stupid.", "I think mandarin has the largest number of native speakers in the world, as opposed to english that is most commonly used as a second language.", "Mandarin does have the most speakers, but the vast majority of the f them are within China.

Personally, I think the more languages you know, the better.

Yes, English is a white imperialists\u2019 language. Yes, that sucks, as does the rest of the Empire\u2019s impact on the world. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that being fluent in it, especially as she seems to speak at least one other language already, will open up huge opportunities for her.

No good will come from making a kid keep secrets from their parents. And kids should know it\u2019s not acceptable to have secrets.

This isn\u2019t just a teenager rebelling against her dad. This is a requirement for the career she wants. And extra languages of any kind always an enhancement. I wanted to speak Spanish fluently. My mother was in the army and stationed in Panama so I knew she had spoke it a little at some point, but she always said she forgot it by the time I asked. 20 years later I discovered that she still spoke it fluently. She was in a nursing home recovering and spoke it with her Latino CNA, fluently! I was crushed. You are doing your niece a favor by teaching her a language she wants to learn and actually needs it for her career. You are saving her a lifetime of disappointment.

Your brother is ridiculous", "NTA, imagine being so racist that you're willing to sabotage the future of your children.", "NTA\n\nSomeone needs to tell your brother that you cannot overcome the enemy if you don't know what they're saying.\n\nIf he really cared about throwing off the imperialist yoke, he'd want his daughter to have every tool available.", "YTA If your brother dont want his daughter know english its his decision, not yours.", "NTA - but if father is adamant about no english and you can't do otherwise.
