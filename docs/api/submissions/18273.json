Idiot.", "It\u2019s hard enough for women to get ahead in certain careers without parents putting artificial obstacles in their way. \n\nNTA\n\nYour niece will thank you in the future and your brother needs to get over himself.

So useful in so many ways", "NTA.

Withholding education, especially in a way that restricts a person's ability to be successful, or pursue their goals is abusive. Period.\n\nSo while I do understand the feelings of animosity towards the English language speaking as a person whose people were colonized, and had genocide committed against them by the British. To deliberately withhold that education from your niece is unacceptable.", "NTA. she's not a dog, she's a human being who, upon turning 18yrs old, will be in charge of her own life and career choices. wanting to educate one's self should not be limited to only adults. you can't achieve certain things in life if you don't start preparing for them during childhood. can someone become a lawyer late in life? absolutely, but it won't be with the same advantages as one would have by preparing for it in childhood. language barriers should not be enforced by parents like this. i'm sorry, but refusing to allow a person to educate themselves in a way that opens their world should not be allowed.", "NTA since it sounds like your niece will need it in the future and better to learn when you are young I'm kind of curious what is her native language because the \"white imperialists\" don't only speak English", "Info: So suddenly you are spending way more time with her (and only her, not her brother) and he hasn't noticed or said anything?", "Does your brother speak English?", "ESH. You\u2019re not an asshole in my opinion. His reasoning is stupid. You went against his wishes without asking. Personally I see no problem in this but it would\u2019ve been smart to ask him first to see how he really feels about it.", "I have a feeling that the father also doesn't think girls should attend a law school.", "Plus it's the language of trade, business, finance, aviation, maritime operations, and so on.", "Depending on the country it may be the language of the legal system. Many ex colonial countries kept English as their legal language because they have so many native/national languages. India would be an example of this 380+ languages uses English in its courts.", "I have both a niece and nephew but I am only teaching my niece since my nephew isn\u2019t interested.", "I babysit both my niece and nephew, and spend about the same amount of time with them.

Is English the only obstacle, and her father agrees for her to study Law?  he sounds obsessed.", "I mean if you don\u2019t want to ruin a relationship with your sibling then yeah it\u2019s probably smarter to ask first. OP definitely not the AH for helping his niece learn English. I agree with you on the fact that the brother is being stupid.", "I think mandarin has the largest number of native speakers in the world, as opposed to english that is most commonly used as a second language.", "Mandarin does have the most speakers, but the vast majority of the f them are within China. English is across the world."]}
