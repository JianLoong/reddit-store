If that is why you don't want her around your child, it is fine.  \n\nBut it is fair for grandparents to not really want to be on-call babysitters.  That seems to most inconsequential of the reasons to keep your mom away.", "If I keep getting calls at all hours, I may block all the numbers calling me.", "I always thought it was some made up stuff for attention, but unfortunately it does happen. It hurts that they haven't even asked my side, they hear whatever my mom told them and that's good enough I guess...", "Can confirm this is exactly  how they act. Saw it first hand with my wife's family. Her dad is a awful person and when my wife decided  she wanted  nothing to do with him he bad mouthed her to the rest if the family. Had her grandma, aunt and sister calling her up and cursing her out. It got so bad I had to get on the phone and tell them where to go.", "Best example I have is when I was younger(about 13-14) I was lying in bed sick as a dog, and she scoffed in my face, gave me expired meds that didn't do much and told me to \"get over it.\" But when my sister was sick, she ran to 3 different stores to get my sister whatever she could need to feel better. That includes meds, clothes, groceries, shoes and new pillows.", "I wholeheartedly always believed she is, but no one else seems to see it. My sister's staying out of it for now, but I have a sinking feeling she'll be on my mom's side.", "Because of the character limit, I couldn't explain in depth, but my mom has a serious problem with crying/negative emotions(anger, jealousy etc.) Any sign of tears and she's redder than a tomato and screaming about how I or other kids shouldn't be crying. (My sister wasn't much of an emotional child, probably for that reason.) I responded in another comment about how when I was sick, she'd give me expired meds and tell me to get other it. While if my sister was sick she'd go to multiple store and get her whatever to feel better. \n\nIf my nephews got hurt and cried, she'd scream at them about it, causing them to cry more. She'd storm off and leave them with me, which I didn't want. She'd take their toys/tablets away just cause she \"wanted to spend time with them\" or \"they shouldn't even have screens\" that I agree with. If they even raise their voices at all, she'd be dialing my sister to get them. If they got dirt in the house, she'd get on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor complaining about how she didn't want them there in the first place. Just a lot of crap that made me 100% sure she should never watch my kids unsupervised.\n\nEdit: Just re-read the \"sticking it to mom\" part. I wasn't doing it for my sister, I'm not close to her either. I'm doing it because I saw what she was like with the kids when my sister wasn't there.
