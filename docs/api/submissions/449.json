Of course my insurance expired recently so a repair is gonna be a couple hundred bucks, and I\u2019m way too nervous to bust it open and try to fix it myself in case I wreck it more.\n\nNow my sister (16F) goes to this super fancy school where they make you pay for Macbooks, and she has 2 since they make you get another after a certain number of years. On top of this, she has a brand new, super expensive gaming PC. I asked her that since my laptop is out until I can pay for repairs/wait for it to get repaired (which is probably a few weeks) if I could borrow hers so I can study for my upcoming exams (all materials and the exams themselves are online). She said I could use one BUT she would have to sign in on it (aka I can\u2019t make a log in) and I wouldnt be able to transfer any files, download anything etc. because she has no storage. I asked if she could give me her older Macbook since I know that once you get a new laptop they unlink the school admin locks so anyone can sign in, but she says that thats her main computer. She has exams too, so she\u2019s using all three things at once and letting me use the one is already an inconvenience. She said to \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d which is fair enough, but I\u2019m just a bit confused. She can\u2019t transfer any files to her PC or a different Macbook? She\u2019s using her old laptop as her main one for school even though its unlinked?\n\nI can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s being stubborn and spoilt having three devices or if it\u2019s really an issue for her. I was definitely trying to be nice when I asked but all her terms made it pretty much redundant for me to use. Obviously its me asking for a big favour, but is it too much to ask that she cuts me some slack and try to figure something out for me?

Your parents would \"take her side\" because they're her computers.  It has nothing to do with \"middle kid syndrome.\" She has an older Macbook with software specific to that Macbook, and she wants to keep it.  She can't transfer it to her school PC because it's locked down by her school.  I don't know why that's so hard for someone in this day and age to understand.  \n\nYou're an adult, and you should accept responsibility for your actions.  No one asked you to smack your laptop hard enough to warp it. How do you even do that?   It's weird and entitled to demand that your kid sister fork over her electronics because you couldn't take care of your own things.  Instead of demanding equipment from your sister that costs hundreds of dollars, why can't you ask your parents if they'll lend you the couple hundred bucks to repair your laptop?", "It sounds like we aren't getting the whole story. Like, why would you go right to your sister to ask her for a computer that you know she's actively using, instead of talking to your parents? Her going to a private school is irrelevant here. Do you have a history of damaging your computers or something? This whole situation sounds off \n\nGonna go with YTA for going straight to a 16 year old and refusing to even approach your parents, who can clearly afford to help you here.", "YTA if you keep hassling her about it. You asked to borrow someone else\u2019s property, they gave you their conditions. Take it or leave it. It\u2019s not on her to transfer files to and from or change her usual routine up.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsking ONCE was fine.", "\\>  is it too much to ask that she cuts me some slack and try to figure something out for me? \n\nIt's OK for you to ask, and it's OK for her to say no.  YTA cause you did not respect her answer.", "YTA\n\nI do not understand why you'd need to get your own login on her laptop. Also, she has her own established system of using her electronics, she's already lending you her brand new gaming laptop, but that's apparently not good enough for you. \n\nYou could ask your parents for a loan to get your laptop fixed.", "YTA\n\nI'd be wary of lending you a computer took given you just broke one, it's natural that she's giving you a lot of restrictions. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.", "Yta solve your own problems", "NAH If your parents can afford to send your little sister to a school that requires *ahem* multiple MacBooks over a few years, then they can afford to help you out here to fix your computer. I\u2019d just ask them for help. Computers are a real personal thing and some people don\u2019t like to lend them out, which is understandable. It\u2019s not your sisters fault she\u2019s in the school she is.", "NTA... Your sister is a spoiled brat. She has 3 computers and uses them all for school?! I doubt it. I'm not saying she has the obligation to let you borrow one of them, but for sure she could stop being a brat, because I'm sure she doesn't need all 3 at the same time.\nIf you don't have any other option for a computer, like in a library or some else to ask, you should keep trying to negotiate with that AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So far none of my applications have even gotten a callback. Today travelling to university I dented the corner of my laptop with the power button and the sensitivity is screwed so it shuts down after about 4 seconds.

I was definitely trying to be nice when I asked and was visibly confused when she gave me the terms, but at this point I haven\u2019t bothered: I wouldn\u2019t even be able to access my reading material since its all PDFs that are downloads only. Obviously its me asking for a big favour, but is it too much to ask that she cuts me some slack and try to figure something out for me? I\u2019m not getting my parents involved because I know they\u2019ll take her side (middle kid syndrome yay me) but I\u2019m really not sure if I should keep pressing her on it or just make do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She was nice enough to let you use one and to continue to ask to be given one is too much. It's not up to her to figure something out for you. Just be happy that she's just letting you use one at all. It seems like you're going through a bad patch but that does not make you entitled to one of her computers.", "YTA. Just use the computer the way she said or go without. If you want to go without, go to the public library.", "NAH these computers are hers so she does what she wants with them but she should understand the importance of your studies, I also wonder what these 3 computers are for h", "This ^", "I totally get what you mean, I guess I didn\u2019t realise how different Mac and Windows laptops are - when I was in school I transferred stuff to different Windows run laptops all the time but I\u2019ve never even used a Mac before. I guess it must be pretty different. As for my own laptop, I\u2019ll say that I was so surprised its broken because the dent is pretty precise on the edge, and I have no idea how I did it. First physical damage in over 3 years and of course its detrimental! At this point my main concern is just the time it\u2019ll take to get repaired since I can bring up some money my parents owe me to maybe pay it off, but with the tension of my sister being mad at the whole situation they might just feed off that energy and refuse to help.", "Sorry I didn\u2019t clarify, but the one she offered me is the latest Macbook she got, which is almost a year old. Her first Macbook is around 3 years old? Her gaming PC is a huge unit rooted in her room, which I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch in a million years. The whole reason I wanted a separate account was so she wouldn\u2019t be concerned about me messing with her files or anything, but other than it being the school computer she says that you need like 15 gbs just to make a new account. I honestly really don\u2019t know anything about Macbooks since I\u2019ve never used one, but it just seems weird that other accounts on my laptop didnt have that kind of storage requirement. If I\u2019m wrong tho please tell me!", "There\u2019s a big difference in the sister being 16 and paying for her EDUCATION and OP being 21 and expecting the parents to pay for her lack of responsibility", "16 year old has 3 computers and they are all in WORKING a condition and ones even multiple years old and still running, OP (adult) had 1 computer and couldn\u2019t even look after that but yeah the sisters a brat", "She has a Maacbook that's her personal laptop. A pc (most likely windows that the sibling doesn't want) and a MacBook for school.\n\nAs someone in it 100% that one with the school login is locked out of alot of features because the school isn't going to risk their cybersecurity meaning the sibling had no freedom on it. This is the one she offered her sister so her restrictions make sense as those are restrictions the school probably places on what they view as part of their network.", "It's probably not a manufacturing thing. It's likely a policy thing. \n\nI work in IT, and I have noticed that a few years ago we didn't used to lock computers out of putting files on the hard drive, using USB drives, and in some cases even installing programs. Since cybersecurity has become a bigger concern to places, they are starting to lock down many more functions that could potentially be vulnerable. \n\nLike at my company we have windows laptops, but employees wouldn't be able to just move files from the hard drive to a USB or anything. They sign in with their company account and everything gets saved in cloud storage.", "It\u2019s probably the type of account that uses up the storage, not the fact that the computer is a Mac."]}
