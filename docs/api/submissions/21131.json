For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019ll call him Luke. I met Luke in college and we have been fairly close friends ever since. I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s my closest friend, but we\u2019re close enough to where he invited me to his birthday party. \n\nHe knows a decent bit about my history, but i really don\u2019t like to talk about my past that much. I won\u2019t get into the details but i do suffer from PTSD and used to cope with drugs. To put the entire story into a super oversimplified sentence: my dad is a dick and I used to have a coke problem. However, I can say that I am now completely sober and have been for a year. Luke doesn\u2019t know all the details of my past, but he does know that i used to be an addict. \n\nI hadn\u2019t had any close calls for a while until last night when i went to Luke\u2019s birthday party. I was told it would be a \u201csmall hangout\u201d but when arrived, it was a *party.* probably 30-40 people at the peak, loud music, and enough alcohol to feed a village. Luke was always the type of guy who liked parties, so this wasn\u2019t a huge shock. Everything was fine for the first part of the night, That was until i saw out of the corner of my eye, some people, including Luke, sitting around a table doing lines. The whole party was starting to gravitate in that direction, and i could tell that this was about to become the sole focus of the rest of the night. \n\nNow i want to clarify, i have no issue if those people want to partake in that. Do whatever you want, it\u2019s your funeral. What i did have a problem with, was my \u201cfriend\u201d, inviting me to his party knowing damn well that there was going to be drugs and that I was a recovering addict. I had managed to stay clean for so long, and it was literally a few feet away from me. This was my worst nightmare. \n\nI blew up at him, I pulled him to the side and screamed at how stupid he was and how shitty it was of him to do this to his supposed \u201cfriend.\u201d My screaming drew the attention of a lot of the crowd and Luke looked horribly embarrassed, but i stormed out before he could respond to me. \n\nI went home, and went to bed, but when I woke up i had a catalogue of texts from Luke saying how he didn\u2019t think it would have mattered to me because i had been sober for so long, and that regardless it was out of line for me to explode like that because it \u201cruined his birthday.\u201d He keeps saying that if i didn\u2019t like it, i \u201cshould have just left and not made my addiction everyone else\u2019s problem.\u201d \n\nto me, it felt like a huge violation of trust. I had confided in him that i had drug problems and he failed to consider me or even warn me beforehand that this would be happening at his party. I haven\u2019t responded to anything he has said yet but I am still absolutely pissed at him.  \n\nso, AITA for yelling at my friend at his birthday party?\n\nEdit: someone advised me to add this- Luke is the one who brought the coke.

From now on I would suggest you ask people if there will be drugs at a party prior to attending them, rather than assume things due to your personal history. However, even if there wasn\u2019t a spoken plan for someone to bring it yet a guest did, that\u2019s an added bonus for lots of people and still acceptable if that\u2019s what they want to do.

Parties can involve drugs. You could easily have just pulled him aside and politely told him that you were leaving early as the drugs were still an issue and you didn't want to be tempted. He's almost certainly have been cool with it and you could move on. You don't even know if the drugs were pre-planned or if someone brought them and it just became a thing in the moment. You can't go around screaming at people just because they're doing something you can't/struggle with, it's on you to remove yourself from the situation. You were a dick about it.

Jettison him; I did most of my old friends due to the same crass inconsiderate behavior. \n\nTo those who are saying yta, you obviously have never really dealt with addiction or with someone close to you being addicted. All it takes is one slip, and you are in worse than before, down a hole that never lets up. It is an hourly battle that you have to fight. You have to choose your spaces and subject matter with care. Yeah, even movies and all that. Because that one drink or one line is all it takes. I battled with alcoholism for years. Up and down, my life is finally flowing along the lines I needed it to.

You also could have just removed yourself from the situation as soon as you saw what was going on.", "NTA. I do agree with the comments on here saying that it's your responsibility to manage your addiction, but if he was actually a good friend he wouldn't have put you in this situation in the first place. If he was more of an acquaintance, I would say you overreacted, but if he is really a close friend he sould have told you there would be drugs at the party.

No more issue. Ignorant and naive. But not everyone understands the complexities of addiction and that you will always be in recovery. \n\nHe fucked up first for sure. But you made it worse.", "YTA\n\nit is not anybody else\u2019s job to keep you sober. It is your job.

Your issue will be there forever - you cannot \"scream\" at people whenever you encounter it. You will not get warning for future exposures, so you need to start dealing with it and managing it.\n\nIf \"Luke\" had to cater for everyone's issues and PTSD at his party, then I imagine it wouldn't be fun for anyone.\n\nGood luck, I hope you are OK.\n\nEDIT: Typo", "Ugh YTA obviously, congratulations on being sober , but you\u2019re a grown man and you need to learn how to remove yourself from triggering situations without making your problem everyone else\u2019s too.

I don't really think anyone is fully an AH here TBH, unfortunately people are IGNORANT around addiction, as in uneducated.

You said in your post, 'used to be addict' how about phrasing it to be people moving forward as 'I am an addict', just because you're in recovery doesn't mean you're no longer an addict. I think this whole story proves that point. It's for life OP. I really hope you have a sponsor or some kind of support group that could help you process this situation and move forward-whether that's with your friend in your life or not. Before letting go of this friendship though I do think you should sit down and have an honest heart to heart, and then youll know if he's a good friend for you by how he is in the future regarding this stuff. In my experience however with any addicts in my life, sober people need sober friends. Maybe joining a sports or walking group, or finding a hobby could help you find people on your wavelength (I know nothing about you, just clutching at straws now).\n\nEither way I don't think you handled the situation well but I've no idea how it must have felt.

Ignorant or something ??? 1 year is \"a long time\"?! There's people that relapse after 10 years. Relapses happen and people need to be more understanding of what a fight for sobriety really means when it comes to addiction. A friend of mine had to cut off all his old friendships because they did not take him or his addiction seriously, and would continuously cross his boundaries.\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. I hope you can join a meeting or call someone more understanding. You deserve people in your life who value you and do not put you in harm's way.", "YTA your past addiction doesn\u2019t determine what happens at your friends party.

He was drunk and coked up- the right thing to do was take him aside, say goodnight and address his thoughtlessness a day or so later when he was sober. Not in the middle of the party.", "The comments are so strange. \n\nI've been to parties where people do whip out drugs like that. I'm not someone who does drugs so it makes me uncomfortable. I usually move or leave if it's getting out of hand. \n\nThe one thing I can control is if I stay at a party, I can't control if people drink, do drugs or anything at their party. \n\nI think your reaction is over the top. If you knew you still need to be careful with your sobriety and you consider Luke a friend you should have just asked if they're doing  drugs. \n\nHe assumed you were sober and that as a result you wouldn't have issues being around it. Based on that alone you'd assume he just wasn't aware, especially because his reaction suggests that. He's not an addict, if you've never told him you can't be around people using. He probably has assumed that you're sober so being around people who aren't doesn't impact you.", "YTA obviously.  Who died and made you the morality police?  Hopefully Luke wises up and ditches your main character ass.", "NTA. What kind of friend invites someone they know has struggled with addiction before? I can't believe people are defending OP's \"friend\". Yeah sure screaming at him was probably embarrassing for him but the friend was definitely being shitty and dismissive.

For a normal person, sure.\n\nFor PTSD and addiction?  Normal responses are not applicable.", "Looking at the edit, NTA.\n\nIf he knew you were a recovering _coke_ addict, why the fuck did he invite you in the first place??? Why didn\u2019t he bother to mention \u201coh yeah btw there\u2019s a strong chance there\u2019ll be coke\u201d.\n\nSure, was it a slightly AH move to shout at him in the moment? Yeah, but then again I don\u2019t blame you\u2013 coke is not a typical product at a party, you don\u2019t rock up to a kid\u2019s birthday or even an adult\u2019s birthday and _boom!_ there\u2019s coke. Feels like he\u2019s just ignorant at best and downright actively trying to ruin your sobriety at worst. A recover*ing* is different to a recover*ed* addict.\n\nOn the other hand, it is definitely down to you, at the end of the day, to manage your sobriety. But that is surely not helped by placing the addictive substance essentially in front of you.", "NTA", "NTA. Basing this off your update that he brought the coke himself.

He knowingly put you in a situation where you could have relapsed and that could have seriously messed up your life.

Apologize to your friend but also have a conversation about your boundaries.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nThe moment you'd seen the blow you should have left, your sobriety is your responsibility.

To be frank as soon as you start yelling at myself or a guest in my house your ass would have been kicked out.", "YTA. You should have turned around and left immediately. Confronting him after the event would have been fine, but you put yourself at risk by staying around drugs for longer than you needed to.", "YTA, just because you\u2019re an ex addict doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to tip toe around you, you were free to leave if you didn\u2019t like the fact they were taking drugs you were not forced to stay there.", "I would have definitely included the Luke brought it in your original post, it was good that you edited it, and I really hope a lot of the YTA votes are from before you did that. (Though his response to the fact that you have been sober for a year is a BATSHIT thing to say, so i still think there is an issue with those votes frankly.) I agree that if he hadn't brought it to the party l, it would have been Y T A. Parties sometimes have drugs, and that is a thing that unfortunately addicts have to deal with. I can go into a whole thing on the problematic nature of how we utilize and consider what is and what isn't a drug in this country, how addiction is caused and treated, etc. In all of this, but that is another conversation.\n\nBut the fact he brought the drugs AND invited you AND knew of your past history makes you NTA.

That is an asshole thing to do.", "NTA. I'm appalled at the ytas. It doesn't matter what kind of event. A true friend would have given you a heads up and allowed OP to make the choice to attend.

He could have been a little more respectful of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish by getting clean. \n\nTrust me it gets easier but those cravings may never go away~ 3 years as of April.", "Esh", "ESH.  Your response was way out of line and deserves an acknowledgement and apology without any excuses.  \n\nLike was rude not to mention that to you.

You just leave.", "Don't understand why everyone here's treating cocaine like it's no big deal and that Luke isn't as AH for bringing it around a recovering addict?? Ofc NTA it's frankly insane to me to say otherwise", "Yta. One of the things they talked about in treatment when i went was that you cannot control others, you can only control your own actions. In this case you should have just left and taken yourself out of the situation. If it was still bothering you after the fact you could have talked to him about it one on one the next day.", "YTA. You should have quietly exited when you saw the drugs and addressed it with your friend later on the week. People may know you were an addict and people may know drugs were going to be there. But it's not their responsibility to babysit you or build a 40+ person party to your specific needs. It's not great, what happened, but you can't blame your friend for celebrating. Addicts gotta understand, most of us do not get where you are coming from.", "NTA, he\u2019s shown how mature he is by his reaction and it\u2019s not at all.  Someone close to you like that who knows your story should be more considerate ahead of time and let you know especially when they\u2019re the ones who brought the coke.

About the party, yeah you could\u2019ve just left and spoken to Luke later. That probably would have been best. BUT I want to make this clear, as someone who watched a loved one battle alcoholism, loved ones DO NOT shove your addiction substance in your face and expect you to smile and wave. If I was throwing a party with free-flowing alcohol, I\u2019d make sure the alcoholics knew it would be present and if the couldn\u2019t come, that I understood. Same goes for drugs. It takes time for people to develop coping strategies for dealing with their abuse substance irl settings. And there are plenty of addicts who never do \u2014 the only coping mechanism for them is to avoid it like the plague. And if that\u2019s what you need to do, do it. Because you deserve to live a long, healthy life. And finally, I\u2019d just like to point out that unlike alcohol or weed in some jurisdictions, coke is 100% very illegal. Do you really want to risk your sobriety, your very freedom, and mental health recovery by hanging with whole groups of friends that do coke, even if it\u2019s just recreationally? \n\nYou need new, coke-free friends. \n\nNTA.

Your post was a little confusing because you said he knows some things about your past but not everything. To me, that comes off as he knew you had an addiction, but maybe not to coke in particular? I have lots of friends that are in recovery, but I couldn't specifically name what all they were addicted to. \n\nEven if he did know specifically, I think it would have been better to just leave. Clearly, Luke is not well versed or understanding as to why this is an issue for you. It could simply be a gap in his knowledge. By the way he initially reacted, it seems to me that he was clueless about how wrong it was. If you still want to maintain this friendship, then maybe just explain why you went off on  him. Tell him that you need his behavior to be different going forward. If he can do that, great. If not, then he wasn't that great of a friend.", "Check OP\u2019s comments.

OP has only been clean for a year, it isn't really that long - and I am absolutely not discounting their sobriety, I'm just saying that I would think that it's still a huge adjustment at that stage.

If you\u2019ve never heard of Luke doing it before then it\u2019s possible he started it in the time since you became sober and he didn\u2019t want to discuss it with you, but a group sitting around a table in the middle of a party that can be easily seen, so not sound like a group doing it for the first or second time. You also stated in your post that you don\u2019t open up to people. Yes Luke knows you had an addiction, but unless he himself has overcome addiction in the past he can\u2019t imagine what a struggle it is for you, and many recovering alcoholics for example can be around people drinking wine or being in a bar etc when they feel comfortable. Luke also might not realize you don\u2019t know he does it, and unless you specifically asked would there be drugs, he might have just assumed you would know they could potentially be there and were comfortable with the possibility. Unfortunately if we don\u2019t open up to the people around us and let them really know how we\u2019re doing, their going to think things are ok, and people also have their own things going on too that we won\u2019t always know about.", "He did know it was coke. As i mentioned we met in college, so he knew me while i was in the middle of it- thought he never knew at the time. When i finally did open up to him a few years later it\u2019s cause i was considering relapse and just needed someone to talk go because my boyfriend was out of town. I told him i had a coke problem, and then we moved on and just tried to keep me distracted. \n\nApart from that, we didn\u2019t talk about it much.
