For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019ll call him Luke. I met Luke in college and we have been fairly close friends ever since. I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s my closest friend, but we\u2019re close enough to where he invited me to his birthday party. \n\nHe knows a decent bit about my history, but i really don\u2019t like to talk about my past that much. I won\u2019t get into the details but i do suffer from PTSD and used to cope with drugs. To put the entire story into a super oversimplified sentence: my dad is a dick and I used to have a coke problem. However, I can say that I am now completely sober and have been for a year. Luke doesn\u2019t know all the details of my past, but he does know that i used to be an addict. \n\nI hadn\u2019t had any close calls for a while until last night when i went to Luke\u2019s birthday party. I was told it would be a \u201csmall hangout\u201d but when arrived, it was a *party.* probably 30-40 people at the peak, loud music, and enough alcohol to feed a village. Luke was always the type of guy who liked parties, so this wasn\u2019t a huge shock. Everything was fine for the first part of the night, That was until i saw out of the corner of my eye, some people, including Luke, sitting around a table doing lines. The whole party was starting to gravitate in that direction, and i could tell that this was about to become the sole focus of the rest of the night. \n\nNow i want to clarify, i have no issue if those people want to partake in that. Do whatever you want, it\u2019s your funeral. What i did have a problem with, was my \u201cfriend\u201d, inviting me to his party knowing damn well that there was going to be drugs and that I was a recovering addict. I had managed to stay clean for so long, and it was literally a few feet away from me. This was my worst nightmare. \n\nI blew up at him, I pulled him to the side and screamed at how stupid he was and how shitty it was of him to do this to his supposed \u201cfriend.\u201d My screaming drew the attention of a lot of the crowd and Luke looked horribly embarrassed, but i stormed out before he could respond to me. \n\nI went home, and went to bed, but when I woke up i had a catalogue of texts from Luke saying how he didn\u2019t think it would have mattered to me because i had been sober for so long, and that regardless it was out of line for me to explode like that because it \u201cruined his birthday.\u201d He keeps saying that if i didn\u2019t like it, i \u201cshould have just left and not made my addiction everyone else\u2019s problem.\u201d \n\nto me, it felt like a huge violation of trust. I had confided in him that i had drug problems and he failed to consider me or even warn me beforehand that this would be happening at his party. I haven\u2019t responded to anything he has said yet but I am still absolutely pissed at him.  \n\nso, AITA for yelling at my friend at his birthday party?\n\n\nEdit: someone advised me to add this- Luke is the one who brought the coke. I saw him pull it out of his own backpack and pass it around the table.\n\n\nEdit 2: Hey, just wanted to say thanks for all the verdicts and opinions. Unfortunately, in light of the events discussed in this post and all the discussion happening in this thread I\u2019ve had some dangerous thoughts resurfacing so i am going to log off for a bit for my own safety. I am planning to reach out to Luke in the coming days to try and clear the air but i do not intend to continue to remain being around him.

From now on I would suggest you ask people if there will be drugs at a party prior to attending them, rather than assume things due to your personal history. However, even if there wasn\u2019t a spoken plan for someone to bring it yet a guest did, that\u2019s an added bonus for lots of people and still acceptable if that\u2019s what they want to do.

All it takes is one slip, and you are in worse than before, down a hole that never lets up. It is an hourly battle that you have to fight. You have to choose your spaces and subject matter with care. Yeah, even movies and all that. Because that one drink or one line is all it takes. I battled with alcoholism for years. Up and down, my life is finally flowing along the lines I needed it to.

Your issue will be there forever - you cannot \"scream\" at people whenever you encounter it.

You said in your post, 'used to be addict' how about phrasing it to be people moving forward as 'I am an addict', just because you're in recovery doesn't mean you're no longer an addict. I think this whole story proves that point. It's for life OP. I really hope you have a sponsor or some kind of support group that could help you process this situation and move forward-whether that's with your friend in your life or not. Before letting go of this friendship though I do think you should sit down and have an honest heart to heart, and then youll know if he's a good friend for you by how he is in the future regarding this stuff. In my experience however with any addicts in my life, sober people need sober friends. Maybe joining a sports or walking group, or finding a hobby could help you find people on your wavelength (I know nothing about you, just clutching at straws now).\n\nEither way I don't think you handled the situation well but I've no idea how it must have felt.

Ignorant or something ??? 1 year is \"a long time\"?! There's people that relapse after 10 years. Relapses happen and people need to be more understanding of what a fight for sobriety really means when it comes to addiction. A friend of mine had to cut off all his old friendships because they did not take him or his addiction seriously, and would continuously cross his boundaries.\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. I hope you can join a meeting or call someone more understanding.

I hope you continue that way. \n\nLuke should have been more mindful of your sobriety. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that he wasn\u2019t, given he doesn\u2019t know the details and in honesty most people don\u2019t know much about it unless they go through the process or support someone else through it, neither of which is the case here. He was thoughtless of you. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have made a scene. He was drunk and coked up- the right thing to do was take him aside, say goodnight and address his thoughtlessness a day or so later when he was sober. Not in the middle of the party.", "The comments are so strange. \n\nI've been to parties where people do whip out drugs like that. I'm not someone who does drugs so it makes me uncomfortable. I usually move or leave if it's getting out of hand. \n\nThe one thing I can control is if I stay at a party, I can't control if people drink, do drugs or anything at their party. \n\nI think your reaction is over the top. If you knew you still need to be careful with your sobriety and you consider Luke a friend you should have just asked if they're doing  drugs. \n\nHe assumed you were sober and that as a result you wouldn't have issues being around it. Based on that alone you'd assume he just wasn't aware, especially because his reaction suggests that. He's not an addict, if you've never told him you can't be around people using. He probably has assumed that you're sober so being around people who aren't doesn't impact you.", "YTA obviously.  Who died and made you the morality police?  Hopefully Luke wises up and ditches your main character ass.", "NTA. What kind of friend invites someone they know has struggled with addiction before? I can't believe people are defending OP's \"friend\". Yeah sure screaming at him was probably embarrassing for him but the friend was definitely being shitty and dismissive. Anyone with a brain cell knows that being sober does not mean it gets easier or that the person can never be triggered", "NTA because he knew your history and not only did he not inform you but provided drugs.

For a normal person, sure.\n\nFor PTSD and addiction?  Normal responses are not applicable.", "Looking at the edit, NTA.\n\nIf he knew you were a recovering _coke_ addict, why the fuck did he invite you in the first place??? Why didn\u2019t he bother to mention \u201coh yeah btw there\u2019s a strong chance there\u2019ll be coke\u201d.\n\nSure, was it a slightly AH move to shout at him in the moment? Yeah, but then again I don\u2019t blame you\u2013 coke is not a typical product at a party, you don\u2019t rock up to a kid\u2019s birthday or even an adult\u2019s birthday and _boom!_ there\u2019s coke. Feels like he\u2019s just ignorant at best and downright actively trying to ruin your sobriety at worst. A recover*ing* is different to a recover*ed* addict.\n\nOn the other hand, it is definitely down to you, at the end of the day, to manage your sobriety. But that is surely not helped by placing the addictive substance essentially in front of you.", "NTA", "NTA. Basing this off your update that he brought the coke himself.

He knowingly put you in a situation where you could have relapsed and that could have seriously messed up your life.

Apologize to your friend but also have a conversation about your boundaries.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nThe moment you'd seen the blow you should have left, your sobriety is your responsibility. Luke can't consider the struggles of 40 people at once, and if it became 39 it would have just been his birthday still.

To be frank as soon as you start yelling at myself or a guest in my house your ass would have been kicked out.", "YTA. You should have turned around and left immediately. Confronting him after the event would have been fine, but you put yourself at risk by staying around drugs for longer than you needed to.", "YTA, just because you\u2019re an ex addict doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to tip toe around you, you were free to leave if you didn\u2019t like the fact they were taking drugs you were not forced to stay there.", "I would have definitely included the Luke brought it in your original post, it was good that you edited it, and I really hope a lot of the YTA votes are from before you did that. (Though his response to the fact that you have been sober for a year is a BATSHIT thing to say, so i still think there is an issue with those votes frankly.) I agree that if he hadn't brought it to the party l, it would have been Y T A. Parties sometimes have drugs, and that is a thing that unfortunately addicts have to deal with. I can go into a whole thing on the problematic nature of how we utilize and consider what is and what isn't a drug in this country, how addiction is caused and treated, etc. In all of this, but that is another conversation.\n\nBut the fact he brought the drugs AND invited you AND knew of your past history makes you NTA.

That is an asshole thing to do.", "NTA. I'm appalled at the ytas. It doesn't matter what kind of event. A true friend would have given you a heads up and allowed OP to make the choice to attend.

As Luke KNEW there were gonna be drugs (he brought them himself) he should've told you beforehand. He might've thought it wasn't gonna be a big deal, but to expect that of a recovering addict is not it.

He could have been a little more respectful of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish by getting clean. \n\nTrust me it gets easier but those cravings may never go away~ 3 years as of April.", "Esh", "ESH.  Your response was way out of line and deserves an acknowledgement and apology without any excuses.  \n\nLike was rude not to mention that to you.   I've been my AA friend a heads up if there's alcohol. \n\nBut this is more on you bc this was a big party and I'm sure you could hear that and see that when you walked in.", "YTA you should've just left quietly. Your sobriety is no one's responsibility but yours to manage", "YTA. You just leave.", "Don't understand why everyone here's treating cocaine like it's no big deal and that Luke isn't as AH for bringing it around a recovering addict?? Ofc NTA it's frankly insane to me to say otherwise", "Yta. One of the things they talked about in treatment when i went was that you cannot control others, you can only control your own actions. In this case you should have just left and taken yourself out of the situation. If it was still bothering you after the fact you could have talked to him about it one on one the next day.", "YTA. You should have quietly exited when you saw the drugs and addressed it with your friend later on the week. People may know you were an addict and people may know drugs were going to be there. But it's not their responsibility to babysit you or build a 40+ person party to your specific needs. It's not great, what happened, but you can't blame your friend for celebrating. Addicts gotta understand, most of us do not get where you are coming from.", "NTA, he\u2019s shown how mature he is by his reaction and it\u2019s not at all.  Someone close to you like that who knows your story should be more considerate ahead of time and let you know especially when they\u2019re the ones who brought the coke.

About the party, yeah you could\u2019ve just left and spoken to Luke later. That probably would have been best. BUT I want to make this clear, as someone who watched a loved one battle alcoholism, loved ones DO NOT shove your addiction substance in your face and expect you to smile and wave. If I was throwing a party with free-flowing alcohol, I\u2019d make sure the alcoholics knew it would be present and if the couldn\u2019t come, that I understood. Same goes for drugs. It takes time for people to develop coping strategies for dealing with their abuse substance irl settings. And there are plenty of addicts who never do \u2014 the only coping mechanism for them is to avoid it like the plague. And if that\u2019s what you need to do, do it. Because you deserve to live a long, healthy life. And finally, I\u2019d just like to point out that unlike alcohol or weed in some jurisdictions, coke is 100% very illegal. Do you really want to risk your sobriety, your very freedom, and mental health recovery by hanging with whole groups of friends that do coke, even if it\u2019s just recreationally? \n\nYou need new, coke-free friends. \n\nNTA.

Your post was a little confusing because you said he knows some things about your past but not everything. To me, that comes off as he knew you had an addiction, but maybe not to coke in particular? I have lots of friends that are in recovery, but I couldn't specifically name what all they were addicted to. \n\nEven if he did know specifically, I think it would have been better to just leave. Clearly, Luke is not well versed or understanding as to why this is an issue for you. It could simply be a gap in his knowledge. By the way he initially reacted, it seems to me that he was clueless about how wrong it was. If you still want to maintain this friendship, then maybe just explain why you went off on  him. Tell him that you need his behavior to be different going forward. If he can do that, great. If not, then he wasn't that great of a friend.", "Check OP\u2019s comments.

You also stated in your post that you don\u2019t open up to people. Yes Luke knows you had an addiction, but unless he himself has overcome addiction in the past he can\u2019t imagine what a struggle it is for you, and many recovering alcoholics for example can be around people drinking wine or being in a bar etc when they feel comfortable. Luke also might not realize you don\u2019t know he does it, and unless you specifically asked would there be drugs, he might have just assumed you would know they could potentially be there and were comfortable with the possibility. Unfortunately if we don\u2019t open up to the people around us and let them really know how we\u2019re doing, their going to think things are ok, and people also have their own things going on too that we won\u2019t always know about.", "[deleted]", "Yeah a lot of the bigger parties that I\u2019ve attended had separate rooms like a \u201cpowder\u201d room and nitrous room, so that people who didn\u2019t want to didn\u2019t have to be around it. Smaller gatherings are different, especially since we know almost everyone and what they\u2019re comfortable around", "It was convenient that OP didn\u2019t add that until after getting all the comments about how they are in the wrong. I simply don\u2019t believe that Luke supplied coke for the party. If he did pull some out, it\u2019s likely that he was contributing to a stash of coke that other\u2019s brought.

That isn't an overly onerous ask.  \n\nAnd the thing about you being clean long enough to resist is ignorant af. You're still so early in your recovery. \n\nNow it IS true that you are responsible for your OWN recovery. However, friends who want to remain in your life need to respect your sobriety, and it is absolutely within your rights to avoid people who will not respect it or be up front about what kind of environment you're walking into so you can make educated decisions about your own exposure. \n\nBut blowing up the way you did was excessive. \n\nHe should have warned you. You should have reacted more rationally.  Next time, just leave. It's not worth risking everything you've worked for. \n\nIf you want to try to preserve this friendship, sit down with him and have a talk about this stuff.  Determine what your boundaries are and what you are and are not cool with. He needs to know what you need, and you need to know what he's willing to do. With full honesty on both sides.  If he cannot or will not abide by the boundaries that you require to maintain your recovery, I don't see the friendship being worth preserving for either of you.  \n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean he's TA, as it depends on what you're asking of him. But it ultimately doesn't matter who's the asshole if you're just not able to meet somewhere that works for both of you.\n\nBeing in recovery changes a lot. People end up with completely new friend groups because their lifestyles change so much.  You may find that the people who met your friendship needs while you were using are no longer right for your new life. And that's ok. \n\nYou also might find plenty of them DO manage to fit into your new life.  But it's kind of a case by case thing and you'll need to be vigilant about it. People often underestimate the seriousness of addiction and recovery, and often willfully because it suits them to think it's no big deal so it won't ruin their fun. Those people are dangerous to you. \n\nBest of luck. I'm proud of you.", "Yes YTA. Well done for being sober but you should have just left and there was no need to make a big scene and ruin his birthday. This will happen again and again in your life. Are you going to go nuclear every time?", "Esh. He is right, your triggers are not his problem. NA has great tools to help you through them. \n\nBut I have a lot of recovering alcoholics in my life and I always warn before hand if there will be alcohol. If I'm eating out with someone, I ask if they will be OK if I order a drink. It's not hard to be kind to people we claim to care about.", "ESH You shouldn't have screamed at Luke, you could've just left and discuss it the next day with him in private. However he is a huge ah for not being honest about the size of the party and about his intentions of bringing to the party the very drug you were addicted to without giving you at the very least a warning", "Yta. Your recovery and sobriety is your issue not those around you. There is also a difference in supporting you and coddling you. I\u2019m glad you hit clean and you should be proud.", "YTA He was a moron, but it's his birthday party and you ruined it. Your addiction and past is nobody's problem but yours, and you seriously need to learn to cope with it", "YTA. Your problems are not his problems. You went to a big party and there were people doing drugs. Are you going to do this every time you go to a big party? You are the problem, not the people doing drugs. You need to get hold of yourself and act like an adult, not a pathetic child.", "YTA. That\u2019s a \u2018you\u2019 thing. And it\u2019s commendable that you\u2019re sober but that\u2019s your responsibility and nobody else\u2019s. In this context he did nothing wrong. If he invited just you over and started doing this I\u2019d find more fault with him. A big party is just a place where this happens.", "Holy fucking shit. The people calling you the problem are awful human beings. \n\nNot only did this friend know about your past, knew there was going to be an illicit substance (which is not at all common like other commenters are saying), and brought it himself???? The least he could've done is give you a heads up since he knew he was actively going to bring coke. \n\nDump him as a friend, the fact that he didn't tell you there was going to be coke there makes me suspicious that he either doesn't know the extent of addiction and it's repercussions or more maliciously, HE WAS TRYING TO SABOTAGE YOUR SOBRIETY. \n\nOne million times NTA. Please OP do not listen to the other verdicts. You were right to confront your friend in the moment, after all, he didn't mind doing coke in front of you, why should you care about his party. Stay away from him, him not telling you makes me worried that he himself has drug issues and is trying to drag those around him with him. NTA NTA NTA NTA.", "NTA, and everyone else saying otherwise is probably a bad friend who has no consideration and empathy for other people. You should cut Luke out of your life for being a cokehead. When you're in recovery, the last thing you need is your old life trying to drag you back, you should start fresh", "Unpopular opinion and I don't care...but NTA. Coke sucks. It's sh*t. My dad did it for a long time and could be very unpredictable, and I've been through hell with my boyfriend doing it (he can't anymore because of his heart. He's not mean it just messes with his health). It always ruins the night. When people do it here. I'm proud of you for not touching it. That has to have been hard. Stay strong and stay clean \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nOkay maybe you shouldn't have screamed at him but you felt how you felt. It's almost like a trigger. And I don't think it's fair. They couldn't go in the bathroom?! Or he couldn't have warned you that people might be doing it? Who cares about a birthday your friendship should be more important.  He could have done that anywhere else but where you were at. I respect my friends who are trying to get clean and don't even smoke reefer around them (which is literally the only thing I'll touch). Not to mention it's not safe to do C anymore because it's so often laced with fentanyl now (which has killed off many of our friends). Maybe it's time to find new friends. To stay safe.", "NTA. He should have told you.", "I feel like all these N T A votes are from people who don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own problems. YOU are the one with the drug problem and your recovery is YOUR responsibility. You could have easily left and communicated that you would have appreciated a heads up. It would have been thoughtful of him, but he does not owe you that. YTA for trying to make your problems someone else\u2019s.", "YTA. Especially based on your edit. You knew Luke did drugs, you should\u2019ve anticipated it. The world is not going to stop for your recovery. This sounds harsh, but that\u2019s what life is. \n\nCongrats on getting sober, but your sobriety is in your hands. Keep on it, and good luck.", "Remember, people who use drugs aren\u2019t thinking clearly. You had the reaction, now look to yourself to review that\u2026no one can take care of you, but you. My purpose for saying this is it may happen again, that you find yourself in a social setting that is uncomfortable-how will you respond? Consider walking through that in advance to have some exit strategies. As for your friend, yeah, not very thoughtful, but how much can you expect from someone who is making dicey decisions?", "ESH\n\nMaybe get some sober friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, it's an asshole move to invite someone in recovery to a coke fueled binge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut next time instead of yelling... just leave. And talk to him the next day when you are calmer and he isn't high.", "ESH Yes, Luke was a huge asshole for throwing a party like that and not giving you a warning. He could easily have done that when he invited you. OTOH, maybe he didn't plan it that way and someone else brought the drugs as a gift for his party. Then he couldn't have warned you. Either way, you should have just left instead of making a big scene. Your drug addiction is your problem and your sobriety is yours to protect. Just as an alcoholic has no right to expect their friends and family to stop drinking at family parties and things like weddings and birthday parties to make it easier on them, neither do you have that right. \n\nI would recommend making Luke an ex friend so you aren't tempted again by hanging out with him.", "NAH. You reacted from the gut about a life changing situation.  I don\u2019t fault you for that and a good friend wouldn\u2019t. But it can\u2019t be your default when confronted with this scenario. You need a better coping response and should discuss it in therapy. \n\nThe only reason I am saying NAH for Luke is perhaps he didn\u2019t realise the severity of your addiction and is still of an age where birthday party = party drugs. \n\nAll the best with your journey of sobriety. I hope you and Luke can sort this out.", "ESH.  Luke should have warned you there\u2019d be drugs at the party, since he knew about your sobriety.  However, people who haven\u2019t experienced addiction and recovery often have no idea how triggering situations like this can be. You should have removed yourself from the party once you became aware of the issue, not screamed at your host during his birthday.", "I\u2019m only going with YTA because you blew up at Luke. All you had to do was leave and shoot a text saying \u201cplease warn me in advance if you invite me anywhere with drugs.\u201d\n\nI agree Luke wasn\u2019t that great of a friend to you but there was no reason for you to scream at him.", "I get that this sucked for you, but I\u2019m sorry I think YTA. You\u2019re kind of acting like you should be the main character in someone else\u2019s show, when it just wasn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s not up to other people to consider everyone else on that level. Your friend had 30 or more people there, and while it might have been more considerate of him to tell you there would be coke, it wasn\u2019t his job to manage everyone else\u2019s potential triggers.", "YTA, your friend is right and you're one of the many people now that actively seek out making your problem everyone else's. If you had an issue, you could've left and let him know afterwards you why you felt uncomfortable and made an impromptu exit. You didn't even have to stay longer to talk to him, yet you stayed anyway and continued to expose yourself to that atmosphere so you could make a scene. The world is not about you, you are not the main character, and not everyone has to tip-toe around your sensibilities.", "YTA all you had to do was leave that\u2019s it. It was not your place to blow up and yell at the host at his own party.", "YTA. The responsibility to stay clean is 100% on you. It\u2019s not his job to help you manage your addiction. You need to take personal responsibility and say no. \n\nYou owe Luke an apology.", "NTA: for the following reasons 1) I will never invite a recovering addict if I knew there will be drugs. People think if you recover you can be just calm and talk normal to someone if they invited you to do drugs. No, it triggers a panic in some.\n\n2) When the OP saw the drugs it probably made him remember bad memories associated with it. We didn\u2019t know how big the damage has been done for a recovering addict. If I were in the situation, I might not shout at Luke but probably block him out of my life for good.\n\nHe was a bad friend and I dont care if it\u2019s his birthday. Just because it\u2019s your day, you have the license not to be a good person, big NO.", "YTA. You\u2019re responsible for your triggers. No one else. Also, if you\u2019re still hanging out with the same group of friends you did while you were using, is this situation really a surprise? You\u2019re still early into your sobriety, but these are landmines it\u2019s up to you to avoid - even people close to you are not going to be thinking of your sobriety first when they\u2019re at a party. \n\nYou could have just left when the coke came out, and explained how you felt later to Luke. Instead you screamed at him for partying\u2026 at his own party.", "I dont know \n\nKinda ESH \n\nAnd I think doing coke is asshole behaviour cause its also illegal???", "YTA. The world doesn't revolve around you", "This is a tricky situation.  I got sober several years ago and it was upsetting when I didn\u2019t get invited as people assumed I wouldn\u2019t want to be there.  In this situation, if I were you, I would have just left.  You probably would have been annoyed if you weren\u2019t invited and saw all the pics (ones without drugs), next day on social media.  I go to parties now but a few hours in when it gets louder, I leave, no big deal.", "You realize people know not to invite you to parties now, right? Because what if you were at a party and someone at the party did something that made you uncomfortable, even if it didn't make anyone else uncomfortable, you'd feel justified in causing a scene. Getting sober is great and it's great that you've let people know. You can choose not to be at parties, but now people are going to be choosing not to have you there", "ESH he certainly should have told you, you should have just left when you saw it, instead of staying around it even longer to scream at him in front of everyone. At his own party.", "ESH, but more you than Luke. While it was not cool for your friend to expose you to this, it doesn\u2019t sound like he actually tried to involve you before you started literally screaming at him (something you picked up from that dad of yours?)", "NTA\n\n*Only* because Luke was who brought the drugs and knew about your history, and he didn\u2019t give you a heads up. If someone else had brought it it\u2019d put you into AH territory, but he was a bad friend for bringing drugs around you and not telling you before so you could make a decision for yourself about attending", "NTA. Good friends are considerate of their friends\u2019 triggers. This whole \u201cyour trigger, your responsibility\u201d shit is for strangers. If a friend knows about your triggers and cares about you, they\u2019ll give you a heads up. It doesn\u2019t mean they have to run their lives around your triggers, but they do have to let you know that they\u2019re going to do an activity that will involve your triggers SO YOU CAN MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE about whether or not to attend. Almost 30 is really old to be so inconsiderate and to be doing drugs for funsies at a party. For the sake of your sobriety, cut ties with Luke and get better friends.", "NTA. Some \u201cfriend\u201d to not at least warn you that there\u2019d likely be drugs there. Being sober for a year is a huge achievement, but it\u2019s also still a relatively new thing, and he knows this. You probably should have just left and had it out with him the next day, but I can completely understand how you lost your cool in the moment. You need friends who will support your sobriety- be that walking it with you, or at least making you aware of the possibility of there being drugs around so you can make your own choice about whether to attend", "Going with YTA\n\nYour recovery is your burden, not everybody else's.  Considering the age group, a party is pretty much certain to have drugs of some sort being used.\n\nJust say no.  You could have simply left, but, you decided to make a big scene, which is where you crossed the line.", "ESH, your reaction could've been better, and Luke should've told you he was going to have coke at the party.", "YTA, you cant expect people to sanitize reality from everything that makes you uncomfortable.", "YTA. Not for being upset but for lashing out like you did. I get emotions were running high but you could have just pulled him to the side and said something calmly or just left and confronted him later.", "YTA. It's understandable to not want to be around drugs given your addiction history, but that was absolutely no reason to shout at him in the middle of his birthday party. \n\nYou're responsible for controlling your recovery, not your friend.", "OP, disregard the Y. T. A. here. I would wager those that say it have never dealt with addiction.  This is different than alcohol because alcohol is legal and often presumed to be at gatherings.  Illegal drugs are different.  Not only did your \u201cfriend\u201d risk your sobriety, but he also risked all of you getting arrested if the authorities had been called.  Of course you were angry.  That anger was justified. \n\nNTA.  I hope this incident showed you that Luke is a toxic \u201cfriend\u201d and that you reconsider that friendship.", "Yta. Just go home and talk about it later. No need to ruin his party. Someone could have brought a surprise bag he didn\u2019t necessarily know what was going to happen.", "YTA. You could've just left but instead you yelled at your friend during the party. I assume you were frustrated with yourself and took it out on Luke", "YTA , you should\u2019ve just left. It wasn\u2019t necessary to cause a scene. You could\u2019ve talk to him about it in private later.", "YTA, you sound like a weak minded pathetic person", "Egh. \n\nThis one is hard.  But I'm going to say YTA. \n\nI know what you are going through.  I had a huge drug and alcohol problem when I was younger.  I was the main source of blow in my state for two years during my early 20s.  I was going through half an ounce a day for personal use, so had to make a lot of money to support that.  How am I still alive? I don't know.  I know that I'm on bonus time now. So I make the most of my life. \n\nI've been clean for 18 years.  I'm very open about it. All of my friends know I had a bad drug and alcohol problem.  Sometimes a new one will invite me to the bar, and I tell them thanks but I can't go because I'm an alcoholic and can't hang out at those places.  I know I'm strong enough now to resist any drug. I have a good life and know what will happen to it if I start up.  But I wouldnt' put myself in a situation that was like.  But if it happened all of a sudden I would politely leave. \n\nYou need to be open about your problems to your friends. Completely open and honest. IF you haven't told them everything then how are they to know.  Hell, most regular people don't understand.  \n\nYou also should probably avoid parties like that.  I do. I know its not good for me.  When I was younger I hated the idea of missing out on fun, so would go to parties my friends threw. I always ended up drinking and using.  Its just better to avoid those situations. There are plenty of things for you to do instead.  You just have to get into the habbit of doing them.", "YTA. No one is responsible for you but you.", "NTA. He should have not a) invited you or b) invited you and not tell you there'd be drugs around.\n\nDitch this 'friend' and stay clean dude! You're doing amazing!\n\nAlso all the people saying you're the AH - fuck them.", "YTA,  your addiction is your problem, not theirs.  See a trigger and walk away.  No need to make a scene", "I don't blame you one bit OP.  Your friend was an A-H for inviting you, and not warning you.  You need to find better friends.  Sure, maybe you shouldn't have screamed at him.  But for a \"friend\" to put you into that situation..... not considerate at all.  Dump him as a friend.\n\nFor the rest of you saying OP's an A-H for screaming, and stating he should have expected it at a party..... what the hell kind of parties do you GO to?\n\nVerdict: NTA", "NTA. I think it would have been better if you left without a scene, but have no aspersions to cast on you for it. His misbehaviour is far worse than yours. Good on you for getting yourself away from that situation and not giving up your sobriety.\n\nThis is a very selfish friend who didn't warn you of his planned activities and who cannot apologize to you now. You need better friends with more insight and consideration than this jerk.", "YTA!", "like is an AH yes, but for this specific question, YTA. what you should have done is immediately left, removed yourself from the situation, and had a separate conversation with luke 1 on 1 at a different time to express how you felt", "NTA. A year sober is an eyeblink. From what I've read of first-person accounts, it can be a neverending walk on a knife's edge to abstain. Your friend invited you, then brought coke. If someone else brought it and you blew up, maybe y t a, but not here. You need new friends.", "Recovering cocaine addict here, coming up on three years sober. I hear you when you say having your drug of choice just a few feet away from you is so triggering for your sobriety. However YTA. You stated you knew Luke liked to party and having 30-40 people you should have known immediately there were drugs there. You could have left at any point and after a year of being sober you should hopefully have some coping mechanisms to help with situations like this.\n\nIf it truly upset you then you could have waited and talked to Luke as a friend and told him how hard that party challenged your sobriety and you were happy to celebrate but in the future try to give you a heads up before hand so you can either a.) mentally prepare or b.) not go.", "NTA and you're totally in your rights to be mad at him. Personally, I would be mad at a \"friend\" if they invited me to a party and brought themselves drugs like coke, so I understand even more for someone who was an addict.", "YTA. Could you be more selfish?", "YTA as a person with 11 years clean I can say it's not about you. His party his friends . That is a you problem.", "YTA. I\u2019m in recovery so if I\u2019m going to a friend\u2019s birthday who I know is a huge partier and that\u2019s an issue for me, I plan ahead to leave if it\u2019s too much. \n\nA nicer way obviously would have been to text him the next day and just let him know you could have used a heads up or for next time so you know what you\u2019re getting into. But that doesn\u2019t excuse screaming at your friend and making a scene. Just calmly leave like an adult.", "YTA sorry but you specifically mention that Luke likes to party, so somewhere in your head you knew drugs were a possibility. \nYou did overreact, you made his party about you and shamed the people who were there and having a good time. You killed the vibe. \nYou could have pulled him aside and said hey thanks for inviting me, good to see you, but I see coke so imma head out. Or JUST LEAVE, with 30-40 people there he wouldn\u2019t have noticed.", "ESH. Luke shouldn't have invited you under the circumstances, and you should have just left.", "Agreed", "Only in this sub would someone be considered an AH for being mad their supposed \"close friend\" would invite them to a massive rager and provide a very much illegal drug to said party knowing their friend was a recovering addict, and realistically, still very much early in their journey. \n\nNTA and Luke is a Giant ah and not someone OP should continue to associate with or do so at an arms distance", "Jesus, lot of people here clearly haven't known an addict. Commenter, if you do happen to know an addict ever, don't fucking put them in situations like that, it's extremely unkind. OP's friend invited them to a place they planned to pull out their drug of choice. Coke isn't as bad as heroin, meth or alcohol I think, but it's still completely out of line for anyone to do that. I've got a sister that's probably going to die in her 50's from liver cirrhosis, and a nephew that's probably going to need to be in therapy for a few decades from seeing his mom go to bed blackout drunk with a barf bowl next to the bed as a normal way of life, along with all the other pieces that go along with that. Addiction is NOT a thing to fuck someone over on. If they manage to get out, you don't dangle the demon in front of their nose again. \n\nIt's not hard: it's fine if you've got a stable and healthy relationship with an addictive substance, but for God's sake don't casually draw a struggling friend back into it. For some substances especially, you very literally might be killing them, or severely harming them and their family. It's unbelievably unethical to just excuse the friend here in this story, it's not like someone else unexpectedly brought coke. The friend brought it themself. The friend might not have understood, since many people don't understand the severity of a struggle with addiction, but that doesn't mean what they did wasn't objectively unacceptable behavior. It's bizarre to me how many people here think what the friend did wasn't that big of a deal, I'd have thought it was common knowledge not to do that to someone. People are responsible for their own choices, but part of the problem with addiction is it severely hampers your ability to make good choices in certain circumstances.", "Idk, OP was invited there by Luke who brought the drugs himself KNOWING that OP was a recovering addict. Then assumed that 1 year was plenty. An addict is always recovering for as long as they can stay sober. NTA", "There is a difference between drinking and illegal drugs.  There is a presumption that there may be drinking at a party.  There is not a presumption that there will be illegal drug activity at a party.  NTA", "Exactly. OP is just an addict with a victim complex.", "This. YTA.", "You can be fine with other people doing it but still wants a heads up to ensure you\u2019re not around it. I think everyone saying OP could have just calmly addressed something this triggering must not have a lot of experience around addicts. He\u2019s not right to scream but it\u2019s easy to understand psychologically how he got there. If Luke let him know there was going to be coke as a heads up and he still screamed about them doing it, he\u2019d certainly be an asshole. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s yelling about them doing it themselves so much as him being exposed to it unknowingly and risking a relapse.", "Spot on. I also think that those saying OP is the AH don\u2019t understand addiction to illegal drugs.", "This is a lame take. As a recovering alcoholic, being around people drinking isn\u2019t exactly my favorite activity, but I have enough self control to not partake myself. If I found out I was intentionally excluded from basically every party ever (since alcohol is EVERYWHERE) because people assumed otherwise about my own ability to keep my shit together, that would suck.", "Yesss. I've been commenting the same this. Luke can consume whichever substances he wants but it doesn't take that much effort at all to send a text, \"hey I know you might be uncomfortable with it, but just a heads up, I'm BRINGING COKE to my birthday party\"\n\nThe fact that Luke didn't send this text tells me he either has an addiction himself and didn't want OP to educate him or that he was actively trying to sabotage his sobriety.", "No - it isn\u2019t like that at all. Alcohol is legal. There is an expectation that alcohol will be in a bar or at a party. There is not an expectation that there will be illegal drugs used openly at a party, particularly when the host knows that OP is avoiding drugs and still invites him anyway without warning.", "couldn\u2019t have said it better", "Sure, but I don\u2019t invite my sober friend out without telling them the plans are at a bar.", "This is why I think ESH. Luke clearly sucks for being so thoughtless to his supposed friend, and is not someone OP needs in his life. But OP isn't innocent here. There was nothing stopping him from simply leaving. Nothing stopping him from speaking to Luke privately later. Nothing stopping him from cutting off his friendship with Luke. But instead he chose to create a big scene.", "OP is the AH because he caused a scene when he could have just walked out.", "Ice cream and coke are very different.\n\nDid you just compare a coke addiction to being lactose intolerant?", "If he was told it was going to be kid friendly and it turned out the only kind of kid it was friendly to was Drew Barrymore then yes? OP was told small hang out, not large party with everyone doing coke.", "Are you implying he stayed just to scream?", "I froze. don\u2019t know how else to explain it. It was the first time i had come across the drug in a long ass time and every thought in my head was saying something different. Half of me wanted to run and the other half wanted to take a seat at the table. I admit I wasn\u2019t thinking rationally. I tried to fight it for a bit and just tried to stay quiet so i didn\u2019t have a panic attack, but all the fear, anger, etc. just built up and I just exploded.", "Yeah, that's kind of my thought too. \nThe second an addict gets involved, anything that could trigger them gets thrown out of the plans whenever that person is involved. That's just being polite.\n\nThis WAS friend's birthday party though, so if he wants to sit around a table with his boys and completely wreck his face and life, Yeeeeah buddy!! Happy birthday!!!", "Still the solution isn't yelling and trying to control others and the situation. \n\nYou are a generous friend, but in OP's situation, the solution is to leave. Then evaluate whether that friendship is serviceable in sobriety. Perhaps have a conversation with the friend in question to establish safe and healthy boundaries.\n\nRecovery is about controlling yourself and the things you can and relinquishing the desire to control the things you can't. It's literally what the Serenity Prayer is about.", "So? Luke **knows** it's a massive problem and a huge issue he struggled with and a pretty big betrayal on his friend's part. \n\nThis sun loves to preach how someone on the moment should've exercised infinite patience or saint level calm. But realistically, none of us would ever do that.  OP was blindsided and invited under false pretenses and had every right to be mad and call how a shitty friend who would so carelessly bring drugs around him like that and say ridiculous stuff like \"I didn't think it mattered because you had been sober for so long\" which one year isn't that long. \n\nThis is NTA. This thread will praise people for screaming at folks for far less, yet consider **this** situation the OP tah for having more of a legit reason to yell because this is a serious betrayal, and ya know, highly illegal", "There's a difference between walking out and being mad, and yelling at Luke at his own party.", "He had every right to yell at Luke when it was **Luke** who pulled the coke out of his backpack and displayed it for everyone to see. Luke is the giant gaping AH", "For real. He didn't leave at the beginning because he was there to celebrate his friends birthday. He confronted his friend and left after he saw coke at the party?? How was he supposed to know his friend (by not telling his recovering addict friend he was bringing coke) would actively try to sabotage OP's sobriety.", "Or, pull him aside and say thank for having me over but I need to head out. You can always talk over your comfort levels and expectations for a party later.", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, that was a difficult position to be in. \n\nBut hopefully this is a wake up call that you have to be prepared to handle these situations. Your sobriety is your responsibility, not other\u2019s. \n\nHave a plan, check with people before hand if necessary, quit assuming others will change their behaviors to accommodate you", "I say this as someone whose problem is alcohol. You have to get to a place where you can be around it, and you need to assume that could happen at any gathering. Alcohol is EVERYWHERE. You just have to learn to co-exist with it in the same place if you want to have any type of social life. Cocaine obviously isn't as ubiquitous, but if your friends are the types of people who party and do lines, then you should prepare yourself anytime you're with them.", "Better to yell at a buddy rather than relapse. Now you know, you really have to just leave the whole area and call your sponsor next time you see it out in the wild. Maybe call Luke and tell him you were so mad because that shit was going to kill you if you didn't stop doing it. He'll hopefully see you as less AH for it if he knows you were scared.", "He didn't try to control anyone though he just said it was fucked up not to warn him", "I disagree. I'm not saying OP was in the wrong for how he felt. But this sub is called \"am I the asshole\" and screaming at someone and causing a scene when literally anything else was an option, is a solidly asshole move.", "OP said he saw Luke take it out of his backpack", "If you don't believe the OP there is no point in even engaging with this sub. We can only go with what we are given.", "Counterpoint, why would OP be so mad if Luke was completely uninvolved with coke being at the party. People forget to add things and there\u2019s a character limit for the OP, people add things all the time. If we all assume OP edits are always lies then what\u2019s the point of the sub.", "Yeah that would be a lot of cocaine, especially since he saw him pull it out of the bag and \" pass it around the table\" .", "Whether he brought all of it or just a fraction is irrelevant. The point is that he knew he was knowingly exposing his recovering addict friend", "Whether he brought all of it or just a fraction is irrelevant. The point is that he knew he was knowingly exposing his recovering addict friend", "Almost every single post we get here is one sided. We need to take what we get, or we might as well just retire this sub", "I like how everyone is looking at addiction and the struggles thereof as if he was having a hissy fit because the wrong sort of water was served. He's a recovering addict who was in a situation that tempted him and could have made him relapse. At someone who knew of his past and his struggles. He got caught up in all of that. Geez", "He steered the situation right into himself by making the situation about himself and causing a scene. Control doesn't just mean intentionally trying to make things a certain way. He lost control of himself trying to exert more control over the situation\u2014he wanted his friend to care more. \n\nTo be clear, this is an incredibly valid feeling. However, it would have been healthier, more empowered, and most self-possessed to just leave. And when I say those things, I'm talking strictly to the benefit of OP. It would have been better *for* OP, their recovery, and their sense of self.", "I really don\u2019t get people who try to extrapolate every story, and create a new narrative that better suits their point.", "OP story looked legit and believable,even if I think they're the AH. It's the edit that's the problem.\n\nIt looks a lot less \" legit \"after. Feels like OP wasn't getting the reaction they wanted and magically Luke is now the one who brought the coke. It's a major point that changes the story that they somehow\"forgot to include\". Especially since OP apparently \"saw him doing it\". It's a weird omission.\n\nAnd the way they describe it sounds like what a teenager thinks taking drugs in a group looks like.", "It sucks to be an addict but that\u2019s a you problem and no one else. Time to grow up.", "Im an addict. Blowing up at someone because theyre taking drugs in the same building as you is ridiculous. Just leave. Text them to explain if you cant talk to them calmly", "I\u2019d say more like three quarters", "If addiction isn't an excuse to be an asshole then what excuse does Luke have if he's not even an addict?", "Yes, it is a problem, in particular a you problem, as in the type of attitude that you are exhibiting. Addiction is a societal problem, and it isn't about growing up. It is trying to live a life rife with temptation on a daily basis. One of the major coping mechanisms is your circle; OP could have handled it better, yes, but a friend should have taken more care and would be more concerned about that, then oh you embarrassed me. And OP, did call him to the side; I can guess that OP blew up because Luke was  oblivious to the harm he had caused and could have caused.", "Clearly the growing up is not about addiction but acting how he did at that party because he\u2019s sober. This is a one sided story completely. Luke didn\u2019t call him over and ask him to snort a line with him. Life is rife with temptations so it\u2019s up to him to be able to remove himself from situations. He wasn\u2019t offered coke or anything of the sort. \n\nIt is not anyone else\u2019s problem and we need to stop acting as if it is. We can say luke should have cared more all we want but he isn\u2019t the problem. OP is. Why does Luke need to be a better friend when OP clearly wasn\u2019t being one himself? Luke didn\u2019t cause any harm at all. And hypotheticals are pointless because they didn\u2019t happen. Op is absolutely the asshole and your comments try to absolve him of any of his actions that actually caused harm. Why can\u2019t a person enjoy their birthday without their friend yelling at them because things aren\u2019t perfect for their sobriety?", "Well, we obviously and will continuously disagree. Op could have handled it better by not yelling once he had called Luke over, but Luke messed up. I don't know about you, but my personal laws of hospitality aim to create an atmosphere of welcome and comfort for all. Let everyone feel safe, welcomed, and not pressured or put in a situation that could hurt their personal well-being.\n\nI've had family members and friends with addiction issues, as I have had as well. I'm not inviting anyone I know who struggles with addiction to any gathering wherein their drug of choice is going to be openly shared and indulged in."]}
