For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019ll call him Luke. I met Luke in college and we have been fairly close friends ever since. I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s my closest friend, but we\u2019re close enough to where he invited me to his birthday party. \n\nHe knows a decent bit about my history, but i really don\u2019t like to talk about my past that much. I won\u2019t get into the details but i do suffer from PTSD and used to cope with drugs. To put the entire story into a super oversimplified sentence: my dad is a dick and I used to have a coke problem. However, I can say that I am now completely sober and have been for a year. Luke doesn\u2019t know all the details of my past, but he does know that i used to be an addict. \n\nI hadn\u2019t had any close calls for a while until last night when i went to Luke\u2019s birthday party. I was told it would be a \u201csmall hangout\u201d but when arrived, it was a *party.* probably 30-40 people at the peak, loud music, and enough alcohol to feed a village. Luke was always the type of guy who liked parties, so this wasn\u2019t a huge shock. Everything was fine for the first part of the night, That was until i saw out of the corner of my eye, some people, including Luke, sitting around a table doing lines. The whole party was starting to gravitate in that direction, and i could tell that this was about to become the sole focus of the rest of the night. \n\nNow i want to clarify, i have no issue if those people want to partake in that. Do whatever you want, it\u2019s your funeral. What i did have a problem with, was my \u201cfriend\u201d, inviting me to his party knowing damn well that there was going to be drugs and that I was a recovering addict. I had managed to stay clean for so long, and it was literally a few feet away from me. This was my worst nightmare. \n\nI blew up at him, I pulled him to the side and screamed at how stupid he was and how shitty it was of him to do this to his supposed \u201cfriend.\u201d My screaming drew the attention of a lot of the crowd and Luke looked horribly embarrassed, but i stormed out before he could respond to me. \n\nI went home, and went to bed, but when I woke up i had a catalogue of texts from Luke saying how he didn\u2019t think it would have mattered to me because i had been sober for so long, and that regardless it was out of line for me to explode like that because it \u201cruined his birthday.\u201d He keeps saying that if i didn\u2019t like it, i \u201cshould have just left and not made my addiction everyone else\u2019s problem.\u201d \n\nto me, it felt like a huge violation of trust. I had confided in him that i had drug problems and he failed to consider me or even warn me beforehand that this would be happening at his party. I haven\u2019t responded to anything he has said yet but I am still absolutely pissed at him.  \n\nso, AITA for yelling at my friend at his birthday party?", "created_utc": 1688291420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14okdkg/aita_for_screaming_at_my_friend_during_his/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you - understandbly - had problems with what you saw, you should immediately leave.", "YTA. Sorry you struggled with your sobriety at this moment, but you need to have better coping skills. The party was about him, not you, and you should have just left if you were uncomfortable. I understand this reaction if someone whipped out some coke at your book club or something, but this was a big party and you can\u2019t control what goes on around you at someone\u2019s rager.\n\nEta: I do want to congratulate you on your sobriety because I know that\u2019s hard. From now on I would suggest you ask people if there will be drugs at a party prior to attending them, rather than assume things due to your personal history. However, even if there wasn\u2019t a spoken plan for someone to bring it yet a guest did, that\u2019s an added bonus for lots of people and still acceptable if that\u2019s what they want to do. It\u2019s a you problem, not a them problem, and there will be some parties you have to just remove yourself from because of this.", "YTA, it actually sounds like you do in fact have an issue with other people doing it. Parties can involve drugs. You could easily have just pulled him aside and politely told him that you were leaving early as the drugs were still an issue and you didn't want to be tempted. He's almost certainly have been cool with it and you could move on. You don't even know if the drugs were pre-planned or if someone brought them and it just became a thing in the moment. You can't go around screaming at people just because they're doing something you can't/struggle with, it's on you to remove yourself from the situation. You were a dick about it. Apologise and move on and think about how you may be able to manage a similar situation better in future. Your friend is right, you cannot make your addiction everyone else's problem like that. It's nobody's responsibility to manage but yours.", "ESH\n\nYour friend should have at least warned you beforehand there will be drugs. \n\nYou should have just left when you started feeling overwhelmed. \n\nWith that said, I can understand that you didn't develop enough coping skills yet and was acting out of emotional reaction, but you have to apologize for that.\n\nAnyway, congrats on being sober! It's goddamn hard and you should be proud of yourself", "ESH. Like for not thinking about you, you for thinking only about yourself. You should have just leave. As you said yourself you were not shocked that there were drugs at the party", "YTA\n\nWe all have a past, problems and struggles. They are for us to deal with. You made his party about you. You should have left.", "I don't get all the YTAs here as you simply don't knowingly invite someone struggling with addiction to a party after they get sober where they are tempted to start using again. If you want to do drugs don't invite the recovering addict or if you want to invite the recovering addict don't do drugs \n\nNTA", "NTA. If he was a good friend he wouldn't have invited you or at least gave you the heads up. Friends are supposed to be there and encourage you. He just proved he doesn't care about your sobriety. You had every right for yelling at him for inviting you to a place he knew there was going to be drugs. The fact that he still doesn't get what's wrong with what he did says a lot about the type of person he is.", "Absolutely NTA. A birthday is not a get out of jail free card to be shitty, and if he was a good friend he would have helped you avoid the stuff. An addition should indeed be your friend\u2019s problem, especially if the only thing required of him is to avoid you being so close to a potential relapse. Boo-ooh, he was yelled at for doing coke. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be traumatized for all eternity.", "NTA brother. Three years clean this past July (alcohol), I know the daily struggles I still have. And I have or had too many friends like Luke who are oh just go on the other side of the party; or my old favorite one drink won't hurt. Have cousins who are and were on coke, and it is a daily struggle with them. Jettison him; I did most of my old friends due to the same crass inconsiderate behavior. \n\nTo those who are saying yta, you obviously have never really dealt with addiction or with someone close to you being addicted. All it takes is one slip, and you are in worse than before, down a hole that never lets up. It is an hourly battle that you have to fight. You have to choose your spaces and subject matter with care. Yeah, even movies and all that. Because that one drink or one line is all it takes. I battled with alcoholism for years. Up and down, my life is finally flowing along the lines I needed it to. The risky behavior and nihilism of an addicts life is not a joke. It ruins your life and the lives around you. \n\nKeep strong brother.", "INFO: Who brought the drugs, Luke or one of his other friends?", "ESH. If he is a close friend, then he should have let you know in advance what kind of party it was going to be. It would have been kind.\n\nThat being said, it is his home and his choice about how he celebrates. If you are uncomfortable in a situation, then you leave it. You don't try and blame everyone else for your discomfort. Screaming at him at his own birthday party is a dick move. You could have just left and then spoken to him the day after about what you need in the future.", "ESH.\nThey are because anybody who is using drugs is the AH to himself, and you are  because you just had to leave, it's not your business what your friend taking in on his party.", "ESH. \n\nAs harsh as this sounds, just because you have a drug problem, doesn't mean everyone else needs to pander to your needs. You're absolutely right in saying your \"friend\" should have probably given you a heads up, but you can't rely on other people to be so considerate. You also could have just removed yourself from the situation as soon as you saw what was going on.", "NTA. I do agree with the comments on here saying that it's your responsibility to manage your addiction, but if he was actually a good friend he wouldn't have put you in this situation in the first place. If he was more of an acquaintance, I would say you overreacted, but if he is really a close friend he sould have told you there would be drugs at the party.  He might have even lied about the nature of the party to get you to relapse.", "ESH. He absolutely should have warned you that drugs would be present. Especially your ex poison of choice. However, you should not have caused a big scene. \n\nYou should have left, and spoken to him at a later time telling him how you felt. \n\nHe probably naively believed that once you are \u201crecovered\u201d that that was that. No more issue. Ignorant and naive. But not everyone understands the complexities of addiction and that you will always be in recovery. \n\nHe fucked up first for sure. But you made it worse.", "YTA\n\nit is not anybody else\u2019s job to keep you sober. It is your job. It is not anybody else responsibility to keep you away from situations that make sobriety difficult. It is your job.", "Luke had a birthday party, it was about him.\n\nGreat that you have been sober, it is hard work.\n\nI know alcoholics - but there is never a blow up when there is a party and there is alcohol (which, as it is legal is openly available and accepted by society, is not considered an issue).\n\nAt the end of the day, you will encounter drugs, alcohol etc wherever you go. Your issue will be there forever - you cannot \"scream\" at people whenever you encounter it. You will not get warning for future exposures, so you need to start dealing with it and managing it.\n\nIf \"Luke\" had to cater for everyone's issues and PTSD at his party, then I imagine it wouldn't be fun for anyone.\n\nGood luck, I hope you are OK.\n\nEDIT: Typo", "Ugh YTA obviously, congratulations on being sober , but you\u2019re a grown man and you need to learn how to remove yourself from triggering situations without making your problem everyone else\u2019s too. It was HIS day  ..not your anniversary party of being sober.. you can\u2019t control what other adults do in life & that\u2019s embarrassing behavior. You could have communicated like an adult with something like ..hey dude I\u2019m gonna go this stuff isn\u2019t good for me to be around ,happy birthday\u201d like you gotta grow up. You don\u2019t scream at anyone & especially your friend at his birthday celebration!", "NTA because Luke brought the drugs. Could you have walked away? Yes.", "Honestly, this is a tricky one. Everyone's addiction looks different and not everyone in your position would require a heads up. I don't think your friend is at fault necessarily for not recognising that this was still a trigger given your progress. \n\nI'm gonna go with YTA. You could have just excused yourself without causing a scene.", "YTA. You should have just left, if Luke wanted to do drugs at his party, that's his choice, no one was forcing you to participate. You made a huge scene because of YOUR problems, you owe him an apology.", "you should have left and talked to him later about it. next time he wants to bring drugs to tell you, so you won't attend future parties.", "YTA you could have just left if you can\u2019t handle being around it. I am a recovering alcoholic and just recently I was food tasting for my sons wedding and they were pairing foods with champagnes and wines the staff kept trying to offer me them and I politely declined. Not acted like an ass.", "NTA especially because he brought the drugs. I'd reconsider your friendship with him if I were you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
