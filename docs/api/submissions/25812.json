D\u2019s mom and I were never officially together so we have always been co-parenting and it has caused us to remain good friends. I also have a wife, we've been together for 6 years married for 2, and we have twin sons who are 8 months old. Until now my wife and I have never had any issues let alone about my daughter from a previous relationship.   \n\n\nD was diagnosed with cancer (Leukemia) about 3  weeks ago. She is doing inpatient chemo for a month. She is about a week 1/2 in and it's been rough on my strong girl. I visit her for at least a few hours a day sometimes I stay the night at the hospital with D it just depends. D\u2019s hair started falling out in chunks recently so it needed to be shaved. When I came to visit D today  I also brought a razor. D was sad about her hair\u2026 seeing it fall out as well as having to shave it. I told her she could shave my hair first. So I let her shave my head and even though getting her head shaved was difficult I got her to smile when I said we could get matching hats. \n\nEven though my head getting shaved was very last minute and unexpected I figured my wife would understand\u2026 she didn't and yelled at me for not telling her I was going to shave her head and that I'm an AH for not telling her and embarrassing her with a bald husband. My wife has been always into keeping an image but I figured she would understand this. But she is still mad and ends up going to her parents\u2026 I feel like I should have told her now instead of just coming home AITA?", "created_utc": 1693334100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164qe5k/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_i_shaved_my_hair/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't do anything wrong. How can you stay with someone so self-centered and cruel? Like really man, what is wrong with her?\n\nNTA I think your wife is maybe not a good person", "NTA, your wife sucks and Im sorry she can't just see you for the great father you are.", "NTA at all. Your wife sounds quite young & immature. Even if you did it because you just wanted to shave your head, her reaction is over the top & unnecessary. Under the circumstances, it\u2019s even worse. \n\nI hope D makes a full recovery. Cancer is so tough. My heart goes out to you & her mother.", "NTA: that reaction tells me there is something much greater going on here.", "NTA but your wife is for not being understanding or supportive of you in a rough time.  It speaks volumes that she is more concerned about her embarrassment than what your daughter is going through.", "NTA\n\nHold on...  that's your hair. Your wife doesn't get to order you to have a specific kind of hairstyle, and this wasn't even about *style*. It was for the best of reasons.", "When I met my husband, he was 23 and sporting a totally bald look. My goodness it, it was incredibly sexy. He grew his hair out when we our youngest son was 3, since he had long hair too. Swoon! Bald head, head of hair, doesn\u2019t matter! The man is still sexy!", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. Supporting your daughter and shaving your head to make her feel a little less awkward was a lovely thing to do.\n\nIf your wife really thinks that all hair decisions need to be discussed, then try giving her the same exact treatment the next time she gets her hair done and see how she reacts.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry your wife is an insufferable jackass who\u2019d rather your 11 year old daughter feel even more disconnected from everyone than have a husband with a shaved head.", "Holy shit, NTA. Your wife is making your daughter\u2019s scary ordeal about her and how others perceive her. That\u2019s not a non-assholey person. And she has you believing her bull shit. Good luck dude.", "What a lovely gesture, top dad", "INFO: will your wife also accuse you of \"embarrassing her\" with your bald child? What an exceptionally fucked up response. NTA.", "NTA- I would bet that your wife would completely agree with your shaving your head if it was for one of your sons.\n\nRationally, it is hard to fathom how she could be upset about you doing it for your daughter, but your mentioning she is so image conscious makes me suspect she flipped because your hair is something she cannot hide and in her explanation she has to tell people you have a child with someone other than her, and it is having to do that which is pissing her off.", "Wow!  NTA!  I am so sorry for your daughter and you that she's going through this!  Your wife should be thrilled that you are such a great dad!  Her priority of appearances over your daughter's health and your support of her is pretty gross.  I don't know how you navigate a person that shallow and seemingly entitled.  Best to your daughter beating her leukemia!", "Absolutely NTA\n\nGiven that you did this on the spur of the moment, it would be understandable if your wife was SURPRISED when you walked in the door bald as an egg, or even shocked. It would even have been okay if she'd said, \"You know, I wish you would have given me a head's up.\"  You didn't need her permission, obviously, and as someone else noted, it was a beautiful gesture to make your daughter feel less awkward and isolated as the chemo changes her body outwardly. I know a little something about that, as someone whose body has changed drastically and in unpleasant ways from 30 years of very strong medications for serious chronic illness, and my heart goes out to your little girl. Being a kid and very sick is so hard. I remember it way too well.\n\nBut yeah, your wife wouldn't have been an AH if she had expressed shock initially, or needed a bit of time to get used to the drastic change. \n\nWhere she becomes a massive, hateful AH is that *she knows exactly why you did this, and she doesn't care, and is still wholly and entirely focused on the aesthetics of it*. Which is horrifying.\n\nShe's an AH because she got so angry about you changing something that yes, was drastic, but also temporary, that she actually had a rageful tantrum and went to stay at her parents' house. That's such a huge overreaction - not to mention a shocking misplacement of priorities - that I really have to wonder about her morals and character. \n\nWhat you did was kind, loving, and in service of your child . . . her stepdaughter. And all she cares about is that you look funny, temporarily. You are NTA, and the only one who should be embarrassed here is your wife, for her selfish behaviour.", "NTA. At first I read it you did it for D\u2019s mom your ex. I\u2019m like hold on wait a minute. But you did it for your young daughter. I think maybe you should have given her a heads up about. But that can\u2019t happen now because that was the past. I think it\u2019s time the wife chill out. You are a loving dad to your little girl who needs you \ud83e\ude77", "NTA - seven hells you have your head to support your kid who is going through a hell of a thing. You didn't glue a fluorescent wig to your head and stick peacock feathers to your backside before completing a lurid tap dance up and down the street.\n\nWhat on earth is your wife getting so up in arms about? Plenty of people save their heads for a variety of reasons. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. I'd think of anything she should be proud of you for trying to be a good parent.\n\nAddition, best of luck to \"D\" with her treatment", "NTA. Your wife is the asshole for putting superficial nonsense above the need to support your daughter.\n\nHow THE FUCK is being bald to support a child with cancer supposed to be embarrassing?", "NTA Your body, your choice. I don\u2019t understand ppl who think they own their spouse\u2019s physical appearance.", "NTA.  It's your hair.  Your head...your life, your daughter.  \n\n\nYour wife is \"into image?\"  Wow.  What would she do if you legit went bald?  Divorce you due to \"image?\"  OUCH dude.  She's not...yeah...that's not good.", "NTA. She was way out of line.", "NTA on the hair issue.  Your wife's reaction is concerning.\n\nBut your daughter's illness surely must be a topic of discussion with your wife. So how is it possible that you never even casually mentioned/texted/whatever your wife about the idea of shaving your hair in solidarity?  It wasn't like it was spur of the moment at the hospital, you said you brought the razor there for the visit.", "NTA - what would be wrong with a bald husband? She\u2019s acted WAY over the top. I\u2019m so sorry about your daughter and hope she has a quick recovery. Good for you for being a good dad.", "Dear Lord NTA. It is your body and your choice. I\u2019m astounded your wife doesn\u2019t understand", "NTA.\n\nShe wouldn't have this reaction if your twins had cancer and did this to support them.  Wife needs to grow up.", "NTA. So much NTA. Look, I get that not everybody has a head shape that looks good bald. But it's to support a young child going through hell. It will grow back, on both of you. Your wife is a complete AH.\n\nBest wishes for D's recovery.", "NTA. Very nice last moment decision. Even if only a tiny bit, you definitely made D feel better about the shaving. Especially since she was the one who got to shave you. Nice touch\n\nBut, your girl is 11, how can your wife be so self centered she yells at you? And I doubt you are/look bald. With a razor in two days you will clearly look that you have hair but shaved it and in a short time have hair. Very selfish of your wife and unreasonable. \n\nJust a side question, how is she treating D and how is she reacting to you sleeping over and being with her so much? (Also very nice and surely very helpful for D)\n\nPerhaps D would appreciate all the people wishing her well? Could you set up some safe address (not your home) for some cards? I\u2019ve seen some posts when people asked for a sick/old person to get cards and they got so manny from all over the world! Would that make D happy, all the people writing nice things, sending nice postcards?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
