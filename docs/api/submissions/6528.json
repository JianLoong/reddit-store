{"id": 6528, "submission_id": "103gx2l", "title": "AITA for telling my sister not to use a certain name for her baby?", "selftext": "My (M45) youngest sister (38) announced at Christmas she\u2019s expecting her first baby.\u00a0\n\nPreviously she said it\u2019s unfair to bring children into this world, they are a drain on resources, etc. Even when my wife or other sisters were pregnant, she said this. So we were\u00a0surprised when she announced her pregnancy, but she seemed happy, so we were too.\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s already 6 months along, with a boy, who she wants to call him \u201cGreg\u201d (not the actual name) after our brother, who died when he was 28.\u00a0\n\nThis shocked me, because my sister and Greg were not particularly close. They got on, but spent the least time together out of all of us. When she was born, Greg was 7. We went to boarding school at 8. Obviously we saw her at breaks, but didn\u2019t really grow up together, in the way we did with each other and our other sisters.\u00a0\n\nGreg and I were identical twins and exceptionally close. His name is a trigger. I have PTSD from discovering his body. I can think about my brother and his life with not *too* many intrusive thoughts, but when hearing his name I get flashbacks. My sister knows this. I get therapy, but the issue remains.\u00a0\n\nAlso, my sister would always say she feels naming babies after people is old fashioned. Yet now she wants to do this herself, the exact thing she said \u201cstrips babies of their individuality\u201d.\u00a0\n\nI was really upset by the entire interaction and my knee-jerk reaction to her baby name choice was to blurt out \u201cno, you can\u2019t call him that\u201d. Obviously my sister didn\u2019t react well to this, saying that I don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d my brother\u2019s name and I\u2019m not the only one who misses him. She is right, I know that. But she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have panic attacks and flashbacks when hearing his name. She doesn\u2019t know the horrific scene I walked in on. And she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose a twin.\n\n\u00a0I acknowledge she has as much a right to mourn our brother as I do, but he and I shared a flat, we were always together at home, at school, in the womb. We were best friends. It\u2019s hard enough seeing his face when I look in the mirror, without hearing his name too. I don\u2019t feel \u201cpossessive\u201d of him, as my sister claims, but he and I *were* always closest. That\u2019s a fact. That doesn\u2019t negate his bond with our sisters, but we were the most important people in each other\u2019s lives. Does this change because he\u2019s dead?\u00a0\n\nShe said at least *someone* would be honouring him (a reference to me and our sisters not naming our kids Greg). This really upset me. Life is a constant struggle since he died. Very often I want to join him. Her suggestion that i don\u2019t care really hurt. I admit it was wrong to reply she is doing this whole thing for attention, but she just made all these announcements, on Christmas Day no less, and caught me off guard. She hung up and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. I\u2019ve tried to reach out several times.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m worried I\u2019ve ruined our relationship and/or ruined the name for her.

I\u2019m so sorry, OP - saying the obvious, NTA, seems insignificant. All I can suggest is you either write to her what you\u2019ve said so well here, or if you think it would be better, ask for a talk and tell her why this would be so painful for you - even tho I agree that there\u2019s something very off in her even thinking this might be a good idea. In either case, I would suggest not speaking at all about her relationship with you late brother. Only tell her about your experience, losing your twin, and having to find him in death; surely she would want a name for her baby that doesn\u2019t carry so much heartbreak. She\u2019s bringing a life into the world, that baby needs the chance to make a wonderful new story all his own, without any tragic weight attached to his name. Again, I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through, and are going through still.", "NTA. But this is above Reddit's pay grade.\n\nI mean, it's true nobody owns a name; but your situation is totally understandable and your sister should be more sympathetic in this regard.\n\nIMVHO, it might be good that you seek therapy to see how you can better cope with your loss. It's clear this has been affecting your life, and I think your brother always wanted you to live your life to the fullest (this doesn't mean you have to forget about him).\n\nI'm so sorry for the things you're going thru and wish you the best!", "NTA\n\nAnd my condolences. Losing a sibling is losing a piece of yourself. Losing a twin? Can't even imagine. A half of you that made you whole is gone.\n\nI get your reaction. It was spontanous.\n\nMaybe someone else of your family, your wife maybe, can reach out and explain the PTSD? Can explain your nightmares? Can explain why you will never forget, never not mourn, and need therapy?\n\nI hope she'll come to her senses.\n\nIf I were her, I would have asked you privately what you think about naming him. Heck, we name our son after a King, a German Emperor, and a Caesar, and we still checked in with every friend of the same name if they would mind, including all the family members, before announcing the name.\n\nIn case of a death, you should check in with the closest relatives. She didn't.\n\nPregnancy hormones are no excuse for being insensitive. I hope she'll come around.\n\nYou won't have another chance than cutting contact else I'd fear. With everyone in the family who doesn't get it.", "You\u2019re not the asshole but your sister absolutely is. My sister died 7 years ago. I miss her but I know for a fact her death was much harder on her identical twin. I will never pretend it wasn\u2019t or that she should \u201cbe over it\u201d at any point during our life. They were always the closest to each other since birth. She still cries on their birthday every year. I make it a point to call her every year on their birthday and the day that our sister died. At the funeral, my sister had a woman hug her for a long time while she pretended that she was hugging her twin one last time. She also had a little girl cry because she saw her and thought she was seeing the ghost of her twin. I will never deny that it was wholly more traumatic for her than it was for anyone else and that\u2019s WITHOUT having found her body herself like you have experienced. I am pregnant now and I did consider naming the baby after our sister. Ultimately I am not, but if I had planned to go through with it and found out that my sister would not like that then that would be it. I wouldn\u2019t do it. And if I had hypothetically decided to do it anyway then I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to expect my sister to have anything to do with the baby. \nYour sister is being selfish and inconsiderate of your very real feelings and trauma. I think it shows how much she actually cares about her siblings to begin with. I\u2019m sorry, I wish you the best OP.", "NTA for your feelings. But your delivery left a lot to be desired. Maybe you could write her a letter about how you feel. Leave all the personal judgements out, though. She may not fully understand the depth of your trauma. I hope not. Otherwise, she's being a selfish jerk. But let's hope for the latter.", "NTA.  Your sister sounds so full of herself I don't even know where to begin.", "NAH\n\nI do think she was a bit rude in her responses, but it\u2019s kind of understandable after your bit of an outburst.\n\nAt the end of the day, everything you pointed out is true.  She\u2019s allowed to pick whatever name she wants, and she can grieve and honor her brother however she wants.\n\nBut the same applies to you.  *Your* grief is also valid.  It\u2019s not like you\u2019re not doing the work to make peace with your trauma, but it was *fucking traumatic*.  That shit sticks with you, and it can take a long time to get to a place where you have all the coping skills you need.  \n\nSo, yeah, she can name her kid to honor her late brother if she wants to.  But if she wants you to have any sort of presence in your nephew\u2019s life (and vice versa), then she needs to be considerate of how that name will affect both you and her son going forward.", "NTA\n\nI will add that pregnancy is a highly vulnerable time. You say you are not as close to your sister because she is much younger, she might be wanting to call attention to herself in a effort to recreate family proximity. \n\nConsider getting together with your other siblings and having people explain to her how your PTSD affects you. It\u2019s important for her to know that you will love her and her baby and of course you will be there to with love for your nibbling. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss and hope that your family can all navigate this and welcome the new member with love.", "NTA\n\nI think it's a pain she clearly can't comprehend from her own experience, which is unfortunate. As another commenter suggested having someone else reach out to help explain your reaction might be helpful. \n\nA compromise could be giving her son the middle name Greg instead of first name. For me that is something very common in these situations. I also think she isn't considering how it will feel for her saying his name a million times a day to someone who isn't her brother. Personally that would kill me inside. \n\nI hope you can figure something out. I do think your sister is being quite selfish though and not considering anyone else's feelings. It also feels like she wanted the attention as well.", "NTA.  I sort of get her reasoning, to her Greg was the cool big brother that would drop in for a few months, then be gone again, but to you, he was the other half of your soul.\n\nPlease please please find someone to talk to about this.  You need that more than you need her right now.  And a big hug as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From what you've said, I think your sister might have misunderstood some things. If she truly just wants to feel like your brother is being remembered and honored, I think it's time to have a conversation and be more open about your feelings. Apologize for your reaction - as you said it was just a knee-jerk thing. Giving her the benefit of doubt, your sister may not know just how difficult and painful it is for you to hear that name. There's unfortunately nothing you can do if she decides to go ahead anyway, but talking to all your family members about the impact could get her to hopefully rethink her name choice.", "NTA and sorry to say your sister is a huge one", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose a sibling, let alone find your twin, but I can understand from your explanation of the situation how this impacts you.

It feels like I\u2019m carrying around a weight. My mom made her friend\u2019s name my middle name because she felt so much guilt about her friends death, that she wasn\u2019t able to prevent it.

I would have called your sister NTA too, but her reaction and acting as though you don't care is just hurtful. You both need to understand that you are both grieving, and doing it in different ways, and that neither way is inherently wrong. Yes, you may have been closer to him, but that doesn't mean she's not allowed to grieve too. Once you're at a place where you can talk to each other without hostility, i'd suggest telling her how her child will feel knowing his aunt will never be able to see him or say his name. I'd also bring up the risk of her projecting your brother's image onto her son. I've heard tales of grieving parents naming their kid after deceased loved ones, and then unintentionally putting expectations on the kid to act just like those loved ones. That kinda thing can really fuck up a kid.", "NAH, yet.\n\nYou have very good reasoning to not want her to name her child after your deceased brother; now, blurting it out that way immediately was not a tactful way to handle it, but it doesn't make you an AH, especially because this gets into a very traumatic area of your life. Her comment about someone honoring him was worse, but family pain around grief in an environment where people are reacting quickly in an argument is understandable to me. I get that she would be instinctively defensive as she was clearly excited about this, and just because you don't think she was that close to him, he still may mean a lot to her. \n\nI think if you explain your thoughts to her like you have to us, calmly and while acknowledging her grief, my hope would be she would change her mind (or maybe compromise, would a middle name straddle the line between her being able to honor him while not having to trigger you nearly as often)? Also, I hope she'd apologize for her comment. However, if she still is defensive and unwilling to acknowledge your pain/reasoning, I'd change to NTA (meaning she'd be the AH)", "NAH\n\nShe may not know what's it's like to lose a twin, but yall both know what's it's like to lose a brother.\n\nPeople grieve and honor ppl in different ways.

If it was a middle name then she would still be honouring our brother, but without it having to be used all the time. I would be happy with that, but first name is just too much.

I shouldn\u2019t have said she was doing it for attention though, because I don\u2019t know her intentions and it\u2019s not fair of me to make that accusation. She does love \u201cGreg\u201d, so I don\u2019t think even she would use his death for attention. Hopefully. The baby\u2019s birth will be milked for all it is worth, mind you!", "Well she knows the basics, obviously, like he took his life voluntarily and he died by blood loss. She doesn\u2019t know about his blood spattered up the walls and on the ceiling and the light shade, or the landlord making me get new carpet and underlay, because his blood had soaked through that one. She doesn\u2019t know about him looking so grey and hollow or the way his eyes stayed open and he looked so haunted, but obviously lifeless. Depressed even when he had supposedly escaped it all. Or the way his mouth gaped open and he looked so troubled and contorted and horrible. She doesn\u2019t know he had wet himself and he was still holding the knife because his death throes must have caused him to change his grip and his hand had contracted around the blade, embedding it in his palm. She doesn\u2019t know how much blood an adult man contains and what it looks like when it\u2019s decorating your walls and ceiling. I would tell her if she really wanted to know all of the horrible details, but I don\u2019t see any positive that would come from her knowing all that. I am not trying to keep anything from her, so much as spare her the trauma (although I don\u2019t have enough words to adequately describe his face). \n\nI don\u2019t know how to describe what it is like to lose a twin. I would tell her if I could. It\u2019s your best friend, brother, constant companion, other half. I suppose it\u2019s like if someone removes your soul, shatters it into pieces and gives you just a tiny, mangled fragment back. And really you are just a shell, trying to pretend you\u2019re a person. And every single thing in your life has so many memories of them. And the new things are devoid of meaning because they\u2019re not there to share it. But that all sounds stupid and dramatic and ungrateful, because I am so lucky to have my wife and children, I know I am. I can\u2019t say any of that to my sister, because I don\u2019t want her to think I don\u2019t value my family. \n\nI have bottled up a lot, you\u2019re right, because it\u2019s too hard to say. But she knows I have PTSD (from this and also childhood trauma), and she knows I get panic attacks, nightmares and flashbacks. I\u2019ve told her and also she has witnessed this, and also my five year old likes to tell people \u201cdaddy shouts in his sleep\u201d, ha!", "Stupid asshole", "What makes me say NTA is the blatant hypocrisy from the sister. She looked down on having kids and reinforced it when family members got pregnant. Called naming babies after others old fashioned but then does it and shames Op for not naming one of his children after the brother.", "He is the one that found the body. No amount of therapy will fix that. He\u2019s allowed to feel how he feels.", "Dearest OP, i just read through a number of your previous posts, bc I didn\u2019t understand when another comment mentioned how awful things had been with your parents. Sorry to comment again, but I\u2019m astounded that you have survived, not only survived but have concern for your sister - and you\u2019re succeeding in a loving marriage, devoted to your kids. You\u2019re absolutely extraordinary, more than that. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that perhaps one day you\u2019ll write it all out, a few of those posts are truly unforgettable. In any case, I want to say - hold on tight, you\u2019re needed here; and after all the darkness you\u2019ve already had to live through, you deserve nothing but light and love for the rest of your days.", "Hello. Thank you for responding to my note. I didn\u2019t intend to minimize your sister\u2019s sadness, only that the issue of the name is obviously different for you, and she seems not to be getting that. I hope this gets sorted, and that in the long run, you can enjoy this new addition to the family, OP. All the best to you.", "Totally understandable.\n\nI hope you can sort things out with your sister. Perhaps your wife can help by giving her a better idea where your coming from; everybody deal with loss in different ways and your sister may need to get a better picture.", "You need to tell your sister all of this. Whether she wants to hear it or not. This is the only way for her to even begin to have some sort of understanding of what you are dealing with. You are NTA. She is and she needs to know why she is.", "Oh no, sorry, I meant that I had minimised her sadness, not you. I was just trying to say that I like your idea of just having a conversation with her about what he and I meant to each other, and maybe leaving her relationship with him out of it, because I would then run the risk of maybe being a bit like \u201cyou barely knew him\u201d. Which would be awful of me (and I feel like a horrible person for even thinking that way). I would be so unkind to make her feel like her feelings are less valid than mine. And I have no idea how anyone else feels anyway, maybe she is just as devastated as I am. \n\nMy wife thinks that my sister is well aware of the fact she barely knew him, and that\u2019s why she is doing this, to feel closer to him. I think that is possible. If she would stop ignoring me then I could try to talk to her about it properly. I don\u2019t know what to do, I guess just give her time and hope she will speak to me soon.", "Could always send her a quick apology email along with a link to this post. \n\n\"Sister, I'm sorry for the way I responded to your announcement on Christmas. Our brother's name is still very triggering to me. When you get the time please read this post I made on reddit and my comments too. I need you to know my trauma.\""]}
