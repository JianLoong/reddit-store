I\u2019m currently on a vacation in Hawaii with friends. However I feel like I ruined it. \n\nMost of my friends on this trip I\u2019ve grown up, except one, for this story I\u2019ll be just calling her Katie (23F). Katie has been hanging out with my friend group while I was away for college. I\u2019ve only talked with her via discord groups before this and it\u2019s our first time hanging out. \n\nI was honestly really hesitant on having joining this trip just because I don\u2019t know her too well. But my friend group had reassured me that she was a cool person and it will be fun, so I accepted the invitation to go on this trip. Everything was great till she snapped at me. \n\nSince we are in Hawaii I wanted to get some souvenirs for my family and asked if we could go certain place and get opinions on items through out the trip. While we were getting ready this morning, Katie suddenly got really mad with me. I only asked if we could go to a certain shop on island so I could get something for my sister. She started crying and said I was gloating about my family and ranting that I was being inconsiderate towards her.  \n\nShe stormed out of our hotel room. Leaving me so confused and no clue what she was mad about. My other friends later told me that she doesn\u2019t really have a good history/relationship with her family so she\u2019s really sensitive about the topic of family.  \n\nWhen Katie came back to the room she was still mad. I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I had no clue about her situation. I\u2019ll be careful in the future.\u201d But it was useless. Katie was still mad and said I should\u2019ve know cause she has talked about her hatred/family life on discord all the time. I don\u2019t really check discord too often and group chats can be pretty chaotic. All I could do was say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I had no clue.\u201d I told her this and she just grabbed her stuff and refused to speak with me for the remainder of this trip. \n\nOur friends were able to work the rooming situation and separated us. Now the trip feels awful and I feel like I\u2019m to blame. However at the same time I don\u2019t feel like I didn\u2019t anything bad. The only times I talked about my family was what type of gifts so and so. I feel like just because she has a bad relationship with her family doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t talk about mine causally. I wasn\u2019t even gloating. \n\nHalf of my friends say I\u2019m a asshole and should be nicer to her. The other half say it\u2019s okay and she has things to work on.

You weren't even tone deaf - when you were told about her family issues you apologized and offered to be careful in the future.\n\nKatie, however, blasted you into orbit and kept acting out. Accusing you of \"gloating\", ranting and refusing to speak to you, because you said you wanted to buy a present for your sister?  Her family situation, however complicated it may be, is not an excuse for A H behavior.\n\nAnd your friends who called you an A hole? They're not your friends, they chose to be enablers of bad behavior. Katie deserves support and empathy, not pampering and blind acceptance of whatever she comes up with.", "Nta. You didn't know and you had already apologized. No one gave you a warning about her sensitivity to the topic. Girl needs some therapy if she can't handle the mention of family which is a common topic.", "If that's all there is to it, NTA.\n\nKatie sounds poorly calibrated. \n\nTry to enjoy the rest of the vacation. Maybe ask another friend to deal with her.", "NTA.  \n\nIt sounds like she has a lot to work through, however she is an adult and you can\u2019t hold yourself responsible for her emotional regulation.\n\nIt sounds like as soon as she mentioned her feelings around the topic of family you apologized.  Realistically she could have pulled you aside prior to the blow up and asked if you could mention family less around her as that\u2019s a trigger for her.  Her refusing to speak to you and acting out is AH behavior.", "NTA. She has an issue you did not know about. You apologized and offered to be careful. And in my opinion you didn't even need to offer that - does she expect people to pretend they do not have families? Family is a perfectly normal and very common topic of conversation. I feel for her, but she should be working on her issues with a therapist instead of forcing the world around her to keep silent about something perfectly normal - she is acting very entitled imo.", "NTA. I could see that if you were gloating by the means of what your family has done for you, or vice versa, in terms of gifts, holidays, vacations, etc every 5 minutes, but that's clearly not the case here.\n\nWhile it's sad that she hasn't had the best relationship with her family, that doesn't give her the right to get mad at you for having a great relationship with your family. Jealousy is an ugly emotion.", "NTA. People have families; she\u2019s going to have to hear about it. It might be hard for her, but those are the facts, and if she can\u2019t handle something as common as other people having a family, then she should get therapy.", "NTA\n\nSo long as you legitimately didn\u2019t know her problems, you seemed to only say perfectly normal things. Her reaction is her fault. \n\nRealistically, almost everyone has family. Almost everyone talks about them. If she gets triggered by something so incredibly common, that\u2019s her issue to deal with and she shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on others. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to walk on eggshells around people, especially about common, non-offensive topics that a vast majority of people wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at. \n\nHowever, now that you know it\u2019ll cause issues, maybe try to not bring up family around her moving forward. If only to avoid the drama", "NTA Katie must go through life being constantly triggered bc lots of people have good family lives and mention family members casually. Or maybe Katie is intentionally having a melt down for attention. \nPlease try to enjoy this trip and ignore the drama. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  Her jealousy of your relationship with your family is strictly her issue as long as you don't purposefully bring it up.", "NTA. I agree with the friends who say she has things to work on.", "NTA by a mile.", "NTA. If people having families are triggering, she has a tough life ahead of her.", "NTA\n\nKatie seems to be the type of person who thinks the world stopped running around the sun because she had a bad run in life, i.e. everyone else should feel as miserable as her when it comes to her personal issues. Spoiler: it isn't.\n\nYou don't have to be sorry for having the life you have. Can you be considerate? Yes. And you were, by apologising. And still, it isn't enough for her... Well, that's on her, not you.", "NTA-this is 100% a her issue.", "NTA You didn't know.

(Also, if the were other people in the group who know her better they really ought to have warned you he was abnormally sensitive on the subject, and if they didn't know, then it's even more unreasonable to expect you to have known. Plus, even if you had known that she had had bad experiences with her family, that wouldn't, normally, translate into 'never mention family members around her' - that's an unreasonable and unrealistic expectation on her part even if you had known in advance) ) \n\nAlso, while she clearly has issues, expecting others not to mention their families is not a reasonable expectation - it's reasonable to ask the group to avoid lots of in depth chat or comparisons but you shouldn't be expected to never mention your family because she has had bad experiences.", "NTA You did nothing wrong.

Doesn't mean I expect everyone else to avoid ever mentioning their dad.", "NTA its sad she has no family, but that doesnt mean everyone else have to hide their good relationships with their family, you werent gloating or rubbing anything in her face\n\nThis woman needs a therapist asap\n\nI understand how hard it is to have no family, i got none myself cuz they are abusive trash or support the abuser, but she didnt act reasonably at all\n\nOP you did NOTHING wrong, dont apologise again she doesnt deserve it", "I lost my mom thirteen years ago.

Be careful round the friends who think you are an asshole they are weird.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong and you responded a lot more sensitively than a lot of people would when she got upset. You honestly didn\u2019t know about her family issues. And even if you had, I don\u2019t think it was unreasonable to not realize that even casually mentioning family was off limits. How does she get through day to day life without being exposed to mentions of family? It\u2019s pretty common to talk about family in normal conversations (e.g. \u201cHave you seen [TV show, movie, etc.]?\u201d \u201cNo, but my brother loves it.\u201d). I get asking friends to be sensitive, but she can\u2019t ban people from mentioning their families entirely. I can\u2019t tell if Katie is truly that distraught by any mention of family that she really does become unglued or if she is just being a drama queen. If it\u2019s the former, she needs help. If it\u2019s the latter, someone needs to call her out. It\u2019s also concerning that she won\u2019t accept your apology. I get that when someone has a lot of trauma, it can be hard to overcome even accidental triggers. But that isn\u2019t on you, and if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with Katie, again, she needs serious help.\n\nI am sorry this put a damper on your vacation. I hope you are still able to have a good time. And definitely still buy gifts for your family. You are super sweet to do so!\n\nEdit:Typo", "I'm going to remember \"poorly calibrated\" for future reference. Perfect!"]}
