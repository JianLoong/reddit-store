OMG, why do people like you have kids is beyond me. Why have a second child when you cannot afford it ?", "Yta. Boundaries are fine within reason. Everyone is entitled to set reasonable boundaries. But there are reasonable ones and silly ones. \n\nA musical instrument? Reasonable to keep personal. A video game system? Eh. If they live in the same house there's little reason they can't share. As younger kids me and my brother had \"our\" systems. A Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, a PlayStation.\n\nBut we got to a point where we started buying our own. I got an N64, a Dreamcast, a GameCube, a PS2. My brother was younger so started getting these later but got an Xbox eventually.\n\nAll of these were shared. Because why not? It hurts nothing. We had a limited time to play anyway each day (you know... so we didn't spend our whole day staring at screens) so there was plenty of time for us both to get our time in even if we both wanted to play the same system. There was still a factor of each being ours. Like, I'd sometimes take my Dreamcast or GameCube in my room to play. But I wouldn't do that with his Xbox without permission. But most of the time these systems were in the game/family room. So who cared if someone else played it? We each had our own controller for each. This not only let us play together but meant neither of us had to worry about someone messing up or getting the others controller dirty. There is no negative to letting your sibling play the thing when you're not doing so if you just get her a controller of her own. Setting that boundary is just about being mean and that's something as a parent you should be teaching your kids not to do.\n\nNot to mention you should be spending the same amount (roughly) for each child. Talking about her birthday being around Christmas is ridiculous. Have you ever heard of a budget? If you won't have the money at her Birthday then spend less on his and save some of it for her. Figure out an approximate amount you can afford for each of them each year and actually plan to have that. It's alright to maybe splurge a bit beyond the budget now and then if you can afford it to give one of them a specific item you want to get them. Spending more on a milestone Birthday like a sweet 16 or 18th makes sense. But that should be the case for both of them if you're doing it for one.
