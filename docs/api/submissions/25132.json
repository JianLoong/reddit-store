You pay good money for your son to be sedentary while your daughter is getting exercise and growing new neural connections.", "Sadly, that's not a guarantee. The Golden Child often is unable to see the problem and continues to bask in their status. My sympathies for the daughter. YTA OP.", "Now YTA. You're treating your daughter likes she's lesser than and it's messed up. Shame on you.", "Why can't you buy her newer ones when you can afford it since he already has a console and computer?", "No. Your daughter should get something new. 17 year old can get a part time job.", "If you can\u2019t afford it for both your kids then both don\u2019t get those things.", "There's a simple solution to this.  Stop buying things for your son until you've given your daughter an equivalent value of things to the stuff he already has.  Stop playing the poverty card and *do the right thing* instead of making excuses for blatant favouritism.", "Why should he get allb the new stuff just because he's older? \n\nYou're exhausting.", "Then you can afford it for neither. Or you buy it and put it in a neutral space and both of them have EQUAL ownership. Your way shouldn't even be an option if you want a relationship with your daughter forever.", "You need to equally distribute that birthday money.  It's not her fault that she was born near Christmas. YTA.", "Wrong.   If her brother gets bday presents, then she should as well.", "Was there one in the house that he was actively denied access to??? Was his birthday after a holiday that made you unable to buy him lavish gifts while other people were getting gifts just fine on theirs???\n\nIf you want to compare, do it properly. Take everything into account.", "I think you meant \"I'm a shitty parent\".", "Because you have 2 kids. PS5 is not a necessity, it's a gaming device. It doesn't matter when he got it. The situation now is this: you buy him the newest PS,  your daughter doesn't receive anything even close to this so she will think that you favorite your son. Because with your approach she doesn't get anything newest and cool and expensive for herself, she gets only cast off from him. It should feel terrible. You are basically buying a very expensive toy to one of your children and tell the other that she can play with it when her brother will get a new toy next year or later. It's so terrible... Poor girl.\n\nWhen your son was her age noone had a PS5 in your family, nothing to be jealous about. And now he has it, and poor girl gets nothing. She is still a kid, you can be as rational as you like, but show some empathy and understanding. Put yourself in her shoes. In her world all cool toys are gotten by your son, nothing for her. She must feel as less loved child. And the excuses that you don't have money is ridiculous. You could easily buy 2 of PS4 for example. Or by a shared PS5 for them for Christmas.\n\nEmpathy. It is important", "That is logic to you?  He deserves you to spend more money on him because he has more years on earth?", "I'm the asshole because I can't afford 2 PS5s? She doesn't really NEED a PS5 does she?", "I might do that however I think it's normal for younger kids to get hand me downs", "That doesn't work. They used to have an xbox that was for both of them and they fought over it all the time mostly because my daughter \"didn't like sharing what is hers\" they fought so much that we took it away and decided to never buy something that is for both of them again", "Yes. You could have bought a shared PS5 with the expectation that they share\u2026if your son wants his own he\u2019s 17 he can get a job!", ">She doesn't really NEED a PS5 does she?\n\nNeither does he, but you got him one.", "You're the asshole because if you can I only afford one thing, you should make your children share.", "Your son doesn't NEED a PS5 either.\n\nIf you're going to buy a PS5, why not buy it for the FAMILY and work out a sharing schedule?\n\nYour daughter needs a computer as well. If you can't afford two, then you buy one for the family and they share.\n\nDoes your daughter also have a musical instrument?\n\nSTOP TREATING YOUR SON LIKE THE GOLDEN CHILD. If you can't afford to treat your kids equitibly by giving them BOTH special things, then buy one for BOTH of them.", "Then you buy a \"family\" PS5. Jesus you're dense.", "Does he?", "No YTA because when you can afford it he will get a new one and she will get the hand me down, when ya can afford a new one your daughter should get it not your son.", "Why would someone buy 2 PS5 when you can buy one and they share? Oh, right, because then the golden child and favourite son wouldn't like it. Ffs, get a grip!", "Do you listen to yourself? Why did you have TWO KIDS when you are willing to provide for only ONE OF THE KIDS? You call yourself a parent? That PS5 and computer HAD TO BE BOUGHT TO SHARE if you can't provide fairly for both of them. Listen to yourself: she has a phone, when our dearest boy gets the newest versions she'll get the hand-me-downs... Sorry ass of a parent you are. Reading the bs you wrote makes my blood boil. Do not have kids if you don't know how to parent them. YTA but the biggest one I've seen. How disgusting you and your husband are.", "You think it's normal to give everything to one child and a fraction of it to the other and wonder why she's acting out.", "No, it's not.    Maybe clothes when they are younger", "\nYta. You and your husband are terrible parents. Instead of fostering a good sibling relationship all your doing is making your daughter resent your son. And making you son think he is superior to your daughter.", "Just tell your daughter that you don\u2019t love her, to please stop bothering to get her stuff because it won\u2019t happen. All your money and love are for her brother, and she deserves to know that.", "It\u2019s not normal, you are just treating your son a lot better than you are treating your daughter. I feel sorry for her, having a mother like you", "Omg I hope you don't literally give your daughter everything as a hand me down, unless you are completely broke. That totally makes you a jerk. Nothing says \"i love you\" like never getting anything of your own first.", "You keep using a lot of words for \"I'm a shitty parent\".", "???? So then don't buy any of them anything extra or you buy it for both. What is wrong with you that your daughter bears all blame and responsibility and your son is this sweetheart that you claim shares SOMETIMES but also that he shouldn't have to share??? Which leads me to think you always rule in his favour when the dispute is brought to you. When do your decisions favour your daughter over your son????? Since you have no problems blatantly doing the other way around?", "So parent your children properly.", ">my daughter \"didn't like sharing what is hers\"\n\nGee. I wonder where she got that attitude? From her older brother who does that and her asshole parents that enable the behavior?\n\nOf course YTA. You obviously like your son better and don\u2019t care about your daughter\u2019s happiness anywhere near as much. If at all.", "INFO\n\nWhy did she describe the Xbox as hers?  Was it given on her birthday?", "It was a birthday gift. No one should have to \"share\" a birthday gift", "This is 2023, not the 1500s. Birth order doesn't mean anything.  She is old enough to game when her homework and chores are done (should be same for him) and she is old enough to use a computer for school and other age appropriate recreational uses.", "No she just wanted it to be hers. She didn't want to share", "If you can\u2019t afford to spend the same amount of money on both kids then you shouldn\u2019t have bought the first one", "OP, you came here asking for opinions. You want to know if YTA.If you don\u2019t like the answers you get, perhaps you shouln\u2019t have come here. \n\nMaybe listen to some of the folks here who have a suggestion or two. I\u2019m sure you can find a way to make your daughter feel she\u2019s just as important as her brother. Being the oldest does NOT entitle your son to get all the toys and electronics and fun stuff before your daughter. \n\nDO BETTER. \n\nYTA", "Just admit you don\u2019t value your daughter as much.", "How many super expensive birthday gifts has she gotten that she doesn\u2019t have to share?", "But you aren\u2019t buying your daughter equal value presents for her birthday.", "Then give them both modest birthday gifts and one lavish shared Christmas gift...", "You changed your story", "Who was the gift from?", "Look, it's simple.  If you're not disciplined enough to save money to buy your daughter presents because her birthday is too close to Christmas, then start throwing her a half birthday at a time you're able to afford it.", "And either does your son, what is the difference?", "Her"]}
