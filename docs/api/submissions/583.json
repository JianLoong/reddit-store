Me and one of my friends were going to be chips and salsa for Halloween. But today, October 30th he told me he didn't want to be chips and salsa with me anymore, and the reason for it was that his crush wanted him to go with him as scooby doo and shaggy. When he told me that it pissed me off so much, i started to argue with him and how he couldn't just ditch me the day before Halloween. He told me that i could be chips and salsa with one of our other friends, but i really don't want to do it with someone else because we had this plan for like 2-3 weeks and i was so excited for it. Now I'm not speaking with him at the moment and probably will end up not doing Halloween with him.
