We met through friends when we were 19, and I, as a young autistic guy, was excited to have a girlfriend and then a wife. We were not wealthy when we met, but I got very into computer programming and eventually was hired to some software engineering roles which paid very well, and I financially provided for us. We had similar hobbies, like enjoying the outdoors and animals. We had a nice life in rural Tennessee, where our son was born. The problem with the relationship was that we were not in love. We behaved more like friends and roommates to one another.\n\nOne time, I took our son to a fair put on by one of the local grocery chains, and Nancy did not want to go. We were having a great time at the fair trying all kinds of new food when nancy called me. She said  \u201cdon't you ever take my son without me? I told you not to go\u201d. it was at that point, I started realizing this is weird. She's super possessive. It was strange to me that she was so possessive with our son, when she was not that way with me. One time, she actually told me that it would be okay with her if I had an affair. I think she married me just because we got along and she wanted kids.\n\nEventually, I decided that I wanted out of the relationship. I thought it would be most considerate to nancy and our son to leave them with the house, one of the cars, and alimony. I thought that things would go smoothly, they did not.\n\nI left my son with my wife, and actually ended up taking my dream job in Europe, but I had visitation rights to see my son whenever I came to America and gave my wife notice. One time when I was visiting, I noticed my son was very sad, and I later learned that it was because his favorite dog had died. After talking to him more about it, he told me that my ex wife had the dog put down and told him it was because \u201cdad doesn\u2019t send enough money for dog food\u201d. She also kept evading me when I would come for my scheduled visitation.\n\nOne day I spoke with my son on the phone and told me that my ex nancy was moving. I had no idea that she was moving and our custody agreement said she would have to inform me if she planned to move. Unfortunately, she had already moved. I had to look up school records all over the area and eventually found out they moved to Pennsylvania. The divorce court held her in contempt for this.\n\nAfter a bunch of court hearings, the judge decided that I would have my son live with me in europe during the summers, and with his mother the rest of the year, but she was warned about her violation of moving away without telling the court. The year went by and when summer came around, she did not put my son on the plane for summer visitation.\n\nI had to come back to america for more court battles, and using all the evidence that she was unstable and a poor parent I won custody of my son back, and took him to europe.

Way to think of the child\u2019s well being\u2026 for his well being, you\u2019re giving him the obvious structure he needs. Not lying to him about his dog dying, or manipulating him. Unfortunately you moved to another country.. I\u2019ll never understand why people want a horrible mother over a dad, just because he\u2019s a dad. You have rights too. You didn\u2019t exactly leave her destitute, she violated court orders.. but that\u2019s ok because she\u2019s the ex wife?! Eff that shit. You did what\u2019s best for your son. But to some I guess having his life disrupted and him being traumatized by the ex wife is ok because she\u2019s a woman.

How are you getting \u2018abandon\u2019 from that?", "That sounds like an ESH because ur saying she also sucks", "I don't agree with what the ex-wife was doing to the child. She's obviously unstable and was not providing a safe environment for their kid. I also don't agree with OP moving to another continent, leaving his son behind, and not being actively involved in his son's life. \n\nMaybe if OP didn't run away to follow his dream job and abandon his son in another country, he could have provided a more stable life for his child. You know, by being a present active parent with at least 50% custody instead of being a phone call parent from 2000 miles away. \n\nThey are both assholes.\n\nThis has nothing to do with gender roles so idk wtf you're talking about with all the women nonsense.", "Leaving him in contact with an abusive psycho would hurt him far more.", "\n\n>Taking your son away from his mother will hurt him immensely\n\njust because she's his mother, doesn't make her a good one. the fact that a judge not only gave op custody but allowed him to move the kid out of the country is indicative of that.", "Just because you think all mothers should get full custody doesn't mean they actually should. She was a terrible parent, violated many custody agreement and tried to alienate the father by taking away the child's favourite thing and blaming it on him", "I\u2019d say NTA for removing his son from the situation\u2026 but he\u2019s a major ass for abandoning his son for his dream job.", "You missed the part where he said he's autistic.", "He visited only when he was in the states. That\u2019s not parenting. Parenting is a consistent schedule and meeting needs, not coming around twice a year because you decided to have an Eat, Pray, Love moment and leave your kid with your ex.

Was he flying to the U.S. every weekend?", "You had me agreeing with you mostly until that last sentence. You have been here a long time on this sub and you know that most times the voters take the woman\u2019s side regardless of the situation. You have not noticed that? Granted, taking a job overseas was not a good idea, but without knowing the full context of WHY he did.. maybe the best money he could get? I moved over 1200 miles with my kids away from my ex.. for a better offer than I could get locally because I wanted what was best for my kids financially. What\u2019s so wrong when a guy does it? My ex didn\u2019t leave me with shit.. so I had to get it on my own. His ex had a lot more than me, home, money, vehicle, support, and the child. My ex couldn\u2019t be bothered with any of those minute details. But I still give people the benefit of the doubt if I feel they are doing what\u2019s best for the child and in this case I feel he did. Most of the comments were against him because she\u2019s a single mom. Well.. so we\u2019re /are a lot of us.. now he\u2019s a single dad doing what he thinks is best for his child and some comments are all over him.. but if the shoe was on the other foot  they\u2019d be supportive of her.", "This may shock you, but autistic people are not unfeeling robots, and it's still objectively wrong to abandon your child.", "What does that have to do with anything?", "Autism isn't a pass to abandon your children wtf", "You moved over 1200 miles...WITH your kids.\n\nYou didn't abandon them with your ex.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with him taking back full custody, but he shouldn't have left his son in the first place. He was chasing a \"dream\" job, which was apparently more important than being an active presence in his son's life. I do not believe for a second that OP was so financially strapped that his only choice was to move to Europe as internationally relocating is quite an ordeal. People in poor job situations don't just get offered international work opportunities.\n\nYou know what kids need? Their parents. Present and active in their life.\n\nNo one is judging him for being a single dad. I'm judging him for choosing a job over being close to his son.\n\nI've seen some issues on this sub skewed by gender, what I'm telling you is this isn't one of them.", "That\u2019s fair enough. Agree to disagree with much respect on some points. I do agree he shouldn\u2019t have left his son in the first place, but again, I don\u2019t know what options he had either. Plus, if he\u2019d had tried to get custody to begin with, courts don\u2019t always rule in favor of the father. Regardless of the situation of the child. We all know that much. We seem to be reasonable adults, both of us, but I\u2019ve seen some serious crap go down against perfectly good fathers who worked, and the mom still got custody, even though living in squalid conditions and being abusive.. because they\u2019d know when the guardian At Lietem (spelling) was coming and fixed up their act. But I\u2019m willing to compromise and say we\u2019re both right without a doubt", "I mean, if anything, it's almost proving your point in the opposite way.\n\nI garuntee if OP was a woman who left her child with an unstable father to pursue her dream career in another country, she would be absolutely obliterated. As we all know, dad's are allowed to travel and work abroad because they are the providers, but women need to stay home with the children.\n\nThere are certainly many ways to look at it, but there is nothing in the post that suggests OP fought for his son prior to the overseas move. He explains that he decided to leave them the house, and then left the country to pursue his career.", "Very true. But I\u2019m not sure about it being a woman doing it.. I\u2019ve seen some posts to the opposite but that\u2019s ok. I certainly don\u2019t expect a woman to stay home in the kitchen if she doesn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s not what our mothers and grandmothers fought for at all. But if one or the other is a stay at home parent, they shouldn\u2019t get dogged for it. As long as the parents have a mutual respect and understanding that they are a team and help each other no matter what.", "ESH. Are you leaving out some details? Courts granted you full custody and you moved him out of his home country? What about moms visitation now? Sounds like a kidnapping the way you've stated it here. She's a piece of work too, but details.", "ESH get your kid the good therapy", "NTA\n\nYour son is the most important thing. Your ex killed their dog because...reasons that I highly suspect are not what she told your son. Your son sounds like he was unhappy and it would have affected the rest of his life.

Nancy sounds like a drag, among other things.", "NTA You gave her plenty of opportunities.", "NTA. You even have a court judgement saying that.", "You are absolutely in no way, shape, or form the asshole. From what you describe putting an entire damn ocean between him and his mother was a good call. I hope both of you enjoy all that Europe has to offer", "NTA\n\nShe was psychologically torturing your son to alienate him from you. What she did was extreme psychological abuse. You need to get him into a child psychologist immediately. I'd bet actual money that even more horrors will come to the surface that you can use to have her parental rights terminated.\n\nOp, she's unhinged and obsessed with her son. I know this sounds extreme but have a professional probe him for CSA. It's not uncommon with women who have unhealthy fixations on their children.", "NTA. You quite possibly saved your son's future.", "Nta you won ur custody battle now go spend time w ur kid. N maybe get some family counseling just for good measure", "Exactly, everything you did was legal and considering what your son was telling you was happening at home, very much needed", "I think you\u2019re confusing full custody and primary custody. He can move wherever he likes if he has full custody. If he had primary custody, the wife would get visitation or partial custody while he had majority custody. \n\nBut I agree ESH here. These two are a doozy. Her possessiveness seems abusive and he just left the baby. He knew she didn\u2019t care for him and yet he trusted her to do right by him. Seems delusional on everyone\u2019s part.", "She had his dog killed in front of him in order to alienate him from his father. She's a sick pup.", "Because their triggered head canon is more important than the actual facts, usually. \n\nNTA, op.", "Biggest facepalm I\u2019ve had all day, and it\u2019s been one of *those* days", "Imagine being pissed your ex moves states with your kid when you moved countries without them."]}
