{"id": 19734, "submission_id": "149zxsa", "title": "AITA for telling my wife to stop being a pushover or I would take away her spending privileges?", "selftext": "My wife(25F) of 5 years has a sister(20F). She\u2019s somewhat disabled, and while this may sound contradictory she has a condition which makes working difficult but not entirely impossible unless she is under stress (neurological condition, loses muscle control, makes her hit/throw stuff, fall over).\n\nI have no problem with her sister. She is sweet and nice to have around, my wife loves her more than anything. She basically raised her and stepped in when her parents wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. This has led to a relationship closer to mother daughter. My wife would constantly be paying for stuff for her sister, and this made sense to me when she was a minor and was doing much worse health wise.\n\nRecently though this has increasingly been getting under my skin. I am the sole provider for my household right now since my wife was pregnant, and only gave birth recently. We\u2019d spend a lot to buy her sister gifts for holidays, which she would never return the favor - even with something cheap with thought (or no thought) put into them. We\u2019d always take her out to events or dinner and pay for her every time. She would never even pick up the bill for herself.\n\nAgain, wasn\u2019t entirely an issue until she became an adult - and now I\u2019m fed up with it. She expects my sister to do things like pay for her to go to the doctor, or invites us out to lunch and then expects us to pay. She doesn\u2019t even schedule her own appointments, my wife takes her wherever she asks even if she has the ability to do it herself and we live 45 minutes away. She always talks about how she's freelancing and is making money, but then somehow has no money whenever she needs or wants anything.\n\nI did not have an issue with this either really. I thought my wife was being a pushover, but it's ultimately her money. Until recently. Now she's spending my money on her and it's really getting me angry. I want to spend my money on my daughter but we\u2019re spending money on this financially irresponsible leech.\n\nI explained this to my wife in a much nicer way, but we ended up in a fight where I called her sister some pretty messed up things. I ended the conversation by telling her I would take away her access to our joint bank account until she contributes again if she doesn\u2019t tell her sister to grow up and that she is not her mother, and she is no longer a child. She cannot be dependent on people forever. I think it\u2019s an important lesson for her to learn. If she doesn\u2019t learn it, she can get back to work and continue supporting her until shes 40 with her own money. Not mine.\n\nShe honestly thinks this is an end of the world situation, I think it's quite clear this is for the better. I think she's scared of hurting her sister but at this point shes crippling her by allowing her to do nothing.\n\nEDIT : I should have worded it better in my post. I just meant having the debit card and using our money on her sister. Not taking away all her access to money but setting a limit, or giving her cash so she cant just get suckered into paying for stuff. A lot of the criticism still stands despite this but I want to clarify I'm not taking away her access to all the money entirely.  \n\n\n I also understand the comments about my wife being a homemaker means she is putting in equal work so my money is her money, but we are on a single income and we can barely afford our familys needs. I cant give her half my salary so she can spend half of that on her sister. A majority of it goes to keeping us paycheck to paycheck right now.", "created_utc": 1686828405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149zxsa/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_being_a_pushover/", "score": 1264, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Despite the wording, which DID come across as asshole-y, I do get exactly what you're saying here.

Still show you care and support her (jist not financially) by still having meals and doing things together, even at your expense at first. Baby steps. Then, gradually cut back from that. Telling her not to accompany her to doctor's appointments.. eh, choose your battles here. She is still young and needs that emotional support. For now. As far as SCHEDULING the appointments...I do get your frustration there. I had to schedule all of my ex-husband's until we divorced...for 20 years...I get it. Maybe have your wife sit down with her and make a schedule and detailed lists. What needs to be scheduled and when. Provider's names, addresses, phone numbers. She may even need a written dialog to reference when calling these places--I get severe anxiety when calling places and I lose all train of thought when they answer the phone, so I understand why someone wouldn't want to do it, but it IS a life skill she needs to learn to do for herself. Make lists for talking points for each appointment so that nothing is forgotten, any questions that need to be asked. Again, I think your sister continuing to go with her (for now) may not be a bad thing at this point. She may be an adult, but she still lacks the maturity to care for herself. Let her know that she is still family, and you'll still be there for her in other ways...she may feel she is losing your sister to her growing new family...but also be helping prepare her for life as a successful and functioning member of society.", "NTA.\n\nThe sister needs to get a job!!", "NTA your wife's sister is abusing her disability, and I hate when people play the \"sick\" card and don't take responsibility of their life.

But the minute my mom noticed that her cousin didn\u2019t return the money, she herself stopped giving it away.

She\u2019s somewhat disabled, and while this may sound contradictory she has a condition which makes working difficult but not entirely impossible unless she is under stress (loses muscle control). \r  \n\r  \nI have no problem with her sister. She is sweet and nice to have around, my wife loves her more than anything. She basically raised her and stepped in when her parents wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. This has led to a relationship closer to mother daughter. My wife would constantly be paying for stuff for her sister, and this made sense to me when she was a minor and was doing much worse health wise. \r  \n\r  \nRecently though this has increasingly been getting under my skin. I am the sole provider for my household right now since my wife was pregnant, and only gave birth recently. We\u2019d spend a lot to buy her sister gifts for holidays, which she would never return the favor - even with something cheap with thought (or no thought) put into them. We\u2019d always take her out to events or dinner and pay for her every time. She would never even pick up the bill for herself.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, wasn\u2019t entirely an issue until she became an adult - and now I\u2019m fed up with it. She expects my sister to do things like pay for her to go to the doctor, or invites us out to lunch and then expects us to pay. She doesn\u2019t even schedule her own appointments, my wife takes her wherever she asks even if she has the ability to do it herself and we live 45 minutes away. She always talks about how she's freelancing and is making money, but then somehow has no money whenever she needs or wants anything.\r  \n\r  \nI did not have an issue with this either really. I thought my wife was being a pushover, but it's ultimately her money. Until recently. Now she's spending my money on her and it's really getting me angry. I want to spend my money on my daughter but we\u2019re spending money on this financially irresponsible leech.\r  \n\r  \nI explained this to my wife in a much nicer way, but we ended up in a fight where I called her sister some pretty messed up things. I ended the conversation by telling her I would take away her access to our joint bank account until she contributes again if she doesn\u2019t tell her sister to grow up and that she is not her mother, and she is no longer a child. She cannot be dependent on people forever. I think it\u2019s an important lesson for her to learn. If she doesn\u2019t learn it, she can get back to work and continue supporting her until shes 40 with her own money. Not mine. \r  \n\r  \nShe honestly thinks this is an end of the world situation, I think it's quite clear this is for the better. I think she's scared of hurting her sister but at this point shes crippling her by allowing her to do nothing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have read OP's updates and his had badly worded things in the original post, OP you cane off as controlling financally, which would understandably get everyone's back up. But I now understand what he means and his wife needs to put OP and there daughter first, they can't afford to pay for her sister who is capable of paying for herself. OP NTA. His wife shouldn't be putting them in a financial hole for her sister, it's just not right.", "Not exactly, it saves money but doesn\u2019t create it which is the key difference here. \n\nKinda like a \u201ccannot be redeemed for cash\u201d voucher, it cannot pay for SIL\u2019s lunches and OP wants the cash coming in to pay for their expenses (like their child)", "But are you giving half of the family  earned income to an adult that could work but doesn't? And then leave your family on an even tighter budget with a newborn?\n\nBecause that's what the wife is doing. She's putting her household in a financial spot, while the SIL is a capable adult who can still work with her disability.", "The money is in a joint account. And she\u2019s earned it by looking after their child so he can go to work. She is enabling him to earn the money", "Most people who don\u2019t have paid maternity leave (hi, it\u2019s me) do get 6-8 weeks paid short term disability. Which is laughable, but I\u2019m wondering because he\u2019s saying she contributes nothing, which would mean she hadn\u2019t contributed to any savings before this either. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the whole picture.", "No. Just no. I don\u2019t understand how people are okay with financial abuse.", "And you think that should be enough to pay her bills? Have you ever talked to a freelance artist??\n\nClearly y'all need to set some boundaries with her, but you're letting your anger drive the bus and you're not being logical or kind to your wife or her sister. It's going to make your wife dig in her heels and be protective of her sister, and it's a total asshole move. You need to work through your issues around this before you have another conversation or set any more \"rules.\"", "OP finding work as a freelance artist in this economy right now relies a loooot on luck, which is stressful and you mentioned stress impacts her illness. It's a bit of a downward spiral - can't find work so you're stressed which makes you ill, can't work because you're ill, which is stressful and makes you worse. She's really not getting that much money. But all that aside: it's immensely shitty to realize your wife is a pushover and immediately try to push her over. It's controlling enough to be concerning - this really wasn't a problem to you until she relied solely on you? How come?  I understand having to save money for the child, but you just should not be able to pull the rug under her and her disabled sister like that. It's shitty. You can talk about budgeting, and limiting what gets paid for, and looking into assistive services for her sister, but unless everyone's circumstances change, your wife will include her disabled sister in the budget and that's normal. You should have talked about this before you decided to have a child.", "So she can do it when she feels good enough. That\u2019s a lot different than going to an actual job.", "Have you priced 24 hour child care? You should. Have you priced having a maid come in everyday to cook and clean? You should. You are taking as much advantage of your wife as your sister is if you think she is not owed a portion of what you earn. You have a baby now. How is that baby surviving while you work?   \n\n\nIt will be hard for your wife to create a boundary when she has known nothing else her entire life with your sister-in-law. I agree she should but it should probably be done in baby steps. You should come up with a plan because changing her entire way of acting towards her sister is going to be hard for her and she already has a lot on her plate. That is where you should step up and help instead of threaten. YTA.", "All of this is still really infantilizing. She's only home to take care of your child, so this being \"your\" money is firstly wrong, and secondly temporary.\n\nYou need to have a calm discussion about this. No insulting family members or anything, just a frank discussion about how much this is stressing you out and how you can both be happy with whatever you both arrange. \n\nYou also need to apologize to your wife for the things you said about her sister. We're all assuming it was really bad if you won't state what you said here to a bunch of strangers. You can't talk about people that your wife loves that way. \n\nYTA but you don't have to continue being so.", "See that's a lot different from \"do what I'm telling you to or I'm cutting all your access to the money\" which is what it is in the post. While I have you here, care to elaborate on what the terrible things you said about her sister were? Cause the reluctance to repeat it leads I and others to believe it was some truly horrible shit in which case why do you think anyone would be willing to listen to you after you said all of that about someone they care very deeply for?", "And you're still not saying what \"messed up things\" you called her sister during your argument. Sounds like you know you may have caused some irreparable damage in your relationship.", "I\u2019m going to be super blunt - if my partner ever threatened me financially the way you have done with your wife, I would be planning my exit.\n\nYou might have irreparably damaged your marriage. You have shown her that you have the capacity for financial abuse.", "What you\u2019re doing is coercive control and that is abuse. You\u2019re an abusive husband.", "Jesus christ, did you even read my response?", "Didn\u2019t say it included the sister. But the misogynist who dirty deleted their terrible comment seemed to think the wife didn\u2019t get any say over the household money.", "That's scary.", "I am the one earning it, but because she is contributing that makes it our money. I'm wording that way to imply if she was not doing that then it would be my money. Which is what sets the sister, who does nothing for our family apart from my wife.", "If he\u2019s not a complete tool he means \u201cmoney I earned\u201d.", "She needs information like monthly income and her parents will not provide it to her - honestly I think that they are worse than my wife and try to keep her dependent. She couldnt do basic self care tasks like bathe, brush her teeth, ect until she was 13 when a therapist intervened.", "I mean, if someone is draining BOTH of your bank accounts and you now have a child and bills to pay on a single income when you\u2019re used to two, you kinda gotta do what you gotta do. \n\nIs he supposed to start missing bills and rent just so he doesn\u2019t get called an asshole by his wife and Reddit?", "So we should enable gambling addicts too?", "The parent comment of this thread addressed that", "Yeah, but we are also assuming the wife doesn\u2019t have any neurological issues and can be reasoned with. Having him say, \u201cif you don\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t have this\u201d is absurd. He should be able to sit her down and talk to her about finances and they could come to a conclusion together.", "I\u2019m not saying what she\u2019s doing is right but the answer isn\u2019t to sever her access to money that\u2019s legally and morally hers", "She hasn't \"earned\" them , unfortunately.  That's why you never leave your job ( have no savings) and become dependent  on a man", "Hmm. I apologize for not being clear. I wasn't saying financial abuse is ok. I'm addressing your comment rather than OP here. \n\nI'm saying that lunch out for three people isn't in everyone's budget right now, even occasionally", "I have to assume most people have absolutely no experience with it. Otherwise it\u2019s a horrifying attitude to have.", "She doesn\u2019t pay bills, her parents pay for all of them. She\u2019s just using her sister for fun money when she already has her own from her job.", "He is still saying he would take away her debit card and just give her cash. That\u2019s super fucking controlling.", "Why can\u2019t you answer the question?", "I did and it was gross.", "Did you answer their question? How much money would you be out hiring a nanny/daycare and maid? The money you would be paying a nanny and maid (if she\u2019s taking over all chores), that would be her \u201cwage\u201d. \nYou are dependent on her to clean the house and watch your child, probably even cook most meals if we are going by traditional household measures. \n\nSo you would also be pretty dependent on her as well. Financially dependent on her contributions. It\u2019s her money too. Everyday that she is taking care of home and baby, is a day she earns access to that joint account.", "Jesus christ, did you ever stop to consider you\u2019re being a controlling AH to a woman who, in the long run, is saving YOU money?\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be irritated at her, but you went about it so wrong that you dipped into financially abusive territory.", "I feel like when you start using the household money recklessly, so that you have no more money to buy things for your closer family (your daughter) then restricting your spending abilities until you get your priorities straight back then it's not an ah action. Saying she should have no access to the money is wrong, but what she's doing is not right either.", "Yes, it's one of the many reasons why our abortion rights being taken away is so terrifying.", "Red flags all over here. Do her doctors know about this? At this point, I\u2019d be calling adult protective services to see if they\u2019d intervene. They won\u2019t teach her life skills, they won\u2019t provide her with health care, and she doesn\u2019t have the means to work enough to support herself. Something is very off, and I\u2019m worried about abuse.", "and that was not related to her disability.", "It\u2019s fun when people pick and choose what part of the story they want to follow. He literally said he wasn\u2019t cutting her off completely. Just giving her an allowance. Which is completely understandable since the wife seems more concerned with \u201cmothering\u201d her sister instead of her family. I have an 18 month old and I would never put my spouse in that position. I can\u2019t begin to imagine the stress he must feel. Sole financial provider for his newly growing family AND leech of a SIL. I agree with OP, if she wants to continue paying/doing everything for her sister, she should get a job. Question though, as their child gets older, who will take priority? Child or sister? From what OP says, SIL can\u2019t even be bothered to make her own dr appointments.", "He's limiting her access. Something needs to give & wake her up before they lose everything. I remember being on leave & one income. It was so bad that I used our Credit card for every gorecery run for 3 months. \n\nMy FIL has to do the same thing for his wife, who has a shopping addiction. She either has cash, or he can set a spending limit on her debit card.  If I was the hubby I wouldn't let her see her sister until she grows up & becomes the adult she should be.", "What\u2019s the answer then? You make money for your family but your family member gives it to someone else and won\u2019t stop even after several arguments. What do you do?", "Eh, I'd say it really depends on the amount he's setting as the limit. Taking away the debit card is controlling but it's also well known that some people have a hard time limiting themselves when using cards cause you don't really see the money leaving your wallet, I know at least personally I and some friends are better budgeting with cash than when we leave it all on the card. That's when it comes to, what is the limit he wants to set and is he following that limit for his own purchases? Let's say for ease of numbers that he makes 64,000/year, that'd be around 5,000/monthly after taxes, say rent and other necessary bills are $2500 and they're saving another $1000 on top of that giving $1500 left, if hes planning on only giving her $100-500 of that as spending money and keeping the rest as spending money for himself than he's an asshole. As long as she has access to half of the money left after bills I don't really see the problem in it being in cash vs on a card, especially if the wife is spending way more than half of that whole remaining balance (not half of the wife half but like all of her half and then some) on the sister.", "He shouldn't have the right to 'restrict here spending' though", "I don't understand how that's a thing.\nHow can the government inforce this without breeching human rights act.\n\nWhat's with America and weird provebtion laws (first achool now abortion. ((although alcohol should be classed as an illagel drug so)).)", "I doubt he\u2019s thinking of cashing out that much. It sounds like he\u2019s putting her on a cash allowance which\u2026 is pure ick. I\u2019m the breadwinner and I would never treat my spouse like that, even when he\u2019s planning on buying his disabled adult brother a gaming laptop that the man absolutely does not need. I just factor it into our gifts budget so we have to decide do we want to decrease the overall limit for everyone else to provide that to his brother, or do we want to give him a gift card to put toward a gaming laptop, etc. There are ways of budgeting that don\u2019t involve being an AH.", "When she's spending money for her sister instead of her daughter, then yes, he should. \nHer sister doesn't need all the money, she should become independent, while their daughter has no chance for that and should be prioritized in this situation.", "The amount doesn't matter really as long as it's at least half of the left over money after bills are paid. Once again I really don't see the problem with it being cash as long as shes getting the same amount to spend as what he sets for himself to spend. If they're on a tight budget I can get why he wants her to stick to the budget and not spend out of their means for her sister. For a lot of people it's way easier to budget with cash so as long as shes getting the same amount to spend on stuff as he is setting for himself to spend on stuff I don't see what the problem is on it being on a piece of plastic vs cash if the cash would actually help the wife budget better. With cards it's really easy to spend and spend and then not realize how much you actually spent until its over drafted, if the wife is doing that is understand wanting to limit card use and switch it to cash than risk going into debt cause the sister wants to eat out at restaurants."]}
