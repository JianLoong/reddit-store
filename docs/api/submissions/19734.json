{"id": 19734, "submission_id": "149zxsa", "title": "AITA for telling my wife to stop being a pushover or I would take away her spending privileges?", "selftext": "My wife(25F) of 5 years has a sister(20F). She\u2019s somewhat disabled, and while this may sound contradictory she has a condition which makes working difficult but not entirely impossible unless she is under stress (neurological condition, loses muscle control, makes her hit/throw stuff, fall over).\n\nI have no problem with her sister. She is sweet and nice to have around, my wife loves her more than anything. She basically raised her and stepped in when her parents wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. This has led to a relationship closer to mother daughter. My wife would constantly be paying for stuff for her sister, and this made sense to me when she was a minor and was doing much worse health wise.\n\nRecently though this has increasingly been getting under my skin. I am the sole provider for my household right now since my wife was pregnant, and only gave birth recently. We\u2019d spend a lot to buy her sister gifts for holidays, which she would never return the favor - even with something cheap with thought (or no thought) put into them. We\u2019d always take her out to events or dinner and pay for her every time. She would never even pick up the bill for herself.\n\nAgain, wasn\u2019t entirely an issue until she became an adult - and now I\u2019m fed up with it. She expects my sister to do things like pay for her to go to the doctor, or invites us out to lunch and then expects us to pay. She doesn\u2019t even schedule her own appointments, my wife takes her wherever she asks even if she has the ability to do it herself and we live 45 minutes away. She always talks about how she's freelancing and is making money, but then somehow has no money whenever she needs or wants anything.\n\nI did not have an issue with this either really. I thought my wife was being a pushover, but it's ultimately her money. Until recently. Now she's spending my money on her and it's really getting me angry. I want to spend my money on my daughter but we\u2019re spending money on this financially irresponsible leech.\n\nI explained this to my wife in a much nicer way, but we ended up in a fight where I called her sister some pretty messed up things. I ended the conversation by telling her I would take away her access to our joint bank account until she contributes again if she doesn\u2019t tell her sister to grow up and that she is not her mother, and she is no longer a child. She cannot be dependent on people forever. I think it\u2019s an important lesson for her to learn. If she doesn\u2019t learn it, she can get back to work and continue supporting her until shes 40 with her own money. Not mine.\n\nShe honestly thinks this is an end of the world situation, I think it's quite clear this is for the better. I think she's scared of hurting her sister but at this point shes crippling her by allowing her to do nothing.\n\nEDIT : I should have worded it better in my post. I just meant having the debit card and using our money on her sister. Not taking away all her access to money but setting a limit, or giving her cash so she cant just get suckered into paying for stuff. A lot of the criticism still stands despite this but I want to clarify I'm not taking away her access to all the money entirely.  \n\n\n I also understand the comments about my wife being a homemaker means she is putting in equal work so my money is her money, but we are on a single income and we can barely afford our familys needs. I cant give her half my salary so she can spend half of that on her sister. A majority of it goes to keeping us paycheck to paycheck right now.", "created_utc": 1686828405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149zxsa/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_being_a_pushover/", "score": 10574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Despite the wording, which DID come across as asshole-y, I do get exactly what you're saying here.

Still show you care and support her (jist not financially) by still having meals and doing things together, even at your expense at first. Baby steps. Then, gradually cut back from that. Telling her not to accompany her to doctor's appointments.. eh, choose your battles here. She is still young and needs that emotional support. For now. As far as SCHEDULING the appointments...I do get your frustration there. I had to schedule all of my ex-husband's until we divorced...for 20 years...I get it. Maybe have your wife sit down with her and make a schedule and detailed lists. What needs to be scheduled and when. Provider's names, addresses, phone numbers. She may even need a written dialog to reference when calling these places--I get severe anxiety when calling places and I lose all train of thought when they answer the phone, so I understand why someone wouldn't want to do it, but it IS a life skill she needs to learn to do for herself. Make lists for talking points for each appointment so that nothing is forgotten, any questions that need to be asked. Again, I think your sister continuing to go with her (for now) may not be a bad thing at this point. She may be an adult, but she still lacks the maturity to care for herself. Let her know that she is still family, and you'll still be there for her in other ways...she may feel she is losing your sister to her growing new family...but also be helping prepare her for life as a successful and functioning member of society.", "NTA.\n\nThe sister needs to get a job!!", "NTA your wife's sister is abusing her disability, and I hate when people play the \"sick\" card and don't take responsibility of their life.

I would also encourage separate accounts for spending on non-immediate family members, such as my parents, if I had to spend on them, I would spend on my own money. THIS IS WHY I WROTE WHAT I DID. Because in my opinion joint account should only be for the shared household and immediate family. But literally everyone wants to jump on the first sentence without reading the rest so I deleted it! I hope you\u2019re all happy!!\n\nAnd before anyone gets pressed again! I\u2019m a woman, my mom was a SAHM and we were never discouraged to spend money on things for us, or gifts. But if my mom wanted to lend money to give it to her cousin or aunt, she would discuss it with my dad first!! He never once discouraged her at ANY POINT!!! But the minute my mom noticed that her cousin didn\u2019t return the money, she herself stopped giving it away. My dad actually still wanted to, she didn\u2019t, because for her IT WAS MY DAD\u2019S HARD EARNED MONEY. \n\nSo honestly, I\u2019m done.

She\u2019s somewhat disabled, and while this may sound contradictory she has a condition which makes working difficult but not entirely impossible unless she is under stress (loses muscle control). \r  \n\r  \nI have no problem with her sister. She is sweet and nice to have around, my wife loves her more than anything. She basically raised her and stepped in when her parents wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t. This has led to a relationship closer to mother daughter. My wife would constantly be paying for stuff for her sister, and this made sense to me when she was a minor and was doing much worse health wise. \r  \n\r  \nRecently though this has increasingly been getting under my skin. I am the sole provider for my household right now since my wife was pregnant, and only gave birth recently. We\u2019d spend a lot to buy her sister gifts for holidays, which she would never return the favor - even with something cheap with thought (or no thought) put into them. We\u2019d always take her out to events or dinner and pay for her every time. She would never even pick up the bill for herself.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, wasn\u2019t entirely an issue until she became an adult - and now I\u2019m fed up with it. She expects my sister to do things like pay for her to go to the doctor, or invites us out to lunch and then expects us to pay. She doesn\u2019t even schedule her own appointments, my wife takes her wherever she asks even if she has the ability to do it herself and we live 45 minutes away. She always talks about how she's freelancing and is making money, but then somehow has no money whenever she needs or wants anything.\r  \n\r  \nI did not have an issue with this either really. I thought my wife was being a pushover, but it's ultimately her money. Until recently. Now she's spending my money on her and it's really getting me angry. I want to spend my money on my daughter but we\u2019re spending money on this financially irresponsible leech.\r  \n\r  \nI explained this to my wife in a much nicer way, but we ended up in a fight where I called her sister some pretty messed up things. I ended the conversation by telling her I would take away her access to our joint bank account until she contributes again if she doesn\u2019t tell her sister to grow up and that she is not her mother, and she is no longer a child. She cannot be dependent on people forever. I think it\u2019s an important lesson for her to learn. If she doesn\u2019t learn it, she can get back to work and continue supporting her until shes 40 with her own money. Not mine. \r  \n\r  \nShe honestly thinks this is an end of the world situation, I think it's quite clear this is for the better. I think she's scared of hurting her sister but at this point shes crippling her by allowing her to do nothing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Many meetings & phone calls. It all triggers anxiety. (And many of them are disabled for psych reasons. Built-in excuse.) So they don't do it. I know, because my daughter is 18 & her level of disability is such that she can do none of it. It's me.

You\u2019re basically dependent on the kindness of your employer if they\u2019re a small business, and that realistically boils down to how difficult it would be to replace you. Companies of all sizes also (usually though not always) may offer short term disability, which pays 50%-70% of your salary for 6-8 weeks depending on your type of labor. Even that usually requires taking your earned PTO (1-2 weeks) so this benefit is short-changed, and it still must overlap with the unpaid leave. Very few large companies offer actual parental leave as a benefit and even some of those offer less or no leave for fathers.", "Often enough, you need to be working full time for a company for a certain amount of time before you become eligible for full benefits. It also matters if you\u2019re salary, contractor, hourly, etc. Full time salary workers are generally eligible and hourly workers are eligible after a certain amount of hours.

The brain powers the body and when it gets stressed, you may not have control over the signals it is sending. Like many disabilities, Tourette\u2019s is a spectrum. It is not yelling out random cuss words whenever like some people think. Physical tics can make physical jobs tough and can even injure the person depending on the severity. Verbal tics can make holding down a job difficult depending on what they are and when they happen. And stress 100% makes tics worse. It also sounds like from your description there may be other cognitive or mental health issues at play which can exacerbate the issue.\n\nIt would be nice to say that employers would be willing to accommodate as often people with disabilities can do jobs with just a little accommodation, but most don\u2019t. They will say they do, but then will find reasons to not hire, decrease hours, etc. And most entry level jobs are very physical, which if she has physical tics will make them more difficult for her. If they\u2019re not physical, they may be things like call center work which can be difficult if she has verbal tics.

OP has every right to limit his wife's expenditures, whatever they are.", "Most of the commenters are like 18 years old throwing terminology around and feeling smart about it.", "They're going in circles now lol.", "The sister hits and throws things when she's under strain. I'm not sure I'd hire her as a sitter. \n\nMake some other arrangement.", "Could be. OP waffles back and forth on the extent of her disability. He says she can work, but then makes it sound like she\u2019ll pass out or assault someone or cause property damage if she gets stressed out. If it\u2019s really the latter, she\u2019s going to have a hard time finding gainful employment for any length of time. I also question how much money she\u2019s really making with these art commissions she does. To me it just sounds like she could be exaggerating. \n\nRegardless of all that, this boils down to a relationship issue between OP and his wife: Is the wife willing to continue putting her sister before the needs of her husband and daughter?", "Your not wrong but there is only so much that case worker can do if someone\n\nA, Does not fit into the exact categories to get all the needed services\n\nB, Is waiting on huge lines of people that will take years\n\nMost disabled (or partially disabled) people that cant work much will need family to have any decent quality of life, there's no getting around it.", "This is a great comment that touches on the bigger issue here. Even if his wife wasn't spending money on the sister going from 2 incomes to 1 and adding another mouth to feed to the house hold requires a budgeting and finances discussion. \n\nMy wife and I had the same realization. She became a stay at home mom (which is a way harder job than mine and I commend her for it) but that meant our income went down by about 30%. Yes most of that would have gone to daycare even if she didn't step away so we would have had to make budget changes no matter what but that needs to be talked about and transparent to both people in the relationship. \n\nBefore kids I just handled all of the finances because my wife didn't want to so it was effectively hidden from her how I budgeted and where I was saving money for what things but as soon as we \"lost\" 30% of our total income we had to make changes and to make that clear being way more transparent about the money was necessary. In the beginning I just sort of said \"hey we need to rein in spending a bit we had to dip into the rainy day fund to pay a bill\" but that didn't really have an effect. Sitting down with the budget for a bit and talking through it helped us both align on needs vs wants.", "Yeah and OP never said anything when the wife spent money on her sister even though it should've probably been saved up for the baby.

(It's over when YOU say it's over- 'I ended the conversation' not 'we came to a resolution')\n\n- YOU issued an ultimatum, insinuating that your wife's contributions are meaningless compared to yours, despite her 'giving birth recently' and being unable to do so\n\n- Even in your edit you clarify, you're not taking it away, you just want full control over what she can and cannot do with YOUR money.\n\nThese things absolutely constitute financial abuse. End of story. Now, that being said-\n\nWhile I personally feel it's absolutely justified to take care of your daughter and 'your family' first, you said yourself that you're wife's relationship with her sister has some parent/child tones to it- and by your own admission you said some \"pretty messed up things\" about her. So not only are you threatening/participating in financial abuse, you're attacking her family. \n\nI'm not going to speak directly on the wife and sister. I will say that I agree with you about the support being above and beyond what is needed, but we also have to consider that there's a large amount of family trauma that led to the situation. I also feel like maybe it's not your place to interject into that relationship. Its definitely not your place to teach her adult sister a lesson that you feel she needs to learn (Even if you're absolutely right about it). But on that same note, it's not your responsibility to finance it.\n\nYou may have done too much damage here by directly attacking her sister. It's going to be difficult having a meaningful conversation about this moving forward because any reasonable restrictions are likely going to be framed in your personal issues as opposed to financial issues.\n\nESH. Even though I feel your motivation and priorities are in the right place, you're definitely being an asshole about it. Hopefully it hasn't sabotaged a more productive resolution.

You for acting like the woman who gave birth and is raising your child isn't contributing; I suppose you could have meant financially, but especially online without non-verbal cues and tone you need to be careful about what you say. Though hearing you said some messed up stuff about her sister, I'd guess you're not often careful about what you say. Somewhat disabled is still disabled up until you are entirely incapable of work; at which point you would typically need a caregiver. Otherwise, like everyone else, there are good days and bad days.

Are their parents living? I am the oldest child and it was ingrained in me growing up that I was responsible for my brothers, especially the youngest one who had a learning disability. My mom babied him her entire life. After she died he ended up addicted to pain medication which led to a car accident and a TBI and at this point he is living alone on disability in liw income housing. He\u2019s twice divorced and only has contact with one of his three children. He used to ask me for money and favors continuously. It\u2019s a constant struggle for me to say no and set boundaries and at one point the situation with him was the biggest issue in my marriage- my husband felt the same way you do and is also the sole breadwinner. I\u2019ve come to mostly recognize the difference between caretaking and actually helping him but it\u2019s been hard and I\u2019ll be honest every time he needs something I still struggle with saying no even when I know it\u2019s the right answer. I encourage you to talk more about this situation with your wife when emotions aren\u2019t running hot and figure out why she feels so responsible for her sister and if talking to someone (therapist) could help her recognize healthy vs unhealthy caretaking.

It\u2019s not his $ or her $ it\u2019s their money, it became their $ when they got married.  Be wise about your $ and talk with your wife about boundaries with her sister.

And as someone who isn't part of the household, this includes the sister.\n\nMaybe it's time the parents did their job instead of expecting your wife to do it for them.

And have their own kids!\n\nPerhaps you can tell your wife that the compromise is she can help pay for medical emergencies that her sister cannot afford should one come up, but that you both need to agree to it. \n\nAlso, I would remind your wife that she\u2019s more than welcome to help her sister in non financial ways.. If your wife wants to help her sister schedule appointments- that\u2019s her choice. It sounds like the likes to stay busy and maybe that\u2019s what she likes to do. But to spend your guys money on her sister for ongoing things and especially non necessities isn\u2019t acceptable. \n\nYour wife is also capable of getting a job and supporting her sister if that\u2019s what she wants to do.  You are making money to support your immediate family. That doesn\u2019t include a sister that is capable of making money. Period. Also , if her sister is that medically dependent and disabled she should sign herself up for disability and food stamps etc. There are many jobs out there, however, that it sounds like she is capable of doing with some sort of ADA accommodation - and perhaps using a wheelchair if she\u2019s falling over. \n\nLastly, since Christmas and gifts are an issue - set a limit for everyone coming up. My husband and I have a one gift rule with a cap on each person - so it\u2019s fair and reasonable. Example: siblings get a $50 gift and $10 worth of stuff in stockings. You should set a limit for gifts and make it universally applied - so that your wife doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s an attack on her sister.\n\nAnother option- have a joint account for family and then each of you can get a certain amount for personal spending. Your wife can choose to put her personal amount towards her sister if she chooses.", "NTA I\u2019ve read your replies and edits. Have you thought about a budget meeting with your wife? Basically one or both of you lay out all your earnings and expenses on a spreadsheet. Mark necessary ones like utilities, mortgage/rent etc vs discretionary spending. And start the conversation from there. With data like that, it will be easier for your wife to see how you can\u2019t afford to keep spending like this and something has to give. Stick to the data and leave emotions about the sister out of the discussion. \n\nDoes she know you\u2019ve been skipping meals just so she and the baby have food? I can\u2019t imagine she would continue to spend on her sister knowing you\u2019re going hungry.", "Fuck no. The wife does have a say, but in this particular situation, the husband is just looking out for the financial security of the two. If the wife or husband had a gambling problem, are you still gonna pull that \u201ccOnTrOl hER\u201d card? Fuck outta here", "Youre braindead. His wife is squandering their income. They should just go broke so she can let her sister do nothing? Super fucking stupid take you have.", "She\u2019s not playing the sick card, she\u2019s fucking disabled.", "Conversations amongst equals require a basic level of understanding that his wife utterly fails to meet.", "Children are not allowed to babysit of use the stove by themselves. An able adult being cut off and treated like a child is abusive. He thinks her spending is childish the should make a financial plan together - and she has a say in it, independent of who's the source of money.", "Depending on what kind of freelance work and how long she's been doing it, it might really not be all that much. When I started, my good months were like 100-300 bucks, and it was a shit ton of underpaid work, but it's what I could do at the moment. Now almost a year later, I'm starting to get the good gigs. \n\nAlso, people frequently lowball freelancers all the time. Both me and my bf work freelance (I write/edit, he's a voice actor) and both of us face the same issues of job postings having ridiculously low budgets for the work you're doing. We both decline them, but a lot of people will take them anyway, and that way job posters can continue lowballing because someone will always be desperate enough to take the job.\n\nSo yeah, I highly doubt the sister is earning all that well. But freelancing might be one of the few options that accommodates her disability. I picked up freelancing because all my employed work experiences were *awful*, and with my mental health, I like being able to have control over my workload at a given moment.", "Yes it's THEIR money, so the wife does NOT get to unilaterally decide to spend money, they need for their new born, on her adult, non dependant sister.\nThey're living paycheck to paycheck and OP is skipping meals to pay for diapers, because his wife refuses to stop spending money on her sister even AFTER he asked her nicely not to do it.", "If it's their money why is OP's wife freely spending it on her sister with no consideration of position it puts the family in? They went from a 2 income household to a 1 income household and she's continuing to spend money on her adult sister with no adjustments. Why's is OP's wife acting like it's her money to do with as she pleases?", "Oh no, if only they'd foreseen this exact situation and discussed it 9 months ahead of time... Instead, OP says nothing, then becomes furious that his wife continues supporting her sister like she always has.", "I dont even have a family, and I'm 22 living on my own. These are grown ass adults who have no comprehension of expenses, and it blows my mind. Probably jobless too by choice. I'd be LIVID if someone was using my hard earned money to spend on an adult that's too lazy to get a job. Even when I saw the title of this post, I was automatically on the wife's side until I actually read the post. I don't blame OP I would've cut off her spending too and gave her enough cash to get groceries and a little extra for herself, so there's not a lot of room to spend on the sister. Living paycheque to paycheque is brutal, If she can't handle her spending, then he has every right to take financial control of the money she's abusing. Even when I was having spending problems a couple years back I just cut off all my online banking and debit cards, so it forced me to drive 30 minutes to pull out cash if I ran out of money. I hate going to banks, so I was actually able to get control of my shit that way. The fact that people on this app think it's controlling to push someone you care about to do that says a lot.", "You don't understand. She's a woman, so right, and he's a man, so obvuously he's wrong.", "All the people saying to split the leftover money...\n\nLike, if you are living paycheck to paycheck you don't have leftover money. That's the whole point.\n\nHe's skipped meals and had issues buying diapers.\n\nOf course he's really mad.\n\nHe's described things badly, but has corrected saying he'd give her a debit card for the month or pay period and pay their bills and buy food and she doesn't have access to that main account. She spent all their savings. He can't buy diapers at times. Clearly, in the short term they need to radically shift before they end up homeless.\n\nThey can't keep living like this and paying for someone else when they can't support their family.\n\nThere'd be no question if she was buying LuLaRoe and MaryKay as 'an investment,' or going out with a friend, or doing online shopping, or gambling.

The codependency is irrelevant.\n\nShe is actively putting her family at risk of homlessness and impacting their ability to feed themselves.\n\nShe could be helping her sister get various disability applications put in. She could be taking her sister to the food bank. She could be working with the parents to get her into various aid programs. She's taking her out to eat for lunch as her husband skips meals.\n\nThey need to change spending and get savings again. Immediately. Then, they need to address the completely unsustainable behavior between her and her sister. Then OP is in or out, depending on how that goes. He can't live like this.", "But they have a sickness which leaves them able to go down to no income at the drop of a hat. You reproduced and brought a child into a burning world for your own vanity. Her sister should be supported by the system, but she isn't, your wife is being amazing and helping her, that was not a surprise to you, so when your child is put in the same place, that's solely on you and your wife.

This is how you FEEL, not the reality of the situation.", "The only reason he is an AH here is because he wasn't an AH earlier on when he married someone with a parasite (in his eyes). People forget that being an AH becomes so important in survival situations (paycheck to paycheck) that it reverses it.", "I didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t willing to provide for his family. I still think eventually it will breed resentment. If they\u2019re already living worse than paycheck to paycheck (OP is choosing between having to eat and buy diapers), eventually they may need her income to supplement them in some capacity. Also, the sister\u2019s parents aren\u2019t likely to give her free room and board forever. This isn\u2019t just an issue while OP\u2019s wife is on maternity leave. They need to have a long term plan as to how they will handle expenses for the sister going forward.", "NTA. You are starting a family and every dollar you guys have should be invested for your own future. You and your wife aren't responsible for her sister's financial well being.\n\nMy wife is Filipino and when we got married we bought a home and moved into it. Pretty much every penny was going into the house as it was a fixer upper, until I noticed that she was sending 500 a month to the Philippines. I asked her who is she sending this money too, she said her family back in the Philippines. I asked why, she said that is what they are supposed to do. I had a big problem with this, simply because she was sending this to her mom(superintendent of her district), her brother(professor with masters in business), and her sister(who flunked out of law school). All of her family had jobs and they were using the money she was sending them to go on vacations and I would see the pictures on facebook and family chats.\n\nI told her you shouldn't be sending any money back home and she got very angry and hurt. I explained that we need every penny going into the house, she had student debt, and we had other debts and between the house and the repairs we are actually not even saving. \n\nI explained where we can go if we stay with the budget and how we can build our future. But she sending this money to someone that doesn't need it and is adult enough to take care of themselves is just going to set us back instead of moving us forward.\n\nShe agreed to stop, after enough time her family stopped asking for money. It became normal for her to just say no as she saw the value we were building.\n\nJust like your wife, my wife has a very agreeable personality. It took years to teach her how to say no. Some people just never learned to say no and the guilt they feel is crippling to them. \n\nI 100% agree with you that your wife is not only not helping her sister, but she is crippling her. As someone with a long list health complications, I can assure you that everyone is way more resilient than everyone thinks they are. You have no idea what you can survive and until you learn that then you will never grow up.\n\nBut I wouldn't take away her access to any money, I would just confront her every time she sends money to her sister and ask why she did it, and then give a long list of what that money could have been used for. I would also bring it up with your in-laws who should be the one financially responsible for their own daughter, and I wouldn't let it go until it all stops. \n\nIt takes a lot of work in a marriage to set boundaries between in-laws and your new family. It might take years and it will only benefit your own family. The only way to accomplish it is with lots of communication and talks of future plans and ignoring the past.", "NTA  I guess I come from a different mindset. I am a divorced single lady, (57). Words can sometimes get jumbled and thus don't always go from the brain to the pen in the way that is socially acceptable. I completely understand him.

People have been hurt in the past and pregnancy/new motherhood is a vulnerable time for a lot of woman. Some men do try to control their spouse by restricting their income.

But until the wife sees it....", "Is it really controlling if he\u2019s making the decision to protect their financial wellbeing?\n\nIf one person is being idiotic and not thinking about the repercussions and the other sees it and is trying to correct it before they go broke, is it really controlling? \n\nOr would looking out for the family when one party is acting reckless be more appropriate?", "Just like they can\u2019t afford childcare.
