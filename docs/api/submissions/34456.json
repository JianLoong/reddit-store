This is a mild YTA. Not wanting to eat a dairy dish as someone who is lactose intolerant is legitimate, and while forgetting about it sucks, it doesn't make you an asshole, especially because you made it right. However, you need to recognize that she has every right to determine how much lactose she is willing to ingest, and what specific lactose items she is willing to join the family with at the cost of her own discomfort. She has 0 obligation to force herself into even more discomfort in order to eat the lasagna, and you shouldn't take offense from her being willing to lactose herself for a sweet treat, but not for a full meal.\n\nThat being said, she could have been more courteous and asked for a lactose free option while you were still preparing the meal, and it was extremely considerate of you to do that for her.\n\nWhat really makes yta is that you are taking offense to her choosing a dessert as the item she is willing to suffer in order to eat, rather than just accepting the appreciation you got for going out of your way to offer her a dairy free option.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
