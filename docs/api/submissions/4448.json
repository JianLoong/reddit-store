It's unreasonable for him to expect you to go to a party when you're in considerable pain, and it's not okay for him to make you feel guilty about it. He could have gone without you, so he shouldn't make you feel bad for not going. I'm sorry that happened :/", "NTA. He has a right to be disappointed; that must be an awful feeling to be missing out on something that he probably thought would bring him and his coworkers closer together.. but it\u2019s not okay that he\u2019s mistreating you over it. He could\u2019ve gone without you if it was that big of a deal.", "NTA \nCramps are the worst, and you're almost certainly having a worse day than he is! He's being a complete AH to you, and you don't deserve it!", "NTA, and from me to him:  Hey, pal, let a donkey kick you in the stomach every few seconds for a couple hours and then \"suck it up.\"\n\nWhy couldn't he have just gone?  If he can't go to a work function without you, that's a him problem.  Not a you problem.", "Not at all. My husband skipped my first company Christmas party with him due to anxiety.\nWhy would he be uncomfortable with HIS coworkers?\nYou were ill whether from cramps or the flu. His passive aggressive behavior is TA. He is an adult with a good job. I guarantee you that there are always plenty of coworkers who don't have a plus one but go and have fun. Actually the most fun parties are usually without plus ones because there are no awkward introductions, people struggling to remember names or if someone is your boss or not.\nPeople get sick.  Look closely at this behavior.  If he's doing this over a company Christmas party imagine if you have children and he has to take off from work or miss his siblings wedding? BTW, my then 4 year old niece started running a fever the day before my sister's wedding.  She was the flower girl. She wanted to go to the wedding and wear her pretty dress and have her flowers.  My brother and SIL brought her for the church. My SIL took her home right after.  My brother went to the reception just long enough to be in the bridal party photos and then home. No one felt bad. Actually it's one of those good memories of my family coming together for one another. \nIf you can't be sure your spouse has your back, really think about your future.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t want to go to a social event because you were uncomfortable and not feeling well. You told he could go without you. \n\nHe decided that he didn\u2019t want to go without you that\u2019s his choice to make. I would have said N A H if he was disappointed and a grown up about it but he\u2019s blaming you for his own choice and giving you the silent treatment and deliberately acting in a way to make you feel bad which is really childish.", "NTA. He made a choice not to go. He can be disappointed sometimes but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "NTA.  My husband has been working for the same awesome employer, with coworkers he really enjoys, for 8 years.  I\u2019ve made it to 2 office Christmas parties of the last 6 (no party in 2020), including missing the first, and neither of us is going to this year\u2019s.  Everyone is pleased when I can make it, but I have medical issues (including being immunosuppressed, which is why neither of us went last year and won\u2019t go this year), so I\u2019m often not feeling well enough to go.  It\u2019s a shame, but that\u2019s life.", "NTA. It was his choice not to go. If your monthlies are kicking your arse, you're fully entitled to look after yourself.  This wasn't your party but his. He could have gone by himself.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to bail on a party because of pain. (You might want to find the AITA query from earlier today in which the spouse went to the company party and got trashed\u2014it could be worse!)", "You didn't feel well enough to attend, I have terrible cramps, and I understand; sometimes I can just deal, and other times just remaining standing can take all my energy. Your husband was likely stressed over this party and wanted to make a good impression; you said the job is new. It sounds like the party is a big deal, you planned your appearance for weeks, and you both put a lot of expectations on this party. He is allowed to be disappointed; he is also allowed not to be in the mood to talk. Some people need time to process when upset or have learned to wait, so they don't say hurtful/wrong things in the moment. You said you appreciated his decision to stay home with you, he may feel like he was guilted into missing the party.\n\nSo this may be N A H, depending on if your husband just needs some time and is being quiet as a way to deal with his feelings or if he is actually giving you the silent treatment.", "NTA \n\nHes acting like a child. I don't know him but I don't like him", "NTA, he\u2019s being oddly sexist. A husband in 2022 who doesn\u2019t understand that women sometimes have to miss work or social events because of bad menstrual cramps/pain is out of touch with his wife in ways that are not typical in this generation. He owes you an apology.", "NTA I hear you, on my first day of menses it\u2019s so uncomfortable to go anywhere, and my husband knows it, he doesn\u2019t force me to go anywhere and usually it\u2019s me forcing myself. I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty, he is overreacting. Just go to bed with a heating pad and let him sulk. He\u2019ll get over it.", "Tell him you wish he could get cramps and see if he feels like going to a party.", "I would have gone. I would have taken something and sucked it up. But hey.. that\u2019s just me.", "YTA. \n\nPeriod cramps are no joy, but unless you have a debilitating condition - rather than just being \"super uncomfy\" - you should have been able to suck it up.  You know this meant a lot to your husband, and supposedly even to you, so letting a period stand in your way is nothing short of wimpy.  And you just know, next time you have your period and decide to do something YOU want to do anyway, your husband will notice.  Double up with tampons and pads (surely there's a loo at the party where you can change on the regular...?), don't wear white pants, and you should be good.", "I would have gone but it all depends on how bad your periods are. My sister throws up from pain every month and has to continue going to work etc. I understand this was an optional event but your husband has seen women have to suck it up and not slow down for their periods his whole life, as society doesn't typically allow for this.

OP, \n\nNTA\n\nThis is baffling to me, to say the least! The fact that you deal with this health \"condition\" every month or so does not negate the genuine suckage that comes with it.

A party that hubby is perfectly capable of going to alone is a lousy thing to demand of someone who is miserable.\n\nThe severity of period cramps varies wildly, and most women who complain to their doctor about period issues get brushed off unless they\u2019re bleeding heavily enough to become anemic.  Many women don\u2019t realize that their symptoms are abnormal, even when they\u2019re severe, because our culture behaves like you are, poo-pooing the idea that women can suffer pretty badly on their periods.
