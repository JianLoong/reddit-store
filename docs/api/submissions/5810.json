We had no idea they were coming around, they had never mentioned it and we had told them that we were wanting our first Christmas as a family to be quiet and just the three of us. We were planning on just hanging around the house, wearing pjs, eating take out food, playing video games while son napped. As this was the plan, I had decided to do a heavy oiling on my hair and wrap it up in plastic wrap to keep the heat in. My partner is cool with me doing heavy oiling, usually I wear it to bed with my hair wrapped in plastic wrap and my bonnet on top, and he had encouraged that I did a heavily oil during the day on Christmas.\n\nIn the early afternoon, I went to the door and my in laws were there. MIL, FIL and BIL. They had decided that we had already had the morning to laze about and they had come around so son could open his presents. Son is 7 months old, he has no interest in presents and has no idea what is going on which is why we were having such a low key Christmas. They weren\u2019t impressed that we weren\u2019t dressed, but even less impressed that I had such oily hair. MIL took me aside in the kitchen and berated me for not taking pride in my appearance and for looking so slobby when I should have expected them to turn up. I told MIL that she should just be glad that we had clothes on as we could have been naked as we had told people we wanted a quiet Christmas. She was offended that I had dared to suggest we could have been naked, especially with son in the house. Partner thought it was funny that I had told her we could be naked and has suggested that next time when they turn up unannounced that we answer the door naked. My in laws weren\u2019t happy that we weren\u2019t dressed or expecting them.\n\nYesterday, we both received texts from MIL and BIL having a go for the state we were in, and for me having oily hair that was wrapped in plastic wrap as I looked ridiculous. MIL expressed her disdain at the naked comment. Partner messaged them back and told them that we are allowed to dress how we like in our own home and if I want to oil my hair then I can. He also told them that from now own, we are a nudist home and if they are going to be prudish about it then they can arrange a time where they would like to meet us outside of the home. MIL has been messaging me separately, telling me that I looked slobby and should be ashamed of myself as partner shouldn\u2019t have to see me in that state. While partner is really supportive of what I do to care for myself, it\u2019s got me wondering if this was an asshole move on my part.\n\nAITA for answering the door with my hair heavily oiled?", "created_utc": 1672189891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zww4bp/aita_for_answering_the_door_to_my_in_laws_with/", "score": 958, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There were two lady Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses on my porch, both wearing nice dresses and looking absolutely scandalized.\n\nIt turned out that when that robe got wet, the white stripes turned transparent (and the pink ones were pretty close, too), so they got a bit more of a look at me than any of us wanted. On the plus side (I guess?), they never visited that house again!", "Should throw  out husband  and baby of course  so the6 do not see such a horrible  sight/s. Nta  op. Just answer with a manners book in which is stated clearly that anyone  wanting  to visit  must call ahead  and ACCEPT whatever  answer  they  get from the persons  living  there.\nAlso let them all know that if they ever show up unannounced again (short of a real emergency)  you will not answer the door even if you are home.", "That bit is straight up crazy.", "He wasn't trying to force anything, and he at least still called and gave you a chance to say no before even getting out of bed.\n\nI'd say good parenting on boundaries. He will most likely not forget again and it's fine, right?\n\nAnd you can always remind him of it when you need an anecdote. The true benefit of children doing stupid shit.", "Also, it's a bit different because it's your own kid, he's seen you in all kinds of dress & undress (and vice versa).   He was still good enough to call--and it sounds like you could also have told him \"give us about a half hour and then come back, we'll be dressed and ready\" and he would have been fine with that!", "And it doesn't have to be on his lips either \ud83d\ude09", "at my house, unexpected guests are greeted by my St Bernard barking at the door. hes cute and cuddly but 150lb dogs sure do have an intimidating bark. People have stopped turning up unexpectedly ever since", "My house they're greeted by a grumpy introvert AND a fairly well-trained German Shepherd.\n\nBy well-trained, I tell them that she knows how to bite but is a little slow on the release.", "My dog is medium sized and doesn't understand that not every visitor wants to be his new best friend. We're both vary of visitors that expect me to dress properly or him to not kiss their hands", "Older people are sometimes less sensitive to heat due to age-related hormonal changes (thyroid and so on).", "I was wondering if someone would go there.\ud83e\udd23", "Still. Its a hot day I want it relax. Not come off as a 1950s salesman", "Is there anything that can be used other than those two?  I am allergic to jojoba oil (my neck & back get all itchy and burny feeling), and I suspect that I may also be allergic to argon.  I get the mildly itchy/burning neck like the first few times I used jojoba oil.", "So you then wash with normal shampoo afterwards?", "Sure, just saying this man might have not felt too hot in said suit. I actually worked with an older lady where we had constant \"thermostat war\" because she was always too cold while most of us were sweating.", "Try sweet almond oil to see if that works for you.", "I've heard olive and just plain vitamin e oils work really well. I tried the oiling regime as I heard it helps grow your hair **super** long, but my hair just looked really greasy and bad.", "Almond, Apricot kernel, Avocado, or Babasu are options."]}
