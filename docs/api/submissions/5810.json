We had no idea they were coming around, they had never mentioned it and we had told them that we were wanting our first Christmas as a family to be quiet and just the three of us. We were planning on just hanging around the house, wearing pjs, eating take out food, playing video games while son napped. As this was the plan, I had decided to do a heavy oiling on my hair and wrap it up in plastic wrap to keep the heat in. My partner is cool with me doing heavy oiling, usually I wear it to bed with my hair wrapped in plastic wrap and my bonnet on top, and he had encouraged that I did a heavily oil during the day on Christmas.\n\nIn the early afternoon, I went to the door and my in laws were there. MIL, FIL and BIL. They had decided that we had already had the morning to laze about and they had come around so son could open his presents. Son is 7 months old, he has no interest in presents and has no idea what is going on which is why we were having such a low key Christmas. They weren\u2019t impressed that we weren\u2019t dressed, but even less impressed that I had such oily hair. MIL took me aside in the kitchen and berated me for not taking pride in my appearance and for looking so slobby when I should have expected them to turn up. I told MIL that she should just be glad that we had clothes on as we could have been naked as we had told people we wanted a quiet Christmas. She was offended that I had dared to suggest we could have been naked, especially with son in the house. Partner thought it was funny that I had told her we could be naked and has suggested that next time when they turn up unannounced that we answer the door naked. My in laws weren\u2019t happy that we weren\u2019t dressed or expecting them.\n\nYesterday, we both received texts from MIL and BIL having a go for the state we were in, and for me having oily hair that was wrapped in plastic wrap as I looked ridiculous. MIL expressed her disdain at the naked comment. Partner messaged them back and told them that we are allowed to dress how we like in our own home and if I want to oil my hair then I can. He also told them that from now own, we are a nudist home and if they are going to be prudish about it then they can arrange a time where they would like to meet us outside of the home. MIL has been messaging me separately, telling me that I looked slobby and should be ashamed of myself as partner shouldn\u2019t have to see me in that state. While partner is really supportive of what I do to care for myself, it\u2019s got me wondering if this was an asshole move on my part.\n\nAITA for answering the door with my hair heavily oiled?\n\nEdit: My in laws aren't being racist towards me. They are white, as am I. I just have very dry, wavy hair thanks to my grandmother who had very curly hair that was much drier than mine, she could go 3 weeks without washing her hair if she wanted. We don't have a doorbell or a camera, but after this we have decided to get a ring doorbell. We will also be changing our locks as MIL has a spare key. My partner is loving the comments about him being supportive, he is the most supportive partner I could have. He's been helping me learn to place firm boundaries with my own family. Following a string of behaviour from BIL regards to things I do, I have decided to block him on everything, something my partner is fully supporting as BIL is clearly not understanding what we are saying when we express how we feel about anything. With MIL, we will be going low contact - FIL has apologised for everyone's behaviour as he thought we had invited them as MIL said they had to be at ours by a certain time.", "created_utc": 1672189891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zww4bp/aita_for_answering_the_door_to_my_in_laws_with/", "score": 3397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
