My case was severe and I lost all strength in and control of my arms and legs. My face, arms, torso below the waist, and legs all feel like I put them to sleep and there is almost no feeling in those areas. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks. I required an ambulance to get me out of bed and appointments for 3 months. \n\nI have very long hair (down to my butt). It\u2019s always been very important to me. It makes me feel like me (which is super important when I have lost everything else. I have lost all ability to do things I am passionate about). Laying in a hospital bed is havoc on the hair. I asked my wife (43F) to brush it several times but it never happened (she\u2019s done what I needed otherwise). It did  hurt a bit as she knew how I feel about my hair. I asked the care staff at the hospital but they were too busy. By the time I got home my hair was in a horribly tangled braid. Pre-illness I could have gotten it free in a few hours but I couldn\u2019t control my hands at all. At this point my wife made a half effort to untangle it but lacked the patience for it. She called a few stylists to see if someone could come to our house to work on it but no dice. Over the next 3 months lying in bed my hair transformed into a hard, matted baseball on top of my head. When I could get out a bit we tried a few local salons but they had no idea how to fix it. All suggested shaving it off. And that hurts my heart a lot. It would take 6 years to grow back.\n\nThis brings me to the issue: there is a salon 9 hours away that specializes in this issue. I have an appointment next week after an 8 week wait. The problem? They believe it will take 20 hours over 4 days to fix it. The appointments will cost $4000 and it\u2019s another $600 at least for gas, hotel, food, and expenses.  We are not rich in good times but my wife has had to quit working to be home to care for me. My medical supplies have increased spending (it takes forever to get Medicaid to cover supplies). That is a disgusting amount of money we could really use elsewhere. If i felt like this was my fault I wouldn\u2019t even consider spending that money. I feel like my wife could have prevented this all by just brushing my hair. Or having a measure of patience to detangle it when I got home. Also, she clearly hates working on my hair and I will need someone to brush it (possibly forever). She\u2019s the only option. I know being a caregiver is hard enough. I don\u2019t want to be more of a burden.  There is also the chance none of this works and I have to pay a lot of money and still lose it. I could live with a shaved head, no matter how hard it would be. Tomorrow morning is my last chance to cancel and get most of my deposits back. Would I be the asshole for spending all this money on my hair?", "created_utc": 1685459113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vsrbe/wibta_to_pay_5k_to_not_shave_my_head/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a huge pain in the ass, it took ages, but we did manage to salvage most of her hair just fine and I am most certainly not a trained professional, I just soaked it in a ton of good detangler and sat there unpicking hairs bit by bit with a crochet hook and a large sewing needle. May I suggest seeing if that's something you could pay a friend or someone with time to spare who could use some extra cash a more reasonable amount to take a go at? There is plenty of info online about how to DIY this, and there are plenty of people who would spend the time for a few hundred dollars vs a few thousand. You're probably still going to need to cut it shorter, there will be breakage, but you likely won't need to shave your head. Have you tried reaching out to friends for help with this? That's how I ended up helping my friend with hers, she asked friends for help and I happened to be off work on crutches for a week and said I'd give it a shot.", "I'm sorry this is happening to you.\n\nYTA\n\nI'm sorry, but your medical condition has made  caring for your hair a burden to your SO.   Since she no longer has a job, your $5k ask is too much.  Shave your head and stop being selfish.  You need to make more reasonable priorities.\n\nAlso, once you spend the $5k, what happens next?  Your SO will continue to not brush your hair and you can't do it yourself.  You'll be back to square 1 in 6 months?  12?\n\n>And that hurts my heart a lot.\n\nIt hurts my heart that I didn't get to go to Space Camp.", "Sorry but yes you would be TA, and I really sympathize about your situation. It must be very hard but think about how hard it is for your wife and she has stuck by you and even now I didn't read that she said no once when you made these appointments.\n\nI would cancel the appointment and get my head shaved. I'm a balding male who hasn't cut his hair since pre-covid. I don't claim to know what it's like for a female to lose their hair, I do think it would be tougher for you than it would be for me. But that's $4k you might really desperately have needed at some point, don't do the wrong thing. It's fiscal responsibility versus vanity.\n\nI know it sounds bad but you can get a wig in the beginning and within 3 years your hair won't have grown all the way back but it will be a suitable length again. I promise it'll be fine. You won't have to wait 6 years and this time it'll be a more manageable length that can be maintained by a salon.\n\nIt's going to be a tough pill to swallow OP but I think you should take the L and also make your wife feel appreciated. She sounds like she's ride or die for you. When you have somebody like that in your corner you can handle being bald.", "I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole but I want you to consider, what is going to prevent your hair from becoming matted a second time? And a third? Your wife doesn\u2019t have the ability to maintain it - please consider what else she does in a single day and then add another hour of hair maintenance daily. Can she realistically do that? She might promise today but caregiver burnout is real and your hair seems like a real point of resentment for both of you. $5k is nothing to sneeze at when you are both seemingly unemployed/on a limited income if you have some benefits.\n\nAnd when your hair is detangled, it will be damaged. A hair stylist will recommend cutting it any way, it will be nothing your hair pre-matting.", "NAH caregiving is hard enough without salon work involved. And you should be able to keep your hair... but you need to figure this expense out. Do you have friends or family who would chip in? Maybe an online fundraiser would help?", "NAH, this is beyond being a tough situation for both of you.  What about a compromise.  Cut your hair to like shoulder level and then work on detangling?", "Shave your head and be done. Your situation sucks big time, but you\u2019re not thinking about this logically.

And your wife gets to not become your personal stylist. I don't think YTA for wanting to resolve the problem in your favor. We all identify ourselves to ourselves with certain markers, after all. Your key sign post is your long hair.

So even if you get it \u201cfixed\u201d this time (five grand???Good grief!), will it happen again?\n\nFWIW, I had two friends who had extra long hair.

I also had long hair like that and I understand how it easely becomes some sort of personal trademark, but it's not healthy to let it define you, you are much more than that. I know now with everything you've been through, that it might seem as the last bit of your old self you think you can save, but you can look at your hair like memory, it grew with you and to some extent has physical remnants of everything you've lived through. But this last chapter of yours might be a sign to let it go now and start fresh. Better keep the money to make new and better memories for you and your wife. Really focus on recovery and be grateful for the people that are close to you now.

Having to give up something because of a physical illness is difficult, even more so when you realize it could be avoided if you could get other people to just do what you want them to do.

If, when you say, \"we could really use it elsewhere\" means that yes that amount would make life easier if put somewhere else (aka  maybe that could mean fixing a lose railing or allow more luxuries that were left behind once medical costs increased, etc etc). I'd say tell your wife that this is important to you, and say that you asked for  additional support to prevent this from happening as you were unable to do so, that you don't blame her for not being able to provide that support, but this is an incredibly important thing to you . \n\n However, if when you say you two could really use it elsewhere, in the sense that it means you are in crippling debt / at risk of losing car/income/support/home , then I'd say shave your head in pride , because sometimes we have to say no to things even if it hurts us , if it means to protect our family. \n\n\nAs much as I'd like to call your wife an asshole for not doing preventative maintenance on your hair , especially since you mentioned she lacked patience for it.

My heart goes out to you", "Considering how much it means to you, I'm shocked at your wife's unwillingness to help with your hair.

You've been dealt a serious blow to your health, you should be as happy with your looks as possible. But the situation being what it is...deep breaths and let go.", "I just don't understand why your wife couldn't brush your hair in the first place from the get go. It would have taken all of ten seconds. What an odd thing to refuse to do when you're caring for someone.", "NTA. Nobody in your life would brush your hair. It's their fault it got like that. And any money you spend will ne their fault as well. But I think it's important that you take the time to realize that if they wouldn't brudh it before, they aren't going to brush it after either. If you aren't capable of brushing it yourself it's just going to get tangled like that again. It would be a huge waste of money to detangle it knowing that nobody in your life will actually help keep it untangled.\nYour significant other is going to resent you spending the money. You obviously resent them not giving you the care you needed. I'm not suggesting a break up. Just decide for yourself if you can afford to make your partner's life harder just to feel better for a couple days until it starts tangling again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would cost a lot of money you don't have to even try to get it back to how it was. And even then, it would be a lot of headache to maintain for someone who's already doing a lot to help you. At the moment their guilt is getting in the way of their good financial sense, but it's pretty plain they don't like brushing your hair, and that guilt will turn to resentment over time.\n\nAs a tiny consolation, if you were to shave it off then you'd have short, new-grown hair, which would be ideal for bleaching and then dyeing bright colours. It could become a positive new look rather than an absence of what you used to have.", "Hi - I had GBS 10 years ago and believe me I get how hard it is when your body revolts against you. \nI will first say NTA - you feel like this is the only part of the real you that you have a (expensive) chance at getting back. \nOnly you and your wife know if the financial burden is too much. Are there any other compromises that are possible? I\u2019m envisioning the matting has happened bc your head is moving against your pillow so the knots are close to your scalp. Would the time/price be a little less if you were to cut off a significant amount prior to working on the top? \nAlso - if you don\u2019t already have silk pillowcases- get some.", "First and foremost, I am happy that you are recovering from GB. I hope that you recover fully.\n\nSecond, many of us gain self esteem and pleasure from our hair. Even though you are one of those people, you need to face reality. Hair is just hair. You wrote that it would take you 6 years to grow the hair back if you shave your head. If you shave your head, you might find that your ego does not exist in your hair. Your ego is in your life, which includes your wife.\n\nI can't tell you how to spend your money, but $5k vs a shaved head? I'd go for the shaved head. \n\nNot that my opinion matters, but if you wasted the money on your hair, YWBTA.", "Soft YTA your wife is likely exhausted from running round and brushing your long hair is not on her priority list. 5k fpr a hair appointment shouldn't be either when you have medical bills and a wife who has given up work to care for you I couldn't justify it no matter the reason why it hot that way", "Info - Is there a compromise? Could you have it cut shorter and then spend less on having shorter hair detangled?", "Take this from someone who spent 2 months in the hospital mostly immobilized and with very limited use of their hands: YWBTA. Recovery is tumultuous at best and spending this much money on hair is not a wise decision. I had waist length hair when I was admitted, hair I refused to cut for damn near a decade beforehand. 4 months after being in the hospital and it was falling out in baseball sized clumps due to stress and my body just trying to manage other aspects of my illness. I absolutely understand that your hair is important to you, but this is money you do not have to spend, especially when you don\u2019t have a reliable source of income, and no guarantee that detangling will even preserve your hair long term.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to spend that kind of money given your current situation. Could another local hair shop cut it and make it manageable for cheaper? Doesn\u2019t seem like you should detangle it and ask your wife to add it to the things she has to maintain.", "Gentle yta. You are not a burden but now you are adding on a burden. Financially for sure, but also, going forward. Your wife may not have the patience you hoped for, but she is likely struggling with all this too. While your hair means a lot to you, but it also affects your wifes mental health having extra work. Will the same thing just keep in happening? You spend all this money and end up in the same position.\n\nMaybe it's time to consider finding new things that make you happy that you can do. It must be incredibly difficult right now, and I'd be feeling more than sorry for myself too, but you need a practical care plan going forward. And you need to think how it will put strain on your relationship spending this money. Let go of the resentment you feel towards your wife. She likely was doing all she could with the energy she has.", "YTA I have worked with matted hair. You can definitely cut it shorter and super slowly work out the mat. It takes for freaking ever but it would be easier than hip length hair. I am sorry for the situation you are in. \n\nI just had a surgery and seeing my hair in a horrible state plus all the pain I was in made me feel like my body wasn't my own. It's just one more thing happening that you have no control of. It sucks that there wasn't more help offered. It sounds like you haven't forgiven your wife. Please start there first, I'm sure she was/is trying and was overwhelmed.", "Ywbta man, I really hate to call you an ahole bc this situation straight up sucks for everyone all around. But bottom line is you don't have the money.  I would not do it.", "You keep saying your wife will take care of it moving forward and it\u2019s only 10 mins a day for you. \n\nFor her? It\u2019s an extra task that realistically may not be 10 mins anymore because you cannot help her. Also you\u2019ve lived with the hair which means you have a routine that makes it quick so your time estimate is really really off and personal to you. \n\nI guess a way to look at it is - she\u2019s now caring for herself, for you, for your home. Why force her to take on a task that she doesn\u2019t need to? I understand she feels bad but is that because you made her feel bad by blowing up on her and making it seem like it\u2019s her fault it got that bad and now you can\u2019t do anything about it? Or did she feel bad on her own without you saying a word to her? \n\nYWBTA if you spent the money you know y\u2019all don\u2019t have on something that is going to add another mental task onto her growing plate. I know it means a lot to you, I\u2019ve had super long hair and everything but my hair wasn\u2019t worth the stress it would put on others to maintain for me on top of everything else.", "First off, I\u2019m really sorry that this has happened to you, medical trauma is very difficult. I think 5k for hair is insane, but if it saves your mental health then it might be worth it in the long haul, but only you can determine if your mental health would suffer greatly.", "Mainly because I suspect your wife may not have put much effort into calling around. I feel like you could have even made a post on your local community groups asking if anyone would be up to the task and you'd likely have at least a few volunteers. You'd be amazed just how much those communities love coming together to help each other. This makes me feel that an important aspect of your care was neglected. Something that could have easily been avoided and my heart goes out to you for everything you've been through including facing the prospect of losing one of the last remaining aspects of your identity you hold dear.  \n\n\nI also feel greatly for your wife. Because this is not just life changing for you but also for her too! The level of change she's gone through is grand as well. Her entire life has been turned on it's side and all she's know, her future etc changed in a matter of moments and she's doing the best she can. It is a LOT of work to care for someone in your situation and I'd hope you'd be appreciative that she is holding true to her vows to you and continuing to care for you in this extremely stressful and trying time. She clearly loves you very much but she is also clearly not capable of taking on every aspect of your care. Your wife is NOT the only option and to place her in that position is not only unfair it's unrealistic.   \n\n\nHowever - you're now in this situation and are faced with 2 options. 1 reasonable, and 1 completely unreasonable and unacceptable. Frankly... The best option for yourself, your marriage,  both your lives together and your wife is for you to accept that your hair has to go.   \n\n\nBecause you can't keep this up \"Forever\". Soft YTA", "I'm sorry this situation just sucks in every way but YTA if you're thinking of spending money you don't have. What happens after the appointment?

It\u2019s sucks but seems to be the harsh reality that OP is currently in.", "My wife feels awful that this happened and she says she will help me with it from now on.", "Great comment, sums up my feelings well. \n\nYou're having such a tough time and I am sorry this is your experience right now. But you need to give your wife some leeway here too, take it from me, the transition from equal partners to caring for you SO is huge both physically and mentally.\n\nI'm sure your hair is really something you love and have taken great pains to care for over your life.  Unfortunately being ill means we have to also make some compromises and changes.  I hope you have lots of good days going forward.", "Managing my dad was a full time job when he was sick. And he was bald.", "I do realize that caregiving is stressful. Being chronically ill is stupid stressful too. And caregiving does include hygiene items such as brushing hair and teeth and bathing.

She says she just thought it wasn\u2019t serious and had no idea hair could mat up like this.", "No, it\u2019s so matted up it would just come off in a massive felted ball.", "No, it\u2019s either a no guard shave or detangle it all. If anything approaching middle ground were possible I would have just went with that.", "Unfortunately no one in my family or friend group can (or will) do it. It\u2019s maddening as I could do it myself so easily if but my hands would listen.", "Well general hair brushing took me less than 10 minutes a day. I wash it every 7-10 days and air dry it. My wife feels awful this happened and says she will help with maintenance from now on. The salon I am going to generally does have good results with not too much damage.", "Hygiene is part of caregiving too. I have asked around to family and friends but I\u2019m not sure how much they can help out.", "I would gladly do that. However, the way it is mattered means either a no guard shave or completely untangling it.", "I am not at all punishing my wife. She feels awful this has happened. I\u2019ve never blamed her or made her feel bad about it. She supports me getting it fixed and said she will help me from now on.", "No, I\u2019ve not made up my mind. I\u2019ve just been answering the questions asked. And I really do have empathy for my wife and I appreciate everything she does for me. I let her know this regularly. I also go out of my way to do anything I can or to avoid bothering her in the first place. I\u2019ve also never blamed her or guilted her about my hair. There is a post length limit though so I wasn\u2019t able to include a lot of that.", "Yeah, most people recover in 6-12 months. But I am 6 months out and no improvement at all. Cutting it I could deal with but only fully detangling it or completely shaving it are options. I don\u2019t have headaches or neck/back issues . My wife does feel horrible that this has happened and has said she\u2019ll help me with it from now on.", "We\u2019ve tried a lot of local places and only two would even look at it. One said nothing could be done. Another offered to do it for far less but tapped out after her hand hurt after the appointment.", "I was a little taken aback too. She actually loves my hair. She has rather long hair herself. She just had no idea it would end up like this. No idea what she thought would happen. She feels awful and does support getting it fixed and says she\u2019ll help from now on.", "It depends on how much care she was doing. If she wasn\u2019t doing a lot, sure maybe she is a bit AH to not brush it. But what if she\u2019s been doing nearly everything? Cooking, cleaning, feeding even, bathing, dressing, toileting, brushing teeth? When you become a carer on that level, you focus on the necessities. Brushing hair too probably was easily forgotten about compared to everything else, in which case I wouldn\u2019t be so hard on a woman who has to devote herself to full time care. But the post is vague on exactly what she does, so I can\u2019t say for sure.", "That\u2019s kinda what I thought. She was at the hospital for less than an hour per day (it\u2019s not far from our house). And she generally does a good job taking care of me and I do appreciate it. But by the same token she probably does caregiving a couple of hours a day and works far fewer hours than when she had a job. But I\u2019ll need to think that over again since most people seem to think that expectation was asshole-ish.", "At this point my wife feels really horrible about the whole thing. She had no clue this could happen. She does totally support spending the money and promises to help from now on.", "I haven\u2019t checked with the beauty schools but none of the other salons around are willing.

Usually my hair isn\u2019t difficult or time consuming to maintain. So it is another thing on the pile but it isn\u2019t a big one. I don\u2019t resent her. I\u2019m just disappointed. I\u2019m trying to find new things to get into but I have no hand strength or dexterity. So most things don\u2019t work.", "My hair is matted to my scalp in a big ball.

Having it around and matted for so long has made it harder to move on.", "If you have straight white girl hair it should be doable. A friend of mine had dreads (I know) and didn\u2019t want to shave. It took some effort but we saved most of her hair and it was shoulder length at the end", "Are you willing to cut your hair to a FAR more manageable length - likely far shorter than you\u2019re happy with - if she lets you go through with this (absolutely bonkers) expense?", "That is not the same as her liking taking care of your hair. Also, you say it's 10 mins for you. But you now need a full time carer. What is needed to prepare to do your hair and then reset? Presumably you might need to be moved from an easy chair or bed to a stool etc?", "Hair brushing is one thing. Hair brushing waist length hair is a completely different task. That's seriously exhausting arm work for anyone, especially someone who is already exhausted and caring for every other aspect of your lives. I feel so sad for everyone in this situation and I'm so sorry you're all struggling but spending money you don't have to possibly save something cosmetic that you would expect your wife to continue to care for isn't ok. You WBTA to spend that money and assign her a serious chore she doesn't want to do, and in the end, isn't medically necessary. Maybe put some of that money into family therapy to help everyone deal better.", "Honestly, I think the effort to detangle your hair combined with what already happened may leave it extremely damaged. Even if they can get it detangled, you are likely to lose a lot of it and what is left would be very damaged. I\u2019d suggest that you seriously consider cutting off most of it, cancel this appointment. You really cannot afford it. And don\u2019t blame your wife, it\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s another horrible outcome of your illness.", "I find it weird that they're not willing to chop the knot in half and go from there. Yta if you spend that much money though.", "You can cut it to bob length on your own and then it won\u2019t take 20 hours to detangle.  Hair that is 8 inches long will detangle significantly faster than hair that is 3 feet long.  You may even be able to find someone locally who can do it.", "Is there a high-school with a hairstyling program nearby? You might be able to find someone willing to take a go at it on their own time for a much more reasonable price there. \n\nI'm so sorry everyone has left you in this situation. It's one thing to not be willing to take care of someone's waistlength hair and discuss needing to cut it shorter, but to leave it completely unattended to this point is well over the line into medical neglect. I'm not sure what's going on with your partner or why she flat out refused to help with basic grooming but that's pretty awful.\n\nEdit to add: not sure where you are, but if you're in central Canada send me a message because if you're near me I'd be happy to try and help.", "Honestly, you keep saying that, but it doesn't make the fact that you can't afford it any less true. $5k is too much money to ask. I know you love your hair and shaving it feels like giving up too much but the hair will come back, $5k with no incoming money is too much to ask your wife to sacrifice on top of all the care she does for you now and yes, hygiene is a part of care and yes that means hair but unfortunately this is a lose lose situation. You need to let go.", "Hygiene, yes. But super long hair can take hours of care every week, on top of the hygiene work she may have to do to bathe you, brush your teeth, do basic skincare, etc. It would be nice if you could keep your hair.

Honestly reading your post I was thinking NAH but the more I read your comments, the more I think YTA. Your wife is a person. Your hair are not even if they're a precious part of you. Your mind seems already set, I don't understand why you are asking for everyone's opinion.", "Honestly, I think you\u2019re being super unfair to your wife. You\u2019re blaming a hell of a lot on her, without realizing she is literally responsible for every little thing.  She should have gotten you to cut it at the onset so it was easily manageable, but you could have offered that as well. You could have tried to find a solution at any point before it got to a huge mat. I feel for you, this illness is awful and terrible to watch.

Just try not to throw it in her face if you get mad in the future.", "I do have that hair type. The issue is that my hair isn\u2019t hanging down at all.

I have never blamed her or guilted her about what has happened.", "You know your hair best so you could have your care down but I've had hair down my back and it would tire me sometimes to wash, condition, brush and dry or style it. I also have a very easy medium thickness hair with no curls (think straight white girl hair if you will, lol)  so I can't imagine how tiring just brushing such super long hair would be for someone not used to it. Just because it's easy for you to manage, doesn't make it easy for her. Plus she agreed now but is it really fair to expect her to continue this? I'm not familiar with your disease but is it long term? How long would you expect her to keep this up? In the end, you don't have the money though. There really shouldn't be anything beyond that. Everything else debated is just details.

It takes me a good 20 mins to power brush through my hair when I\u2019ve just washed it with conditioner. And I can move around to adapt to the brushing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have felt like you have lost everything and now your hair might be going too. But the personal hygiene is a lot on top of your high maintenance hair for a caregiver. $5000 is too much money when you can\u2019t afford it. Then if you do it, wife will be on the hook to handle your hair even if it\u2019s too much because she feels guilty. Otherwise, you shave it and she feels guilty because she didn\u2019t brush your hair.

Doesn't matter if it was 10 minutes total (I'm really struggling to believe the 10 minutes but hey, your hair) or the 10 minutes however many times a week over the next possible year (seriously did you do the math on how many hours you are asking her to do this unwanted chore if it lasts a year? She's already doing everything else). \n\nAnd again, you do not have the money. You cannot pay for this. Do not do something you cannot pay for. Spending this money, which you do not have, would be a very bad idea."]}
