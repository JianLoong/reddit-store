My case was severe and I lost all strength in and control of my arms and legs. My face, arms, torso below the waist, and legs all feel like I put them to sleep and there is almost no feeling in those areas. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks. I required an ambulance to get me out of bed and appointments for 3 months. \n\nI have very long hair (down to my butt). It\u2019s always been very important to me. It makes me feel like me (which is super important when I have lost everything else. I have lost all ability to do things I am passionate about). Laying in a hospital bed is havoc on the hair. I asked my wife (43F) to brush it several times but it never happened (she\u2019s done what I needed otherwise). It did  hurt a bit as she knew how I feel about my hair. I asked the care staff at the hospital but they were too busy. By the time I got home my hair was in a horribly tangled braid. Pre-illness I could have gotten it free in a few hours but I couldn\u2019t control my hands at all. At this point my wife made a half effort to untangle it but lacked the patience for it. She called a few stylists to see if someone could come to our house to work on it but no dice. Over the next 3 months lying in bed my hair transformed into a hard, matted baseball on top of my head. When I could get out a bit we tried a few local salons but they had no idea how to fix it. All suggested shaving it off. And that hurts my heart a lot. It would take 6 years to grow back.\n\nThis brings me to the issue: there is a salon 9 hours away that specializes in this issue. I have an appointment next week after an 8 week wait. The problem? They believe it will take 20 hours over 4 days to fix it. The appointments will cost $4000 and it\u2019s another $600 at least for gas, hotel, food, and expenses.  We are not rich in good times but my wife has had to quit working to be home to care for me. My medical supplies have increased spending (it takes forever to get Medicaid to cover supplies). That is a disgusting amount of money we could really use elsewhere. If i felt like this was my fault I wouldn\u2019t even consider spending that money. I feel like my wife could have prevented this all by just brushing my hair. Or having a measure of patience to detangle it when I got home. Also, she clearly hates working on my hair and I will need someone to brush it (possibly forever). She\u2019s the only option. I know being a caregiver is hard enough. I don\u2019t want to be more of a burden.  There is also the chance none of this works and I have to pay a lot of money and still lose it. I could live with a shaved head, no matter how hard it would be. Tomorrow morning is my last chance to cancel and get most of my deposits back. Would I be the asshole for spending all this money on my hair?", "created_utc": 1685459113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vsrbe/wibta_to_pay_5k_to_not_shave_my_head/", "score": 4464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a huge pain in the ass, it took ages, but we did manage to salvage most of her hair just fine and I am most certainly not a trained professional, I just soaked it in a ton of good detangler and sat there unpicking hairs bit by bit with a crochet hook and a large sewing needle. May I suggest seeing if that's something you could pay a friend or someone with time to spare who could use some extra cash a more reasonable amount to take a go at? There is plenty of info online about how to DIY this, and there are plenty of people who would spend the time for a few hundred dollars vs a few thousand. You're probably still going to need to cut it shorter, there will be breakage, but you likely won't need to shave your head. Have you tried reaching out to friends for help with this? That's how I ended up helping my friend with hers, she asked friends for help and I happened to be off work on crutches for a week and said I'd give it a shot.", "I'm sorry this is happening to you.\n\nYTA\n\nI'm sorry, but your medical condition has made  caring for your hair a burden to your SO.   Since she no longer has a job, your $5k ask is too much.  Shave your head and stop being selfish.  You need to make more reasonable priorities.\n\nAlso, once you spend the $5k, what happens next?  Your SO will continue to not brush your hair and you can't do it yourself.  You'll be back to square 1 in 6 months?  12?\n\n>And that hurts my heart a lot.\n\nIt hurts my heart that I didn't get to go to Space Camp.", "Sorry but yes you would be TA, and I really sympathize about your situation. It must be very hard but think about how hard it is for your wife and she has stuck by you and even now I didn't read that she said no once when you made these appointments.\n\nI would cancel the appointment and get my head shaved. I'm a balding male who hasn't cut his hair since pre-covid. I don't claim to know what it's like for a female to lose their hair, I do think it would be tougher for you than it would be for me. But that's $4k you might really desperately have needed at some point, don't do the wrong thing. It's fiscal responsibility versus vanity.\n\nI know it sounds bad but you can get a wig in the beginning and within 3 years your hair won't have grown all the way back but it will be a suitable length again. I promise it'll be fine. You won't have to wait 6 years and this time it'll be a more manageable length that can be maintained by a salon.\n\nIt's going to be a tough pill to swallow OP but I think you should take the L and also make your wife feel appreciated. She sounds like she's ride or die for you. When you have somebody like that in your corner you can handle being bald.", "I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole but I want you to consider, what is going to prevent your hair from becoming matted a second time? And a third? Your wife doesn\u2019t have the ability to maintain it - please consider what else she does in a single day and then add another hour of hair maintenance daily. Can she realistically do that? She might promise today but caregiver burnout is real and your hair seems like a real point of resentment for both of you. $5k is nothing to sneeze at when you are both seemingly unemployed/on a limited income if you have some benefits.\n\nAnd when your hair is detangled, it will be damaged. A hair stylist will recommend cutting it any way, it will be nothing your hair pre-matting.", "NAH caregiving is hard enough without salon work involved. And you should be able to keep your hair... but you need to figure this expense out. Do you have friends or family who would chip in? Maybe an online fundraiser would help?", "NAH, this is beyond being a tough situation for both of you.  What about a compromise.  Cut your hair to like shoulder level and then work on detangling?", "Shave your head and be done. Your situation sucks big time, but you\u2019re not thinking about this logically.

That's where the $5k should go, if you have a choice. Or for a part time in home help for your wife. Not your hair. Hair grows back. Hair is a luxury. Cancel this appointment if you care about getting better and spend the money on help for your wife and your therapy.", "Reading your comments it\u2019s sounds like you\u2019ve already made up your mind and you\u2019re just looking for validation.

So even if you get it \u201cfixed\u201d this time (five grand???Good grief!), will it happen again?\n\nFWIW, I had two friends who had extra long hair.

I know now with everything you've been through, that it might seem as the last bit of your old self you think you can save, but you can look at your hair like memory, it grew with you and to some extent has physical remnants of everything you've lived through. But this last chapter of yours might be a sign to let it go now and start fresh. Better keep the money to make new and better memories for you and your wife. Really focus on recovery and be grateful for the people that are close to you now.

Let it go and start new.", "I can't make a judgment on this one.  \n\nI am sorry you are dealing with this struggle.  Having to give up something because of a physical illness is difficult, even more so when you realize it could be avoided if you could get other people to just do what you want them to do.

If, when you say, \"we could really use it elsewhere\" means that yes that amount would make life easier if put somewhere else (aka  maybe that could mean fixing a lose railing or allow more luxuries that were left behind once medical costs increased, etc etc). I'd say tell your wife that this is important to you, and say that you asked for  additional support to prevent this from happening as you were unable to do so, that you don't blame her for not being able to provide that support, but this is an incredibly important thing to you . \n\n However, if when you say you two could really use it elsewhere, in the sense that it means you are in crippling debt / at risk of losing car/income/support/home , then I'd say shave your head in pride , because sometimes we have to say no to things even if it hurts us , if it means to protect our family. \n\n\nAs much as I'd like to call your wife an asshole for not doing preventative maintenance on your hair , especially since you mentioned she lacked patience for it.

Nobody in your life would brush your hair. It's their fault it got like that. And any money you spend will ne their fault as well. But I think it's important that you take the time to realize that if they wouldn't brudh it before, they aren't going to brush it after either. If you aren't capable of brushing it yourself it's just going to get tangled like that again. It would be a huge waste of money to detangle it knowing that nobody in your life will actually help keep it untangled.\nYour significant other is going to resent you spending the money. You obviously resent them not giving you the care you needed. I'm not suggesting a break up.

I would be similarly devastated to lose it and similarly angry about the short period of neglect taking it to its current state.\n\nBut it's past the point of no return. It would cost a lot of money you don't have to even try to get it back to how it was. And even then, it would be a lot of headache to maintain for someone who's already doing a lot to help you. At the moment their guilt is getting in the way of their good financial sense, but it's pretty plain they don't like brushing your hair, and that guilt will turn to resentment over time.\n\nAs a tiny consolation, if you were to shave it off then you'd have short, new-grown hair, which would be ideal for bleaching and then dyeing bright colours. It could become a positive new look rather than an absence of what you used to have.", "Hi - I had GBS 10 years ago and believe me I get how hard it is when your body revolts against you. \nI will first say NTA - you feel like this is the only part of the real you that you have a (expensive) chance at getting back. \nOnly you and your wife know if the financial burden is too much. Are there any other compromises that are possible? I\u2019m envisioning the matting has happened bc your head is moving against your pillow so the knots are close to your scalp. Would the time/price be a little less if you were to cut off a significant amount prior to working on the top? \nAlso - if you don\u2019t already have silk pillowcases- get some.", "First and foremost, I am happy that you are recovering from GB. I hope that you recover fully.\n\nSecond, many of us gain self esteem and pleasure from our hair. Even though you are one of those people, you need to face reality. Hair is just hair.

Your ego is in your life, which includes your wife.\n\nI can't tell you how to spend your money, but $5k vs a shaved head? I'd go for the shaved head. \n\nNot that my opinion matters, but if you wasted the money on your hair, YWBTA.", "Soft YTA your wife is likely exhausted from running round and brushing your long hair is not on her priority list. 5k fpr a hair appointment shouldn't be either when you have medical bills and a wife who has given up work to care for you I couldn't justify it no matter the reason why it hot that way", "Info - Is there a compromise? Could you have it cut shorter and then spend less on having shorter hair detangled?", "Take this from someone who spent 2 months in the hospital mostly immobilized and with very limited use of their hands: YWBTA.

I had waist length hair when I was admitted, hair I refused to cut for damn near a decade beforehand. 4 months after being in the hospital and it was falling out in baseball sized clumps due to stress and my body just trying to manage other aspects of my illness. I absolutely understand that your hair is important to you, but this is money you do not have to spend, especially when you don\u2019t have a reliable source of income, and no guarantee that detangling will even preserve your hair long term.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to spend that kind of money given your current situation.

It\u2019s an extra task that realistically may not be 10 mins anymore because you cannot help her. Also you\u2019ve lived with the hair which means you have a routine that makes it quick so your time estimate is really really off and personal to you. \n\nI guess a way to look at it is - she\u2019s now caring for herself, for you, for your home. Why force her to take on a task that she doesn\u2019t need to? I understand she feels bad but is that because you made her feel bad by blowing up on her and making it seem like it\u2019s her fault it got that bad and now you can\u2019t do anything about it?

I think 5k for hair is insane, but if it saves your mental health then it might be worth it in the long haul, but only you can determine if your mental health would suffer greatly.", "Mainly because I suspect your wife may not have put much effort into calling around. I feel like you could have even made a post on your local community groups asking if anyone would be up to the task and you'd likely have at least a few volunteers. You'd be amazed just how much those communities love coming together to help each other. This makes me feel that an important aspect of your care was neglected. Something that could have easily been avoided and my heart goes out to you for everything you've been through including facing the prospect of losing one of the last remaining aspects of your identity you hold dear.\n\nI also feel greatly for your wife. Because this is not just life changing for you but also for her too! The level of change she's gone through is grand as well. Her entire life has been turned on it's side and all she's know, her future etc changed in a matter of moments and she's doing the best she can. It is a LOT of work to care for someone in your situation and I'd hope you'd be appreciative that she is holding true to her vows to you and continuing to care for you in this extremely stressful and trying time. She clearly loves you very much but she is also clearly not capable of taking on every aspect of your care. Your wife is NOT the only option and to place her in that position is not only unfair it's unrealistic.\n\nHowever - you're now in this situation and are faced with 2 options. 1 reasonable, and 1 completely unreasonable and unacceptable. Frankly... The best option for yourself, your marriage,  both your lives together and your wife is for you to accept that your hair has to go.\n\nBecause you can't keep this up \"Forever\". ~~Soft YTA~~   \n\n\n\\*Edit: Have to vote HARD YTA after reading your comments and replies.

One said nothing could be done. Another offered to do it for far less but tapped out after her hand hurt after the appointment.", "I was a little taken aback too. She actually loves my hair. She has rather long hair herself. She just had no idea it would end up like this. No idea what she thought would happen. She feels awful and does support getting it fixed and says she\u2019ll help from now on.", "It depends on how much care she was doing. If she wasn\u2019t doing a lot, sure maybe she is a bit AH to not brush it. But what if she\u2019s been doing nearly everything? Cooking, cleaning, feeding even, bathing, dressing, toileting, brushing teeth? When you become a carer on that level, you focus on the necessities. Brushing hair too probably was easily forgotten about compared to everything else, in which case I wouldn\u2019t be so hard on a woman who has to devote herself to full time care. But the post is vague on exactly what she does, so I can\u2019t say for sure.", "That\u2019s kinda what I thought. She was at the hospital for less than an hour per day (it\u2019s not far from our house). And she generally does a good job taking care of me and I do appreciate it.

It's one thing to not be willing to take care of someone's waistlength hair and discuss needing to cut it shorter, but to leave it completely unattended to this point is well over the line into medical neglect.

You need to let go.", "Hygiene, yes. But super long hair can take hours of care every week, on top of the hygiene work she may have to do to bathe you, brush your teeth, do basic skincare, etc. It would be nice if you could keep your hair.

Start fresh. It might surprise you how light it feels. I shaved mine in lockdown and actually it grew back in so much better than before I shaved it, and detangling will not leave it looking as it did before so you might be left with a 5k bill for having to chop it all off anyway. But then, instead of spending 5k, be generous with a budget for a beautiful wig (or even a couple). A lady I see doing the school runs, I happened to notice one day that her hair was buzzcut short and I was shocked because she had such beautiful hair the day before. Next day, the hair was back. Turns out, been wigs all along. She changes her style a lot but they all look incredibly natural. My nana also wears one, though I always forget.

Im sick of the burden. im coming up on almost a year post diagnosis and ill just say until you get your strength back this will continue to be an issue. You should be using that money for recovery.

I was almost at the point of shaving it all off, because it's all I could think to do. \n\nBefore spending $5K that you can't afford, have you tried Johnson's No More Tangles spray? If you can find someone to work on your hair with that spray, you might be able to get the mat untangled. \n\nMy thin, fine, mid-back hair took probably three hours, but I had to take multiple breaks, because I was so weak. You obviously can't do this yourself, but someone standing behind you, working on your hair, might be a lot quicker. I found that, once I got the untangling started, it went pretty fast. It took almost as long to find an area of mattage that would start to untangle as it did to finish the process once the matting started to give way. \n\nYou're not TA for wanting to hold on to a part of you that means so much to your identity, especially when you've lost so much.

Referring to brushing hair and specialized hair care?!\n\nSure, wife might be exhausted but refusing to spend 45 seconds brushing her wife's hair to prevent it to getting to this state wouldn't have killed her. That's neglect and down right disgusting. A tired parent who allows their child's hair to matt gets in trouble, why's it different for a wife.\n\nHer wife getting an extra 45 seconds was more important than OPs self esteem and care?\n\nESH, mostly the wife but OP bc you two cannot afford this right now.", "YTA. Cut your hair, that's insane.", "I have a chronic, permanent illness that I've been dealing with for over a decade where in which I have plenty of days where simply moving is just not an option. I used (key word here is \"used\") to have long, wavy, gorgeous hair. I loved my hair, but it took an enormous amount of time and effort to keep in shape when I was well.\n\nIn the early days of my illness I had a flare that lasted over a week that kept me bed-bound. I was unable to do anything to care for myself, let alone take care of my hair. My hair was a total mess by the end of that flare. This illness was already such a burden on myself as well as my then-husband at the time. He honestly took my illness way worse than I did (lead to depression, excessive drinking, neglect, etc.). At the time I didn't have the heart to put anymore burden on him than I already was. I decided to cut my hair from below my chest length to pixie short just so that there'd be one less thing to worry about. I cared about him at the time, so I wanted to ease the burden as much as possible.\n\nLosing something you love about yourself really does hurt. But sometimes letting go of that for someone you love is necessary just for the ease of life both of you need. I'm gonna go with NTA (as I've been in a similar situation), but there are times when you need to prioritize your needs over your wants. You and your wife aren't working, you have a kid to take care of, and don't forget your severe health issue. Spending $5k to keep something that will grow back over time (we all know haircuts aren't permanent) over prioritizing your health (like PT, which is very needed for your issue), your wife (she's about to have surgery herself?!?!), or even your kid and general household (food/housing/gas/etc. ain't cheap) is prioritizing a want over a need. If I ever wanted my long hair back, I'd be ok with waiting for it to grow back (even if it took several months - a couple of years). I know that it's taken a burden off of mine and my now partner's life. I do not regret making that decision because I care about my partner. Plus, having one less thing to worry about (I still have my hair really short after all of these years) let's me focus on more important things in my life. Once you're in a position where you can take care of yourself without any issues, then you can revisit growing your hair back to the length you want.\n\nI know we as sick peeps need some sunshine in our lives, but it can be achieved in other ways (a favorite meal more often, watching a favorite show as often as you want, a small gift here and there, etc.). We can be a bit selfish without causing harm to others, whether that harm is physical, emotional, monetary, etc. Keeping your hair would probably be too much for your current situation, and for the others that you care for in your life. The more we say \"If I/we did 'this' differently...\" the less we get to enjoy what little there is to enjoy in life. Don't focus on the \"what ifs\" of the past, focus on the \"what ifs\" of the future.\nAs a side note, if you can see a therapist to help you with your emotional journey through this issue via Medicaid/Medicare, then I'd jump on it. Therapy has helped me a lot in putting things into perspective, but it can be pricey.\n\nEdit: I saw how you said that you've \"done this for your wife in the past\", but was it for the same amount of time? Was the hair length/texture comparable? If not then I don't think it's a good comparison. This leads me to ask if you both know your \"love languages\"? You taking care of her hair during that time may not mean the same thing to her as it did to you. You both might not show love in the same way. Despite that, knowing and appreciatiating the ways you both show your love is very important for a healthy relationship. This is so that one, the other, or both of you don't feel neglected/annoyed/disappointed/angry just because you're expecting her to show you love the way you'd like to be loved, but instead shows you her form of love, and vice versa (hope that made sense). You guys learning each other's love languages, then practicing loving each other in the ways that the other enjoys being loved is a great tool to have in maintaining a good, healthy relationship.", "Just get a haircut and grow it out later.

The matting and tangles can cause rashes and infections.\n\nThis is a safety issue, and while I get that it's probably very emotional for you, its incredibly selfish to put your aesthetic preferences over your own safety and financial stability, and make your wife's already incredibly difficult job of caring for you harder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: TLDR: For safety reasons you absolutely should not have waist-length hair regardless of whether you can maintain it or not.", "YTA.

It will not be the healthy, long, shiny hair that you identified with... that hair is already lost.  You will be paying $5k to resurrect a ghost of that hair and you will still experience the same painful sense of loss when you see it as you would with having it shaved (if less intense).\n\nYou will likely also end up with it matted again... it will be more prone to matting and you aren't able to keep it brushed and cared for at this time. \n\nI understand that shaving it off feels as if you are losing the last normal thing you have left and you would do almost anything to avoid that.  It's 100% OK to be absolutely devastated about losing your hair on top of everything else you lost.  It's OK to grieve, but I think it's important that you recognize paying for the detangling will only delay that grief, in the same way that considering getting it detangled has delayed it. \n\nThe hair you had before is gone.  I'm sorry.  Time to let it go and allow yourself to grieve it.  By shaving it off, you start with a fresh slate, growing hair that wasn't weakened by your illness and broken by detangling.  \n\nIt's important that you focus your finances on parts of your life that are more important and that can make a difference. Things that will help life feel more manageable for everyone in your family.  Physical therapy would be my first recommendation.  If you cannot afford it, just have one or two sessioms and ask for exercises you can do at home with your wife (or alone).   \n\nI cannot express enough how important physical therapy is.  I know it feels like it's not helping, but the changes are incremental... you're retaining your brain and nerves on how to talk to your muscles... that takes time and it will often be so gradual you don't notice the difference it's made for some time.\n\nIf you can, please try to forgive your wife for not being able to take on responsibility for your hair while she dealt with everything else she handled so well.

After months of being sick in bed and my mental health hitting an all time low ( my sons dad cheated and left for the woman he cheated with and my absolute best friend in the world died all within a year) my long hair was beyond being fixed. It was bad. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to shave my head. I literally wore hats even in the hot ass summer for 2 years because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. My hair was a huge part of my identity. Everyone close to me kept telling me to shave it and get it over with, that it would grow out by the winter. It really hurt my feelings. I knew it needed done but it was such a sensitive subject for me. I literally had dreams that I was able to get it untangled and I was so happy in my dreams. Last month I decided to bite the bullet. It was starting to get hot and I was tired of avoiding it. I had to use trimmers but didn\u2019t have to shave it to the scalp. Scissors wouldn\u2019t cut through the mat. I was able to salvage like 5 inches because it was in a bun when it got tangled. Thank god. But it is all different lengths because it was so matted I had to cut out chunks in different sections. I\u2019m so glad I did it. It felt so good to run my hand through my hair again, to scrub my scalp etc. and it\u2019s already grown some. I take 2 different supplements to help with growth and use a serum. I\u2019ve invested hundreds of dollars on the supplements but it\u2019s worth it to me. Had I cut it 2 years ago it\u2019d already be grown out. I\u2019m so mad at myself for procrastinating. So I completely understand. As silly as it sounds it was almost traumatic. I think if you can afford it and your wife is willing then it\u2019s definitely worth doing for your mental health. If not get a good friend to salvage as much as possible and do it asap so it can start growing again. You can invest in wigs. It\u2019s a fun way to experiment. I bought a few but my head is so big it\u2019s hard to get them to fit and I don\u2019t know how to properly install them. There are YouTube tutorials but I\u2019m so impatient. I\u2019ve worn them with ball caps a few times but it gets so hot and itchy. I think if they fit better I\u2019d like them better. Good luck! I hope you are able to do what you think is best for you!!", "YTA. I get it, hair is important but you should have gotten it cut when you realized that it would not be able to be cared for properly.

Maybe see if you can find someone willing to donate time or do it cheaply, maybe post on facebook looking for someone in the community who does hair under the table.

Your other posts seem to indicate your not entirely happy with your wife's choice to get bottom surgery. And it honestly seems like your taking this moment and attaching the negative feelings from your partner changing their body in a way they need because you don't feel like you can express those feelings while remaining supportive of their own choices.\n\n2) the loss of control is freaking terrifying for any human. In the span of a few short months it seems you lost most of the control of you have of your body and if I understand correctly your wife's decision is fairly recent, a big part of your relationship is going to change with this decision and you really have no say in it. Taking charge of your hair is something youve found some control in. \n\n1+2 b) related to both of those. Displaced jealousy. Your wife is taking control of her own body and what she needs to feel comfortable in her own skin. Your 6 months into a recovery that you've been told has a 6-12 month timeline and seeing no progress. \n\nBut $5,000 on hair when there is no income at the moment is a foolish idea. What happens if an emergency happens tomorrow? Neither of you are currently working and what little savings you have could mean the difference from an appedicitis bankrupting you and coasting through.\n\nAnd ultimately, I don't think making this appointment is going to make you feel better because it really doesn't seem like the hair is the problem. Its just what your brain sees as the safest outlet. You'll get it done but all those other problems will still be there and you'll still feel angry/sad/scared/whatever.\n\nTalk to your wife about how you feel. Your feelings are valid. They do not make you any less supportive. This is probably something she has been thinking about for years before vocalizing it to you. So it may seem everything's going so fast to you but she's been wanting for this for a long time and she's probably not realizing you still need time to process these changes and how they will impact your life and relationship. You really need the chance to express how scary/saddening/whatever these changes are for you. \n\nIf you really don't know how to broach any of these issues, take that 5k, go to a therapist and work through your feelings and then ask your wife to attend a session where your therapist can help facilitate a conversation on what your needs are too. \n\nYou will make it through this. \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA.

I used to have hair to my butt...detangling that much hair is it's own  skill.\n\nI cut mine off decades ago, because I was just plain sick of dealing with it.

I had multiple salons refuse to do it when I tried to get it cut short...literally say \"no, your hair is too beautiful, we won't cut that off\" and then look at me as if I  were nuts for even considering it.

My husband and I have an inside joke where I always say \u201cI married him in sickness and in health; he married me in sickness and manageable sickness\u201d.  As an acknowledgment that he knew I would never be the definition of health as I live with a mental illness that is chronic, but also as a reminder that I appreciate him loving me through all that. \n\nThere\u2019s a level of care expected when you get sick but I feel like, especially when I was in the thickest parts of chemo, there\u2019s an entitlement some spouses have, without the acknowledgment of the work and trauma their spouse is going through. My husband has never expected an apology from me, and I\u2019ve never been horrifically awful, but he\u2019s told me that me even acknowledging that maybe I said something in a way that was harsher because I didn\u2019t feel good, made him feel seen. Our spouses/partners are many times collateral damage and their pain is many times overlooked and not acknowledged. They can feel invisible. My oncologist asked my husband at every appointment how he was doing and if he needed any support. Illnesses or major life events regarding health, impact not only the main person but their support system and especially spouses/partners and leaving them to feel invisible only leads to resentment. Spouses feel that burnout. \n\nI had to cut a friend off because my husband came in one day from work and told me, that he needed a night away with his brothers, and that he set up for some friends to come be with me for the night. Got my favorite snacks and edibles (thank you legal weed!). Made sure I was set up. One of the people I had decided to invite decided this was UNACCEPTABLE. I let her know that my husband was telling me he needed to rest. Not that he needed a break from me, but that he needed a rest. I said he can\u2019t be the best version of who I need if he isn\u2019t rested. \n\nAll marriage really is, is resentment and load management. Right now, the load is tipped towards you, so you need to make sure that the resentment balance doesn\u2019t tip too far either. \n\nBasically, right now OP, your spouse is prioritizing YOU and YOUR needs, because currently they are the most pressing, and also because the partnership ultimately needs both of you. She\u2019s also burning out. She\u2019s carrying the weight of caring for you, caring for your child, financial stresses and putting her own health on the back burner. That 5k, will just be another tick on the resentment scale, likely in a massive way. It\u2019s hair. As a cancer survivor, my suggestion would be cut the hair; and buy a good quality wig. Hell, shockingly (I\u2019m a Black woman) Amazon has some great fucking wigs. \n\nYour wife needs a break and you need to really check in with yourself and see how you are treating her and at least acknowledge her sacrifices. From experience and observation, spouses understand that it\u2019s part of the territory, but they still want to be acknowledged (I do want to say. I don\u2019t think sick spouses need to go over the top etc, and if your partner is making you feel like you owe them for abiding by their vows, that\u2019s an issue to explore.

Have your wife or someone else you trust work on your hair while you listen to good podcasts, music or watch a good tv show.\nTry reading through this thread from a few years ago for some great tips and advise:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/femalehairadvice/comments/ly34yn/help_to_dematt_this_please_info_in_comments/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n(I love the WD-40 on your brush tip in this thread, though I've never tried that myself!)", "I agree.

OP has lost almost all control of their body.  It\u2019s a nightmare fuel situation.  Of course she wants to have some control over something.  She\u2019s human.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make her decision right, but it does mean we shouldn\u2019t be so derisive to her.", "On what world does it take six hours a month to brush hair?!", "I also have long hair and feel really bad, but if it progresses in hours that\u2019s a huge thing to manage. And you said it would taken a few hours to untangle in the early stages, that\u2019s a lot of time for something that could have to be redone regularly. I\u2019m not pointing fingers at anyone, but it\u2019s simply not realistic to keep such long hair at the moment. Nor is it to spend $5k on it when you said yourself money is extremely tight, especially with a kid at home and a wife who also needs surgery. It really sucks, but maybe some fun hair dye could help you find new ways to express yourself and your identity?", "Dude, you\u2019ve kicked the can down the road long enough.

If you\u2019re interested at all I\u2019m willing to talk with you more about this and maybe figure something out.

No worries if not, and I wish you the best of luck regardless!", "I have a little experience detangling matted hair.\n\nWhat is your hair type?", "As a nurse that worked in the ICU fresh out of nursing school and started Feb 2020, I wish we had the time to manage hair care. I had usually 3 patients per night and there was barely enough time to get the necessities done, much less comb through and braid someone\u2019s hair. Sometimes you\u2019d be in the middle of a patients bath and then someone would code down the hall, then someone would be crawling out of bed, then you finally get to finish your patients bath and meds are due, then someone else tries to die, etc etc. Your nurses are never intentionally being neglectful, there\u2019s just not enough hours in our 12 hour shifts (which usually turn into 13 or more) for everything, so we have to prioritize. Ultimately, your hair isn\u2019t going to kill you, but someone not getting their medication could. \n\nMoral of the story:\n1) your nurse/your family\u2019s nurse wishes they could do more but we just can\u2019t\n2) advocate for safer nursing ratios", "As an ICU nurse, it\u2019s pretty unfair to claim neglect by caregivers when we don\u2019t know the circumstances. Literally sometimes all you can do is make sure you keep your patients alive by the end of the shift. To comb out hair that OP is describing would take a nurse hours, too. And as others have pointed out, we often barely have time to pee, eat or take a break. We have more than one patient to consider. I love it when I can tend to my patients needs, give them holistic, loving care like washing and brushing out their hair, or braiding it. But that almost never happened. And it would fall low on my list of priorities on any given day, unfortunately. I am so sorry that OP is grieving this loss, new way of life, and changing identity in her hair. But given the severity of her illness, and extreme length of her hair, it probably couldn\u2019t be helped. And that\u2019s not one persons fault. It\u2019s an unfair situation all around.", "I'm an ICU nurse. I sure don't have time to comb super long hair like that. We try to put peoples hair in a bun on the top of their head, but with that much hair, that would be impossible. She's alive. She was bathed. Nobody neglected her. It would basically be impossible to keep the hair like that brushed out. All we have are big cheap chunky combs. Our job is not to keep up hair like that.  We do the best we can, but our job is not keep up hair that unbelievably long. If you want me to, I won't get my other patients bathed or meds given. Someone else's family member could fall out of bed, or take a turn for the worse. Or sit in their own stool for way too long.", "If nursing didn't have to work short staffed so often, things like this wouldn't happen. It is basic but it truly is low priority task if there just isn't enough time. \n\nAnd if she wasn't unable to sit up, it is not going to be the same quick, simple task. Many basic things are instantly time consuming if a person can't move well or support themself just because of the re-positioning needed to get it done. \n\nIt would have been nice of her wife to take care of it at the beginning.. but I'm also not sure what else she had to do for OP while she was in hospital. I don't blame her wife for not wanting to try to detangle it now.", "And a $5k hair treatment is what?", "I read your username very wrong and was concerned for a second.", "Congratulations!

Congratulations.", "I used to spend HUNDREDS of dollars every few weeks getting my hair trimmed and highlighted. Then, we had a baby, and I left my job to stay home with my baby. Two years later, we had another baby. My hair became less of a priority. My kids are 10 & 12. They had haircuts a few weeks ago. I haven't even had a trim in two years, because MY KIDS' NEEDS COME FIRST. It would be selfish of me to go blow $300 on my hair, when my kids need food, or clothes, or money for activities like sports, swimming, etc. I'm hesitant to spend $300, and we have income coming in, and OP is willing to drop $5000, and compel her spouse to drive her 18 hours round trip, in order to TRY to salvage her hair. What happens if your wife lugs you and your child all over God's green Earth, and you end up having to get your head shaved anyway? Your relationship will NEVER recover. The only reason your wife is even entertaining this is because you're fucking manipulating her, but trying to make her think this is her fault.", "What I don't understand was why OP didn't cut her hair before it got this bad. She wouldn't have needed to shave everything off in the first place.\nYTA OP if you spend that money. Hair will grow back but you can cause irreparable damage on your own health finance and family. Hair will never be more important than that", "Yep. MI as well, and there was no way I could do that when I was caring for my sick mother. There wasn't enough money.", "Is this the US?", "I also think part of the reason she wants to blow $5k is that she is trying to penalize her wife for not caring for her hair. She doesn\u2019t seem to realize that PT is the quickest way to regain her ability to care for herself - and her hair style of choice.", "I think you probably hit the nail on the head here, hoping some kind stranger is willing to pay for it.", "Yeah this is some \"Noah get the boat\" type stuff, I can't believe anyone could be this selfish.\n\nIt's not just the money (which is terrible) it's to then put the need to continue caring for her hair on her already overloaded partner.", "You're right, and she came here so probably looking for more support than attacks. If I have nothing nice to say, better to say nothing at all!", "You could have requested a majority of the length cut at any time in the hospital.

I've had pts that didn't respond at all to immunoglobulins and no DTRs and still on the vent 2 yrs after their onset.", "If it works out for you to help OP, I would volunteer to assist.", "Beautifully put.", "Hair care is at the bottom of the list even when there is no pandemic. I learned  that on my first hospitalization and have refused to go in again unless I am freshly showered with clean hair.  Like literally sitting on a folding chair washing my hair because I was too weak to stand up but knew I would be stewing in my own funk for several days if I left before it was done.", "Long, fine, straight hair loves to tangle. I had to give up the long hair dream because of that", "Haircare is supposed to be done in the hospital. In the US, unfortunately, there\u2019s not enough staff available to do it. It\u2019s a sad reality, and it sucks. But until assistive personnel are paid more and nurses have fewer patients, it won\u2019t happen. \n\nI will also say that waist-length hair is more to care hot than even an unburdened healthcare worker should have to deal with. I think OP needs to adjust to keeping short hair.", "It is neglect and would have been treated as such if I had neglected to care for my clients' hair when I was a carer. Washing and brushing hair is an essential part of hygiene and is the care worker or nurse's responsibility when the patient can't do it for themselves. I realise they are massively over worked and underpaid, so I'm saying this with understanding of their position but it is a requirement when you're responsible for caring for someone.", "Hair care is basic hygiene. I only would have needed a quick brush and re-braid once a week. It\u2019s not the worst and most dangerous neglect but it is neglect . Imagine if I had a small child and didn\u2019t brush their hair at all.", "I think it\u2019s very easy for us to pass judgement here, but we need to keep in mind just how drastically OP\u2019s life has essentially fallen apart. I agree with you that, ultimately, she should shave her head and keep her hair shorter as it doesn\u2019t sound like they have the resources for this expensive hair treatment. Not to mention that the issue of not being able to brush her hair is still ongoing, so she could end up in this same situation again. But I imagine that for OP, after essentially becoming paralyzed, she feels that she has lost a big part of herself. She can no longer do the things she loves and is almost wholly dependent on everyone else in order to eat, turn on the TV, pick up a book, etc. That can feel very dehumanizing. She probably feels that her hair is the one thing that still makes her feel like herself. There are so many little defeats that come with chronic illnesses, it makes sense to me that she wants to hold on to one thing that she doesn\u2019t have to sacrifice. I empathize with her, though I\u2019m sad to see that she doesn\u2019t seem to understand the massive toll this is taking on her SO (who she is low-key blaming for this whole thing).", "That's a shit take. OP shouldn't spend the money on her hair but she's not selfish because she wants to. She's most likely traumatized and the hair is just another thing. OP you need a haircut and a therapist.

I think people are overestimating wildly how long it takes to run a brush through hair and put an elastic around it.", "I'm guessing at this point we aren't talking long dreadlocks, but rather that OP has a giant lump of hair matted right down to the scalp.  It's a lot harder (but certainly not impossible) to cut through a ball of hair like that, and even then it's still a lot of work to untangle what's left.\n\nI definitely feel for OP, since her hair is clearly a huge part of her identity.  She's in a very tough place emotionally.", "That mask is so good!", "Damn the AI for Ad-bots has gotten pretty good! /s\n\nI'm gonna go look this up cus I've been growing out my hair for donating and it gets tangley really often unless I brush it consistently throughout the day.", "When it's waist-length hair, and the person with it is incapacitated to the point where their neck can't support their head for long periods of time, as GB does, it complicates the situation considerably. It turns into a process that requires at least 2 people, sometimes 3, to turn the patient on their side, support them there as comfortably as possible, sometimes having to lift the patient to get the hair out from under them, and then slowly brush out the knots. This process would have to start over anytime the patient had to get a new test, do PT, get medication, be fed, or relieve themselves. It's something most nurses won't do, and op's wife was limited to an hour a day with OP and their doctors because of Covid restrictions. That hour would likely be spent learning how to care for OP and hearing more about her condition from her medical team, hair wouldn't be on anyone's priority list. Once OP was home their hair would have already been matted and turned into an hours-long task that would take OP's wife who was now solely doing those tasks above and more, as well as solely caring for their child and household, and preparing for their own surgery.   \nIt's a sad thing to have happened, but I don't see this as preventable without OP initially going to the hospital in a protective style so it wouldn't have the opportunity to get matted during their stay, and I think it's pretty easy to understand why that didn't happen.", "That was in the hospital.  \n\nShe can sit up now but it's too late.", "I can see if it is short hair but they would have to flip her and it was matted. It could take hours and hurt her. I know someone who was in the ICU and did not get their hair washed for a few months. I think with staffing shortages and Covid no one is going to brush a horse\u2019s mane of matted hair. Get a bob hair cut. Put your family above your hair.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being honest with yourself about the level of work that\u2019s required in order to care for hair that long. Even mid-back requires tons of brushing and maintenance (source: had for years.) Down to your butt? That\u2019s a *lot*, especially for someone who is already having to do all of your other care AND raise your child AND put all of their other needs on hold. \n\nI feel for you, I really do. I know what it is to be a disabled woman struggling with loss of independence. But it\u2019s time for you to accept the   reality of the situation and cut your hair.

Was it just washed while in a matted mess and left be?  \n\nYou have a responsibility as well. If you can afford $5k (and end right back to square one) you can give your wife a break and spend that money on someone coming in and brushing /washing/braiding your hair once a week. \n\nTake accountability and stop blaming your exhausted wife.", "Or you could have just gotten your hair cut when you got sick.

It took about a year, but she did get better. My point was that it doesn\u2019t take any effort at all to sit with your partner and brush their hair. To act like that\u2019s impossible or some great feat is ridiculous. Caring for a dementia patient full time and caring for someone with a TBI is different. I will admit my job as easier than yours by a lot.

Even if the patient has to pay for it out of pocket the option should still exist. Basic haircare is not a luxury imo", "Agreed.", "The complaint will likely just result in the specific people that took care of her getting disciplined. \n\nHospitals already know they're understaffed and care will suffer as a result.

I often encourage patients to make complaints when issues like this come up. We recently had a patient stuck in hospital and extra 3 days because there\u2019s no PT available on weekends.

I'd been thinking about it for awhile because I was sick of how unhealthy it felt. That episode gave me the boost I needed. I shaved it off, donated 14 inches to make wigs and I ended up LOVING having short hair.

Such a difficult journey.", "YTA, Sorry but I wont be sugar coating it for you, you have a wife who needs surgery, a daughter who needs fed and you need PT that you can't afford so to even consider spending $5k on your hair is ridiculous and selfish. You love your hair I get that, but you can't manage it and your poor wife is to exhausted to do it for you so what happens once your hair is looking great again then not getting looked after again, because your wife certainly wont look after it after you spending an insane amount of money that you desperately need elsewhere and not a single person will blame her for it except you because you already blame her for its condition, are you going to pay $5k each month to keep your hair looking great while your family goes hungry, your wife goes without surgery and gets worse and your health doesn't improve without PT.

I understand somewhat what you are feeling. I had 4 rounds of chemo for early breast cancer. I spent $2000 cold capping during chemo to save my hair, which mostly worked. It was important to me because I was working through treatment, in a public facing job and I didn\u2019t want my customers to know.  I still lost my eyebrows and eyelashes. But I was so grateful. Cost was not a problem for us though, so that\u2019s different. \nI now have metastatic breast cancer in my bones (for now). I will be on some kind of cancer medication/chemo for the rest of my life, until I run out of medications to take, and the cancer wins. At some point, I will probably have to take a medication that will make my hair fall out. And this time, I won\u2019t care. I\u2019ll just be happy to still be alive.  But I\u2019m gonna have some cute wigs and scarves and shit, though. \n\nI can\u2019t call you an asshole for wanting to keep your hair, but I feel like, for you, it makes sense to cut off the tangles and start over. Fresh start, new start, your hair will rise like the phoenix, just like you hopefully will, as your strength improves. Spend the $ on rehab/PT, get stronger. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.  You will never be able to back to where you were exactly,keeping your hair is not going to help you recover from this emotional and physical trauma.

My hair also ended up as a rats nest, but my mom was able to get someone to come into my PT place and detangle and cut it for a low price.  So, while I totally  understand, you're being an ass, you need PT, your wife needs surgery, I get not wanting to shave your head, but sometimes you gotta pick your battles and spending so much money to fix hair that can grow back is not the hill I'd want to die on(hopefully that makes sense.)

Many, many people face catastrophic medical bills after a major illness and as your care is ongoing, you may not even know what you will need in the future.

It's not your wife's issue or the clinical staff that they didn't brush your hair every day. Every one involved had more important priorities at the time than OPs hair. I've personally had pt with GB that lives in an long term acute care hospital due to complications from GB.\n\nOp is dealing with a lot of loss, you're valid in your feelings but that hair is not worth it and it's time for something new.

It grew back. I'm survived.\n\nWhen I got my second cancer, straight to the hairdresser. Didn't even wait for the chemo. My hair wasn't as long. That hair is also in the box. But what didn't get cut off, fell out. \n\nAfter that I said screw it. My hair is short and I cut it myself. I save so much time not having to wait for it to dry or pull out hair from the drain. \n\nMy point is cancel the appointment. You have bigger problems than your vanity. Don't be selfish. Look at the big picture. No one is going to have the time to do your hair.", "You wouldn't be the asshole, but I do feel like it would be a waste of money, and here is why: Your hair is going to become a tangled mess again becaise you can not handle the upkeep. My hair is also down to my butt, I have an autoimmune disease and mental health issues and caring for my hair is incredibly hard. It knots so easily and a lot of my hair gets ripped out because I don't condition it, brush it, and detangle it multiple times daily enough. I know your hair means a lot to you, I understand. I'm cutting mine off as well becaise I can't maintain it any longer. I wish the magic answer was to spend 5k and you have your hair back, but it's going to be an issue forever.

If it's USA, it seems you're on a low enough income scale to qualify for home healthcare workers. Look into it through department of human services. There should have been a social worker at the hospital who could guide you. \n\nAll that said, don't spend this money on your hair. It's not likely to be the same as it was anyway. You have other priorities, including your child. If you go through with this, YWBTA", "So you started dating when you were 15 and she was 23?", "NAH\n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole, because you're traumatised by what happened, and you're wavering on decisions made out of that trauma. I've been disabled for years; I lost my hair to lupus; I've had heart attacks and am in a wheelchair and all that shit. The paradigm shift can be immense.\n\nIt's *hard*. And when you lose parts of yourself that you love, that define you, that's HARD. And I don't think that the posters here, for the most part, get that. They don't get how much you're mourning who you were. They are expecting you to be completely rational; they are thinking of your wife, whose life has also greatly changed. But they mostly are not hearing YOU.\n\nIronically, my spouse is also disabled. I am our primary caretaker. They're a quadriplegic and they have longish hair. I maintain it as best I can. What they did is get an undercut, because their hair is very thick, and they keep it a few inches past their shoulders, to keep it manageable. It's more work for me, but I do this because my spouse deserves to have this dignity. They also had very long hair and it became a hopeless mess in the hospital, so we had it shaved but then we let it grow back out some.\n\nYour wife DOES need to do your hair and you ARE entitled to keep some of it. I think you should shave it off if it's an irreparable mess, and save the $5k. However, I think you should let it grow out after the shave. Compromise with her on the length. If she refuses to do your hair at all, then you guys need to find a caregiver who will tend to your physical needs. This is an adjustment for her, but you're also entitled to the dignity of having hair. It is not an imposition of you to have hair, no matter what people say. You don't need to go bald just to try to avoid being a burden, as *you are not a burden.*\n\nGood luck with your recovery.", "TF did I just read. YWBTA, this is unreasonable.", "YTA.

They told me originally that my out of pocket would be $350 (I have excellent insurance). It ended up being over $4000. That was for my $150k surgery. Plus, anesthesiologist fees, misc. doctor's fees, etc. I was in the hospital for 1 night. How long was OP in the hospital? What was the total for your hospital stay/recovery/rehab? Probably in the millions. $5000 probably won't even put a dent in those hospital bills.", "Well said!", "Yep. And the spouse WILL get custody in this situation, too.

I was a caregiver to my husband while he went through chemo for a rare form of very treatable Cancer. It was incredibly difficult, even though we knew he would be ok.

After all of the things needed to keep everyone else alive and fed and still alive, that extra 10 minutes a day (which won't be ten minutes, it will be a lot longer for a bedridden person that needs to be shifted) is just too much. The wife is doing all the parenting, all the house maintenance AND all the caregiving. There is no help, no back up. Just wife doing all the things. And adding ANYTHING more, even beauty maintenance, to the day is just too much. Where is that time going to come from? Which 10 minute doesn't get done, so OP can have excessively long hair?

There is a lot of grief that comes with illness and I think that\u2019s likely central to your current position. Like everything else, if takes time to work through.", "$5000 is a lot of money, especially since even if your hair is successfully unmatted you are going to have a ton of breakage and damage and will likely need to cut it shorter just to somewhat even it out. Even if your hair is in good enough shape currently, detangling it is going to do so much damage. And damaged hair mats up really easily and quickly. The reality is that after detangling, your hair is going to be much more difficult to manage than it was previously, likely needing to be brushed everyday in the morning and evening just to prevent re-matting. If someone isn't able to take the time to brush it out and it starts to mat again, it is going to hurt even more the next brushing. \n\nYour brushing sessions will likely become something that you and your partner start to dread because it means pain for you and more work for her. If your partner starts to avoid brushing your hair again, can you be sure that won't cause a rift in your relationship? Furthermore, if your finances become tighter or an emergency comes up, the $5000 is probably going to become a sore spot. Can you be sure that you won't feel constantly guilty or that she won't resent you? That no one is going to be weighing whether hair is worth whatever else it could have been spent on? It is easy to go into something thinking that you won't develop negative feelings about it later on, but we can't always control our emotional responses.\n\nI understand that your hair means so much, and probably feels like the one thing you can hold onto that is still you. But the reality is that no matter how successful the detangling is, your hair is not going to be the same. And if it isn't successful then you will be out both your hair and $5000. If you do shave your hair off then at least you will still have the money. Ultimately I think if you go through with the appointment that your relationship will suffer in the end and you will eventually be back at square one with matted hair and financially worse off.\n\nI think there is a part of you hoping that by posting here someone else will give you permission to spend the $5000 and absolve you of any guilt over it. I will give you that permission. But know that none of us commenting here can make sure that your decision won't have negative consequences. That is something you have to face on your own.", "YWBTA\n\nI am chronically ill. In 2013, I developed bilateral frozen shoulder. I could no longer comb my down-to-my-butt hair.

It's what responsible people do.", "Have you looked into the detangling preparations that they have out. I know one is called bedhead.

Have you considered shaving it and getting extensions? I've bought clip in extensions from a professional for way less than that amount.

This same coworker is still angry and comments whenever I bleach or dye my hair. Always says my natural hair is too pretty for such drastic changes.
