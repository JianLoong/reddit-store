My case was severe and I lost all strength in and control of my arms and legs. My face, arms, torso below the waist, and legs all feel like I put them to sleep and there is almost no feeling in those areas. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks. I required an ambulance to get me out of bed and appointments for 3 months. \n\nI have very long hair (down to my butt). It\u2019s always been very important to me. It makes me feel like me (which is super important when I have lost everything else. I have lost all ability to do things I am passionate about). Laying in a hospital bed is havoc on the hair. I asked my wife (43F) to brush it several times but it never happened (she\u2019s done what I needed otherwise). It did  hurt a bit as she knew how I feel about my hair. I asked the care staff at the hospital but they were too busy. By the time I got home my hair was in a horribly tangled braid. Pre-illness I could have gotten it free in a few hours but I couldn\u2019t control my hands at all. At this point my wife made a half effort to untangle it but lacked the patience for it. She called a few stylists to see if someone could come to our house to work on it but no dice. Over the next 3 months lying in bed my hair transformed into a hard, matted baseball on top of my head. When I could get out a bit we tried a few local salons but they had no idea how to fix it. All suggested shaving it off. And that hurts my heart a lot. It would take 6 years to grow back.\n\nThis brings me to the issue: there is a salon 9 hours away that specializes in this issue. I have an appointment next week after an 8 week wait. The problem? They believe it will take 20 hours over 4 days to fix it. The appointments will cost $4000 and it\u2019s another $600 at least for gas, hotel, food, and expenses.  We are not rich in good times but my wife has had to quit working to be home to care for me. My medical supplies have increased spending (it takes forever to get Medicaid to cover supplies). That is a disgusting amount of money we could really use elsewhere. If i felt like this was my fault I wouldn\u2019t even consider spending that money. I feel like my wife could have prevented this all by just brushing my hair. Or having a measure of patience to detangle it when I got home. Also, she clearly hates working on my hair and I will need someone to brush it (possibly forever). She\u2019s the only option. I know being a caregiver is hard enough. I don\u2019t want to be more of a burden.  There is also the chance none of this works and I have to pay a lot of money and still lose it. I could live with a shaved head, no matter how hard it would be. Tomorrow morning is my last chance to cancel and get most of my deposits back. Would I be the asshole for spending all this money on my hair?", "created_utc": 1685459113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vsrbe/wibta_to_pay_5k_to_not_shave_my_head/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a huge pain in the ass, it took ages, but we did manage to salvage most of her hair just fine and I am most certainly not a trained professional, I just soaked it in a ton of good detangler and sat there unpicking hairs bit by bit with a crochet hook and a large sewing needle. May I suggest seeing if that's something you could pay a friend or someone with time to spare who could use some extra cash a more reasonable amount to take a go at? There is plenty of info online about how to DIY this, and there are plenty of people who would spend the time for a few hundred dollars vs a few thousand. You're probably still going to need to cut it shorter, there will be breakage, but you likely won't need to shave your head. Have you tried reaching out to friends for help with this? That's how I ended up helping my friend with hers, she asked friends for help and I happened to be off work on crutches for a week and said I'd give it a shot.", "I'm sorry this is happening to you.\n\nYTA\n\nI'm sorry, but your medical condition has made  caring for your hair a burden to your SO.   Since she no longer has a job, your $5k ask is too much.  Shave your head and stop being selfish.  You need to make more reasonable priorities.\n\nAlso, once you spend the $5k, what happens next?  Your SO will continue to not brush your hair and you can't do it yourself.  You'll be back to square 1 in 6 months?  12?\n\n>And that hurts my heart a lot.\n\nIt hurts my heart that I didn't get to go to Space Camp.", "Sorry but yes you would be TA, and I really sympathize about your situation. It must be very hard but think about how hard it is for your wife and she has stuck by you and even now I didn't read that she said no once when you made these appointments.\n\nI would cancel the appointment and get my head shaved. I'm a balding male who hasn't cut his hair since pre-covid. I don't claim to know what it's like for a female to lose their hair, I do think it would be tougher for you than it would be for me. But that's $4k you might really desperately have needed at some point, don't do the wrong thing. It's fiscal responsibility versus vanity.\n\nI know it sounds bad but you can get a wig in the beginning and within 3 years your hair won't have grown all the way back but it will be a suitable length again. I promise it'll be fine. You won't have to wait 6 years and this time it'll be a more manageable length that can be maintained by a salon.\n\nIt's going to be a tough pill to swallow OP but I think you should take the L and also make your wife feel appreciated. She sounds like she's ride or die for you. When you have somebody like that in your corner you can handle being bald.", "I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole but I want you to consider, what is going to prevent your hair from becoming matted a second time? And a third? Your wife doesn\u2019t have the ability to maintain it - please consider what else she does in a single day and then add another hour of hair maintenance daily. Can she realistically do that? She might promise today but caregiver burnout is real and your hair seems like a real point of resentment for both of you. $5k is nothing to sneeze at when you are both seemingly unemployed/on a limited income if you have some benefits.\n\nAnd when your hair is detangled, it will be damaged. A hair stylist will recommend cutting it any way, it will be nothing your hair pre-matting.", "NAH caregiving is hard enough without salon work involved. And you should be able to keep your hair... but you need to figure this expense out. Do you have friends or family who would chip in? Maybe an online fundraiser would help?", "NAH, this is beyond being a tough situation for both of you.  What about a compromise.  Cut your hair to like shoulder level and then work on detangling?", "Shave your head and be done. Your situation sucks big time, but you\u2019re not thinking about this logically.

And your wife gets to not become your personal stylist. I don't think YTA for wanting to resolve the problem in your favor. We all identify ourselves to ourselves with certain markers, after all. Your key sign post is your long hair.

That's where the $5k should go, if you have a choice. Or for a part time in home help for your wife. Not your hair. Hair grows back. Hair is a luxury. Cancel this appointment if you care about getting better and spend the money on help for your wife and your therapy.", "Reading your comments it\u2019s sounds like you\u2019ve already made up your mind and you\u2019re just looking for validation.

So even if you get it \u201cfixed\u201d this time (five grand???Good grief!), will it happen again?\n\nFWIW, I had two friends who had extra long hair.

I also had long hair like that and I understand how it easely becomes some sort of personal trademark, but it's not healthy to let it define you, you are much more than that. I know now with everything you've been through, that it might seem as the last bit of your old self you think you can save, but you can look at your hair like memory, it grew with you and to some extent has physical remnants of everything you've lived through. But this last chapter of yours might be a sign to let it go now and start fresh. Better keep the money to make new and better memories for you and your wife. Really focus on recovery and be grateful for the people that are close to you now.

Having to give up something because of a physical illness is difficult, even more so when you realize it could be avoided if you could get other people to just do what you want them to do.

If, when you say, \"we could really use it elsewhere\" means that yes that amount would make life easier if put somewhere else (aka  maybe that could mean fixing a lose railing or allow more luxuries that were left behind once medical costs increased, etc etc). I'd say tell your wife that this is important to you, and say that you asked for  additional support to prevent this from happening as you were unable to do so, that you don't blame her for not being able to provide that support, but this is an incredibly important thing to you . \n\n However, if when you say you two could really use it elsewhere, in the sense that it means you are in crippling debt / at risk of losing car/income/support/home , then I'd say shave your head in pride , because sometimes we have to say no to things even if it hurts us , if it means to protect our family. \n\n\nAs much as I'd like to call your wife an asshole for not doing preventative maintenance on your hair , especially since you mentioned she lacked patience for it.

My heart goes out to you", "Considering how much it means to you, I'm shocked at your wife's unwillingness to help with your hair.

You've been dealt a serious blow to your health, you should be as happy with your looks as possible. But the situation being what it is...deep breaths and let go.", "I just don't understand why your wife couldn't brush your hair in the first place from the get go. It would have taken all of ten seconds. What an odd thing to refuse to do when you're caring for someone.", "NTA. Nobody in your life would brush your hair. It's their fault it got like that. And any money you spend will ne their fault as well. But I think it's important that you take the time to realize that if they wouldn't brudh it before, they aren't going to brush it after either. If you aren't capable of brushing it yourself it's just going to get tangled like that again. It would be a huge waste of money to detangle it knowing that nobody in your life will actually help keep it untangled.\nYour significant other is going to resent you spending the money. You obviously resent them not giving you the care you needed. I'm not suggesting a break up.

Are there any other compromises that are possible? I\u2019m envisioning the matting has happened bc your head is moving against your pillow so the knots are close to your scalp.

Her entire life has been turned on it's side and all she's know, her future etc changed in a matter of moments and she's doing the best she can. It is a LOT of work to care for someone in your situation and I'd hope you'd be appreciative that she is holding true to her vows to you and continuing to care for you in this extremely stressful and trying time.

My last haircut was 15 years ago. I get being attached to your long hair. But if your wife has to brush it from now on, you probably have to seriously compromise. Wishing you the best. Losing aspects of your identity is hard.", "Yeah. The more OP comments, the more...annoyed...I get! \n\nI used to work direct care, I managed homes for people with disabilities, my brother broke his back when I was in 8th grade and my mom had Alzheimer's.", "If you had those things in order this post wouldn't even have been made hon.", "Except for rehab/PT?!", "So you're a liar.   You just said you're not in rehab because you can't cover it.", "No you don\u2019t", "I mean this very politely, in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s hair (edit: it will grow back). You are alive, you\u2019re still together and you\u2019re getting your life back. You came here and asked to be judged, now you\u2019re mad I\u2019m giving my opinion. It honestly sounds like you\u2019re angry at the world, and have hyper focused on one thing that you can blame your wife for. You\u2019re ignoring that you both were doing life together, sharing the burden 50/50 roughly. She took on 100% of the burden of daily life plus became your caretaker; a full time job in itself. She lost her job, your hair seems like a small sacrifice to what she has already sacrificed for you. \n\nAgain, I sympathize it\u2019s a horrible disease, you\u2019re scared you\u2019ll lose everything, there\u2019s no lead up that something\u2019s wrong you just can\u2019t function one day. I\u2019m very sorry you\u2019re going through it, I just think perspective and sympathy would do you both a load of good.", "I have not guilted her into anything and she is not appeasing me. I have not blamed her or guilted her. She  had no idea this would be the outcome and she feels awful and wants to fix it.", "Because I still have personal guilt about spending the money.", "The way it is matted up my options are shave or detangle the whole thing.", "This is an important point.  Just the idea of long long hair really grosses me out.  Like super long fingernails.  Sounds like it's way past being even faintly attractive.", "I have not guilt tripped my wife. And yes, I do know how hard it is. And I would have gladly done it for her. Sorry this is enraging you so. For the record, on her own she has accepted that while it isn\u2019t her fault and she could have prevented the situation I am in now.", "It is matted in a ball tight against my head. There is no compromise or I would have just done it already. It\u2019s either detangle the whole thing or shave it completely. This cannot be combed out.", "What I mean is that if I do my hair or not all of those items are paid for.", "I am not in rehab and PT is in an awkward spot right now. But money will not fix the issue.", "Wife gave up a job, financial stability, and did literally everything else and even agreed to do something she clearly hates and isn't necessary for OP. \n\nOP is disregarding her partners feelings completely (read the comments too!) and wants to spend money they can't afford for hair that's probably damaged beyond repair anyway.\n\nLong hair is hard work no matter what OP says. Wife is absolutely not an asshole!", "You blamed her in your post.  I doubt you were able to hide that from her.", "You are blaming her. \u201cHad she kept it up until I was out of the hospital\u201d She quit her job to be a caregiver and you\u2019ve said it takes you with your experience with your hair 10 min to brush it at that length and she was only able to be at the hospital for less than an hour a day due to the distance. You expected her to spend 20% of her limited time to be with you and get information about your care from the doctors to brush out your hair. \n\nYou also say you\u2019ve had no improvement in 6 months and you want to drop this huge amount of money. What happens if you have no improvement in 12 months? It\u2019s too much money when your resources are already limited by you both not working. It\u2019s a very irresponsible financial decision and your hair won\u2019t be anything like it was before. It will be unhealthy that you\u2019re better off growing it out fresh", "Then save the money. It will grow back.\n\nRead gift of the magi.", "Personal guilt is the opposite of interpersonal conflict. It is intrapersonal conflict", "Is the guilt because it would put off your partner being able to have their own surgery?", "I know you don't feel this way right now but there is a possibility that if you shave it off, you'll absolutely love the result!  It could be quite freeing!  I wish you luck.", "Even wanting to spend $5k when you both aren't working so you can have your long hair back (and makes it where she has to brush it from now on) is a guilt trip.  \n\nYou are prioritizing hair over food, a roof, PT, medical bills, etc.   You're valuing the hair over her.  \n\nEven considering doing this is a guilt trip.  No one should ever want to spend $5k on hair when the family unit is in this state.  The level of self obsession needed to even ***think*** about it is insane.  Who could possibly think this is ok?  \n\nHonestly, if you do this she should leave.  She should not be a carer for someone that values her this little to dump even more on her like this ***and*** dump more financial burden on her.  She needs to be free if this is how you thank her for what she's done.  \n\nI am a big believer in wedding vows and \"for better or for worse\" but only if the other partner still respects the other as a person.  Had you accepted that your hair had to go, I'd be in full support of her needing to figure out how to care for you and make it work.  But no... she's just there for your whims if you seriously think this is OK.   She's not a person but just something that cares for you and does what you want in your eyes if you really find this plan acceptable.  If you do this, you're showing you don't respect her as a person.   She should leave.", "With all due respect: Do you honestly think your WIFE, who has been taking care of you, who QUIT HER JOB to care for you, doesn't know you blame her when you type: \"**Had she kept it up until I was out of the hospital I would have gladly comprised and cut it shorter.**\" Do you HONESTLY believe she doesn't know you resent her for that?\n\nJFC! You were in a hospital bed for how long??? Do you have any CLUE how hard it is to brush someone's hair when they are lying in a hospital bed? How impossible it is to wash using a bedside hair wash pan. Then to attempt drying it. Meanwhile, if it is not dried properly, it could lead to bead sore on your head, neck and back because your hair is wet while you are in bed!\n\nYou are absolutely blaming your wife for what happened to your hair. She feels guilty about it so is willing to allow you to spend an insane amount of money to MAYBE fix it!\n\nI am sorry for what is happening to you but GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR A$$! Especially, if you want your wife to be with you a year from now, when you are facing eviction because Social Security, SSI and SSI-E won't cover the rent payments, she may or may not get reimbursed at 20 cents above minimum wage to provide your direct care, and you are eating from food banks and SNAP benefits! How much will she resent you then when you wasted $5K for your vanity?\n\nIs this harsh? YES. Absolutely. But this is your new reality! You need to start facing it NOW!", "As someone who spent 30 seconds a day on my hair when it was just below my shoulder-blades, and about 10 now that it's shorter, 10 minutes is a long time. Realistically, 10 minutes out of a day is a medium commitment, it's not a small on, but also not huge, for anything. 10 minutes a day when that's the only thing they have to do, not bad. 10 minutes a day on top of everything else, it's a lot.\n\nI'm currently out with long covid, and I don't have it as bad as you by any means, but my partner doesn't have the energy to pick up the slack I leave on my medium-bad days, and I don't have energy to catch up on my good days. Adding 10 minutes a day of anything for either of us would really derail something else, and put us that much further behind. Respectfully, I think you should cut it, have them save as much length as they can, but keep it at a shorter length until you can take care of it yourself without impacting more essential tasks.\n\nETA: many others have covered the money angle, but don't spend money you don't have on non-essentials, especially when you aren't in a position to have secure increased income in the very very near future.", "That's still an hour every week added to your wife's work load. I'm so sorry this is happening. Use the money for something that could help your condition, like PT, therapy to deal with the grief and stress on both of you, maybe a cleaner to deep clean the house so it's one less thing on your wife's plate. Maybe some sheet masks and take out so you can have a fun movie night in bed and to show you appreciate her? I know this situation sucks. Wish you the best! I'm sick myself and know all that comes with it for both you and your partner.", "Of recovery is 6-12 months and you haven't progressed in 6 months why aren't you spending that money on physical therapy that could help you progress?...

Can't you give up your hair for her???", "Why is everyone downvoting you for explaining that this isn\u2019t just a little bit of tangles?

When is she going to be able to retire?\n\n-----\n\nJesus Christ.

Stroke victims\u2026people who experience debilitating illnesses that cost them muscle loss and stamina loss..do not recover that magically without putting in the PT work.  \n\nMoney would pay for PT and allow you to start the long road to recovery that you have put off for six months. It\u2019s not going it get better just sitting there hoping and wishing it does. You have to do the work and invest in your health.  Not your hair.", "OP, I\u2019m going to be kind because I know this situation sucks all around. Some of your comments make it seem like you are blaming her for this, like if she cares enough she would have just brushed it out. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the case, but they come off as blame. She seems to be feeling it herself and is really acting like it. People have told you that she may be fatigued herself, and I seem to feel like this might be the case. Maybe address how you feel with her and possibly accept the situation eventually? It\u2019s not great for you, but it\u2019s not ideal for her either.", "I did NOT blame her. Read again.

No matter how you spin it or maybe that tangle is pulling a little tight, what you are doing is indeed blaming her.", "My kid is fine thanks for asking. I do a lot to take care of her still. And this has nothing to do with my wife\u2019s surgery. She\u2019s dealing with that in other ways. However, some of my guilt about the money are related to that."]}
