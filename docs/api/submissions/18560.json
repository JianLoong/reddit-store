My case was severe and I lost all strength in and control of my arms and legs. My face, arms, torso below the waist, and legs all feel like I put them to sleep and there is almost no feeling in those areas. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks. I required an ambulance to get me out of bed and appointments for 3 months. \n\nI have very long hair (down to my butt). It\u2019s always been very important to me. It makes me feel like me (which is super important when I have lost everything else. I have lost all ability to do things I am passionate about). Laying in a hospital bed is havoc on the hair. I asked my wife (43F) to brush it several times but it never happened (she\u2019s done what I needed otherwise). It did  hurt a bit as she knew how I feel about my hair. I asked the care staff at the hospital but they were too busy. By the time I got home my hair was in a horribly tangled braid. Pre-illness I could have gotten it free in a few hours but I couldn\u2019t control my hands at all. At this point my wife made a half effort to untangle it but lacked the patience for it. She called a few stylists to see if someone could come to our house to work on it but no dice. Over the next 3 months lying in bed my hair transformed into a hard, matted baseball on top of my head. When I could get out a bit we tried a few local salons but they had no idea how to fix it. All suggested shaving it off. And that hurts my heart a lot. It would take 6 years to grow back.\n\nThis brings me to the issue: there is a salon 9 hours away that specializes in this issue. I have an appointment next week after an 8 week wait. The problem? They believe it will take 20 hours over 4 days to fix it. The appointments will cost $4000 and it\u2019s another $600 at least for gas, hotel, food, and expenses.  We are not rich in good times but my wife has had to quit working to be home to care for me. My medical supplies have increased spending (it takes forever to get Medicaid to cover supplies). That is a disgusting amount of money we could really use elsewhere. If i felt like this was my fault I wouldn\u2019t even consider spending that money. I feel like my wife could have prevented this all by just brushing my hair. Or having a measure of patience to detangle it when I got home. Also, she clearly hates working on my hair and I will need someone to brush it (possibly forever). She\u2019s the only option. I know being a caregiver is hard enough. I don\u2019t want to be more of a burden.  There is also the chance none of this works and I have to pay a lot of money and still lose it. I could live with a shaved head, no matter how hard it would be. Tomorrow morning is my last chance to cancel and get most of my deposits back. Would I be the asshole for spending all this money on my hair?", "created_utc": 1685459113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vsrbe/wibta_to_pay_5k_to_not_shave_my_head/", "score": 990, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a huge pain in the ass, it took ages, but we did manage to salvage most of her hair just fine and I am most certainly not a trained professional, I just soaked it in a ton of good detangler and sat there unpicking hairs bit by bit with a crochet hook and a large sewing needle. May I suggest seeing if that's something you could pay a friend or someone with time to spare who could use some extra cash a more reasonable amount to take a go at? There is plenty of info online about how to DIY this, and there are plenty of people who would spend the time for a few hundred dollars vs a few thousand. You're probably still going to need to cut it shorter, there will be breakage, but you likely won't need to shave your head. Have you tried reaching out to friends for help with this? That's how I ended up helping my friend with hers, she asked friends for help and I happened to be off work on crutches for a week and said I'd give it a shot.", "I'm sorry this is happening to you.\n\nYTA\n\nI'm sorry, but your medical condition has made  caring for your hair a burden to your SO.   Since she no longer has a job, your $5k ask is too much.  Shave your head and stop being selfish.  You need to make more reasonable priorities.\n\nAlso, once you spend the $5k, what happens next?  Your SO will continue to not brush your hair and you can't do it yourself.  You'll be back to square 1 in 6 months?  12?\n\n>And that hurts my heart a lot.\n\nIt hurts my heart that I didn't get to go to Space Camp.", "Sorry but yes you would be TA, and I really sympathize about your situation. It must be very hard but think about how hard it is for your wife and she has stuck by you and even now I didn't read that she said no once when you made these appointments.\n\nI would cancel the appointment and get my head shaved. I'm a balding male who hasn't cut his hair since pre-covid. I don't claim to know what it's like for a female to lose their hair, I do think it would be tougher for you than it would be for me. But that's $4k you might really desperately have needed at some point, don't do the wrong thing. It's fiscal responsibility versus vanity.\n\nI know it sounds bad but you can get a wig in the beginning and within 3 years your hair won't have grown all the way back but it will be a suitable length again. I promise it'll be fine. You won't have to wait 6 years and this time it'll be a more manageable length that can be maintained by a salon.\n\nIt's going to be a tough pill to swallow OP but I think you should take the L and also make your wife feel appreciated. She sounds like she's ride or die for you. When you have somebody like that in your corner you can handle being bald.", "I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole but I want you to consider, what is going to prevent your hair from becoming matted a second time? And a third? Your wife doesn\u2019t have the ability to maintain it - please consider what else she does in a single day and then add another hour of hair maintenance daily. Can she realistically do that? She might promise today but caregiver burnout is real and your hair seems like a real point of resentment for both of you. $5k is nothing to sneeze at when you are both seemingly unemployed/on a limited income if you have some benefits.\n\nAnd when your hair is detangled, it will be damaged. A hair stylist will recommend cutting it any way, it will be nothing your hair pre-matting.", "NAH caregiving is hard enough without salon work involved. And you should be able to keep your hair... but you need to figure this expense out. Do you have friends or family who would chip in? Maybe an online fundraiser would help?", "NAH, this is beyond being a tough situation for both of you.  What about a compromise.

So even if you get it \u201cfixed\u201d this time (five grand???Good grief!), will it happen again?\n\nFWIW, I had two friends who had extra long hair.

I know now with everything you've been through, that it might seem as the last bit of your old self you think you can save, but you can look at your hair like memory, it grew with you and to some extent has physical remnants of everything you've lived through. But this last chapter of yours might be a sign to let it go now and start fresh. Better keep the money to make new and better memories for you and your wife. Really focus on recovery and be grateful for the people that are close to you now.

Having to give up something because of a physical illness is difficult, even more so when you realize it could be avoided if you could get other people to just do what you want them to do.

If, when you say, \"we could really use it elsewhere\" means that yes that amount would make life easier if put somewhere else (aka  maybe that could mean fixing a lose railing or allow more luxuries that were left behind once medical costs increased, etc etc). I'd say tell your wife that this is important to you, and say that you asked for  additional support to prevent this from happening as you were unable to do so, that you don't blame her for not being able to provide that support, but this is an incredibly important thing to you . \n\n However, if when you say you two could really use it elsewhere, in the sense that it means you are in crippling debt / at risk of losing car/income/support/home , then I'd say shave your head in pride , because sometimes we have to say no to things even if it hurts us , if it means to protect our family. \n\n\nAs much as I'd like to call your wife an asshole for not doing preventative maintenance on your hair , especially since you mentioned she lacked patience for it.

My heart goes out to you", "Considering how much it means to you, I'm shocked at your wife's unwillingness to help with your hair.

Nobody in your life would brush your hair. It's their fault it got like that. And any money you spend will ne their fault as well. But I think it's important that you take the time to realize that if they wouldn't brudh it before, they aren't going to brush it after either. If you aren't capable of brushing it yourself it's just going to get tangled like that again. It would be a huge waste of money to detangle it knowing that nobody in your life will actually help keep it untangled.\nYour significant other is going to resent you spending the money. You obviously resent them not giving you the care you needed. I'm not suggesting a break up.

My case was severe and I lost all strength in and control of my arms and legs. My face, arms, torso below the waist, and legs all feel like I put them to sleep and there is almost no feeling in those areas. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks. I required an ambulance to get me out of bed and appointments for 3 months. \n\nI have very long hair (down to my butt). It\u2019s always been very important to me. It makes me feel like me (which is super important when I have lost everything else. I have lost all ability to do things I am passionate about). Laying in a hospital bed is havoc on the hair. I asked my wife (43F) to brush it several times but it never happened (she\u2019s done what I needed otherwise). It did  hurt a bit as she knew how I feel about my hair.

Pre-illness I could have gotten it free in a few hours but I couldn\u2019t control my hands at all. At this point my wife made a half effort to untangle it but lacked the patience for it. She called a few stylists to see if someone could come to our house to work on it but no dice. Over the next 3 months lying in bed my hair transformed into a hard, matted baseball on top of my head. When I could get out a bit we tried a few local salons but they had no idea how to fix it. All suggested shaving it off. And that hurts my heart a lot.

They believe it will take 20 hours over 4 days to fix it. The appointments will cost $4000 and it\u2019s another $600 at least for gas, hotel, food, and expenses.  We are not rich in good times but my wife has had to quit working to be home to care for me. My medical supplies have increased spending (it takes forever to get Medicaid to cover supplies).

I feel like my wife could have prevented this all by just brushing my hair. Or having a measure of patience to detangle it when I got home. Also, she clearly hates working on my hair and I will need someone to brush it (possibly forever). She\u2019s the only option. I know being a caregiver is hard enough. I don\u2019t want to be more of a burden.  There is also the chance none of this works and I have to pay a lot of money and still lose it. I could live with a shaved head, no matter how hard it would be. Tomorrow morning is my last chance to cancel and get most of my deposits back.

After several months he started to recover. Thanks to excellent care in a rehab facility and a lot of PT, he is now fully recovered and doing all his usual activities, so that may give you hope.

Her entire life has been turned on it's side and all she's know, her future etc changed in a matter of moments and she's doing the best she can. It is a LOT of work to care for someone in your situation and I'd hope you'd be appreciative that she is holding true to her vows to you and continuing to care for you in this extremely stressful and trying time. She clearly loves you very much but she is also clearly not capable of taking on every aspect of your care. Your wife is NOT the only option and to place her in that position is not only unfair it's unrealistic.\n\nHowever - you're now in this situation and are faced with 2 options. 1 reasonable, and 1 completely unreasonable and unacceptable.

Start fresh. It might surprise you how light it feels. I shaved mine in lockdown and actually it grew back in so much better than before I shaved it, and detangling will not leave it looking as it did before so you might be left with a 5k bill for having to chop it all off anyway. But then, instead of spending 5k, be generous with a budget for a beautiful wig (or even a couple). A lady I see doing the school runs, I happened to notice one day that her hair was buzzcut short and I was shocked because she had such beautiful hair the day before. Next day, the hair was back. Turns out, been wigs all along. She changes her style a lot but they all look incredibly natural. My nana also wears one, though I always forget.

If you can find someone to work on your hair with that spray, you might be able to get the mat untangled. \n\nMy thin, fine, mid-back hair took probably three hours, but I had to take multiple breaks, because I was so weak. You obviously can't do this yourself, but someone standing behind you, working on your hair, might be a lot quicker. I found that, once I got the untangling started, it went pretty fast. It took almost as long to find an area of mattage that would start to untangle as it did to finish the process once the matting started to give way. \n\nYou're not TA for wanting to hold on to a part of you that means so much to your identity, especially when you've lost so much.

Alot of times by the time theyd get dropped off theyd be in disarray and extremely mistreated by family members. Only ratty t shirts and sweat pants. Short crew cuts for females. No makeup. No jewelery. No patience for their confusion. They treated them like burdens when it got too difficult instead of asking for outside help and let it get too far and mistreated their loved ones.

Not to take away from how hard this has been on your partner, which people have already pointed out, but I think most of these responses are not being very compassionate towards what you\u2019re going through, losing your entire sense of self and giving up everything you enjoy because of an illness is so, so hard.

If it was something she had the capacity for she would already be doing it and you\u2019re setting yourself up for a lot of frustration and disappointment on both sides.
