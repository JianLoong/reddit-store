My sister-in-law (my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife) is the one who turned this into an issue because she told me it was rude for us to cut the cake without the birthday boy and I should make my son wait since my husband would be home \u201csoon\u201d. I know my husband and soon could mean anywhere from 20 mins to 3 hours and I wasn\u2019t going to wait that long so I gave my son the cake.\n\nMultiple people told me I shouldn\u2019t have done it after my sister-in-law spoke up and I\u2019ll be honest, they were getting under my skin since why should my son miss out on the cake because his dad is late?\n\nMy husband came home over an hour later and when he saw the cake he jokingly told our son off for stealing his cake but he wasn\u2019t being serious. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695208457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nil52/aita_for_letting_my_son_eat_my_husbands_birthday/", "score": 537, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is this an American thing?", "Soft YTA. In principle, if your husband doesn't really care about the cake, its not like your toddler having a piece early ruins his experience.  However, you are teaching toddler that his wants come first. There is a certain tradition to cut the cake together and if there is a delay, it's unfortunate but a part of life. He could have had a different dessert, maybe a piece of fruit, and had some cake next day. And this was toddler's gift to his dad. What if he gifts another kid a toy, does he also get to play with it first?", "YTA. The birthday cake was for your husband, not your son. If the timing wasn\u2019t going to work out, you could have just told your son he can have some of the cake tomorrow & given him another snack. If I were your husband, I would have been hurt. I kinda suspect you did that b/c you were miffed your husband\u2019s meeting ran long & he missed the bday dinner you planned for him. I get that. If he does that kind of thing often, you need to voice your frustration & let him know he\u2019s responsible for respecting your time & effort too.", "Who could possibly give a shit? Your husband clearly didn't. It's a cheap birthday cake for a grown-ass adult who doesn't even really like cake, it literally couldn't possibly be any more inconsequential.\n\nEdit: having read more of this thread, people seem to REALLY care about the rightful recipient of cake.", "Light YTA. The whole point of birthday cake is to celebrate the birthday boy\u2019s birthday. Giving your kid a slice of someone else\u2019s cake early was unnecessary and sends the wrong message, IMO.

I think the only person in the world i wouldnt be upset for that being done is my kid.\n\nIts not that deep.", "NTA. He missed the dinner you planned including dessert. From what you've said, he wasn't really anyicipating a big cake-cutting hoop-de-doo. You gave your kid some dessert before bed, knowing that your husband wouldn't be fussed. It's no big deal. You'll have plenty of opportunities to teach your child about patience and delayed gratification.", "NTA he\u2019s an adult, I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t dying to blow out his candles. I\u2019m sure all the YTA\u2019s are still kids that celebrate their bday and demand everyone do the same lol", "Nta because if the husband doesn't care why does it matter? It was his cake?

Your husband doesn't care and your family is making an issue where there is none. You can tell them noted, I won't let anyone have any cake ahead of time on your birthday. I see this is very important to you and I will keep that in mind.\n\nLike you said, you didn't know if your husband was getting home in 20 minutes or 3 hours and starting a cake situation minutes before your kid was supposed to be in bed was going to suck.  Do the people complaining about you feeding your son cake and not have kids? Blah blah blah to the people saying the kid is old enough to wait or understand that someone else's cake. Sure, lots of us are old enough for plenty of things but there was not an issue here. It's cake, she decided to give the kids something they had been looking forward to.  The issue is the in-laws, not the cake, you, your kid or your husband.\n\nI'm so curious, but they have been as inflamed if it was cupcakes instead of a wholw cake? If they had all needed to leave after waiting several hours for your husband, would they not have been irritated not to have cake? Would they not have hoped to have been sent home with a piece of cake?  Are they all 11?", "NTA Holy shit people it's a damn kid, the husbands kid at that who turned out not to care. Bet the husband would have given his own son whos needs should come first the first piece cut.\n\nGet a grip, no grown ass adult should have an issue with this.", "NTA - Your husband is not three years old, which is why he did not take grave offense that there was a slice cut out of his birthday cake. Your son, however, is three, and he should be able to participate without fucking up his general structure and routine. You did what was practical.\n\nBesides, that's your kid and your rules. Ultimately, this is the only explanation anyone needs for how you handled the situation.\n\nSIL and those that think this should be an issue are the ones acting like spoiled three year olds.\n\nEDIT a word", "christ it\u2019s a cake. do people not have enough other problems to get pissed about?", "Ehh, very light YTA. Although your husband said he doesn't care, it's also not a great lesson to give your son the first slice of someone else's cake. You don't want him thinking that's the way it goes.

I agree with someone else that you could have waited to give him a piece the next day after your husband cuts it.", "NTA and JFC I can\u2019t believe all the posts saying otherwise.

The same people who were making a big deal out of something as trivial as when a three-yeae-old eats some birthday cake would have found a reason to co.e down on you. Husband was home after bedtime? Why didn't you let the kid have cake on his daddy's birthday? Husband was home just before bedtime? It's too close to bed to give the child cake. \n\nObviously, your husband wasn't upset. So there's nothing to fight about.", "NTA it\u2019s not a big deal.", "OK, but your husband is an actual adult, right, not a ten-year-old standing on a friends shoulders in a trench-coat?\n\nBecause your reasons for doing it this way are reasonable and we're all adults, so who cares, right?\n\nNTA.", "To all the people saying YTA, you clearly don\u2019t have a toddler?! When they helped choose it and were patiently waiting for \u2018after dinner\u2019 to have some, it\u2019s very cruel to then say no, because some meeting overran. They don\u2019t understand. The cake is probably the highlight of their day. The dad clearly didn\u2019t care, and if anything was probably happy to see their child happy. They\u2019re still getting a cake, does anyone really care if a tiny bit is missing? We\u2019re talking about slightly upsetting a grown man about a huge cake missing one slice for their child, or hugely upsetting a patient child who was promised something they were really looking forward to.

If your husband doesn\u2019t give a damn about it, it is a non-issue. No-one else\u2019s opinion matters here. \n\nI remember being about 7 or so and making a cake (with my mum and younger sister) to welcome home my dad after he\u2019d been away on army manoeuvres for a few weeks. We sat there for ages, waiting for him to come home so we could have some cake. We went to bed and he still wasn\u2019t home. Us kids were upset twice over, he wasn\u2019t home and we didn\u2019t get cake because mum insisted it was dad\u2019s cake, not ours. He turned up after 10pm because he\u2019d gone to the pub to get drunk after work instead of coming straight home. It\u2019s been 50 years and I remember it. A three year old is much less likely to remember long term but may well have been bitterly disappointed at the time not to be allowed the cake he\u2019d been looking forward to.

You are not wrong.", "NTA. You didn't make a big deal about it spitefully, you had a good reason for giving your kiddo a slice of cake (didn't want him sugared up before bed), your husband wasn't bothered by it, which I assume you knew he wouldn't be when you did it. If he would have been bothered, this would be a different issue.", "NTA and lots of commenters here have clearly never parented a 3 yo.

But what dad is going to begrudge his sleepy three-year old a piece of cake?", "I\u2019m sorry, have you been raised by wolves or something? Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing but I\u2019m baffled you think it\u2019s ok to cut a birthday cake before the birthday person arrives at the celebration. \n\nWhat about your son, how can you not be concerned about the total disregard of basic manners you taught him? \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nBut not really so much about the cake itself - I suspect that you just wanted to avoid telling your child \"no\" or \"wait\" and everyone will eventually pay that price.

Your husband wasn\u2019t upset so what\u2019s the problem?", "Your husband didn't care presumably because he's an adult and not a child, so I fail to see why this became an issue. NTA. The people voting otherwise are being ridiculous.", "NTA - sounds like you know your family dynamic and your husband better than your SIL and internet strangers.", "NTA - your husband is  the father of a 3 year old and understands that his birthday cake will be eaten early so that his son can go to bed without being hopped up on sugar. Your three year old is young enough to have his routine set by his parents, and you know both of them well enough to control the situation in a way that satisfies all family needs.
