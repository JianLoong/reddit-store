Now I had all the kids with me to go visit a relative in the hospital, everyone got grabbed out of school for it.\n\nThe hospital was a 3 hour drive and we went up this morning. By lunch everyone was starving so we stopped by Chick Fi La. There is a trend of putting the mac and cheese on the sandwich with a sauce. Jack mentioned this and I told him I will not buy him more food if he does it and he doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nWell he did it and he hated it. Now everything was touching so he couldn\u2019t just eat the sandwich after taking it off. I didn\u2019t buy him more food like I said and he didn\u2019t eat his concoction that he made.\n\n\nAfter that we drove back home and he was really hungry. My wife came home and he started telling her how I starved him. We got in argument for not buying him more even though we could afford it.Both of them think I am a huge jerk for this.\n\nAITA should I have just bought more.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have sensory issue and he is only allergic to cats. We had him tested. If he doesn\u2019t find the taste up to his liking he won\u2019t eat it. This includes leftovers, same meal he liked before isnt worth eating as a leftover\n\nGuys this kids has been tested, the school checks for being on the spectrum, he\u2019s not on it.

He can safely work a stove, oven, and microwave. If you try to force him, he sounds like the type that will dig in and it will make it worse. It also sounds like your wife may not support that tactic either so maybe create a scenario where he feels more in control. At the same time, he needs to learn to carry the water of his preferences. It may not be his fault that he feels this way but the world will not pander to him like his parents will.

If you were out of money or this was an extra trip at his request that he was using his allowance for sure I can see prefacing with \u201cI will not provide a safety net in the instance if this is how you spend your money/the last of our money.\u201d But you say you had enough, this was a scheduled family meal, and just didn\u2019t buy him something else to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d. \n\nWhat is the lesson? To never try new foods? I\u2019m confused if you want him to stay picky or if you want him to grow out of it. He won\u2019t grow out of it if he doesn\u2019t have the freedom and comfort to experiment with reasonable support. He\u2019s 14, it is your responsibility to feed him adequately even if he tries something new and doesn\u2019t like it. If he were 18 with a job maybe I see setting some boundaries about wasting your money, but this is not that. Minor teenagers are still children.", "NTA, but remember that 1) he's 14 2) it seems like he has some sensory issues, that he's more of a texture eater and 3) as a picky eater myself, trying something new gives me straight anxiety. It's truly a feat whenever someone who is a picky eater actually try something new. While he shouldn't have put the Mac and cheese all over it and just on a slice, he's 14 so he's not really thinking properly. But next time, an idea to do would be to get him a new food but also get him a food just in case he doesn't like the new food. Sure, you're buying more food for one kid and that's annoying, but this can teach him that trying new foods is a positive thing, and that you don't have to worry about \"starving\" your kid. If you use this as a punishment, then it could make him feel like he should never try new foods, which will be even more frustrating since he's already a bad picky eater.", "YTA. Trying weird food combos is a fun thing to do. You tried to make some big lesson out of the situation, and instead you could have ordered an extra Mac and cheese sandwich for everyone to sample.", "INFO: OP, have you had him evaluated for any type of sensory or food aversion disorder? My oldest child (7) and my brother   (mid-30s) are both similar about food.m, but\u2026 \n\nMy brother never got evaluated (and he mostly doesn\u2019t eat well). My oldest child is autistic and has food aversion issues (which we have been addressing and he\u2019s trying new foods now). You\u2019d be amazed at the difference in willingness to eat food when the \u2018picky eater\u2019 has good supports in place.", "Nah. Your kid did a dumb thing because kids do dumb things. This is natural consequences. I\u2019m a super picky eater with an eating disorder so I almost never order anything \u201cnew\u201d I try new foods, but at home or if I\u2019m with someone that ordered the \u201cnew\u201d food, so I can taste it without the risk of not having anything to eat if I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t think your 14yo is TA here for making a poor decision and you\u2019re not TA for sticking to what you said. \n \nJust to be clear tho, the picky eating/not being able to eat foods touching are sensory issues. So your son almost certainly does have sensory issues. It\u2019s something he needs to learn to cope with and that means not ordering foods he might not like without a backup safe food. Having sensory issues doesn\u2019t mean he can throw away food and be rewarded with a second meal, it just means he needs to choose food he knows he likes in the first place. I\u2019ve never been to that fast food place, but I\u2019m sure your son has and he knew of a meal he could get and eat there and chose to order something different.", "You said you've had him tested and if he truly isn't autistic then NTA but I would still look into that. Some doctors can miss miss or overlook things. I'm an autistic adult and I physically can't get certain foods down. Even if it doesn't taste horrible a lot of things will make me gag and I have very limited safe foods. Sometimes I desperately wanna try new things but am too afraid of going hungry and ruining my entire meal, maybe he was just being stubborn but if it's a pattern please think about retesting bc if so a diagnosis and education will drastically improve your and his lives !", "YTA for poor planning. I would not have let him get the sandwich. I would suggest bringing snacks on a long car trip so you don't have to buy food while on the trip and your teen has something to eat.

My teen gets hypoglycemic so we try to make sure we have food she can eat, since she is also a picky eater and has diet restrictions.

What he shoulda done was tried it, but also gotten something else that was small with it for backup (let\u2019s say I went mcdonalds to try a new burger or something, i might order a brownie too just in case the burger doesn\u2019t please me, and at least i\u2019ll have a safe food to rely on).", "NTA because at 14 he's old enough to be able to make a decision about food and live with the consequences for a little while.\n\nBut I \\*am\\* going to push back on something.  Isn't one of the challenges of dealing with picky eaters the fact that they refuse to try something new and instead just stick to the same old thing, forcing everyone to conform to their choices?\n\nYour son seems to have wanted to try something new.  And that behavior was punished.  He knows now that if he does want to go out on a limb and try something new, you're not going to have his back in case it doesn't work out, he's going to have to go hungry instead.  So if you want to encourage him to be a more adventurous eater, making him go without when he tried (even though he got the idea from TikTok, I get why that'd be annoying), is not going to encourage him.  He's going to stick to his guns and remain a picky eater.", "NTA he is 14 a few hours with out food ain\u2019t going to kill him. When they are hungry enough they will eat any thing", "NTA\n\nI agree with other commenters that this is not about the picky eating as it is about him doing something & not accepting the consequences of his actions. He could have cut off a piece of the sandwich & just tried a little mac in that. Then he would have still had more food to eat. This was a learning experience for him.

If a parent makes a food and the kid doesn\u2019t like it they withhold food.  Not for an hour but till the next day. Especially if a kid tried it said they didn\u2019t like it and parents keep putting it on plate because parent enjoys it.  Eventually it gets to a point where kids learn that it is better to stick to a few they can handle then trying something new and not having a parent yell at them if they didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not till they are older and in the comfort of their own home where if they try something new and don\u2019t like it there are other options for them that they can branch out.\n\nI am a picky eater like your son. I am well into adulthood and a lot of times as I got older food that I wouldn\u2019t eat because of texture or taste I can now eat. My parents tried to have me early on try new foods but I just couldn\u2019t.  I have found ways as an adult now to enjoy food I wouldn\u2019t touch. If I can have Broccoli smothered in some kind of sauce I can handle it. Same with a lot of veggies tbh as long as they have a strong flavor and are cooked in it I can handle.  Corn and Potatoes are the only ones I can eat the normal way people do.  \n\nWhile I do understand and somewhat agree with what you did as a mild consequence your attitude towards him isn\u2019t ok.  This can be fear based, neurodivergent behavior, allergies hidden, or parent is a horrible cook.  There are a lot of reasons for a kid to be picky.  A parent can go to a party where a kid is happily eating chips with salsa but won\u2019t put a tomato on a burger. A kid might avoid the boiled broccoli of parents but will happily eat broccoli smothered in cheese at a friends house.", "YTA. I'm a picky eater but it comes from my ADHD. But my parents didn't know that and I've had food literally shoved into my mouth and I was forced to eat things that made me vomit. Now I am extremely anxious to try new foods even when I want to.

She let me open green beans and eat only the beans inside and in order for that to happen I required every member of my family to guess how many beans were inside each green bean pod before I opened it. She made them participate. I had zero sensory issues, no eating disorder, not on the spectrum nothing I just learned that she would cater to me so I took full advantage. Once I fell pregnant at 19 I was forced to fend for myself and eat things as they were I was spending my own money and my own things and couldn\u2019t afford to waste it because I was picky. Once there was nobody to cater to me and I had a baby to keep healthy I started eating normally. I eat pretty much anything now and only have a handful of foods I refuse. This 14 year old is pulling bullshit. If he made a choice to try a TikTok trend so he can be cool but didn\u2019t like it that\u2019s on him. Eat it or starve. Fuck that nonsense.

I avoid new foods even though I now know my triggers, because the mentality that I just dislike things was drilled into me by my loved ones.

Behaviors like forcing a child to eat cold leftovers in the morning because they genuinely didn\u2019t like them last night isn\u2019t doing anything to help their palate expand. Making minor modifications to your cooking to accommodate is a much better approach- and allowing your kid to experiment and open up to new flavors as they decide to is ultimately more effective. \n\nI take this from experience.
