During my \"better years\" I met my now girlfriend (22f) and we have been dating for little over a year now. \n\nMy girlfriend knows about my diagnosis and I have been talking about it pretty openly even before we officially started dating. She has been fine with it for this whole time and told me that she understands that the symptoms might come back when I have warned her. Well, if you didn't already guess, few weeks ago I started to show symptoms.\n\nThe incident I am here to actually talk about happened yesterday when I asked my girlfriend to cuddle with me because I was feeling down. We cuddled for maybe a minute or two before my girlfriend started to talk about her day. I was really not on the mood to hear about her coffee date with the girls and asked if we could just lay quietly. After a few minutes she started to talk again and again I asked can we just lay here and not talk. Well this happened third time after few minutes and I got irritated and raised my voice little (emphasis on little) and basically told her to just please shut up. She understandably got upset but now she is being still mad at me even though I apologized. The reason being she felt like I didn't mean it cause I tried to explain why I said what I said (or something like that, she doesn't really want to talk to me).\n\nSo am I the asshole? I know I shouldn't have snapped like that but I apologized and genuinely meant it. If I am an asshole I will totally try to make this up to her but in the past I have let people step on me just cause I can't think rationally when I already feel like I am the worst person in the whole world.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all of you for the answers. I will apologize again. Now I am wondering if I should break up if she doesn't leave me. I have seen what a toxic and controlling relationship can do to a person and the last thing I want to do is to make her miserable like that.\n\nAlso many of you told me to seek help which I have already done.

Sure, there could have been a better way to handle it (i.e. you could've told her you'll listen to her later, and given her an approximate time frame), but you did ask her to quietly cuddle.

This just really feels like a moment of conflicting needs. She wanted to tell you about her day because she loves you, which normally you wouldn\u2019t have a problem with.

Or maybe you can give yourself a time like \u201ccan we lay here quietly for ten minutes\u201d.\n\nETA: My partner will sometimes ask for space after a difficult day. I used to give him what I thought was enough time/space (but it wasn\u2019t in his opinion).

Aside from lacking basic empathy, they don\u2019t seem to understand the basic give and take nature of successful relationships. Being a couple does not require strict equality all the time at every moment. It\u2019s okay to ask for what you specifically need in a moment as long as you give back what the other person needs in other moments.\n\nGF was giving in that OP asked for cuddles and she agreed, but her giving only went so far.

This incuriosity is troubling. \n\nIt is true that relationships where giving/taking are largely one-sided are not healthy, but there is little evidence of that here.

YTA\n\nI also definitely see her side where she feels your apology wasn\u2019t genuine because you explained yourself (if you explained like you did here). While it\u2019s important she understand where you were coming from, it can come off as trying to excuse what you did. \n\nYou need to tell her that you\u2019re sorry for what you did, and that the reasons why you acted that way don\u2019t excuse that behavior.", "My wife suffers from depression. Even after learning a lot about depression it's still incredibly difficult to understand exactly how she feels when she is depressed.", "Exactly, or just because they too have depression doesn't mean they know what you need, because everyone reacts to depression differently. It's a delicate balance.", "Thank you for the piece on apologies! I think thats a distinction that OP might not be getting. GF might need some time, then again, she might not forgive this one...its hard to read tone, but most OPs try to minimize their actions...and maybe it's my interpretation, but im feeling like there may have been a bit of tone as it comes off as a demand rather than a request. \n\nI don't think OP meant to be the AH here, and at the end of the day I think there is some work to be done on OPs communication skills...something additional that a therapist can assist with.", "The companion animal bit, at least in my suggestion, has 0 to do with confiding in someone emotionally and everything to do with cuddling to something in silence.", "holy moly thank you! a voice of reason. he didn't even say he yelled at her. he \"raised\" his voice which could be a wide range of things. yet i read comments about him screaming at her -.-", "I can't help be I had to scroll this far to read this. I'm baffled that people think he is so in the wrong here. Nothing is wrong with asking someone to sit and cuddle in silence!", "I don't feel like it is mental health shaming to acknowledge that people without mood disorders have feelings, too.", "This isn\u2019t mental health shaming. It\u2019s response shaming. In therapy you learn it\u2019s ok to feel your feelings but you need to learn how to control your reactions. You can cuddle & just let her talk so that both parties are getting their needs met. You don\u2019t get to just boss people around and tell them to shut up & except them to want to continue to comfort you", "How do you know the GF didn't have as important of a need to communicate about her day?  Why does this OP's desire for quiet trump her desire to connect? She offered cuddles, not silence, and that is absolutely a fair boundary to have.\n\nActually, this comment helps to make it clear just how much TA OP really is.", "OP raised his voice and told her to shut up.  What do you mean he didn't snap?", "No, that\u2019s not even remotely similar.", "And he didn\u2019t listen when she wanted to talk about her day. She cuddled him like **he wanted** and instead of being respectful and listening to her day like **she wanted** he told her to shut up like **he wanted**. He\u2019s the **only one** getting his needs met. Relationships are a two way street compromise and he decided that he is the only one who gets his needs met. It\u2019s selfish, disrespectful, and instead of communicating in a proper manner he told her to shut up and then gave an insincere apology.", "She laid there and cuddled with him, which is what he asked. She also stayed silent for a while as well.   She actively tried to help him and comfort him while he shut down her attempts to communicate with him.", "She\u2019s not his emotional support animal", "She did listen and did cuddle for a while. Then she started talking.", "It\u2019s very difficult to describe. :/", "Snapping would be his first reaction was to yell and tell her to shut up. She disrespected him first by continuing to talk when he asked for her to please not to. She could have gotten up and said I don\u2019t feel like laying down. Instead she chose to ignore his requests. \n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, relationships are a two way street. She wasn\u2019t listening to what he needed in that moment. A short while of silence and simply being in each others company is not at all a lot to ask for. There is plenty of time to talk about her day after that moment. She was repeatedly asked for just a short while of silence and she would not listen and only did what she wanted to do not taking into account his feelings and needs. Seriously if the roles are reversed you all would be saying NTA.", "You can\u2019t just claim iF rOlEs wErE rEvErSeD. That\u2019s ridiculous. Gender doesn\u2019t matter. If one partner asks to cuddle and they get cuddles and the other partner wants to talk they get to talk. End of discussion. She did already do what he wanted. She was cuddling him! She also didn\u2019t ask him to talk. She wasn\u2019t asking anything of him other than to listen. He was not only asking her for the cuddles he received but also telling her **not** to do something. It\u2019s not really respectful to tell your partner to shut up. Ever. It\u2019s just not an appropriate way to talk to a partner. They can talk all they want. They are their own person. She was respecting his feelings by cuddling him and not asking him to talk or converse back with her. And he was trying to steamroll her and ignore all of her feelings. You either understand how a healthy adult relationship would work, or you don\u2019t. \n\nAnd frankly, it\u2019s very insulting, sexist, and disrespectful to assume people would change their view if the roles were reversed. When I want to cuddle I ask my husband to cuddle because I need comfort. If he wants to talk about Star Wars and computer games even if I\u2019m not in a mood for talking I still listen because **I give a shit about my partner**. If I told him to shut up I absolutely would be an AH", "I feel like you are having a hard time understanding his point of view. Presumably you don\u2019t suffer from mental illness, and that\u2019s wonderful for you. Or even have a personality type that needs quiet time without constant communication to function. News flash, not everyone is like that. Who says both partners need both of their needs meet in the exact same instant in time? That\u2019s ridiculous. Every moment of a couples life simple cannot meet both of their needs simultaneously all of the time. Both of their needs, his for a moment of comfort and silence and hers to talk about her day simply cannot happen at the same time. Hence the  very simple idea of doing one at a time. Like I said previously, let him have his quiet time first (he definitely was in greater need to have his needs meet first in this instance) and then later talk about her day. What\u2019s so hard about that for you to understand?", "I actually have diagnosed depression adhd and other health issues on top of that so thank you for your highly incorrect and rude assumptions. Me having mental health issues does not allow me to be a bad partner. There is a reason the vast majority of this thread is YTA, and it\u2019s not because OP is a man, and it\u2019s not because commenters don\u2019t have mental health issues. Which by the way is a logical fallacy, it\u2019s called an Ad Hominem, you were attempting to discredit my position because you assumed I didn\u2019t have mental health issues which even though I do is irrelevant to the discussion. Attack the argument not the person. I hope you have a pleasant evening but since you\u2019ve made quite a few disrespectful assumptions (people are sexist, people who disagree don\u2019t have mental health issues) I do not feel comfortable continuing this conversation with you since you\u2019re not a conversation you\u2019re trying to attack. Have a good night.", "Seriously? Did you even read what I wrote? I said \u201cpresumably\u201d not \u201cyou 100% don\u2019t have any mental health issues\u201d. And I said \u201cor a personality type that needs quiet time to function\u201d. You didn\u2019t respond that the latter point at all. You also didn\u2019t respond to anything I said in the last 2/3 of my comment. You are the one who is not open to a conversation and is constantly attacking me. Please give your opinions on the points that I have actually made instead of twisting my words. Good evening"]}
