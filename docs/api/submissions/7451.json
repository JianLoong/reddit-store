We looked everywhere and found nothing, then my BIL said maybe the cleaning lady took it,but of course I didn't believe that because we've known her for years and she never took anything that wasn't hers, and we told him that but he insisted that maybe it was her, so my mother-in-law said that the best thing would be to check the cameras just in case, and when she said that my BIL turned pale and began to say that it was not necessary because he saw that she (the cleaning lady) took it. \n\nLong story short, when they left we checked the cameras because we couldn't believe what he said and we found out that he was the one who took the boxes. We talked to him and he just justified himself by saying that he only wanted money to ask a girl out. My husband told him that he should have asked him for money and not steal our things but he said that his parents told him never to ask his brother for money. They are a very poor family and although my husband now has money and can afford many things for them they never wanted him to help them, It's like they don't want their son, who is younger than them, to give them money because it makes them feel like failures, so I know he is right about that but he should not have done what he did. If we hadn't had the cameras in our daughter's room he could have caused someone to lose their job and it's not fair and he needs to learn a lesson, so I told him that until he learns to behave he can't come to our house. And now my mom thinks I was too harsh, that he's just a kid and that I should understand him. But I'm not going to change my mind, am I the asshole?\n\n\nedit: All my daughters have their ears pierced, here it is normal for babies' ears to be pierced when they are a few weeks old, I guess it's cultural differences I don't know, anyway I didn't ask about it so I don't understand why y'all are judging me for it.", "created_utc": 1673843100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d4xbn/aita_for_banning_my_bil_from_my_house/", "score": 2022, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nah.. he deserved what you did.", "After getting past your ages and baby-making timeline, NTA. Who excuses thievery? He stole. He's 16, not 6. Tell him next time you're pressing charges. Did you even get the jewelry back? If not, how is he going to pay you back? Because he needs to.", "NTA. However, the punishment has to match the crime. Not going to your home is nothing to a 16 year old kid who steals and lies. In a way it\u2019s better for him because he won\u2019t have to face you. He needs to give back the earrings and apologize! to your face!", "NTA. He stole then lied about it & could have gotten your cleaning person fired or even arrested. 16 years old may still be considered a kid, but is definitely old enough to know you don\u2019t steal.", "NTA. Once he steals from you as a guest in your home, that trust is broken. He\u2019s got to earn it back, and even after he does I\u2019m not leaving him unsupervised in my home at all except when he\u2019s in the bathroom (and I\u2019m walking him to and from the bathroom if he has to go).\n\nYou don\u2019t steal from family who\u2019s invited you into their home. I would tell your husband to look out for warning signs that his brother is on drugs. Unfortunately this is one of the signs that he may be, when they begin stealing from family. Been there, seen it.", "NTA, he stole from you guys and LIED to your faces lol. And then doubled down by saying he saw her lol. \n\nWhy invite him into your house immediately to find your camera blind spots and steal again.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\n\n16 is old enough to know stealing is a literal crime.", "NTA. He stole from you and then, to try to hide it, he put the blame on someone innocent. All because he wanted to impress a girl. \n\nBasically, you can\u2019t trust him anymore. And he isn\u2019t \u201cjust a kid\u201d - he is 16, definitely old enough to know what he did was wrong, and old enough that, if he doesn\u2019t face consequences for what he did, he will do it again.", "NTA. And from what you\u2019ve said, he isn\u2019t remorseful. The way I see it:\n1) You are being fair and protecting an employee that you have a certain level of responsibility to\n2) He was willing to make someone lose their livelihood so he could impress a girl and only admitted it when he had no other option\n3) Not allowing him in your home when he has proven untrustworthy isn\u2019t harming him. He\u2019s simply not allowed.", "NTA.\n\nHe stole from you, tried to pin the blame on the innocent housekeeper, and deserves to be banned from your house. \n\nHe's 16 years old. He should know that stealing is wrong. If he wants some money to take a girl out, he can figure out how to make pocket money by running errands even if he can't get a teenage fast food job or something. What does he think she would think of him if she found out he bought her dinner or movie by stealing from his aunt and uncle?\n\nI wouldn't trust him. He doesn't need to hang out at your place, so too bad.", "I think what I\u2019d do is show the video to his mother. Realistically, he lied out of shame and just hoped he wouldn\u2019t be found out. But\u2026 the view thst he needed the money? That he knew where to sell the jewelry? That suggests that he has done something like that before. \n\nI understand the impulse and I would come up with a concrete set of criteria for him going forward. He has to pay you back or return the jewelry. He also has to make penance in some other way. If he needs the money, maybe you can arrange for him to work or do tasks for some money. Then he would t have to ask, your husband can \u201cgive,\u201d and he has a means to earn. \n\nAnd work with his mother to arrange some other punishment or way to observe and confirm the amount of trust that can be given him.", "NTA for enforcing a consequence (steal from us and you aren\u2019t welcome in our home) especially because he hasn\u2019t shown any remorse. \n\nHaving said that, he\u2019s a 16 year old kid living in poverty, watching his nieces live a very different life, unable to even ask for help because of his parents pride. \n\nAre you and your husband able to find other ways to support him?", "NTA  \n\nAt 16 your BIL is a thief and a liar.   I think it's likely that that jewelry weren't the first things he has stolen.  \n\nI think banning him from your home is an excellent idea.", "NTA. I would not let him back in my house at all. He is too proud to ask for help, but is ok with stealing from your babies? Some set of values he's been taught.\n\nYour mom is being silly, a 16 year old knows right from wrong, and he knows that taking something that does not belong to him is wrong.\n\nI would make it clear that he is to pay you back for the earrings and necklace, if it takes him years to do it. He needs real consequences, not just a slap on the wrist.", "NTA. He\u2019s 16, he knew what he was doing and then tried to blame it on someone else. That and he did it to ask out a girl? Really. Maybe it should be explained to him that money won\u2019t help her truly like him\u2026 seems like he has a warped idea of love.", "Yeah, sorry, I could get over the fact that your husband was 28 when you were 19 and pregnant.  \ud83e\udd22", "NTA but your in laws are for that level of pride. How does a 16 year old think it's better to steal than to ask for money from his brother.", "NTA - \n\nIf he would have gotten away with it then he may have become emboldened and continued to  steal anytime he 'wanted' anything.  I believe his actions should have consequences, not just 'don't do that'.  Hopefully by being caught it has taught him a lesson and he won't do this again.  \n\nHe's SIXTEEN, certainly old enough to know better - his parents not being affluent and his brother being fairly better off is NO excuse.  Maybe his lesson should be  - work hard and you can afford things like your brother - not steal FROM YOUR BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY!!\n\nI also agree that on top of it all he lied and could have gotten an innocent woman fired from her job - so his actions were no doubt, egregious on more than one front!", "NTA at all.\n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to your in-laws *to an extent.* Poverty sucks and asking for money (even when you really need it) feels awful because you feel inadequate as a parent to provide for your family. **But** the in-laws\u2019 reaction really sullied that sympathy. ~~The kid was totally unapologetic and MIL basically suggested he did nothing wrong.~~ Did MIL have anything to say about it?\n\nAt least demand a real apology before letting BIL back into the house. ~~And MIL, I\u2019m not sure what her reaction was about\u2026. It sounds like she\u2019s a big help to you when she comes over, but what\u2019s with the defense of her son\u2019s theft? If she brings that up again, you should make it clear that BIL is fully in the wrong and you don\u2019t want to hear anything more about it til he apologizes.~~ *Sorry, I misread \u201cmother\u201d as MIL!\n\nWhere\u2019s your husband on this? I think if the subject comes up again, he should probably be the one to talk it over with them since they\u2019re his direct family.", "I think the ban is fair. He could have cost someone their job and lively hood making false accusations like that. Just so he could impress a girl. I would at least if he\u2019s already sold the jewellery then he would be working to pay back the total they cost before being allowed in my home again", "NTA. Theft is unacceptable. Did the brother seem concerned by revoking his visiting privileges? If this isn't a restorative punishment, then I would be concerned about what else he would be willing to steal. His behaviour will have consequences if not redirected.", "NTA; he was dishonest and is certainly old enough to know right from wrong.  He could have cost a honest person their job. He needs to understand consequences.", "NTA, but banning him from the house is probably not the best punishment, because it kind of sweeps it under the rug for everyone.\n\nI'd rather see him give the stuff back, apologize to you and the cleaning lady, tell the girl that he wanted to date that he stole from his brother, and do some work around the house to make up for his stealing and lying. If he does all that and shows remorse, you could let him visit again (but keep the cameras running).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hes in a hard place with his parents not allowing him to seek help from his brother. \n\nYou would be right to be wary on future visits, but I think a discussion with your husbands parents is required so that your husband can maybe pay his brother a small allowance so that he can do teenage things. Put terms and conditions on it and ensure BIL is onboard with all of them.", "Soft YTA\n\nKids get passes we don't give to adults. They make mistakes and are intended to learn their lesson.\n\n\"Until he learns to behave\" is super vague. That's not an actual path to redemption, which is what a child who made a mistake deserves. It's too arbitrary and subjective.\n\nAt the end of the day you have a right to say who's allowed in your house and who isn't, for any or no reason at all.\n\nBut, the general vibe you give is that you treat these people as family, not strangers. The sentiments you expressed for MIL show that. So, if BIL is 'inner circle' family and not 'outer circle' family, then you are more involved with the teaching of this lesson than if he was 'outer family.' Which means you need to teach it better than with vague nothings.\n\nIf you weren't so close with that side of the family this would rule otherwise. But the implied closeness puts this more on you than it would otherwise be, because this is a child.\n\nBut it's not like he can do all that much since you have cameras. There's little actual threat to your home or belongings. Frankly I'm surprised you didn't check the cameras *before* they left.\n\nGiven that he's not actually a threat, an indefinite ban is a bit overkill.

He shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to ask for help, and stealing from your family and blaming it on someone else is just wrong.\n\nOver time, hopefully you can mend the relationship.

BIL might not understand how wrong it is to take things from a brother he perceives as rich, but how can he not understand the seriousness of the false accusation of  a poor cleaning lady?\n\nPlease talk to your husband about how he wants to deal with this in a way that will help your BIL understand the seriousness of what he did, but that won't cut you and your husband and children off from your MIL.", "NTA.. did he return the jewelry? \nHe is a thief and a liar and was willing to hurt an innocent person by shifting blame.

No matter what, that woman is ***NOT*** a family member and the consequences to her - an innocent person in all this - would be so much more severe (OP says herself, losing her job) than any consequence the son might experience. **He\u2019s 16, not 6.** To deliberately cause serious harm to an innocent person because he wanted to take a girl out is disgraceful and he\u2019s certainly old enough to know that.

Mistake has multiple meaning and \"bad choices\" are one of them just as much as \"accidents\" are.\n\nCalling what the kid did a mistake does not inherently mean that it wasn't on purpose.\n\nAgain, the only reason I ruled this way is because she's basically treating this BIL as if it was her own kid. I already said if she wasn't so close to them the ruling would flip.\n\nImagine if a mother threw her own 16 year old out of the house because he stole something and said he was banned from ever returning.\n\nThat the BIL doesn't actually live there and isn't actually her kid makes a significant difference, but she is close enough to this side of the family that she should be treating this kid as if it was her own... in spite of the 7 year age difference; she's an adult, he's not. If anything, treat him like a younger sibling that she as the older sibling is helping to raise... which it basically is. And, she's crossed the line into adulthood as far as that 'helping to raise' expectation goes, so long as this is family she's considering herself close to.\n\nThat she banned him from the house isn't really the AH part. It's that she did so vaguely and indefinitely and without an actual path of redemption. What does the BIL have to do to be allowed back? Give him some way to earn it, whatever that way is.\n\nThat effort being required to earn a way back into the house is the lesson. Simply banning him completely is *a* lesson but not an appropriate one for a close family member/sibling like this.\n\nNot giving the kid any metric by which to redeem himself basically implies that there is no redemption possible which is a horrible thing to do to a kid. And certainly isn't going to teach them to make better choices, which is the responsibility of any adults raising that child to teach.", "This sounds like an appropriate punishment for a 16 year old. \n\nWhen I was 5 or so, I stole a little hot wheels car from a drug store.

The latter doesn\u2019t. There is absolutely no comparison.\n\nBanned until they decide to give him another chance is 100% fair and reasonable. When will that be? When he decides that instead of stealing from people and blaming others for it in order to take a girl out he gets his own damn PT job - and acts on it.
