This pregnancy has been incredibly difficult for me and husband (25m) has been incredibly supportive of my. My mother has been criticizing all the choices we have made during my pregnancy, but recently she has gone over the line.\n\nHusband and I have major anxiety issues and have laid out plans and rules about my pregnancy, what happens while I'm pregnant and what happens in the hospital and after due to a high complication and a previous miscarriage. Husband and I have discussed how he would not like to be in the room when I give birth (I was the one to bring it up) as he would be extremely anxious and there would be a high possibility of him passing out with how anxious he would be. This is something we talk about often and we are both okay with the choice. As much as I would love him in the room with me I respect his decision and I wouldn't argue over it as I can see his point of view and how passing out in a situation which can be as stressful as that would make it 'worse' for everyone. \n\nMy mother has recently found out about this choice and today she mentioned something infront of my husband and I while we were visiting for lunch. She went on a long winded rant about how my husband clearly doesn't want anything to do with me or my baby and how he is so unsupportive. This is entirely untrue as he has emptied his own savings to buy me things to help me around and at my own work while pregnant (I never mentioned these items and have ever even thought about getting them for myself) and he as been there for me through every meltdown about little things along with attending every doctors session / ultrasound. \n\nNear the end of my mothers rant she asked me who would be in the room with me when I would be giving birth. I had chosen husbands mother as she has also been really supportive where she can, my mother blew up at this choice and started saying how I am a horrible daughter and how the baby will die under my care as did my previous through a miscarriage. I saw red as not only is she insulting my husband which already got me extremely upset, but mentioning something like this to me was the tipping point. I started telling her how horrible of a mother she has been, not only through my pregnancy but my entire life (another long topic which I do not want to discuss) and how she cannot insult my husband as he has been nothing but supportive. My dad came home from his friends at this time and tried to resolve the situation by getting my husband and I outside of the house. My father is on my side of the story after he has both heard from my mother, my partner and I about what happened. \n\nMy mother and my sister have been messaging and calling me to know how much of an asshole I was and to apologize and let my mother into the delivery room with me instead of husbands mother.

Do you want that kind of asshole around your child? Not only did she insult you/your husband, and say the baby would die because of you, but weaponized the pain of your miscarriage. Honestly your mother is a monster and a narcissist. Don\u2019t feel bad for putting her in her place. She doesn\u2019t deserve your guilt.  You need to protect yourself, your husband and your future child from that toxic witch. I am so sorry that the one person who should have your back is making your pregnancy a nightmare and hurting you. I am glad that you have a supportive husband and mother in law. Also congratulations on your baby!\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nYour mother wasn't just rude, she was being cruel. Who the hell uses a previous miscarriage as a weapon during a disagreement?! OMG!\n\nDon't engage with your mother, and if your sister knows what your mother did & still supports her, don't engage with her either.  I suggest blocking her after doing something like that and then having the gall to expect *you* to be the one to apologize.", "NTA- First, as someone with anxiety I can definitely understand yours and your husband's agreement. Second, your mom already was an AH for her words about your husband, but then she brings up how the baby will die under your care and mentioning the miscarriage. That's horrible. Your mom and sister are the AH. And honestly, if your mom has done this your whole life, please go either low contact or no contact, as it's not gonna get better.\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy! And I'm glad your husband, MIL and your father are on your side and supportive! Good luck!", "NTA. At least you have a good husband and a supportive MIL. Your mother should not be allowed to be there just because she has demanded it. She and your sister are a disgrace.", "NTA. Someone being family doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re required to keep them in your life. Your mom is abusive, period. You\u2019re well within your right not cut her out of your life completely, your sister as well. They\u2019re both harassing a high risk pregnant person. That\u2019s just crazy", "Nta and don't feel guilty, this was clearly a long time coming. Do not let her into the room. I would honestly cut her out of my life. She's sounds totally toxic.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like you are honestly ok with your plan and comfortable with your MIL in the room, and at the end of the day, it's 100% your call who's in the room with you when you give birth. It's really none of your moms business (and definitely not your sister's) and they don't get a vote. \n\nThat said, it sounds like you better get used to setting boundaries *and* consequences, cause your mom sounds toxic as fuck. Like this wasn't just run-of-the-mill annoyed mom being obnoxious, she said your baby would die. That's like, beyond the pale, and your reaction was definitely not unreasonable (and I'm so sorry for your loss). \n\nYour mom doesn't seem like she's gonna stop. It's going to be on you to protect your kid from the kind of toxicity she brought into your life. Some toxic moms go on to be fantastic grannies, some end up fine if not stellar, some are a disaster. When she shows you which one she's going to be, believe her. The first time.", "NTA. \n\nShe knew what buttons she was pressing when she mentioned that. There's really no come back to that.", "Woah! Definitely NTA and honestly, your mom sounds toxic as fuck! After how she has treated you both and said some very vile things, I\u2019d consider cutting her out of your lives for while! This type of behavior is not ok! Without any kind of real consequence you\u2019re only enabling her to continue. \n\nI\u2019d tell her after a comment like she just made, that will be the reason she does not get to be there for the birth of my child nor have anything to do with our lives until she can get herself help!", "At this point, I would personally be no contact with mother. You don\u2019t need that stress in your pregnancy. Maybe give her another chance when things calm down after the birth, if she shows remorse and you feel like she deserves it. \n\nI would consider the same for your sister. Maybe dad could visit without mom?\n\nNTA", "NTA wow that was really offensive. And please let your hospital/birth centre know she is not to be allowed in.", "NTA You owe NO apologies. Your mother does. Continue with your plans and forget your mother for the time being.", "NTA. Your mother, instead of supporting you, says this. It's horrible.", "nta. don't let that woman anywhere nar your baby. she's going o try to kidnap him. congrats on your baby", "NTA: One thing that I didn\u2019t understand when I was married, and one reason why it failed, is that your spouse is as much a part of your family as anyone else.", ">how the baby will die under my care as did my previous through a miscarriage\n\nThis was all I had to see.\n\nNTA.\n\nThis alone would exclude me from asking her to be in the room with me.", "NTA and its time you got a restraining order against your mother. She is some monster who seems to be more entitled and narcissistic than others with similar nature. She may need her mental health evaluated and some of your anxiety might be from her looking after you from childhood. Go with your choice and make sure your so called mom and sister stayed out of your life for a very long time. Block them and in the strongest language possible, its time to tell them to fork off.", "NTA You and your husband are making the best choices for you and your new family. (Congratulations btw) The birthing time is already stressful for mothers and all advice is to make it stress-free. I even banned certain words, like just, as in you're just 5cm! Whoever is in the room needs to make it about you, and you have chosen the person who'll do that. \nI agree with others that you need to cut your mother out of your life. Your health and wellbeing are the most important thing right now.", "NTA\u2014op, you and your husband are doing what works for you and your relationship, and that is wonderful! It\u2019s great to hear that you both openly communicate about your feelings and determine a route of action that works best for you. \n\nYour mother is definitely out of line, and I think it\u2019s completely fair to feel frustrated, and I completely understand why you snapped at her! You were defending your husband, and rightfully so. If your mother hadn\u2019t snapped about your mother-in-law being in the room (though, I could see why this is potentially hurtful to her, but based off her reaction, I completely understand why you made this decision), I would say perhaps it\u2019s just overt motherly love. Moms care a lot, but your mom doesn\u2019t know your relationship, and her reaction is disrespectful to you and your partner!\n\nCongratulations on your new addition! Your partner seems like a wonderful person, and I wish you and your partner a lifetime of happiness and love!", "NTA. The goal of a support person in the delivery room is to make sure the person delivering the baby stays stress free and has everything they need while they're in such a vulnerable state. Your husband has recognized that he may not be able to handle this, and for your benefit and the baby's, has rightfully opted to stay out of the delivery room. Not only is this decision none of your mother's business, but it also doesn't sound like she'd be a great support person herself. She sounds entitled, and after the horrible things she's said, she should count herself lucky if she ever gets to even meet your baby. Don't feel guilty for protecting your husband and your child from her, you did the right thing and you don't owe her an apology.", "NTA Time to message mom and sister and tell them to stop messaging you. Then block mom and sister and if contact you again don't engage. Don't respond. Don't answer the door, call the police. Document it and use it to get a restraining order.", "NTA You are the one giving birth and you're the one who gets to choose who is in the room with you. The things your mother said were awful... I can understand why you chose MIL. Block you mom and sisters numbers on your cel... it doesn't sound like you need the additional stress the last term of your pregnancy.", "Your mother said something extremely disgusting to you.  Nothing that you could've said to her could compare with what she said to you. Throwing a pregnancy loss in your face was supposed to convince you she is a more supportive person?  What she said would be unforgivable to me. Not only would she not be in the delivery room, she would not be in any room in my house after that either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
