Do you want that kind of asshole around your child? Not only did she insult you/your husband, and say the baby would die because of you, but weaponized the pain of your miscarriage. Honestly your mother is a monster and a narcissist. Don\u2019t feel bad for putting her in her place. She doesn\u2019t deserve your guilt.  You need to protect yourself, your husband and your future child from that toxic witch. I am so sorry that the one person who should have your back is making your pregnancy a nightmare and hurting you. I am glad that you have a supportive husband and mother in law.

I suggest blocking her after doing something like that and then having the gall to expect *you* to be the one to apologize.", "NTA- First, as someone with anxiety I can definitely understand yours and your husband's agreement. Second, your mom already was an AH for her words about your husband, but then she brings up how the baby will die under your care and mentioning the miscarriage. That's horrible. Your mom and sister are the AH. And honestly, if your mom has done this your whole life, please go either low contact or no contact, as it's not gonna get better.\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy! And I'm glad your husband, MIL and your father are on your side and supportive! Good luck!", "NTA. At least you have a good husband and a supportive MIL. Your mother should not be allowed to be there just because she has demanded it. She and your sister are a disgrace.", "NTA. Someone being family doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re required to keep them in your life. Your mom is abusive, period. You\u2019re well within your right to cut her out of your life completely, your sister as well. They\u2019re both harassing a high risk pregnant person.

It's really none of your moms business (and definitely not your sister's) and they don't get a vote. \n\nThat said, it sounds like you better get used to setting boundaries *and* consequences, cause your mom sounds toxic as fuck. Like this wasn't just run-of-the-mill annoyed mom being obnoxious, she said your baby would die. That's like, beyond the pale, and your reaction was definitely not unreasonable (and I'm so sorry for your loss). \n\nYour mom doesn't seem like she's gonna stop. It's going to be on you to protect your kid from the kind of toxicity she brought into your life. Some toxic moms go on to be fantastic grannies, some end up fine if not stellar, some are a disaster. When she shows you which one she's going to be, believe her. The first time.", "NTA. \n\nShe knew what buttons she was pressing when she mentioned that. There's really no come back to that.", "Woah! Definitely NTA and honestly, your mom sounds toxic as fuck! After how she has treated you both and said some very vile things, I\u2019d consider cutting her out of your lives for while! This type of behavior is not ok! Without any kind of real consequence you\u2019re only enabling her to continue. \n\nI\u2019d tell her after a comment like she just made, that will be the reason she does not get to be there for the birth of my child nor have anything to do with our lives until she can get herself help!", "At this point, I would personally be no contact with mother. You don\u2019t need that stress in your pregnancy.

She is some monster who seems to be more entitled and narcissistic than others with similar nature. She may need her mental health evaluated and some of your anxiety might be from her looking after you from childhood. Go with your choice and make sure your so called mom and sister stayed out of your life for a very long time. Block them and in the strongest language possible, its time to tell them to fork off.", "NTA You and your husband are making the best choices for you and your new family. (Congratulations btw) The birthing time is already stressful for mothers and all advice is to make it stress-free. I even banned certain words, like just, as in you're just 5cm! Whoever is in the room needs to make it about you, and you have chosen the person who'll do that. \nI agree with others that you need to cut your mother out of your life. Your health and wellbeing are the most important thing right now.", "NTA\u2014op, you and your husband are doing what works for you and your relationship, and that is wonderful! It\u2019s great to hear that you both openly communicate about your feelings and determine a route of action that works best for you. \n\nYour mother is definitely out of line, and I think it\u2019s completely fair to feel frustrated, and I completely understand why you snapped at her! You were defending your husband, and rightfully so. If your mother hadn\u2019t snapped about your mother-in-law being in the room (though, I could see why this is potentially hurtful to her, but based off her reaction, I completely understand why you made this decision), I would say perhaps it\u2019s just overt motherly love. Moms care a lot, but your mom doesn\u2019t know your relationship, and her reaction is disrespectful to you and your partner!\n\nCongratulations on your new addition! Your partner seems like a wonderful person, and I wish you and your partner a lifetime of happiness and love!", "NTA. The goal of a support person in the delivery room is to make sure the person delivering the baby stays stress free and has everything they need while they're in such a vulnerable state. Your husband has recognized that he may not be able to handle this, and for your benefit and the baby's, has rightfully opted to stay out of the delivery room. Not only is this decision none of your mother's business, but it also doesn't sound like she'd be a great support person herself. She sounds entitled, and after the horrible things she's said, she should count herself lucky if she ever gets to even meet your baby. Don't feel guilty for protecting your husband and your child from her, you did the right thing and you don't owe her an apology.", "NTA Time to message mom and sister and tell them to stop messaging you. Then block mom and sister and if contact you again don't engage. Don't respond. Don't answer the door, call the police. Document it and use it to get a restraining order.", "NTA You are the one giving birth and you're the one who gets to choose who is in the room with you. The things your mother said were awful... I can understand why you chose MIL. Block you mom and sisters numbers on your cel... it doesn't sound like you need the additional stress the last term of your pregnancy.", "Your mother said something extremely disgusting to you.  Nothing that you could've said to her could compare with what she said to you. Throwing a pregnancy loss in your face was supposed to convince you she is a more supportive person?  What she said would be unforgivable to me. Not only would she not be in the delivery room, she would not be in any room in my house after that either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can be your support person after the delivery. Do not call your mother when you go into labor or after the baby is born. Wait until you feel ready and set up strong boundaries.
