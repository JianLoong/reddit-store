My coworker E has just came back from maternity leave and so far has had all her schedule change requests approved, even if I didn\u2019t get a say in my shift being switched. \n\nE sent me a text the other day asking me to switch a few days this month, which would have me go from working at 10am to working at 2pm. Normally I\u2019m okay with working that shift, but I have a 7am shift the following day and my boss won\u2019t allow us to work shifts that close together. I\u2019m also not willing to give up the 7am as that\u2019s my work Friday and it gives me more time to do homework. (I spend my weekends doing all my homework since I work and go to school full time.)\n\nI told her I could work one of the three shifts because I have the next day off and I\u2019d be able to make that work better, but the other two I\u2019d have to decline. I thought that would be the end of it, but it turns out that E went to our boss and said she needed those days for her daycare schedule and our boss switched all 5 days for the month so E can work days and I\u2019m working swing. \n\nWhen I came into work I was immediately upset when seeing the schedule change and asked my boss if I could speak to her privately. When I told her it wasn\u2019t okay that E asked me to switch and I declined, but she had the days changed anyway. My boss responded with, \u201cWell do you have anything planned on those days?\u201d And said no, but tried to explain why I like the days shift on my Fridays. She then asked me point blank if I\u2019m refusing to switch and I said yes. She said she would switch them back for me when she gets back from vacation. \n\nI\u2019m a kind person, almost to a fault, and if she had said she needed to switch for daycare I probably would have guilted myself into switching, but after she went behind my back I refuse to help her. AITA?\n\n\nEdit to add some info for your questions:\n\nYes, there are a couple others who could have switched her instead of me, but they\u2019ve been there for 5+ years so their schedules never change. Mine is the one that seems to change every month, then get adjusted to accommodate other people\u2019s schedules. (I had all days off for May until my other coworker H needed them for her kids, then I got switched to swing. The 5 days E was given were my only day shifts left.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened because of E and while I can\u2019t assume she did it maliciously, I had a gut feeling that this would happen and checked my schedule when I first got to work on my Monday. I was previously told about an incident involving E at work that made me question her character as it was a huge violation of HIPAA (we work in healthcare), just to give context as to why I was uneasy in the first place. \n\nI had a day just last week where I came in at 7am, only to have my boss tell me that she forgot to let me know she switched me to the 10am so E could get off in time for her son\u2019s baseball game. It turns out E meant another day and another coworker, but the fact that I wasn\u2019t told at all really sucked. \n\nAlso, working full time and going to school full time is really hard when I can\u2019t have a set schedule. I\u2019m taking all online classes this semester, but next semester I have in-person classes so this will be even more difficult for me. My days off are easiest for homework because it\u2019s the last month of the semester and so my coursework is heavier and more time-consuming.\n\nMy boss is usually really nice and understanding, but I can definitely tell that she adores E and her new baby. I can\u2019t afford to get another job right now as I make pretty good money right now and in order to cover all my bills I\u2019d need to find a job with the same pay. I\u2019ll definitely take your advice and keep an eye out for jobs that pay the same in the meantime though.", "created_utc": 1682758442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132nrgk/aita_for_not_switching_shifts_with_my_coworker/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe what you \"have on\" is sitting on the couch and watching TV.

She has a kid, it's not something she needs to keep secret that this is the reason she needs a swap. Then going behind your back and giving the actual reasons for the swap to your boss to force it to happen was a sucky move.\n\nYour boss sucks for not planning better with someone returning from maternity. It is very rarely as simple as you just put them back into the rota how you did before. Also, their attitude about whether you had plans or not isn't professional and their communication on changes is awful.\n\nYou suck a tiny bit as childcare is pretty legit reason for needing to switch and you've probably made her life harder than it needs to be when you have no time-bound plans. However, this depends on your views on moral obligations and I am not saying this is your responsibility to fix, just that it would've been a kind thing to do.\n\nAll in all this just seems a clusterf\\*ck of terrible communication, management and planning", "NAH - what's E supposed to do? She can't get childcare for when her shifts are, she tries to swap them but it doesn't work, so she goes to her manager. Obviously we don't know how or what was said, but it could have been: I can't work those shifts you've given me as I don't have childcare, I tried to swap them but still have two left, please can you help. All of which is totally reasonable. Characterising it as 'going behind OP's back' is a bit unfair.  \n\nThen the manager needs to sort that out. They look at the shifts that are possible and swap them. If anyone is the slightest AH here it's the manager for not proactively having a proper conversation with E about what she can do now and setting the rota accordingly. Though that wouldn't have helped OP out, as OP still would have lost their preferred shift.\n\nI also don't think OP is the AH for not wanting to swap shifts for ones that work best for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not sorry.", "As former manager, I would suggest the following approach. \n\nYou will probably not win in the long run by taking an inflexible stand. I totally agree that having a majority of the workers with schedules etched in stone is unfair, but you will not be able to challenge that. At least not at first. \n\nDecide what your scheduling requirements are. Your work Friday 7am start time. One weekend day off each week, etc. Decide which ones are inflexible and which ones are sort of flexible and then the rest being flexible enough that you are ok with being changed. Is there a limit on the number of changes that you will accept per week/month?\n\nHave a sit-down discussion with your boss at a time that there are no schedule changes on the table. Negotiate from what they want, apparently total flexibility on your part and little notice on theirs, against what you want.\n\nNote that she should not be able to violate her rules. A 7am shift following a 2pm shift is her, or a company, work rule.\n\nFailure to inform you of a shift change is her problem and not yours. \n\nYou obviously are willing to entertain a shift change to accommodate emergencies, but non-emergencies like a kid's baseball game require your agreement before your schedule can be changed.\n\nBe prepared for pushback. Your response to most of it should be \"why not?\" \n\nI can't ask H to work a weekend shift? Why not?\n\nThere is a huge amount of lack of respect that is taking place here. \n\nChanging your schedule arbitrarily without asking takes away any control that you have over your personal life. \n\nChanging your schedule for a non-critical reason says that your time and activities have no value compared to your coworkers.\n\nFailing to tell you of a schedule change at any time is seriously rude as well as disrespectful.\n\nYour boss needs to come away from the meeting with the impression that you will be flexible as long as flexibility is extended to you. That are deserving of respect and will not be a door mat.", "\"of course I have plans. I planned to have the day off.\"", "Or tell your boss that whether or not you have plans is irrelevant to the discussion.", "For sure but some people are uncomfortable with saying no or confrontation. So those people need to almost practice and be prepared to answer.", "As someone who has worked shifts, you might try always working swing shift.That way you will not have adjust and can better plan your time.\nNTA"]}
