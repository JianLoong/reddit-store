Normally I\u2019m okay with working that shift, but I have a 7am shift the following day and my boss won\u2019t allow us to work shifts that close together. I\u2019m also not willing to give up the 7am as that\u2019s my work Friday and it gives me more time to do homework. (I spend my weekends doing all my homework since I work and go to school full time.)\n\nI told her I could work one of the three shifts because I have the next day off and I\u2019d be able to make that work better, but the other two I\u2019d have to decline. I thought that would be the end of it, but it turns out that E went to our boss and said she needed those days for her daycare schedule and our boss switched all 5 days for the month so E can work days and I\u2019m working swing. \n\nWhen I came into work I was immediately upset when seeing the schedule change and asked my boss if I could speak to her privately. When I told her it wasn\u2019t okay that E asked me to switch and I declined, but she had the days changed anyway. My boss responded with, \u201cWell do you have anything planned on those days?\u201d And said no, but tried to explain why I like the days shift on my Fridays. She then asked me point blank if I\u2019m refusing to switch and I said yes. She said she would switch them back for me when she gets back from vacation. \n\nI\u2019m a kind person, almost to a fault, and if she had said she needed to switch for daycare I probably would have guilted myself into switching, but after she went behind my back I refuse to help her.

But I'm curious if your coworker really is the problem considering how your boss acts... Are you sure E asked to change schedules with you specifically, regardless of what you said or did your boss just offhandedly change the shifts the same way she now wants to change them back? \n\nI'm also interested in the office culture. Are you the only one who's being asked to switch shifts? Why didn't ask E someone else to switch for the shift you couldn't switch.", "In the future if your boss asks if you have plans, say yes. \nYour plan could be sleeping in, or bingeing a show.  Doesn\u2019t matter. \nWork is not your life. \nYou are NTA", "GTFO of this super toxic work environment!!! Your bosses behavior and enabling is not okay. Time to start applying to other jobs.", "NTA. You are unable to switch those shifts.  Just because someone else has a baby doesn't mean your life revolves around them.  I would have a quiet word with your boss about this.  it is not healthy finishing at 10pm and starting at 7am and could go against company guidelines.", "NTA.\n\nE and your boss both suck and they are TAs here. E shouldn't have gone behind your back and lied and boss should have confirmed with you first.\n\nYou don't need to \"have something on\" to justify not having to rearrange your life for somebody else. Maybe what you \"have on\" is sitting on the couch and watching TV. I hate this idea that people without kids have to jump to accommodate parents all the time and that nothing in their life is important enough to trump child-caring stuff.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, keeping your Friday shift where you want it is absolutely the hill to die on.", "NTA. You said no, and she decided to ignore you.", "NTA\u2026 your boss sucks. Not you for refusing to switch shifts and not E for trying to sure up her schedule for childcare.  \n\nBut your boss blindly switching shifts around and not consulting with you and then asking if you even have anything to do those days like it\u2019s any of her fucking business what you do when not in office\u2026. nah bro.", "Next time say yes you do have plans.

It is not clear whether the boss had an either/or between OP and the co-worker's shifts, or whether there were other colleagues who could have been asked to switch. Similarly, its not clear whether the co-worker complained about the shift thinking someone else could swap instead of OP.  \n\nI'm inclined to NTA, but it could be a NAH if the manager thought they had no option & OP wouldn't mind and the co-worker didn't realise that OP would be the one made to change after OP had already said No.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for not being more clear on her reasons for the request in the first place. She has a kid, it's not something she needs to keep secret that this is the reason she needs a swap. Then going behind your back and giving the actual reasons for the swap to your boss to force it to happen was a sucky move.\n\nYour boss sucks for not planning better with someone returning from maternity. It is very rarely as simple as you just put them back into the rota how you did before. Also, their attitude about whether you had plans or not isn't professional and their communication on changes is awful.\n\nYou suck a tiny bit as childcare is pretty legit reason for needing to switch and you've probably made her life harder than it needs to be when you have no time-bound plans. However, this depends on your views on moral obligations and I am not saying this is your responsibility to fix, just that it would've been a kind thing to do.\n\nAll in all this just seems a clusterf\\*ck of terrible communication, management and planning", "NAH - what's E supposed to do? She can't get childcare for when her shifts are, she tries to swap them but it doesn't work, so she goes to her manager. Obviously we don't know how or what was said, but it could have been: I can't work those shifts you've given me as I don't have childcare, I tried to swap them but still have two left, please can you help. All of which is totally reasonable. Characterising it as 'going behind OP's back' is a bit unfair.  \n\nThen the manager needs to sort that out. They look at the shifts that are possible and swap them. If anyone is the slightest AH here it's the manager for not proactively having a proper conversation with E about what she can do now and setting the rota accordingly. Though that wouldn't have helped OP out, as OP still would have lost their preferred shift.\n\nI also don't think OP is the AH for not wanting to swap shifts for ones that work best for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you positive she went behind your back?

Besides that, OP *is* agreeing to some switches *when they work for OP*. Shift switching is NEVER an obligation. Pretty astounded at your audacity in shaming OP for prioritizing their own life instead of a random coworker's.", "Why is OP responsible for making E's childcare schedule work? OP doesn't suck for having her own priorities outside of work. That doesn't get trumped just because it doesn't involve a kid.", "Maybe E needs to find a job that aligns with her childcare instead of trying to make it someone else's problem. Occasionally switching is one thing, but it sounds like E is going to need to reschedule shifts on a regular basis.", "Exactly. I don\u2019t mind switching to do a coworker a favor, as there are times I need to switch. \nBut my job is not entitled to my free time. \nI don\u2019t get stuck in a drawer when I leave work, just waiting until I can go work again.", "Yep. \u201cPlans\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be tickets to somewhere or arrangements with friends. \nPlans could be a soak in the tub or doing absolutely nothing. \nDon\u2019t feel guilty OP!!", "Whilst I agree with that point, I was asking because if there was one or more other colleague who might have been able to switch then it is even more unfair that the colleague and the manager were wanting OP to switch instead of anyone else.", "I am not saying it's OP's problem or responsibility.

All ways she's losing money or possibly her livelihood entirely.\n\nAgain, none of these are OP's problem or responsibility beyond a moral obligation we have to each other as human beings living in society. In a better country the state would be there to help or the company would be legally required to make accommodations but that doesn't appear to be the case across the states.\n\nThe employer would be doing all these things in a reasonable country, ensuring all these accommodations are made, but that doesn't appear to be the way the US system works and it's left to workers to help each other.", "I'm not saying it's her responsibility, I'm saying that childcare is harder to sort/move around than OP's plans (which they state were doing homework that can presumably be done any hours during the day) so being kind on this occasion wouldn't have ruined her plans.\n\nThe whole scenario highlights some serious failings with the organisation and how they accommodate people returning from maternity, but I'm writing from a country where these rights are enshrined in law and the employer's actions in this case would be classed as discriminatory against OP's colleague.", "E chose to have a child knowing that they had a variable work schedule.
