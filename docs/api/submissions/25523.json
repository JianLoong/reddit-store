{"id": 25523, "submission_id": "161l35w", "title": "AITA for changing my wifi password/locking out the students in the next apartment?", "selftext": "\rI received a notice from my internet provider that says someone illegally downloaded a movie or a game (WB Harry Potter claim so could be either I think) from my IP. In that email they suggested changing the wifi password and not to share it and I did just that.\r  \n\r  \nThe next day three young men from the next door apartment come over and ask for the wifi password. Seems they are in summer courses and not having internet will be a big problem for them.\r  \n\r  \nI have only had negative interactions with these people for noise complaints and blocking my car which they did regularly until I started having them towed.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t know they were using my wifi. They certainly didn\u2019t ask permission. I pay for unlimited high speed so it doesn\u2019t cost me anything to share it. If we got along ok I actually would be open to letting them use it but not for illegal downloading. \r  \n\r  \nI said no. They\u2019re moving out in 4 days and can\u2019t get internet installed just for that.\r  \n\r  \nThey stole my internet for four months when they should have all chipped in for their own. Anyhow I\u2019m apparently the villain and am wondering if I should have just let them use it for four more days?\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: I changed my wifi after a copyright notice and the neighbors are upset they can\u2019t steal it right before final exams.", "created_utc": 1693024093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161l35w/aita_for_changing_my_wifi_passwordlocking_out_the/", "score": 375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole. Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n > I was a grad student not that long ago and I can relate to the struggle of coursework and not having a lot of money.\nIf I deprive them of internet access at home that means they will have to go somewhere with free wifi.  One of them said they had a project that was due and the others said they had to study for finals.  The ability to do those things without internet access will be diminished.\nSo I could let them steal my internet at no cost at all to me and help them or put my foot down and put them in a bad spot.  \nThey are moving out in 4 days so the problem is resolved either way.  I feel bad for doing it.  Some of my friends said I should have just let them use it but promise to not download anything that is copyrighted.  \nI feel conflicted about my decision.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
