Seems they are in summer courses and not having internet will be a big problem for them.\r  \n\r  \nI have only had negative interactions with these people for noise complaints and blocking my car which they did regularly until I started having them towed.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t know they were using my wifi.

They\u2019re moving out in 4 days and can\u2019t get internet installed just for that.\r  \n\r  \nThey stole my internet for four months when they should have all chipped in for their own.

One of them said they had a project that was due and the others said they had to study for finals.  The ability to do those things without internet access will be diminished.\nSo I could let them steal my internet at no cost at all to me and help them or put my foot down and put them in a bad spot.  \nThey are moving out in 4 days so the problem is resolved either way.  I feel bad for doing it.
