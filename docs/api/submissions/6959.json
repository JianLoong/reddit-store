It's understandable for you to be upset about your uncle going against your mother's wishes, but everyone grieves in their own way. It would've been best to compromise. If he just needed a minute or two, that could potentially have been fine, so long as the lid went right back on and the funeral could've continued as normal. It's the last time your uncle would've seen his sister, after all. It's hard for everyone: you, your dad, your uncle and the rest of your family. It's important to respect the dead for sure, but we can't forget to take care of the living.

I read a few years ago that a very high percentage of twins (like 35%-40% or so) die within a few months of each other as the surviving twin is completely distraught without them.   Their bodies simply give up and they die of natural causes (heart attacks and strokes were the top causes).  That is a bond only twins can understand.\n\nYour uncle has literally not lived one moment without his sister (your mom); they were conceived together, they shared a womb together, they hit every single milestone together.

Yours is one that most children someday have to go through and we can all better understand that pain. I know, I lost my mom a few years ago. \n\nThe fact he said sorry to her, means he understands very well that what he did was wrong. We can all make mistakes, especially when we grief. You are both NTA. You are both grieving and you are both human beings. You both have a lot of emotions now and you both need to give that a place. \n\nDon't hold his grieving mistake against him for the rest of his life. This was a true mistake, that happened because of grief. He was not being malicious or spiteful. \n\nIn the future you can have a civilised conversation with him. When you both aren't raw with grief. You don't have to apologise, just tell him you were grieving and angry he wasn't upholding your mother's wishes causing your father more pain. I wouldn't be surprised if he apologises to you, saying what he did was wrong and all he wanted was to see her one more time. He should have handled it differently, but in his pain and grief he made the wrong choice. \n\nYou can then both leave this in the past and move on. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss and I'm sending you strength for these difficult times\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nIt was one of her final wishes!\n\nWho the hell opens a closed casket at a funeral?!\n\nYou didn't cause a scene, he did.", "I'd have kn*cked him out, never mind shouted at him.

The immediate family had some time with the open casket prior to the service, and the mortician closed and locked the lid prior to the service.  Visitation was closed the entire time.

Funerals are so tricky because they are for the people/community grieving as well as for the person who has passed. Depending on your culture, there may be certain things that help people process that death, including viewing the body. Obviously you want to respect the wishes of the person who died, especially when they were so clearly laid out, but it can be very complicated when those don\u2019t mesh with how people grieve them.

Seriously my first middle eastern funeral was quite the shock.  I get the vibe that OPs Uncle is from a generation/place with different cultural norms than the OP.  Seems like OPs mother wanted the closed coffin but bro couldn\u2019t handle that.  Yeah it was some crazy extreme stuff pulling the coffin top off, but I give people a lot of slack when they are processing trauma, like the death of their twin.

He was being an enormous asshole. He probably thought he could trample all over your moms wishes and no one would stop him because of fear of \u201cmaking a scene\u201d.
