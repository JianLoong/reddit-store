It's also important to remember that you are going through a very difficult time and it's important to take care of yourself and your emotional well-being.

I hope the yelling felt a little therapeutic. I\u2019m thinking of you and your family.", "YTA. Before anything, I'm sorry for your loss. It's understandable for you to be upset about your uncle going against your mother's wishes, but everyone grieves in their own way. It would've been best to compromise. If he just needed a minute or two, that could potentially have been fine, so long as the lid went right back on and the funeral could've continued as normal. It's the last time your uncle would've seen his sister, after all. It's hard for everyone: you, your dad, your uncle and the rest of your family. It's important to respect the dead for sure, but we can't forget to take care of the living. If a few more minutes seeing his sister is going to help him through the grieving process, I would have talked to the other family members and asked how they felt about it, but making a scene out of it is never the right move.", "ESH\n\nI understand why you're upset, but also. Your uncle though... The man just lost his sister, and you're not being empathetic at all. Sounds like he wanted to see her one last time before the burial.\n\nI don't know if this was on his own or in front of people, BUT if it was just on his own, he's DEF not the AHole because he's family and it's more than reasonable that he's grieving in his own way as well and might have wanted to see her.", "NAH. People do crazy things when they are grieving.  I\u2019m so sorry about your Mom.  Your Uncle behaved badly, but he was clearly hurting and just dealing with it in his own way.  He knew he was breaking his sister\u2019s wishes, but still couldn\u2019t stop himself from needing to see her one last time.  And of course you yelled.  Your Mom had just died!  You are probably in so much pain and just trying to do right by her.  Grief can rip families apart, please cut each other some slack as you all move through this terrible time.  I hope you find comfort in your loved ones abs not more pain.", "[removed]", "NTA - your mom finally wishes ffs. It isn't that hard to let the lid closed.

My sister explained that part to me cos she\u2019s a twin aswell and they have some sort of connection I don\u2019t understand how it works. I had said to her that it wasn\u2019t right of him to do so without asking esp in front of everyone considering the wishes .. maybe I am kind of the AH, but in retrospect I wouldn\u2019t want someone to dishonour my final wishes idk hearing everyone\u2019s pov makes me think", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.  You were understandably upset at what happened but please don\u2019t be too hard on your uncle.\n\nYou mentioned your mom and uncle were twins and that can be a incredibly strong bond.  I read a few years ago that a very high percentage of twins (like 35%-40% or so) die within a few months of each other as the surviving twin is completely distraught without them.   Their bodies simply give up and they die of natural causes (heart attacks and strokes were the top causes).  That is a bond only twins can understand.\n\nYour uncle has literally not lived one moment without his sister (your mom); they were conceived together, they shared a womb together, they hit every single milestone together.  The reality setting in that he is now alone overcame him and he needed to see her one last time.  Was it right?  No.  Was it understandable?  Absolutely.", "NTA.   I would have done the same.   YOU didn't cause the scene ... HE did!", "NTA. You're grieving and still have the presence of mind to uphold your mother's wishes. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.

Tell sis next time to unite with you when stuff like this happens.", "NTA. You\u2019re grieving. Your uncle is, too, but that doesn\u2019t excuse him for going against the express wishes of your Mum. He should\u2019ve have respected her request. And if I\u2019d been in your shoes, watching my dad break down on such a painful day, I\u2019d have told him off, too.\n\nI\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.", "NTA NTA NTA!!! You should be so proud of yourself for standing up for both your mom and your father. Uncle was WAY out of line and IMO should have been kicked out for that kind of behaviour, you did nothing wrong and you didn't cause a scene. I'm so sorry about your loss <3", "NTA. Your Uncle ignored your mum's clear final wishes. He is a jerk. You are well within your rights to tell at him in this case", "All that is important here is that you both grief the upcoming days and weeks. Your uncle's pain is one that most of us will never understand, seeing as most of us aren't twins. Yours is one that most children someday have to go through and we can all better understand that pain. I know, I lost my mom a few years ago. \n\nThe fact he said sorry to her, means he understands very well that what he did was wrong. We can all make mistakes, especially when we grief. You are both NTA. You are both grieving and you are both human beings. You both have a lot of emotions now and you both need to give that a place. \n\nDon't hold his grieving mistake against him for the rest of his life. This was a true mistake, that happened because of grief. He was not being malicious or spiteful. \n\nIn the future you can have a civilised conversation with him. When you both aren't raw with grief. You don't have to apologise, just tell him you were grieving and angry he wasn't upholding your mother's wishes causing your father more pain. I wouldn't be surprised if he apologises to you, saying what he did was wrong and all he wanted was to see her one more time. He should have handled it differently, but in his pain and grief he made the wrong choice. \n\nYou can then both leave this in the past and move on. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss and I'm sending you strength for these difficult times\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nIt was one of her final wishes!\n\nWho the hell opens a closed casket at a funeral?!\n\nYou didn't cause a scene, he did.", "I'd have kn*cked him out, never mind shouted at him.

Maybe could have been a little quieter about it. But I understand it was probably a bit of chaos and you just wanted him to stop. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to your family.", "NTA. It really was a simple wish, too. So disrespectful to your mum what they did.", "NTA. Clearly there WAS the need for a big scene in order to stop the even bigger scene of your uncle removing the top of the casket. I mean seriously WTF? What kind of person would do that?

Her brother gets relegated and his wishes do not trump hers.\n\nPlease accept my sympathy for the loss of your mother", "NTA\n\nYour uncle is 100% TA for several reasons.\nHe couldn't or wouldn't respect your mom's, his twins,  final wish for a closed casket. \nHe made your already devastated father cry.\nHe made your father feel like he failed your mother's last request.\nHe made a scene at your mother's funeral/viewing.\nI think you did the right thing for calling him out in the moment and stood up.for not only your mother but your father as well.\n\nGood job taking care of both of your parents at a painful time in your life.", "NTA.

You were not wrong for yelling at your Uncle and protecting your mum and dad in that moment. I can\u2019t see your Uncle as an AH though, yes he was wrong to do what he did, but he wasn\u2019t just your mum\u2019s brother, he was her twin. That\u2019s also a level of grief that we may not understand, and so I think some grace should be extended to him acting senseless due to grief.

Mine would've been way worse.  \n  \nI'm sorry for your loss", "It deserved a scene. \n\nYour mother left specific instructions for the casket to stay closed. If your uncle wanted to see her one last time the respectful thing to do was ask your dad before or after when nobody else was around. He didn\u2019t. Why? He wanted to make a show of it which is disrespectful to your mother and your entire family.\n\nEverybody always blames the outburst as \u201cuncomfortable\u201d instead of addressing the person who caused the issue.

Few of the people expected to run the thing are in a right state of mind.   Your uncle is TA, as he shouldn't've disrespected your mum's wishes, but gently because fuck, you're all going through the wringer right now.  I don't blame you for shouting at all.
