That's none of your business.", "NTA", "NTA K on the other hand is.", "NAH\n\nThis is just an unfortunate coincidental misunderstanding.  They probably should have asked you about it first but really, it's understandable that they would have believed that a divorce is a divorce and would have felt a duty to help your wife, because in all fairness, divorces are often battles.", "NTA\n\nYou and your wife have a cute inside joke. K stuck their nose in where it didn\u2019t belong and now they\u2019re probably too embarrassed to admit they were wrong. Plus extra embarrassed because they *spread gossip around* that was blatantly false. Why tf did they do that instead of going straight to your wife?? How is that protecting her? I can see why your wife wants to think that to smooth things over, but this is still 100% on K. If they\u2019re embarrassed, they have no one to blame but themself.", "Don\u2019t really think anybody\u2019s the AH here. She was protecting her friend - which is where her loyalty should lay. You weren\u2019t doing anything bad either.\n\nI\u2019d say she was probably right to pick it up with your wife if she was concerned.", "Split on this looking at it front both sides. OP and his wife have a beautiful interpersonal thing going on and it\u2019s cute, but on the other hand the friend was probably mortified and scared to present what she saw to OP by her self as she might get singled out. Normally most people would want to know if their spouse had plans of divorce. While spreading this information to everyone was wrong i don\u2019t blame the friend looking out for op\u2019s wife just everything was misleading. I don\u2019t think anyone is to blame just a simple misunderstanding to a interpersonal relationship.", "NTA. I like that this friend thinks that someone actually planning to divorce their partner would set \"prepare for divorce\" as their reminder. Like people just intermittently forget about their crumbling marriage.", "NTA\n\nBut could you imagine the kind of A\\*\\* that would send himself a memo to remind him to divorce his wife! Yikes!!", "Nta. It's so weird that people feel like it's okay to snoop in people's phones and private business.", "ESH. IMO, K should have approached wife quietly first rather than telling everyone to gather support as she doesn't know how the wife would want to handle the news. However OP is taking this far too personally. If you don't want people to see your reminders, don't leave your phone lying on the table where everyone can see it. K wasn't snooping through your phone, you left it in full sight of everyone. It is perfectly understandable why she misunderstood. Be happy your wife has loyal friends who watch her back. That is a good thing. I don't think K should have to  apologise for seeing it on your phone and misunderstanding. She should be relieved to be wrong though and not doubling down on that.", "NTA", "NTA. If K is your wife\u2019s friend, I understand why she told your wife what she saw. However\u2026once she knew about the inside joke between you and your wife, she absolutely should have apologized!!! It\u2019s amazing to me how many people have such hang ups about apologizing when they\u2019re wrong.", "She may have been asking others if she should say something or that it was none of her business. HOWEVER, get outta people's phones! Somebody is way to nosey.", ">There was no \"protection \" in spreading your personal situation to everyone you knew, she was wanting to spread gossip, period. \n\nBOOM - there it is.  Protection my ass - she wanted some salacious gossip.", "I disagree. Dont downplay \u201csilly\u201d. Silly things can be just as important and serious things. If anything, silly things are what makes our relationships special and unique. I mean, how many partners provide love and support to their significant others?  Lots even if not enough. How many pretend to get divorced just to get married again?  Certainly not many if any at all. Embrace the silly.", "If she saw the reminber without intention and wanted to do something about it, she should not have spread the news.", "Fair point, but I guess my main point is she\u2019s not the asshole for not talking to HIM about it. She shouldn\u2019t have told the friends, but that\u2019s not what the question\u2019s about\u2014just an ahole detail", "I misread that part. You\u2019re right.", "Your friend? Sure maybe. Everybody else? Absolutely not. Getting mad at the SO for putting personal stuff on his personal phone? No way", "Huh?", "Ummmm - only if you do it wrong. Syncing calendars into a common widget on your phone and IMPORTING THE CALENDAR are two very different functions.", "Exactly. I would find a private time to \u201cbreak the news\u201d to my friend, offer my support, etc. I\u2019d keep that between us instead of spreading it around. She was a bad friend to OP\u2019s wife.", "K says the notification popped up while he was gone, and his phone was in a place where she could see it.\n\nGlancing at a phone making a notification noise is pretty normal behavior - and doing a double take when you see \u201cdivorce\u201d is pretty normal, too.", "Depends what kind of friends they are? I have three close friends, if the other two were there I would ask them what to do etc. If you can't trust your friends, why are you friends with them in the first place.", "Fair, but I don't think he's mad that K didn't talk to him specifically about it. He seems to want to know if he's TA for being upset that she didn't clarify that situation first before spreading it all around. While I agree she shouldn't have spoken to him about it, I do think she was TA for not just speaking to OP's wife about what she saw and clarifying that way. I could be reading his question wrong though.", "See, that\u2019s what I thought. But everyone at work I talked to had the same problem. I guess we are all just idiots. Oh god. Now I feel old"]}
