This is something between you two that you both understand, love and respect. Don't call it \"silly\" and downplay it, this is YOURS, and what others think is irrelevant. \n\nSecond, she should have spoken to you or your wife if she was so concerned, not spread it around everyone like a high-schooler dishing the latest gossip on who slept with whom. That was beyond childish. There was no \"protection \" in spreading your personal situation to everyone you knew, she was wanting to spread gossip, period. Your wife needs to understand that too. \n\nThird, which basically makes point 2 irrelevant but it is what it is; she shouldn't have been looking at your phone, full stop. Again, nosey gossiper.\n\nKeep information away from her.", "NTA \n\nI understand noticing the pop-up message because the screen gets bright at that precise moment even if the mobile is locked. \n\nThe part where K told all of their friends(and not just OP\u2019s wife) about the pop-up message makes her an a%#. And that\u2019s why K needs to apologize.", "NTA\n\nWhat right did K have for looking at your phone in the first place?  If she had concerns, she should have approached you first, not ran and tattled to your wife in an attempt to create some kind of drama.", "NTA. \n\n>K thinks that I'm an idiot for having something like that on my phone, and is refusing to apologise.\n\nShe looked at your phone then told a lot of other people what she saw...but somehow you are to blame? Not at all.", "NTA\nIn what universe is it okay to look at someone else's phone, even if accidentally, and then not apologise?\n\nWas K snooping?\nWe don't know. She could have just caught it without intending to.\n\nWas K wrong for telling your wife?\nMaybe not. The case can be made that she genuinely thought she should look out for her friend and that she couldn't keep silent about it.\n\nWas K wrong for telling everyone else?\nHell yes.\nTelling your wife was only acceptable because she genuinely felt she was looking out for her, in which case, yes, tell the person affected. If she'd done that, your wife would have immediately cleared up the confusion and there would have been little embarrassment.\n\nInstead, K chose to tell everyone about this juicy scoop. And now she's embarrassed that she got it wrong. \n\nAnd for the record, there can be a number of reasons why you'd have that on your phone, an in-joke between you and your spouse being just one. You could have been preparing for someone else's divorce. And the she'd have outed that to the world. \n\nShe made an ass out of herself and she knows it. That's why she's salty.", "NTA, not your fault that they looked.", "NTA. Where is the \u201cprotection\u201d of your wife\u2019s feelings by telling a bunch of people before even telling your wife? If she was really down for your wife, she would have told her privately. Snoopy, gossipy behavior. Embarrassing.", "NTA, but K on the other hand should be an acquaintance moving forward. Oddly she shared this with others prior to your wife or you. She may be a snake in the grass and secretly plotting on your downfall. This situation exposed her intentions, not everyone is to be trusted.", "NTA, she was putting her nose where it did not belong.", "NAH. You\u2019re not at fault for a harmless joke, and it seems like a sweet tradition you two have. \n\nI also don\u2019t blame the friend in this. It\u2019s understandable to want privacy, but if a notification pops up on a phone lying on the table, people will see it - either because they think it\u2019s their own phone or just because it catches the attention. If you do not want a notification to be read by anyone, keep your phone with you, put it on the table screen side down, or set notifications to where it doesn\u2019t show the contents of the notification.\n\nI can also understand her telling friends and your wife first. I\u2019d also be concerned and wanting to ask friends for advice. She\u2019s primarily your wife\u2019s friend, and something like this could have major consequences if it were actually serious and she didn\u2019t tell your wife. This includes talking to you first - if it were serious this might have exacerbated the situation and would essentially be her going behind her friends back. I\u2019m thinking she meant well, and wanted to protect her friend.\n\nI hope you and her can mend things. Neither of you seem like bad people, or like you had bad intentions, and she should be happy you and your wife have such a good relationship and you should be happy your wife has loyal friends that have her back.", "NTA\n\nEven in the imaginary alternative reality where you actually were getting a divorce, she has no right to be involving herself in such a matter and then also telling others about it.", "NTA.  K violated your privacy and then, rather than confront you, blabbed to everyone  - but you!

If she actually went in your phone, that would be terrible but if it popped up while your phone was face up on the table and the sudden lighting up of the screen grabbed her attention, it\u2019s sort of like an instinctual reaction to glance down. Kind of like visual equivalent of overhearing a conversation. Don\u2019t leave your phone face up in the future I guess.\n\nMy SO and I joke about divorce all the time so I get it. Weird to put it in your phone but you do you I guess. Commitment to the bit. \n\nBut yeah, I think it\u2019s actually nice of K to stick up for your wife so much.

And if the friend had believed that the information was only pertinent to OP and not her friend, then I\u2019d agree with you that sharing it makes her an asshole automatically. That\u2019s not the case though, she clearly believed the information was perhaps even more significant for her friend than for OP, as she suspected he might have kept a very important and nasty secret from her. She thought OP was *secretly planning to divorce her friend*, so I understand why she wouldn\u2019t be keeping that secret for OP\u2019s sake. \n\nHonestly, this all sounds very immature and like it could be fixed easily by adult communication and mutual understanding.", "Fair enough, a dick move without evil intentions is still a dick move"]}
