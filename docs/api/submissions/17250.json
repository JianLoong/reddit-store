His college is a few hours from where I live, but this weekend, he came to visit with his girlfriend in honor of Mother's Day. It was my first time meeting his girlfriend, who he met doing college extracurriculars. \n\nHis girlfriend (19F) is a lovely girl, but very eccentric. She was very shy and quiet when my son introduced us, even though I did my best to welcome her into our home. Even when we had begun talking and everyone was more relaxed, she still seemed on edge. \n\nThe conflict came when we sat down for Mother's Day lunch. My husband said grace, as he always does, but my son's girlfriend acted like she didn't care at all. She just looked at us as we all bowed our heads, and even when my son indicated she should do the same, she didn't. \n\nAfter my husband finished, I asked why she didn't show any respect for the prayer. She again looked uncomfortable, and said she didn't grow up Christian and doesn't really know the proper manners for prayers and such. \n\nI thought this was a terrible excuse, but kept quiet as to not ruin lunch. Afterwards, when my son and his girlfriend were getting ready to go, I pulled him aside and said that next time, he should bring over a girl with better manners. \n\nMy son was furious at me, and said that next time he plans to bring the same girl, and if I don't like that there won't be a next time at all. I tried to say that he's only 19 and it's very unlikely this relationship is forever, but he didn't want to hear it. He and his girlfriend left, and the last thing I heard her say was her asking him why he was so angry. He's probably told her what happened by now, which is not what I wanted to happen. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684105534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hqboe/aita_for_wanting_my_sons_girlfriend_to_respect_my/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First of all, it doesn't sound like she's eccentric. It sounds like she was nervous. Second, just because you say grace doesn't mean everyone else has to. She wasn't disrespectful, she didn't get up from the table or talk during your prayer, she just didn't join in. She even explained to you that she just didn't know how it worked!\n\nI also think it's pretty ironic that you're angry she didn't say grace, yet you showed her zero grace yourself.", "Yta\n\nShe sat quietly while you prayed. That is the definition of respecting your religion. You\u2019re mad that she didn\u2019t engage in performative theatre to adopt your religion.", "YTA, gigantic asshole.  You were trying to show dominance, stop pretending it was anything else.   If I were your son,  you'd meet anyone I was interested in maybe after we'd married and we'd be very concerned about you meeting grandkids.  Stop being a bigot and grow up", "YTA\n\nShe wasn't talking or rolling her eyes or scrolling through her tik toks. She was sitting quietly and therefore was being perfectly appropriate while you said grace. *You* are a devout Christian but *your son* has chosen to date someone who *is not* a devout Christian. \n\nBe kind to the girls he brings home, whether it is this girl, or another girl in the future. He chose not to date a devout Christian this time, which means there's a good chance if they break up, he will not be looking to date a devout Christian the next time. It would not be wise to be nasty to the woman who may eventually become his wife and the mother of your grandchildren.", "YTA-She didn\u2019t have to bow her head to be respectful of the prayer. Keeping quiet is also respectful. Her manners weren\u2019t lacking. It\u2019s a real shame the same couldn\u2019t be said for yours.", "YTA - If you didn't want your son's girlfriend to find out what you said... that's a sign you shouldn't have said it.", "YTA-she told you she didnt understand and didnt know the manners or proper ways of your religion. Thats not a terrible excuse the poor girl explained herself. You can't expect her to have proper manners to something she has never known or grew up around. Instead of belittling her, encourage to teach her. Judge not and ye shall not be judged.", "YTA.  You are blowing this out of proportion.  She was just observing what was happening and wasn't being disrespectful.  You can't make someone pray if they don't want to.  She wasn't being disruptive, and this boils down to a \"you\" issue.  I say this as a Christian person myself.  You were actually rude to a guest in your home, and to your son.  You need to learn to accept people where they are at, and not expect them to conform to your beliefs the minute they enter your home.  She did nothing wrong here.", "YTA, Go read your bible to find out why.", "YTA- this is your religion not hers, why should she pretend to go along with it if she doesn\u2019t share your beliefs? Wouldn\u2019t that just be perfomative?", "YTA - Someone choosing not to pray with you when they\u2019re NOT religious is not disrespectful. Would you rather she pretended? She was observing your culture and you were outright rude to a guest in your home. That is very unchristian of you.", "If you had your head down and were praying yourself then how do you know what she was doing???", "YTA.   It sounds like she was respectfully quiet through your prayer. Asking her to bow her head is not okay. If someone is not religious, they are not religious; why would you want them to pretend on your account? \n\nYou rudely confronted her at your own table, and then you told your son not to bring her over again in a really snarky way. I wouldn't bring her back there and have her exposed to your intolerance again were I him. Of course she'll ask him why she's angry.  Your son is an adult now, and he will rightly stand up for his girlfriend. Giving him remarks like that is not acceptable. He is going to tell her because they are closer than you and your son are.  That's the way it is now.", "YTA. Why are christians the most hateful, spiteful, judgemental AHs? \n\nINFO: OP, have you even read the teachings if the Jesus you allegedly follow?", "YTA  \n\n\nThere are plenty of people, Christian and otherwise, who don't say grace at the table.  It's perfectly reasonable that someone might not know what to do when confronted with that for the first time.  You took what should have been a chance to show grace and kindness, and turned into you being a rude, snarky, holier than thou ASSHOLE who gives Christians a bad name  \n\n\nGo back, reread your Bible, and ask yourself WWJD?  It wouldn't be anything remotely like how you behaved, of that I am certain.", "Yta.  You should not expect other people to be forced to pray.  She said she didn't know property managers and didn't grow up Christian.  The only thing she needs to do is be quiet during a prayer.", "YTA and how would you know someone didn't bow their head, unless *you* failed to bow your head, which means you're an AH and a hypocrite.", "YTA. I sit quietly during these processes, but I\u2019m not going to pretend to pray. Respecting does not mean lying and participating. Which is what has always baffled me about these repressive Christians. You want me to lie? Though that was against your religion. Seem to be picking and choosing.", "YTA as a Christian myself, I will leave this thought. Jesus taught us to pray from the heart, and not for show. If she wasn't moved to bow her head, Jesus would've been happy that she was only doing what her heart motivated her to do.\n\nI am so tired of hearing, reading and seeing \"Christians\" act like this. Read the bible, meditate on it, and then try to see why you're out of line.", "What a surprise: another Christian trying to force their beliefs on others, and when that doesn't work, treat them like garbage. YTA. YTA all day long. Your god would be ashamed of your behavior.", "This can't be real. No parent is this clueless... but, I'll play along.\n\nTo start with, yes, YTA.\n\n>she still seemed on edge.\n\nWhich is really rather normal when an individual who cares deeply for your child is meeting you for the first time, especially if you're overbearing, domineering, or otherwise \"alpha\" in any capacity.\n\n>but my son's girlfriend acted like she didn't care at all.\n\n...because she doesn't. Does she have to pretend to be something and someone she's not just to win your approval? What kind of dick are you?\n\n> She again looked uncomfortable\n\nbecause you confronted her about something.\n\n>she didn't grow up Christian and doesn't really know the proper manners\n\n100% reasonable explanation. She literally didn't know what to do.\n\n>I thought this was a terrible excuse,\n\nbecause you're an asshole.\n\n> he should bring over a girl with better manners.\n\nbecause you're an asshole.\n\n>My son was furious at me\n\nbecause you're an asshole.\n\n> AITA?\n\nYup.", "YTA. She DID respect your beliefs\u2014she sat quietly as you said grace, as any respectful guest do. What she did not do is PARTICIPATE in your religious rituals, and it is absolutely unreasonable for you to expect her to do so.", "I\u2019m fairly sure Jesus had something to say about performative prayer, perhaps you should spend some time reading your book and reflecting on how you live those teachings, because you just put on a bad show for the team and made one potential convert think you\u2019re an asshole. YTA.", "From one Christian to another.... YTA.\n\nYou would only have known she didn't have her head bowed during the entire prayer if you had been watching her during the prayer. \n\nAlso.... better manners????\n \nCome on! Go read the epistles of Paul over and over. He talks about being respectful to others who have different beliefs and he even talks about people who do something because they understand your beliefs and how we as Christians are supposed to respond to them.\n\nI just.... can't. \n\nYou need better manners. Those better manners = not judging someone who doesn't understand your beliefs.\n\nI have so much to say but....ugh.....\n\nYou did not represent Jesus well today.", "YTA. \n\n>>Son's girlfriend acted like she didn't care at all. \n\nBecause she doesn't. She's not religious. She doesn't have to care. I'm the same way. I am not religious *at all* and while I will sit quietly while other people say grace or pray so I'm not being distracting and wait to start my meal until they're done, but I'm not bowing my head or participating in any way. I respect the right of religious people to do whatever they're going to do, but I will not be forced to participate in someone else's beliefs. \n\nFrankly, why were you paying so little attention to the prayer that you even *noticed* that she wasn't bowing her head? Perhaps you should take your own professed faith a bit more seriously rather than worrying about what other people are doing.", "YTA she said she didn\u2019t know what to do, and she wasn\u2019t disrespectful. \n\nBe careful what you say to your son, as this behavior could make him go no contact in the future", "YTA- would you follow prayer if you had dinner in a household of a different faith? You can\u2019t force people to perform religious rituals just because they are in your household. I can\u2019t believe I even had to say that. Maybe if she was laughing or something it would be disrespectful, but why would you expect someone who is not religious to do religious traditions?", "Next time, devote yourself to the prayer and let other people alone. YTA", "YTA because you shouldn\u2019t expect anyone to abide by your religious beliefs under any circumstances, which includes them being under your roof.", "YTA.  Not knowing prayer etiquette does not make her rude.  You on the other hand should focus on kindness and humility.", "As long as she didn't eat or talk during your prayer,  she was being respectful.  YTA", "YTA. You shouldn't push your religious beliefs on others. She wasn't being disrespectful, she was just raised differently than you. It's rude for you to say that she had bad manners because she didn't do what you wanted her to do.", "YTA. Well that wasn\u2019t very love thy neighbour of you.", "YTA of course she was on edge meeting the parents for the first time, saying grace isn\u2019t a thing in all households. You obviously didn\u2019t have your head bowed if you were busy judging her. And I married my husband when he was 19, it\u2019s been 29 years so I wouldn\u2019t be so sure she\u2019s just going to disappear because you don\u2019t like her. You don\u2019t sound very Christian, you sound very judgmental.", "So you found a girl trying to bond with and being nervous and anxious over meeting her boyfriend's parents, and you decided that she's just not good enough?\n\nYTA. Jesus would've loved for you to be compassionate and forgiving. Not whatever this is.", "YTA she did respect your religion. She just didn\u2019t participate in it because it\u2019s not Her religion or her way of worship. \n\nyou didn\u2019t show her respect by commenting on her not participating in your prayer.", "YTA no one needs to pray just bc you do. Leave her alone.", "YTA\n\n\nI am not religious and I am not going to bow my head. I will sit there quietly but I am not going to participate.  \n\n\nBeing shy and quiet the first time you meet your boyfriend's mom is totally normal.  \n\nYou need to apologize to HER.", "YTA.\n\nBut let's put you in her position. \n\nI will take you and your husband to dinner, before we eat I will put an Idol to Freyr on the table, and sacrifice an animal in his honour, and when I have doused the Idol in blood, I will expect yourself and your husband to participate in the rubbing of the Idol for fertility.\n\nAfter all, its only polite that you partake and participate in a religious ritual you know nothing about it?", "Ain\u2019t no hate like a Christian\u2019s \u201clove\u201d", "YTA. She didn\u2019t understand what was expected of her and might have thought she was being asked to pray by bowing her head. She just isn\u2019t the same faith but she didn\u2019t do anything to prevent you from practicing yours, so it\u2019s not clear what was unmannerly.", "Was going to give specific reasons on why YTA here but will just say the YTA for every single thing you did here and will continue to be TA as you have no clue why YTA.", "YTA.\n\nShe sat there quietly, didn't interrupt and let you go about your hocus pocus. \n\nShe doesn't need to conform to your gibberish.", "YTA, it would be one thing if she talked or was on her phone or something, then I would at least agree with you feeling offended for not respecting your choice to say grace. But you can\u2019t impose your religious beliefs on guests. If she was quiet and didn\u2019t join the prayer, that\u2019s her business. I think categorizing it as bad manners is not the correct take, and you are uncomfortable with your son dating someone outside your family\u2019s religion", "YTA. Christians are some of the most judgemental, meanest people I've ever met", "YTA. And a hypocrite too. How do you know she didn\u2019t bow her head and close her eyes, unless YOU didn\u2019t either and were staring at her the whole of the prayer to see how she behaved. Just because she\u2019s quiet and shy (is she really, or just this one time) doesn\u2019t make her eccentric.  The one thing you\u2019re probably right about is that she won\u2019t be back, mostly because SHE will likely drop your son faster than you can inhale to berate her \u201clack of manners\u201d for him trying to make her bow her head and participate just to appease you. You just want to show of your \u201cholier-than-thou\u201d attitude, which is the type of behavior that makes me ashamed to call myself a Christian. I truly believe that if Jesus were to return today, he would look at those who claim to be his believers and followers, shake his head sadly, then turn and walk away. All because of behavior exactly like this, which is NOT what he taught.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t have to pray if she\u2019s not religious, equally what if she\u2019s from another religion? You can\u2019t shove your religion down her throat and expect her to follow your rules when she doesn\u2019t want to, nor does she need to", "You don't sound very Christian to be honest. \n\nI would also seriously rethink the strategy of not caring how you treat her because she is \"temporary.\" That woman may very well end up being your future DIL and mother of your grandchildren.\n\nMy husband and I have been together 12 years, and you know when we met? When we were 19 living in the same freshman dorm. His parents treated me in a similar fashion because I wasn't Catholic. We haven't spoken in several years and they have never met our children. Just a window into your future if you don't seriously correct course. YTA", "YTA \n\nShe was respectful, she didn\u2019t start eating or talk through it.\n\nAs a host (and as a human in general) it\u2019s beyond rude to enforce your personal beliefs on others.", "YTA.   She sat there quietly not interfering with the prayer.  If she was saying stuff about this is stupid or something like that then she would be disrespectful towards your religious beliefs.", "YTA.  She didn\u2019t disrespect your beliefs, she just didn\u2019t know the etiquette.  You, on the other hand, were very disrespectful and a poor host for trashing your guest like that.", "YTA - She wasn't scoffing or rolling her eyes and saying, \"PUH-LEEZ,\" she was sitting quietly. She wasn't disrespecting your religion. You want someone to follow your religion, or at least pretend to and that's disrespectful to them. Your son is very likely to quit coming around at all if you don't start respecting him and his choices and him being 19 and the relationship not likely to last? So? Does that mean you can be rude and disrespectful to him and his date? What matters is how you treat them both, not whether or not the relationship will last forever.", "YTA. First of all, she really *could* not know proper manners around prayers because guess what, the world doesn't revolve around your particular religion. Second, not participating is not disrespectful, it would be different if she, like, took a shit on a Bible in front of you but simply refusing to pray in a religion that is not yours is not impolite. If you visited a muslim or Jewish house, would you say their prayers? And third, you just straight up said to your son that you don't take his relationship seriously. Sure, 19 is young, but to say what you said is a giant dick move. YTA big time.", "YTA. She WAS respectful. What you wanted was for her to participate in a prayer to a god she doesn\u2019t believe in, which is absolutely unacceptable. \n\nYou are the one not respecting her religious beliefs.", "YTA. \n\nLet me get this straight. This young woman\u2019s heinous crime- so heinous that you think your son should cast her away in horror and disgust immediately- was that she didn\u2019t know the correct etiquette around bowing her head for a Christian prayer?\n\nReally?! There\u2019s starvation, death, disease and war in the world, and you\u2019re clutching your pearls over someone\u2019s head position. Have you stopped to think that maybe, just maybe, she was shy, quiet and uncomfortable because she wasn\u2019t 100% certain on how exactly she was expected to behave? And that maybe she was trying hard to be watchful and respectful? \n\nAs a child, I was forced to go to lessons on Christianity until the age of 16. Huzzah for me. But one thing I did pick up is that Christians are supposed to welcome their neighbours, be kind to them and not judge them. \n\nYeah. I think you had better get to work on that. Your son can see your hypocrisy, snobbery and cruelty in all its horrible glory.", "and said she didn't grow up Christian and doesn't really know the proper manners for prayers and such.\n\nI thought this was a terrible excuse, \n\nYTA.      Why the hell would she know  something  she wasn't brought up with?\n\nYou aren't a welcoming  person at all.  So she's  shy and quiet.....you are strangers .\nAnd what's  wrong with eccentric????", "YTA - she very much respected your prayer. She didn\u2019t interrupt, she didn\u2019t comment, she didn\u2019t disparage.  You think \u201crespect\u201d is for her to be forced to participate in something she doesn\u2019t believe in, no matter how uncomfortable you make everyone around you.", "YTA, OP. She seems like a shy person but that doesn't make her eccentric. (Which with the way you said it seems like an insult moreso than an observation). \n\nYou shouldn't force someone to pray. What makes it even worse is it seems you WANT a reason not to like her. \n\nLeave the poor girl alone and work on your respect and manners.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m Christian and know the stuff but would not expect someone else who is not to know. I also would not consider what she did rude. It sounds like she was more confused then ever but did not want to interrupt. At least she was not criticizing you guys for your beliefs. Maybe next time (if their is one now) teach her what you guys are doing and show her the proper protocol.", "YTA \n\nNot everyone prays before meals. Get over it. If she was silent during your prayer, then that's all she needs to do.", "YTA. People might have a my-house-my-rules mentality in the comments but she\u2019s not religious and you\u2019re expecting her to be at dinner? Bizarre. Flip the narrative. If you went to your partners house for dinner and they were drag queens and expected you to put on a dress for dinner you would feel uncomfortable and say no too. (Although not implying drag queens would ever do that because they\u2019re not entitled nuts- so you\u2019re doubly TA for expecting this).", "YTA for being one of 'those people' and trying to force your religion on someone else. She didn't have bad manners, YOU DO.", "YTA. That\u2019s your religion not hers. She didn\u2019t interrupt or cause a scene she just sat quietly and allowed you to observe your religion. Your the one in the wrong for trying to force your religion onto someone saying they should take part.", "YTA.   \nYou're \"affronted\" because someone didn't bow their head while you said grace?  Grow up.  Stop being such a AH.  People don't need to bow their heads and pray to whatever magic sky fairy you believe in. If you didn't want your son to tell her, why did you tell him?  What kind of cloak and dagger passive aggressive A$$holery are you up to really?", "Typical \"christian\" you expect everyone else to do what you do. YTA, an actual Christian wouldn't have been an asshole because someone is different", "YTA -  I'm a Christian your age and I am fine with someone sitting out a prayer if they don't feel comfortable.    If she wants to get closer to God that's her journey but it takes time.", "YTA-I thought your God taught you to love others\u2026\u201dlet he who is without sin cast the first stone.\u201d", "OP is not making their religion appealing to the girlfriend since OP is so nasty. WWJD?", "YTA. It's not her religion, it's not her god, she doesn't need to bow before anyone or anything.\n\nBy the way, if your head was bowed how did you know hers wasn't? With a bowed head, you wouldn't have been looking over at her, you would have been looking down.", "YTA - The gf even stated that she didn't know what the proper response was during your \"prayer\", you ignored that and went to your son to disrespect his gf. He stood up for his gf (a truly great thing), yet you are mad at him and the gf.\n\nJesus wept, you are pathetic.", "YTA. To be disrespectful would\u2019ve been talking or laughing, she literally just stood there. Are you one of those boy moms who insists that you\u2019ll always be his first love???", "There's no hate quite like Christian love. \ud83d\ude44 YTA.", "YTA. Is this how you treat a guest? I grew up saying grace before every meal, but I would never ask someone who didn\u2019t bow their head why they \u201cdidn\u2019t show any respect for the prayer.\u201d Attempting to say this relationship isn\u2019t likely to last forever shows more terrible judgement.", "YTA - I\u2019ve never been around people saying grace and I\u2019d feel awkward and weird too. Your house your rules and all but you\u2019re just acting like a petulant AH, don\u2019t expect your son to want to spend time with you and involve you in his life if you\u2019re going to be this intolerable.", "YTA. She already said she didn\u2019t grow up Christian. Not every household is religious, and she doesn\u2019t know better. I think she was really well-mannered by sitting there quietly and waiting until you were done with your prayers.", "YTA, don\u2019t shove your religion down people\u2019s throat.", "I guarantee even if she had performed for you, you would have found something else not to like about her. Your post was brimming with judgemental disdain. How very Christian of you! YTA", "YTA. That\u2019s insane. Why would you want someone to fake a prayer?", "YTA, your son\u2019s girlfriend isn\u2019t Christian ajd obviously felt uncomfortable with praying.  You should have respected that, as her beliefs are valid and her business, not yours.", "YTA- She was respectful enough to not start eating or start talking. Not everyone is Christian.", "So someone is eccentric if they don\u2019t pray? Eesh YTA.", "YTA, the fact that your son threatened NC after this minor incident tells me you're often overstepping. You need to do a lot of self-reflection and try to figure where you're going wrong as a parent.", "YTA, what a bad \u201cChristian\u201c", "I have to say that it\u2019s hard to believe that a 54 year old doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s inappropriate to expect a guest to pray when that is not their custom.  I assume she wasn\u2019t playing the saxophone during grace.", "Yta. I\u2019m Jewish I\u2019m not going to pray with someone when Jesus\u2019s name is involved.", "YTA", "YTA.....did she speak during the prayer? Did she interrupt?  If all she did was sit there, she wasn't rude.  I don't pray, if others want to they can and I'll sit there and wait to eat until the prayer is finished.  What I won't do is participate.", "YTA why should she bow her head for a god she doesn't believe in", "So by \"having better manners\" you mean being cristian, right? Cause God forbid other slightly different people exist.", "YTA\nShe showed respect of your faith by remaining quiet for you. You did not show respect for her. You did not practice your faith. You showed that you don't respect others so you did not deserve respect.", "YTA. What\u2019s with all the trolls lately", "YTA. \n\nShe didn't bow her head during grace. She didn't say anything mean or behaved badly on purpose. \n\nYou're rigid, judgemental and desperately trying to be victimised. Proper \"Christian\"", "YTA. Keep it up and your son won't be coming home often.", "YTA. She is shy and awkward around new people. That doesn't make her eccentric. And she didn't know what to do, so she didn't. It wasn't like she said anything negative. You are just looking for reasons not to like her.", "YTA. You disrespected your son's relationship for no reason. You cannot force people to be Christian, or force your children to date others of the same religion. You could have easily just informed her 'well, when we say grace we do this, we would appreciate if you'd bow your head or if you feel uncomfortable and want to leave while we do so you can.' I don't know the etiquette for saying grace, I'm not Christian myself, but what you did was disrespectful and kinda cowardly.", "YTA - she was your guest and didn't believe what you believed. She was clear when you asked about why she didn't copy you. \nYou should have been a gracious hostess, with a warm welcome and instead you assumed she was a liar. \nYou then decided to insult your son, belittled his choice of woman and double down on your assumption that she is a liar by telling him she has bad manners. From your son's perspective she did nothing wrong.\n\nYou should have gotten to know her better and talked before dinner. If you'd asked you would have found out that she didn't come from a religious house and you could have advised her on what you do and told her not to worry if she doesn't want to join in just be quiet while you all finish.\n\nYou've put yourself in a right pickle and If I were you I'd apologise to your son as soon as you can.

His college is a few hours from where I live, but this weekend, he came to visit with his girlfriend in honor of Mother's Day. It was my first time meeting his girlfriend, who he met doing college extracurriculars. \n\nHis girlfriend (19F) is a lovely girl, but very eccentric. She was very shy and quiet when my son introduced us, even though I did my best to welcome her into our home. Even when we had begun talking and everyone was more relaxed, she still seemed on edge. \n\nThe conflict came when we sat down for Mother's Day lunch. My husband said grace, as he always does, but my son's girlfriend acted like she didn't care at all. She just looked at us as we all bowed our heads, and even when my son indicated she should do the same, she didn't. \n\nAfter my husband finished, I asked why she didn't show any respect for the prayer. She again looked uncomfortable, and said she didn't grow up Christian and doesn't really know the proper manners for prayers and such. \n\nI thought this was a terrible excuse, but kept quiet as to not ruin lunch. Afterwards, when my son and his girlfriend were getting ready to go, I pulled him aside and said that next time, he should bring over a girl with better manners. \n\nMy son was furious at me, and said that next time he plans to bring the same girl, and if I don't like that there won't be a next time at all. I tried to say that he's only 19 and it's very unlikely this relationship is forever, but he didn't want to hear it. He and his girlfriend left, and the last thing I heard her say was her asking him why he was so angry. He's probably told her what happened by now, which is not what I wanted to happen. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As someone who USED to be a Christian, this is the perfect response. 100% YTA", "YTA- \n\nThis is how I feel- I will sit politely and quietly and wait for you all to do what you want to do- but I'm not going to pray or pretend to. \n\nWhat it comes dowb to is that OP thinks it's rude to not believe as he does", "I\u2019m the same I\u2019m polite but I\u2019m Jewish and I\u2019m not going to pretend to pray to Jesus", "I've always thought it more disrespectful to them and their faith to go along and pretend, knowing you don't believe.", "He did in fact. In the Sermon on the Mount he said orayer should be done wuietky and privately and should not include requests but express gratitude and worship.\n\nI know you know this, I'm saying it for those who don't :)", "\u201cYou would only have known she didn\u2019t have her head bowed if you had been watching her\u201d\n\nThis reminds me of the reign of Bloody Mary, where anyone could dob in someone they didn\u2019t like for not looking during the raising of the Host in church, and that person get tortured/killed. I always wondered why no-one asked the dobbers why they weren\u2019t reverently watching the Host themselves, cause that\u2019s the only way they could catch someone else out, right?", "I disagree, she sounds very judgmental, which is actually *very* christian of her.", "\u201cOh, you weren\u2019t raised with these beliefs and don\u2019t know the tradition? That\u2019s a terrible excuse. You should be ashamed.\u201d", "There is no hate like \"Christian love\"  They can be the most vile and judgmental people all in the name of Loving Jesus.   I cant stand hypocrisy like that", "As someone raised in this terror, I second this", "She may literally have never been told what the appropriate thing to do is. I am very awkward during the ceremonies for other religions when I don't know the expectations.\n\nOP is the AH for assuming that the worse etiquette breech was the girlfriend not knowing what to do instead of OP not sharing expectations with the person. 'We normally bow our heads in prayer before a meal. You don't need to join in, but please wait for us to finish before starting your meal.'", "Right?  I was raised religious but am an atheist.  When people pray around me  I absolutely do not bow my head  and pretend I'm praying because why would I do that?", "Honestly. If she was quiet during the prayer then that\u2019s respectful enough.", "It\u2019s always the religious ones!! So very judgmental of everyone,even when they are taught \u201cgod\u201d is the only one who can judge.", "I'm sorry, but imagining a family praying with epic sax guy performing in the background just killed me :'D", "Exactly. And if she were honest with herself, OP isn\u2019t mad that the girlfriend didn\u2019t pray. She\u2019s mad that the girlfriend isn\u2019t Christian.", "And when my Jewish friends pray, I'm a respectful non-participant.  I hope you do the same.", "Well stated.  Many cultures might find it disrespectful to participate more fully.  Without genuine belief participation can be viewed as disrespect.", "For my favorite, let\u2019s stay with Matthew in 6:6, \u201cwhen you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen.\u201d", "My house? My rules. Your house? Show some respect to your guests.  I imagine this captures her views on guests", "If this was my mother and that\u2019s how she treated a person I cared about I don\u2019t think I would want to subject them to my mother again. \n\nThe OP doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance right now\u2014maybe never. \n\nOP YTA. And you just further proved how religious people are the worst.", "God, I hope so. Amen", "She not required to bow her heard to show respect for the prayer. She didn\u2019t say or do anything. She allowed them to do it and move on.", "We don't know what kind of indication he gave her or that she understood it. Not everyone is good at reading signals.", "But she might not have known what that meant; she could have thought she was being asked to participate in a prayer.", "Expand", "she did follow proper manners - she kept quiet and observed respectfully. it would've been disrespectful for her to pretend to pray when she doesn't believe in it imo", "I don\u2019t think the girlfriend is Christian I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was raised a different religion. I\u2019m lucky because my last boyfriends family didn\u2019t expect me to say grace as I\u2019m Jewish and wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.", "I'll bet any money that if tbe OP went for a meal at her son and girlfriend's the parents would expect there to be grace out of respect to their beliefs.\n\nMy house, my rules. Your house, show some respect to your guest", "Absolutely how it read to me", "Yeah I\u2019m respectful certainly but I don\u2019t bow my head. Doesn\u2019t sound like the girlfriend was being disrespectful either", "I grew up Christian and faking a prayer to be seen as religious is considered very bad bcs you're basically pretending in front of the men and lying to god.\n\nIs so weird that OP being so religious as she is, is not aware of that.", "If he indicated that she should bow too, then she should bow, unless it conflicts with her religion.  Their house,  their rules.", "That's fair.  Assuming that the signal was clear,  she should have bowed. Either way,  OP shouldn't have said anything, and she should bow next time.", "All the mother wanted is for her to bow her head, she didn't have to actually pray. But I agree that it would've been rude", "Honestly i feel bad for the girl.", "Or, if there was a prayer from a different culture or religion, that wouldn't \"count\".", "Nope, that's not how it works. You make a choice to follow a cult and it's traditions, but you can't expect someone who isn't religious to blindly follow your customs. I bet anything that if I held a dinner and prayed to Satan before the meal these folks would not abide to my customs. \nLet's stop calling it rude when it is truly rude to force people into your beliefs.", "It was not told beforehand. You can\u2019t be upset someone broke a \u201crule\u201d they weren\u2019t told about beforehand.", "Nobody actually said this to her though\u2026the son \u201cgestured\u201d for her to bow her head- how is she supposed to even know what the gesture means if she\u2019s never prayed before?", "Of course not, heaven forfend!", "I've prayed with people of many, many religions.  When I'm praying,  I pray my way.  When they're praying,  they get to decide how I participate.  They ask me to cover my head,  I do it.  They ask me to sit quietly,  I do it.  They ask me to just bow my head,  I do it.  They ask me to sacrifice virgins with them,, well,  no. But that's because it's in contradiction to my own morals. She isn't being forced into beliefs.  She's being asked to show respect while she's in their home.", "Has she never watched TV or movies before?"]}
