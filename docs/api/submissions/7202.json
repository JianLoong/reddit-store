Preteens/teens are not the most understanding/caring people most of the time, but it will get better.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a great mom, stay strong.", "NTA.  Your daughter is upset and wishing things were back the way they were.  Sounds like you did as much as possible to bring normalcy to your kids under difficult circumstances", "NTA - of course a 13 year old thinks it is as easy as working more hours, she has no concept of the things you deal with\n\nYou are doing an amazing job \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "NTA you weren't doing it for selfish reasons as in it's just something you couldn't handle. It was a real reason like money being tight, and you plan on making it up to him. He seems to understand too. If you had outright refused, yes you would have been. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFiona's a kid, and while it's nice she's defending her brother it's also hard on you to work extra hours and be a single mom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus look at it this way, Emory has a special event and something to look forward to after his birthday so in a way he gets 2 birthdays, and it's extended. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so very sorry for your loss, and I hope you and your family are all leaning on each other. Plus you sound awesome, so don't beat yourself up too much!", "NTA, your kids are just going to have to accept that this is the new norm for a while.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. This is a teachable moment for you kid.\n\nBeing disappointed as a kid is inevitable, sooner or later. What makes the difference ultimately is how YOU handle it. You handled it well, you acknowledge that it's not fair, but that you'll make up for it. That's all that matters.", "Absoultely no. You're an adult with 4 children that lost her spouse. Money is tight and as awesome as traditions can be, its not a good idea to splurge.\n\nHonestly all of your worlds have changed. It might be a good idea to intiate a new, lower cost tradition. As for your daughter, at 13 she's still just a child and has no.concept of caring for children or budgeting money.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. Wish you better days. Hang in there", "NAH. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. You understandably can\u2019t take your son to the birthday dinner and offered a good alternative by making it up once you get paid again. Your kids aren\u2019t assholes because they\u2019re young and grieving and of course they want things to stay the same as if always has been. They\u2019re going to be upset and not understand why you can\u2019t keep things the same.", "NTA - please cut yourself some serious slack. \n\nChildren will be children and it sounds like you're truly doing your best to provide for them in a heartbreaking situation. I don't think the kids are being assholes either, they're just being kids and will come to regret saying things like that in the future when they come to understand things a bit better.", "NTA.  Parenting is quite often a thankless job.  We honestly try and do the best we possibly can for our children, but are unable to give them all the things they want\u2014or that we want to give them\u2014at times.  The fact that you don\u2019t tel your child why is fine.  They shouldn\u2019t have to worry about such things.  It takes time, but hopefully they will one day see the love you provide and understand why you must occasionally deny them some luxuries. My condolences for the passing of your husband.", "NTA. I've been where you are. Learning how to navigate as  single parent after the death of your spouse takes time. You will make some missteps, but just do the best you can and when things get better, you will do better.", "NTA. You love your kids, but you're not their friend (yet anyway). So you gotta stick to your guns, you know why you're doing what you're doing. Yeah, it sucks, I've been into tough spots before, where it hurts to not do the things you want to do. Things are different for you now, and unfortunately, it is for the kids too.\n\nDo what you have to do to make sure the kids are provided the necessities first. Everything else comes second. When your children are older, they'll see what you did for them, and honestly, they'll learn from it and respect you even more. I'm sorry for your loss, and hope things get easier.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. Keep up the good parenting.", "NTA. \n\nIf you can't afford it, that's just the way it is. You explained it well and your son understood.\n\nSpending time with your kids is important, and working extra hours to buy them more things (or a restaurant meal) can be counterproductive.\n\nYour daughter is a teenager, they'll often have opinions, and often they'll be against whatever the parent has decided just to assert their individuality. That's normal, do not read too much into it.", "NTA, I'm sorry for your loss. It makes sense though why it wouldn't be in the cards right now.", "It's rough that your kids have to learn that things have changed due to changed financial circumstances, but it's also important that you are honest with them and are doing your best to continue family traditions.\n\nDon't feel guilty. You're doing your best and when they are grown, your kids will understand how hard you worked to keep their world as normal as possible.\n\nNTA at all", "It was mighty easy of your daughter to tell you to work extra hours. NTA.", "NAH. \n\nYou're doing your best in tough circumstances. Equally, it is understandable that he feels disappointment. \n\nNobody sucks here. It is just an unfortunate situation at a time where everybody's emotions are heightened. \n\nSorry for yours and your family's loss and all the best for the future.", "NAH.\n\nYou are now suddenly living off one income, and that means you can't sustain the same quality of life as you did when you ha two.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those 'extravagances' that you cannot afford is doing both the gift and the restaurant in the same pay period. It sucks, it really does, but it is not your fault.\n\nThe kids are allowed to be upset at the change. Because they are KIDS, and emotions are strong at that age. And my guess is that you have been shielding them from the realities of your new financial situation. Because they are KIDS and deserve to not have to worry about that shit. But, the side-effect of that, is that they do not understand. They don't understand how hard it is for you, how hard it is to make ends meet, how bad you are feeling for failing to provide them with the same luxuries they had before.\n\nYour kid not getting his birthday meal... that sucks. Really, it does. One special thing for him, one thing he looks forward to, one piece of normalcy after everything he's been through, and it's being pushed off. But that isn't your fault.  You have been placed in a very difficult position, trying to do the best that you can for your kids. Unfortunately, sometimes, your best is going to disappoint them. All you can do is keep doing your best, and hope that when they're older, they recognize you for what you *did* give them.  \n\n\nEdit: Typos", "Sorry for your loss to begin with. \n\nAnd NTA how can you even ask. You do all to hang in there. To get it organised while dealing with your kids grief although you yourself are also grieving. \n\nYour daughter is a teenager. And yes they can be insensitive at normal times. When hurt or in pain even more so. So do not take it personally. However, what your daughter said was inconsiderate. And as they are growing up (teenager or not) they need to learn that words hurt just as much as fists and swords and that they must watch their talks. \n\nOf course its unfair that your son did not get to go to the restaurant. But then its just even more unfair you lost your husband and that all is on you now. And its so absolutely super unfair your kids lost their father. \n\nShe does not know what she is talking of. She is still a kid. But once things have cooled down a bit try to talk to her calmly. And let her know that parents are also only humans. Neither can they work miracles, nor are they immune to hurtful comments. \n\nTell her you are in this together and you all will have to adjust like it or not. You promise to do your best and still be there for them. \nTry to be honest in a way that you let her know also for you this is difficult but you're confident you make it.", "NAH. You are all still grieving and you\u2019re doing the best you can. I am so sorry for your loss.", "I am so very sorry for the loss of your husband... I can't fathom that kind of heartbreak and seeing your young babies heart break too. I don't think you are the AH... I think you guys are in a place where you're all trying to find a new normal.\n\nWith that said - I do think your son needs as much 'normal' as he can get. I don't think you're an AH by any stretch but I am sad too that he didn't get his birthday dinner. It was a tradition for you all and now that his dad is gone - it's another thing that is missing.\n\nI'm glad you are going to be able to take him to his restaurant but just at a later date because things like that hit different when there's already so much loss. But I don't blame you for not having the money to do it.\n\nFiona is grieving too and loss does weird things to people, plus she's 13. My heart is heavy for all of you in such a hard time. You are an amazing mama to love your kids so much. \n\nUsually the moms worried about being bad moms - are the best moms. Bad moms don't care enough to be worried.\n\nI hope that you guys settle into a new normal full of love and happy traditions going forward. <3", "NTA. It feels like a big deal in this moment but a little disappointment is a good life lesson. And you were honest about why. I grew up pretty low income and it wasn\u2019t kept a secret. It made me much more thoughtful and considerate as I got older. Years from now he\u2019ll only remember a mom that worked hard to provide for four kids.  Be kind to yourself, you are doing great.", "NTA \n\nYou are a widow with several children. Things would not have stayed the same, especially with todays inflation. You did the best you can, with favorites meal and still picking up present together.", "NTA. He's 11. He has to learn to be patient. Idk about Fiona though, maybe show her your bills so she understands. She is the oldest after all.", "NTA you're trying your absolute best", "Of course what one kid says is going to hit home more than normal right now but doesn't mean they are right. you have to look at the long game and what is right for you financially. NTA", "NTA. At some point once he is older, your son will realize you were doing your best in the situation. Kudos to you for trying to make his day special in spite of the circumstance. I cannot imagine what you are going through.", "NTA, you\u2019re trying to balance a lot.  Saying you just need to work extra hours is flippant.  Who is going to care for children?  Extra daycare etc?  Unfortunately, with your husbands passing, things will need to change.  Eventually your kids will figure out that you are trying.\n\nOne day at a time.", "First, my sincere condolences.\n\nSecond, NTA. I understand his disappointment and frustration, but circumstances have changed, inflation is through the roof, and necessities are more important than birthday dinners. Making his favorite homemade meal was a nice compromise.", "NTA at all. Very understandable to feel guilty, but no where cost to being the AH. You told him the truth and make sure you follow through.", "NTA at all. I am also a widow, my late husband passed suddenly on the morning of our daughters 15th birthday. He worked away and had to attend a training so we celebrated the day before we got up at 4:00 am he kissed our daughter goodbye. I dropped him off at the airport at 5:15 at 5:45 I received a phone call from the hospital then a phone call from a friend who worked at airport. He was in perfect health, even the autopsy took 6 weeks and the best they could figure was his electrical in his heart stopped and would not restart. Her first birthday he was gone she got a memorial tattoo, his second we took some ashes to the ocean he worked on. I was fortunate I made okay money myself and was able to start a business, most people are not that fortunate. There are going to be days when your kids are going to be angry at you because they need that safe person who they know will still love them even if they get angry. Mine hated me most of the time that first year because she could not hate her dad for leaving. No if it is rational and is so exhausting. Please take advantage of what ever survivors and widows help is in your area and if you are in the states I hope someone helped you signup for a widows and kids social security benefits. DM is you have questions with that.", "NTA\n\nYour kids don't understand and they're still grieving", "NTA\nAlso, you are not dumb and shouldn't necessarily have worked extra hours to afford the restaurant.  I understand you want to maintain what's normal for your kids. You're all grieving the loss of their dad.\n\n I'm sure there was a loss of income, too, and you're having to adjust to that.  It's also ok to explain that you can't afford it. Cooking the favorite meal is a great new tradition. \n\nI'm sure whatever you do will be from a place of love for your kids, so don't beat yourself up during this difficult time.", "NTA Start a different Birthday tradition. Losing a parent is hard at any age.  Instead maybe they pick what type of cake and dinner you make that night along with choosing a game everyone will play together or movie to watch.  Could wake them up for Breakfast  with pancakes made into the number/ age they are turning.  You can fill up their bedroom full of balloons while they sleep or living room with Happy Birthday signs everywhere.  They will remember those memories and moments more than dinner at a restaurant. You could even tell the kids to honor Dad we will save up and go out to dinner at Dads favorite restaurant on his Birthday  and have a special jar that when ever any of you go out and finds change on the ground it goes into Dad\u2019s Birthday Fund or you make his favorite for dinner.  I say that because when I miss my Dad or need him he will leave me dimes\u2026it helps make me feel like he is still around.  I told my Mom when she dies, if she would to please leave me 100 dollar bills instead of dimes. It is now a running joke in our family.  \n\nThe cost of going out to dinner has gotten to expensive.   One way to reduce cost is lunch time instead of dinner.  If work and school conflict with lunch then celebrate with next possible day you can.   \nAs the kids get older they will gain a new respect and understanding of your current struggles.  Making sure they have a safe place to live, healthy food, clothes, health care, etc..the basics ..then comes the extras.  \nThe  HARDEST part of being a parent and adult is having to say No to your kids.  Doing what you have to vs what you want! I hate that your daughter said you should have worked more, just so you all could go out to dinner, because you are not only working, but now dealing with grief and taking care of 4 other tiny humans who are grieving and also adjusting to a new norm.   Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.   Surround yourself with friends and family as emotional support net.  More than anything the kids just need love, hugs, kisses, words of encouragement, and that they are not alone, they have you and each other!! \nKeep on Momma!!", "You need to make your kids knowledgeable of your financial situation. Bc I don\u2019t believe Fiona would have said that had she been aware. That was pretty insensitive", "NTA. And you gave a reasonable alternative. You are taking him when you get paid next. That\u2019s better than not at all when money is tight. Maybe you should tell him about the plumber bill. He needs to realize that sometimes unexpected expenses like that cause us to have to change our plans. He needs and so does Fiona, to know that life doesn\u2019t always go the way we want it to or plan.  You used the money for his birthday dinner at a restaurant to pay the plumber that was needed at the house and couldn\u2019t wait. His birthday restaurant dinner can wait. It was not unreasonable to reschedule it. \n\nThey\u2019re not entitled and both of your kids are dangerously walking that line of entitlement.", "NTA.\n\nAnd please don\u2019t take a child\u2019s opinions about how you should handle your finances seriously. A 13 year-old has no real grasp of what it means to run a household.", "NTA. I think you must have meant to post this in r/Kidsarestupid.", "NTA\n\nYou are being a bad parent though, not teaching your kids the value of money and work. \"Just work extra hours\" would make my parents ground me, not go to AITA and ask if they are assholes.\n\nCancel the tradition entirely.

Restaurant parties come after you are done with the other stuff.", "PSA: a reminder to get life insurance on your spouse when you are young so one of you is not left without, especially during a time of deep grieving.

This will all blow over when you take him out to the restaurant for his birthday. \n\nRight now, there are just hurt feelings. Life has changed for them, and the birthday had to change with it. Sometimes, change just makes it hard to cope with. Also, sometimes working extra hours doesn't equal more pay.

Just hang in there, one day at a time..", "op=NTA\n\nSorry, Fiona, Mommy has enough on her shoulders, you don't get to tell her to just work a few extra hours.  That is pretty presumptuous of Fiona to tell you about all your free time as a mother of 4.\n\nI'm sorry Emery feels bad just as you do, but sometimes that's how the cookie crumbles and an 11 yr old is old enough to understand that some things have to wait.", "You gotta do what you gotta do.
