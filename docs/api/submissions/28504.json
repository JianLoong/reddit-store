They should have immediately communicated their intentions with you. \n\nThat said, it might be worth considering why it is that none of these people wanted to live with you. The one friend leaving and then coming back after you\u2019d been kicked from the group suggests they left bc they specifically didn\u2019t want to live with you.

It sounds like this has been more gradual and the dynamic is different than it used to be. You can try having a real conversation about all your feelings but it may just be that you don't like each other anymore so they've been slightly taking advantage for a while. You don't have to hate their guts it's not like they are evil, but imo you can try to accept and more past it without feeling guilty.", "NTA.\n\nTechnically, she's the one that threw the friendship away.

They purposefully kept their plans secretly and screwed you over. Do you really want to live with that selfishness and immaturity? Obviously two-faced as well.

They watched me turn down other safe places under the guise that I was living with them, and they had me dealing with all of the finances and other planning. Once it got closer to the lease renewal they finally admitted that they planned to just kick me out last minute by not saying anything until needed. With friends like that bunch I don't need enemies so I cut my losses and went on to search for mature roomates that can communicate and don't try to screw people over.", "I spoke to a current roommate about this and they would have been more than happy to live with me again & felt torn on where/who to live with & stated they didn\u2019t understand where she was coming from.

I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve drifted more so just matured.
