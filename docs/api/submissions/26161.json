So anyway this year it hit me hard and I just started thinking why should I even give them my time when they never once even attempted to help me out even tho they are my parents and whenever they have issues I'm always the first one to help. So recently I got a severe lecture from my other grandmother and also other family members for not speaking with them but honestly I just don't care. So I wanted to know if I am being the a-hole here or not.", "created_utc": 1693765284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16945zp/aita_for_giving_my_parents_the_silent_treatment/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
