Prior to that, we had purchased a house on several acres in a rural, hilly area.\n\nMy wife had 2 nieces, Anna and Beth. When Anna got engaged, she asked if she could have a small ceremony and reception on our property. We said ok and Anna got married on our front porch with the guests seated on the lawn.\n\nA few years go by and my wife passed away suddenly. This was a very dark period that took me a long time to pull out of. My wife\u2019s family and I had always gotten along well enough but we didn't speak after the funeral, which I didn\u2019t hold against them. I could have called them to see how they were doing but it was too painful in the months after my wife's death and it just felt like a gulf between us in the time since. \n\nRecently I was reached out to by Beth, the younger of my wife\u2019s nieces. She said that she had gotten engaged & is going to have her wedding at my home, just like Anna. Beth claims that my wife promised her she could have her wedding at our house during the planning for Anna\u2019s wedding, and that Anna had her heart set on this for years. \n\nI have a few issues with this. For one, as far as I am aware this promise was never made and my wife was not the sort to agree to anything like that without discussing it with me. Another is that it isn't feasible to have the same set up at my house as it was for Anna. Not long after Anna\u2019s wedding, my wife and I started a project that removed all the non-native grass from the lawn and seeded native grasses.This was a passion project of my wifes and I've maintained the prairie areas  as my wife and I had them, with a few minor changes here and there. \n\nLastly, this is my home. I had not seen or heard from Beth for years and having her call me to tell me what she was going to do with my home did not sit well with me. My wife was never especially close with her sister or nieces and I have probably seen them 6 times total, with most of those occasions being related to Anna's wedding so it really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI told Beth that the wedding could not happen here, saying that regardless of everything else, the lawn has been turned to prairie and there is nowhere for the ceremony. Beth just told me I could mow down the grass and let it regrow afterwards, to which I said absolutely not, I wasnt going to alter the home my wife and I built for her wedding. \n\nBeth flipped out, told me she was promised and that she was counting on having her wedding at my home. \n\nI told her in a calm, straightforward manner it wasn't going to happen twice, over her protests before I told her my decision was final and hung up the phone.\nSince then, I have had my wife's family, who I have not heard from since her funeral, calling me nonstop to tell me how I\u2019m going back on my wife\u2019s word and treating Beth horribly.", "created_utc": 1671234137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znsmly/aita_for_not_letting_my_wifes_niece_get_married/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was up to them to initiate contact with you and not vice Versa, and they failed.\n\nYour wife obviously did not make any promise to Beth about her wedding, or she would not have started the prairie project with you.

A relationship with you prior to demanding the use of your property for her wedding?", "NTA - and if you didn't reach out much after your wife's passing, they obviously didn't care enough to bother either.  That's a freaking truckload of entitlement going on for your niece to simply announce that you are hosting her wedding and to tell you to just mow down the specially seeded grass for her wedding.

Most likely Beth is either lying or at least exaggerating about your wife telling her that; my guess is it was mentioned in an off-hand manner with your wife being non-committal but not dismissing the idea outright, especially since you said your wife wouldn't have agreed without discussing it with you.

How is that relevant?", "Is that a yes?", "When he was fine with one niece getting married at his house but not the other, it makes me wonder.", "Does it matter? I can\u2019t see how it would.", "You don't think a potential *other* motivation for not wanting the wedding at his house that he's not willing to share because it makes him look bad is relevant?", "No it's not, but I'm guessing you're asking for some shitty reason", "Except he gave perfectly acceptable and strong reasons to say no, and therefore there is no reason to suspect other motives.", "Do you not understand he no longer has a yard, a wife or a connection to his wife\u2019s family?", "He told us why. Something about the grass and the fact that these people have not contacted him since his wife passed . And the fact they didn\u2019t act they TOLD him what they were going to do. It doesn\u2019t matter if she was marrying a ghost, you can just call someone out the the blue and tell them what to do with their property.", "His reason was the issue of the timing, them not speaking, expecting him to honor a promise he doubts was made, and the logistics of the new meadow. No where was there an issue of Beth\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Seems like Beth herself is more the issue", "Because his wife was alive then. It's not that deep. The family didn't give a shit about him after his wife's death. Not even a phone call to see if he was okay. But they want to use him for something now, many years later.

Is the reason your family is pissed off at you because they believe you're a homophobe?", "I wasn't sure, so I asked. His response confirmed my suspicions. You're all getting played by a homophobe.

And I'm pretty sure I was right!", "> No where was there an issue of Beth\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\n\nThat's because he very deliberately avoided mentioning her fiance. And now we know why!", "> The family didn't give a shit about him after his wife's death.\n\nYou think that this may, possibly, be related to his homophobia?", "Unnecessary, I think. And on a subject like this, maybe not super kind to probe too much. He said several years, right? There\u2019s no excuse for their behavior in any case.", "> How about the fact that none of them have spoken word one to him since the funeral of his wife?\n\nWhich is curious, right? I guess it's possible the entire family is evil for no reason, but in my experience homophobes are far more common than evil families.", "Not his family and most likely upset at not getting a free venue.", "He doesn't even need a reason. No is a complete sentence.", "What are you even talking about? The gender of Beth\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is never said. Stop making dumb assumptions", "Where does it say that the first niece married a man at his home? I missed that.", "It's rude to probe when OP is ***literally asking us for our opinion on the matter***??\n\nIf you disagree with me that's fine. Quite frankly I think your first reply to me was incredibly unnecessary and somewhat rude. At no point did I ever, ever say that OP was TA. You're projecting assumptions and acting alarmingly entitled just because I had the \"audacity\" to ask a very simple and not at all disrespectful question in an AITA thread.", "Calm down, dude. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so upset. I hope the rest of your night gets better.", "Please point to the homophobia in the post. Pretty please.", "You win the gold in the mental gymnastics. Why you go for a leap, you take the biggest!", "He might not \"need\" one, but if his reason is \"I don't want a gay marriage at my house,\" that would make him the asshole. Little surprise he didn't bring up any detail that might imply that, huh?", "I didn't make an assumption, I asked. He responded but refused to clarify, which was enough to answer my question.", "That's because he was very vague in his post in order to fool people. You were fooled. There's no harm in that. But there's also no reason to go to bat for some dude you don't know.", "Also, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re clear on what about half of those words mean. Maybe take a little time to look them up.", "That does not answer your question. He asked the relevance which you did not answer.", "Troll", "You ok fam?", "Whether or not there's a possible, alternative explanation for his refusal is extremely relevant to the question of who the asshole is in this situation.", "I understand it's difficult to admit that you got played. But the truth will always set you free."]}
