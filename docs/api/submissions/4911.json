I could have called them to see how they were doing but it was too painful in the months after my wife's death and it just felt like a gulf between us in the time since. \n\nRecently I was reached out to by Beth, the younger of my wife\u2019s nieces. She said that she had gotten engaged & is going to have her wedding at my home, just like Anna. Beth claims that my wife promised her she could have her wedding at our house during the planning for Anna\u2019s wedding, and that Anna had her heart set on this for years. \n\nI have a few issues with this. For one, as far as I am aware this promise was never made and my wife was not the sort to agree to anything like that without discussing it with me. Another is that it isn't feasible to have the same set up at my house as it was for Anna. Not long after Anna\u2019s wedding, my wife and I started a project that removed all the non-native grass from the lawn and seeded native grasses.This was a passion project of my wifes and I've maintained the prairie areas  as my wife and I had them, with a few minor changes here and there. \n\nLastly, this is my home. I had not seen or heard from Beth for years and having her call me to tell me what she was going to do with my home did not sit well with me.

Beth just told me I could mow down the grass and let it regrow afterwards, to which I said absolutely not, I wasnt going to alter the home my wife and I built for her wedding. \n\nBeth flipped out, told me she was promised and that she was counting on having her wedding at my home. \n\nI told her in a calm, straightforward manner it wasn't going to happen twice, over her protests before I told her my decision was final and hung up the phone.\nSince then, I have had my wife's family, who I have not heard from since her funeral, calling me nonstop to tell me how I\u2019m going back on my wife\u2019s word and treating Beth horribly.", "created_utc": 1671234137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znsmly/aita_for_not_letting_my_wifes_niece_get_married/", "score": 813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And how incredibly callous, to tell you that you could just mow down something that your wife was passionate about, and that you planned and worked on together. The family abandoned you after your wife's death, and now only make contact to try to bully you. Block them and be done with them. They sound like entitled, awful people that you don't need in your life.", "Sometimes I read these posts, and I have to ask myself, how do people go through life behaving this way? \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, and even if your wife did make that promise, your wife is not here to fulfill it. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand how people can be so insensitive and so lacking in common sense to call someone after all this time and make demands like this. \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Who TF tells someone what they're gonna do in their home? These people have had no contact with you (which you say is ok as it's painful for you anyway). She probably assumed you'd just go with it. You owe them nothing.", "NTA as someone who grew up in prairie lands and knows what important ecosystems they are you shouldn't 'mow them down' to accommodate a one day event for people who have cut you off for years. Good for you for standing your ground and for cultivating the prairie in the first place.", "NTA. Set firm boundaries now,  or you will continue to be used.", "Sooooo she\u2019s got enough memory to remember how much she loves your property, but not enough memory to have a relationship with you? NTA. I would change your number and go no contact. I would even post signs that say, \u201cno trespassing, no loitering, no soliciting, private property all violators will be prosecuted.\u201d", "NTA. What are they going to do? Go NC??", "There are an awful lot of very similar, \"someone is dead, someone demanded a wedding, I said no\" stories floating around. This is the maybe the fourth one I've read recently. Is this really happening that often?", "NTA. Perhaps explain the significance of the prairie to your wife's family, who I'm sure are probably still mourning her too. Then perhaps you can get a few of these people off your back.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and sorry that you're being deemed a villain when you're just a grieving widow", "Beth didn't even call to say \"hey I'm getting married and (wife) promised me I could have my wedding at the house.

I know I couldn't say most of what Beth said or if I did I would feel guilty about it for years!\n\nAlso it dumbfounded me because op seems like a nice person, if Beth didn't act like a spoiled child and was considerate and understanding of op's concerns I bet she would be having her wedding at his house.", "When the first niece got married the changes to the landscape where not made. When the second neice  got married they where. Plus no one will tell me what is going to happen at my home.

She called him to inform him this was happening.  Her absolute audacity was more than enough reason to tell her no.", "Maybe he didn't mention the fiance because he hasn't met the fiance?  Or are you the fiance and have insider information?", "Not that I agree with being homophobic for any reason but the fact remains it his home l. He can refuse for any reason(even if they may be shitty) but it\u2019s still his right!", "You\u2019re pretty sure your wife wouldn\u2019t have made this promise without talking to you about it.  If the promise was made, it was made by 1/2 the ownership and that owner passed away.  Had you then sold the house, would she tell the next owner they had to let her use their house?  Of course not. Your wife passed away snd any undocumented promise she supposedly made surely passed with her.  \n\nShe can\u2019t prove the promise. Even if she could, your wife is gone and you are now the sole owner.  Imagine if this flies what they would tell you next.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.

NTA obviously \n\nI'm sorry for your loss. \n\nBut also please get cameras", "Why don't you confront them asking where were these guys all those years? If they can't care for you then  why you have to help them? NTA", "NTA.\n\nNot to be harsh here bro but simply put, dead people can't keep promises.", "NTA. Block all of them.", "Just stop answering their calls or texts or block them all. NTA", "NTA. Wow. She's got a set of brass ones, I'll give her that. And so does the family that thinks you're the problem.\n\nI'm sorry you lost your wife. I can't imagine how hard that's been for you. And I think it's such a beautiful tribute to her that you're keeping the house the way she wanted it. Don't mow it down.", "NTA- i'm so sorry for your loss OP. I'm appalled your wife's family turned out to be such assholes.", "NTA. To even ask you this - they should have made a lot more effort in the time since the funeral.", "NTA\n\nSo sorry you are subject to this abuse.\n\nIf what you say is factually accurate then your feelings and reactions are entirely appropriate. \nThe gall of you niece! to inform you of her plans for your home when she has not bothered with you for many years.\n\nThe family are cruel, heartless, thoughtless AHs.", "Let's take the promise  the family connections out of the equation, because I don't think they even matter.

She wants the grass mowed, you say no, case closed.\n\nThe family members who feel so strongly that you are slighting poor, poor Beth are showing how they could have reached out and offered you support after losing your wife, but they didn't care enough.  So, case closed there too.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She *told you* that she is going to have her wedding at *your home*??? the entitled rudeness of that alone is reason enough to refuse.", "NTA.  Your property.  Your choice.  Whenever you get a text.  Simply text back.  \"Two years.  Never a call.  Not to see how I was doing.  How I was getting along without my wife.  Nothing.  Now.
