{"id": 30325, "submission_id": "17ntiey", "title": "AITA for asking a neighbor to park closer to his own house?", "selftext": "We live in a townhouse. It\u2019s on the first of nine rows of townhouses. There are entrances to both sides. One road down has parking on both sides, and a larger parking lot attached about halfway down around rows 5-6. The road on my side only has parking on side. \n\nFor my row there is a grand total of 5 parking spots for 7 houses. There are three families with small children (us included), a woman on disability because of back issues, and three elderly people. In total we all have 6 cars for the 5 spots. Someone always had to park about 500 meters away at a gravel overflow parking lot. \n\nAbout a year ago, our postman moved into our complex on row 7. He started parking his car by our row (1). He starts work and gets off early so he\u2019s always home in time to nab one of the spots.\n\nAll the neighbors on our row constantly speculate as to why he parks so far from his own house, especially as he is by the large lot where there is always plenty of spots. Some think it\u2019s so he can smoke a cigarette p the way home, some think it\u2019s to get his steps in, others think he just wants to be as close to the exit as possible. \n\nThe resident board has asked everyone to park as close to their own house as possible, and sent out a map of where each row should be parking. However they can\u2019t enforce anything as there is technically no assigned parking. One neighbor has already pointed the rule out to him but was ignored.\n\nSo the other day i was pulling in right behind him and he pulls into the last spot on our row. I had the kids, bags from daycare, a stroller, and a box to carry in and I had to go park at the gravel lot and make multiple trips carrying everything. Again. \n\nI saw him walking to his car while I was taking out the trash and finally asked him why he parks so far from his own house. I told him we all actively wonder and discuss it on our row as it inconveniences the rest of us  (especially our disabled neighbor). \n\nHe blew up saying he has the right to park anywhere he wants. I said he has the technical right but that the board has asked us to avoid this and it\u2019s really inconsiderate to us since we have fewer spaces than all the other rows. He called me a lazy asshole for not wanting to park half a kilometer from my house. I told him I don\u2019t understand why we all should have to park further from our houses because he wants to park further from his own. \n\nHe made an angry post on the Facebook group. One of my neighbors said I shouldn\u2019t have confronted him (because he\u2019s our postman), while the others are grateful. I dunno if I should have just kept my mouth shut. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to update: just looked at the fb group again, hadn\u2019t seen it in two days. There were only three comments, one of which was from the head of the resident board. They all told him to park in the section designated for his row. \n\nIn other news, the past two days he\u2019s still parked in our section, except about 6 inches over the line to make it even harder to park next to him. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ", "created_utc": 1699126779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ntiey/aita_for_asking_a_neighbor_to_park_closer_to_his/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
