That's some pretty harsh stuff to come out of someone's mouth, especially in front of their parents. \n\nIt sounds like OP expected some of the jokes, which means that they aren't out of character. Her retort may have been below the belt, but it proved that while he can dish it out without thinking, he can't handle it being turned around on him.  Based on some of OP's comments, it sounds like he's just a misogynistic jerk who's jealous of his sister and wants to tear her down to make himself feel better.", "Nah no cringe here. I was infantry in the marines and infantry in the army. Wouldn\u2019t want any other job personally. It\u2019s rough and challenging but fulfilling.", "That's so cool! Do you mind giving me some advice? _Anything_ would appreciated!", "Don\u2019t quit. I\u2019m not sure how itb is now since I went 20 years ago, but the humps are long and a decent amount of field time. \n\nWe have women in my unit and they\u2019re treated the same though at least now. No difference in what their expected to do either. The Army\u2019s ACFT has gender scoring but for everything else they adhere to the same standards. \n\nI\u2019d like to think you won\u2019t get a lot of pushback but it will mainly be from fellow students. Don\u2019t feel ashamed if you need to report them tbh. That behavior doesn\u2019t have any part in the military. Overall though just have fun and embrace the suck. You\u2019re doing something most Americans won\u2019t.", "And I\u2019m going to do what I hated in the military was when people would piggy back off others, but any opportunity for training from online to any school house certifications volunteer for it, beg for it. A lot of people bitch and complain about it but it builds your \u201cportfolio\u201d. Plus when you ask leadership for some specialized school you can show command you don\u2019t waste your time and most importantly your not wasting others because you have completed x y z already and want to continue to learn and develop. Also remember it\u2019s not always about what you learn but who you meet along the way."]}
