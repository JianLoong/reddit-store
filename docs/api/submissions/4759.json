He was placed in the infirmary, but refractured his left tibia while on a run, so they medically discharged him. \n\nAnyway. I enlisted and graduated bootcamp (it fucking sucked lmao) and flew home to stay with my family. I got home really late so I just passed out on the couch. Sal woke me by yelling \"Our favorite wookie is home!\" right in my ear. I wasn't too bothered by the insult, since a lot of the male recruits were already calling me that in basic, so whatever. So, in typical sibling fashion, he decided to up the ante. \n\nFor the past couple weeks he's been insulting me non stop.

OP, you are 10times the bigger person in this scenario. I would have caused some serious physical harm to my sibling if I were in your shoes. To say this stuff to any Marine is shitty.
