That way your partner won\u2019t have to work so much later? Now, I completely understand you want time with the person you love. I truly do, but I do feel that they are trying to nest egg or something to have a better future for all of you. \n\nNow, if partner is NOT making extra money doing extra shifts than I get your frustration, but as I\u2019m not seeing that, try to look at it as a pain in the butt now for less pain in the butt later!   As I\u2019m not sure of your ages, I\u2019ll say this, if you\u2019re young, it\u2019s natural to want to be with someone as much as time allows and I get it, most people don\u2019t like or understand that we all need space, down time, work time, we just want to be together all the time.. when you have a family, that doubles down.  Especially when there\u2019s a household to run. Equal contribution is important. As we age, we realize that having our own interests together as a couple/family is still important, but we also recognize that we\u2019re all separate individuals with separate hobbies or interests that may not necessarily be thrilling for our partner.. and trust me, that\u2019s ok. So we do things separate. \n\nAnyway, try to look at the bigger picture, working now more to achieve the goal is actually better than working more later when you REALLY need the help setting up the new home etc. also you have a nest egg so you don\u2019t have to just \u201cmanage \u201c. \n\nVery very very soft YTA", "YTA\n\nYou're getting ready to move to a more expensive home and lifestyle, and have an extended large family.\n\nDude is breaking himself working to financially support you and the kids.

OP could very well be a Partially Stay at Home Father and it wouldn't make a difference. \n\nOn the other side, if OP is writing this on behalf of whoever feels this way into the relationship, I think we need to know their true perspective and not your point of view on how they see things. \n\nWhile I get where you're coming from, YTA for the approach you're taking.

I'm not trying to discuss but I think they're all doing important things and OP is just asking his partner to put a little bit of more time aside for their family."]}
