You also berate your partner. Also, if going to a party this weekend and then again the next, i get your partner.", "YTA, your partner is just being responsible. If you\u2019re not secure with money, working is much more important than going to a party and it seems like your partner understands that and is willing to sacrifice fun. Moving is also very expensive and you don\u2019t know what unexpected costs may arise.", "I don't think it's necessary to berate but INFO: can you afford it if your spouse opts not to work the extra shift?", "Never a good start if you're berating your spouse. \n\nHonestly, this sounds like a communication breakdown. It's understandable you want your spouse to have a good work/life breakdown but as the primary earner for a family who just upgraded, I understand they are probably feeling a lot of pressure as well.", "YTA, based on your comment that you\u2019re a \u2018bit financially unstable\u2019 right now. You\u2019re about to be increasing your expenses through this move, so your spouse is trying to make sure you are financially set. Meanwhile, from what you describe, they are neglecting \u2018parties\u2019, not your children or your family. It\u2019s OK to decline party invitations and you shouldn\u2019t really be accepting them on your spouse\u2019s behalf.\n\nIf you have concerns about how your spouse is balancing supporting the family and working, talk to them like an adult, don\u2019t \u2018berate\u2019 them.\n\nI will edit this to add, though, that I\u2019m slightly suspicious about this post and the user profile that goes along with it. If I had to bet, I might say that the OP here is actually the spouse and might be leaving out some details in order to win this argument with his wife. For instance, how much time he is finding to play video games. Just a hunch.", "Soft YTA your title said it all\u2026..you berated him not trying to communicate or talked with him. Berated him.

Those are extras that no one \u201cneeds\u201d to do & they don\u2019t pay the bills. \n\nInstead of telling your spouse what they\u2019re doing wrong how about asking what their goal is. Sounds like you have different perspectives & priorities. It appears no one understands what the goals are. \n\nThere\u2019s no way to judge this .... y\u2019all just need to learn how to communicate better. \n\nBased on berating ... YTA\n\neta \u2014 you\u2019re both on the same team. Don\u2019t work against each other. Your team will never win. Your spouse is complaining about being tired & no time for themself & you are complaining because they shouldn\u2019t be complaining. Why? Is it possible you\u2019re both doing too much? Maybe what you both need is recognize you\u2019re both stressed & taking that out on each other won\u2019t help. Take a day to do what you both want to do. Go to party & let spouse rest. Everyone wins.
