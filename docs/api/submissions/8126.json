With 3 kids under the age of 5? \n\nSeriously, you\u2019re barely an adult and you were, what? 18 or 19 marrying a dude in his 30s?

If this was an isolated event, you should have been accommodating, but seems to be boundary stomping, and a problem MIL. OP has to clarify this. Have you talked to her about this earlier??", "NTA.  It\u2019s seriously overstepping to show up to a birthday party with a cake, especially when you knew full well that a cake was already there.  It would be like showing up to Thanksgiving at her house with an extra Turkey.  If she has such a strong desire to contribute to the menu then she could discuss that with you both well before the party, and I\u2019m sure you can come up with a mutually agreed upon dish that she could bring.", "NTA\n\nI can sympathise - my wife's MIL is a bit like this.\n\nYou told your MIL that you were doing the cake. She tried to overshadow what you had done. It seems like it wasn't about her doing something nice for you but really for her own ego.

That\u2019s fine, be upset that she\u2019s pushy with the grandkids. But making this about \u201cruining the theme\u201d is pretty absurd when it\u2019s clear that you just didn\u2019t want her overstepping what you determined her role to be.", "NTA\n\nShe overstepped her boundaries.  This was a party for your daughter, and you are 100% correct that a 3 year old can focus on the smallest details.  The style of the cake might not be important to an adult, but 3 year olds have a much smaller view of the world. \n\nYou made the right decision and I would have done the same thing.  If you're MIL really wanted to bake a cake for her granddaughter she could have invited you all over for a smaller family gathering.", "Nta.

You are her parents. Your daughter has the right to have the cake she selected and you purchased as her birthday cake. \n\nBut... would a 3 year old have noticed the non-matching decor or just approved of extra cake? Of course you can't just ignore your MIL's antics if it is an ongoing regular problem, but I could see people being dismissive if you just tell them you are against extra cake.\n\nIf your MIL's problem is that she wants to be too involved, she wants to play parent, she has so much interest in being part of everything - maybe there is an answer to your problem. At least in the USA, there are many areas where the supply of good foster homes is far below what is needed. Perhaps your MIL could take on the role of temporary parent and help some kids who desperately need a safe refuge.", "Did. Did you say a cake would ruin the theme of a three year olds bday party. ETA.", "NTA - and something about the way you wrote your post gives me the feeling that you are a very patient person. I really love that you asserted a boundary with MIL even though it might have seemed easier not to. Keep doing it.

You are young to have 3 children under age 5, so good for you & I wish you well.  Your MIL needs to learn you have things under control & you don\u2019t need her help unless you ask. \n\nYou need to continue upholding general boundaries because she sounds difficult to deal with.

It\u2019s wrong, and it needs to stop.", "For most people it depends on when the age difference happens. An 18 year old is barely an adult with NO life experience, likely little independence (just beginning to build it) and relatively easy to groom (brain still developing, less firmly established opinions and the like). But someone just a few years older is in a completely different stage of their lives and so a difference in age becomes something that may or may not be your thing, but it\u2019s not inherently problematic. Like, a 30-year-old dating someone in their forties or even fifties is fine.", "I would assume op would know if it would set off her child or not. Nobody knows that except the parents of the child. I don\u2019t think I know anyone who\u2019d cry over more cake, but hey.

The young one has zero career or financial asses to speak of and is often left high and dry.", "Adults are just as irrational. It\u2019s cake, this is a dumbass post."]}
