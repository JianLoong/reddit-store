Ive been in a couple of them myself. I am a woman.  Without going into the details, the relationship I was in at 18 with a 29yo was problematic as hell and when things turned objectively abusive he would admit he specifically went for younger women because we were the only ones naive enough (not his exact words but if I quoted him I\u2019d be banned) to put up with his shit.

Whenever there\u2019s an age gap where the younger person is still a teenager it\u2019s super creepy. It happens to be more commonly women who are younger but I\u2019ve seen it the other way too. And the reason that it\u2019s creepy is that an 18 year old has almost no adult life experience, they are easily manipulated, they will have less money and can be financially manipulated as well. Once a person turns 20-21 it becomes at least a little bit better because they\u2019ve lived in the adult world for awhile and their brains are almost finished developing.", ".... 18 is a child still. It's nothing to do about being a woman and everything to do with the age. Sorry but your brain LITERALLY doesn't stop developing until 25. That means you're still able to be heavily influenced. Which is why older men pray on young girls - they can tell them 'oh, I'll take care of you financially, you can just be with the kids and keep up the house' which often in these relationships turns into financial abuse where the wife needs to ask for permission for every single purchase (sometimes getting shamed for it). It also allows them to act like 'they know more and are wiser' because of the age and assert their opinion and view on things on the younger person. By the time the partner shows their true colors, the other individual has 0 life experience that DOESN'T revolve around their (often controlling) partner.\n\nThe imbalance in the power dynamic and a full grown adult in their 30s dating someone that a year ago was still a high school student is the problem. Especially since girls that age think they're \"so mature\" and guys their age are just \"so immature\" so they think dating someone who's 30 is right for them without realizing how they're actually being manipulated and treated and dismissed. \n\nAnd men who pray on young women do that BECAUSE they can influence them easily and mold them to their desire. Either that OR they don't like women their age, which again could easily just mean that in 15 years you'll be served divorce papers and replaced for someone younger. \n\nEither way, there's LOTS of reasons why people don't condone these kinds of relationships. Good reasons.", "Grown women absolutely are capable of making their own decisions. 19 year old children are easily manipulated by 33 yr old adults who shouldn\u2019t have anything in common with a teenager and probably don\u2019t have their best interests at heart.

It\u2019s not infantilizing to say that she is now in a precarious position as she has 3 small children and is completely dependent on this man who could walk the second she no longer fits his desired type, which seems to be children.
