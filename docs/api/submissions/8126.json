It also allows them to act like 'they know more and are wiser' because of the age and assert their opinion and view on things on the younger person. By the time the partner shows their true colors, the other individual has 0 life experience that DOESN'T revolve around their (often controlling) partner.\n\nThe imbalance in the power dynamic and a full grown adult in their 30s dating someone that a year ago was still a high school student is the problem.

Either that OR they don't like women their age, which again could easily just mean that in 15 years you'll be served divorce papers and replaced for someone younger. \n\nEither way, there's LOTS of reasons why people don't condone these kinds of relationships.

Grooming is becoming more common in fraud, both online as well as in interpersonal interactions. What's more, scammers are getting more sophisticated in their techniques. There is a mistaken belief that scammers are forceful, arrogant, and therefore easy to spot, but many play a long game, carefully and patiently grooming the victim before asking for money. In some cases, they don\u2019t even ask for money. Instead, they carefully orchestrate events, sometimes using other actors to get the victim to offer help. This is a frequent occurrence in romance scams, but there are others, too. Financial and clairvoyant scams can also include a component of grooming, and this grooming serves a different purpose for different scams. Sometimes, it is to stop the victim from reporting the scam, and other times, it may be to facilitate long-term cooperation and financial abuse.\n\n[Source](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-grooming-techniques-in-fraud-what-to-watch-for-and-how-they-work)\n\n> Grooming: when an individual (groomer), or group of people (\u201cGrooming gangs\u201d), builds an emotional connection with someone they\u2019ve targeted to earn trust with the purpose of exploitation for their own motives: sexual abuse, financial, power kicks, even trafficking.\n\n[Source](https://caage.org/what-is-adult-grooming/)", "Yup.

I can't come up with the correct word. A few centuries ago, we were allowing children that are 12+ (aka as soon as you start menstruating) to get married, and have kids of their own, with adult men. As we've evolved as humans we've realized that is wrong and so that was increased to 18. What was the basis for that? You finish high school and can work. That doesn't make you a cognitive adult though and that was never taken into question when making this decision. I don't agree with a lot of things - being able to join the army at 18 being one of them - being allowed for teenagers. For me it's mind-blowing that the US allows someone to be a parent and marry a 30+ year old before they're allowed to legally drink. Make it make sense? Luckily the mindset of people is changing again and we can recognize grooming and abusive behavior that happens to teenagers (so 18) and obviously people are not happy about it.

Exactly because they can dominate them due to the disbalance of power/ability and manipulate them into what they want. Rich and poor has nothing to do with cognitive ability which is what we're talking about - and includes the different cognitive abilities of someone in their mid 20ties and someone in their late teens.

Why? Because the younger person doesn't know better and the older person really freaking should, after reaching 30 especially.\n\nIn terms of the last paragraph, you're right, that was definitely judgement.
