And she says that hurt her because she thinks it was possible to put hers on the side at least. I told her no because that could have ruined the theme of the party, and she got angry because she says that my daughter doesn't understand that and that I only decided not to use it because it looked horrible to me and that's not true. I think it was a beautiful cake but it did not go with the theme of the party.

You're saying she \"thinks she's the mother\" pretty confidently.", "Perhaps she doesn\u2019t take you seriously as a mom because you\u2019re a 23 year old married to a 37 year old? With 3 kids under the age of 5? \n\nSeriously, you\u2019re barely an adult and you were, what? 18 or 19 marrying a dude in his 30s? Clearly not the best decision maker. \n\nNTA for the cake thing, but you need to look at your life and choices so far.", "NTA. Talk to your spouse, too, because he should be defending you from his boundary-stomping mom.", "What's with all the MILs forcing cakes on people?\n\nNTA", "Looks like this is not a one off event, based on your comment. If this was an isolated event, you should have been accommodating, but seems to be boundary stomping, and a problem MIL. OP has to clarify this. Have you talked to her about this earlier??", "NTA.  It\u2019s seriously overstepping to show up to a birthday party with a cake, especially when you knew full well that a cake was already there.  It would be like showing up to Thanksgiving at her house with an extra Turkey.  If she has such a strong desire to contribute to the menu then she could discuss that with you both well before the party, and I\u2019m sure you can come up with a mutually agreed upon dish that she could bring.", "NTA\n\nI can sympathise - my wife's MIL is a bit like this.\n\nYou told your MIL that you were doing the cake. She tried to overshadow what you had done. It seems like it wasn't about her doing something nice for you but really for her own ego. It sounds like she pushed you and now thinks it was unfair of you to not allow yourself to be pushed.\n\nYour partner needs to support you here.", "Why would you care about ruining the theme of a birthday for your three year old when \u201cruining\u201d just meant putting an additional non-themed item on a table? \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have used the cake, but you talk about this woman who you claim is wonderful in a clearly somewhat resentful way for how pushy she is. That\u2019s fine, be upset that she\u2019s pushy with the grandkids. But making this about \u201cruining the theme\u201d is pretty absurd when it\u2019s clear that you just didn\u2019t want her overstepping what you determined her role to be.", "NTA\n\nShe overstepped her boundaries.  This was a party for your daughter, and you are 100% correct that a 3 year old can focus on the smallest details.  The style of the cake might not be important to an adult, but 3 year olds have a much smaller view of the world. \n\nYou made the right decision and I would have done the same thing.  If you're MIL really wanted to bake a cake for her granddaughter she could have invited you all over for a smaller family gathering.", "Nta.  She knew the cake was handled and did a passive aggressive stunt", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you need some boundaries, and maybe it\u2019s time to bring your partner into that discussion so he can be the one managing his mother and not you.", "NTA\n\nShe's your daughter. You are her parents. Your daughter has the right to have the cake she selected and you purchased as her birthday cake. \n\nBut... would a 3 year old have noticed the non-matching decor or just approved of extra cake? Of course you can't just ignore your MIL's antics if it is an ongoing regular problem, but I could see people being dismissive if you just tell them you are against extra cake.\n\nIf your MIL's problem is that she wants to be too involved, she wants to play parent, she has so much interest in being part of everything - maybe there is an answer to your problem. At least in the USA, there are many areas where the supply of good foster homes is far below what is needed. Perhaps your MIL could take on the role of temporary parent and help some kids who desperately need a safe refuge.", "Did. Did you say a cake would ruin the theme of a three year olds bday party. ETA.", "NTA - and something about the way you wrote your post gives me the feeling that you are a very patient person. I really love that you asserted a boundary with MIL even though it might have seemed easier not to. Keep doing it. She may eventually get the message, but even if she doesn\u2019t, your children will have no doubt about who their mother is and who really has their backs. <3", "NTA. She knew not to do that and chose to anyway, she doesn't get to be mad when you say that she can't override your work with her own. What does your husband have to say about this? Is he aware of the overstepping she does when she knows you've done something but she has to do it better?", "NTA - MIL over steps boundaries, everyone is not shocked.", "NTA.  You are young to have 3 children under age 5, so good for you & I wish you well.  Your MIL needs to learn you have things under control & you don\u2019t need her help unless you ask. \n\nYou need to continue upholding general boundaries because she sounds difficult to deal with.  She wasted $$ & stomped on a boundary you warned her about.", "YTA. It\u2019s a fucking cake. Why do you make mountains out of mole hills if you think she\u2019s the nicest person, give her some grace. Who hurt you?", "INFO you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole if her cake was the last straw, but on its own, your reaction might be a bit mom-zilla. What has led up to this?", "ESH. You sound as obnoxious as your mil. You\u2019re both making things about you. That party is more for you than your daughter. She won\u2019t remember it two weeks later. So she wouldn\u2019t have cared if there were two cakes. But YOU wanted it perfect the way you planned.\n\nYour mil is an asshole because she wanted to be the cake boss and be admired for her cake.\n\nAnd everyone sucks because I\u2019ve had trillions of birthdays and haven\u2019t seen a single cake for me.\nShit when I became my son and died for you, you made a holiday and gave gifts to each other and not one of you gave me a gift!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
