That date was this Saturday. Several of us live in a different state so we had to fly in. My sister didn't want to fly alone because she thought it would be hard to handle her daughter and their luggage. I'll add here that my niece is autistic and can be difficult at times. One of the things she does is wander or run off. So, she booked tickets for her and her 5 year old daughter on the same flight as me so I could handle the luggage. \n\nSo on Friday morning we went to the airport together. All thought security and while waiting in the boarding area my sister was entertaining her daughter with her phone. The phone ran out of power, so my sister tried charging it in one the airport outlets. It didn't work though. So she tried charging it using a power brick she brough. It still didn't charge. We thought maybe it was her power cord, so we tried mine and it still didn't work. I tried the outlet with my own phone and it worked fine, so we figured something was wrong with her phone. We only had a little longer till boarding so I let my niece watch cartoons on my phone.\n\nThen they started to call people for business class (where my seat was) so I got ready to board. My niece started to get upset. My sister asked to borrow my phone for the flight to entertain her daughter. I have private things on my phone though and letting them use it where I could not see made me uncomfortable. She then asked about borrowing my iPad. While I don't have much private information on my iPad I had work I needed to get done and had planned on using it to do work during the flight so I wouldn't get behind. I told her that the plane probably has screens on the seat.\n\nOnce I get on the plane I notice that it does not have screens built in. My sister notices too when she and my niece are boarding and she stops by my seat to ask for my phone again. I say no again and the people behind her rush her to move on so they could get to their seats. \n\nAfter the flight my sister looked stressed out and was very mad at me because her daughter had several outbursts and was very hard to deal with on the flight. I didn't notice because I had my headphones on the whole time. The relatives that picked us up noticed my sister was upset and asked what was wrong. My sister explained the situation and put the blame on me. I explained my side of it. They said it wasn't cool and I should have helped my sister out and that I probably made the flight worse for everyone.", "created_utc": 1676919027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117h2d6/aita_for_not_lending_my_phone_or_ipad_to_my_niece/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having a young, autistic child on a plane without the device that usually keeps her calm must have been extremely stressful for your sister, and probably pretty disruptive for other passengers. While you didn't owe your sister/niece your iPad, I think the kindest thing here would be to lend your iPad for the flight, if your work was not time sensitive. Maybe your work was time sensitive, or you were worried about your niece damaging your ipad, and that is fair also. I completely understand not sharing the phone to protect your privacy.

She\u2019s like that with everything, so it\u2019s extremely hard to predict what will keep her occupied. I\u2019ll be flying with her for the first time this summer.

Diapers, wipes, bottle, etc\u2026 all take up space too. I\u2019ll do my best, but kids that age are unpredictable, even if they\u2019re not autistic. Add in that they\u2019re on a plane in a very enclosed space, and I\u2019ve seen adults not cope very well. The mom isn\u2019t an AH for not being able to have everything she needed for her daughter.

Sister then tried her own cord in the power outlet and it worked fine, so they came to the conclusion that it was something with the phone. If I had a cord that I knew for a fact worked (as it clearly did for sister), but it wouldn\u2019t work for my phone on a portable charger or in the airport outlet, I\u2019d also reach the conclusion that something was wrong with my phone.

It\u2019s no OPs problem. The real problem here is the sister\u2019s entitlement. \n\nIf your kid is that problematic you need to have a plan C, D and E. Or just don\u2019t travel. Too bad. Putting the onus on others is not a solution.", "I have no idea what the mom\u2019s situation is, but I know for me personally, I don\u2019t have an old phone that works. I always either use them until they literally die beyond repair or I do the buy up program where you return the phone in order to be eligible. No tablet either as I\u2019ve never had need of one. I\u2019m friends with many, many parents, but I don\u2019t know any who carry an old phone."]}
