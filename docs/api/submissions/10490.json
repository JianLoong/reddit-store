That date was this Saturday. Several of us live in a different state so we had to fly in. My sister didn't want to fly alone because she thought it would be hard to handle her daughter and their luggage. I'll add here that my niece is autistic and can be difficult at times. One of the things she does is wander or run off. So, she booked tickets for her and her 5 year old daughter on the same flight as me so I could handle the luggage. \n\nSo on Friday morning we went to the airport together. All thought security and while waiting in the boarding area my sister was entertaining her daughter with her phone. The phone ran out of power, so my sister tried charging it in one the airport outlets. It didn't work though. So she tried charging it using a power brick she brough. It still didn't charge. We thought maybe it was her power cord, so we tried mine and it still didn't work. I tried the outlet with my own phone and it worked fine, so we figured something was wrong with her phone. We only had a little longer till boarding so I let my niece watch cartoons on my phone.\n\nThen they started to call people for business class (where my seat was) so I got ready to board. My niece started to get upset. My sister asked to borrow my phone for the flight to entertain her daughter. I have private things on my phone though and letting them use it where I could not see made me uncomfortable. She then asked about borrowing my iPad. While I don't have much private information on my iPad I had work I needed to get done and had planned on using it to do work during the flight so I wouldn't get behind. I told her that the plane probably has screens on the seat.\n\nOnce I get on the plane I notice that it does not have screens built in. My sister notices too when she and my niece are boarding and she stops by my seat to ask for my phone again. I say no again and the people behind her rush her to move on so they could get to their seats. \n\nAfter the flight my sister looked stressed out and was very mad at me because her daughter had several outbursts and was very hard to deal with on the flight. I didn't notice because I had my headphones on the whole time. The relatives that picked us up noticed my sister was upset and asked what was wrong. My sister explained the situation and put the blame on me. I explained my side of it. They said it wasn't cool and I should have helped my sister out and that I probably made the flight worse for everyone.", "created_utc": 1676919027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117h2d6/aita_for_not_lending_my_phone_or_ipad_to_my_niece/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
