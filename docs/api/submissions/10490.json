That date was this Saturday. Several of us live in a different state so we had to fly in. My sister didn't want to fly alone because she thought it would be hard to handle her daughter and their luggage. I'll add here that my niece is autistic and can be difficult at times. One of the things she does is wander or run off. So, she booked tickets for her and her 5 year old daughter on the same flight as me so I could handle the luggage. \n\nSo on Friday morning we went to the airport together. All thought security and while waiting in the boarding area my sister was entertaining her daughter with her phone. The phone ran out of power, so my sister tried charging it in one the airport outlets. It didn't work though. So she tried charging it using a power brick she brough. It still didn't charge. We thought maybe it was her power cord, so we tried mine and it still didn't work. I tried the outlet with my own phone and it worked fine, so we figured something was wrong with her phone. We only had a little longer till boarding so I let my niece watch cartoons on my phone.\n\nThen they started to call people for business class (where my seat was) so I got ready to board. My niece started to get upset. My sister asked to borrow my phone for the flight to entertain her daughter. I have private things on my phone though and letting them use it where I could not see made me uncomfortable. She then asked about borrowing my iPad. While I don't have much private information on my iPad I had work I needed to get done and had planned on using it to do work during the flight so I wouldn't get behind. I told her that the plane probably has screens on the seat.\n\nOnce I get on the plane I notice that it does not have screens built in. My sister notices too when she and my niece are boarding and she stops by my seat to ask for my phone again. I say no again and the people behind her rush her to move on so they could get to their seats. \n\nAfter the flight my sister looked stressed out and was very mad at me because her daughter had several outbursts and was very hard to deal with on the flight. I didn't notice because I had my headphones on the whole time. The relatives that picked us up noticed my sister was upset and asked what was wrong. My sister explained the situation and put the blame on me. I explained my side of it. They said it wasn't cool and I should have helped my sister out and that I probably made the flight worse for everyone.", "created_utc": 1676919027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117h2d6/aita_for_not_lending_my_phone_or_ipad_to_my_niece/", "score": 926, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree that the sub can be too individualistic but I\u2019m going off what op provided, and based on that I\u2019d say NTA", "YTA Still not sure why you wouldn't lend her your iPad? Why would you work during a flight and prioritize that?\n\nSure you're not obliged, but you could've been nice and helped your sister out a lot.", "\"I didn't notice because I had my headphones on the whole time.\"\n\nWell played!\n\nNTA", "The ipad might not have worked anyway because its for work so there might not be any games on it", "NTA\n\nShe tried but she didn\u2019t need to blame you. You were already doing a favor for her to handle luggage so she can focus on her daughter. What happened wasn\u2019t your fault and your items are to be used at your discretion. It\u2019s concerning electronics are the only thing to entertain her daughter. But if she is electronic dependent, she needs to invest in an old smart phone or iPad for her daughter. A mother with her child on a trip should not be without a phone for any reason. Yes she had charging sources, but she needs access to her phone and it needs to be charged and usable at any time. Her phone isn\u2019t a toy. So she should get her an electronic that\u2019s exclusively her daughters.", "NTA but check out \u2018guided access\u2019 on iOS devices for only allowing access to a single app/commands/areas of the screen. It\u2019s good to know about the feature in general, not that you have to share, but if you have to give someone your phone and don\u2019t want them to access anything else.", "NTA it's not your job to entertain her. There are also ways to keep children occupied that don't involve screens. They could have organised other things as a backup.", "NTA. I thought she was the parent.", "OP=NTA\n\nNope, I wouldn't allow use of my phone outside my presence.\n\nand the ipad-you were using it for work.  \n\nYour sister should have been better prepared for the trip.  And should have more behavior control options then a phone/screen.", "NTA\n\nWhat would your niece even have to do on your phone once you take off? I\u2019m assuming you have no games for children, and there is no internet to use youtube or netflix\u2026 unless your sister paid for in flight wifi", "Not gonna lie I laughed at this harder than I should\u2019ve but uh NTA", "Too bad for mom, she wasn\u2019t doubly prepared to entertain her daughter like you prepped entertainment for yourself. \n\nI have all the stuff on my phone, definitely would not hand my phone with a bunch of private info of mine to a child no less. NTA", "YTA. You just don't get it. \n\nYou could have helped, it would have made a world of a difference for her. It's not easy, it wasn't for a vacation.", "YTA \nEveryone saying she should have planned better sound like they don't actually understand that sometimes things don't go according to plan. She tried to charge her phone but it stopped working.", "YTA. Sorry, but you would have been mildly inconvenienced if you gave your iPad. Sometimes we do stuff for our family when they are struggling. Hopefully you don\u2019t find yourself in the same place in the future and she doesn\u2019t help you at all. Your sister surely knows now that she can\u2019t rely on you.", "You refused to give yourself a minor inconvenience for the well being of your disabled niece, to support your sister and for the comfort of the other passengers. \n\nYou were perfectly \u2018within your rights\u2019 to not give up your stuff but, in terms of being a decent human being, you hit a reef. YTA.", "Technically not your responsibility, but you lack emphaty to your niece who was stuck in a new and uncomfortable situation with lots of stimuly and no distraction and your sister who had to take care of her in that situation. So I'll still say YTA", ">\tWhy should you have to give up your stuff to entertain your sister\u2019s kid?\n\nBecause normal people with normal relationships tend to want to help those who are close to them and who they love. If my sister needed my help I\u2018d try to help her, as would she if the situation were reversed.", "probably because not everyone can afford it", "Your sister poor planing is not your issue", "But it seemed like it entertained her as long as it still had battery?", "And that is a good reason/excuse for blaming the brother?", "What was she planning on doing with your phone or iPad? Just guessing you don\u2019t have any children\u2019s apps or movies loaded.", "The mother should. OP doesn\u2019t need to do anythingz", "This here is the answer.  If this was my sibling or friend and I couldn't (for whatever reason) let the device out of my sight I would have offered to switch places at least for a bit to sit with the kid and device.  Or figure out how to lock things down.  Or something, anything other than to shrug and be like \"not my problem\".  Is OP obligated to do any of this? - absolutely not - but it is not the kind of relationship I would want to have with my family or friends, nor is it the kind of person I would want to be in this world", "No, the ass is the mom who uses electronics to babysit her kid and then allows her kid to throw fits when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants. The kid sounds like a brat because she\u2019s never told no.  OP is NTA. Not OP\u2019s kid, not OP\u2019s problem.", "This. And not saying the niece broke it but you want me to hand over my electronics after yours was returned broken? No thanks.", ">Phone is not a toy. Just because you made your phone into a toy for your child it doesn't mean that every other phone is also a toy and can be treated as such.\n\nYeah, this is what gets me. iPads are expensive and pretty fragile. I don't see it as the kind of thing you'd give to a young child. I don't use my iPad for important things but it's still something I'm very careful with.", "I'm an analyst, and there's no way I can do any kind of work other than answer emails on my phone. Ideal perfect world, I'm not doing work on my time off. Real world, deadlines don't shift around my time off. Flights are perfect for getting work done in relative peace. Even if I wasn't getting work done, I would never let someone borrow a device used for work, especially a child. I don't care if that child is screaming and crying at the top of their lungs for the entire flight, nope. I'm not risking the work I've done on my projects, not risking an email accidentally getting sent, and definitely not risking the tablet getting damaged/destroyed.", "Assuming you can afford to have multiple devices. Given OP is traveling alone, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to wonder if she\u2019s a single mom he can\u2019t afford 2 x $1000 phones or tablets.", "So you\u2019re saying you keep a back up phone at home, so if your phone broke, you could drive home and immediately have a new working phone?\nMy household income is 7x the US average yet I don\u2019t keep a spare iPhone at home. Maybe I\u2019m unprepared for life!!!", "You know they make phones and tablets cheaper than that, right? Like you can find kids tablets that are in the $100~200 range. You don\u2019t have to buy the latest thing from Apple especially not for a kid.", "We've got a spare phone sitting around at home. It's  an \"oh fuck\" stopgap cheap smartphone from Walmart, I think that was from when my screen shattered and I needed something in the interim. Kept the cheap phone for emergencies, and it's come in handy a few times. For something like $40, it can run basic apps like Waze, I can text and call. It's not winning any performance awards, but it's better than being stuck with nothing.", "NTA. You blessed everyone on that plane, especially your sister, with a growing experience. One of my absolutely favourite things on flights is children misbehaving, because I decided long ago I found them hilarious and not irritating.\n\nYour sister is going to have to learn to deal with her child and really, the child will also have to learn some level of self control. She's been using technology to enable her child and you did the right thing to deprive her of it. \n\nIf the rest of the people on the plane didn't want to be a part of this personal growth chance, they should have chosen to perish, for only in death does learning end.", "Leave them at home if they  can't behave. DUH.", "Coloring book or those etch a sketch things could\u2019ve been brought along. NTA. No batteries needed for those things.", "NTA - but maybe look in to getting niece (or even niece and sister) a cheap tablet so there's always a back-up device for niece if sister needs it? Amazon has the fire tablet that's basically marketed for kids and is usually under \u00a3/$100.", "NTA. I'd never let anyone walk off with my phone or iPad. Bloody expensive to replace and especially annoying if you have to work during the flight.", "YTA clearly she was prepared but her phone had a sudden problem. how long was this flight? I don't think you'd be that behind if you could just be separated from your ipad for that long.", "NYA. Poor kid is screen addicted.", "You don't have to give your property to a child just because your sister asked for it ( why didn't ur sister give her own phone to her child?..) She should have reserved some things to entertain her child in case the phone doesn't work (understandable why she didn't expect the phone to work but) It's unfair that she blames you (its most likely bc of stress but it's still very shitty thing to do), she shouldn't blame you when obviously this isn't ur fault, NTA.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t hand over my phone or iPad as they\u2019re linked so both have private content on there. Not selfish, if child saw something deemed inappropriate it would be a whole other argument\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s a no win situation\u2026 You still helped with the luggage and to made sure she didn\u2019t run off like your sister intended when she asked for help. Whomever doesn\u2019t like it can do something different the next time they all travel", "NTA it sounds like your sister would have been better off to have a babysitter for the day instead of forcing the girl into a plane. :(", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t she charge her phone or bring more things to entertain her daughter. I have no sympathy for the unprepared. She planned to fail and then made it OP\u2019s fault.", "I don't like sharing my electronic devices with kids because I can't stand them getting scratched or damaged, as I pay for them. \n\nI feel like I'm biased here, buy I still think your sister should be more understanding. I still don't understand why people let their devices drop to 0% charge, they can get their batteries bricked.", "NTA. I'm not a parent and I don't have experience with autistic kids so I don't know what your sister had to go through, but I have been in a position where I was asked to just give a kid ( in my case a 10yo cousin) my phone. I know exactly why you said no. There are so many private and inappropriate for small kids things in my phone and search history and most kids these days know exactly where to find them. The end result could be anything from embarrassment to leak of sensitive personal or work information to everyone blaming you for exposing the kid to inappropriate and/ or disturbing stuff. It's sad about your sister, but she is the parent.", "I mean, I\u2019m one of those \u2018you don\u2019t owe people anything\u2019 types, most of the time, but for the comfort of everyone else on that flight, I would have given her a device. And since this wasn\u2019t a result of poor planning, but an ill timed tech failure, I\u2019m leaning towards  YTA.", "Ummm... you definitely *can*.", "Tell your sister to buy an Amazon kids tablet  and habe it ready if her phone doesn't work.  Nta", "I mean, she's entitled to feel her feelings. But youre correct, her blaming her sibling out of hand for her discomfort is silly and a dick move. It doesnt appear like he was unduely criticized or punished though.", "She did have backups for her backups. Her child still wasn\u2019t entitled to his devices, though.", "The OP had already booked their ticket when their sister opted to be on the same flight to get OP's help with the luggage, not the niece.  If OP's help was volunteered or requested _for help with the niece_ and not to free up the sister's hands /attention so she could concentrate on the niece, I would then agree.   \n\n\n\nPresuming OP is there to help with everything and is already on the same page about what that means may be why their sister was so mad post flight.  They never had that discussion, though.", "How is OP the asshole?? She needed her phone bc there\u2019s private things in there and she needed her iPad to work?? Just because someone asks for something, regardless of who they are, they\u2019re not obligated to give up their personal items.", "Did you read OP\u2019s post? I did and noticed that he was using a work iPad. The vast majority of corporate devices aren\u2019t suitable for the hands of children. In fact, allowing a non-employee to use your corporate device is a firable offense at many companies. \n\nNTA", "Yeah, no one _needs_ to do anything for anyone else, but doing so anyway makes society run. Like Jesus Christ, someone just suggested OP do something nice for his niece and people pop on to remind him that he doesn't need to do a nice thing. Sure! He doesn't! He doesn't need to have a sister or a family or speak to anyone ever, but life would probably be miserable for him if he only did what's necessary to survive and nothing else.", "YES. I mean, I love my  niblings but I would never give them a fragile electronic device to play with! I've seen how badly kids trash phones/iPads etc. Their parents might be fine with their kids ruining their devices, but my money doesn't grow on a tree. I don't want to have to replace device because a kid broke it, even if I'm related to said kid. Plus what about all the important data in there that might be lost if it's broken?", "He doesn't even need to have something risqu\u00e9 on it. They can accidentally delete stuff he needs on his phone  for that reason alone I wouldn't let them have it .nta"]}
