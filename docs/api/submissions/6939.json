Sometimes the friendship became overwhelming but I usually made space for her.  I came to believe that we were like sisters. It's just that I found her intense and extremely needy. Some of my friends call her the female version of the \"cable guy\". \n\nHer communication style doesn't allow space for different opinions and she tends to talk over people in every conversation. This originated my decision to go NC for two years. Eventually, we reconnected but instead of engaging, she stays dead quiet in conversations and when I pause, she redirects the conversation back to herself. I came to the conclusion that since we've been friends for decades, I really didn't want to cut her off but rather understand that she's not perfect. I chose to create some boundaries, which worked really well.\nShe got engaged and since she's broke and her fiance's family didn't approve of the relationship, no one would be contributing to her wedding. Her family announced they wouldn't be attending.\nShe asked to use my family room as her wedding venue and I agreed. \nBecause my lease would end soon, I talked to the landlord so that I could pay on a weekly basis just to have the place available. I would pay one extra week after my lease expired so that she could have her wedding. We agreed that she wouldn't have more than 20 people over. \nI got sick with Covid and she disappeared on me. Her reaction was to ask me if the house would be disinfected and available for the wedding. She never showed concern about my health. I called her twice when I was really sick, and she was detached and clearly not paying attention to our conversation. She got triggered after I had to remind her that the 46 people she had invited weren't feasible and I couldn't get in trouble with the landlord. I reached out at a different time and when I told her how I felt, she said it was her moment to be finally happy and that she needed to be in the moment. \nHer decisions clashed with the rules. She completely ignored my concerns via texts and would reply \" there's nothing I can do\". \nMandy completely refused to reply to my messages for about three weeks. I decided the best I could to was move out as per my lease expiration and not pay the weekly fee. \nShe contacted me days before the wedding. Because I didn't answer, she blasted my phone off. Her fiance took a selfie in front of my gate so I called him back and said I no longer lived there and that Mandy would know had she not ignored all my attempts at reaching out. I heard nothing back from them.\nFast forward and I got an email from him. He apologized for her behavior and said they broke up because the wedding venue situation led him to understand that she only brings chaos into his life. He asked me.to respect his space and not reply. I destroyed her life and I feel horrible.

She's not a kind friend and apparently not a kind partner. Her \"finally get to be happy\" line tells me that she's been unhappy for a long time for reasons that have nothing to do with your situation.

You're the friend in this relationship, she is suffering from main character syndrome and everything needs to be about her. She isn't the female Cable Guy she is just a self centered person. You got sick, really sick, and she ignored you. She ignores what you say during conversation and redirects to herself. You already went NC because of her behavior. \n\nYou are worth more than this. This friend doesn't value you in the slightest and you are keeping them around because she has been in your life so long, but does she really enrich it? Is your life better with her?

All you did was give her ex enough breathing room to come up for air in that toxic mess. Don\u2019t feel bad, but do get yourself into counseling to work on boundaries and self worth.

That's not a 1 time thing and a slip of the tongue, that's someone who's beat down and worn out moving past it.
