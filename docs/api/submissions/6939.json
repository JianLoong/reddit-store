Sometimes the friendship became overwhelming but I usually made space for her.  I came to believe that we were like sisters. It's just that I found her intense and extremely needy. Some of my friends call her the female version of the \"cable guy\". \n\nHer communication style doesn't allow space for different opinions and she tends to talk over people in every conversation. This originated my decision to go NC for two years. Eventually, we reconnected but instead of engaging, she stays dead quiet in conversations and when I pause, she redirects the conversation back to herself. I came to the conclusion that since we've been friends for decades, I really didn't want to cut her off but rather understand that she's not perfect. I chose to create some boundaries, which worked really well.\nShe got engaged and since she's broke and her fiance's family didn't approve of the relationship, no one would be contributing to her wedding. Her family announced they wouldn't be attending.\nShe asked to use my family room as her wedding venue and I agreed. \nBecause my lease would end soon, I talked to the landlord so that I could pay on a weekly basis just to have the place available. I would pay one extra week after my lease expired so that she could have her wedding. We agreed that she wouldn't have more than 20 people over. \nI got sick with Covid and she disappeared on me. Her reaction was to ask me if the house would be disinfected and available for the wedding. She never showed concern about my health. I called her twice when I was really sick, and she was detached and clearly not paying attention to our conversation. She got triggered after I had to remind her that the 46 people she had invited weren't feasible and I couldn't get in trouble with the landlord. I reached out at a different time and when I told her how I felt, she said it was her moment to be finally happy and that she needed to be in the moment. \nHer decisions clashed with the rules. She completely ignored my concerns via texts and would reply \" there's nothing I can do\". \nMandy completely refused to reply to my messages for about three weeks. I decided the best I could to was move out as per my lease expiration and not pay the weekly fee. \nShe contacted me days before the wedding. Because I didn't answer, she blasted my phone off. Her fiance took a selfie in front of my gate so I called him back and said I no longer lived there and that Mandy would know had she not ignored all my attempts at reaching out. I heard nothing back from them.\nFast forward and I got an email from him. He apologized for her behavior and said they broke up because the wedding venue situation led him to understand that she only brings chaos into his life. He asked me.to respect his space and not reply. I destroyed her life and I feel horrible. All I wanted was to not be disrespected, but I wasn't trying to implode her relationship.", "created_utc": 1673306708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107tpxx/aita_for_cancelling_my_friends_wedding_to_be_held/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right the first time to go NC with her. You didn\u2019t ruin her relationship,she did. You should see it as saving her ex from living a horrible life. You see how emotionally draining she was to you, imagine how she acted with her ex. Don\u2019t feel bad, your friend isn\u2019t your friend. Cut her off forever. Quality over quantity .\n\nEdited for spelling mistakes", "NTA. You bent over backwards for her and she couldn't do the bare minimum IE. communicate with you. You didn't destroy her life, she did.\n\nHonestly, she sounds exhausting and I don't get what she brings to the friendship. I get that you've known each other a long time, but friendships don't last forever, sometimes they just end and you go your separate ways, and that's ok.", "> I destroyed her life and I feel horrible,\n\nYou did nothing of the sort. You're no asshole. Not even a little bit.  \n\n\nIt is sad to see this happening to two close friends though. I guess you were her friend more than she was yours.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t end their relationship. You called attention to a problem she refused to act while she gaslit her fianc\u00e9. If anything you did this guy a favour. Calling it off before the wedding sounds like the best move.", "NTA\n\nYou did not blow up Mandy\u2019s life. She was doing a fine job of that all by herself.\n\nMandy was not managing her affairs well, and she\u2019s totally self-absorbed. You tried to communicate with her, enforce your landlord\u2019s rules\u2014and even planned to pay a week of extra rent! She didn\u2019t keep in contact, didn\u2019t respond with any evidence of care when you let her know you were ill.\n\nIf Mandy had been generally kind, present, and responsible in her relationship with you, she\u2019d probably still have a venue. Knowing her behaviour, do you think she acted any better toward her ex-fianc\u00e9? People don\u2019t usually end otherwise good relationships over venue issues. Mandy\u2019s failure to secure your home as her venue was the last straw, not the first.", "NTA - she is a user of others. You did save her ex a lot of pain, so there is a silver lining.", "NTA.  You made yourself a priority versus a person who was using you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo friendship is one sided.  When a relationship does not have give and take, concern for the other's wellbeing, and a semblance of happiness toward the other person - its a parasite.   Your \"friend\" used you for what she could get from you, didn't care about you, your life, or your happines; and wanted only to speak about herself.  When used people realize they are being used, the cut ties.  You are not an AH for not prioritizing someone who doesn't prioritize you.  You are not an AH for not giving something to someone who is using you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not a person you should have in your life.  And HER actions, not yours, lead to her downfall.  Please don't gaslight yourself.  This is due to the consequences of HER actions, not yours.", "NTA. Nah she blew up her own life.", "NTA, play stupid games win stupid prizes. She should have just answered the phone and followed the rules, she caused all of her own issues.", "NTA - if everything here is true, your friend brought this all on herself", "NTA.  You did not implode her relationship, she did.  Had she rented a venue and attempted to bring more than double the approved number of people to the event, the venue would have denied them entry rather than risk violating fire code by that much, and he net result for her relationship would probably have been the same.  You tried to advise her, she declined to be advised.", "NTA. You went out of your way to extend your lease and host 20 people for a wedding in your home. But she's being entitled and selfish and completely ignoring your concerns.", "NTA. SHE 'destroyed' her life, not you, get that straight.", "NTA she created her own chaos.", "NTA. She ruined her own relationship, this was just the final straw for her ex fianc\u00e9. If their relationship was solid, they would have found a way to get married anyway. If anything, you saved them both from a nasty divorce. I know someone like your friend and her personality is why her marriage ended.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t destroy her life. She did\u2026. Move on and probably best to leave her in the past.", "NTA. You didn't destroy her life. She did that all on her own, and her ex could not put up with it anymore. Steer clear and oh how this post also belongs on some revenge site it's delicious. Hahaha.", "NTA.  I understand that it's her special day but she clearly ignored a well-established condition which she agreed to.  The fact that her fianc\u00e9 is walking away and that her family don't care for her tells me she must be a very difficult person to deal with.", "NTA I know you feel bad about the relationship ending but you've done the fiance a favour by letting him see her behaviour.\nShe could have replied to your messages and chose not to. That's on her so is her behaviour.", "NTA. Thank you for doing that for him before it was too late. She could have had it in a public park or something instead.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't destroy her life.  All of this happening was a direct consequence of Mandy's actions.  And you moving away saved that guy from marrying a really toxic person.", "NTA - You showed him a side of her that he wasn't aware of. That saved the both of them from a miserable marriage. \n\nThe one thing I'm concerned about is that you don't mention telling her at the point you didn't pay for the extra week. You should have given her those few extra days to find another venue.", "NTA- you let this go on wwaaaaaaayyyy too long. This person was never a friend to you. I know deep down some good part of you felt sorry for her or something but she just senses that and takes advantage. Think on the bright side; you saved this guy's life", "NTA...She was a bad friend! Good for you for putting yourself first!", "NTA \n\nYou have done absolutely nothing wrong. Your friend is, unfortunately, not a very good one. You have been exceedingly kind in your descriptions of her and your patience with her, which she is not deserving of. \n\nYou have excused so much negativity from her, to your own detriment, and she has not been able to reciprocate in even the smallest way. You should go no contact with her for good and remind yourself that you can't control other people and their reactions. You didn't cause a problem in her relationship, she did. Let her experience her consequences.", "NTA\n\nStop beating yourself up, you didn't destroy anyone's life. Mandy did it all by herself.", "I don't understand how you think you destroyed her life? Didn't her ex tell you that he noticed SHE brings chaos? Sounds like you actually did that guy a big favor! You're NTA and is you would have let her, she would have showed up with twice the allowed amount of people and left a mess for you to deal with!", "OP the simple fact that the fiancee's family wasn't going to attend because they have reservations about whom he was going to marry signals that the wedding venue debacle wasn't the first or only instance where Mandy was out of line.  OP didn't destroy her Life, she was already on that road before the wedding.  It's okay to not be on that road with her.", "Nta she did that to herself.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t destroy her life. She did that on her own.", "ESH for not cutting ties with her YEARS ago. You did not ruin her life, she ruined her own life with her selfish and destructive ways.", "ESH\n\nYou knew who she was before you agreed to provide the venue. Why say yes if you knew you weren't going to be okay with her pulling her typical bullshit? Or that she was likely to break or ignore rules?", "ESH.  She for obvious reasons, you for passive-aggressively stopping the rent and hiding from her instead of clearly telling her that you were cancelling.  You haven't imploded her relationship though - she did that all on her own by showing her fiance that she was a hot mess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
