You can't just threaten to report him for mutilation and child abuse, even if he threatened to go behind your back. That's not the same kind of threat. He threatened to do something to both of yours daughter that can be reversed by simply removing the earrings. You threatened to ruin his life by jailing him for child abuse. See the difference? Fathers have just as much right to their children as mothers. I'm not saying you think you're better, but it sounds a bit like you think it's your way or the highway, and that's not true, and threatening to ruin your husband's life by claiming child abuse is sickening and a huge red flag.\n\nHe's right, in my opinion, it's better to do it now while she's young. Earrings can be taken out and healed. It's not like he's asking to cut her arm off. Granted, it shouldn't happen unless you both agree, but to take it to child abuse is waaay too far for me.\n\nAlso, just because you're from the same country, doesn't necessarily mean you have the exact same culture. Australia is huge, and it's possible that it is a tradition in his family.", "You're both A-holes.\nThreatening to do it behind your back is definitely an a-hole move.\nThreatening to go over the cops and file charges for child abuse WAY more so. While waiting for your child to make their own choice about piercings is good and progressive, piercing a baby's ears is socially acceptable in many cultures, including Australia. That means it is not legal ground for claims of child abuse as far as I know, even if it was behind your back. If you got divorced right now and got equal shared custody and he got her ears pierced while it was her turn to have her you couldn't do anything about it legally, I don't think (not really familiar with Australian law).\n\n Honestly, going there could ruin the relationship. Which is fine but you claim to not want that.\n\nNow, aside from the piercing, if you think he's really sexist, I'd recommend keeping an eye on how he treats your daughter since other sexist treatment could easily qualify as abuse (and could be used in a custody battle or valid child abuse charges).\n\nBut if this is as \"abusive\" as he gets, as another poster mentioned, you could be ruining his life by making that kind of accusation if it ever came to light (without the pertinent details).\n\nAlso, if you accuse him of abuse over this, get told to seek couple's counseling, and then witness actual (as in actionable) abuse and try to report it,  they are less likely to believe you since you'll have a history of overreacting and \"being hysterical\" (I'm not accusing you of being hysterical, especially at the term is sexist, but it's very possible that a male dominated police force could see you as such).", "YTA - this isn\u2019t absue", "YTA while you should both agree, this is not child abuse", "YTA.

And if they are not cis, I hope they find support from friends, family or the community to be themselves.", "Until you get the law changed, this isn't legally defined as child abuse. So you are threatening to waste the polices time and I hope your country has laws to prosecute such false reports.\n\nYour views vs the law...please leave the police out of it. Parents can consent to ear piercing...the only thing you can do is try to get a court order interdicting him from piercing her ears (though I'm not saying it would be granted - never heard of it). \n\nBut why in the heavens are you threatening to make false reports based on your views, not the law? What are you saying?!", "Abuse has specific legal definitions. Getting something done that a parent is legally allowed to do is not abuse", "Legally he does.

However, I was not aware ears do not always close. I guess I never really thought about it. In *most* cases, they do. I'm pretty sure. \n\nWhen women pull this obnoxious bullshit of false reporting or threatening to false report in order to get their way, they cast that much more doubt on ***real*** reports of abuse. More importantly, they may also severely damage their children in the doing. \n\nMy mom toyed with this shit during divorce proceedings with my father and put me through some serious psychological torture (through a trained psychologist, no less) to get me to \"confess\" to abuse that never happened. \n\nYou have no idea what its like for a 6 year old girl to sit in front of a stranger for several hours every week for three months, being told what sexual abuse is and did daddy ever do this to you, and did he ever do that to you, and no, its okay to tell the truth, no really, its okay to admit what he did. I had to watch videos about sexual abuse that were so explicit that they were nearly pornographic themselves. I knew more about sex by age 7 than my 11 year old brother. \n\nI was a child who loved to please people, one who wanted to be loved, and it was only because I was smart enough to know that this was important, like, really *really* important... that I needed to tell the truth no matter what. I held out. I could have given in and lied, but I held out. \n\nI still love my mother, but I can never completely forgive her for that. She doesn't even know I still hold resentment over it. My dad was a good man and never abused me. Our landlord, a creepy old man who lived next door, might have, but I can't be sure any more. They weren't interested in hearing about *that*. I can no longer remember if abuse *actually* happened, or if my mind has false memories from those videos or the interrogations. \n\nEither way, I was more damaged by the investigation than by any actual abuse.\n\nSigh. Sorry for the rant, I really needed to get that out, I guess. ANYWAY....\n\nOP does not really see ear piercing as abuse, since she would have no objection to if if \"baby was ready\" IE, if their daughter said she wanted it. \n\nWhich I doubt she would consent to, if it was female circumcision or a beating.\n\nI think its super shitty of dad to threaten to do it behind her back, but I think the false abuse claim is significantly worse.", ">But don't let that stop your \"female making false report ruining man's life\" narrative.\n\nRidiculous leap substantiated by what? Making false reports is wrong no matter who does it. Very strange to add gender politics to my saying something is wrong. I'm female and a mother...I still don't think going to the police to report something which is not against the law is correct. Sorry if OP being female is supposed to sway my opinion.\n\nI never understand people who take you disagreeing with them to mean they know your views on subjects like child abuse, feminism, so called misandry etc. - could it not just be that I disagree with you and OP? \n\n>Legality is not the definitive definition of abuse.\n\nIt is the definitive definition of a crime which is what OP intends to report. Or did I miss the part where OP said she would - \n\nreport to social workers, involve child welfare or the equivalent in her country, leave the father and fight for custody, approach a court for an order interdicting or prohibiting him from piercing her daughter's ears or any other legal remedy open to her -\n\nIf it was a crime in her country then that would be different. In that case,I'd say open a case against him and whoever did the piercing for good measure.\n\nOP has avenues she can pursue if she believes this is child abuse - other than laying false charges.\n\nGoing to a police station  to lay a charge of child abuse is threatening to ruin his life because she has any reasonable avenues open to her to investigate child abuse claims (by mandated reporters BTW who would have to report any actual crime.\n\nOP is threatening the nuclear option to keep baby daddy in line instead of taking steps to actually protect her child...ie leave him and approach court for a custody arrangement which prohibits non emergency medical procedures including piercings without consent from both parents.\n\nChild abuse claims which are founded in opinions instead of law ruin lives of fathers,mothers, grandparents and any number of people without actually protecting children because if the police find no evidence of a crime, what have you actually done to protect the child?", "Dude get a therapist. This is not the place to trauma dump.", ">Making false reports is wrong no matter who does it.\n\nIf you're not going to bother to read the part where I clarify how it's not a false report, then I'm not going to bother to read the rest of your inane monologue."]}
