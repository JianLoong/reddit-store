You can't just threaten to report him for mutilation and child abuse, even if he threatened to go behind your back. That's not the same kind of threat. He threatened to do something to both of yours daughter that can be reversed by simply removing the earrings. You threatened to ruin his life by jailing him for child abuse. See the difference? Fathers have just as much right to their children as mothers. I'm not saying you think you're better, but it sounds a bit like you think it's your way or the highway, and that's not true, and threatening to ruin your husband's life by claiming child abuse is sickening and a huge red flag.\n\nHe's right, in my opinion, it's better to do it now while she's young. Earrings can be taken out and healed. It's not like he's asking to cut her arm off. Granted, it shouldn't happen unless you both agree, but to take it to child abuse is waaay too far for me.\n\nAlso, just because you're from the same country, doesn't necessarily mean you have the exact same culture. Australia is huge, and it's possible that it is a tradition in his family.", "You're both A-holes.\nThreatening to do it behind your back is definitely an a-hole move.\nThreatening to go over the cops and file charges for child abuse WAY more so. While waiting for your child to make their own choice about piercings is good and progressive, piercing a baby's ears is socially acceptable in many cultures, including Australia. That means it is not legal ground for claims of child abuse as far as I know, even if it was behind your back. If you got divorced right now and got equal shared custody and he got her ears pierced while it was her turn to have her you couldn't do anything about it legally, I don't think (not really familiar with Australian law).\n\n Honestly, going there could ruin the relationship. Which is fine but you claim to not want that.\n\nNow, aside from the piercing, if you think he's really sexist, I'd recommend keeping an eye on how he treats your daughter since other sexist treatment could easily qualify as abuse (and could be used in a custody battle or valid child abuse charges).\n\nBut if this is as \"abusive\" as he gets, as another poster mentioned, you could be ruining his life by making that kind of accusation if it ever came to light (without the pertinent details).\n\nAlso, if you accuse him of abuse over this, get told to seek couple's counseling, and then witness actual (as in actionable) abuse and try to report it,  they are less likely to believe you since you'll have a history of overreacting and \"being hysterical\" (I'm not accusing you of being hysterical, especially as the term is sexist, but it's very possible that a male dominated police force could see you as such).", "YTA - this isn\u2019t absue", "YTA while you should both agree, this is not child abuse", "YTA. Child abuse over her ears being pierced?", "NTA, but I don't think the police will take you seriously.", "Maybe Australia has weird laws but I don\u2019t see how a parent having their child\u2019s ears pierced is even vaguely child abuse. Sure, ear piercings for a toddler is weird.
