Dismissed her online class as \"not taxing,\"\n2. Ignored that half an hour break in a 13 hour day is pretty much not a break.\n3. Wanted her to start cleaning on her own at 10PM FOR TWO HOURS.\n4. Threw a tantrum like a toddler.\n5. Doubled down on that tantrum the next morning.\n\nand\n\n6) The result of that tantrum was that she went, alone, on a break that was supposed to reset the intimacy in your marriage after a rough spot.\n\nShe'd be lucky, and much happier, if she makes the decision to leave you.\n\nEdit: forgot to add judgement: YTA\n\nSecond edit: Thanks for the award, anonymous friend!", "\" I HATE COMING BACK FROM VACATION TO A DIRTY HOUSE.\"\n\nTHEN CLEAN THE HOUSE. \n\nIt's not rocket science. \n\nAlso its just a weekend and as you said things were going not so great in the marriage for a few months. And you choose to fight over cleaning.\n\nEdit to vote: YTA", "YTA. \nYou seriously ruined valuable time with your WIFE, because of a messy house? \nHousework could have waited. You realize you just put the importance of housework above the importance of your marriage right? You say the last few months haven\u2019t been great, yet you pull this? \n\nOof.", "Well. I hope you cleaned the damned house during your weekend. Alone. After all, you do so hate coming home to a messy house. YTA", "INFO...If you work West Coast hours, didn't you have all morning to clean? How long did you work that day?", "YTA. This was a chance to spend quality time with your wife when you know you\u2019ve had rough times and just because you didn\u2019t want to come home to a dirty house (what would happen? As long as the dishes are done that\u2019s really all that is an issue; sure clutter is a downer but it\u2019s not the end of the world) you threw a tantrum and chose not to join your wife. You sound like you\u2019re too busy marking points in a column for who is busier than focusing on enjoying a trip together.", "YTA\n\nYou sound insufferable", "YTA, why did you call your parents and alert them to this? First red flag. The comment you made about her taking a 30 minute break is an odd detail, doesn't help your argument, and suggests you have other resentments around how she spends her time. You don't sound like you understand the difference between your own preferences (clean house after vacation) and her obligations (to do chores to make you comfortable). There's a good chance she may have helped if you worded it differently. You cancelled a much-needed vacation at the last minute for petty reasons and at no point does it sound like you were doing anything for the greater good of the relationship.", "So she worked 9-10pm..... Whilst you worked 8 hours on a different timezone setting..... YOU could have cleaned the house in the morning before you started work, but I guess that wouldve inconvenienced your sleep.  \n\n\nYTA, lets hope she divorces and takes you to the cleaners. You have no respect for her and youre a clueless asshat.", "I hope you used the weekend to clean the house.\n\nYTA", ">Is my wife going to leave me.\n\nWell if she doesn't, consider yourself really really lucky. The bar is real low if she decides to stay. \n\n\n>She suggested that we go away for the weekend and we booked a weekend break in Amsterdam. \n\nAlmost feels like you didn't like the fact that this was your wife's suggestion and you had to make arrangements to do the same. So you just tried to ruin it for her as well. Whether this was unintentional or malicious I don't know. \n\nWhy didn't you suggest an alternative..? \n1. Hire someone to come do it on the days you're away. \n2. You do the cleaning alone and ask her to pack for you too.  (She's driving and needs the extra sleep)\n3. Let her sleep. You do half or so of the cleaning and ask her to wake up a little earlier to get the rest done. (You don't mention how big the house is. If it's an apartment for two, one person should be able to clean it by themselves. If it's a house with many rooms that's a different question)\nOr above all else\n**4. Compromise**\nThe trip had been planned for a while. Why didn't you plan the cleaning ahead too..? Do little by little everyday.. it's only a weekend trip, not like packing can absolutely destroy the cleanliness.. \n\n>Things have not been so great the last week months.\n\nAnd you picked YOUR needs of a clean house above making your MARRIAGE work. I mean, you don't mention kids, and you're both adults. How dirty can a house with just 2 adults be..? What do you clean once a month alone..? Generally if you pick up after yourself on a regular/daily basis, your house will be clean enough to leave for the weekend. \n\n>So not that taxing and she didn't need to leave the house to go. \n\nAnd here's the reason why your marriage is on the rocks. Stop looking down on your wife and the things she does. Don't make plans for her. Make plans *WITH* her. Be it cleaning or what not. \n\n>My mom and dad think I was right not to go. But\n\n2 days and you're already blame shifting and getting people on \"your side\" as against your wife. You're being a really shitty partner now and hopefully time away from you has helped your wife see that. \n\nDefinitely YTA. And if she decides to stay, do something big to make it upto her. She deserves that much at least.", "YTA - you essentially told her the neatness of your house (while you aren't even in it) is more important than your marriage.", "YTA. She\u2019s right, it could have waited. Instead you chose to throw a fit because she didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of her night cleaning, belittled the work she does AND acted like a child by refusing to go. I seriously hope she took the weekend to realize she\u2019s better without you. \n\nI\u2019m a stay at home mom. In your eyes, I\u2019d be \u201cdoing nothing\u201d. I did online schooling \u201cfreedom\u201d or not she still spent hours upon hours at a desk AH and that IS exhausting regardless of what you think. \n\nLearn some respect and either value your woman or you absolutely deserve to lose her. If I was her, I wouldn\u2019t be coming home except to get my things and leave again. There\u2019s been issues for months and THIS is how you choose to spend your vacation? Not the brightest choice for keeping a marriage going :/", "YTA. She is and she should. Others have said it better but you are rude and dismissive of your wife.", "YTA. Was having a clean house more important than taking care of your marriage? You mentioned that it hasn't been great the past months, I'm guessing the trip was also meant for the two of you to have a bonding moment again. Making this trip something more than just a fun trip; it was a chance for the two of you to choose for each other and making things work.\n\nI'm guessing emotions of the past months got the better of you. Still, going for YTA since it seems like a needless fight and because you choose housework over your relationship.\n\nAlso, if you're the one having a problem with coming home to a dirty house, it is up to you to take care of that, and up to your wife whether or not to help. Especially now, with how things are going.", "YTA.  Instead of enjoying the vacation, and reconnecting you decided to throw your toys out of the pram.\n\nIf cleaning was so important why leave it until the last minute? Why not agree to pack the day before?\n\nYou didn't agree a plan upfront, it was too late to do anything.\n\nShe is finishing at 10, still needs to pack and then has to get up at 6.", "I\u2019m guessing she HATES COMING HOME FROM VACATION TO A HOUSE FULL OF AN AH.\n\nShe\u2019ll dump you - sooner or later. YTA", "Your wife seems to be trying to work on your marriage.\n\nYou seem to find more joy in demeaning her and pouting.\n\nYes, she should leave you if you refuse to put work into the relationship, if you think she does nothing important all day long. \n\n**OP, can you list five things you like about your wife?**", "YTA   You are childish and petty.   \n\n>letting my wife go on a weekend break alone  \n\nLetting her?    \n\n***She might decide that she enjoyed going without you.   It's something to think about.***", "I'm surprised she's been texting back and forth - for me, especially if we'd been having trouble before, that would likely be the end of it (unless we had children then I'd probably try again)\n\nWhat state was the house in?  \n\nYTA because you don't seem to think much of her at all, you downplay what she does and think her work doesn't count (and that a 30 minute break between work ending and course starting counts as free time) - but yours which is online as well, clearly does matter", "YTA, how could you not even think this?\n\n\u201cI HATE COMING BACK FROM VACATION TO A DIRTY HOUSE\u201d \n\nAll your anger issues not hers.\n\nI can see why things haven\u2019t been great recently. \nMaybe get a better attitude, yours sucks.", "You were supposed to be going on holiday together and you refused because you told you she was too tired to clean the house. Fine, you have your views on housework but you missed out on a holiday because of it. Was it really worth it?", "If I were your wife. I would come home and throw you crap on the lawn.", "YTA Really?  How old are the pair of you. You are acting like a toddler throwing a tantrum.  You gave her an ultimatum-help clean or you wouldn\u2019t go away on the holiday.  When she wouldn\u2019t cater to your demands, you slept in another room and refused to go on your holiday.  Are you happy with yourself?  Was the house in such a state that cleaning couldn\u2019t wait until you got back. I really don\u2019t see the point of your little tantrum other than to insist she do what you demand of her and when she didn\u2019t, you punished her by not going to Amsterdam. Guess what, she wasn\u2019t punished-she went on the holiday.  You only punished yourself.", "Are you 5? It\u2019s no wonder you have issues in your marriage when you treat your wife like she doesn\u2019t matter. You are dismissive of her job and her classes. You expect her to run around after you. \n\nGood luck to your wife, divorce is a hard process and it sounds like she has been living in a hard situation for a while. At least she will have light at the end of the tunnel though.\n\nYTA", ">Is my wife going to leave me.\n\nA little too late to care now, huh? \n\nYou can't be a complete asshole to her and then be all shocked when she is sick of being treated so poorly. \n\nAnd honestly a vacation away from you is exactly what she needed to get her head on straight. It was probably the dumbest move you could have probably ever done letting her go by herself. Now she knows being by herself, taking trips by herself, is far more enjoyable than arguing with you every step of the way. Most people stay in bad relationships because they're afraid of being single. She's just got to learn being single is fun and freeing.\n\n>I work for an American company on West coast hours. So finish work a lot later then her. But I was able to make arangements to finish early on Thursday.\n\nWhat the fuck are you doing with your extra time? You said you had a shorter day than normal, and you also start later in the day. She still had her full-time job plus her class. Why in the world did you wait until she was done to START cleaning? Why not before work? Why not the fucking day before? \n\n>I told her that was not ok, that we both had to clean up. That she should start, and that when I finished in two hours I would help her finish off cleaning the house.\n\nSo it's okay for her to clean by herself after a completely booked day of work and school, But you couldn't have started before? \n\n>I told her, I didn't think it was fair that I would have to clean the house on my own. She shot back that I shouldnt and that it would be fine when we got back. I HATE COMING BACK FROM VACATION TO A DIRTY HOUSE. \n\nHow fucking dirty is your house? Is it just her cleaning all the time? There's two of y'all in the house. And this is a trip you both knew was coming. Unless you literally had rotting food left on the counter, and shit stains in your toilet, what exactly were you cleaning so desperately the night before? Was it just clothes and vacuuming that needed to be done? \n\nAnd if it's a you thing where you need the house to be spotless when coming back from vacation, maybe don't do all the cleaning the night before????\n\n\n>My mom and dad think I was right not to go. \n\nYOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS? \n\nBefore even having a proper conversation with your wife?????\n\nAnd now you're on here quoting them like they're an unbiased source?

I surely wouldn\u2019t be.", "YTA. \n\nYou overreacted and ruined a chance to reconnect with your wife over a minor issue. You could have cleaned the house together when you got back, or hired a cleaner, or just let it go for a few days.\n\nYou also work from home, so you have more flexibility and less stress than your wife who has to commute and take classes. You should have been more understanding and supportive of her.", "YTA. It\u2019s all about what YOU want.", "YTA,\nYou decided to not go on vacation because she wouldn\u2019t clean the house.

Next time just get a cleaning service as part of your vacation.", "YTA and I certainly hope she leaves.", "YTA. OP, hope the clean house was worth it. She deserves so much better.\n\nAnyone else here listen to the Jolly Good Ginger Guy on TikTok? I keep thinking that our wife should divorce this guy asap. Just me?", "Yta. The marriage is over.", "If you wanted the house cleaned, you shouldn\u2019t have waited until the day before you leave to clean it. The purpose of the trip was to spend time with your wife.

Please get help and I hope your wife wakes up and leaves you if this is how you treat her.", "YTA. It's a weekend trip, your house won't go into ruin just because it hadn't been cleaned before leaving for your trip. Cancelling your ticket as what, some kind of payback? \n\nYou dismissing her online classes and calling it not taxing omg. I had to spend 2 years of uni online and it was just as tiring if not more tiring than in person classes.", "INFO: I\u2019m confused. Why couldn\u2019t she pack then when you were done 2 hours later could you both not clean together? I\u2019m not clear on why she had to clean at that moment. How dirty is your house that if she starts two hours before you, you still have hours worth of cleaning to do? Like do the dishes, take out the trash, and be set enough to go. Also, what happened a few months ago that is causing all of this? You both seem very annoyed at each other and I get the feeling it\u2019s because you are both home all day in each other\u2019s face. It seems like you just wanted to be home alone without her there and found an excuse to do it. Is working from home for you both a new thing? Also, all that bitching about a dirty house, I hope you cleaned instead of sitting around while she was gone.", "She definitely *should* leave you.

If you want bit clean so bad you clean it. She wants to be prepared and packed and she is an adult and can make that decision. She is tired. I wouldn't want to finish work and class and then clean knowing I need to pack to drive in 8 hours. Shouldn't she be well rested. And you seem controlling. Who are you to tell her what not to do and what to do? You showed her that having your way is more important than rekindling your marriage....more important than her. I hope she does leave you. YTA", "YTA. So petty, I\u2019d go without you too.  I also don\u2019t  Like to leave for vacation with a dirty home but I plan in advance, one week, to clean   so I\u2019m not stressed when I leave. You need to treat you wife better and clean well in advance.", "YTA. Your wife has the patience of an absolute saint. I would have been phoning attorneys in the same room as you the moment you demanded she clean at 10pm, while YOU had slept in all morning. After she worked ALL day! \n\nI hope she's calling right now. You had one, last chance. You blew it.", "YTA and it seems clear why your marriage has issues. I like coming back to a clean house from holiday too but was it really that essential? How much even needed done?", "YTA, you sound like you think you are right and everyone else who doesn't agree with you is wrong. That kind of rigid and self-centered thinking doesn't work in a relationship that is an equal partnership. That's my mature and respectful response. \n\nMy not-so mature and respectful response is: you threw a massive pity party and as a result, your wife went on a couple's passion-rekindling trip to Amsterdam. All by herself. You dumb.", "YTA.  I could not have said it better than others have, but I will add this: it sounds like you are choosing your stubbornness and ego over your already-fragile relationship.  I hope it\u2019s worth losing your wife over.", "YTA.  Massively.  Your belief that your cleaning schedule is the only right one doesn\u2019t require everyone else to follow it.  Her suggestion to make an exception when she had a horribly long day and was getting ready for vacation was entirely reasonable.  I\u2019m glad she went.", "Fingers crossed your wife does leave you.

She should leave you", ">She said she was tired and had been in front of her desk for 13 hours. *This is a lie, she had a half hour break between 5:30 and 6.* She also has a lot of freedom from her job and constantly leaves her pc for 20 and 30 minutes during the day. \n\nI mean, technically it could be even less if she had a chair that turns away.

I would suggest marriage counseling where you discuss the issues and try to compromise. I thing marriage will only work when you can be honest and both compromise. Maybe consider not being so rigid.", "YTA it sounds to me like you wanted there to be a problem so you wouldn\u2019t have to go on the trip with her which makes me think you don\u2019t want to rebuild your relationship with her.

Things have not been so great the last week months.\n\nShe suggested that we go away for the weekend and we booked a weekend break in Amsterdam. We both live in Bath. So not a long flight for us.\n\nI work for an American company on West coast hours. So finish work a lot later then her. But I was able to make arangements to finish early on Thursday. Our flight was Friday morning.\n\nShe has class after work on Thursdays, it is an online course. So not that taxing and she didn't need to leave the house to go. She starts work at 9 am and finished at 5:30 PM. Her class runs from 6 pm until 10 pm. When she finished work she came into my office (I work from home as well). Told me she was going to pack as she had to get up at 6 the next morning to drive. \n\nI told her that was not ok, that we both had to clean up. That she should start, and that when I finished in two hours I would help her finish off cleaning the house. She said she was tired and had been in front of her desk for 13 hours. This is a lie, she had a half hour break between 5:30 and 6. She also has a lot of freedom from her job and constantly leaves her pc for 20 and 30 minutes during the day. \n\nI told her, I didn't think it was fair that I would have to clean the house on my own. She shot back that I shouldnt and that it would be fine when we got back. I HATE COMING BACK FROM VACATION TO A DIRTY HOUSE.  \n\nI told her, that is she wasn't willing to help me clean the house I wasn't going away in the morning. She said \"fine\" told me to \"You do you\". She packed her back and went to bed.\n\nI slept in the spare room and she woke me the next morning, asking where my bag was. I told her I hadn't packed and wasn't going anywhere. \n\nShe flies back tomorrow morning. We have been texting back and forth and she hasn't said anything about me not coming. My mom and dad think I was right not to go. But my best friend said I was being unreasonable. \n\nIs my wife going to leave me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for not going on a weekend break when my wife refused to help me clean the house?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Y\u2019all could have also hired a cleaner for the weekend to save you both time, but OP seemed to have wanted to  instigate a fight.", "Did you see the part where he\u2019s 50 YEARS OLD?", "Nah they left, remember? #brexitfail", "> These are not the actions of a man trying to save his marriage. \n\nThese are not the actions of a **MAN** at all. \ud83e\udd2e this guy is giving big baby energy while he's damn near old enough to receive senior discounts.", "Yeah well you equated the OP\u2019s wife to your friend and called him NTA based on that\u2026 so, save your eye rolls\u2026 clearly your comment is not being well received.", "I have a feeling she never gets to finish.", "Like excuse me sir, are you talking about a lunch break?? I don\u2019t get time to think on my lunch breaks, let alone actually consider it a break", "And she had to get up and drive them the next day too.", "This!!!!", "It\u2019s actually not reasonable or acceptable to talk negatively about your marriage to anyone, including parents and friends. Anyone who does this is the AH. You\u2019re supposed to have your spouse\u2019s back and not plant seeds of negativity about them in the minds of others.", "Yes. This was using cleaning as a form of control, 100%.", "Ty for that. Not OCD, but y\u2019all get misunderstood a lot.", ">And he demonstrated that he loves clean counters more than he loves his wife.\n\nBut not as much as he loves controlling his wife. After all, he didn't get up early to clean, and he didn't stay up late to clean.", "Do it your flipping self for crying out loud. Stop expecting your wife to do stuff *you* want done.", "SHE IS A HUMAN BEING WITH HER OWN FEELINGS, ENERGY LEVELS AND DESIRES, SHE IS NOT YOUR SLAVE TO BE DIRECTED TO DO WHATEVER YOU DESIRE WHENEVER YOU DESIRE! I want to smash my head through a brick wall just reading your complete lack of self awareness! Seriously, go and get checked for narcissistic personality disorder, your behavior IS NOT NORMAL OR HEALTHY! You are emotionally abusive. That is not hyperbole. You are abusing your wife, that you \u2018love\u2019 and you came here to get justification for your tantrum. When you didn\u2019t get it, you did exactly what a narc does and tried to get the others to explain why your behavior is wrong, over and over and over, until they get exhausted and give up, giving you your \u2018win\u2019. I cannot stress enough how much therapy you need, but I already know you will never seek it out because you don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve done anything wrong. \n\nIt is incredibly telling that she left without you and is not discussing that with you, she doesn\u2019t care that you aren\u2019t there. She has emotionally checked out. That is almost always the last step before a woman leaves. It is incredibly telling that she won\u2019t join finances with you, that is because she finds you financially irresponsible/abusive. Once again, she is not your slave, you don\u2019t get to dictate her every fucking move. You are not a man, nor a provider. You are a child throwing children tantrums and I cannot wait for her to leave your ass behind. Disgusting.", "She's your wife, not your subordinate. She has her own legitimate things going on.\n\nIf you want something done on your schedule, then do it yourself.", "Why didn\u2019t you just do it to start with? Don\u2019t give her a job, do it yourself.", "You're here arguing with reddit instead of being with your wife. You totally love her bro, we believe you...", "You had a chance to go away with her and chose to pout over a messy home instead. Is that love? It\u2019s not making her or your relationship a priority. Housework is more important to you.", "I'm tired of your crap and I've never met you and never will. \n\nYTA", "I know it wouldn\u2019t. And idc. \ud83d\ude02 I know I\u2019m being petty because what he said triggered me. About the wfh situation.

I am totally confused.", "\ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s really scary that OP doesn\u2019t seem to grasp this", "Awwww that's so nice of you! Thanks.", "I hope she had so much fun by herself that she falls back in love with who she gets to be without him.", "Honestly that\u2019s probably what happened.", "Our new patron saint. I love this choice. I haven\u2019t seen Barbie yet but I am beyond certain I\u2019m going to love it.", "How do you subscribe to this religion?", "I\u2019m down for Carrie Fisher as a god, sign me up!", "a friend literally just showed off her altar pics and one of the hearth deities on it was Carrie Fisher xD", "I want to join!", "...\n\n...\n\nis there a newsletter?", "So like\u2026 do we have an option for early or late services?
