It's a three-bedroom apartment opposite a park, and there's a farmer's market that's just five minutes walk away. I converted the smallest bedroom into an office and kept the second bedroom as a bedroom. I thought that if my parents decided to come here for a visit, they wouldn't have to stay in a hotel. \n\nI wouldn't be here without my parent's help. They financed my move and I'm paying them back by sending money home every month.  \n\nI did a complete makeover of the apartment when my housemate left. That housemate is a high school friend  I allowed to live with me. She moved here for work and I offered my apartment to share rent. However, she was a slob, sometimes \"forgot\" to pay her rent, and would get angry if I didn't clean her dishes or leave her my leftovers. We got along fine initially, but eventually, living with her became hell. I barely managed to kick her out. \n\nWhen I finished re-decorating my apartment, I sent photos back home, telling my parents  I was happy to be living in my apartment without a slob of a housemate. \n\nLast week, my mom called to say that her friend's daughter will also move here in a few months for work. They're looking for an apartment, but the daughter seems picky. My mom asked me if it was okay if the daughter could live in my apartment instead. I told her no, as I didn't want another slob of a housemate. She promised that her friend would be paying rent on time. Still, I said no. Then she tried to make me feel guilty by telling me that she already promised her friend my apartment. Later, I learned the name of my mom's friend. That friend has a daughter and a son. That daughter bullied me when we were kids. When we were back home as adults, she was cold to me and would always make me feel that she was inferior and better than me. I gave my mom a big no.\n\nThen she started her tirade about me being ungrateful and pointed out that since it's her money that I used to find the apartment, it's technically her paying the rent, and she is allowing the friend's daughter to live here. She said it with a tone that said I don't have the right to argue with her.\n\nI live in an exclusive building where the doorman won't allow anyone to enter unless the tenant or unit owner gives permission. My mom already gave my address to her friend so they can fix the daughter's paperwork for the move. She also showed the pictures I sent her, that the daughter loved my bedroom, and asked if we could switch. The nerve!\n\nI said if they continued their plans, I would tell the reception desk  I didn't know her, and that would be a legit reason for the building security to escort her out of the property.\n\nShe called me ungrateful again and hung up the phone. I'm contemplating moving and won't give my new address to them, but I don't want to leave this apartment because it's a good location.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1692695356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y07y0/aita_for_refusing_my_mothers_request_to_let_her/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And tell the doorman she\u2019s not allowed there. Pay your parents off quickly so they can\u2019t hold it over you.\n\nNTA", "Stay it\u2019s a good place. Tell your mom that her friends daughter bullied you in school and go into extreme detail about the worst thing she did to you and then point out to your mom it would ruin her relationship with her friend if her daughter ended up trashing the place because she wanted to continue bullying you.", "Don't ever give in to emotional blackmail. You stay, and you learn say to say no.", "Stop running. Do not allow yourself to be bullied out of your apartment. Stay where you are. Ask the landlord for permission to change the locks. Notify security. Live your life. \n\nMom will get over it or she won\u2019t (clue: she will after the initial embarrassment of overpromising to her friend wears off). \n\nNTA.", "Maybe the landlord has another unit open that he wouldn't mind you moving to so it could also be renovated. Is it your name or your mom's name on the lease?", "Don't move out, just give the daughters info to the security straight up. And maybe speak to your dad to deal with your mother. If you like your landlord and like the apart.ent don't let your mom's selfishness ruin it.", "Well how about you talk to the landlord and make sure your mother's words and wants don't trump yours? You're the one living there. If you ask nicely, maybe your landlord can even say *he* doesn't allow it.", "Wow, all of this sounds so familiar! \nI find it quite abusive seeing it from my white western upbringing. \nWholly agree that children do not ask to be born and in their choice of having children they should of course provide food, shelter etc. \n\nYour home is meant to be your sanctuary and bring you peace and joy. Don\u2019t let your happiness be threatened by this person who bullied you. Your house sounds cool, the location/cost sounds great but this person moving in will make it a prison and it will be ruined.", "Agree, but the mother doesn\u2019t sound like a rationale  discussion is going to change her mind", "Mom would probably excuse it as she was young and immature. Thing is mom is afraid of losing face for saying the girl can't move in with OP now. OP should just go ahead and tell security to not let her in. OP could look into getting a loan to pay her parents back in one lump sum now so mom can't hold it over her.", "Yep Pay back and go LC. What kinda parents intentionally try and hurt their own kids", "I love your idea!!\nThis poor girl!!\nI was thinking along the same thing. Pretend she moves to a studio apartment or something since even if she downsized to a one bedroom, her mom sees no reason her daughter can\u2019t let her bully have her daughter\u2019s bedroom because she loves how it was done. \nBut pics off the internet actually seem cool. I mean, technically she could move, but then one day her landlord calls to say yer apartment is available again and she \u201cmoves\u201d back. I mean crazier things have happened. \nTo think the money she sends back does not count as a thanks and here is your money back. That her mother thinks she has say as to who she has in her daughter\u2019s place. Wow!", "Nah. It's time for OP to be an adult and say no.", "'dont want her to stay' is not strong enough. The proper statement is 'no, she'will not be staying'. Wishy washy language gives people room to hear what they want.  If the answer is no don't dance around it, say no!  \"I would rather not\", \"it would be better if\" \"I don't think it is a good idea if\" all leave wiggle room.  \"No\" is not a bad word. If you mean no, say it!"]}
