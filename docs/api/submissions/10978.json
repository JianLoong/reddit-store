The first didn't go well. I still had a lot of walls up that didn't allow me to engage properly. I didn't get angry, I just didn't say much at all. My fianc\u00e9e told me what a lot had already assumed: she didn't feel like a priority, she was hurt by my comment and my actions. She gave me specifics on what needed to change if we were to continue. I told her I needed time, and she went back to the parent's house for the night. I took this night alone to truly think over the things she had requested (no more late night visits and other harsh boundaries being put into place) and tried to imagine a life where that happened.\n\nThe second conversation was much more impactful. I took feedback I was given here - which mainly centered around honesty and apologies. I told her that I was sorry for waking her up and for not treating her how a fianc\u00e9 should. I also told her I was sorry I hadn't been prioritizing her... but that I couldn't. At least not in the top, number one spot. The gist of my side was this: my life partner, in a lot of ways, has already been chosen. It might change in the future, but as of right now, my friendship is the most important relationship in my life. He isn't just *like* family to me, he *is* family to me. That goes beyond just the two of us: his little brother is my little brother. My mom and dad have all but officially adopted them into our family and vice versa. Our lives are intrinsically enmeshed and have been since we were 15. I had been doing a disservice to her by pretending that I could put anyone else over this familial unit that has already been built. \n\nThis conversation was difficult for us both. We cried together, we attempted to compromise, but the truth of it all boiled down to 'if he needs me, or even just wants me, I'm going to do everything reasonably in my power to be there.\" We again, took the night for ourselves to process.\n\nAnd that leads us to the final conversation, which was about our future. She told me she had known the end was coming and had begun to accept it long before our conversation. I agreed. We're also planning a 'move Jess out' party between just us two where we try to have fun with it and reconnect as friends. She told me, in customary break up fashion, that she's going to cut bangs in my bathroom at some point during this planned night. \n\nSo, was I the asshole for saying that my friend's trauma was more important than her comfort? Yeah. I was. Not only because it was harsh, but because I didn't say it sooner so she could make an informed decision about whether it was a life she wanted or not. Now she gets that. I feel gracious and humbled by her forgiveness and understanding, and thankful to commenters who provided insight.", "created_utc": 1677441743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cr1qf/update_aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9e_that_my/", "score": 113, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means. \r\n\r\nThe original had to be locked due to a large number of rule 1 violations.\r\n\r\nPlease remember the goal of this sub is for OP to take the feedback they received to resolve their conflict and learn from their experience.

I hope she finds whatever she desires and that this hasn\u2019t done irreparable damage to her ability to trust. Based on your comments, I would urge you to look into comphet.

I hope you and Nolan figure out the nature of your relationship and that you both bring each other great happiness. \n\nIf you ever propose to someone again, please make sure you mean it this time.  Saying you want to get married and spend your life with someone is one of the biggest commitments you could make.  It comes with some pretty clear priorities - that your spouse will be the most important person in your life, that you won't keep secrets that affect the other, that you treat them with respect and make them, and your life together, your number one priority. \n\nTo propose to someone when you have no intention of treating them this way is, quite frankly, cruel. Please don't treat someone like that again.", "Well, I\u2019m glad Jess made it out of this one. \n\nHow do you expect to build a family like your own parents did if you\u2019re still prioritizing your friend/\u201cpractically brothers\u201d/secret-gay-lover over your SO?", "I still think is an AH move to string along your ex-fianc\u00e9e for a year and a half, but I'm glad that both you got a satisfying conclusion.", "I'm glad your fiancee was finally able to see the authentic you, and is wisely moving on.

I hope one day you realize that. The codependency is unhealthy and blocked your relationship with her and you didn't care.

You just gave up your fianc\u00e9, a life partner, for someone who will one day find their own partner.

You\u2019re still a ridiculously major AH. Huge. And please don\u2019t ever get into another relationship until you\u2019re ready to put your partner first. Any person you\u2019re engaged to, married to, or even in a committed long term relationship should be your first priority after yourself.

It might change in the future, but as of right now, my friendship is the most important relationship in my life.

If nolan were the be all to you and you were fulfilled you would not have been in a relationship w your fiance' for years.\n\nYour original post mentioned the death of Nolan's parent and that your entire friend group has helped him through this.  \n\nIf the entire friend group is helping why all the late night visits to you?\n\nIf all your emotional needs are being met, why become involved with your fiance' to start with and why waste years of her life?\n\nSince it is common knowledge in the friend group, what nolan has gone through, why was he so adamant to keep private &  exclude your fiance from this knowledge? I believe nolan used and continues to use his parent's death as a device to selfishly  keep you close to him, and his refusal to allow you to share the full story with your fiance (altho it is no secret since everyone in the friend group knows) is a tactic to divide you & your fiance' .\n\nWhat you are saying doesnt add up, it doesnt have to, those of us who have read and commented on your post are internet strangers.  \n\nBut you have not said you are in love with nolan or physically or romantically attracted to him.\n\nSo i  hate to see you be manipulated into losing a relationship with your fiance' (or any future partner) because of nolan's loneliness & co-dependency.", "I'm so glad she is free to find a man who respects her.

What your fiance needed was practical and reasonable.

Will you be able to emotionally handle that?  The issue is, not only has Nolan become almost completely dependent on you, but it seems that you have also become completely dependent on being his emotional crutch.  I'm not sure you will be able to handle it, if a time comes where he starts to move on, gets into his own relationship, and maybe even starts a family with someone else.  Are you prepared for that possibility?", "I had you as NTA in the original post but after this update, I think I would change it.\n\nBut hey, at least you were honest with her and she can fund someone to prioritize her.", "Good for you and let this be a lesson.

As I mentioned to you before, the various kinds of attractions can and do exist separately. While I know nothing about the state of your sexual attraction, based on everything I have read, you sound like an asexual going through the sexual motions, except with romance instead. You act like how you think you should act but you don't really understand why you have to and you don't really want to. It's just not what you need.\n\nAgain, it's ok to develop a deep platonic relationship. If you're asexual and aromantic, it doesn't make you less of a man. I would look into it, especially if you choose to pursue a romantic relationship (some aroaces do) in the future. Or a sexual relationship with someone else.

I think the fact that her life was made collateral damage in your self-discovery journey is what people take issue with, not necessarily the end result of a non-traditional relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s also unclear what the rest of your social circle looks like, but dropping everything whenever your friend desires, allowing and enabling him to be disrespectful to other people in your life, and generally never holding him accountable for anything and finding a way to view everything thing he does in a favorable light does sound unhealthy.", "You literally broke up with your gf cause you refused to make her a priority in your life and set boundaries with your friend.

(Genuinely curious, not attacking)", "they are. until one of them gets interested in someone else and one of them gonna act like this again. they'd deserve it.", "I guess if that is truly the case and OP doesn\u2019t want to just say it, that does drastically change the situation.", "OP doesn't seem to have ever considered his relationship with his ex fiance as being particularly important, so to him I doubt he sees it as affecting an important relationship.", "There is only so much about my friendship with him I can include here, and this update post was largely centered around what happened with my ex-fianc\u00e9e. Why would I list boundaries I have with my friend that are unrelated to this single conflict I posted about?\n\nIn my eyes: He didn\u2019t sabotage anything. *I* chose my priorities, they were out of line with what was required for a romantic relationship, and I\u2019m now out of that relationship. The value of said relationship is relative. I hope Jess and I remain close friends, but I feel relieved to be rid of extra pressures when I wanted to live my life one way and she wanted something else.", "I think He's in love with his friend too, but he is still in the process of discovery. :D", "This more applied when we were living together, but we have boundaries surrounding alone time. Neither of us have to remind the other of these boundaries because we\u2019re different people with different interests and we both *enjoy* being alone occasionally - as everyone does. But it was something we talked about before moving in together. I don\u2019t know, this is a hard question to answer because I feel like you all think he\u2019s texting me 24/7 or tracking my whereabouts when things are actually very normal. I have never once felt the need to tell him I need to be alone other than an \u2018I\u2019m busy, I\u2019ll get back to you later\u2019 text if he reaches out and I can\u2019t reply. Which is kind of just common courtesy, it\u2019s not him blowing up my phone until I say it. \n\nI guess just apply all the expectations between spouses and apply them to our friendship? That would clear up a lot of the confusion and mental blocks people seem to have regarding prioritizing something platonic.", "This is very true. I\u2019m pretty open to anything in both regards. Romance and sexuality are not rigid for me. :)", "Like? This man is clearly gay and stringing women along. Him and Nolan have probably already slept together \u2620\ufe0f", "Right! What the hell is this crap about emotional needs met. If you\u2019ve been doing that then you\u2019ve been cheating.", "\ud83d\ude02 dead on", "A very jealous boyfriend it seems.", "Sadly, people like this have kids all the time. They just hurt their co-parents and neglect their kids.", "If there is nothing wrong with prioritizing romantic relationship partners, I see nothing wrong with prioritizing a platonic one. \n\nI\u2019m also unsure why my hypothesis unborn children keep being brought up\u2014 if I\u2019m ever going to be a father, it\u2019s years down the line. And there *are* friends who raise children together.", "I agree. It's not.", "If I were ever to get into a relationship again, my priorities would look much different. With that said, there are ways for people to have children without a partner involved.", "whether or not op is gay for nolan is another conversation, but i cant deny he does treat nolan *more than* just a brother. \n\ni have three siblings, and we all have gone through personal trauma and losses, but i cant imagine dragging my sibling away from *their family* for my shit, especially on the level Nolan has done. \n\nsomething is definitely going on and op cant or *refuses* to see it", "[deleted]", "The engagement was a spur of the moment event when I had been drinking. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s something I regret because I think both she and I knew it wasn\u2019t a \u2018marriage is right around the corner, let\u2019s start planning now\u2019 situation. I mostly just regret not having an honest conversation with her up front about the different places people took up in my life. That was a huge mistake on my end.", "He actually admitted he didn't. He said at one point that he didn't have a problem because there was nothing being damaged, even though his XGF was very upset at that point.\n\nI hope Jess finds peace. She deserves it.", "You didn\u2019t choose your priorities! She forced you to!! You lethargically strung along a woman who loved you, all while having an emotional affair with someone who has manipulated you left and right. No offense but you seem to be one of the most emotionally dense people I\u2019ve ever come across. You really need to do some serious self reflection.\n\nE: you say in your update that you took into consideration what people have said to you but you absolutely did not. Literally everyone is saying that Nolan is the problem but you have never acknowledged it at all.", "I genuinely hope she cuts you out and off like a gross oversized skin tag. Nobody needs someone in their life that has no introspection or accountability. 2 years no thoughts head empty waste of time \ud83e\udd2e", "While you are indeed the main person who sabotaged your relationship, you can't keep denying that Nolan didn't contribute at all. He did put a strain on your relationship by himself, while he chose to be cold and disrespectful in his actions to your ex. There is a good example of how your relationship with him doesn't exactly lean on the healthy side. You do not holding him accountable for anything. I think this would be a great time to talk to your therapist again and get some professional opinions since you still don't belive what the majority of people in the comments are telling you.", "Yeah she wanted to be married to you and you want to be married to Nolan.", "I hope Jess runs fast in the other direction and finds someone who is not a manipulative, selfish AH. Shame on you for what you did to her.", "God you are just such an AH", "Yes, that's been clear to everyone except you until the past few hours, it seems.", "Yes, we know.", "Exactly!!! Lol... I'm like, is he in denial?", "This is all I keep thinking. I have a friend who also has a platonic life partner situation, and I can't help of being reminded of just how jealous and manipulative the vibes said partner gives off are, because my friend VERY OFTEN has to drop everything for them. They could have written this.", "It's not about platonic vs romantic, romantic relationships can be codependent and unhealthy too. You're not prioritizing in a healthy way, you're obsessing and going to extremes in your refusal to give any leeway when it comes to this friend. \n\nYou came here to find out if you were the asshole. You are, and instead of taking steps to improve you're doubling down and burying your head in the sand. You won't listen to anyone so there's no reason to engage with you anymore.", "Do you have a therapist you can talk to about closeness vs. codependency? It\u2019s been brought up a lot that your relationship with Nolan might not be healthy for either of you. Now that Jess is out of the picture, how do you plan to make sure your relationship with Nolan is good for the both of you?", "I think because the relationship with Nolan doesn\u2019t sound healthy, that\u2019s the problem. If you can\u2019t do both it\u2019s great that you realized that so you\u2019re not stringing along the fianc\u00e9 - but the vibes are off.", "Likewise. I have two siblings who I love dearly, and friends who I would consider chosen siblings. I would happily drop everything and help any of them if they needed me. I would absolutely never stomp all over someone I purported to care about for two years to benefit them, even if they were going through crises.", "Not exactly. My best friend and soulmate is my priority. I'm saving money so they can live with me, and unless I'm gonna get fired from my job or I'm too far away, I drop everything for them. But there are NO romantic feelings whatsoever, even though we have matching orientations. There just never could be. I don't like that a lot of people have this idea that soulmates are going to be your end all be all marriage when most of the time, soulmates are in fact platonic", "I don't care if they end up together, but I don't know that I could call a relationship borne out of dishonesty and what could charitably be called an emotional affair cute.", "You're just a huge walking red flag, I only hope any other women gets involved in the middle of your unhealthy relationship with Nolan", "HELP", "Oh my god you didn\u2019t \ud83d\ude2d", "You know, i guess you could view it as he was in a committed relationship with his ex finance until recently, so it\u2019s not necessarily bad he was being tunnel visioned.  Now that he\u2019s wisely ended it, he can allow himself to think of other possibilities without guilt.  So maybe it\u2019s ultimately good.", "I do! I don\u2019t see them regularly, just on a need basis via telehealth. We have talked in the past about the weight or romantic vs platonic relationships and the role they play in our lives.", "[deleted]", "Might be worth a check-in where you talk about this more specifically. It\u2019s a big acknowledgment from you that Nolan is your platonic life partner, there\u2019s a lot to think about. Your relationship is going to change a lot as he heals from his grief, are you prepared for a time when he doesn\u2019t need you as much? Is he prepared to let go of his grief, if that\u2019s been the thing that has made you prioritize him so much? It would be terrible to get stuck in a cycle where the relationship is defined by his grief and your caretaking. I\u2019m just asking these rhetorically, btw, as examples of specific things to maybe discuss. \n\nAlso, talk to Nolan about the specifics if you haven\u2019t already! It\u2019s easy to assume you and Nolan are on the same page when you speak in generalities like \u201cYou\u2019re my family, you\u2019ll always be the most important\u201c but there is a lot of room for misunderstandings. It\u2019s non-traditional so you\u2019re building this path kinda from scratch and it\u2019s better to overcommunicate. E.g. Do you and Nolan both plan to always live near one another? Where does that rank when it comes to professional decisions? What if Nolan eventually wants to have a relationship where he actually does prioritize his fianc\u00e9 instead of you? All things you two need to talk about before they are problems. Good luck!", "Yeah, that's fair enough."]}
