The first didn't go well. I still had a lot of walls up that didn't allow me to engage properly. I didn't get angry, I just didn't say much at all. My fianc\u00e9e told me what a lot had already assumed: she didn't feel like a priority, she was hurt by my comment and my actions. She gave me specifics on what needed to change if we were to continue. I told her I needed time, and she went back to the parent's house for the night. I took this night alone to truly think over the things she had requested (no more late night visits and other harsh boundaries being put into place) and tried to imagine a life where that happened.\n\nThe second conversation was much more impactful. I took feedback I was given here - which mainly centered around honesty and apologies. I told her that I was sorry for waking her up and for not treating her how a fianc\u00e9 should. I also told her I was sorry I hadn't been prioritizing her... but that I couldn't. At least not in the top, number one spot. The gist of my side was this: my life partner, in a lot of ways, has already been chosen. It might change in the future, but as of right now, my friendship is the most important relationship in my life. He isn't just *like* family to me, he *is* family to me. That goes beyond just the two of us: his little brother is my little brother. My mom and dad have all but officially adopted them into our family and vice versa. Our lives are intrinsically enmeshed and have been since we were 15. I had been doing a disservice to her by pretending that I could put anyone else over this familial unit that has already been built. \n\nThis conversation was difficult for us both. We cried together, we attempted to compromise, but the truth of it all boiled down to 'if he needs me, or even just wants me, I'm going to do everything reasonably in my power to be there.\" We again, took the night for ourselves to process.\n\nAnd that leads us to the final conversation, which was about our future. She told me she had known the end was coming and had begun to accept it long before our conversation. I agreed. We're also planning a 'move Jess out' party between just us two where we try to have fun with it and reconnect as friends. She told me, in customary break up fashion, that she's going to cut bangs in my bathroom at some point during this planned night. \n\nSo, was I the asshole for saying that my friend's trauma was more important than her comfort? Yeah. I was. Not only because it was harsh, but because I didn't say it sooner so she could make an informed decision about whether it was a life she wanted or not. Now she gets that. I feel gracious and humbled by her forgiveness and understanding, and thankful to commenters who provided insight.\n\nETA No, I\u2019m not planning any more romantic relationships for a while.\n2 - My number one priority is Nolan, not my *entire* family.

Regardless of whether your feelings towards your friend are more than platonic though, it seems wise to examine how healthy your codependency and enmeshment with your friend is.\n\nEdit to add that this is not a general statement equating emotional intimacy between men to  queerness.

I hope you and Nolan figure out the nature of your relationship and that you both bring each other great happiness. \n\nIf you ever propose to someone again, please make sure you mean it this time.  Saying you want to get married and spend your life with someone is one of the biggest commitments you could make.  It comes with some pretty clear priorities - that your spouse will be the most important person in your life, that you won't keep secrets that affect the other, that you treat them with respect and make them, and your life together, your number one priority. \n\nTo propose to someone when you have no intention of treating them this way is, quite frankly, cruel. Please don't treat someone like that again.", "Well, I\u2019m glad Jess made it out of this one. \n\nHow do you expect to build a family like your own parents did if you\u2019re still prioritizing your friend/\u201cpractically brothers\u201d/secret-gay-lover over your SO?", "I still think is an AH move to string along your ex-fianc\u00e9e for a year and a half, but I'm glad that both you got a satisfying conclusion.", "I'm glad your fiancee was finally able to see the authentic you, and is wisely moving on.

If your friend really is family to you, then your fiance should have gotten a say as well seeing how she would've been family one day.\n\nYour relationship with your friend isn't healthy. I hope one day you realize that. The codependency is unhealthy and blocked your relationship with her and you didn't care.

You just gave up your fianc\u00e9, a life partner, for someone who will one day find their own partner.

Any person you\u2019re engaged to, married to, or even in a committed long term relationship should be your first priority after yourself.

If nolan were the be all to you and you were fulfilled you would not have been in a relationship w your fiance' for years.\n\nYour original post mentioned the death of Nolan's parent and that your entire friend group has helped him through this.  \n\nIf the entire friend group is helping why all the late night visits to you?\n\nIf all your emotional needs are being met, why become involved with your fiance' to start with and why waste years of her life?\n\nSince it is common knowledge in the friend group, what nolan has gone through, why was he so adamant to keep private &  exclude your fiance from this knowledge? I believe nolan used and continues to use his parent's death as a device to selfishly  keep you close to him, and his refusal to allow you to share the full story with your fiance (altho it is no secret since everyone in the friend group knows) is a tactic to divide you & your fiance' .\n\nWhat you are saying doesnt add up, it doesnt have to, those of us who have read and commented on your post are internet strangers.  \n\nBut you have not said you are in love with nolan or physically or romantically attracted to him.\n\nSo i  hate to see you be manipulated into losing a relationship with your fiance' (or any future partner) because of nolan's loneliness & co-dependency.", "I'm so glad she is free to find a man who respects her.

Will you be able to emotionally handle that?  The issue is, not only has Nolan become almost completely dependent on you, but it seems that you have also become completely dependent on being his emotional crutch.  I'm not sure you will be able to handle it, if a time comes where he starts to move on, gets into his own relationship, and maybe even starts a family with someone else.  Are you prepared for that possibility?", "I had you as NTA in the original post but after this update, I think I would change it.\n\nBut hey, at least you were honest with her and she can fund someone to prioritize her.", "Good for you and let this be a lesson.

As I mentioned to you before, the various kinds of attractions can and do exist separately. While I know nothing about the state of your sexual attraction, based on everything I have read, you sound like an asexual going through the sexual motions, except with romance instead. You act like how you think you should act but you don't really understand why you have to and you don't really want to. It's just not what you need.\n\nAgain, it's ok to develop a deep platonic relationship. If you're asexual and aromantic, it doesn't make you less of a man. I would look into it, especially if you choose to pursue a romantic relationship (some aroaces do) in the future. Or a sexual relationship with someone else. Establish your intentions with a relationship early on.\n\nGood luck to you.", ">I also told her I was sorry I hadn't been prioritizing her... but that I couldn't.

Your partner is also your family.\n\nIt's totally normal and fine to have boundaries with family. Partner and family can coexist as your most important things. It's fine to prioritize one family member over the other but that is all depending on circumstance and what is best in the situation. As others have said this level of codependency isn't good for either of them. Especially when one \"family\" member actively dislikes and excludes the other. \n\nEven if they aren't or never bang he might as well just consider him his boyfriend who he doesn't sleep with. No relationship will work with his view on the matter. \n\nUnless Nolan gets the help he needs and learns how to cope with his issues without requiring dumping it on OP all the time.

In his relationship with his fianc\u00e9, he admits to misrepresenting himself and the kind of relationship he could offer/partner he could be.

When my bestie needed me after a breakup with her long term boyfriend, I told my husband \"Hey, I'm spending a week with my best friend through this initial time period, and I'm going to be more available to her for the next 3 months, but I'm going to keep you in the loop of what I need and what amount of time she needs.\"\n\nI've literally never had a problem with explaining to both how I'm showing up, because neither my bestie nor my husband is unhealthily involved in wanting to commandeer all of my time.

It was more like, how do I deal with this annoying fiancee issue when the Nolan Situation is my life? \n\nThe whole thing with how his circle of secretive friends acted didn't quite make sense to me and I still feel maybe we are being lied to somehow?

Sharing could ease the burden and make any partner more understanding in the long run vs being isolated and fearing the worst.

I\u2019m also thinking more broadly, and I feel like it\u2019s important to distinguish that OP\u2019s *unhealthy* relationship with Nolan is what made him TA, and not the sheer existence of a close, emotionally intimate relationship with someone other than his romantic partner. Men too often are limited to only having their romantic partners as someone they can open up to, so I think my point is that I don\u2019t want someone to read your comment and think that emotional connection with a platonic friend = emotional infidelity. But all that said, my comment(s) should be taken as a comment on larger social relationships and not necessarily OP (although hopefully he can forge these relationships in the future!) and I realize I didn\u2019t make that clear previously. \n\nThanks for clarifying your statement, while I still don\u2019t agree that it was infidelity per se, I do agree that OP definitely failed to meet the expectations that his partner needed from him.

In many ways, but (mostly) unhealthy ways. But I dealt. I'm still dealing. Everyday is a struggle. Even in the very beginning, I never relied on anyone to the point it put them or their families out. I never asked a friend to \"not tell\" their SO or anyone else. It was a TRAUMATIC LOSS, not infidelity or something else damaging to my reputation. So why should it Need to be a secret? At first when I did need a (select few) friend's shoulder or hand, it didn't upset their household as their familial unit were all aware of the severe trauma I had incurred.

And there\u2019s no reason to leave your partner in the dark and keep things from them.. except that Nolan is treating OP\u2019s ex really poorly and not understanding that OP\u2019s partnership is something he, Nolan, should be supportive of. There\u2019s no reason at all that OP should have had to make this choice except for Nolan himself actually driving in this wedge by his crappy behavior toward Jess, and OP allowing it.", "\u201cno more late night visits and other harsh boundaries\u201d is how OP characterizes what his then-fianc\u00e9e was requiring. And, especially after how long Nolan has been dealing with his situation, it\u2019s eminently reasonable to cut out these repeating late night visits. Nolan isn\u2019t learning to cope because he\u2019s always able to get OP to drop everything to be there for him. And while yes that means OP is very loyal \u2014 to *Nolan* \u2014 I also wonder how much this is really helping Nolan, rather than just patching over his wounds in a temporary way. And how loyal Nolan really is to OP, if he won\u2019t try to draw down how disruptive he\u2019s being to OP\u2019s life.", "Well the OP strung along his fiance for 2 years pretending SHE was his family. \n\nThat's why we don't think he has good intentions.", "Yeah it literally reads like fanfiction where the male character who is canonically with a woman suddenly realizes he's ultra gay for his friend.", "It's better than an oper-ahhhh!", "It's better than an opera", "It is better than an opera!", "It\u2019s cool you feel that way, but I won\u2019t be in a relationship with someone who constantly drops me for their friends, and I would never do that to my partner. I truly don\u2019t think any relationship I have is more important than the one with my partner, that\u2019s why he\u2019s my partner in the first place. I chose him to be my top priority. That\u2019s the point.", "Engaged...... to be married", "There are many definitions and arrangements of partnership. I think a lot of people are projecting here. Without getting into if op is the AH or not. No one owns the true feeling of loyalty and love, so we shouldn't pretend that experience is unique.", "Maybe that's how they end up with women - they're so gay it goes full circle \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n(Seriously, though: this trope has been overdone. At least *some* of them gotta be fanfiction?)", "Yes. I know what engaged means. The comment said OP is/was married and mentioned he had \"legally bound himself to someone\". But he hadn't yet actually got married."]}
