My son was so excited that he accidentally dropped his dish on the floor.  And even though I cried, I told him accidents happen, and I gave him my plate. Cause I wasn't going to let him be hungry.  My husband comes home at this point and sees me crying and the mess, so he sends me rest while he cleans up and figures out what to do.

Plus, that's a huge salt intake for a pregnant woman", "NTA. She can go and buy her own damn cheese.", "NTA, but if you allow your wife to treat you as a servant because she is pregnant this may also set the precedent that she is also the more important parent.

I once needed pasta so badly I would have killed for it. Did I treat my partner like they were less than the shit on my shoe? No. I got my ass out of the house and got fucking pasta.\n\nMen with pregnant partners: your partner is going through something intense. Some pregnancies are cake, some are nightmares. Regardless, they are building you a bespoke human - be there for her. Sometimes that means a weird trip to satisfy a craving. Do it. Be there for her in the small ways that you can. But DO NOT oblige if she is being abusive towards you. Your partner is not allowed to abuse you. Period.", "NTA. I don't really think all those \"pregnant craves\" are about real pregnant body needs.

Your wife is pregnant and *not disabled*.  She can go to more shops if it is all that important.  Her criticizing you may be bc she is uncomfortable, bc pregnancy is hard work.
