If you were in your own house or apartment, whether renting or buying, you would lock up when going out of town. Your room is your secure space you pay for & have every right to have it locked in your absence.", "NTA \n\nBroke boy can buy his own food instead of shopping at your house.", "NTA You are not responsible for feeding your roommate. He is old enough, and apparently financially able, to buy his own food. Maybe he was never taught how to shop for groceries, so you might offer some hints. In no way is he entitled to enter your room at will and help himself to your food. Is it possible you are becoming an enabler? Something to think about. Good luck.", "NTA \n\nBut just cut him off entirely. Don\u2019t give in and tell him in no uncertain terms he needs to buy his own food and stop living off the rest of you.", "NTA at all. The fact that he even tried to get in your room in your absence shows he doesn't respect your boundaries and thinks he's entitled to everyone's stuff. You all should sit him down and tell him to grow up and get his own stuff once and for all. You all are not his personal bodega for snacks.", "Nta. He is a mooch. Start knocking on his door asking fotmr food", "NTA. \n\nDo be kind and giving to people less fortunate than yourself. Your roommate isn't, he's just lazy.\n\nAnd locking your door is just good practice to avoid any misunderstanding in a shared house.", "NTA\n\nInstead of joking though, just be upfront and tell him he needs to take care of his own food needs from now on. He shouldn't know your room is locked, bc he shouldn't be trying to get into your room, for any reason short of some kind of fire or other extreme emergency concern. Keep your door locked from now on.\n\nI disagree w your family - being kind and giving is different than being in-home chef. If he's willing to pay you, and you're willing to provide food service for him for that pay, then that's all you. But the kicking it once in a while w some jokes IS being kind and giving; more than that is being taken advantage of, esp if he can afford to feed himself.", "NTA he needs to grow up and buy his own food", "NTA, your new roommate needs to grow up and take responsibility for his own shopping.", "NTA. Keep locking your door and if you can put a small camera in your room, a one you can see through your phone in case someone goes into your room. Better be safe than sorry.", "NTA, this is a goddamned adult.  *He can go buy his own food.*   And the fact that he wanted to just go in your room without your permission and just TAKE it shows me he's untrustworthy.  What's stopping him from going in your room and taking your clothes, your electronics, your money?  That's not being kind and giving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
