He needs to get his own food. It's good to share if you have an agreement with your roommates to split stuff, and it's kind to share if someone else is in an emergency situation for some reason, but if he's having daily food emergencies, that's a him problem, not a you problem.", "Haaaaaaaaaaaa hahahahahahahhaa.\n\nNTA. Grown ass man mooching, pan-handling and begging in his own damn home. Get out of here with that garbage. He needs to care for his *own* needs. Learn to plan ahead. Learn to stop by the store on the way home, like the rest of us.", "NTA this guy\u2019s a fucking jerk", "NTA. I\u2019ve lived in a house with 5 people and similar completely separate food situation. I didn\u2019t have a fridge in my room but I did keep all my pantry stuff and snacks in there and I did lock my door when I left, so I feel like you\u2019re justified in doing that. \n\nThe sass and retorts in response to him asking? Eh, maybe verging on sort of mean depending on what you said but again, like others have said, he\u2019s a big boy who\u2019s asking his roommates for milk and cereal and snacks. \n\nQuestion though- did you all go over the food arrangement with him before he moved in? It might be helpful to reiterate everything again as a group", "NTA. Do not give him anymore food. Nothing, nada, zilch. Tell your roommates to not give him food either or else he will never learn. He's a mooch acting like a stray animal and not even a cute one at that.", "Nta. He is taking advantage of yall and acting entitles. I would suggest having a group meeting with everyone so you can establish some boundaries.", "NTA but please just be direct and communicate like an adult. Set a boundary, you both deserve that", "It's time to play knock knock and be broke for a week....just to see how it plays out", "Kick this free loader out what the fuck???? NTA and keep your room locked. Stop joking with him and ignore him. Have a serious discussion with your roommates about kicking him out because he is horrific. Tell him point blank \u201cyou are a grown adult and need to learn to take care of yourself. I wont be giving you anything anymore, period.\u201d\n\nMaybe look for a new place with your best friend if this gets worse, this guy is a weirdo and entitled af.", "NTA but this is a House Meeting situation. If you're annoyed,someone else might be annoyed or even quietly fuming. \n\nWhen he tried to invade your space , it became more than \"just food.\" It reeks of entitlement IMO ,and all it takes is one entitled roommate to ruin a living situation (in my experience). \n\nBe direct, keep it short, and point out facts before mentioning any feelings (most people tune out valid complaints if they think you're just gonna whine). \n\nHope it works out for you, OP.", "NTA why isn\u2019t he buying his own?\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if he runs out but this is unreasonable.", "Unlock your door. Add a lock to fridge.", "NTA. You spend so much time explaining and justifying your food system, but here's the thing: explaining is for people who didn't buy and safely store the food. Your methods are correct because they involve food that belongs to you. If some rich guy wants to eat, there are only several million food service workers happy to provide for him.", "He sounds like my ex roommate who earned $200k and still take everyone\u2019s else food and stuff and never share hers.", "LMFAO this would be absolutely hysterical", "And add a sign on the door that says \"go buy your own damn food\"", "I read that and immediately went to \"Give a man a fish...\",  and then my brain said \"Give a mouse a cookie and you feed him for a day, teach a mouse to bake and he has cookies for life\"\ud83d\ude02", "Interesting.  I've been re-exposed to those books as a parent and I now think they are really about the challenges of being a parent.

Does he have a charge card, cash, etc?", "Ugh. IF  you don't want to share your food (ad rightfully so), just so say. You don't need your own vernacular (broke boy) to get the sentiment across.", "I'm sure you realize this but FWIW, this dude is used to mommy and daddy catering to him and furnishing him with food and probably a lot else.  (Surprised he isn't asking you to do his laundry for him.)  He needs to grow up.  Sit him down and tell him he's an adult now and responsible for supplying his own food because he won't be getting any of yours.", "NTA he really should have figured out the house dynamic by now and you are doing everything you can to instruct him of the boundaries without creating drama. It isn't normal for people in that situation to share everything just because they cohabitate. And that is really creepy that he wanted access to your private space while you were gone and still did not get the message.", "NTA but stop hinting and just tell him directly that he's being a weirdo and needs to buy his own food \ud83d\udc80", "NTA: Broke boy needs to stop shopping in his room-mates rooms and go to the store. None of you owe him food.  Just flat out say, no dude, no more free food.", "NTA. Tell him he\u2019s not your dependent and he can take his own ass to the grocery store and spend his own money.", "Uhm this guy is a mooch\u2026 sorry but why do you have to give him anything? You should go to his room and ask him for snacks everyday now see how he likes it lol", "NTA, get him removed if you can", "NRA, I had a co-worker who made more money than everyone in the department. Always asking for food, I gave him two packets of oatmeal once but told him he had to replace it. Of course he never did. So next time he asked for food I told him the prices for each item. He stopped asking after that.", "NTA.  This guy is using you to save money, and needs to pay his way.  Increase the rent by what he takes, if necessary.", "NTA He's a grown ass man.", "NTA I used to live with a dude like this.\n\nHe never paid me rent it was always \"I got you next time.\" He would always steal or fuck with my shit, I ended up having to install a lock on my door.\n\nDude wouldn't even fucking buy toilet paper. He stole food from work and spent all his money on smokes, meth, and whatever tweaker project he was working on at the time.\n\nI kicked him out, changed the locks, and haven't spoken to him since.\n\nFuck that guy.", "NTA. Sounds like your family is telling you to be a doormat and make yourself usable by someone who is entirely bankrolling their lifestyle off of bumming food off of other people.\n\nKeep locking your door and don't take boundary advice from your family since they are saying they think it's okay for strangers to use you. Make fun of him, if he's okay going out of his way asking food and trying to break into your room when you're not there, he can take being spoken down to", "Broke boy that's not so broke should go buy his own food instead of  mooching off everybody else. Kindness schmindness NTA", "Or could he be one of those guys who doesn't know how to shop, either?\n\nIt sounds crazy, but if he makes more than everyone else, he might have had a great education or start in life, complete with a maid.\n\nOP, you are under no obligation, as you are all grown ups, but what do you think he would say if, the next time you grocery shopped, you asked him if he needed to shop, too?  Does he know about frozen meals or other ready-to-eat foods?\n\nAgain, you have no obligation, but offering to drive while you both shopped (he pays for his own things) might illuminate the whole situation.  Is he a deadbeat or so uneducated in how to self support that he is afraid to admit it?  \n\nOr is he truly just a totes asshole.\n\nNTA either way.", "I feel this is missing from the post. The flat out statement of \"I am not responsible for buying you food, you are. If you want something, go and buy your own. I am done sharing with you.\"", "I have read about Boris Johnson a bit.  This is he to a tee.  Apparently, he never pays.  Ever.  People just deal with it.  So weird.", "One of my kid's friends actually did not \"know\" how to buy a week's worth of groceries. Go buy snacks? Yes. Stock a fridge for well balanced meals? Nope. Had to sit down and go over \"how often do you want to shop and how many meals does that represent? How much meat is a serving, how many veg, what \"counts\" as a regular meal. No, you can't eat a single hot dog and buttered noodles every meal for a week and be healthy. Yes, that is a lot of food in the cart, but it's all carbs and no veg, minimal protein, and a lot of soda. There aren't meals in there, just ingredients.", "NTA. I would never give him ONE bite.

Me thinks he had his parents cook for him, so he literally never had to. He thinks food just appears. \n\nFolks who just refuse to learn the absolute basics of how to take care of themselves frustrates me. If they're able-bodied folks, both mentally and physically, there isn't much of an excuse."]}
