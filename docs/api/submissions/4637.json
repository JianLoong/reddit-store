One of them is my best friend but the others are just people who agreed to be roommates. I have a small fridge/freezer in my room and keep the majority of my food in my room.

There are five grown men living. If someone puts their large takeout container with half a burger inside the fridge, it takes up too much space. We all buy our own stuff too.

Quickly it became him opening the fridge and going \"where's the milk?\" or him going in the cupboard and asking where the cereal is. He knocks on our doors at times and asks for a portion of milk for his cereal. Stuff like this, I don't mind. If he wanted some chips, I didn't mind. But now his asking has increased and I cut him off. I guess I was being dickish but we are all boys and this is just how I/we talk. He'd knock on the door and I'd say \"what does broke boy want?\"(he isn't broke) But I wouldn't turn him down all the time. When I had it to spare, I'd give it to him. But he asks so often that now I do pick on him every time. I'm always heavy with banter in general but I only got on when he started asking TOO MUCH.

Over Thanksgiving I took a trip to my grandma's house and the door was locked the whole time.

Then he asked where my spare key was and I just didn't respond. When I got back he said I was an asshole for locking my room. I thought the whole situation was ridiculous so I was just joking/making fun of him. I told him to knock on the doors of the grocery store instead of mine.

He is old enough, and apparently financially able, to buy his own food. Maybe he was never taught how to shop for groceries, so you might offer some hints. In no way is he entitled to enter your room at will and help himself to your food. Is it possible you are becoming an enabler? Something to think about.

The fact that he even tried to get in your room in your absence shows he doesn't respect your boundaries and thinks he's entitled to everyone's stuff. You all should sit him down and tell him to grow up and get his own stuff once and for all. You all are not his personal bodega for snacks.", "Nta. He is a mooch.

He shouldn't know your room is locked, bc he shouldn't be trying to get into your room, for any reason short of some kind of fire or other extreme emergency concern. Keep your door locked from now on.\n\nI disagree w your family - being kind and giving is different than being in-home chef. If he's willing to pay you, and you're willing to provide food service for him for that pay, then that's all you. But the kicking it once in a while w some jokes IS being kind and giving; more than that is being taken advantage of, esp if he can afford to feed himself.", "NTA he needs to grow up and buy his own food", "NTA, your new roommate needs to grow up and take responsibility for his own shopping.", "NTA.

Or did most of the chores. Something to contribute significantly to the household. That would be cool. And fair.  \n\nHe does not.

Burns a little though.\"\n\nI wasn't there so not sure if he started blowing bubbles out his nose or what, but he left soon after and never came back asking for drugs again.\n\nMaybe it's time you start hoarding that special bottle of sour milk just for the next time the sponge comes knocking. ;)", "Definitely NTA\nhe so is.

He's saving all his grocery money by using yours.\n\nSTOP giving him anything. He tried to go in and take it while you were gone(only asked after he found it locked).  SO he's a thief on top of being cheapskate grifter.  \n\nHe is your new roommate, You owe him NOTHING.  \n\n**But stop the banter.**  Next time he asks for something say.  yes, that 1 dollar for a cup of milk(for cereal).  Yes, that's 2 bucks for the bag of chips.  Yes, that's 5 dollars for frozen dinner.   Then do not hand it over UNTIL cash is in hand.  \n\nAnd there was NO reason for any roommate to go in your room excepting an emergency(ie: candle left burning), so it is perfectly FINE to lock it(even when just going to work).\n\nI think you should have a meeting with roommates(probably without him for first meeting) and see how you all stand on the issue of New Roomie.
