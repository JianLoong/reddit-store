To get this, you need to maintain a 3.0 GPA which most students need to maintain anyway to progress in college. Are you also getting his GI benefits to pay for college?\n\nThis money is designed to help FAMILIES with college age students, be it rent, utilities, and other needs. It was designed to fill the gap in income for disabled Veterans when children \"age out\"  of dependency status and no longer are calculated in monthly compensation. Many students live at home, so hence this Bill was created.\n\nWhile *\"the VA lady\"* says it is yours, it is really more in-depth than that. You are not entitled to this because of your good grades. Just like people are not entitled to Welfare benefits. This benefit falls into the same pool of funds as welfare. You are given this, paid out of OUR taxes, to offset costs because your step-father is a disabled vet.\n\nSo, your parents are paying for your housing, utilities, food, and most likely college tuition. plus there is a $1400 VA benefit you feel you should have. $1400 does not go far living on your own. I agree you should help with costs at home. Based on market value of costs. You literally will find once you add everything up-food, electricity, a room/apartment, WIFI, gas, all the things that it might actually be a lot more than $1400. \n\nVA has some great counseling benefits and I think you should sit down with your mother to discuss this. I don't think you are TA, but I do think you need to check your entitlement and privilege. Just like step-dad got you the education benefit, they can easily take you off of it or refuse the renew it each year based on how poorly you treat them. You CAN'T get that unless step-dad submits all required documentation to renew it.", "Question- who\u2019s paying tuition for school?\nBIG difference in GI bill (chapter 33) and 100% (chapter 35) benefits. When you talk about gpa it makes me think chapter 33 as the other has no gpa stipulations. The BIG difference- chapter 35 only has the stipend, NO TUITION IS PAID. If it is GI BILL being used, there is also a $1000 per year \u201cbook stipend\u201d. It makes a big difference what benefits are being used. The \u201cVA lady\u201d is correctin that monies are yours. It\u2019s meant to pay living expenses (I think GI bill can cover dorms- don\u2019t remember) so there is that.", "NTA - They are paying that money to you.  Your mother and stepdad get their own VA benefits", "This entire situation is suspect. And has so many holes in the story. \n\nIf you\u2019re 19 & getting benefits, why can\u2019t you open your own bank account & have the funds deposited in it?\n\nAnd then you pay your mom rent/room & board/groceries/etc for what is deserved with you living at home. \n\nHow are you getting benefits from your stepdad? How did it get determined that you would? Who did the work so you would? How do they know what your gpa is to keep getting these benefits?\n\nAll of those questions need to be answered to make judgement.  If you\u2019re getting the benefits because your mom put forth the effort & got your stepdad to agree to them then you should definitely be paying to live In their house since you\u2019re an adult. Keep this in mind, before she throws it in your face. Being offensively defensive is a must with narcissists. \n\nCompleting any paperwork for the government is a headache & requires a lot of work. I\u2019m not saying your mom deserves all of your money (that she\u2019s apparently taking) but you should make sure you\u2019re paying your rent there when the money is going directly to you and she has no access to it.

Step-dad and most likely mom went through the VA process to get her this benefit. Government paperwork is a nightmare.

I.e. free ride.   \n\n\nThis benefit is renewed annually or if asked, step-dad/mom need to jump the hoops and literally submit her grades with a renewal application to the VA/GI Bill site to continue the benefit.

The VA has my file on record which is shared with the school, when my GPA drops it sends an alert to the VA\u2019s system where they can stop supplying funds. I already made a bank account and have the money going there. I\u2019m not paid right now since I\u2019m not in school but will start getting paid again in August. I have offered to pay rent, some bills, groceries, etc. but she refuses and wants me to give her the VA money.

It is not easy to separate out...like $33.98 went towards the power bill, $580 went to rent, $23 went to that pizza dinner. Co-mingled funds are commingled. They get spent to float a household. I am not sure she is lying, I am guessing she doesn't know because it is all in the same \"money pot\". It is frustrating for you, but there is a gray area in there.   \n\n\nIn this economy, I am sure it is hard to stay afloat on VA benefits. Is mom working as well? Are there other kids? It is not much money, so I am guessing they are scrapping to get by. It sucks that you thought she was saving it and she has not been.

My eldest brother has been no contact with her for the last two years and refuses to talk to her because of her behavior. This is a common thing she does. The benefit I have is Chapter 35. I get the money because my stepdad is 100% disabled in the VA\u2019s eyes. The VA themselves have told me that he is not capable of stopping the money if that makes sense. The only way to do so is if he lowers his disability to 90%. I\u2019ve offered to pay rent, to pay for groceries, etc. but she refuses. I dont know what else to say other than she wants me to depend on her. She did it with my brothers, and now to me. I wouldnt mind paying her for rent, but the reason the money comes in the first place is because of my work in college. I dont do a good job, I dont get paid. My problem lies mostly in the fact that she is lying about what she\u2019s doing with the money.

I will say, having these benefits gives you a huge boost in life...be grateful for it.   \n\n\nPush has come to shove. If you can move in with your brother this summer, that is what I would recommend. Once there, work with your VA lady to get the funds deposited into your account and not moms. Work full-time this summer to save money. Just get out, if you can't talk with her, then go to your brothers. Offer to assist him with rent and food.

Also the recertification process is *incredibly easy* every semester. Getting started initially is what\u2019s more difficult. And the only reason my process was hard is because my dad put my social in incorrectly lol. I would\u2019ve done it myself but was in another state and they insisted on helping.", "Thank you!

While it is earned due to his disability, this specific scholarship, unlike the GI bill, is *not* able to be used by the vet themselves. This bill is specifically made for dependents and spouses. Not going to say OP is an AH or not because I don\u2019t know, but I have this bill personally and use it to pay off loans and pay all my bills by myself. My parents (one who is the disabled vet) were proud of me when I found it because the VA hadn\u2019t told us about it and we had only known about the GI. This bill is specifically for survivors and dependents though. It\u2019s made for 100% disabled, MIA, things of that nature. Again, I don\u2019t read the full post, just providing more context. Can\u2019t offer a judgment since I haven\u2019t fully read. I also don\u2019t think we can be taken off of these benefits, unlike with the GI bill that can be altered and transferred. I do the renewal by myself every year, and I have a good relationship with my parents but it works  differently and each member that is a spouse or dependent gets their own 35 months. It\u2019s very different from GI. You can\u2019t use Chapter 35 and 33 (GI) at the same time. \n\nAlso our health insurance isn\u2019t free? Unless you mean we aren\u2019t paying for it. I still pay meds and copays like everyone else. I still pay car insurance like everyone else. Also, my dad, who\u2019s actually in the military, said we don\u2019t lose our insurance unless we stop attending some form of educational institution. It\u2019s not as simple as them \u201cchoosing not to cover you\u201d when it comes to the military. It\u2019s far more complicated. We had this discussing when we were worried about my partner losing his due to the way one of his parents was behaving, and that\u2019s when it was brought up that it\u2019s not as simple as to just remove them. It is for the GI bill but anything like insurance is not simple.", "The medical benefits weren\u2019t the only thing that my husband didn\u2019t know about.

The VA is a broken system and makes no sense.", "Ahhh...yes, the VA system. It is all about adding up percentages and knowing how to ask. Some people truly are disabled. Do not get me wrong. Some get 10% because they had Acne scars at 18 while enrolled, 20% for ear ringing, enrolled and got a broken nose from wrecking your motorcycle on time off trying to show off-15%, etc. It all adds up.

She's just committing fraud to steal money from both the child and VA.\n\nAlso, you can't get chapter 35 benefits, which is what the OP is talking about, and GI Bill benefits at the same time. They are separate things entirely. You also apply for it yourself, he does not apply for it after getting his disability rating. The step-father also already has a generous stipend based on his disability rating.\n\nIt really, actually is for you to solely use for school expenses and your living expenses for college. It's technically illegal to do otherwise. Unless the mother has formal rent and fee declaration, it is illegal for her to be taking the money for herself. She's not even the disabled veteran here.\n\nThe GI Bill is meant for the servicemember and can be granted to a dependent alternatively, but Chapter 35 benefits are solely for the dependent and to be used by them.\n\nI've see a lot of fraud like this where the service member attempts to shake down a dependent for some or even all of the benefit money that they are supposed to be receiving, since \"it's their benefits anyways\".\n\nBut no, that's not how it works. The benefit is that for the sacrifice that a service member went through, their children and spouse get financial support for college. It's the same as me being a full grown adult and being independent of my military parents, but I still get access to Navy Federal and USAA, when most people don't. This benefits solely me because my parents were in the military.\n\nOP is entirely entitled to the money unless the step dad writes her off.
