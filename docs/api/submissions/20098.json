To get this, you need to maintain a 3.0 GPA which most students need to maintain anyway to progress in college. Are you also getting his GI benefits to pay for college?\n\nThis money is designed to help FAMILIES with college age students, be it rent, utilities, and other needs. It was designed to fill the gap in income for disabled Veterans when children \"age out\"  of dependency status and no longer are calculated in monthly compensation. Many students live at home, so hence this Bill was created.\n\nWhile *\"the VA lady\"* says it is yours, it is really more in-depth than that. You are not entitled to this because of your good grades. Just like people are not entitled to Welfare benefits. This benefit falls into the same pool of funds as welfare. You are given this, paid out of OUR taxes, to offset costs because your step-father is a disabled vet.\n\nSo, your parents are paying for your housing, utilities, food, and most likely college tuition. plus there is a $1400 VA benefit you feel you should have. $1400 does not go far living on your own. I agree you should help with costs at home. Based on market value of costs. You literally will find once you add everything up-food, electricity, a room/apartment, WIFI, gas, all the things that it might actually be a lot more than $1400. \n\nVA has some great counseling benefits and I think you should sit down with your mother to discuss this. I don't think you are TA, but I do think you need to check your entitlement and privilege. Just like step-dad got you the education benefit, they can easily take you off of it or refuse the renew it each year based on how poorly you treat them. You CAN'T get that unless step-dad submits all required documentation to renew it.", "Question- who\u2019s paying tuition for school?\nBIG difference in GI bill (chapter 33) and 100% (chapter 35) benefits. When you talk about gpa it makes me think chapter 33 as the other has no gpa stipulations. The BIG difference- chapter 35 only has the stipend, NO TUITION IS PAID. If it is GI BILL being used, there is also a $1000 per year \u201cbook stipend\u201d. It makes a big difference what benefits are being used. The \u201cVA lady\u201d is correctin that monies are yours. It\u2019s meant to pay living expenses (I think GI bill can cover dorms- don\u2019t remember) so there is that.", "NTA - They are paying that money to you.  Your mother and stepdad get their own VA benefits", "This entire situation is suspect. And has so many holes in the story. \n\nIf you\u2019re 19 & getting benefits, why can\u2019t you open your own bank account & have the funds deposited in it?\n\nAnd then you pay your mom rent/room & board/groceries/etc for what is deserved with you living at home. \n\nHow are you getting benefits from your stepdad? How did it get determined that you would? Who did the work so you would? How do they know what your gpa is to keep getting these benefits?\n\nAll of those questions need to be answered to make judgement.  If you\u2019re getting the benefits because your mom put forth the effort & got your stepdad to agree to them then you should definitely be paying to live In their house since you\u2019re an adult. Keep this in mind, before she throws it in your face. Being offensively defensive is a must with narcissists. \n\nCompleting any paperwork for the government is a headache & requires a lot of work. I\u2019m not saying your mom deserves all of your money (that she\u2019s apparently taking) but you should make sure you\u2019re paying your rent there when the money is going directly to you and she has no access to it. Again, be offensively defensive. \n\nOnce you get your own account and have the money going into the account. Give your mom, the dollar amount you feel is fair to stay there. If she disagrees then tell her you\u2019re going to move out and do it. \n\nIf she agrees to the dollar amount, make sure you\u2019re still saving so you can move out & give her notice when you\u2019re getting close to the dollar amount & found somewhere to go.", "How do you get your step parent\u2019s disability if you\u2019re not blood related or adopted?", "NTA and your mother is financially abusing you - what she's done is criminal.", "Thank you for explaining it here as mo:5 people don\u2019t understand that it is HIS benefit and not hers.

Step-dad and most likely mom went through the VA process to get her this benefit. Government paperwork is a nightmare. I am guessing Step-dads GI Bill/benefits-that can be passed on to children/step-children are also covering her tuition. I.e. free ride.   \n\n\nThis benefit is renewed annually or if asked, step-dad/mom need to jump the hoops and literally submit her grades with a renewal application to the VA/GI Bill site to continue the benefit. Without them, them is no $1400;", "It was hard to explain all of it in depth with the character limit. How the VA explained it to me is that I\u2019m his dependent. The VA has my file on record which is shared with the school, when my GPA drops it sends an alert to the VA\u2019s system where they can stop supplying funds. I already made a bank account and have the money going there. I\u2019m not paid right now since I\u2019m not in school but will start getting paid again in August. I have offered to pay rent, some bills, groceries, etc. but she refuses and wants me to give her the VA money. My problem isn\u2019t with the fact that she\u2019s taking it, it\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s lying to me about what she\u2019s doing with it. She told me first hand it was for when I need it later on in life. But she has repeatedly proclaimed she\u2019s used it for her own benefit.", "IF she was a dependent child before age 18 under his roof AND they claimed her for VA disability compensation AND the step-father acknowledges her as a GI benefit recipient then she can get this. So really, the step-father is giving her a benefit she is not entitled to on her own. They can also take it away or not renew it.   \n\n\nI wonder if HIS GI Benefits are paying for her college tuition as well.", "It is not \"her\" money. It is a benefit her step-father applies for to assist offset costs.", "No. He has to agree to allow her to use his GI Bill benefits. She is not entitled to anything without his willingness to do the paperwork and state she is his college age dependent.   \n\n\nIf her father was a Veteran killed in action, that would be different. But, in this case step-dad needs to complete paperwork under HIS benefit so she can get this.", "She says she is living at home. Then offered to pay some money for rent out of it if she got the money deposited to her. She needs to work this out with mom via a counselor.", "The only reason she is \"entitled\" to it is because her step-father, married to her mother, applies for it under HIS GI Benefits. It is not hers. Without her mothers marriage and stepfather's willingness to jump through fiery hoops, she would not get this benefit.", "I agree. I also understand being that age, mother/child relationships, and feeling things are toxic as well. Just want to make sure we are giving good advice.   \n\n\nI didn't even include toiletries, toilet paper, all those things in monthly costs. LOL.", "It is HIS benefit. He is passing it on to her to use. I would hate to burn that bridge by fighting with them. I am also guessing step-dad is using HIS benefit to cover her college tuition as well. And she gets free health insurance.   \n\n\nFor those of us in the USA-think of it like Health Insurance. If your parents have an insurance policy through work and you are a college student, they can choose to cover you under their policy until you are 26. They can also choose to not cover you. You can't call Blue Cross or United Health Care to demand that you are entitled to be on their policy. It is their choice. They have to place you on it and they can also remove you from it.", "No. It is not fraud.  It is not for college tuition alone. It is a money for offsetting costs. Costs can include rent, food, books, etc. Technically if mom is using it for household expenses that is what it is for. I know OP is saying she is misusing it, but again, that would be super hard to prove legally. But, there is nothing to prove really.", "It doesn't sound like it's for tuition, it sounds like it's for OP to spend.", "A student is not able to use more than one benefit at a time.", "Most of this is false. The mom didn't have to do anything for the benefits. The dad was considered 100% disabled. The kid applied for the benefits and was approved for X amount of months, usually 36 months. There is no renewal. The school takes care of reporting the grades, if necessary.", "Hi OP! Mother and daughter relationships are rough. It would be great to know what exactly she is spending it on. But, I will be honest, if it is going into a bank account for the household, it would be hard to tell. It is not easy to separate out...like $33.98 went towards the power bill, $580 went to rent, $23 went to that pizza dinner. Co-mingled funds are commingled. They get spent to float a household. I am not sure she is lying, I am guessing she doesn't know because it is all in the same \"money pot\". It is frustrating for you, but there is a gray area in there.   \n\n\nIn this economy, I am sure it is hard to stay afloat on VA benefits. Is mom working as well? Are there other kids? It is not much money, so I am guessing they are scrapping to get by. It sucks that you thought she was saving it and she has not been. When she \"proclaims\" she is using it for her own benefit, what does that mean? To pay the power bill? Buy food? Pay care insurance?", "She may be an alcoholic or drug user or have a gambling habit.  Be careful and keep the money.", "It was hard to explain in depth of the situation with the character limit. But my mother is not a kind woman. She is manipulative, and has made it hard for me and my brothers to get out on our own. My eldest brother has been no contact with her for the last two years and refuses to talk to her because of her behavior. This is a common thing she does. The benefit I have is Chapter 35. I get the money because my stepdad is 100% disabled in the VA\u2019s eyes. The VA themselves have told me that he is not capable of stopping the money if that makes sense. The only way to do so is if he lowers his disability to 90%. I\u2019ve offered to pay rent, to pay for groceries, etc. but she refuses. I dont know what else to say other than she wants me to depend on her. She did it with my brothers, and now to me. I wouldnt mind paying her for rent, but the reason the money comes in the first place is because of my work in college. I dont do a good job, I dont get paid. My problem lies mostly in the fact that she is lying about what she\u2019s doing with the money. She isnt saving it for me for when I move on to different things, she\u2019s using it for her own benefit.", "OP is female and period supplies are the reason I had a hormonal IUD put in.", "Hello! I totally get where the grey area is, hence why I\u2019m here to get an opinion. She works as well, my step dad also works and he also gets his own VA benefit on top of it. I\u2019ve asked her to show me where she is keeping my money safe but wont show me. Her reasonings jump from \u201cit\u2019s your money im keeping safe\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s my money that i\u2019ve earned\u201d depending on the situation. From conversations that I have overheard, she\u2019s used the money to pay for bills, dog food (we have 8 dogs, all of which she wanted and got spontaneously), to get her hair done, and for shopping for her own stuff. I have a step sister that lives with us so there is 4 of us in total. She brags all the time how she \u201cmakes more than enough money.\u201d I will use my own money from my paycheck from my job to contribute to groceries.", "I feel for you. Mom is using the money for day to day things, not in your best interest, but more to support the household. As each child moves out, the VA monthly benefits shrink, so this is a huge deal for her. Sounds like mom is also super manipulative and toxic. \n\nWhat I would recommend is getting a VA counselor and asking mom to go to some counseling with you. The goal is to not \"win\" or be \"right\" but to smooth somethings over until you can get on your feet. Can older brother help house you?   \n\n\nChapter 35 is contingent on step-dad. Yes, you get it, but technically, they could stop it or much with it if they are that vindictive. Be careful.", "OP, I understand more than you know. Cut your loses on the money. It is gone. Don't do \"hand-to-hand combat\" with mom on the issue. You will get nowhere. Yes, mom wants you around for the extra money that comes in. It sucks. Instead of fighting with mom over the money (which she wants), take that energy and makes steps to leave the situation. Literally, the less mom knows it bothers you the better. Shift from defensive to offensive.", "How is your step dad working if he's 100% disabled?", "Run!", "I really just need the money to get out on my own. My older brother has said countless of times that he would be willing to house me if push comes to shove. He (who is in the marine corp) along with my biological dad (he is a retired marine veteran as well but does not have 100% disability even though he is way worse off than my stepdad which I find odd. I dont know how the VA decides stuff in that aspect but oh well) both said to not let her have the money. They both agreed it\u2019s for me, and the VA office and VA people at my college said the Chapter 35 is for me alone as well. I wouldn\u2019t mind contributing, but her lies and manipulative behavior make me want to keep it to get out ASAP. I dont want to depend on her but shes making it impossible", "The VA disability system is and can be a hustle. People can get 100% disability if they know how to play the game. They don't even need to have war related injuries. Sometimes the \"service\" disabilities are questionable as well. Sometimes those who really need it, don't get it. \n\nYes, the Chapter 35 benefit is FOR you, but it is contingent upon step-dad. Long story. I will say, having these benefits gives you a huge boost in life...be grateful for it.   \n\n\nPush has come to shove. If you can move in with your brother this summer, that is what I would recommend. Once there, work with your VA lady to get the funds deposited into your account and not moms. Work full-time this summer to save money. Just get out, if you can't talk with her, then go to your brothers. Offer to assist him with rent and food. Part of the adulthood step is covering your own expenses to the best of your ability.   \n\n\nAnd go see a counselor. Trust me. There is nothing wrong with this. Growing up in toxic households can have a huge impact."]}
