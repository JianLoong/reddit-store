There are three of us in total - I'm the oldest (27m), the newlywed is the middle child, and our little brother is 21. \r  \n\r  \nAt one point, I hated Middle Brother's partner. The two of them had bonded over some rough times they had both experienced and were self-medicating together. My brother wasn't using hard drugs himself, and I don't think his partner was ever properly addicted to anything, but I had gotten word that I needed to look out for him. I made it known I didn't approve of the relationship and thought he was a bad influence. My brother and I didn't speak without arguing for probably a good two years. \r  \n\r  \nThat's all changed now. His partner has been sober for many years and has become a close friend of mine and our little brother. We both gave toast speeches and in Little Brother's, he said \"I can say there's four \\[our last name\\] brothers now instead of just three.\" It was a very touching sentiment.\r  \n\r  \nAfter all the speeches are given, my wife pulls me aside kind of angrily and asks what I thought about them. I said they were lovely. It turns out she was mad over the fact that when Little Brother gave a speech and mine and her wedding, he didn't insinuate she was the first daughter of the family or anything like that. She said that his speech had mostly been focused on me, whereas his speech tonight was focused equally on both spouses and the future of their lives together.\r  \n\r  \nI brushed this off and said she needed to stop reading into things so much. About 20 minutes later, I see her looking similarly angry during a conversation with Little Brother. I walked over to try and put a stop to this myself, but I saw our other brother and his new husband coming over so he must've caught wind of what was happening as well. The two of us are very protective over our youngest sibling, so Middle Brother comes out of the gate swinging asking why she's pestering him.\r  \n\r  \nIt all devolved pretty quickly. I wouldn't say a scene was caused as everyone was trying to keep it hush-hush, but my wife ended up crying when she was asked to leave and that attracted some attention. She asked me to come back to the hotel room with her, and I refused. I wanted to continue celebrating. She was very angry and said this was just another way I was letting my brothers walk over her, and that I was excusing them not giving her a chance.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, she and I haven't really spoken. I need some outside perspective. It's true that my brothers aren't nearly as close to her as we are to the new addition to our family, but that's just how these things go sometimes.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685661084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xwfj5/aita_for_not_leaving_my_brothers_wedding_with_my/", "score": 4283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't blame her for feeling hurt about it, but she shouldn't have brought it up at the wedding, as this wedding wasn't about her.  \n\nI've said it before, but resentment is the biggest killer of relationships - your wife has put something in her room of resentment, and it isn't going to go away by itself - you need to address it or it will just continue festering in the back of her mind along with anything else she puts in there.  Reasonable or not, you should have taken her side - not in an argument, but by calmly removing her from the situation.  Even escorting her back to the hotel to calm down.

For her to decide to make it an issue at someone else's wedding is appalling.\n\nUnless there is a legitimate underlying issue (e.g. your brother's speech at your wedding was insulting, she is actively excluded from family events, you and/or your brothers are misogynistic) that you have failed to mention, NTA.", "She caused a scene at a wedding which is never ok.\n\nHowever she is right you are letting your brothers walk all over her.

That was what the excluders told them if they wondered why I wasn\u2019t there.", "And your partner were?", "Stolen comment. u/l3ex_G posted this a few hours ago.", "If my wife were as self-absorbed as OPs wife, I would have never married her. So, there's that.", "Yes he did - she was angry that the youngest brother didn't take the time in his speech to mention her becoming family via marriage, the way that he mentioned the GROOM becoming family. Which probably only happened because the new spouse is a man so he said \"4th brother\" instead of \"5th sibling\" or whatever the hell she wanted him to say.", "It wasn't just a party though. It was his brother's wedding. A brother he had a pretty difficult relationship with which just recently healed. I've had rather difficult relationships with my siblings and it's hard sometimes coming out the other end. I can tell you I would absolutely pick my sibling's wedding over my spouse being petty and salty. A grown adult being salty does not get to spoil the wedding for the whole family.\n\nEta: I'm not saying this applies here or that OP's relationship is in any way abusive or toxic but I just wanted to point out that throwing a tantrum during a family event in order to isolate their spouse *is* a tactic that some abusers use. Again, not saying it applies here but just wanted to say that. Someone shouldn't feel obligated to leave with their spouse just because their spouse makes a scene or throws a tantrum at an event without applying context (is it a pattern? Are there there other abusive behaviors for eg.). Some abusers will start conflict exactly with the aim of cutting the event short for their partner and forcing them to leave.", "Still says \u201eit devolved pretty quickly\u201c, and there wasn\u2019t a scene. I agree it\u2019s hard to judge, but coupled with OP\u2018s comments concerning his brothers\u2018 treatment of his wife, I\u2019m inclined to believe they overreacted in kicking her out.", "You wrote \"wasn't just that she made a scene\" - which means: the scene + something else\nAnd I am not contesting that the something else was rude of her. But she didn't make a scene.", "It's not even gender roles, it's respecting your partner and supporting their place in the family. I'm not a guy, but someone comes for my partner through me first, and there will be innards on the floor if they want to go hard. This includes my partner's family, too. They can have their longstanding relational weirdness, but if I have to get involved, no one will be unheard/unscarred. \n\nI prefer family gatherings to happen peacefully; let's fight around the spades table.", "Agree. Wife experienced the consequences of her actions. No part of the day was about her. I get that she felt slighted and some sort of way, but the mature response would have been to talk with her husband after the event. I don\u2019t fault him for not leaving with her. \n\nI\u2019ve been where she is, ignored by in-laws. At some point she\u2019s going to have to accept that the brothers don\u2019t feel close to her and just make peace with it and be cordial or stop going to family events. As Bonnie Raitt said, \u201cI can\u2019t make you love me if you don\u2019t; you can\u2019t make your heart feel something it won\u2019t\u2026\u201d Life is still good even when some people don\u2019t love you back.", "But a grown woman needs it?", "She did. It was a scene as soon as someone else heard her. But I don\u2019t see what you\u2019re arguing here. Even if there was no scene, she\u2019d still be an asshole. Because the scene wasn\u2019t the root of the problem, only a symptom.", "> At some point she\u2019s going to have to accept that the brothers don\u2019t feel close to her and just make peace with it and be cordial or stop going to family events.\n\nOr, possibly, put in the work to get close to them. It sounds to me like she expects closeness purely based on being married to OP.", "You're right she should divorce OP and free herself from this family.\n\nAs to why she engaged it's simply because this was the straw the broke the camel's back and simply blew up wanting an answer as to where she really stands in the family."]}
