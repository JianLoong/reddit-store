There are three of us in total - I'm the oldest (27m), the newlywed is the middle child, and our little brother is 21. \r  \n\r  \nAt one point, I hated Middle Brother's partner. The two of them had bonded over some rough times they had both experienced and were self-medicating together. My brother wasn't using hard drugs himself, and I don't think his partner was ever properly addicted to anything, but I had gotten word that I needed to look out for him. I made it known I didn't approve of the relationship and thought he was a bad influence. My brother and I didn't speak without arguing for probably a good two years. \r  \n\r  \nThat's all changed now. His partner has been sober for many years and has become a close friend of mine and our little brother. We both gave toast speeches and in Little Brother's, he said \"I can say there's four \\[our last name\\] brothers now instead of just three.\" It was a very touching sentiment.\r  \n\r  \nAfter all the speeches are given, my wife pulls me aside kind of angrily and asks what I thought about them. I said they were lovely. It turns out she was mad over the fact that when Little Brother gave a speech and mine and her wedding, he didn't insinuate she was the first daughter of the family or anything like that. She said that his speech had mostly been focused on me, whereas his speech tonight was focused equally on both spouses and the future of their lives together.\r  \n\r  \nI brushed this off and said she needed to stop reading into things so much. About 20 minutes later, I see her looking similarly angry during a conversation with Little Brother. I walked over to try and put a stop to this myself, but I saw our other brother and his new husband coming over so he must've caught wind of what was happening as well. The two of us are very protective over our youngest sibling, so Middle Brother comes out of the gate swinging asking why she's pestering him.\r  \n\r  \nIt all devolved pretty quickly. I wouldn't say a scene was caused as everyone was trying to keep it hush-hush, but my wife ended up crying when she was asked to leave and that attracted some attention. She asked me to come back to the hotel room with her, and I refused. I wanted to continue celebrating. She was very angry and said this was just another way I was letting my brothers walk over her, and that I was excusing them not giving her a chance.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, she and I haven't really spoken. I need some outside perspective. It's true that my brothers aren't nearly as close to her as we are to the new addition to our family, but that's just how these things go sometimes.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685661084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xwfj5/aita_for_not_leaving_my_brothers_wedding_with_my/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't blame her for feeling hurt about it, but she shouldn't have brought it up at the wedding, as this wedding wasn't about her.  \n\nI've said it before, but resentment is the biggest killer of relationships - your wife has put something in her room of resentment, and it isn't going to go away by itself - you need to address it or it will just continue festering in the back of her mind along with anything else she puts in there.  Reasonable or not, you should have taken her side - not in an argument, but by calmly removing her from the situation.  Even escorting her back to the hotel to calm down.

For her to decide to make it an issue at someone else's wedding is appalling.\n\nUnless there is a legitimate underlying issue (e.g. your brother's speech at your wedding was insulting, she is actively excluded from family events, you and/or your brothers are misogynistic) that you have failed to mention, NTA.", "She caused a scene at a wedding which is never ok.\n\nHowever she is right you are letting your brothers walk all over her.
