{"id": 18744, "submission_id": "13xwfj5", "title": "AITA for not leaving my brother's wedding with my crying wife when she was kicked out?", "selftext": "My brother (26m) got married last Saturday. There are three of us in total - I'm the oldest (27m), the newlywed is the middle child, and our little brother is 21. \r  \n\r  \nAt one point, I hated Middle Brother's partner. The two of them had bonded over some rough times they had both experienced and were self-medicating together. My brother wasn't using hard drugs himself, and I don't think his partner was ever properly addicted to anything, but I had gotten word that I needed to look out for him. I made it known I didn't approve of the relationship and thought he was a bad influence. My brother and I didn't speak without arguing for probably a good two years. \r  \n\r  \nThat's all changed now. His partner has been sober for many years and has become a close friend of mine and our little brother. We both gave toast speeches and in Little Brother's, he said \"I can say there's four \\[our last name\\] brothers now instead of just three.\" It was a very touching sentiment.\r  \n\r  \nAfter all the speeches are given, my wife pulls me aside kind of angrily and asks what I thought about them. I said they were lovely. It turns out she was mad over the fact that when Little Brother gave a speech and mine and her wedding, he didn't insinuate she was the first daughter of the family or anything like that. She said that his speech had mostly been focused on me, whereas his speech tonight was focused equally on both spouses and the future of their lives together.\r  \n\r  \nI brushed this off and said she needed to stop reading into things so much. About 20 minutes later, I see her looking similarly angry during a conversation with Little Brother. I walked over to try and put a stop to this myself, but I saw our other brother and his new husband coming over so he must've caught wind of what was happening as well. The two of us are very protective over our youngest sibling, so Middle Brother comes out of the gate swinging asking why she's pestering him.\r  \n\r  \nIt all devolved pretty quickly. I wouldn't say a scene was caused as everyone was trying to keep it hush-hush, but my wife ended up crying when she was asked to leave and that attracted some attention. She asked me to come back to the hotel room with her, and I refused. I wanted to continue celebrating. She was very angry and said this was just another way I was letting my brothers walk over her, and that I was excusing them not giving her a chance.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, she and I haven't really spoken. I need some outside perspective. It's true that my brothers aren't nearly as close to her as we are to the new addition to our family, but that's just how these things go sometimes.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685661084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xwfj5/aita_for_not_leaving_my_brothers_wedding_with_my/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like with all this 'looking out for' your brothers, your wife has been left on the sidelines.  People do get a bit emotional at weddings and this obviously hit a nerve for her.\n\nThere have been some bad times with this 'new addition' that don't sound great - I assume she was supportive of you - yet now he is totally embraced and she still isn't?  I don't blame her for feeling hurt about it, but she shouldn't have brought it up at the wedding, as this wedding wasn't about her.  \n\nI've said it before, but resentment is the biggest killer of relationships - your wife has put something in her room of resentment, and it isn't going to go away by itself - you need to address it or it will just continue festering in the back of her mind along with anything else she puts in there.  Reasonable or not, you should have taken her side - not in an argument, but by calmly removing her from the situation.  Even escorting her back to the hotel to calm down.  But it sounds like you ganged up on her with Team Bro.  Your wife should be closer to you than the 'new addition' to the family.", "Esh, but it seems like you and your brothers all being closer to the \"new addition\" than anyone is with your wife (including you apparently) seems to be a serious problem both in your marriage and in your family. Also she shouldn't have talked to your brother with tensions high, but getting kicked out and you and middle brother swooping in to \"protect\" little brother from a conversation with your wife is extreme. Why didn't you leave with your wife? It sounds like you don't value her.", "Yikes. There\u2019s more to this story than what\u2019s being presented here. I don\u2019t think making a scene at the wedding was necessary, but why does your wife feel excluded from the family? And why are you tolerating it? I hope the idea of being single appeals to you. Your wife shouldn\u2019t put up with a lifetime of this.", "> She was very angry and said this was just another way I was letting my brothers walk over her..\n\nSounds like you need to sit down and chat with your wife about why she feels this way. She was definitely T A H for her behavior at the wedding, but I question what has happened in the years you two have been together for her to crack like that.\n\nNTA but you have your work cut out for you to navigate this situation if you want a happy wife and happy siblings.", "INFO:\n\n1.\tWhy are you and Middle Brother so protective of Little Brother?\n2.\tWhy aren\u2019t your brothers as close to your wife as they are to Middle Brother\u2019s husband besides it being \u201cjust how these things go sometimes.\u201d Is she persnickety?

There\u2019s something specific here you\u2019re not going into. What is that?\n4.\tWhy did you pregame at a dry wedding? How much time passed before pregaming and the wedding? More importantly, how much time passed before pregaming and the *reception*? I\u2019m assuming this wasn\u2019t the hour-plus-long Catholic wedding mass, so I\u2019m betting the ceremony clocked in around 20 minutes or so?\n5.\tHow much food had your wife had to eat throughout the day leading up to the reception?\n6.\tHow long have you and your wife been together?

Your brother is older than he was at your wedding, he's more experienced at giving speeches (since he already had the experience of doing it at your wedding), he has a different relationship with his middle brother as compared to his oldest brother, he has probably learned things from observing you as a married man that has informed his opinion of what marriage means which then informed the kind of speech he wanted to give...all of which makes it likely that he would have made different speeches at the two weddings regardless of how he felt about his new in-law.\n\nFor your wife to assume that the difference was somehow a slight against her shows a large degree of self-centeredness. For her to decide to make it an issue at someone else's wedding is appalling.\n\nUnless there is a legitimate underlying issue (e.g. your brother's speech at your wedding was insulting, she is actively excluded from family events, you and/or your brothers are misogynistic) that you have failed to mention, NTA.", "She caused a scene at a wedding which is never ok.\n\nHowever she is right you are letting your brothers walk all over her. You baby brother is a grown ass man. He doesn\u2019t need you to protect him from your wife.\n\nYou prioriEd your sibling over your wife. I have a feeling this isn\u2019t the first time. So at your next wedding, because I am sure she is not going to take the backseat to your family much longer, the brothers may want to make the so each less about singing your praises and a little more about welcoming the new member to the family.", "ESH\n\nYour wife shouldn't have mentioned anything at the wedding, while she was angry. Or not made that speech comparison, at all.\n\nYou should've played a bigger role in descalating the situation, quicker. Kicking her out was kind of a crazy punishment for a convo with little brother. And you not being bothered enough to stop celebrating is telling. You need to ask yourself why your mood wasn't effected, at all. I would look at you differently from her perspective.", "YTA for so many reasons in this post but also because there is clearly a backstory that you aren\u2019t sharing", "INFO\n\nWhy does it seem like your brothers don\u2019t like your wife?

But it's important to remember that your wedding day is a special occasion, and your wife's feelings should be a priority.   \n\n\nIt seems like you didn't handle the situation well by dismissing her concerns and refusing to support her when she was upset. It's important to communicate and empathize with each other in a relationship.

Your wife went and attacked your younger brother for the speech he made at your mutual brother's wedding?? this is insane. You don't get to center yourself in a wedding speech or tell other people how to feel about you, that shit is earned, not demanded as it was by your wife - who isn't even family oriented and hasn't developed deep relationships with your brothers.

Meanwhile, you deserved to celebrate at the wedding, but now you need to talk with wife about the deeper issues here.
