I don't look like I \"need\" my whole seat or any accomodations but if I don't get to change position every few minutes I'll have trouble walking by the time comes to get off the plane. It's SO IRRITATING the way people assume because your butt isn't occupying every inch of the seat that you ought to cede your territory.

This type of airline situation used to happen a lot when I was younger so I feel you. \n\nThe most notable occasion was when a flight attendant placed me between two people and they piped up and said they were looking for someone my size to sit there. They sat and laughed about all three of our sizes for a minute or so. I sat and wondered why it was that we had to be pitted against/with one another like that.\n\nthe answer is that airline seating isn't scaled properly at all.

The implication, whether you intended it or not, is that they don't eat right or exercise and maybe if they did they wouldn't be fat. That isn't always the case. Genetics do play a role as can health issues. Her using the word \"lucky\" was a figure of speech too, you took it too literally.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t being rude and you said you had plenty of space. Yes there are a lot of fat people that don\u2019t eat right or exceeded.

A LOT of factors play into it, many of which we don\u2019t get to control. And skinny or fat, there was no need for her to make a comment. Once she made her remark, you\u2019re free to say just about anything. If it were an issue, then maybe she shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it to begin with.", "NTA AT ALL. me and my friends talked about this in excess on our last vacation. The term \" must be nice\".

The woman harassing her could be like OP if they didn\u2019t decide to be a glutton. NTA.", "She was pretending to compliment OP by acting like something she works for is genetic. She was only near OP because her small size benefitted her, because she needed more than one seat. She was being really inappropriate.", "Yes. I had an ED in college, and mom died from anorexia in her 50s.  I am sensitive to everything weight related I guess.  OP here.  Phone has a different account pulled up.", "OP here.  Thx.  I meant I\u2019m sure that being tall sux in an airplane.   I was hammered my whole life on my weight.  Raised by a mom with an ED that died from it.  I see now I was triggered.", "ED sensitivity.  I really thought I had better control mentally.  Thank you.  OP here.  Phone uses a different account.", "When I was deeply struggling with amphetamine addiction, but before anyone in my life knew, multiple people commented on how great I looked now that I lost weight.

You're good.", "Sorry but YTA. You have no idea what's going on in someone else's body so don't pass judgment. My body decided in May to not accept food anymore except for a few fruits and veggies. Being overweight, great right? Nope. Gained even more weight than I had in the past two years. Drs aren't listening to me that something is wrong. Yes I'm fat and I feel terrible about it but I don't need other people's condescending attitude making me feel worse", "I would love to know the number of people here who successfully willed themselves to be 5 feet. No, that person would never have that body type.  While these people were dramatically different from one another, to argue that being a person\u2019s height and frame are a result of work is nonsense.", "So that\u2019s relevant info. You were responding from a place that is a harsh critique of the other and a defense of your body.  Everyone is struggling there - the other person opened the door and a better response and the teachable thing is that *it\u2019s not ok for people to comment on people\u2019s bodies.*. Instead of defending your habits and therefore judging people you\u2019re stuck sitting with but cannot educate about food and exercise, tell the truth: It\u2019s rude to talk about other people\u2019s bodies.", "sorry that you have gone through that, it\u2019s a very difficult thing to go though and you are very strong. however that doesn\u2019t excuse fat shaming especially if you have seen the negative effects of it your whole life", "So you decided to take all that personally? That makes you part of the problem. The lady on the airplane had no right to comment on anyone's body either, but she did, and she got what she dished out served back to her. Turnabout is absolutely fair play. Are fit people required to quetly put up with other people making ignorant remarks about them? Why are are the bodies of under- and over-weight people the only ones too sacred to be spoken of? Not one bit of that story was about you.\n\nIf you can't read comments like the above without feeling personally attacked, perhaps you should take a break from platforms like this until you've had a chance to deal with the things that are clearly overwhelming you.", "Nice job completely misunderstanding what I said. If you reread what I typed out nowhere did I say people can will themselves to be 5 foot. I said there are genetic variations in people such as height and frame. OP being 5 foot is a genetic disadvantage for her compared to the woman who was harassing who seems to be taller than her. Smaller people need to eat less calories than people who taller than them to maintain their weight as taller people will have more skeletal-muscle mass on their frame. As for the second part I am clearly talking about fitness levels. OP is fit cause they workout and eat properly. I\u2019m saying the second woman could also be fit if they worked out and ate properly; I did not say that they would magically turn into clones of each other.", "+1 to absolutely everything you are saying in this thread, ESPECIALLY calling out that the airline industry smushing everyone into tiny seats is the biggest AH of all here.", "This is one of the best comments I\u2019ve read, period. So well said and I really wish I\u2019d been clever enough to say as much many different times in my life. \n\nTo read every comment or post as if it is about yourself is painful, at least, and isn\u2019t fair to anyone.", "I didn\u2019t misunderstand you. \n\nYou replied to me and my comment is clearly about height, frame, and capacity to train - all things that do have significant genetic aspects and that DO factor into the original comment pertaining to the OP being \u2018lucky\u2019 for being tiny. \n\nOP\u2019s descriptions of belt extender etc are unnecessary to her response to the original but contributed to OP ratcheting it up. \n\n The other passenger was expressing her own self consciousness and projecting it onto OP and instead of behaving as if what the other passenger said was *not personal* - that is, it was inappropriate but not personal - OP confirmed for the other passenger that the other passenger *should* feel bad in that moment.  Do you believe that was a teachable time regarding fitness and health?  Does shaming teach? No.", "It wasn\u2019t a compliment. It was her assumption about you. That doesn\u2019t require a thank you.", "NTA, because she really shouldn\u2019t have committed on your body, that was very inappropriate.\n\nI do also just want to point out that not every person who is in a larger body is in that position because of their food and exercise choices. Fat people have EDs too.", "NTA - she is showing her own insecurities as a reflection on you. I'm heavy, but her comment was just plain rude!!!!", "YTA. Clearly from first sight, you expressed your distaste for the couple right down to their need for a seatbelt extender. Information was added which wasn't necessary only to show how athletic you are versus their obesity. You brought your air of superiority and need of adoration back to Reddit as if cutting her down was not enough. Get over yourself.", "NAH She shouldn\u2019t have mentioned your appearance. \n\nYou were a kind of rude & defensive to someone who was likely already uncomfortable flying. Flying while tall is uncomfortable, flying while overweight & tall is horrible. You win I guess.", "Why is it so hard to be grateful for things you can\u2019t control?  In that particular case, you WERE lucky.  You could have been a supermodel - super skinny, but also super tall, and your legs would have been crammed into who knows where.  Tell me exactly how \u201ctraining daily and eating the right food\u201d kept your height at five feet, giving your legs plenty of space in an airline\u2019s tiny area?\n\nNext time, just say \u201cthanks\u201d.  Anything else makes you sound like an AH."]}
