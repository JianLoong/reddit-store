My milk supply has been low so I've been pumping every 2-3 hours. The arrangement my husband and I agreed to was that he & I would both wake up for the first \"feeding/pump\" session, where he would go feed the baby a bottle and I would focus on pumping.\n\nThe issue is that my husband has insomnia & can't fall asleep easily. To mitigate this, I'll wear sleep headphones & will listen for the baby's cries when he's hungry; my husband's ask is for me to wake him up when this occurs, so that he can help and I can focus on pumping. \n\nHowever, when I do gently wake up my husband at the time that he asks me to, it's like a knee jerk reaction for him to be angry. He'll jerk, complain loudly that he just fell asleep minutes ago, slap the bed with his fist or open hand in anger, then stomp off to tend to the baby. After which, he'll cool off, start singing & put on his cute voice with the baby, & otherwise be \"okay.\" Meanwhile, I'm left feeling horrible, feeling guilty for waking him up, to the point where I don't want to wake him up because I'd rather just take care of everything myself than deal with him being pissy. \n\nLast night, I told him how these outbursts make me feel. That I'm afraid to wake him up because of them. His response was that this reaction is a reflex, no different to how a knee pops up when struck with a hammer, & that I need to just accept that this response is an inevitability.\n\nWell, it's 2am now. I wake him up, he does his same angry song and dance, and I go to pump. After he gets over his \"burst\", he comes out being positive & happy, trying to lightly joke about how this really pissed me off and that I really couldn't get over it. Admittedly, I tell him passive aggressively that I'm over it, but maintain a shortness with him.\n\nHe gets angry again, stating that of course, between the two of us, he's the one who can't sleep but I'M the one who's entitled to wear the angry bitch face. He takes the baby to the bedroom and slams the door. \n\nAfter he's done feeding the baby, I tell him that I'm going to sleep outside for the night and he asks me again to wake him up when the baby wakes up. He adds, verbatim,\n\"Can you just ignore my being mad for the first 15 seconds after you wake me up? I've done a good job here, and I feel like I'm owed that. I need you to be a big girl.\" \n\nI feel resentful of the fact that the burden is on me to \"get over\" his outbursts. However, I do also recognize that his bursts are short lived, and that he IS waking up to help me during an otherwise difficult time where both of us aren't getting sleep. He does do a great job of supporting us and my emotional well being during the rest of the day, so I may be the Asshole for harboring this resentment. I need some outside perspective on whether he has a point and if I should extend him owed grace for this issue.", "created_utc": 1699005286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mri7p/aita_for_being_resentful_of_my_husbands_reflexive/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or by leaving the baby monitor on loud on his nightstand and sleep elsewhere.\n\n& he's not \" waking up to help you\". He's waking up to be a parent to his child.", ">. I need you to be a big girl.\" \n\nLet me get this straight, your husband is gaslighting you into thinking you are the problem, becoming emotionally abusive when you explain his anger is an issue for you and then he infantilises you by acting like you're a child who needs to be placated cause you're not putting yourself in a situation where you feel uncomfortable?\n\nThis is the bit where I'd say the pretty red flags you're collecting are telling you to run.\n\nNta\n\nEditing to add: this is controlling behaviour, OP has already said she doesn't need him to get up and help, he has decided he has to. He's also laid the responsibility for getting him up on her as well, asking her to wake him up. So in the middle of the night OP has to get up for the baby, wake up hubby and pump and deal with the temper tantrum after having explained to him that she doesn't need him to get up at those times.", "NTA\n\nThis is the hardest time as new parents, and both of you have personal challenges adding to the difficulty! Both of you are exhausted and it's expected that patience will be thin and emotions will be more difficult to control. \n\nAs someone who has dealt with insomnia I can empathize with his despair of just having fallen asleep only to be woken. However, he shouldn't be using terms like \"big girl\" when you are expressing sensitivity to his reaction. \n\nHe should simply apologize each time to you if it really is involuntary. Tell him that your response to his outbursts are involuntary as well.", "I\u2019m going NTA here. Stop waking him up. The stress his anger (even though it is involuntary) is causing you is damaging. Tell him that he doesn\u2019t get to tell you to be a big girl when you are the one having to deal with his outbursts. You are sleep deprived and emotional for a very valid reason. This is making things worse for you. There are so many ways he can help - this way is not working for you and your emotional well-being.", "NTA.\n\n\"I need you to be a big girl\"? Trying to comprehend right now what would happen, if I got the idea to tell this to my girlfriend, when we are discussing a serious problem. How about \"being a big boy\" and learning some minimal level of self control? Anger management issues are not an immutable trait, they can be worked on.", "NTA. I reckon that his anger and the way it makes you feel might also affect your ability to feed baby or express!", "NTA - hubs needs to work on his \"waking up mantra\", otherwise he is going to leave you with PTSD.\n\nWhat is his reaction to the alarm clock going off in the morning to get up to go to work?", "\"I need you to be a big girl\"\n\nWTAF, I got so infuriated reading this, acting like you're the problem not him. I don't know how you kept your cool in that moment.\n\nNTA", "I think he needs to be a big boy and stop being an immature aggressive prick tbh. Why should you have to put up with that?? Hell no. NTA. Edit spelling", "Your husband is...not a good person.\n\nNTA.", "Sooo\u2026your husband won\u2019t regulate his own emotions, expects you to accommodate his emotional immaturity, called you a bitch, told you he \u201cneeds you to be a big girl\u201d(!!!!!!) but meant accommodate his morning tantrums, and expects praise for \u201chelping\u201d feed his child. Did I get everything? NTA\n\nYour husband is a whole ass grownup. You don\u2019t need to make allowances for his tantrums. He needs to get himself under control. Calling you a bitch is obviously awful but his big girl comment is just as bad as it\u2019s derisive and contemptuous. But also keep in mind again, he\u2019s making these derisive and contemptuous comments because he\u2019s mad you won\u2019t make allowances for his daily temper tantrums. \n\nDoes your husband normally blame you for his emotions and behavior?", "NTA\n\nWhat happens if in a few years he falls asleep on the couch. And your child accidentally wakes him up? Would it still be an involuntary reaction if your husband shouted or hit things in front of your child and scared them. Or hit your child instead-since he's admitted he can't control his angry outbursts. \n\nHonestly, I would stop waking him up. He doesn't get to gaslight and belittle you. He wants recognition for doing a good job when he can't even do it without being an angry abusive little boy.", "NAH.  I also get irrationally angry when I am woken up by someone (I have to use an alarm) and it lasts longer than 15 seconds.  I know it happens, but I'm not awake enough to actually understand what I am saying/what is going on.  However, that doesn't absolve me from apologizing for an outburst.\n\nUnfortunately, you need a change of nighttime feeding plans.  One option - stop waking him up.  I understand he may want some bonding time, but it's not worth the stress on you and the continued argument.  The other possibility could be to get up yourself, get out of the room and set off an alarm to go off a few minutes later.  That way he can be pissy by himself.  \n\n\nETA: I saw some recommendations that OP whisper or \"be nice\" during the wakeup.  DH tried that early on in our relationship and it just made it worse for me.  Others have talked about \"what about when husband falls asleep on the couch and gets woken up by the kid?\"  I also can't fall asleep on the couch because that leads to someone trying to wake me up.  I have tried to \"not be angry\" when someone wakes me up and it hasn't worked.  My alarm needs to be across the room so I have to get out of bed to snooze it.  I can do this and still basically be asleep.", "Bang a pot in his ear to wake his ass up, give him an actual reason to be angry. Maybe he'll find a way to give you less anxiety if you start giving him some. Make him as stressed to have you wake him up as you are waking him up... Maybe he'll find a way to grow up then. NTA", "NTA No jury in the world would convict you of murder after they heard about the 'be a big girl' comment", "NTA. Congrats on having two babies now. \n\nHe needs to control his emotions and not have a melt down about waking up. There\u2019s no excuse for that.", "Be a big girl? \n\nHas he considered being a big boy and stopping his little tantrums? You have a newborn. Sleep will suck. Getting pissy is not benefitting anyone. \n\nNTA, but those are fighting words to me. Have a tantrum and then tell me to be a big girl and get over it? Ain't no fucking way.", "Newborns are stressful. You're both exhausted to a level you've never experienced. His anger at your comments are over the top, but I disagree with others who say this is abusive. Especially since you say otherwise he is caring and supportive. NAH. Extend each other grace. His reaction is involuntary, and yours, while it can be difficult, can be controlled. Remember that babies feel stress, so breathe and think about your new gift. Blessings on the new baby!", "Every time he wakes up angry scream FUCK YOU in his face. \nIt\u2019s ok because you\u2019re doing it reflexively. \n\nNTA. His behaviour is disgusting.", "Nta-my husband was like this for years and was able to work on it. There are times where he\u2019s angry and gives me dirty looks but I know he\u2019s not actually awake when he\u2019s doing that- it\u2019s frustrating but he also isn\u2019t angry at me once he\u2019s actually waking up because he knows he asked me to wake him up. Your husband asking you to be a big girl is so gross and cringe.", "\u201cI need you to be a big girl\u201d?!?!?!?!\n\nHell no, OP. NTA. Your husband can\u2019t emotionally regulate himself and is acting like you are the one with the problem.", "NTA.\n\nI empathize with your husband because I also struggle with insomnia, but he is still clearly in the wrong here. His behavior is abusive (slapping things, yelling, then telling you it's not a big deal and you should get over it).\n\nIt's very much his choice to act like that - like I said, I also struggle with insomnia and I have never yelled at somebody or punched things when I was woken up. He knows it's bothering you deeply, but he didn't care to adjust his behavior at all.\n\nI really hope he is not emotionally abusive in other aspects of your marriage. I also hope that his outbursts don't affect your baby. Babys are more perceptive than many people realize, and behaving like that in front of a baby can (and probably will) scare them and give them attachment issues.", "NTA but I will say, those first few newborn weeks are fucking rough. Rough rough rough. The lack of sleep, the pain of breastfeeding, establishing a routine, finding yourself as a whole new person. It is all hard, on both of you. Give yourself, and him, some grace. \n\nBut with the actual issue at hand, it really seems the only option is either to not wake him or accept he\u2019s an AH when woken up. If he really can\u2019t help it, I don\u2019t know what other answer there is. \n\nWith my partner and I we quickly found both waking up together wasn\u2019t sustainable. With him working and me on leave, he would stay up for the first wake, usually around midnight, then get constant sleep until morning. I would go to bed early and be undisturbed until the second waking. I know you\u2019re trying to pump but I found the best time to pump was with a baby on one boob and a pump on the other, the milk would come much more easily than pumping with no baby. Could something like that work for you?", "NTA don\u2019t ever let him talk to you that way again. He already calls you a btch, so go berserk at him. Stand up for yourself. And interrupt him LOUDLY when he starts gaslighting you again. Tell him to gtfo with his psycho games.\n\nHe either takes you and your feelings seriously or he can leave. Bc atm you take care of 2 babies and have double stress due to his anger issues and manipulation afterwards. No one needs that.", "Obviously NTA. Your feelings 100% credible. But I am in the same position as your husband and I really don't know what to do. Obviously he's a grown man and he needs to understand the effect he's having on you because of his burst and be at least remorseful and try to tone it down.\n\nI'm a deep sleeper and I have a hard time falling asleep so when anybody wakes me up I get angry, I don't remember most of the stuff I say and even go back to sleep most of the times. My dad says I'm pretty agressive and he has stopped waking me up lol, ofc I apologise every time and I really don't do it wantedly, I don't even remember it.\n\nAlso please don't listen to these people commenting, saying this is a huge red flag and you gotta leave him. I'm sure you're wiser than that. This is deffo not the hill to die on", "NTA, but i do want to caution you from reading too much into people criticizing your husband's behavior. Yes he needs to work on his 'reflex' but at least he acknowledges that he needs to work on it. And all things considered, if he is able to flip from upset to being a calm parent for the baby that is pretty damn good.  Sorry, but as condescending as this laguage is \"I need you to be a big girl.\", it's the truth. You are going to deal with MUCH  worse than this feeding routine and you BOTH will do things that each other doesn't like and try each other's patience etc.\n\nTaking care of a newborn is a unique, and difficult experience for all new parents. Accepting each other's flaws and working on them is all you can both do.\n\nMy advice, keep your eye on the prize. Is a 15 second outburst about getting woke up fair to you, no. But are you otherwise getting done what needs to be done, you pump, he feeds the baby, and life moves on. That's what you focus on.  You (and other posters here) are acting like he wakes up, throws a fit, then rolls over and goes back to bed and tells you to deal with it. THAT would be a big problem.", "NTA. Based on the title and the line \u201che had insomnia\u201d I was 150% ready to go the other way, and even continued to go the other way through the majority of it. I too have insomnia and I get angry to the point of near tears when that alarm goes off. My reaction if very similar to his. \n\nMy vote flipped immediately when you described how he responded to you. WTAF?\n\nSo, I had this reaction every time my ex woke me up. We didn\u2019t have kids, but there were other things that would require fairly consistent wakeups like you describe. I could not control it or help it. He told me it bothered him. My response? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a knee jerk reaction and I can\u2019t control it. Don\u2019t wake me up anymore. He would wake up when it was necessary, go check to see if he could handle it solo. If he couldn\u2019t, he would run in, tell my phone to set a timer for two minutes, then he would go back to it. Two minute later my alarm went off, I\u2019d be angry and frustrated and all that for my 15-30 seconds, and then I\u2019d do what I had to do. He did not have to deal with that anymore. We both worked together to find a solution. \n\nYou did not ask him to get up; he wants to. \nYou do not want to wake him; he wants you to. \nYou do not want to see the outbursts; he wants you to. \nYou want to be heard; he wants you to, and to be \u201cgood\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of \u201che wants\u201d. Yes, he\u2019s a father who wants to be a father. You want to be able to get up and pump without the extra noise he brings to the table. \n\nI don\u2019t know you, but set an alarm right next to his head that sounds like a bullhorn. Leave the room and take care of baby. When the alarm goes off, he can cuss and punch the bed all he wants, you don\u2019t have to deal with it. If he throws the alarm against the wall, you can say \u201cthat\u2019s your knee jerk reaction that I\u2019m supposed to deal with every time. I won\u2019t do it. But a new alarm because you\u2019re mean when you first wake up.\u201d\n\nIf he says no, that\u2019s fine. HE decided that he\u2019ll stay asleep because you don\u2019t need that in your life, even if it\u2019s only 15 seconds. \n\nI tend to want to find a middle ground, compromise of situations rather than jump to drastic measures to take as a first step, because only you know if those drastic measures are useful in your own relationship, and sometimes they\u2019re not and you just need a compromise. The compromise you offer is that he has to wake up without you. If that means putting the baby monitor into his eardrum, then that\u2019s what HE has to do. He is responsible for waking up. He is responsible for his knee jerk reaction. He is responsible for his behavior. You are responsible for getting up and loving your baby in a way that makes you both happy and peaceful. \n\nYou do not have to \u201cget over\u201d anything. He has to man up. \n\nDo not let him convince you otherwise. \n\nIf he ignores or refuses the compromise, you can decide from there if you want to go with the drastic measures. But at that point, his behavior does raise 5 trillion red flags.", "You. Need. To. Run. \n\nYou have bigger fish to fry than posting here.\n\nThis anger, in the wake of doing something he has specifically requested of you, is abuse. Slapping and punching the bed (or any furniture or wall etc) is both an act of physical violence and a demonstration to you of his capacity for violence. His getting further angry at your response is manipulative. Him telling you that resolving this issue is a you problem instead of his responsibility shows you that he\u2019s going to get worse.\n\nDon\u2019t bother with marriage therapy, he\u2019ll just use it to learn your fears so he can use them against you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that this man is the true person, the man you thought you married was an actor who pretended to be someone else in order to trick you into marrying him and letting him father your child. Get yourself safe.", "NTA\n\n>Meanwhile, I'm left feeling horrible, feeling guilty for waking him up, to the point where I don't want to wake him up because I'd rather just take care of everything myself than deal with him being pissy. \n\n\nThat's the point. He's expecting you to stop expecting for him to take turns. I'd stop waking him up because this definitely seems passive aggressive.", "NTA. I have insomnia and take sleeping medication. I still don't act like an asshole if I get woken up. It's uncalled for. If he thinks you should be a big girl, maybe he should be a big boy and not act like a fucking teenager being woken up for school. \n\nMan, if my husband told me to be a big girl he'd be sleeping somewhere else. So disrespectful.", "ESH. In my experience it is a normal knee jerk reaction and to fair to him, he is turning it around right away. He needs to cut the condescending crap though. He\u2019s getting angry with you for something he\u2019s asked you to do. Even if that\u2019s uncontrollable and he stops right away, he needs to make up for it.\n\nAs an example, I have a policy of \u201cI\u2019m leaving the room straight away and then I\u2019ll put my smile on and come back to be normal.\u201d That\u2019s what a big boy does, not pretend it doesn\u2019t matter.", "It does sound involuntary, so I'm not sure what he can do about it? If he was banging around being stroppy while he was with the baby he would completely be the AH, but it doesn't sound like this is the case. 15 seconds isnt thst long, walk away. I'm going to gently call you a tiny AH, but only because you made me choose. \nHave you sought advice on the best way to increase your milk supply? It is completely your decision to feed your baby with whatever method you want, but back when I did it I was told a baby would always drain better than a pump, so it was much harder to increase supply while pumping.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\nWhy can't your husband be a 'Big Boy' and get over himself? Insomnia sucks, the newborn stage (at least in terms of sleep deprivation) sucks but you know what sucks most of all? Him. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around his temper, ever. It is his responsibility to get a handle on himself and he is failing.", "Nta and this is abuse", "He is causing you trauma. In my experience, you could develop PTSD from his outbursts. Sorry if I sound extreme, but your brain will learn to be in fight/flight whenever you need to wake him. This is not fair on you, or your baby. Good luck getting him to take responsibility for himself as an adult. X", "NAH I can fully understand not wanting to wake him up in this case and feeling negative about your husband. I also understand his side about it being involuntary. Is there a solution where you stop sleeping with the headphone where only you hear the baby cry for the first feeding session ? That way you don't feel responsible for his bad mood ?", "NAH, get formula and supplement - you will do both of yourselves in. \n\nGood luck", "[deleted]", "I would say a bit of both. \n\nBeing angry or upset at what appears to be his involuntary outburst is a you issue. Seems like he\u2019s been like this and it\u2019s not something to take personally. Granted it leaves you feeling off but you don\u2019t have to associate your request and his outburst. So don\u2019t take it on. You choose your reaction. And yes I know it\u2019s easier said than done\n\nThe second part \u201cbe a big girl\u201d that makes him the ah. Because you\u2019ve addressed it with him as it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not so easy to ignore or not associate the outburst to your request and the off putting feeling is causing you anxiety. That anxiety is messing with your milk production and therefore compounding the already stressful feeding scenario the two of you are working out. He\u2019s putting all the responsibility on you to resolve this issue and it\u2019s a two person job.\n\nAnd as a side note he\u2019s not \u201chelping you\u201d getting up with the baby, participating in feeding, changing, all things baby related is just as much his job as it is yours. If you didn\u2019t produce any milk and/or bottle fed (which it sounds like you\u2019re doing) he is just as responsible to get up and feed the baby anytime day or night, regardless how it happens.

My milk supply has been low so I've been pumping every 2-3 hours. The arrangement my husband and I agreed to was that he & I would both wake up for the first \"feeding/pump\" session, where he would go feed the baby a bottle and I would focus on pumping.\n\nThe issue is that my husband has insomnia & can't fall asleep easily. To mitigate this, I'll wear sleep headphones & will listen for the baby's cries when he's hungry; my husband's ask is for me to wake him up when this occurs, so that he can help and I can focus on pumping. \n\nHowever, when I do gently wake up my husband at the time that he asks me to, it's like a knee jerk reaction for him to be angry. He'll jerk, complain loudly that he just fell asleep minutes ago, slap the bed with his fist or open hand in anger, then stomp off to tend to the baby. After which, he'll cool off, start singing & put on his cute voice with the baby, & otherwise be \"okay.\" Meanwhile, I'm left feeling horrible, feeling guilty for waking him up, to the point where I don't want to wake him up because I'd rather just take care of everything myself than deal with him being pissy. \n\nLast night, I told him how these outbursts make me feel. That I'm afraid to wake him up because of them. His response was that this reaction is a reflex, no different to how a knee pops up when struck with a hammer, & that I need to just accept that this response is an inevitability.\n\nWell, it's 2am now. I wake him up, he does his same angry song and dance, and I go to pump. After he gets over his \"burst\", he comes out being positive & happy, trying to lightly joke about how this really pissed me off and that I really couldn't get over it. Admittedly, I tell him passive aggressively that I'm over it, but maintain a shortness with him.\n\nHe gets angry again, stating that of course, between the two of us, he's the one who can't sleep but I'M the one who's entitled to wear the angry bitch face. He takes the baby to the bedroom and slams the door. \n\nAfter he's done feeding the baby, I tell him that I'm going to sleep outside for the night and he asks me again to wake him up when the baby wakes up. He adds, verbatim,\n\"Can you just ignore my being mad for the first 15 seconds after you wake me up? I've done a good job here, and I feel like I'm owed that. I need you to be a big girl.\" \n\nI feel resentful of the fact that the burden is on me to \"get over\" his outbursts. However, I do also recognize that his bursts are short lived, and that he IS waking up to help me during an otherwise difficult time where both of us aren't getting sleep. He does do a great job of supporting us and my emotional well being during the rest of the day, so I may be the Asshole for harboring this resentment. I need some outside perspective on whether he has a point and if I should extend him owed grace for this issue.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes, I'm in touch with my lactation specialist, and I made the decision after trying with latching not to continue, mostly because my anxiety of stressing over whether the baby was getting enough milk was counter productive, and also because that would require triple feeding (latching, bottle feeding, and pumping) which was really impacting my ability to get any sleep and I felt like I was breaking down. \n\nThanks for your perspective. I do get that the anger is involuntary, and I recognize that it is difficult for me to \"get over it\". Part of me does want to just let it go, and another part of me thinks \"If I had a daughter whose husband did this to her, would I tell her to just swallow her feelings too?\"", "Insane judgement. Anger is never an involuntary response, he needs to learn to control it. Why is it okay just because he doesn't display it in front of the baby, it's fine that clearly OP's feelings mean jack sh\\*t to him?

The issue is not what they are being fed.", "Hell no. You don't just dump your shit on your partner, then straggle off making them feel horrible and tell them to be a \"big girl\". If him being angry is \"involuntary\", then her being upset about it is as well.", "\"Most fathers are bad at caring for their children\" isn't a great point of comparison. I agree OP's husband is generally doing a good job, though, but he should be able to calmly discuss with his partner that his response to being woken up is stressing her out during a stressful time. She's going through a lot at the moment with the breastfeeding - feeling like you can't produce enough milk to feed your child is incredibly depressing.\n\nI was in a similar situation a few nights ago where I woke my husband because the baby needed changing and I desperately needed the loo. She often feeds for a long while afterwards so I couldn't hold it, and he reflexively snapped at me because he hadn't had a lot of sleep and had a headache. I explained that I was surprised at his reaction and it made me feel like I couldn't ask him for help. He apologized and said he hadn't meant to upset me and he would try his hardest not to do it again. That, to me, is a reasonable response.\n\nIf OP's husband really does try (lying in silence while breathing through the anger and maybe just a grunt to let her know he's awake) and it doesn't work then maybe it's time for OP to \"put up with it\".

Do you expect her to pump and feed at the same time?", "Same (except only 2). Pumping never worked very well for me. I just got up and breastfed them. It's also wonderful bonding with your baby & no need for dad to get up.", "At least then the tirade is for a good reason lmao", "Came here to say this!!", "Yes!

He would get angry when I woke him up because his phone was ringing or he had to get up for work and it went from angry temper tantrums and hitting to bed to hitting *me* that was a short lived relationship of 4 hours after the first time he did that.", "I'm wondering how it would be in a few years when the kid wakes mammy and daddy because of a nightmare. \n\nImagine putting your kid through it.", "Yup", "Every woman who has ended up in a physically abusive relationship has had the thought, \"But he would never hit me.\"", "Wrong. He is the problem, she just grew an entire human and he needs to. Ring his A game. If she can get out, this might force him to grow up and deal with his issues.

I don't think either of them are communicating at their best and they need to go back to the drawing board on how to handle nighttime feedings during the day when they're not in the middle of dealing with the issue. But in no way is this breakup worthy if it's not a pattern of behavior far outside this one issue\n\nAlso I do think he has a point in the sense that it's at least very hard to alter behavior that's happening in the twilight zone between being asleep and awake bc I don't think awake brain is controlling that response. But I'd like to see him look for some alternate way for him to wake up that doesn't put op in this position, as opposed to just telling her to get over it\n\nAnd both of them seriously need to drop the sarcasm and passive aggressive shit", ">That's not what gadlighting is.\n\nThat's good, I don't know what \"gadlighting\" is but I know what gaslighting is and that's what this is.", ">do it by yourself, pump and feed.\n\nYou clearly missed the part where she has said she wants to do it herself AND HE WONT LET HER.", "In both cases the person might reflexively feel angry, which they can't help, but neither case provides an excuse to take that anger out on others. PMS is an excuse for moody behavior during puberty, as people learn how to regulate themselves. But if women were rude and awful once a month, people wouldn't put up with it. \nIt's the same situation here. It's OK to feel angry or grumpy, but not OK to throw a fit about it. He is an adult.

Attitude for a minute or two while I get my bearings and him with a flight or fight reaction). I really could believe that he's not really in control those first few seconds.\n\nBut his comments were condescending and unnecessary. He may be tired but she is still vulnerable post delivery. To talk to her like that when she is voicing valid concerns? There's no excuse for it", "Came here to say this. The stress his outburst creates in your body is contributing to your supply issues. And also, he isn\u2019t doing you a favor by getting up to feed the baby, it\u2019s called being a parent. Does he think you WANT to wake up to pump? He needs to take responsibility for himself and get himself up instead of put that extra work on you, especially if this is how he reacts to being woken up. You actually need more rest than he does right now, sleep is another factor in your body producing prolactin.\n\nTo use his own way of speaking- time for him to put on his big boy pants, you should only be taking care of one child right now, not two.", "THIS. He's being super manipulative and abusive. I've never heard of this BS \"reflex\" he seems to have. I think he's doing it intentionally.", "If he can't control himself, he should sleep in another room, leave his phone on loud, and you can call his phone when he needs to be woken up.

If the outburst genuinely is involuntary, it should be fine for him get shitty by himself in a separate room.", "How does he get up for work etc?", "OP, this is shitty behavior that benefits him, allows him to abuse you and gaslight that you are the problem.

What happens if/when he \"accidentally\" hits you and not the mattress?", "NTA, and no, you wouldn't tell your daughter to just swallow her feelings if a man treated her the way her father is treating you. He is bullying you in the middle of the night. His immediate sensation of anger when woken may be involuntary, but what he does with that, his actions and his words, those he can control.

You are doing the definition of Einstein's insanity - you know this way doesn't work, yet you keep doing it over and over. You NEED to do something different, obviously - suggestions have been offered here, like leaving the room and setting an alarm for a minute later so he can have his reactive time in private. And a sleep specialist may have even better suggestions! And he needs to empathize with how his behaviors, uncontrollable or not, affect you.
