They are not \"legally married\" but are considered common law.\n\nDespite living together they have always filed their taxes as single which made it so Alexa got GST from CRA.  When they had their first child they continued to file as single which made it so Alexa got a lot more from CRA for the Child Tax Benefit and for the Affordable Childcare Benefit.  When they had their second child Alexa lied on her Affordable Childcare Benefit renewal and said she was still working which was why she needed daycare.  Before she had gone on maternity leave I did tell her she had to tell the Affordable Childcare Benefit people right away because I hadn't and had to pay back the two months difference when I did update my file.\n\nOnce Alexa came back to work she would brag to EVERYONE about how much money she got from the government.  She isn't a good person, she constantly calls in sick, is rude and unkind to everyone, and all around is not an ethical person.

My brother got caught up in something very similar, his wife (gf at the time) was on welfare while he was in jail. After he got out she stayed on welfare even though they were together (relevant because they had a toddler). For years it was like that, then it finally caught up to my brother & the state charged him for like 7 years of back child support, six of those years he was actively in a relationship & living with her & raising his kids. Despite being a moron he\u2019s actually a pretty good dad, but they\u2019re still paying it off even though their kids are both in hs now. So it\u2019s all fun and games until you get caught.

If they had been entitled to the money, the investigation would have turned up nothing. \n\nThe fact that they found 20k worth of fraud is a sign that you did the right thing.
