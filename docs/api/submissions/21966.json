We\u2019ve been working on building a relationship but it\u2019s been\u2026 interesting. For lack of a better word. \n\nTo clarify- I did not move here to be close to him. I moved here because it doesn\u2019t snow, my kid (6f6 has better opportunities and so do I. \n\nTo preface, he and I weren\u2019t talking for the duration of this time. We started back speaking in the day before Super Bowl 2023. Anyway, he allowed his other daughter  (33f), her kids (11M and 14M, and her friend (32f) live with him rent free for almost a year. When he finally kicked her out he paid his rent fine in February but had struggles paying March and April. His complex worked with him but he was still behind for the upcoming month. Well he got behind again for May and June and started blaming them for him being behind. It made no sense. How are people who left in January responsible for your rent being late in JUNE? \n\nEither way, last month he got really, REALLY close to being evicted. The judge had ordered it and as of 7/5 he was to be served with a writ of restitution. I had previously told him in March/April when he was going through this that staying at my house was not an option. I live in a 1br apt with my daughter (6f) and my friend/roommate (46f). We simply don\u2019t have space. Not to mention, when they left, they left such a big mess that he ended up having roaches. BIG NO FOR ME! \n\nMy dads brother (57M) called me saying my dad had told him if he was to be kicked out, he was coming to stay with me. I was proud of myself because as angry as I was I simply said \u201cno tf he\u2019s not. He better figure out how to stay in his own apartment.\u201d\n\nTo make a long story short, he absolutely figured it out and is still in his apt. But was I the AH for telling him coming to my house wasn\u2019t an option? \n\nSummary: my dad let his other daughter, her kids, and her friend live with him rent free for almost a year. When he was getting evicted sometime after they left, I told him he couldn\u2019t come stay at my house. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the comments. I really just needed an outside perspective. Being raised by a narcissistic single mom & step dad AND having a narcissistic bio dad (not even knowing this or much about him until 26 yrs old) has been a whirlwind and I have this habit of second guessing myself for \u201cfeeling bad.\u201d I\u2019m only learning these things and what they mean now in my 30s. So to the person who commented saying I\u2019m \u201cproud\u201d that I\u2019d let my dad be homeless: he also tried to guilt trip me into letting him stay with me by saying he\u2019d kill himself if he was evicted. And it actually has nothing to do with \u201cletting him be homeless;\u201d he made that decision when he decided not to pay his rent. However, I am proud of myself for finally putting myself first for once. Unfortunately for him, this situation was what it took for me to set a boundary and stand on it. And to the person who said he should go stay with the other daughter, that conversation didn\u2019t go well when I suggested it lol I was definitely the AH for that one though.

He doesn't get to take from you to compensate for his bad judgement in over-giving to someone else. That is a very good boundary to have. If you do otherwise, the over-giver you are enabling, who has a habit of giving more than he can afford, will simply factor your resources into what's available for him to give out. Whether you have what you need, when and how you need it, isn't a blip on his radar screen.\n\nYour dad obviously can't afford this lease. Renting more apartment than he could afford to accommodate a different kid and that kid's family was bad judgement on his part. He needs to manage his money better, or try to get on a subsidized housing list if he's low income.", "NTA. He is basically just a friendly acquaintance.  He did not parent you, he did not support you, he was not a part of your life in any way shape or form when it mattered most. Just because you are in contact with him now - does not automatically confer ANY 'kinship benefits' to him with regard to calling 'dibs' on your sofa. You are an independent adult, with responsibilities and a child, and you do NOT need to take on ANY more burdens than you want to, regardless of his 'emergency'. There is no shame in this, there is no obligation on your part. Stand firm in your 'NO' and don't worry one bit about this.", "NTA...There's no logical reason to house him.

I get he wasn\u2019t in the picture so you don\u2019t feel the same obligations others might and that\u2019s fine, but weird thing to be proud about, especially when you also say you\u2019ve been attempting to reestablish a relationship\u2026", "NTA. You are not responsible for his bad decision. Also he has only been back in your life for a few months so you don't owe him anything.", "I agree. A few months, a few years, her whole life, if she isn't comfortable with it, and she plainly let him know, it's an easy NTA from me.\n\nEdited for grammar.", "She can work on establishing a relationship AND enforce her boundaries at the same time.

The consequence of her boundary is dad being homeless. I\u2019m not even saying she should let her dad stay if she really doesn\u2019t have that relationship, but a little nuance wouldn\u2019t kill ya. Clearly the consequence of her boundary hurts the relationship with the dad. The two are at odds."]}
