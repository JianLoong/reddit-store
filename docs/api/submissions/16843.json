The wedding is going to be a childless wedding, which is something we've previously discussed with our guests and we gave a few months notice so everyone with children had the opportunity to find a babysitter, leave them with friends, etc. I've had too many nightmare stories about children at weddings, including first-hand experience, and I am not going to deal with someone's inability to control their toddler. \n\nMy sister was also involved in the planning part - so she knew about the childess policy. Now for some reason she brought up the idea that her son, who's 7, could take care of the rings. I asked her if she forgot about the fact that the wedding is going to be childless. She said she knows that but since it's my nephew I should allow him to be there and she wouldn't feel happy about attending my wedding without him. I was admittedly more pissed than I needed to be, but I stayed firm and said:\n\n \"I don't care if he's my nephew. This wedding is not appropriate for him\" \n\nApparently this was too much because now she's extremely mad at me and refusing to join us at all.

She should have at least asked if you were amenable to the idea, but she is not entitled to force you to include him.", "Of course you're NTA.  She's being an entitled mom.\n\nIf it would help, remind her that when people make exceptions at childfree weddings, all hell can break loose, because it brings out the mama bear in some people.  \"My kid wasn't good enough?!?\"\n\nBesides, young kids, esp boys, rarely get stoked by this stuff. She's doing it to enhance herself and her role.\n\nPS - I do agree with others that you did the \"dramatic title\" thing, maybe trying to make your question more interesting.", "NAH and she just won't come. But you won't avoid the drama.", "NTA - if you decide to get upset at her not doing it\u2019ll be another story, i understand the no child policy as it\u2019s something i wish to do as well and won\u2019t be including close members if theyre young.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t say you didn\u2019t care about him, just that you don\u2019t care that he\u2019s your nephew.

Let her be mad you let EVERYONE know what you want and don\u2019t want at your wedding. They can either respect that or not attend.", "NAH. You're allowed to not have children at your wedding, she's allowed to not attend because of it.", "ESH \n\nShe should have pushed for him to attend when she knows it's a child free wedding.\n\nBut you can't hold a childfree wedding and get annoyed at parents who can't or who chose not to attend.", "You have the right to plan a childless wedding.

Yes.  \n\nYTA", "NTA but you're sister sounds like one of those who worships her child's farts, so the fact that you started a sentence with I don't care if he is my nephew is what pissed her off.

Accept the fact that neither will be there and have a great wedding.", "I don\u2019t know that your the TA but you definitely should know whether your nephew would be a problem or not and have the ability to make an exception if he\u2019s a got a decent head on his shoulders. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine excluding my nephew from such a big moment of my life but at the end of the day it\u2019s your day so it\u2019s within your rights.

Seems like she was being tactical in this and hoped that giving you less time to consider it that her kicking up a stink would change your feelings.\n\nIn any case, it's a problem with your sister because she thinks being your sister and him being your nephew makes them an exception.", "NTA and he can go to your next one.", "In the grand scheme of things, YTA. It's one child who is immediate family. He is 7, not an \"uncontrollable toddler.\" Your parents and siblings are going to have these wonderful family photos with one important person missing.

Your title is misleading, though. You didn't say you don't care about your nephew, you said him being your nephew doesn't negate your policy.", "NTA.  Your sister needs to put her assumptions away, get a babysitter, and come to your wedding.  Sure, it would be a shock at first if sis was thinking all along that somehow her little angel would be the one child of all the children that was exempt from the childless wedding.  But, she failed to read the big print, \"Childless Wedding\".

She's not an AH for not having him at the wedding or in the wedding party, but who the hell talks about their own little nephew so coldly?  The title alone made me cringe.

FFS, how do you talk about a child who came out of your own sibling like they're some random kid from down the street?", "Yes she did ,was gonna say that", "She is not the asshole because she is not attending.

It will be her loss.", "NTA. It's completely understandable of your wants. Remain firm. How many kids want to go to a wedding anyway? As an adult, I still hate them as much as when I was a kid and would beg not to go only to be forced to dress up, smile and not put my elbows on the table while we ate. Even if he wanted to go, tough. If she decides not to go to your wedding because she can't have *her* way on your big day, oh well.

I don't really understand it, my other relatives also took care of their kids - why is it a problem with my sister?\n\nI think that she sees her son as important part of her family and if you do not care about him, then your part of family is less important. Like I said, she pressuring you to have son there is wrong, you taking any offense at all for her not going subsequently is wrong too.", "NTA", "NTA/NAH. She shouldn't ask to bring her son but you shouldn't get mad at her if she decides not to attend - that's the risk when you throw a childfree event.", "Click bait", "Just because it's a child from a sibling doesn't make it any different to any other child.
