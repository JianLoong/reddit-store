I don't want it there, but it's not as simple as just giving it back to him because he isn't supposed to own guns at the moment (long story, not particularly relevant). I finally told him to not worry about it, I would have it transferred to my name and deal with it myself. Then as soon as we got home, my aunt brought it back up and started saying we could transfer it to her name and they would check it at the airport. I said, \"Don't worry about it, we settled it. I am going to take care of it.\" And she immediately blew up about how I didn't need to butt into the conversation (which I think is just ridiculous considering she was inserting herself into a resolved issue between my dad and I). She claimed I had a horrible attitude and she was sick of it. I tried to defend myself, but she just kept yelling at me, so I snapped and told her to shut up. I started going off about how she was a guest in my house, and she wasn't going to yell at and berate me over nothing. She couldn't give me any actual examples of how my attitude was bad, just that it was a \"vibe.\" I really did not understand where this was coming from as I hadn't been in a bad mood at all.

I am not going to be treated like this in my own house, let alone on the day of my graduation.

You did perfectly fine - doesn't sound like you missed any social cues, and your boundaries are all great. Aunt was being odd and rude.

In my opinion, something always can be done better to avoid heated arguments like that, but since she couldn't even give you an example what you did wrong, it seems like she just doesn't respect you or give a duck about your feelings. Or she just can't treat you like an equal adult because of you being on the spectrum.IMO,  Your autism has nothing to do with this particular situation (at least from what you described) and even if it had - it's your house, your rules.", "NTA.

This was your special time and your aunt tried to ruin it. It sounds like she may be resentful of your success, and also that she thought she could treat you like a child and disregard your decisions because you're autistic. Also sounds like she wanted the gun for herself and had a tantrum when it was clear she wasn't going to get it. The family rift is not your doing, it's hers.

There were no major events before this, really. She just said I had a bad attitude without any actual examples. The only one I can personally think of is the morning before the graduation when she kept insisting on letting her walk my dog, but I kept telling her no because I already had and didn't want to wake her up since she was already settled down enough for us to leave. That seemed to make her angry for some reason.", "Unfortunately when standing your ground and maintaining boundaries, your going to have to accept that sometimes everyone or no one is going to agree with you. They might try to pressure you into \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d but you may have to stand your ground. Eventually everyone will just let it go/get over it and if people want to be petty and be involved in something that\u2019s got nothing to do with them then the best thing you can do is not give any energy to the situation. Make your position clear and firmly but respectfully explain that the situation is in the past and you have nothing more to say regarding it. Eventually people will let it go.", "Your aunt can\u2019t give you examples because you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. Your aunt just doesn\u2019t like you. I had a situation at a job similar. I was talked to by the boss that everyone felt like they had to walk on eggshells around me but couldn\u2019t give me an example of what I was doing. The boss got frustrated and brought another employee into it and he also couldn\u2019t tell me what I was doing which meant I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong they just didn\u2019t like me. A few years later and damn near completely new crew, one of the Assistant Managers (I was one as well) came to me angry because I was trash talking them. I asked what I said and she couldn\u2019t tell me specifics because nobody had told her. She brought someone else in and he repeated my exact words then told me how it came across to people which was different than what I meant. That time I was definitely in the wrong but I could be told exactly what I was doing. If you\u2019re wrong then there\u2019s always examples as to why.", "Going no contact/low contact with family members that bring unnecessary drama to your life is a guilty pleasure of mine.", "Sounds like she wanted the gun for herself", "NTA clearly.
