The referral gets your wife to the attention of HR to get the first interview. That\u2019s pretty valuable. It also gets her inside coaching on what the company is like and what it\u2019s looking for so she can make an informed decision wether or not it\u2019s right for her.

It directly impacts her career.

They get their employees to screen candidates and recommend good ones because it saves on their recruitment costs and reduces the likely hood of the new hire being a bad fit for the company/role and/or leaving for a competing job offer.

You did all the hardwork with your comment.", "YTA. The referral bonus is essentially meant to cover some of costs that would otherwise be put to the recruitment process, which an employee has basically just done the work for.", "YTA- I have never heard of a referral bonus being shared. The company is paying Hannah for bringing them a qualified candidate. It\u2019s not a hiring bonus for your wife.", "Dude...sharing referral bonus is not a fucking thing. I'm pretty sure most companies prohibit it. She got the JOB because of her friend. So the company offers referral bonuses as a way to build their staff? What else do you want from Hannah? A gold brick? A new house? A Ferrari? Maybe you wanna be able to go and shit in Hannah's toilet too? Geeze. Who expects to get paid for getting hired? Also, how do you know that Hannah doesn't need it? YTA, and a big fat entitled one at that.", "YTA she stuck her neck out for your wife.", "Haha whaat? Yeah - YTA. That's not a normal practice.", "Huge YTA. Hannah is getting the money for helping the company fill an open position.\n\nYour wife gets paid salary for filling that position. She did no extra work here, she is just working.", "YTA \n'referrals' get looked at first for hire it's completely possible that without her friends referral, your wife wouldn't have been hired because she would have been competing at the base level as everyone else. It's even possible she may not have even gotten an interview. \n\nReferral bonuses aren't usually shared. You can share them if you really want to, but honestly in this economy every penny counts and with the holidays just paint Hannah could probably have needed the money and even if she didn't it doesn't matter because it's HER money. \n\nDon't be a child OP, don't potentially cost your wife her job or make her feel like an outcast at work", "Yes, imagine if it was a thing, people would just abuse the system.", "I bet if the money was shared then OP would help himself to it bc it\u2019s his wife and he told her to ask so he deserves some.", "Internal referrals are often the golden ticket to get noticed. I had someone refer me for a job. I was hired. To celebrate getting past my trial period my husband and I took him and his wife out to dinner. \n\nI then referred someone. The company had finished all their interviews and gave my former co-worker a courtesy interview. They hired her that day. She took me to dinner. It\u2019s been two years and I\u2019m seen as a genius for referring her.", "Yeah same. I referred a friend's wife, and we joked about how I owed them drinks when we first were talking about it.

Lol", "My manager literally told me out of 70 applicants HR only forwards him like 3 resumes to review", "Yup \n\nA referral rarely gets someone a job, but it absolutely gets them past the keyword resume search which is a really big deal. \n\nAs an applicant, I always wondered if my resume went into a black hole. As a hiring manager, I know now that they did.", "Yeah for any big company nowadays it's like the hardest part is just getting actual human eyes on your application.  Parsing program sees you don't meet the keyword threshold?  REJECTED", "An absolute narcissistic nightmare.", "And, honestly, referrals *do* often become the deciding factor between two equally good candidates. The assumption is that hiring someone who already comes recommended by a current employee both eases the transition period for the new employee and gives the company some measure of security that the employee will work out.

They never actually asked me about him before they hired him. While he was a friend, I told him if he did that, I would be honest and say that I wouldn't hire him. (Good friend, poor worker and a history of clashing with management at every job they worked). \n\nHR told me they hired him and I'd be up for the bonus if he stayed for 3 months and I refused because I didn't want my name tied to him and would not have given a strong recommendation. HR was a little shocked by this (Way to do your homework)  His department manager and I were quite close (and I was quite valued at that job). She talked to me after what I said to HR and I just told her \"Do what you have to do to run your department. If you have to get rid of him, I'd understand\" He got fired 6 weeks later for repeated no-shows of shifts (So wouldn't have actually gotten it anyways).", "Lol yup. My former best friend really wanted me to refer her college friend for a job where I worked.

I don't want that hanging over my head if things go poorly.", "Just what I was thinking. Hes a greedy man this one.", "Yeah I knew this person would ask again if they got hired. There were a few reasons I declined (mainly because I knew I was going to be leaving that job anyway so I would never see the second half of the payout even if they were successful) but that was part of it too. \n\nThere are a few people I would consider referring if they asked, but generally I don\u2019t want the responsibility of them having to be a good hire lol.", "Probably. If she was good enough to hire, her resume likely would have caught their attention as well.", "Sure it might but being referred by a current employee certainly called attention to her and was a point in her favor. Just like a good reference. Definitly might have given her an edge over a similarly qualified candidate.", "YTA this sound similar to a placement consultant or recruiters fee and I have never heard of this fee being shared with the recruit. Stop being greedy.", "Yta but I don't agree with others saying that the referral bonus is not normally shared. I've referred several people and been referred myself and the bonus has ALWAYS been shared.", "Shared? Nah", "If someone got a sign on bonus, would OP expect them to share it with the person that referred them?", "I\u2019m an RN and I feel like bonus sharing is definitely a thing in healthcare.

It usually goes something like \u201chey my unit is hiring, it\u2019s pretty great, if you apply and get hired I\u2019ll split the referral with you\u201d.", "This. OP, are you trying to ruin this job opportunity for your wife or just ruin her relationship with her friend? Either way, you're in the wrong. I've never heard of anyone sharing a referral bonus. Be quiet. Your wife chose how to handle this, accept her decision. Or if you're trying to sabotage your wife, find a less obvious way to do it. Kidding! Just don't ruin the life of someone you're supposed to love!", "Sharing the referral bonus was sort of a thing for a few very high turnover jobs that were ALWAYS looking for people (one was an inbound, but shitty call center, one was factory work).  The company would just give equal amounts to both the refer-er and refer-ee after the probation period.", "I had an acquaintance try to claim I was referring them and put me in the awkward position of saying nope, I had never meant to refer anyone for the open headcount because this acquaintance never asked if I would in the first place.  Needless to say, connection severed and that person did not get an interview.", "As long as the person doing the referring has a good rep. Theyd probably look at it anyway but I could see people trashing resumes referred by bad employees.", "Yeah, that's more of a thing, if the company gives it to both", "What a cheap ass he is. He must embarrass her all of the time with similar ideas.", "I agree! If the bonus was meant to be \"shared,\" then the employer would split it between the two. Instead, they give it to the person who is supposed to get it, you know, the one who is also paying taxes on it! How dumb and entitled is this shitwit? I would end any relationship if someone asked me for half a bonus check for the simple fact I do not hang out with entitled idiots. \ud83d\ude24", "Oh, I've had hiring managers decline to interview them, sure.

The finders bonus is absolutely nothing to do with his partner let alone HIM. What on earth is going on here?!

They presume that you won\u2019t want to refer someone who won\u2019t be an acceptable employee. Of course, sometimes things like your situation happen. I have friends I wouldn\u2019t refer to jobs either because I know their work ethic isn\u2019t up to par.

And they ask you to ask you to refer hem to your boss at an entry level position if you've been a great employee yourself and have some sway..... What do you say? I know what I've said, but I'd love to know how you've crossed this bridge because whenever I go back to that job, I worry this friend will ask... So far they've asked just after people have been hired (or in one case, they saw the job opening that was specifically opened only for me to come back temporarily.... But because it's a big company and an entry level position they have to have me apply each time I come back *which they know from before applying would be temporary while I'm in the area and the first time I was hired I was there for several years*)", "You tell your boss your friend may have used you as a reference.
