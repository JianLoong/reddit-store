Maybe instead of a third outside job, you might consider spending a few hours in YOUR BUSINESS's office, taking a look at the books, seeing if there is more that the 'owners' could do vs. paying someone that much... (The 2k a week does seem high - that is unless your hubby and bro just sit at desks and let that person do all the work, bring in clients, etc.) Or maybe finding out it is a sinking ship and the credit cards racked up are proof they aren't doing well...maybe your hubby is taking on the debt while bro is taking home more reliable paychecks.  At this stage, I wouldn't take his word for things, get proof, look over the last couple years taxes, etc.  If his bro is married, maybe try and see what you can find out from your SIL...

I've seen it all.", "NTA, I don't suppose the employee on 2k a week is attractive and of the gender your husband prefers?", "That's not necessarily true, he has to employ people based on market forces, not how much money he is making.  If the person's skillset it worth 2000 a week, they have to pay him 2000 a week or they wont have an employee.", "INFO:\n\nDoes the person he\u2019s paying exist?\n\nDoes the person he\u2019s paying know that your husband is paying them that much or is that what your husband is saying he\u2019s paying?", "Yea, it\u2019s very common for business owners to forgo salaries while still paying employees. \n\nBut the reason OP is NTA and her husband is, is because it sounds like he\u2019s hiding a lot of stuff from her, and not discussing things with her when money is tight. And obviously the stealing.", "That's not really how it works. The business owner is building equity, the workers aren't, or not nearly as much. You stop paying your employees they will stop being your employees real fast.", "Yeah, I was quite surprised to learn the US used curb for both meanings of the word. We only use the curb spelling to mean stopping", "NTA\n\nMy money is in him being the employee and hiding the cash from you so he doesn\u2019t have to pay for much. \n\nBut that\u2019s the suspicious redditor coming out in me. \n\nStop supporting his lazy ass. You are paying for what you need to work \u2026with your own money. You have to work 3 jobs. You are being financially abused. Get a divorce lawyer.", "NTA but why are you even still married to this bum?", "NTA.. Op, so many things aren't right here", "I sense living above ones means but I also don't know the full picture. \n\nGuy violated trust though by essentially stealing.", "NTA. Financials are a marriage ending problem. Your husband has already proven he can\u2019t be trusted with money, good thing you have your own accounts now.", "NTA. I suspect there is something wrong with how he presents his accounting to you. Suggest to him to get a financial advisor to have a \u00b4look at the business to see where it can be improved. If his reaction is in any way suspicious, go and speak to a divorce attorney.", "NTA. \nI really can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s hiding money.", "OP is 29 in another AITA post and talking about their brother having his wedding the day before their 30th birthday in the coming summer. Here they're 48. \n\nI was totally on OPs side before this. Troll.", "Yeah I hate to jump to \u201cdivorce\u201d but unfortunately these kinds of stories are all too common. She\u2019s working her butt off to support them while he\u2019s chasing a pipe dream that he\u2019s either failing at or just mismanaging down the drain. \n\nNTA OP. At the very least, start building a separate fund that he has zero access to.", "Needed to see this. NTA. I started a software company years ago and intentionally took less money than I paid my software engineers. But that was because our goal was to build and sell the company and have me cash in. For a contracting services company? Nope. You gotta be making yourself billable to the client at a higher rate than that, or let your other person go and take the work on yourself. And any buyout would yield much less money as a multiple on the business. \n\nI also was single with no kids and never would have taken that risk in a different situation. Sounds like he likes the independence owning his own company affords, sadly without the business affording to provide for his family. \n\nIt takes guts to start your own thing. Sometimes the hardest part of that is having to call it quits. A sunk cost. My recommendation would be for you to help him not see this not as a failure, but as a learning experience. All while encouraging him to move on and provide for your family.", "It's a construction job so that pay does seem reasonable. The problem is the husband has no idea how to run a business and underbids the work so they don't make much profit and are in the red.", "Does that person write husband a check for $1,000 after they cash their paycheck \u201cto cover taxes\u201d or some other BS?", "From OP's PoV, she thinks he's hiding it (hence the word hide I guess).  It's quite possible that he's not hiding anything.  His first initial withdrawal from a joint account without discussion does not show a good precedent though.\n\nI'm with the others, due to the way it's set up, OP is financially tied (and thus an owner) in that business and should do some proper investigation into it.", "They are terrible at running a business. They should just go back to being employees at a construction because they can't handle running a business.", "Contractors have been making bank for most of the past 2 years.   Your husband needs a job and needs to be an ex", "NTA maybe he should work at his business himself and not have an employee.", "NTA I think there are bigger issues here then you think/know. Most start up business fail (& Bill Gates comes from a wealthy family..... since people love to use him as an example.) \n\nMy x-husband had the start up dream and he refused to see he was being used (the person starting it was a con man.) My x refused to face reality, preferring the dream. In your case I\u2019m not sure if it is an affair or dreamer refuses to face reality or lazy husband doesn\u2019t want to work or addiction or a combination of things.... but something stinks here!", "NTA \n\nand NOT trying to imply this is happening, but last time i saw a similar situation and it turns out the husband was paying his sugar baby as an employee", "Are you the asshole, OP?!?!\n\nAre you out of your goddamn mind?\n\nIs this \"employee\" actually a drug or gambling problem? Cos wtf.\n\nThe man is a literal black suckhole of a pit in your life.\n\nI am baffled that people stay in these horribly one sided relationships. Jesus.", "NTA Unless it's paying the bills consistently, it's a hobby, not a jobby. Dude needs to get a haircut and get a real job.", "Nta divorce him!!!", "Esh. You took 3 jobs for this loser?? Crazy.", "And blaming her for not bringing in enough. That's the real A H behaviour here", "NTA, both part of a couple should cover the exepenses. In an ideal world it would be 50/50 each one should also save some of their salary for the hard time and unexpected expenses.\n\nI understand your situation, i'm working my other half his not and i'm pushing him to have one because i won't continue to pull all the financial weight alone. You shlould not have to work 3 job to cover for the house while he work one that can not help you enough at best you should both have 2 job.\n3 job ... dang i don't even want to think all the time you spend working while he's not.", "NTA your husband is. You should put your foot down on his reimbursing you what he took and put your half into your account. I would struggle to trust him and anything he says after that because he made something that should\u2019ve been a easy conversation and you saying yes or no to if he could borrow your contribution to that account to his new business much worse by just stealing it and not attempting to pay it back but doubling down on checking you for your expenses even though you have 3 jobs and regularly contribute to the household. I think apart from the joint account you shouldn\u2019t have any shared accounts. I would ask that that joint account be altered so there\u2019s no overdraft or credit cards attached to it, I\u2019d close all those down on the account so you both can only spend what\u2019s been placed inside the account by you both. I say this because you can\u2019t trust him not to put you both in debt for his company or any other whim he has. You have to safeguard yourself and your financial health for the future.\n\nNothing wrong with requesting he gets a job, you have 3 and his company doesn\u2019t seem to be making enough that he can pay back what he stole or maintain his lifestyle.", "Might want to read that again. They were responding to someone else who is 29 and complaining about wedding day before his birthday.", "And make sure that account is in a *different financial institution.*\n\nIf the new separate account is in the same credit union/bank as the joint account, OP, and the joint account hits the negative, your sole account will then be drawn to cover the deficit.", "NTA, your husband is kind of a loser tbh", "Info: how much are you contributing?", "Divorce", "NTA\n\nThis all thing is so fishy tbh.", "OP is NTA but I\u2019ve definitely known business owners who paid employees properly before/when they couldn\u2019t afford to pay themselves. The problem here is OP\u2019s husband didn\u2019t set up any kind of plan, limit, or reasonable boundaries with his wife and just has a business that doesn\u2019t pay enough for him to contribute to the financial situation as he needs to, he took out their money without asking, and the business seems like it\u2019s not working out. He could also be hiding money or whatever, but there\u2019s nothing distinctly wrong with paying an appropriate salary to workers and taking the risk on yourself with a lower salary IF you set up financially to do it and don\u2019t impose it on your spouse/family. \n\nBUT I could definitely see a world where paying an employee market rate for their skills doesn\u2019t mean they can afford to collect more of a salary themselves, but husband needs to get a job because he took money without asking and his business is apparently unsuccessful and straining the family without agreement from OP.", "This is construction contracting, though.\n\nOP said he underbids jobs because he doesn't want to be underbid and not get the work, whether or not he can actually turn a profit at that price.", "Most new businesses fail because the founders won't bother to crunch a few spreadsheets to figure out their costs and how to set their rates/prices. You know, like OP's husband who loses money on construction jobs at a time when contractors have been making bank.", "If they're paying business taxes, they're making a profit. If they're making a profit, he can pay himself more than he is currently doing.", "When you do look first at miscellaneous expense and entertainment accounts.", "I have a small business and I'm appalled at how badly he's doing this. \n\nI'm also appalled he just took money out of your joint account to start the business. That would have me calling a forensic accountant and a divorce lawyer.\n\nIf he's serious about the business, he needs to learn to do things right--if you're in the USA, the Small Business Administration funds a ton of classes, mentorship, etc. for free because it's paid for by everyone's tax dollars. (After all, if the small businesses make more money, the IRS collects more taxes. If someone's not making a profit because they underbid all their jobs, they're not paying taxes.)", "Bad advice. OP says bills come out of the joint account - bills that are likely in both names. Important bills like mortgage payments where you lose your house if you don't pay. \n\nYou're telling them to tank their credit to spite their husband."]}
