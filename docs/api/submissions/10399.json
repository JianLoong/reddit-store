She just ran out of bandwidth, and I\u2019ve always been better at finding other support (my sister has BPD, so when you get down to it, my mom is really the only person she\u2019s ever had), so I got stuck sucking hind teat and she didn\u2019t realize.

Hopefully, you\u2019re going to be able to get out of it.\nIf you\u2019re parents stopped to \u2014- I can\u2019t go there. Where we\u2019re they when you were hurt??\nNever mind, I don\u2019t want to know.  \n\nNTA. Go NC", "That last bit. I\u2019m used to how hard my parents are on me and I\u2019ve accepted nothing I do will be good enough for them. Even before I was disabled I was never a good enough son for my dad. But I don\u2019t want to subject my fianc\u00e9e to that. They will criticize her by extension and not have compassion that she too is stressed and almost lost me. That we were building a life together and now none of that will be the same. I don\u2019t want them critiquing her. The accident happened two weeks ago, I have regular appointments everyday. Chiro everyday. Electric shock therapy every day. Hooking me up to electrodes every night before bed isn\u2019t fun. She just moved her stuff in this weekend. They will probably comment on her not \u201cdoing enough.\u201d My sister already made a comment about friends bringing us a meal train of food for the first week. How dare I let friends bring us lasagna \ud83d\ude44", "Honestly, if I were this son I would stop speaking to any of them without so much as an explanation. I am most definitely not a NC/LC person. But if my parents didn't care about my getting hit by a truck then I would cut them off, maybe forever.", "Your dad is a narcissist, I'm assuming your mum is an enabler, your sister is the golden child and you're the scapegoat. I'm not sure if you've read into this dynamic at all but you might find others who share your experiences over at r/raisedbynarcissists.\n\nYou'll be a lot happier once you cut them all off for good.", "NTA they couldn\u2019t be bothered to come see you after you had a major accident, but can use your house as a pitstop on their trip? Hell no.", "NTA! I hope you heal quickly from your accident.", "NTA my parents would move heaven and earth to come to me if I was hit by a truck. Recently when I was frustrated about house chores because I was sick my mom came over and helped me. \n\nI'm so sorry theyre like this. Focus on your community and say no", "Please remember this: you never, EVER have to share what you have with anyone you don\u2019t want to. There are no extenuating circumstances. If you don\u2019t want them in your house, that is your right.", "NTA. Why does your fiance have to cook for so many people? If someone told me they were disappointed in my home they wouldn't be welcomed back. Curious why your stay at home gf can't keep the house clean?", "Nta...you are recovering from an accident. You need help not guests", "NTA. You literally got hit by a truck. You don't have to do any heavy mental lifting during your recovery. Now is not a good time for a visit with your parents. Period. If they don't have the good manners to actually help you during your recovery, the least they can do is not make things worse for you.", "NTA, they sound invasive.", "NTA. Tell them you just aren't up to it and if they stop by anyway don't answer the door. I think it is presumptuous to expect a meal and there are plenty of places to use the bathroom.", "Wdym you're okay with them taking your sister and her family to Disney before they bother to visit you after you've been wheelchair bound (even if it's temp) ??!! And the only reason they're stopping by is for their convenience and they want YOU to serve them, cook and all that crap. Let me tell you what will be the least stressful thing to do, block all of them. NTA", "Yeah I wouldn't even do that. If the parents are this obnoxious, it's better not to see them while recovering. Hard enough to deal with healing without someone bitching and moaning at you about shit you are.", "I learned this from the JustNO subreddits (JustNo MIL, family, etc.) Get a Ring doorbell, or find some other way to record them. Because they will show up. And you don't want to open the door. But you want to record that they're out there.\n\nTell them if they don't leave, you'll call the police. NTA.", "Whoa! I would not give these people the time of day. They are AHs. It's your fault you got hit? WTF! I am glad my parents did not treat me that way when a guy passes cars stopped at a crosswalk and hit me. I am glad you are recovering. You don't need their stress."]}
