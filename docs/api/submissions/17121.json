I (m34) met my ex wife seven years ago, we dated for one year and were married for two before we divorced. When we met she already had two kids from her previous relationship, \"Patrick\" (m13) and \"Luna\" (f10). We have one son \"Tony\" (m5) together. \n\n My own relationship with her kids was good but they never treated me as their dad or something like that because their dad was involved in their life although my wife had primary custody, we all understood I was a step dad and were fine with it.\n\nMy relationship with my ex wife was good and I thought very loving, although after our divorce I realized that she used to talk a lot about her ex husband, comparing the two of us and stuff like that which is definitely weird but I didn't noticed it at the time. Well turns out that she really couldn't forget her ex and she ended up cheating with him. This was very hard to process when I found out thanks to one of her friends and our divorce was not easy. When her family found out about her infidelity they got very angry at her and went NC with her. All of this happened four years ago. Ever since her and her husband had two more babies together (3 and a few months old baby). \n\nHer husband got diagnosed with cancer around November last year. Even after everything they did to me I still feel sorry for them and their kids, it's a sad situation which makes me think I'm an ass. My ex and I have shared custody with our son but ever since her husband got sick my son has been staying with me more days as sometimes my ex's husband has to stay at the hospital and my ex has to help him. I'm okay with this of course \n\nHowever my ex asked me if I can start taking all of her kids home with me when I pick my son in these kind of emergencies. I told her that I don't want to do that and instead she should ask a friend to take care of them or try to pay a babysitter. I pay good child care* and I know they're not spending all that money on my son at the moment because he's mostly with me, I think it'll be enough to pay for a couple hours. She told me her friends don't want to help her anymore and her family still doesn't talk to her. I told them they need to figure out a solution, I will only help take care of my son. I feel like a POS to be honest, like I'm being too petty\n\n\n* I meant child support", "created_utc": 1683976088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13geniz/aita_for_not_babysitting_for_my_ex_when_her/", "score": 960, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole situation is unfortunate but it isn't your responsibility to help her. You're right about her being able to use the money you pay for child support to pay for care for her other kids. But even without that, it would still not be your responsibility. \n\nYou sound like a caring person and she knows how to make you feel guilty. But it's not wrong for you to refuse to help.", "Why should you feel like a P O S when you don't want to take care of 5 kids (aged 0 to 13) instead of just ONE? That's a big responsibility.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I won't blame you for not wanting to take care of that many kids. You're right, they should hire a nanny.", "NTA. These are her children with the man she cheated on you with. You're not responsible for them. You also don't owe the two of them any favours. Only your own son.", "NTA. And you aren\u2019t being petty. She is asking you to take care of 4 small kids who aren\u2019t your own, including an infant. Ridiculous. Petty would be getting child support reduced due to the current change in custody of your son. You are already supporting her family and are doing enough.", "NTA\n\nAnd if your integrate those kids into your life now, if the ex dies, she'll look to you to be the dad for all her kids", "NTA. You ex is. Cheated with her ex, ex gets sick and wants u to take care of her kids with ex. That it's complete disrespect to you. Take care of your kid. In fact, get full custody and tell her to kick rocks.", "NTA. They treated you like shit and fucked around behind your back and now they need help and they reach out to the person they trampled on? Their kids and her kids from a past relationship aren't your problem.", "NTA, if it was just the two older kids that you had an established relationship with, I might have a different opinion. But she really burned bridges. And unfortunately for her, now she has to deal with those consequences. Honestly, the fact that you have your son more time and aren\u2019t asking to modify child support is gracious compared to a lot of ex-spouses.", "NTA. You\u2019re taking responsibility for the child you share together, and as harsh as it sounds it\u2019s her own fault her family won\u2019t help her. I find it really hard to believe they don\u2019t have any new friends that can\u2019t help either.", "NTA\nI feel for your ex. I have four kids and my husband has cancer. His mom was the biggest help when he was in the hospital. It was seriously tough times. I needed a ton of support and was grateful for all those who helped me. \n\nBut, this is not your responsibility. Not your circus; not your monkeys! You take care of your son and let her worry about the others.", "Given the circumstances NTA \n\nYou\u2019d have to have celestial levels of compassion to do it and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to", "NTA\n\nShe wants you to take care of four kids that you have a very limited relationship with after she cheated on you. That's a lot of responsibility to expect someone to assume when she was the one who decided that she didn't want to be committed to you. This woman has some pretty serious issues with treating exs as if they were her current partner when it suits her.\n\nAnd her own family still not talking to her is a red flag. It sounds like she burned some bridges there.", "NTA\n\nI think it's a big ask for someone to take on 4 extra kids that aren't your own in emergency situation. It really depends on how many times she asks this, if it's only very few like once or twice, then maybe you could consider, but still a BIG ASK IMO.\n\nYour ex will most likely just have to stay with the kids herself, she is obviously wanting to be with her partner in these situations for emotional support at the hospital, but if he is at the hospital he is in good care, enough that if she can't be there it will be fine? Am I getting that right, or am I oblivious to something? \n\nThey need to figure this out themselves, you're only really responsible for your own son.", "NTA, because you are not obligated at all. It would be extraordinarily kind of you to help, particularly since those kids are probably scared about their dad\u2014but you are by no means an AH if you decide that\u2019s just not something you can do.", "NTA. While their situation is very sad and it would be incredibly kind of you, you certainly aren\u2019t under any obligation to do so. Asking anyone to watch 4 kids is a lot, especially with one so young.", "NTA - You get to decide what you do with your time. It\u2019s not selfish. they aren\u2019t your children (or even related to you). You are already helping a lot by picking up your child and ensuring that he\u2019s safe during emergencies.", "NTA. You are responsible for your son and your son only. Of course it's sad that her husband has cancer. Sounds like she's burned some bridges with all of her family and friends. Well, that's on her. It certainly shouldn't fall on you, her ex that she cheated on.", "NTA. you pay child support and mostly take care of your son, they can definitely hire a babysitter.", "NTA. \n\nAside from what everyone has said about this being an appropriate and understandable boundary under the circumstances, and a problem of her own making, there are a couple of other things that I think are relevant.\n\nFirst of all, it is important that you focus on your relationship with your son, and if you start looking after the other kids it may impact that. He is a step-child in the other household and he needs to know that he is the primary child to you. Also, having his own space at your house may help give him a sense of security and it could be problematic to disrupt that.\n\nSecond, you run huge risks if something happens to the kids while they are in your care. Your ex does not sound like a good person and with people like that there\u2019s always risks that someone will escalate a situation if something goes wrong. This could have a detrimental impact on you maintaining a relationship with your son in any number of ways, not to mention the problems for yourself dealing with it. \n\nYou are obviously someone with a great deal of kindness and compassion who is responding on a very human level to the situation. It\u2019s OK to put yourself and your son as a priority and it also seems to me that she knows exactly how to take advantage of your kind nature.", "NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s got a lot of nerve. You are responsible for your child only.", "She cheated on you, game\u2019s the game. Vehemently not the asshole, the fact that you think you might be the asshole shows you are a much better guy than I am", "NTA.  Have child support rescinded.  Take full custody.  Take care of your child and live your life", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut if your conscience tells you to help, just do that.", "NTA.", "NTA. What about his family? I understand she isn't speaking to hers, but maybe his relatives can help? I don't see why you should be the de facto alternative.", "NTA. She had no problem picking another man over her husband in the past, now she can pick her numerous kids over her husband if she has to \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Sucks for her, but the consequences of our shitty actions do indeed smart sometimes. You shouldn't feel guilty in the least. *Not your circus, not your monkey, my friend.*", "NTA\n\nYou are responsible for your child not for your former step children or her subsequent children. \n\nThe situation is sad but it is not your responsibility.", "NTA she is delusional and entitled, as in she feels entitled to your time and free childcare. Don't feel bad about saying no. Not your circus.", "NTA. Your son is your responsibility, the rest of her brood is hers. She's got a lot of nerve even asking, given that the whole reason she's in this situation is because she cheated on you.", "NTA at all. You don\u2019t have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nYou know that this is something that you don\u2019t want to do. Say no without guilt.", "There is a way you can help: if the inlaws won't deal with her because of the cheating (and only that) talk to her inlaws and say there are 4 kids that need their help. They can think what they want about your ex, but tell them, in no uncertain terms, that you can't help the four kids. The two older only sometomes, but that is it.\n\nThat will do your ex a solid. It will free you from guilt, and it will allow you to take your son and the two older sometimes, which it sounds.like you want to do.\n\nNo, you should not have to do this. But doing right by the kids (by getting the inlaws to help) is an awesome move.", "If it was a short-term emergency (i.e the husband collapsed and has to be rushed to the hospital and she had no time to find anyone else) then you would be. But sounds like she wants you to be the go-to babysitter. She can\u2019t ask that of you. If it was just the two older kids *maybe* since you know them and they aren\u2019t as much work due to their age. But she also wants you to take the two younger ones. You are NTA.\n\nI do think her family is though. Yes she cheated and that is horrible, but she is still their daughter and her kids their grandchildren. I can\u2019t fathom how they could just throw them all away. You don\u2019t have to cut people out of your life to let them know you are disappointed in their actions.", "YTA", "NTA. You are allowed to set boundaries and not babysit her other children (of course, you do have the duty to take care of your own child when she is unavailable, which you are doing). And it's also okay to prioritize your own needs.\n\nHowever, I do feel like in this situation her world seems to be crumbling down on her. Most of us have needed help in situations when we maybe didn't deserve it. I think part of being human is also helping others in need, even when they have done us harm before or when it is not exactly our responsibility. In this case, I would show more compassion (without letting her exploit that). You said you could totally help, you just don't want to. And this is why I think it would be great if you helped a little. Maybe not with taking care of all other children all the time, since that actually is a lot. But it is possible to help while also setting boundaries and taking care of yourself. For example, you could offer help in specific ways, like when you go with your child to the park anyways, ask if any of the other kids want to come, too. You would then go with them to the park only and that's it. Or run an errand that's difficult to do for her in this situation. I don't know. If you decide to do that, you have to make it clear that you are not able to provide ongoing childcare, and that they should get a nanny for that (maybe offer to help her find a babysitter? She might be overwhelmed with everything right now).\n\nBut even if you decide not to help, I don't think it makes you an A. You have the right to decide how much involvement you have in their lives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Asking you to take over as primary caregiver for an additional four children is actually a pretty AH  move, although I understand your ex is looking for help anywhere she can find it. I honestly don't care what her family thinks about her behavior. For them to leave their grandchildren and / or nibblings so completely without assistance when their father is in such serious condition is a major, major AH move.

There is no need for you to feel guilty. She is not your friend nor is she your family. She is simply the woman who cheated on you while you were married. You have no obiligation to help her or her current husband. Your only obilagtion is to be a good father to your son.

Don\u2019t let her take advantage of you op. She laid the path without thought to the consequences. Sometimes you have to let people live the lives they make for themselves. To do that is not malicious or selfish. Someone needs to see her consequences so that they don\u2019t follow her path.

You don't owe your ex or her affair partner anything, and you only owe common human respect to those older kids you had a very basic relationship with. They and the other kids are entirely their AH parents' responsibility. I feel sorry for them too, but you should absolutely not become the childcare for them.\n\nTechnically, you're being generous still paying child support based on a shared agreement that isn't true anymore, as you also take care of your kid.", "agree, NTA, and it sounds like the ex has a habit of abusing people who help her until they can\u2019t give anything more and they go NC.
