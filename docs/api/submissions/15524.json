I'm not exactly sure what his condition is, but he clearly has some sort of developmental disorder and has the mind of a 5-year-old despite being almost 12. My son wanted to invite him to the sleepover, but I was hesitant since I wasn't sure if I was equipped to handle someone with special needs. Plus, Jason has a caretaker at school that is always with him, so I know he requires a lot of attention and supervision.\n\nI initially told my son that he couldn't invite Jason over because of his special needs, but he got upset and said that he didn't want Jason to be left out since he's his first and only friend. I still told him no because I didn't think I could care for Jason properly, and I didn't think it was appropriate for my son to have to take on that responsibility either.\n\nAt this point, my son was having a bad attitude, so I decided to cancel the sleepover altogether. When I told my wife about the situation, she called me an ableist for not wanting Jason to come over just because he has a disability. She said that we should have called his mother to find out how we could accommodate him and make him feel included in the sleepover. \n\nWas I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1682280933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wokyx/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_invite_his_special/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or that he could come for dinner and cake, but would need to come home before bedtime. Or that he could participate, but would need a parent with him (which would have given you an extra adult to help out, which might not be a bad thing).\n\nMy perspective is that I have a nephew who is physically disabled. And my brother and SIL were so grateful for the parents who did not automatically exclude him from birthday parties, but who checked with them to find out what he could do, what places around town were accessible to him. There was great rejoicing by all the year Nephew figured out how to maneuver a laser tag gun and his wheelchair at the same time, opening up another option besides bowling and going to the movies for the birthday parties.\n\nBut the key thing was that the kids put up with the movies and bowling because, like your son, they wanted to include my nephew.", "YTA \n\nNot for being concerned about your ability to manage the situation but because you didn\u2019t even try to find solutions.\n\nMaybe a call to Jason\u2019s parents to see if there were any accommodations or how sleepovers have been approached in the past, or inviting him for part of it but not the actual sleepover portion.\n\nIt sounds like your kid really likes him and cares about him feeling excluded, you could learn a lesson from your son.", "YTA A simple phone calls to the child's parents would have clarified If their son would be able to attend the sleepover.

Your son could really have learned something about another level of friendship versus face value of who can walk and talk like him.

I adore people in his life who simply make the effort to communicate. If we aren't able to be involved or it's for another reason, i.e. differing personalities, I have no qualms.

It's unbelievable how little OP cares about doing the right thing, and I can't imagine someone failing to put the most basic amount of effort into doing the right thing for their kid and their kid's friend.", "YTA, you could have easily reached out to the child\u2019s parents to find out if that would even be feasible for him and if so, what would you need to know and look out for. You could have also worked out with them for him to come for a portion of the party and then go home if they didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate for him to stay the night.

I hope he continues on that path, the word needs more people like him.", ".....You DON'T even know what the disability is but are automatically saving you can't accommodate it at all....\n\nOf course YTA and an incredibly albiest one at that, clearly your son has gained every ounce of his compassionate personality from his Mother.", "You're abelist as hell and YTA", "YTA. Holy smokes, dude. Nuke the whole party instead of making a phone call? Rash and selfish. Glad your wife has a good head on her shoulders.", "Your wife had it literally spot on.

I wouldn't want to assume that responsibly or liability. With that being said I also think that sleepovers are problematic in general for that very reason. I do think you could handle yourself with a little more tact in regards to someone with special needs, but I'm not very tactful either so I get it.", "YTA, but honestly I would talk to the parent and I would probably try to set up a sleepover with only this kid to see how it goes.  Groups of kids at a sleepover can be very cruel.", "You are blatantly discriminating against a 12yo with disability and assuming he's \"too much\" without even knowing what his disability actually is and you still need to ask if you are the AH? Just in case it wasn't clear enough, YTA. A huge one.", "YTA. I support students with special needs.

Assuming that he would be too much without having any information was super ableist.", "That in an of itself was an asshole move.

This guy has no idea what the child needs and just assumed it would be too much. If he called the parents and found out that it would indeed be too much fine, but he didn\u2019t even bother to ask", "They could very well be learning needs that aren\u2019t needed during a sleepover. Not to mention if his needs are extensive it\u2019s likely his parents would have declined the invite or tried to bring him for some of it but not the sleepover, which would have still made OP\u2019s son and his friend very happy. And if nothing else, cancelling the whole sleepover because his son was upset at his ableist Dad definitely makes OP the AH."]}
