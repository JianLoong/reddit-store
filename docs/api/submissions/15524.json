And your son seems pretty damn awesome based on his actions, so I assume you teach him good stuff. \n\nBut you need to admit you were wrong, tell him why you did what you did and how you excluded this other kid without even knowing any details.

Great message, dad. Hopefully he isn't in charge of your Elder care and remembering this moment. And, yup...YTA.", "Wow! YTA. And your son is a very good child, thinking about his friend and wanting to include him instead of thinking, \"He has a disability, better not invite him then.\" \n\nI know in the past the world would think like that, but we have evolved much ever since then. Thank God!", "Hosting other peole's children overnight can be a bit of a clusterfuck, particularly when you're getting more than one from different families and everyone has a bit of a different home life. Food allergies in particular scare the crap out of me. A special needs guest can present additional challenges, and depending on the extent of their disability can be very daunting.\n\nThat said, kids in those positions deserve as many of the same chances as any other kid. At the very least, I think a conversation with a parent is in order. If that child requires considerably more attention than you're comfortable accepting responsibility for, that's absolutely within the realm of a parental judgement call.\n\nBut a LOT of disabilities are very deceiving. Someone may not talk the way you're used to hearing, or have trouble walking, or be less aware of traditional social cues, etc., but are otherwise fairly independent. Moreover, parents of special-needs kids, in my experience, are pretty inclined to help out. My daughter has a friend that requires extra attention, and when I consulted her father about her disability, he actually came over with her. The girls(who all wanted to make their friend part of the group) watched movies and played board games and gossiped and all the typical sleepover stuff, and her dad and I drank a few beers on the deck and got to know one another, and he slept in our guest room.\n\nI think you were in the wrong to make a unilateral decision and not consult with your wife, at the very least. A phone call to Jason's parents would have been in order as well. I think you jumped the gun.\n\nYTA.", "YTA... a call to the mother to discuss the needs should have been done first, then you could decide if that was an appropriate setting for a first sleep over with that friend.

But I'm not gonna give you an ass whoopin like everyone else is. Cuz I don't think you're an asshole, I just think you were being careful. My stepson has some stuff. Autism, ADHD, and we're pretty sure he has ODD although that's undiagnosed. When I first met my wife going into things, I thought the exact same way, I didn't want to take care of him by myself at first not because I was trying to judge him, but because I had literally zero idea of anything. I was brand new in the world of neurodivergent children, I had no idea about anything. And I think that's where you were coming from unless I'm wrong. You don't know how to care for the child, like you said he has a supervisor with him all day throughout school.\n\nIt's okay to be ignorant of these things especially when most people don't really have a lot of experience in them. I would say the vast majority of people don't have experience dealing with a neurodivergent child, just facts. Especially because the range can be so wide: they can appear to be neurotypical and everything seems fine and you wouldn't even be able to tell they have any disabilities unless under very certain circumstances, or they can be nonverbal and prone to a meltdown every 5 seconds. The range is so wide.\n\nYour wife definitely handled it better, like she said you could have called the mom and asked if there was anything you needed to know or if she was comfortable with this herself instead of just shutting it down. But it can be a learning experience for you.\n\nI really don't think you're an asshole, I don't think that in the slightest. Just saying you were wrong in this particular circumstance.

Either way, you would have had the information and then make an informed decision, rather than just an ablist one simply because the boy has special needs. \r  \n\r  \nThe problem here is, is that you didn't look beyond his special needs, you never asked anyone for information and just said \"no\". And then you decide to cancel everything all together because your son shows love and compassion to a friend...a special needs friend, who most likely will be excluded from things his entire life because people don't take the time to understand him and his needs. That is sad. \r  \n\r  \nGo to the parents of the boy and talk to them. By all means, voice your concerns about his needs and decide, purely based on those facts, if you feel comfortable about inviting him on the sleepover.

Let's say the parents think a sleepover might be too much for him, let him come over for a few hours, spend time with his friends and let the parents pick him up later in the evening. But TALK to the PARENTS! And give your son his sleepover back. Be compassionate and please re-evaluate yourself if this is how you, conciously or subconciously, think of or treat people with special needs (regardless of what those needs are) and never judge anyone by a snap shot moment (e.g. in this case the boy needing a caretaker at school).", "I have a special needs child.

But Ashley, because of her disability, hadn\u2019t been invited to ANY, and she was like 7 or 8 at the time!! It didn\u2019t make sense to me. She was my friend, and I didn\u2019t see anything different with her. I thought her wheelchair was cool!! But apparently, no one else had thought they could accommodate her.\n\nAshley actually got around fairly well without her wheelchair by kind of drag-hopping herself wherever she needed to go. My parents carried her when they had to, but for the most part, she managed perfectly fine on our carpet and on our back lawn! She barely needed any help at all!
