I\u2019m assuming the play area isn\u2019t coated in toxic goo.  Well, no more so than any other surface toddlers touch.\n\nThey can\u2019t be changing every kid after playtime, surely that would take forever?  I am confused.\n\nIs there anything that tends to be different about his initial clothes versus spares?  Brighter \u201cstereotypically boy inappropriate\u201d colors, harder to remove for diaper changing, some cartoon characters?", "NTA that is very strange. Bring it up with who ever is in charge of the daycare center.", "NTA. I'd be a little alarmed by this new aide making a habit of having children disrobe unnecessarily.", "NTA - setting aside the weirdness of it all, it's your child so you should have final say.

That\u2019s weird from them.", "YWNBTA.\n\n1: Constantly doing extra laundry is expensive and wasteful. You should not have to do that.\n\n2: Surely they cant do that daily, for every kid? That would take hours daily I imagine.\n\n3: Like others said: It is weird that someone is changing his/everyones clothes daily and insisting on that. Why would they do that?", "NTA \nI'd definitely ask why/what's going on .. \nI had/have a similar thing happening.\nMy son's in the middle of transitioning from young toddler(1-2s) to older toddler (2-3s) at 1.5 years \n.. So he isn't potty trained quite yet,  but he does make a mess of himself eating and sometimes he gets a laugh on spitting his water out onto himself.. or finds a way to get his hands past the net on the fencing to play in the dirt out side .. etc.. \nThey change him every... Single... Day... In the young toddlers room.\nDays he is in with the older kids, nope. \nHe comes home shirt a mess, yogurt on his pants.. whatever. \n\nI asked why he was being changed daily constantly and they always said something like \"this age is just a mess\" \"toddler play hard\".. etc, with nothing wrong with the clothes.. sometimes his shirt or pants were slightly wet with no smell but mostly not a dang thing! \n\nEventually I found out from a parent with a couple kids there his teacher in YT ultimately just doesn't like seeing any sort of mess on the kids, at ALL. Like the slightest bit of water even and she'd change the kids. \nShe feels it's uncomfortable for them... And it isn't a hill I felt like dying on.   \n\nTo me, it's all day care clothes, Idgaf about them and he's a small toddler/old baby.. he's going to be a mess. \nAs long as it's not a diaper leak, or massive amounts of food or drink, whatever.. why bother, right? but it's her class, she means well by it, and my son absolutely adores her so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f .. the laundry bit sucks for sure.. I hear ya. \n\nAlllll that said... If nothing is actually happening but being outside, that's weird.. and concerning. \n\nIs there a camera access you could see what's going on? \nDefinitely find another teacher/administrator you could chat with.", "NTA I don\u2019t mean to be that person, but I honestly worry about some kind of abuse/taking advantage of your son. Go to someone higher up in the daycare", "NTA.\n\nThe waste with all that extra laundry... I'm stressed FOR you having to do extra work now. I'm sorry that the caregiver isn't thinking about that for you.", "NTA\nIt's pretty excessive to change him like that and so much extra washing for you. You should see the mess my girl comes home in without being changed lol", "NTA but are you positive the clothes aren't getting wet?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
