I'm picturing grown men standing around a bonfire in diapers drinking beer.", "Info: what in gods green gracious earth and every heaven and hell there is, is a fucking diaper party.", "...the hell is a diaper party?", "Let me put this plainly - nobody cares if you want to go or not, this is about whether or not you want to be supportive to your brother, that is it. You are confusing your annoyance at a situation as the thing of utmost importance when it is not. Of course it\u2019s stupid! You still go IF you want to be there for your brother. He asked. I\u2019d just go and roll my eyes on the inside and then be done with it.", "INFO if you were celebrating something in your life, would you invite your brother?", "This is essentially a baby shower for your brother.  It is a party to celebrate him.\n\nIt is not an event for you to make friends or socialize necessarily.  He invited you because you are family and important to him.  This isn't about you.\n\nShow up.  Take some diapers.  Stay for an hour and move on.  Skipping it isn't worth damaging your relationship with your family.\n\nNTA for not wanting to go but YTA if you don't.", "NTA.  First of all, what in the hell is a diaper party?  Yes, just by him some diapers and stay home.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but I know my partner would have been really hurt and bummed if his brothers didn\u2019t join him for golf while I had my baby shower (we didn\u2019t do a diaper party they just went to golf instead). My sister didn\u2019t attend my baby shower and I was completely crushed. I totally understand why you don\u2019t want to go, I hate being at parties like that, but it seems like it was really important to him that you be there. Having a kid is a big transition in your life and he probably just wanted you there for support and because you\u2019re family. If you don\u2019t have a good relationship that\u2019s different I suppose but I can understand too why he would be hurt. Sometimes you have to push your own comfort aside to show up for people who are important to you when they ask. So soft YTA", "NTA\n\nBut, tell him why you feel like you don't want to go.", "This is something that means something to your brother, and he obviously wants you there so and going against the grain with a very soft YTA. However I can see it wouldn't be fun for you - could you ask if you could invite a couple of your friends? Or find a compromise, so go for a bit, make an appearance, and then go do your own thing.", "Yta, not so much for not going as for making this about you. you go to support your brother. You can host a party with your friends and invite him when its about you.", "You're NTA. You shouldn't be expected to go to a gathering where you're not comfortable. I would not expect my brother to attend a party where all the other attendees are my friends with no real connection to him. You already took a high road by offering to buy him the diapers anyway, that should have been more than enough.", "NTA", "YTA, assuming no other extenuating circumstances. This is an event to celebrate a milestone for your brother, not a random trip or party full of people that you clearly don't mesh with. You don't have to stay for the whole thing, just make a damn appearance and move on after an appropriate amount of time. \n\nAbout the non-milestone events, it sounds like your brother has been trying to get closer to you for years, but from what you've written you seem indifferent about him at best. No one is forcing you to return his sentiment, and regardless of your past history with him, it's okay if you don't want that kind of relationship. You don't like the fact that he assumes you didn't have fun at a given event and doesn't invite you to the next one, yet you're saying here that you did not in fact have fun, so clearly he picked up on that.\n\nAnyway, go to the diaper party because it's not about you. For future events, tell him what your issue is, don't expect him to read your mind.", "info: WTF is a Diaper party.  \n\n\nNTA either way thou cause you can just go do your own thing", "NTA.\n\nI suggest you tell him the reasons, not us.", "NTA. I'd skip it. It sounds like no matter what you do, your brother is mad at you. You don't go, he's mad, you go and you didn't engage enough or have enough fun.\n\nAt this point, how many parties are necessary because someone is pregnant?", "NTA\n\nIf this were not your brother, but were another man you knew, would you feel obligated to go?  \n\nIf the answer is \"No\" that is your proper answer here as well.  You are right.  These are your brother's friends, not yours.  \n\nWhile it's great your brother wants to include you, clearly none of his friends do.  \n\nSo I'd say don't go on trips or to parties with his friends.  If he wants to spend time with you, just you and he can go somewhere such as a fishing trip.  And you're not an AH for not wanting to go.  If anything, he's an AH for insisting you go.", "NTA.  You don't have to go anywhere you don't want to.  You also do not have to give an explanation other than \"sorry, I have plans for that day.\"", "NTA! You do not want to go. That should be the end of it.", "So, your brother has a littles fetish and invited you to hang out with his little friends in diapers? This is so fucking weird.  NTA", "Edit: NTA. Is this like a tupperware/go fund me party? Is he celebrating having a child he can't afford to care for?", "NTA. Why does your brother want you to attend a party where no one will talk to you and you would just sit there bored and miserable? Also, a diaper party is one of the dumbest things ever.", "AYTA for not wanting to go? Of course not, to each their own feelings. But if you don't go, YWBTA. I'm introverted as hell, but when my friends invite me to their loud AF, giant birthday parties with half the neighborhood, I go and pretend to enjoy it. Same thing here : it's not about buying diapers for your brother, it's about being there at an event that obviously means something to him.\n\nBuy diapers and beers, pretend to enjoy the party and leave after two hours.", "Can\u2019t you just go for a bit?

Like a baby shower, it's not about not being able to afford your baby, but simply a celebration of new life with your friends and family.

I thought it was like college toga parties, but with diapers. XD\n\nAnyway, I'm going with NAH. You've clearly tried to go to events with your brother before, and it just didn't work out. But it's very sweet of him to keep offering to include you in things. Neither of you are in the wrong.", "It's not like a research mission for something that you might wanna do one day though, it's a celebration for a milestone in your brother's life. As an introvert myself I sympathise with you not feeling at ease there - but showing up for him (even just for half an hour) is more important than avoiding social discomfort.

I didn't have one when my kid was born, didn't really see the need. If I want an excuse to hang out with friends, I can just invite them over for a BBQ or something.

If you're an island, sure, but you know the saying. Sometimes, you look past yourself and suck it up bc the person you love wants it.

That's the non-judgemental way to think about it.", "A lot of times when friends have the financial means to do so, they wish so support their friends during milestones like having a kid by contributing gifts.", "Jeeez dude. You feel that about birthday presents? I would ask if you were a Jehovah\u2019s witness, but they\u2019d probably be all over giving people baby supplies.", "You're a massive dick, and I hope nobody ever gifts you anything ever again lmao. I also sincerely hope your child learns nothing from you, because you're an atrocious example of humanity.", "Coming together to celebrate, I am all for that. Support - I'd love to see it in a more meaningful way is all. Like not having the expectation that every piece of clothing an infant wears for a month or two before they outgrow it has to be bought new off a registry to be a gift, or that baby furniture has to be new. I wish our culture embraced support more in terms of hand me downs (without it feeling like a shameful thing that can't be a gift), or coupons for watching a baby so parents get an occasional break, or offering to care for the pets when the mom goes into labor. Spending money on Things isn't always the real sort of support new parents need.", "A few years before he died, my father asked us in the family if we could all just stop with the birthday and christmas gifts, he was done with the mindless and wasteful consumerism of buying shit because of a day on a calendar. If he wanted something, he was in a place financially where he just got it for himself. What meant more to him was acts of service when I visited - things they were too old to do, like swimming down to clean the pool drain, or hauling things outside to pressure wash. \n\nAnd now my husband and I stopped exchanging gifts, for the same reason. Don't buy me dumb shit because the calendar says a certain date.  But I love the local buynothing group, they had my back when I needed crutches for a month - but didn't need to buy a pair just to have it sit in my garage for the next decade. And it makes my day, in return, when some random person on the other side of town, who I've never met, needs a recliner, or a wheelchair, and I've got an extra I can deliver to them. It keeps shit out of landfills, it fills a real need when people need it. \n\nIt's not about never doing acts of kindness, or giving things. It's about not confusing those with mindless consumerism.", "You\u2019re the consumerism equivalent of a vegan here. You\u2019re very sure you\u2019re morally superior, and just as insufferable."]}
