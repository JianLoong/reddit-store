Kayla and I don\u2019t really get along due to a massive difference in opinions, but we\u2019ve always been civil. About a month ago, I invited one of our neighbours over because he got locked out and it would be 30 minutes to an hour for the housing association to come unlock the door and it was raining. Long story short, he was a total ass and the police had to get involved. Whilst he was over, he took Kayla\u2019s wine and began to drink it out the bottle. I told him to stop, but he didn\u2019t care and finished the whole bottle. But, if I\u2019m being honest, the wine was the least of my concerns at that point in time.\n\nThe next morning, after spending hours at the police station, I text Kayla apologising about the wine and said I\u2019d replace it asap. Then she dropped the bombshell that it was a \u00a3200 bottle that she got in Italy. I said there\u2019s no way I could afford that but that I\u2019d get her a nice bottle anyways. She insisted I send her the money so she could get a new bottle. I said no. I was apologising profusely and explained that I wasn\u2019t trying to be an ass, but it wasn\u2019t my fault. She knows what went down between me and neighbour as she had to make a statement.\n\nA few days later, I came back to the house and found her standing in the kitchen. I tried to be nice but she just kept saying \u2018send me the money\u2019 over and over. We got into an argument and she said \u2018if you couldn\u2019t afford to replace it, why drink it?\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t drink it, our creepy neighbour did.\n\nI had to go to the pharmacy and whilst I was in there, I see her come in. I was still upset by the recent argument, but I tried to be nice. As me and my friend were leaving, she says \u2018so you can afford those pills but not pay me back?\u2019 I said yeh because she doesn\u2019t need wine to survive.\n\nI felt like I was living in crazy world and she became so mean and cruel to me. I ended up filing an official complaint with the house association because I felt so unsafe around her and they said they\u2019d some sort of investigation. Well, they ended up terminating her lease.\n\nI got back from a lecture and saw all her boxes in the hallway. Kayla looks at me and says \u2018are you proud of yourself? All I wanted was for you to reimburse me for the wine and you get me kicked out? I hope you\u2019re happy, you prick.\u2019\n\nAITA for getting her lease terminated?\n\nEDIT: Guys, the neighbour wasn't a stranger. He's been over to our place many times before. He was friends with all my housemates (including Kayla). He never showed any red or even orange flags up until this point. I know that could be naive to say, but he was cool with everyone in our house. I'm referring to him as 'the neighbour' because I want to distance myself from him because of this event. I'm sorry if I led people to believe he was a total stranger.\n\nThank you u/Nessa-E for helping me find the [wine](https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/zugober+belezos+50+doca+rioja+spain/1/uk) in question.

I am middle-aged, earn well and occasionally enjoy a fine beverage. While there absolutely are excellent $200+ Italian wines out there, it is inconceivable to me that such a bottle will be kept in a fridge shared with roommates. Without proof of the wine's price, and given the roomate's erratic behavior,  I am inclined to think that she lied about the price of the bottle and tried to extort you for money while you are in a vulnerable and traumatized state. \n\nDoes your roomate have renters insurance? In the US, it is a good idea to have renters insurance if one has valuable possessions. A $200+ bottle of wine qualifies and insurance would cover it.", "NTA based on your replies. Holy s#\u00a1+! You were SA'd, she tries to make you drop 200 you don't have immediately, and turns out the wine was only worth 9????? You didn't ask for her to get evicted, and since she got *evicted* I'm getting the feeling it's probably over more than just her harassment of you about the wine. Plus she tried to steal the money from you and shamed you for picking up meds???? Hell no. NTAAAAA.\nETA: Even without the SA, OP was still clearly also a victim here. If you said Y T A on here at any point evaluate why you think someone is automatically responsible for whatever someone they invited in does. Why do you only see how bad that concept is once violence is involved??? It's frankly disgusting how quickly people were ready to say OP was T A for something OP had no real way of knowing would happen (neighbor was not a stranger and had previously had a good rapport with the whole house) and genuinely tried to stop. Under **no circumstances** is OP responsible for someone else's criminal behavior that OP did not approve of and actively tried to stop.", "NTA. You were dealing with being SA, and said flat out you couldn't afford the money in one go. She also lied about the cost of the wine. Good riddance and I wish you healing and peace", "NTA. OP doesn't come out and say it, but I'm going to spell it out for people who don't seem to be getting it (and OP, obviously correct me if I'm wrong) - it sounds like OP was likely sexually assaulted by this neighbor during the time he was in their home (police involvement + OP mentions needing to go to the hospital in a comment + follow-up trip to the pharmacy). AND Kayla was aware of this: She needed to make a statement to the police.\n\nKayla's response? To hold her roommate responsible with this level of harassment for her sexual assaulter drinking one (1) bottle of wine (from one of OP's comments):\n\n>Because she would follow me around the house yelling 'give me my money' over and over.

I got \u00a330 from babysitting and she tried to take the cash out my wallet.  \nIn the complaint I mentioned that she was making the other housemates uncomfortable and that she would yell at me whenever I entered a room she was also in.\n\nI also think people are missing the fact that OP didn't ask for Kayla to be evicted, OP only made a complaint about how she was being treated. It was the housing association's decision to evict her and there must have been good reason for them to make such a drastic decision and open themselves up to such legal liability.", "I cannot imagine how terrible a person Kayla has to be to find out that her roommate was sexually assaulted, and her only concern was getting reimbursed for the wine the perpetrator drank. NTA, and take care of yourself.", "NTA.  There is a whole lot of victim blaming in these comments.  I hope no one says the things y\u2019all have been saying to OP if something bad ever happens to you.", "INFO: did she provide any proof the wine cost \u00a3200 or research it to check? If you are not getting along, I\u2019m just curious if it really was worth \u00a3200.

People don\u2019t get thrown out for just asking for money back. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t worth \u00a3200, she was pulling a fast one and hoped intimidating you would make you pay. She deserves to go.", "Based on your comments, it appears your roommate knew the neighbor. The neighbor stole from her, and she should have collected from him. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to expect to be reimbursed $200 for a bottle of wine without some evidence. It\u2019s not hard to take a picture of the label and find the price online. Further, a $200 bottle shouldn\u2019t be stirred in a fridge. If it\u2019s quality was impacted by improper storage, it becomes worthless. Similarly, if the bottle was already open, partially consumed, and then refrigerated, the remainder is worthless. I seriously question whether the roommate\u2019s bottle was worth its original price when the incident occurred.  Think of it as depreciation. \n\nFinally, anyone who pursues an assault victim to reimburse them for collateral damage, is simply soulless and deserves your contempt. \n\nNTA", "Reading through these comments, OP you are absolutely NTA. It's horrifying how some of these commenters are rattling on about responsibility after what you went through even though you offered to compensate Kayla as best as you could (which you weren't obligated to do either!). It wasn't your fault for trying to be nice to a neighbor you were familiar with. Kayla, however, is a real piece of work for trying to bully you into repaying her almost 20x the price for something that your *attacker* damaged *while attacking you*. To echo what some other people have said: your friend/roommate wouldn't have suggested reporting Kayla unless they  knew she was in the wrong, and the association wouldn't have terminated the lease unless they also knew she was in the wrong.

Sending you love and peace.", "I feel like more must have been going on if they immediately terminated her lease as a result of the investigation. If there's no way to get the money back from the neighbour I'd say it would've been fair to suggest to pay her back half, when you can afford to do so. That aside, it sounds like she was not being very willing to compromize in any way. If she really made you feel unsafe then NTA for bringing this up with the house association. I doubt they would terminate her lease over a single complaint so it isn't your fault that her lease was terminated. Could it have been resolved better with compromise/communication, maybe, but that's not just on you.", "NTAH - Roommate is the AH - If the wine really was 200 then she should have had it stored safely away. Demanding repayment from someone who can't afford it is going to get anyone anywhere. The neighbor is the one who owes the new bottle and for the disturbed peace. The roommate should have gone after him, but instead, choose the softer target. Neighbor is the AH and should be treated as a massive AH. OP is the AH for allowing things to escalate. Additionally, harassing the OP in public about normal living expenses versus a luxury that someone else should be paying for, should IMO be reason enough to void a lease.", "Anyone commenting Y T A when the circumstances have been explained about what happened to you and then what your housemate did following the assault etc needs to really reassess themselves.

Seeing as though the police had to get involved and statements needed to be taken down, something big happened and sounded like it could have been a bit traumatic. \n\nBack in university all of my roommates would have done the same thing and invited our neighbour over if they were locked out and in the rain, even if we didn't  know them. You would not expect most people to fly off the handle and require police to come. \n\nIf I was the roommate I'd be more concerned that you were ok instead of worrying about the bottle of wine.

And going off your language, I'm making an assumption that puts the neighbour in an even worse light. It's not like you cracked open the bottle for funsies.\n\nYou offered to buy her more wine, just not the \u00a3200 Italian bottle. \n\nAlso, I doubt your housing association terminated her lease based on this one situation alone. I've been with renting places and it's hard to get someone evicted like that unless it's really bad (from my own experience) so I feel like this was the final straw.", "EDIT - Yikes, editing initial response to say NTA based on the OPs responses to mine.\n\n~~YTA~~ (unless further information shows otherwise).  Talk about a disproportionate response!  She asks for her money back and you make a complaint about it?  How did her making that request make you feel unsafe?  How would you have felt if she had made a complaint about you and you had to leave?  Why did you think that was OK?\n\nWe actually need more details about the official complaint, and some explanation of the whole \"didn't feel safe\" bit.
