If I\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t even know all of my brothers ages. We are also low income and it SUCKS.

We don\u2019t get to spend a lot of money on nice things. \n\nBut you know what, I wouldn\u2019t complain if my mum didn\u2019t make us feel like a burden for the living situation she\u2019s brought us into. \n\nMy mum takes it out on us when she gets stressed by money. As in she shouts at us when we run out of electricity saying all we (me and my brothers) do is waste money on games and food. Because of this I feel guilty buying clothes or asking for school lunch money and it\u2019s made me resentful.\n\nMy mum had an argument with my dad and it was pretty bad. \nMy dad was gone for WEEKS. Me and my brothers would hear my mum crying on the phone to our auntie. This might be selfish but that was literally the best time for us. My mum is usually strict but back then, she didn\u2019t care what we did. We could buy whatever food we wanted, go out with friends, she never shouted at us.\n\nPlus my dad is a massive bum. He doesn\u2019t work or help out with money or spend time with us (not that i want him to) I personally thought he was deadweight so I didn\u2019t miss his presence. \n\nSo when my mum told me that she was pregnant with a girl when my dad came back I was less than happy. I was PISSED and I shouted at her why would you do that?? How can we afford that? Where will we get the space, the flat is tiny!\n\nThis upset my mum and she shouted at me but she also explained later that having children is a blessing and that I should be happy I finally have a little sister. She said it\u2019s not my place to worry about money and that my dad does his bit, which I find it hard to believe. I just think it was irresponsible and reckless on her part. I\u2019m also mad she\u2019s still with my pathetic excuse of a dad but I haven\u2019t told her that.\n\nAm I wrong to be angry at my mum being pregnant? Is it bad I wished she wasn\u2019t?\n\nEdit: thanks for the feedback. Moving out immediately is not my goal, im not that ambitious lol.  \n\nBeing a caretaker for the baby is not a concern, I DID used to look after my brothers in my early teens but I am incredibly burned out and couldn\u2019t care less about most things so my parents don\u2019t ask me to look after them as much when they\u2019re not home because I won\u2019t do it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it would be stupid if they left a baby under my care rn.\n\nOk now that I\u2019m thinking about it they still do ask me to look after them but I don\u2019t look after them. Probably makes me a shit sister, I mean I am one which is why they shouldn\u2019t ask me to look after a BABY cuz I\u2019m not gonna do a good job", "created_utc": 1681250319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iz8ob/aita_16f_for_getting_angry_at_my_mum_for_getting/", "score": 414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
