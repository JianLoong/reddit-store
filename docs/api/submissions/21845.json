I know her job gets stressful so I didn\u2019t push for an excuse, but she still attended the wedding. \n\n\nWhen I did the proposal boxes I told everyone that they should expect to spend about $500 for their outfits and bachelorette stuff. No one seemed to mind the cost. In exchange I spent a good amount on the bridesmaid gifts like skin care, robes and slippers with their names on it, spa gift certificate, etc. The bridesmaid who dropped out has a basic name (like Hannah) so I just gave her gift box to my cousin since I couldn\u2019t get a refund on most of the items. \n\n\nMy cousin and my sister were showing off their gifts on TikTok, and my sister told me that \u201cHannah\u201d asked her if they paid for the robes during the wedding. My sister didn\u2019t think much of the question and told her it was a gift. \n\nThis morning Hannah asked me when she could pick up her gifts. I told her they were a thank you gift to my bridesmaids and she attended the wedding as a guest, so I gave hers away. Her mom called me and told me I was being spiteful for giving away her gifts especially since she attended all the bachelorette events (not the rehearsal dinner but the bach party, dress shopping, and the wedding) and since we have been friends for so long I should have considered her feelings. I told her I didn\u2019t even think Hannah was coming and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nWas I being an ass for giving it away?

The gifts were for the bridesmaids. She wasn't a bridesmaid, at her own request. \n\nIn fact pulling out at the last minute was fairly rude, even if she was pissed at you giving away her gift she should have the grace to understand that she doesn't get to complain about your behaviour given her own questionable way of operating. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.", "NTA..the gifts were for the bridesmaids, she decided to drop out without telling you why so you dont have to give it to her just cause your friends.", "Info: did she spend money for the bachelorette party? Did she get you a gift?", "YTA based off this comment:\n\n'I didn\u2019t ask and she didn\u2019t give a reason. I\u2019m really not sure if she got a dress. They were pretty expensive and I don\u2019t know where else she would wear it.'\n\nIf my bridesmaid dropped out one of my first questions would be 'why', quickly followed with a 'is everything ok'. \n\nI also find it interesting that you expected your bridesmaids to spend a significant amount of money on dresses etc and spent your funds on random crap for them...and you gave then gave this bridesmaid's gifts away to make some weird point. As if she hadn't been there for your bachelorette, dress shopping etc. Very odd.", "INFO:\nWhy did she drop out? Did she already pay for the dress etc?", "YTA. So since it was just days before the wedding when she dropped out - she was involved in the entire process, went to the bach party, went dress shopping etc etc - meaning you must have already had her gift before she dropped out. Was it personalized? Did you manage to replace her in the wedding party mere days before? Did that person get her gift? You know, since the gifts we\u2019re for bridesmaids only. \n\nYou\u2019re an even bigger asshole for the fact that your \u201cgood friend from highschool\u201d dropped out of your wedding DAYS BEFORE and you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to ask her WHY. My guess is you are why.", "NTA\n\nWasn't a bridesmaid, doesn't get the bridesmaid gift.\n\nThe only thing she did that was different from just any other wedding guest was the dress shopping. (Or was the bachelorette party just the party? Most of the ones I've gone to were other friends as well) Her taking a trip to Vegas for the party doesn't mean she is \"owed\" any gifts. \n\nI'd be pretty embarrassed if my mommy called the bride to bitch because I didn't get the pretty presents for the job I didn't do. \n\nCongratulations on your marriage!", "NTA...She dropped out without a reason, so why should she get a thank you gift?  It's incredibly rude of her to even ask.", "INFO: What **really** caused her to drop out? It's quite impossible that you do not know. You are voluntarily omitting very important information, and it looks like you're doing it to paint yourself in a pretty light.\n\nWhat kind of fight did you two have for you to basically react as \"fuck off\" when she told you she was dropping out of her role?\n\nDon't play innocent. If she really did drop out without any reason, it's not normal that you did not discuss it in any way, as if she was a stranger you've never met. If she was close enough to be your bridesmaid, it makes no sense that she'd go away without reason.\n\nSo, do tell for a correct judgement: What happened between you two, or even between her and the rest of the bridesmaids?", "ESH. \n\nYou don't know why Hannah dropped out. You didn't ask (???!!!). You definitely gave away non-returnable items to rando cousin out of spite, as the cousin sure wasn't in the bridal party and didn't contribute anything to the Bachelorette party, for example. You bought expensive useless crap rather than, saying, going halfsies on the dresses.\n\nYou have zero curiosity about what happened, and Hannah didn't offer a reason. This is bizarre.", "ES - its a lot of money.  So you instead of the 'proposal boxes' you could have paid for the dress etc?  You chose to spend $500 each instead of just $500 from you.  None of that makes sense to me", "YTA\n\nWhy are you making them pay for their dresses and then spending things on random crap? Use that money to cover the cost, or part of the cost, of the dresses and bachelorette stuff.", "I\u2019m gonna say slight YTA because you couldn\u2019t get your money back anyway. If you were going to send them back and get a refund, then I\u2019d say go for it. But since you can\u2019t and gave it to someone else it does seem a little petty to me. Especially because she did spend money on her bridesmaid duties already.\n\nUnless she dropped out for reasons that have to do with you (thinking you\u2019re a \u2018bridezilla, not supporting the marriage, etc) I think you made a misstep here. And I think if her dropping had to do with her being upset with you, she wouldn\u2019t have attended the wedding at all.", "Your cousin didn't \"earn\" this gift either. Original Hannah did all the things you expected from a bridesmaid leading up to this point.\n\nBut mostly YTA bc someone you're close enough with to be your bridesmaid drops out and you don't seem the least bit concerned about her or why she dropped out. You sound like a terrible friend overall.", "NTA \u2014 the gift is to thank the bridesmaids for standing by you & supporting you on your *actual* big day. \n\nYou were not being petty. You were simply not thanking her for having no part in your wedding day (lol).", "Yeah ur are an asshole no offense queen", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m really not sure if she got a dress. They were pretty expensive and I don\u2019t know where else she would wear it.", "THANK YOU?! I felt like I was taking crazy pills reading that she got her bridesmaids these specialized gift boxes with robes and gift certificates and products versus just, I don\u2019t know, putting that money towards the dresses they are expected to wear for her wedding??? Even if it doesn\u2019t fully cover the cost, you could have made it where they only had to pay like maybe $200-$300 for the dresses. I\u2019d prefer that to slippers", "That was totally what I was thinking when reading through! If she\u2019s spending all this money on gifts to make up for them having to spend so much on their outfits and stuff, why not just put that money to offset what they were spending on the outfits and everything and then do a smaller gift", "So it\u2019s not great and OP should have covered the dress coat as opposed to gifting the boxes. BUT that doesn\u2019t make her an asshole for not giving someone who wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid a bridesmaid gift box. Being that Hannah wasn\u2019t in the wedding we don\u2019t know that she actually bought the bridesmaid dress & shoes. Why should she still get a gift? Not to mention dropping out days before a wedding is incredibly rude.", "Agree", "She played more of a role than the other \"Hannah,\" though.

Not giving her the gift was just petty.", "YTA for making them buy their own expensive dresses just for your event, instead of using the money for the \"gifts\" (which may well have been unwanted by many) to make sure they didn't have to spend so much.", "Wait. She dropped out DAYS before the wedding, which means she would have had to have gotten the dress and any tailoring done, she spent money on the bridal shower, plus her own travel there -- and you didn't ask her why she was dropping out? You didn't ask if she was OK? You hadn't checked in with her about the dress, rehearsal plans, or *anything*?  She went through all that expense, *something* happened and not only do you give away her gift you don't even bother to find out what's going on? What is wrong with you?", "Why didn\u2019t you ask? Don\u2019t you care? If one of my friends had to drop out of my wedding suddenly, the first word out of my mouth would be: \u201cwhy?\u201d", "Yeah, robes and slippers sounds like random clutter. Skin care is highly personal and what works for one person won't work for another. And spa gift certificates... meh. I'd rather pay less for the dress.", "Oh yeah, Hannah sucks too", "Yes true! But I still believe since it was the bride\u2019s gift to give, she could give it to who she wants. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It was her money spent. Also, a cousin is part of your entire life && IMO is more important than a friend who chose not to support you.\n\nETA: Both Hannah\u2019s were not part of the bridal party.", "I\u2019m a licensed beauty professional and I would never want skincare gifted to me (I have too much product already!) and I would equally never gift it to someone else without it being a situation where like, they requested a certain brand that they know works for them. I get brand discounts because of my license but I still think that is a waste of money as a bridesmaid gift versus bringing down the price of a dress I selected for them to wear"]}
