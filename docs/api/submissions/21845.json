No one seemed to mind the cost. In exchange I spent a good amount on the bridesmaid gifts like skin care, robes and slippers with their names on it, spa gift certificate, etc. The bridesmaid who dropped out has a basic name (like Hannah) so I just gave her gift box to my cousin since I couldn\u2019t get a refund on most of the items. \n\n\nMy cousin and my sister were showing off their gifts on TikTok, and my sister told me that \u201cHannah\u201d asked her if they paid for the robes during the wedding. My sister didn\u2019t think much of the question and told her it was a gift. \n\nThis morning Hannah asked me when she could pick up her gifts. I told her they were a thank you gift to my bridesmaids and she attended the wedding as a guest, so I gave hers away. Her mom called me and told me I was being spiteful for giving away her gifts especially since she attended all the bachelorette events (not the rehearsal dinner but the bach party, dress shopping, and the wedding) and since we have been friends for so long I should have considered her feelings. I told her I didn\u2019t even think Hannah was coming and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nWas I being an ass for giving it away? It hurt me that she dropped out, but the gifts were for my party.\n\n\nEdit for FAQ-\nMy cousin Hannah is 15, so no she did not contribute financially or attend the Bach in Vegas. \n\nThe $500 included the dress, flight, and Vegas house. My flight was the most expensive, and my mom paid for that. The shoes, accessories, and makeup was up to them. My MOH took care of their finances so I don\u2019t know anything about that. \n\nI spoke with ex bridesmaid Hannah finally. She did have her dress but gained weight and couldn\u2019t fit and there was no time for alterations and that\u2019s why she dropped out. I could not tell by looking at her.\n\nI didn\u2019t know, but I apologized for giving away her stuff.", "created_utc": 1688996317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vuc6v/aita_for_giving_away_an_ex_bridesmaids_gift/", "score": 4200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had this happen when I got married. Literally all of my bridesmaids dropped out. One of them couldn\u2019t afford the options given and instead of just telling me while we could figure it out (my dad also offered to cover her dress if she needed), she just\u2026didn\u2019t.

Another blew up our entire friendship with some nasty texts, years later she reached out to apologize. She let me know then that she didn\u2019t buy the dress and freaked out instead of telling me or asking for help.

I can\u2019t imagine ever asking my friends to pay for their dresses, my costs for the hen party, multiple pre wedding events and meals etc. The only thing my bridesmaids  shelled out for was my hen weekend for their own hotel and flight but we agreed we wanted a girls trip and decided together where we wanted to go and a budget we were all happy with, we kept the cost minimal and who ever wanted to come did so. A few of my friends didn\u2019t and that\u2019s cool, their money and time. I\u2019d never expect people to be out of pocket doing something they didn\u2019t want too hen do wise or to be part of my wedding.

There are plenty of cultural things I think are different but equal, but this is one where I think our way is clearly better. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nThe person I was replying to said that women don't like being asked to be bridesmaids because it's so expensive. I think that's really sad. Also that brides try to choose dresses that can be worn again rather than elaborate ones... not that big a problem but still a bit sad that they feel they have to tone down what they want because it's not their money. Better just to pay for it and have exactly what you envisioned without the guilt. Especially since trying to compromise probably won't work and the dresses won't be worn again anyway.\n\nAlso the budget thing I mentioned before - if the attendants' outfits come out of the wedding budget then everyone controls their own spending. If you want your bridesmaids in expensive designer dresses to match your luxury wedding then you pay for that. If you're okay with $40 dresses to match your budget wedding then you pay for that. Brides dictating to their friends how much of their own money they have to spend to achieve the bride's vision for her wedding day just makes no sense.", "If the bachelorette party is a multi day trip in another city then yeah it\u2019s gonna cost money.

Her reasoning made me feel bad for bridesmaid and makes OPs giving if the gift away feel even more petty, not that OP knew at the time.

If you knew you had issues with weight gain of flux before, you would probably know by this point to take precautions. \n\nAnd my biggest point is, Weddings are *REALLY* stressful. You are busy, and being pulled in several directions, you have meeting after meeting to plan and decorate. You drop tons of money into it. And this BM didn't even tell her she was still attending, she just dropped off and expected full benefits.
