He got out the card and we basically did our shopping in silence. I felt pretty bad about the whole thing but I didn't think what I did was terrible.

I am not underestimating mental disabilities but it's much harder for people in wheelchair to move through parking lot than people with anxiety.

Your boyfriend can walk from other parking spots just fine. His anxiety is not obstructing him from getting out of the car and walking to the building so it's better to keep the spots open for people who really need them.", "NTA, but a conversation with your boyfriend might be in order. Why does he prefer to park in the disability spot? Does parking or walking to the supermarket increase his anxiety? Does he feel like parking in a close spot is a \"perk\" that helps with the rest of the things he has to face?It might just be that he is feeling self-concious having an invisible disability.", "NTA... This type of parking spot is mostly for physical disabilities or at least other serious disabilities like ppl with certain syndromes, at least that's how it works here. Pretty sure someone with social anxiety can park somewhere else too.", "NTA\n\nYou parked in a close-by spot. What does it matter where you park.\n\nAnd I can see your reasoning. I've always thought those were for physically disabled people. Apparently not, otherwise he wouldn't have gotten his disability card. But what difference does it make to him where you parked? Did he have trouble getting out of the car? Or walking the extra steps?", "NTA. I have never heard of such a thing, a disability placard for anxiety? The spots are supposed to be for mobility issues\u2014heart conditions, muscular issues, pain, breathing, as well as for space to load/unload a wheelchair. His anxiety doesn\u2019t prevent him from actually entering a store and shopping, but he needs to park 50 feet closer to do it? Nothing about this makes sense.", "I don\u2019t understand. Why does the parking spot affect his anxiety?", "of course, *of course* this isn't the disability olympics and all disabilities are valid, visible and invisible. but... aren't the accessible parking spots largely for people with physical impairments? like isn't that the point of them being the closest spots to the store?", "NTA unless there is some reason why parking two spaces over created a significant barrier for him.

Especially when he isnt the person driving.\n\nI also fail to see why he would want to use one of the handicapped places when he has to know his physical capabilities exceed that of most people who use the handicapped parking places. \n\nI am considered disabled but i have never used the handicapped parking because i know many people have worse issues than me.  \n\nThese days, many people feel that they are entitled to use the handicapped parking because it is closer and more convenient, whether or not they are handicapped.  Ive seen many people use them who dont have handicapped license tags or placards to hang inside the car.  Sometimes it is pregnant women, women with kids, or completely able bodied men of all ages without handicapped tags that i observe exiting the car.  That is the really sad state things are in when able bodied people have no compassion or empathy for truly handicapped people whose lives are adversely affected by their physical disabilities, and feel they have as much right to use the handicapped parking because it is more convenient.", "Sorry .. no hate here at all... how does having a handicap plaq for a car when you have social anxiety helpful?
