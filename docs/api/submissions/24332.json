He got out the card and we basically did our shopping in silence. I felt pretty bad about the whole thing but I didn't think what I did was terrible.

I've always thought those were for physically disabled people. Apparently not, otherwise he wouldn't have gotten his disability card. But what difference does it make to him where you parked? Did he have trouble getting out of the car? Or walking the extra steps?", "NTA. I have never heard of such a thing, a disability placard for anxiety? The spots are supposed to be for mobility issues\u2014heart conditions, muscular issues, pain, breathing, as well as for space to load/unload a wheelchair.

Especially when he isnt the person driving.\n\nI also fail to see why he would want to use one of the handicapped places when he has to know his physical capabilities exceed that of most people who use the handicapped parking places. \n\nI am considered disabled but i have never used the handicapped parking because i know many people have worse issues than me.  \n\nThese days, many people feel that they are entitled to use the handicapped parking because it is closer and more convenient, whether or not they are handicapped.  Ive seen many people use them who dont have handicapped license tags or placards to hang inside the car.  Sometimes it is pregnant women, women with kids, or completely able bodied men of all ages without handicapped tags that i observe exiting the car.  That is the really sad state things are in when able bodied people have no compassion or empathy for truly handicapped people whose lives are adversely affected by their physical disabilities, and feel they have as much right to use the handicapped parking because it is more convenient.", "Sorry .. no hate here at all... how does having a handicap plaq for a car when you have social anxiety helpful?

And to everyone else who keeps on digging against the guy, both you and those with disabilities shouldn't pull each other down with the Suffering Olympics.", "There's no reason he needs that spot when physically capable.

How on earth do you not see that your bfs reaction is the EXACT reason he needs the badge and needs the space?????\nHave you done any research into Autism??? Because it really doesn't seem like you have, and if you have then that's possibly even worse because you're so unkind to him. \n\nThe fact that he reacted this way is the exact reason why he needs the parking space - you purposefully made a last minute change, based on your assumptions and then caused your bf to react the way he did due to his Autism and his anxiety.  You literally and willfully caused him emotional distress. \n\nHe needs the blue badge because he needs some certainty over where he is able to park.  He needs the routine of parking in a certain space and he needs to know that he will be taking a specific route from the space to the shop due to his Autism and anxiety.    If those things change, and he is not able to access these spaces (because YOU decided that he didn't need it) - well you've seen how he reacts.  He did not have control over that reaction, his reaction is WHY he's been given the blue badge. \n\nYou have to give so much evidence for a blue badge, and even more so for \"invisible\" things such as mental health and Autism... So why on earth do you think you have ANY right to then decide that actually, now he's gone through submitting all of that, and getting approved... To decide actually nope...

So my elderly mother needs a wheelchair when she leaves her care facility.   I have trouble finding spots when we go out and I need the space to load and unload her wheelchair.
