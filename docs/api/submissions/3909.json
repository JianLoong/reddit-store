You should let your mom do as she chooses. If she is grateful to you for being her caregiver and wants to show gratitude for that I think that\u2019s very appropriate. If anyone tries to put you on the defensive for it just say your mom made her wishes known and you will abide by it.", "NTA\n\nMom's money, Mom's decision.\n\nIf this does pan out the way it looks, when you receive your inheritance have a will written.

She gets to decide what she leaves to others. This being said, you also get to decide what to do with the inheritance. If you wanna spoil your nephews and nieces, no one is gonna stop you from doing that.\n\nYou might want to consult a financial advisor before anything, to help you set things properly for you (and to any person you would give something, if you give aways something). That might helps you to set some things in perspective too.", "NTA this is what your mom wants, how she wants to thank you and wants to take care of you considering your health problems. \n\nBut do be prepared for your family to fight you on it. Family can get uncharacteristically nasty and manipulative when it comes to inheritances. Stand firm in your mother's wishes, and make sure you are taken care of for yourself. \n\nI have chronic illness myself, and it can greatly affect the ability to be self sufficient. This is a gift from your mom so that she doesn't have to worry about you and you don't have to have so much pressure on yourself. It's kind to think of your nieces and nephews, but you will need this more than they do right now.", "NTA she wants you to have it. That said, this could cause conflict for you that makes it not worth it in the long run, so I would talk to my siblings now.

Upon inheritance, it\u2019s yours to do with as you wish during your expected reduced lifespan.  You may think of it as your mother gifting you for what you, and nobody else, would do and in light of your different family circumstance.  You may choose to make some gift in your own will of what, if anything, remains.  But do not be guilted.  Your siblings chose their own lives and to have their own children without any obligation on mom to support them, in whole or in part.  That doesn\u2019t become your obligation on her passing.", "NTA- She's possibly leaving it all to you as much because of your reduced life span, which I assume comes with enhanced life costs, medical bills etc. You are looking after her, let her do this to look after you, and write the niblings into your will.", "YWNBTA.  She is basically paying you for being her caregiver and helping her to remain in her home.  Research the cost of assisted living and nursing home care before declaring that her will is unfair to the other family members.  You can name your nieces and nephews in your own will.", "NTA. However, your mum should explain her reasons to her other children so they understand. FWIW, being a full time caregiver is a tough job and should be compensated IMO. You mum is unlikely to be able to pay you a salary while alive so it is reasonable to compensate you in her will. Even if she is just doing it because she is worried you can't \"work\" a \"normal\" job after she dies, it should not come as a shock to the other siblings. Encourage her to talk to them about her will. Otherwise, mum will pass away and the siblings will have no one to take their hurt out on except OP. It may be mum's decision what to do with her money but it does hurt to have it rubbed in your face that you are not a favoured child. OP could lose her entire family over this. Whereas if they know and understand, they can grieve together. I am assuming OP's family are reasonable people.", "NTA\n\nIT IS UR MOMS WILL. DO NOT CHANGE IT.\n\nIT IS WHAT SHE WANTS.", "Undoubtedly, your family will try to guilt trip you into \"sharing\".  Please resist these efforts.  It is not your responsibility to take care of your nieces and nephews - that's the job of their parents.  Where were all these people when your Mom was ill?  Your mother wants you to have this money; please respect her wishes.", "NTA. I also have narcolepsy (1) and the best thing ever for my health is not working full time. Unfortunately you need to work to get insurance that isn't shit and many narcolepsy meds are super expensive. Caregiving is not easy. It's a very expensive position to hire someone to do. If your siblings are able-bodied and have stable finances, why do they need/deserve money?", "NTA\n\nCurious thou... Why do you say you have a reduced life span?? You only mention narcolepsy and that won't reduce how long you live (I have Narcolepsy so this is knowledge from experience)", "NTA\n\nThis is your mom's wish for her money.  Your nieces and nephews are for their parents to provide for. Not their grandmother.  Most of the time the inheritance from a parent is distributed to their children (or if the child is dead, to their children).  Most of the time it benefits everyone down the line without frog hopping the line of succession.\n\nThere is a reason why your mom wants you to have the house and you may not be privvy to all that information.  For all you know, your mom has already had a discussion with your siblings about the care she isn't getting or they have said to let you have it because you are caring for her and they are fine.\n\nI'm guessing that without your mom leaving you what she has, you will have no where to live and may not be able to buy a house with the division of property like you are considering.\n\nHow much of a reduced lifespan do you have... you can will your possessions to your nieces and nephews and they will benefit then.", "NTA Nope, no one else seems to be concerned about HELPING you with mom.  The nieces/nephews can help, do they?  If you still feel like helping them, will it to them if your life expectancy is limited.  That way you can fund YOUR life and share with them in your afterlife.", "YWNBTA - your mom has her reasons for her decision and it\u2019s okay to trust them even if it benefits you to.", "Im narcolepsy (2), so dont have quite as bad as most. Still sucks. Thanksgiving i ended up overreaching and fell asleep in a chair.", "Endocrine problems from birth and racked up some impressive injuries that damaged my heart, lungs, and entire digestive track.\nIm basically held together by spite, medication, and complimentary comorbidities.", "Dont know how reduced, but when you have heart, lung, and digestive track injuries that have put you in the hospital multiple times on top of from birth issues its frankly amazing Im still as functional as I am.", "Having narcolepsy alone made me impressed you are able to take care of your mum but add all this in and your a bloody angel. Keep your inheritance and enjoy your life xx", "Im no angel, far from it. \nI just have certain rules.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe share with those siblings that have been her full time cartetaker for years, too.", "NTA. You would be, however, if you went against your mom's wishes. She wants it to go to you for a reason. Be grateful and enjoy your life, it's literally her dying wish.", "NTA. But you could do the right thing.", "YTA\n\nIf you think you are TA for letting your mom disinherit your siblings than YTA. This is going to completely ruin any relationship you have with them. Your mom probably feels a huge debt of gratitude because you are her caretaker. If you want any chance for this not to blow up in your face you need to make sure your mother has a conversation with your siblings about her plans. I get it her money her decision but if you were a stranger or a non relative caretaker everyone would be screaming about undue influence.", "NTA.  You can always will it to your nieces and nephews for when you pass on. \n\nYou can also decide, based on economic factors, whether or not you can afford to set aside amounts for them in college savings, etc\u2026 \n\nWills are wills.  Your parents chose to split their assets in their will and you are the big winner.  Enjoy", "I recently had too many emotions at my wedding and had to take a nap.
