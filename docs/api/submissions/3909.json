You should let your mom do as she chooses. If she is grateful to you for being her caregiver and wants to show gratitude for that I think that\u2019s very appropriate. If anyone tries to put you on the defensive for it just say your mom made her wishes known and you will abide by it.", "NTA\n\nMom's money, Mom's decision.\n\nIf this does pan out the way it looks, when you receive your inheritance have a will written.

I'm sure your mom has her reasons for how is distributing her assets. You don't owe anyone anything she has chosen to leave you.", "NTA - keep it, you need it! Don't feel bad about it.

She gets to decide what she leaves to others. This being said, you also get to decide what to do with the inheritance. If you wanna spoil your nephews and nieces, no one is gonna stop you from doing that.\n\nYou might want to consult a financial advisor before anything, to help you set things properly for you (and to any person you would give something, if you give aways something). That might helps you to set some things in perspective too.", "NTA this is what your mom wants, how she wants to thank you and wants to take care of you considering your health problems. \n\nBut do be prepared for your family to fight you on it. Family can get uncharacteristically nasty and manipulative when it comes to inheritances. Stand firm in your mother's wishes, and make sure you are taken care of for yourself. \n\nI have chronic illness myself, and it can greatly affect the ability to be self sufficient. This is a gift from your mom so that she doesn't have to worry about you and you don't have to have so much pressure on yourself. It's kind to think of your nieces and nephews, but you will need this more than they do right now.", "NTA she wants you to have it. That said, this could cause conflict for you that makes it not worth it in the long run, so I would talk to my siblings now.

Upon inheritance, it\u2019s yours to do with as you wish during your expected reduced lifespan.  You may think of it as your mother gifting you for what you, and nobody else, would do and in light of your different family circumstance.  You may choose to make some gift in your own will of what, if anything, remains.  But do not be guilted.  Your siblings chose their own lives and to have their own children without any obligation on mom to support them, in whole or in part.  That doesn\u2019t become your obligation on her passing.", "NTA- She's possibly leaving it all to you as much because of your reduced life span, which I assume comes with enhanced life costs, medical bills etc. You are looking after her, let her do this to look after you, and write the niblings into your will.", "YWNBTA.  She is basically paying you for being her caregiver and helping her to remain in her home.  Research the cost of assisted living and nursing home care before declaring that her will is unfair to the other family members.  You can name your nieces and nephews in your own will.", "NTA. However, your mum should explain her reasons to her other children so they understand. FWIW, being a full time caregiver is a tough job and should be compensated IMO. You mum is unlikely to be able to pay you a salary while alive so it is reasonable to compensate you in her will. Even if she is just doing it because she is worried you can't \"work\" a \"normal\" job after she dies, it should not come as a shock to the other siblings. Encourage her to talk to them about her will. Otherwise, mum will pass away and the siblings will have no one to take their hurt out on except OP. It may be mum's decision what to do with her money but it does hurt to have it rubbed in your face that you are not a favoured child. OP could lose her entire family over this. Whereas if they know and understand, they can grieve together. I am assuming OP's family are reasonable people.", "NTA\n\nIT IS UR MOMS WILL. DO NOT CHANGE IT.\n\nIT IS WHAT SHE WANTS.", "Undoubtedly, your family will try to guilt trip you into \"sharing\".  Please resist these efforts.  It is not your responsibility to take care of your nieces and nephews - that's the job of their parents.  Where were all these people when your Mom was ill?  Your mother wants you to have this money; please respect her wishes."]}
