It sounds like you have to set some boundaries with your father, dont talk to you about the kid, no more pictures, that kind of thing. NTA", "ESH. Your dad for having a kid via affair. Also you for basically being unwilling to support yourself financially. Seems shitty that if you didn't need his money you would have no problem telling him off. My mom is a lovechild and the greatest thing was when her biological dad's family accepted her with open arms (she was an adult) and I have had the pleasure of getting to know my grandpa.

While having a relationship with the half-sister would be good if you did want it, it isn't acceptable to force someone to have that kind of relationship- especially since it isn't something your family likes to talk about.\n\nThis does get complicated though because of the financial aspect, but knowing only the information we do, I think you are in the right.", "Info, are you over 18", "NTA at all.  But it does sound like you have a tough choice.  Man it sucks that you have a father that would cut you off like that just because you didn't do exactly what he wanted.", "NTA", "Info\n\nIs there a way that you can get financial assistance from somewhere else?", "My father also had a child, a boy, my brother, from an affair. We knew straight away since he wanted his children to know each other. I spent years resenting my brother instead of resenting my dad. I was young (around 11/12) and was how i reacted.\n\nYears passed and despite the 10 years difference we became great friends. From all my siblings (we're 7) we're the most alike.\n\nHe past away last year from a car accident. He was 24 years old. It was the biggest pain i have ever felting and now, one year later, I'm still not over it. Sometimes my mind goes back to those early years when i resented him and I'm filled with regret and guilt. \n\nMy point is, NTA for not wanting to meet your dad's affair child. But maybe, just maybe, if you give it a chance your life will be so much richer.", "NTA but if you put yourself in the child's shoes, you might see things differently", "NTA", "NTA per se. You don't have to meet your father's lovechild. But I do think that your actions may do more to harm the child than you may be realizing.  I think you're wanting to stick it to your dad,  and you will,  but you're also sending this little girl the perception that she's unwanted and embarrassing, and I think she might be collateral damage in your fight with your father.", "NTA. I find this a bit weird that he is pushing his affair child on to you. I get the whole argument it\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault but it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s abusing his position of being in financial control which isn\u2019t fine and apparently the whole family is to scared to challenge him he gets away with it.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to meet this kid and gross of your father to push pictures of her on your messages. Tell him clearly that you\u2019re not interested to meet her now, and to stop insisting.", "NTA", "I agree, just how that is what I need to find out I guess.", "While it's great that your mom's family accepted her, the bio family does not need to accept an affair child with open arms though. Blood doesn't mean that they are automatically family. The affair child is a stranger to op and if op doesn't want to form a relationship why should he have to?", "Hmm you do have a point. I automatically think that he expects me to take care of her because he mentioned multiple times about him growing old, tired and won't be able to work in couple years. I could be jumping to conclusions very quickly. \n\nI have nothing against that child. I think I need time to think things over, get stuff straight and then go forward.", "I see. I see. I need to wait a few more years when I have more time and ability.", "I am", "it's not just mine it's the entire family. It's really hard because I am still in university and there is a limit to what I can do. Other family members all have their own lives and stuff. They are willing to help but there is an extent to how much help they can give", "I am very sorry for your loss. I understand your point and maybe in the future. When I am in a better state I will. Thank you.", "I do agree. I guess my frustration is more pointed at my father right now.", "I agree. I need more time.", "In a way yes. He is not abusive physically but very taxing mentally.", "I see. I need the courage and think of how to do that.", "They don't, I just have empathy for the girl on the other side. Just sharing my experience.", "I see. Even if now isn't the time I would definitely consider it, I don't know her situation, but she might really need a big sister some day. Maybe since he is getting older he's trying to have a better relationship with her as well and is hoping for his family's support.", "Tell him it makes you very uncomfortable and would prefer not to and leave it at that.  If he insists, tell him you do not want to be reminded of your mother being cheated on and every reminder of this child does that, and the child's presence would be a constant reminder of it.  \n\nAnd if he expects you to babysit the product of his unfaithfulness, you should get whatever money you are hoping to get up front because you can't trust him any more than your mom could.", "He made a mistake and now you're allowing yourself to suffer by holding on to that frustration.  He's had to, or will have to, answer for his transgressions, but shutting out your sister from your life is only punishing her, and to an extent you.", "You can tell him that you\u2019re not ready to meet her right now, that the fact that he and the family knew for a long time doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t come as shocking news to you, and that you need time to process everything. Which I assume it\u2019s not far from what\u2019s happening to you. Good luck, OP.", "I see what you mean there. I know one day I will meet her and be the sister but just not now."]}
