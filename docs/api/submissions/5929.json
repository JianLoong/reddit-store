It is assumed that the other parent has a higher and steady income and can arrange for other housing pretty easily.

I don't get those kinds of people, and I'm just so glad that you stood your ground!", "INFO - Are you currently homeless? Do you and your husband not have a house now that his late wife\u2019s house was left to your stepson? \n\nIf not, then YTA. If you can\u2019t understand why a mother would want to provide for her child after she dies you need to do some soul-searching. \n\nAlso, you having a tantrum is only making you look bad and showing your true colors to your husband, meanwhile his son is being supportive and loving. Your temper is backfiring and you\u2019re just alienating yourself from your relationship and family instead of achieving your petty goal of alienating your stepson.", "Yta", "YTA. \nThrew a fit? What the fuck is wrong you? You turn your back on your husband when he needed you the most for the most garbage reason imaginable and then have the audacity to argue with him about this.", "YTA. Your husband needed you and you weren't there.", "Sound like a bit of a gold digger tbh", "You\u2019re a gold digger. Husband should leave you asap", "Wtf? Why would your husband get inheritance from his ex-wife. The son got it which is how it usually works. And seems like that's the only reason why you hate the son.

I don\u2019t recall anything in my wedding vows saying anything about money!", "YTA", "I feel like there\u2019s a lot of missing information about your problems with his son, and without that information it\u2019s hard to think of any judgment besides YTA. \n\nIf your \u2018side\u2019 is more sympathetic than it first appears, then you need to go into more detail. As it is, it sounds like you\u2019re upset that your step-son inherited things from his mother, and you\u2019re placing these feelings above your husband\u2019s well-being.", "YTA you\u2019re upset your stepson got his mothers own property? Gold digger aisle 5", "YTA.\n\n\"cannit \\[sic\\] be acting surprised when I'm uncomfortable.\"\n\nGood god. Your husband got into a car crash and needed surgery. Get some perspective. You feeling uncomfortable is nothing in comparison. Your inability to that aside in his times of need makes you a bad spouse and a definitive AH.", "YTA. And a bad, selfish person.", "YTA. Your husband needed you and you decided that some pettiness was more important than being there for him. I see your hatred is more important than your love.", "YTA. I can't fathom being this selfish in a situation where your husband (the partner YOU chose to marry) got into a car accident and definitely needed your support. The son is the least of your problems in this situation.", "YTA. I suspect everything is about you in your life.", "YTA. You sound like a gold digger lol. It\u2019s the dudes mom and you\u2019re upset because you couldn\u2019t profit off her death? \n\nYour husband could have died and you won\u2019t go see him because his son who probably sees you for what you are was simply there?

He made it clear thats his son.", "**YTA.** \n\nYour husband is 45, so you're probably the same age. Yet I'm willing to bet even the 21-year-old son would've been polite and cordial. This isn't about your petty, sad infighting. \n\nWhat the Hell does inheritence have to do with any of this? You're a gold-digger. Your husband has every right to be angry at you -- personally, I'd probably divorce you. Too many red flags.", "YTA - this whole situation wasn't about you, but you made it about your problem with his son. He's in the hospital. Be the bigger person for a few minutes and act like a loving spouse.", "YTA. You should have set aside your differences with your husband\u2019s son for the sake of your husband. Besides which, it really sounds like you care about your husband\u2019s inheritance a little *too* much.

You\u2019re a heartless gold digger.", "YTa. First off it\u2019s your husband act like the adult you are supposed to be.

Let it go.", "YTA", "Yta.  Sorry, but you totally are.  It\u2019s your husband, your best friend for LIFE.  And you wouldn\u2019t go be with him cuz someone you don\u2019t like is there?  Wtf?  Idc, if Satan himself was there\u2026\u2026that is YOUR SOULMATE!  You go and be there!  I cannot fathom, anyone keeping me from my hubby\u2019s side.  SMH!", "YTA for not seeing your husband.

If not, that sounds like that\u2019s a problem you\u2019d have with your husband\u2019s deceased ex, not his son. What are the other reasons you don\u2019t get along? Surely they can\u2019t be that major if you didn\u2019t even bother to list them.\n\nWithout more details about what actually caused this distaste for the son, I don\u2019t see any way in which you\u2019re not the asshole in this situation. And that\u2019s completely disregarding the fact that you should be able to temporarily put aside the bad feelings to be there for your husband.", "YTA.  You should have been there for your husband.  Period.", "You've shown your true colors OP. This wasn't about you, it was about your husband, and you couldn't be there for him when he needed you bc your pettiness with his own son is more important. He's doing the right thing bc choosing to have a relationship with his son, and whether you loke it or not his son comes first no matter what age he is. You're being childish and deserved to be ripped a new one by your husband.

He was /in the hospital for major surgery/ and you put your discomfort of being in the same room with someone you don\u2019t like above that. Are you always that selfish or do you just not give a shit about your husband.", "YTA. We've all heard of gold diggers, but I think this is the first gold digging story I've heard where the gold you were digging for was money that belonged to your husband's late wife! Wow. I think you need to get a grip.\n\nIt seems like you're not willing to answer any questions about the inheritance issue, but it's very likely that your stepson did absolutely nothing wrong and simply accepted the inheritance that was left to him. If he somehow acted against the terms of the will and took inheritance that was left to your husband, then this could have been easily handled in court, and your stepson would have been forced to return the inheritance to your husband. Clearly, this isn't what happened.\n\nBut even if we were to give you the HUGE benefit of the doubt and assume for the sake of argument that your stepson somehow ended up with money or property that should have gone to your husband, how is this any of your business? That's an issue between your husband and his son, relating to your stepson's mother and your husband's late wife. It has nothing to do with you at all. And your husband is fine with it, so why are you still this angry, to the point that you \"can't handle being around\" your stepson even when it comes to visiting your husband in the hospital? That's wild. So even in this hypothetical situation, giving you the total benefit of the doubt, you're still an A and you need to get a grip.", "YTA \u2014 your husband needed your support and you didn\u2019t give it to him because you hold a grudge against a kid!?!? Man I\u2019d hate to have a partner like that.", "Anyone else feel like there is just a whole armada of 'missing missing reasons' floating behind this post?\n\nBut yeah, based on the clearly incomplete information presented, YTA. Your husband is hospitalized and required surgery, but you can't be \"uncomfortable\"? /boggle", "I never would have missed one of my wife's hospital stays. I don't care who was there. I wouldn't have acted like a child and not shown up. I had to go with her at least a dozen times and I was there every minute I was allowed to be there. Then again that's probably why you're remarried and why I was only married once. Cancer and in my marriage and the selfish talk drives me nuts. I did nothing to deserve my loss but I hear this selfish stuff and it drives me crazy. You're an asshole.", "YTA. Seems like all you care about is dollar signs and you're willing to be petty and sabatoge your relationship and ditch your recovering husband over it. You're on the right path if your plan is to watch any inheritance your husband may have go to his son and none for you. Do you have even a smidge of compassion for your loved ones? Grow up.", "Because why is she so worried about something that has nothing to do with her", "No, they're a right if they're properly probated, but I'm having a real issue understanding how the son \"cost\" OP's husband the inheritance.  Unless it just means he's living in the house they both inherited and the husband won't demand that he buy him out or pay him rent.  \n\nBut OP is definitely YTA for letting that get in the way of seeing her husband after his accident.  For a week(!).", "The only way I can see him \u201ccosting his dad the inheritance\u201d, would be if mom was terminally ill, dad was stepping out with a side piece. The current step mom. Son found out, told his mom, and she thanked him for his honesty by changing the will.", "This. Or mama knew she was on the way out, and pops thought he could get away with a side piece. Till the will was read.", "My theory is, real mom was terminally ill, dad was stepping out with step mom, then a side piece. Son found out, broke down to his mom. And new step mom and dad didn\u2019t know anything about it till the reading of the will.

You didn\u2019t say ex wife so this was presumably before you we\u2019re together so how on earth would a child influence an inheritance?     Estates  are usually dealt with by solicitors in accordance the wishes of the deceased or relevalent laws etc.  They don\u2019t normally ask grieving children what they should do with the house?! \n\nWhatever - YTA  obviously as your husband is ok with it and you can\u2019t avoid his son forever and you said you would be there.", "That\u2019s easy. OP is a gold digger. That was HER inheritance too in her mind", "Are you worried that your husband will leave a generous inheritance to his son?", "No.  My mom got his name off the house. He had leg to stand on. He was just trying to be difficult.", "I'm curious too.", "But in what world would it be hers?\n\nEither \n\na) OP was with husband when \u2018late wife\u2019 died and therefore husband was separated or having an affair, and late wife left house to son.  Op upset house went to son- but if she was in a relationship what did they expect! \nOr b) op husband and late wife were still happily married when late wife died, wife will house to son,  BUT this is all before OP is on scene so why upset by it? \n\nI just don\u2019t understand in which world OP is upset about missing out on an inheritience due to the action of her husbands son..", "that is absolutely glorious", "My thinking is she wanted the husband to get the house and either sell it, (making the money hers and his), or live in it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s significantly younger than him and was hoping he (husband) would ultimately will it to her. Admittedly, her heartlessness when husband was in the hospital is what\u2019s driving much of my thinking.", "That\u2019s Bill Engvall.", "So pissed with dead late wife for not willing to her husband? After they separated or before he even knew OP? Still don\u2019t understand the entitlement behind her expectation - and it is still nothing to with son. Unless she wanted him to say \u2018sorry OP was right, my mum was mistaken and didn\u2019t mean to leave me her house\u2019. Which is banananananananananananananas. And that is a lot of bananas", "Agree - the thinking is nuts. But this is from someone who refused to visit her husband after major surgery because hIs SoN Was tHeRe. OP clearly has no empathy. Who knows what other twisted crap rolls around in her head.", "Madness. And mean. Sounds like a catch!"]}
