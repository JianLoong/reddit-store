That she's sleeping with her husband after she died? I doubt she ever met her, so her being there just has no meaning at all, this activity you have is to make your mom's family closer to each other even when she's not there, the gf isn't a part of your mom's family, so she has no place in those activities.\n\nI have the feeling that with time going out on your mom's birthday has become less about her and more about having fun with family in your dad's eyes, maybe that's why he doesn't seem to care if you went with them or not as long as his gf's there.", "NAH. \n\nYou're entitled to feel this way and he's entitled to move forward with a dinner celebrating your mom with Kenna and your siblings. \n\nAssuming your parents were happily married when she died, it's common for spouses to have dying wishes that their widowed/widower spouse  find love again. There was a true story from the dying wife that she even wrote her husband's dating profile because she wanted women to know him the way she knew him and she wanted to make sure he was presented in a honest, raw way that he might not be prepared to do when his wife died. My point is if your parents loved each other, she would want him to be happy. And I think a great gift for her would be knowing your dad was happy and in a loving relationship, and inviting Kenna on your mom's birthday would be a gift to her knowing the love of her life found someone else and wasn't sad or still in mourning. It would also be an opportunity for kenna to learn more about your mom and hear stories about her. \n\nSorry you don't feel up for a visit this year. I hope one day you can be happy for your dad and Kenna and that she be included in those intimate family moments.", "NAH.. What you are feeling is perfectly natural. It's difficult enough to lose a parent, but now you may feel like she's being replaced. Your mom can never be replaced but your dad has a right to find love and happiness again, as do you and your siblings. I'm sure all your mom would want is for all of you to be together and at peace.", "NAH. You are, of course, free to feel how you do. It is understandable that you are upset but I dont think this is disrespectful. Everyone feels grief differently. Unfortunately the world does not stop and life keeps on going.   You never really stop feeling sad, you just learn to how to keep on living with it. Everyone does that at their own pace. Your dad was able to do that and now has a new person in his life. I can only guess at his motives, but it would seem that he still honors/remembers his past but is including the way forward now too. He may view this as an important part in his healing while also showing his kids that life does keep going.", "Info: Are you accepting of the relationship between your dad and Kenna? What is the relationship between you and Kenna?", "YTA.  Your dad has been involved with Kenna for two years, and now he wants to include her in the family tradition.  Nothing wrong with that.\n\nFrankly, I'm getting vibes that you're viewing Kenna as an interloper, not just on your Mom's birthday, but in general.  It's been 8 years since your Mom's death, and your dad is moving forward in life with a new partner, and you're having a hard time with it.", "Why is her presence so disrespectful to you? As you said, it's family time - I think your dad considers his partner as some kind of a part of his family. Maybe he wants her to be there. Reading your post I don't feel like she's going to be there just because they want to \"hang out\" as any other day, maybe she will be there to support your dad. I think YTA, not a big one at least.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI might get this if he'd just started dating her, but 2 years is a long time.  It's also been a long time since your Mom died, meaning he's not forcing a parade of ladies on you.  (I assume that, anyway).\n\nI was older when my mom died (21), but my dad found someone within 3 months.  Of course we were shocked, but his happiness was obvious and he's not one to be impulsive.   Now it's 15 years later, they're still very happily married and she's one of my fave people.\n\nNot predicting this for you or anything, but just pointing out your dad has the right to happiness, which will eventually impact your \"family\".", "INFO\n\nHave you considered Kenna is family to your father?

You have a right to your feelings. This is an important day to remember your mom, and your dad's in the wrong for trying to bring his girlfriend into it. I do think it would be good to figure out a way to make it up to your younger siblings, but I absolutely don't think you're wrong for taking this stand.", "nta. like you said, it's family time. the gf shouldn't be welcomed into something as intimate as that.", "NTA. He should\u2019ve asked if Kenna could come instead of assuming she\u2019d be allowed. It\u2019s a get together specifically for your late mom\u2019s kids and their father. The same courtesy of asking first would also apply to any spouses if you or your siblings get married/start dating.", "NTA- this is definitely not her place and your dad should 100% be more considerate of your feelings.", "Soft YTA. Normally I\u2019d go more for no AH present but your post makes it seem like you are only concerned with your feelings ante are disregarding anyone else\u2019s. Doesn\u2019t sound like she is just some fling since your dad has been seeing her for 2 years. You are an adult now and you should realize it wasn\u2019t just you that lost her. Your father lost his wife, sounds like he has found happiness in a new relationship and moving forward she will be apart of his life. Her being there for your dad isn\u2019t a slight against you, and might be very comforting to your dad.", "ESH. losing a parent is not easy in the slightest. celebrating her on her birthday once a year is a good reason to sit down with family and remember the wonderful person she was. it really does make sense that you feel some sort of betrayal by having Kenna join in on this years celebration. she didn't know your mom, why should she come along? that said, it sounds like Kenna is important to your dad. and it should also be important to Kenna to recognize the woman that your dad had kids with, instead of just sweeping her existence under the rug. he probably wants her there for a reason and didn't mean to upset you. since it is a yearly tradition with just you and your siblings, i do think he should've asked everyone before inviting her. if i were you i would still go and be with your family on her birthday, maybe things will go better than you expected", "I don't really think your dad's an asshole for wanting to include Kenna on your mom's birthday, so I'm leaning towards NAH. I understand how you feel. But since this is a family time, and he seems to want Kenna to be incorporated into the family, I think he's trying to be a good partner and include her", "YTA - I get it why you\u2019re upset here and this is an adjustment but you need to face the reality of the situation, your father has a girlfriend and she is part of his life.", "Slight YTA, they have been dating a long time and from your responses everyone else in the family likes her. How is her presence disrespectful?", "Soft yta\n\nIf she's been around for 2 years already, then she might be around for the long haul. Your dad and siblings might/ prly already see her as family. \n\nAs your father's significant other, she most likely wants to support him, and be at his side, through difficult times like your mother's anniversary. \n\nYou weren't an ah until you gave him an ultimatum. You could have just said that you don't feel comfortable with her there, and just said that you and him could do something after, but you drew a line in the sand and said that if she was there, you wouldn't be.", "NTA but neither is your dad... \n\nThe process of grief is a very personal one for every individual. The length of this process is also a personal thing. Your father has been dating Kenna for two years now. Do you think that maybe he wants to move on with his life while also respecting his late wife, your mother, by still celebrating her but this year with his partner by his side? Do you still want him to keep up with this tradition 5, 10 or even 20 years from now? Do you want to give him an ultimatum each and every year even if he marries Kenna? You are entitled to your emotions and the feelings you have in this situation, you are definitely NTA, but your dad is allowed to move on with Kenna. Your dad is an adult with a partner, you can't force him to exclude her. No one is an a-hole here. \n\nIf I were you OP, I'd still join the celebration of your mother. I wouldn't let myself be stopped by a guest I don't want to be there. The most important thing is you, siblings and dad being there. Having someone extra won't stop anyone from celebrating the memory of your mother. I'd contact your father and let him know that my feelings were hurt but that I still want this family time and that I still want to take part in the tradition.\n\nI get that you want your feelings to be taken in consideration, but are you taking your fathers feelings into consideration? It is about family time, is Kenna not close family to your father? It is not an easy situation, but in the end it is about your mother and celebrating her. You might regret it if you don't go.", "NTA. It sounds like this was a special tradition you, your dad, and your siblings have done each year. Your feelings are valid to be upset about Kenna being included without a discussion. I would call your dad and calmly explain how you feel. It sounds like he blindsided you and hurt your feelings by not insisting you come home. He needs to understand the optics, that Kenna is more important to him than your feelings or this family tradition. Her being included in the future should be a discussion but you're not ready yet. This is a tradition to honor your mother and it just feels disrespectful to include her. You're not saying he can't move on or that you don't accept her in general. He might need to hear that.\n\nI read something a few months ago that said \"Women grieve, men replace.\" I don't think that's always true but everyone grieves in their own way and your father deserves to find some happiness of his own. He lost your mom too, his wife, his partner. Try to show him some compassion for that. Plus, give Kenna more of a chance for him. It sounds like she has been great to your siblings. They may have thought this would be a time to bond while you're home.  Good luck OP.", "If there is a movie on that my Dad doesn't want to see my mother brother and I will see it. He will watch the cricket or something.\n\nAfterwards he will say \"How was the film? Did you have a good time?\"\n\nLikewise, my mother is capable of excusing herself from events that she thinks sound rather ghastly. Such as a round of mini golf. Or Star Trek. She'll grab a coffee, read a book, and cheer from the sidelines.\n\nWe'll do things together. And we'll do things separately. Like when we tried an escape room and they both ran for the hills but my brother and I had a grand time.\n\nWhen Rugby season is on my brother and I would barricade ourselves in the spare room with the X-Box and only emerge when it was safe to do so.\n\nThat's day to day life. About ordinary things. Things of no consequence. We don't exclude ourselves from things everyone can't do together. We don't invite ourselves to thing that are clearly 'their thing'. That's justs normal.\n\nI'm astonished they don't have the empathy to sit this one out.\n\nWhy doesn't she have the decency to simply say \"Alright, have a nice time\", and settle in for a Netflicks series she'd never get to watch by herself? Why doesn't he care?\n\nNTA at all. Not even a little bit.", "I think no one is the AH. \n\nI think you're completely entitled to feel upset about it and entitled to want to spend the day just you, your dad and your siblings.\n\nBut,\n\nI also think your dad is entitled to move on and if this relationship is serious he shouldn't be expected to banish her for the day. Your dad has had to grieve too and being around Kenna might make him feel better. \n\nI think you just need to sit down with him and talk to him about your feelings, rather than just being stroppy like a bratty child and expecting him to read your mind.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" this should be family time\" .. Kenna is there BECAUSE it is family time.", "NTA. It\u2019s understandable that you see her as an intruder for an event in tribute to your mom. I get why you wouldn\u2019t want to go.", "YTA. It's been 9 years. Your dad is allowed to date again without it being considered disrespectful to your mom. Two years of dating is enough to be considered part of the family for things like this.", "YTA. Exactly how long is your dad supposed to be single before he\u2019s allowed to have another woman in his life, by your personal standards? Nine years not enough to satisfy your pathetic need to see him single?  You\u2019re a completely self-absorbed jerk. While you lost your mom too young, that doesn\u2019t give you the right to own your dad\u2019s life. Geez, asshole, get over yourself. The universe doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "!updateme", "NTA\n\nIt was inconsiderate of him to include the gf without checking how you would feel about it first. I agree with you that this is not a situation that should involve the gf at this point. Maybe you can go home and honor your mom with just your siblings, then have a conversation with your dad about why you felt it was inappropriate for him to invite his gf?", "Two years ago he started dating Kenna , its about time you accept Kenna as family.  \n\"this should be family time\" is probably what your dad is thinking... but he sees his new partner as family by now.", "NTA but everyone grieves at their own pace. Respecting yourself and what you can handle is what's best. Trying to control what others are doing is equally imposing on them and their grief process.

But this is a specific event for a specific group for a specific purpose.", "He is allowed to date again. But bringing his girlfriend to a celebration of his late wife\u2019s birthday is disrespectful, particularly as OP doesn\u2019t see the new gf as family.", "I don't want my dad to be single and have no issues with him dating Kenna or anyone. I just don't think she needs to be involved in this particular tradition yet.", "Why not talk to your siblings and plan something with them without your dad and stepmum, think of things your mum would have loved to do.", "In that case I\u2019m gonna go with NAH. This is just a shit situation. Your Dad may have not approached this the delicately as he should have, but I can understand if he wants to include Kenna in the celebrations. She may also be in a difficult position where she loves your Dad but respects that your mother will always have a piece of his heart. She may intend to acknowledge that by participating on her birthday. It is not, in my opinion, inherently disrespectful to include her. I understand that it\u2019s complex and difficult for you to come to terms with having her there. I hope you can all come together in the future.", "Family is the people you consider family, not only nor necessarily the people that are related to you.", "In the great scheme of things, 2 years is not a long time. It also matters what her relationship is to the kids. Do THEY want her there, or are they just going along with it because dad suggested it and they don't think they can have a different opinion?", "She exists just fine outside of the context of family.  She isn't family until a ring is on her hand.", "Seems like OP doesn't live with her dad and siblings; he might've asked them. I agree that it wasn't overly considerate, I'm just not sure I'd say he was an asshole about it", "It seems like the other children don't care, only OP", "Exactly. I doubt OP would be having the same reaction if his dad simply wanted to invite Kenna to Thanksgiving dinner.", "How many years does she have to be around in order to be good enough to come along?", "I mean, agree to disagree.", "But that's why you ask. Because the kids may be totally cool with it or they may be really uncomfortable with it or, as is the case here, some may be cool with it while others are not.\n\nSpeaking only for myself, if I were the dad I would never prioritize having my gf at this event at the expense of my child. This gathering means so much more to OP than it does to Kenna.\n\nNot even going to get into how the dad has all but guaranteed that OP will resent/dislike Kenna now.", "Not at all she was at Thanksgiving and Christmas last year and probably will be this year too I don't care.", "Why does she ever need to come along?\n\nThe OP said they have spent other holidays together. So it isn't a problem with her existing.\n\nI would be more questioning why she would want to be there.\n\nIt would completely change the dynamics, and really if some one is so insecure in a relationship that they are incapable of being OK with a widow taking his kids for a meal.\n\nThe purpose being for his kids to reminisce about their mother on her birthday it says more about the partner than the grieving kid.\n\nIt's perfectly OK for couples to do things separately as it is families. \n\nThe OP dad has completely unreasonable and seems to have forgotten what the purpose of them spending time together was. \n\nNAH OP, I hope you find a way to celebrate your mam on the day if you do decide not to go.", "OP already dislikes and resents Kenna. This event won't make it worse. OP has met the girlfriend and stated they are \"cordial\" to her and pretty sure OP feels a way about their dad dating someone new. OP was the oldest and probably feels the need to preserve their mom's memory more. For all we know, the dad did ask the two younger ones and they said cool. For all we know, Kenna probably lives with the dad now and that's why she will be there. And OP is framing this as she's coming over to spend the special day with them."]}
