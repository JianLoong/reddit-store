That she's sleeping with her husband after she died? I doubt she ever met her, so her being there just has no meaning at all, this activity you have is to make your mom's family closer to each other even when she's not there, the gf isn't a part of your mom's family, so she has no place in those activities.\n\nI have the feeling that with time going out on your mom's birthday has become less about her and more about having fun with family in your dad's eyes, maybe that's why he doesn't seem to care if you went with them or not as long as his gf's there.", "NAH. \n\nYou're entitled to feel this way and he's entitled to move forward with a dinner celebrating your mom with Kenna and your siblings. \n\nAssuming your parents were happily married when she died, it's common for spouses to have dying wishes that their widowed/widower spouse  find love again. There was a true story from the dying wife that she even wrote her husband's dating profile because she wanted women to know him the way she knew him and she wanted to make sure he was presented in a honest, raw way that he might not be prepared to do when his wife died. My point is if your parents loved each other, she would want him to be happy. And I think a great gift for her would be knowing your dad was happy and in a loving relationship, and inviting Kenna on your mom's birthday would be a gift to her knowing the love of her life found someone else and wasn't sad or still in mourning. It would also be an opportunity for kenna to learn more about your mom and hear stories about her. \n\nSorry you don't feel up for a visit this year.

It is understandable that you are upset but I dont think this is disrespectful. Everyone feels grief differently. Unfortunately the world does not stop and life keeps on going.   You never really stop feeling sad, you just learn to how to keep on living with it. Everyone does that at their own pace. Your dad was able to do that and now has a new person in his life. I can only guess at his motives, but it would seem that he still honors/remembers his past but is including the way forward now too.

It's been 8 years since your Mom's death, and your dad is moving forward in life with a new partner, and you're having a hard time with it.", "Why is her presence so disrespectful to you?

The length of this process is also a personal thing. Your father has been dating Kenna for two years now.

Do you still want him to keep up with this tradition 5, 10 or even 20 years from now? Do you want to give him an ultimatum each and every year even if he marries Kenna? You are entitled to your emotions and the feelings you have in this situation, you are definitely NTA, but your dad is allowed to move on with Kenna.

I wouldn't let myself be stopped by a guest I don't want to be there. The most important thing is you, siblings and dad being there.

I'd contact your father and let him know that my feelings were hurt but that I still want this family time and that I still want to take part in the tradition.\n\nI get that you want your feelings to be taken in consideration, but are you taking your fathers feelings into consideration? It is about family time, is Kenna not close family to your father? It is not an easy situation, but in the end it is about your mother and celebrating her. You might regret it if you don't go.", "NTA. It sounds like this was a special tradition you, your dad, and your siblings have done each year. Your feelings are valid to be upset about Kenna being included without a discussion. I would call your dad and calmly explain how you feel. It sounds like he blindsided you and hurt your feelings by not insisting you come home. He needs to understand the optics, that Kenna is more important to him than your feelings or this family tradition. Her being included in the future should be a discussion but you're not ready yet. This is a tradition to honor your mother and it just feels disrespectful to include her. You're not saying he can't move on or that you don't accept her in general. He might need to hear that.\n\nI read something a few months ago that said \"Women grieve, men replace.\" I don't think that's always true but everyone grieves in their own way and your father deserves to find some happiness of his own. He lost your mom too, his wife, his partner. Try to show him some compassion for that. Plus, give Kenna more of a chance for him. It sounds like she has been great to your siblings. They may have thought this would be a time to bond while you're home.  Good luck OP.", "If there is a movie on that my Dad doesn't want to see my mother brother and I will see it.

She may also be in a difficult position where she loves your Dad but respects that your mother will always have a piece of his heart. She may intend to acknowledge that by participating on her birthday. It is not, in my opinion, inherently disrespectful to include her.
