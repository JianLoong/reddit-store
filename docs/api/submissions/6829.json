You don't ruin their birthday cake. If you look at videos of people pranking each other- couples who are in love (or at least claim to be on the internet)- both people laugh at the prank. I have friendships that involve pranking, and we have NEVER made each other cry. \n\nThe lesson here is for your sons to apologize fully, make it up to her, and agree not to prank her again. \n\nHe didn't \"exaggerate.\" Did she cry on her birthday? Yes. Do you think crying on your birthday makes your birthday awesome or ruins it? Come on. \n\nYour kids are gonna get in to serious trouble later in life if you teach them it is okay to prank people and not take responsibility when it goes wrong, or to understand the context of pranking people (aka, maybe don't mess with someone after they were in the hospital), and if you continue with the idea that you can show love by pranking, when clearly that isn't the case. \n\nThe fact that you defend your boys instead of getting them to apologize and make it up to her tells me all we need to about you and your sons who I can only hope get some parenting from someone, cause it isn't coming from you.", "If your boys thought their prank was so funny, I hope they ate the whole mayonnaise cake.\n\nYTA and your husband is right: you enabled a wrong behaviour.", "YTA - you\u2019re an idiot. You should 100% be punishing your boys. This prank was gross and unfunny and NOT at all a proper way of \u201cshowing they love her.\u201d AND after she got out of the hospital too.\n\nAnd you knew they pranked each other - why would you let them make the bday cake instead of just buying SD one?", "YTA, kids are AH", "YTA. This was such a mean \u201cprank\u201d. I bet she had her heart set on delicious cake and a joyful celebration. Instead she got a mouth full of Mayo.

Cruel under the circumstances.", "You have to know your audience with pranks. Some people think things like this are funny and a lot of people hate it.

Instead of adding icing on the cake, they added mayonnaise. \n\nYour stepdaughter was just sick enough to be in the hospital. She came home, probably still not feeling great, and definitely vulnerable. It was her BIRTHDAY, a day she should have been made to feel BETTER THAN USUAL, loved and happy, and your sons decided to RUIN HER BIRTHDAY CAKE. Explain to me what about that is funny, exactly?\n\n>It didn't go well and my SD's reaction was to cry. My husband blew up at the boys for what they did but they said they were just trying to prank her since it's the norm and they always prank each others. \n\n\"It's the norm\" for your sons to make your stepdaughter cry? Or you're so delusional that you think it's normal for people to do shitty things to their family members on their special occasions? Or you think that \"pranks\" in the form of doing shitty things to people you're supposed to love is \"the norm\" just in general? Please . . . I'm dying to hear which of these options you think is the defensible one.\n\nFurthermore, do you genuinely not get  that the fact that your sons enjoy pranking EACH OTHER, something that they both apparently consent to and do as a MUTUAL entertainment, does not make it even a little bit okay to do those things to other people who haven't consented to be a part of their nonsense and don't enjoy it?\n\n>My husband said it was the wrong time to do this on her birthday especially after getting out of the hospital. He told the boys they ruined her birthday but I told him he exaggarated with this statement. \n\nHow did he exaggerate? In the most literal, bare bones description of the situation, they ruined her birthday cake at a special occasion meant to cheer her up right after she got out of the hospital, and upset her so badly that she cried. How much worse would you need it to be to acknowledge that they ruined her birthday? \n\n> the boys love her that's why they act like this\n\nWow. WOW. Did you actually just claim that your boys RUINED HER BIRTHDAY CAKE AND MADE HER CRY because . . . they LOVE her? Do you also think that hitting people is an expression of love? Calling them ugly names? Like, how exactly do you decide what kind of bullying, cruel behaviour is \"an act of love\"? What's the criteria? Does it have to full-on cause tears, or just destroy something the person was looking forward to?\n\nYTA, and so are your sons, but they've clearly learned this ugly, disgusting behaviour from you, a mother who has taught them to express love through acts of destruction and cruelty. Y'all need therapy, and to leave your poor husband and his daughter alone.", "YTA", "YTA so the cake was completely ruined, right? Was there a \u201creal\u201d cake or just mayo cake?

Now blow the candles!\"\n\nBecause surely the prank was not \"let's ruin the birthday cake so she gets no cake\"? \n\nHow can you even call that a prank? A prank is a joke! Meant to be funny!\n\nYTA", "YTA", ">they were just trying to prank her since it's the norm and they always prank each others.\n\nMaybe teach your sons not to be bullies. It's not a \"prank\" when one child is constantly ridiculed or has their special moments shat on. It's not \"love\" but training for her to misinterpret abusive boundary-stomping behavior as \"love.\" *But they're just teasing her!* No, they aren't, they are making her miserable for their own amusement. \n\nHonestly, YTA and you are raising two cruddy sons.", "Info: can you explain why this was a funny prank to you? Please tell me because I don't seem to get it. \n\n\nYTA and your sons are not pranking, they are being mean. \n\n\nPranks should be something all parties will find funny. This isn't funny and no one except them enjoyed themselves. Not a prank.\n\n\nI'm guessing they do this sort of thing often and you consistently stand up for them? Please consider your SD's feelings and why you're OK with your children having fun at her expense.", "YTA. Wow, yeah. There's a time and place for pranks, but when someone just got out of the hospital, that's not right. Some compassion and extra care would have been nice, and both you and your boys need to apologize for not understanding that.", "I like mayonaise, but SD cried so your boys should apologize for that their prank didn't go over as intented. INFO on what else happened on the birthday. Birtday's usually consist on more than eating cake so I can't judge if this ruined her whole birthday. Did SD get her favourite dinner? Did she get the presents she wished for? Did you all a nice family activity together?", "YTA. You don't mess with food. Especially not a birthday cake. The main things people want on their birthday are presents and then cake. The only time that would be acceptable is if it was a prank cake with a real one to follow. It is especially not cool after a hospital visit.", "YTA and better get that girl a replacement cake.", "Pranks are supposed to be funny for both parties involved, and harmless.

You can love someone and still hurt them so I\u2019m not sure why you are saying that. I\u2019m sure that you love your husband and he has something that hurt you unintentionally. You and your sons should make her a new cake that is beautiful and heart felt and give it to her as an apology. It should go without saying, but actually apologize to her and your husband with words as well. I\u2019m sure that she will forgive them since they have a nice sibling bond, but don\u2019t turn a blind eye to pranks that hurts other even if it wasn\u2019t meant to be hurtful.", "YTA- you even had to ask?", "A prank is only a prank when everyone laughs. When someone (especially little girls who just got out of the hospital) starts crying, it stops being a prank and instead enters the realm of cruelty and bullying. \n\nYTA and your kids are assholes. \n\nYou three seriously need to apologize and start thinking of a way to make this up to your stepdaughter.", "YTA.

Instead of adding icing on the cake, they added mayonnaise. It didn't go well and my SD's reaction was to cry. My husband blew up at the boys for what they did but they said they were just trying to prank her since it's the norm and they always prank each others. My husband said it was the wrong time to do this on her birthday especially after getting out of the hospital. He told the boys they ruined her birthday but I told him he exaggarated with this statement. He got upset and yelled at me for defending this behavior and being an enbler. I don't I am because the boys love her that's why they act like this but my husband was having non of it.\n\n\nBoth he and SD aren't speaking to me nor the boys.

It really wasn\u2019t a waste of money. \n\nIn this case, the boys like pranks and the daughter doesn\u2019t. So don\u2019t do pranks with the daughter. It\u2019s easy if you communicate, listen to, and respect others.\n\nEdit - typo", "Came to say this. No matter how \u201charmless\u201d someone might view a prank through their eyes, if it hurts or upsets another person in anyway it\u2019s not funny or ok. The fact that OP and her sons aren\u2019t acknowledging and apologizing for that is terrible. YTA, OP. Teach your children to be respectful and careful with each other\u2019s feelings. Maybe they really did just misread the room and their original intentions weren\u2019t to hurt her because pranks are something they all generally enjoy normal, but that doesn\u2019t mean they get pass to dismiss her feelings being different this time and refuse to own and apologize for their actions; especially for the very understandable reason of wanting to celebrate after a tough time.", "Yes it's bullying and mum is just trying to sugar coat it so it doesn't sound so bad. Definitely enabling bad behaviour and doesn't care or is oblivious. They need to get a new cake and apologise.", "This comment needs to be higher. What an obvious YTA. Teaching boys it\u2019s okay to hurt people they love is crappy parenting; you are setting up their future romantic partners and children for sadness and hurt.", "I feel like the only way the prank is funny is when they pull out the real cake that they didn\u2019t ruin. If there\u2019s no non-ruined cake then this is just being super mean.", "She was in on it", "Having a backup cake would require some empathy and thoughtfulness, which clearly these people don't have. Your husband is right.", "In all fairness to the sons, presumably it's her fault they don't understand boundaries and what is an isn't appropriate for a prank, if this is how she reacted to such a serious misstep.\n \n\nIf they really do care about their sister, this is a great teachable moment that will cause them to cringe for decades to come if handled correctly.\n\nInstead OP is trying to raise future candidates for workplace harassment training videos.", "Explains why her boys act like that. Sister isn\u2019t sister, she\u2019s dad\u2019s kid.", "Oooh that had passed me by! Good spotting.", "Ooh this makes my blood boil! I know you're being sarcastic, but I know real life people who use this justification. Gross and enabling is all that is.", "Seriously. Pranks are usually only \"funny\" to the person doing it. Yeah, there's harmless ones, but not usually. \nPranks are mostly  just cruel, like OPs kids.", "Exactly. A joke or prank should NEVER be at someone's expense.", "This got me thinking, this would take like half a jar of mayo, which means there is a good chance step mom knew about the prank and helped plan it.", "I hadn\u2019t even thought of that. It\u2019s just keeps getting worse.", "Yep. Shit people have shit kids.\n\nSad cycle.", "An empathetic step-mother would help.", "It\u2019s a dangerous precedent to set for her AND for the boys. They will grow up thinking this is an appropriate way to treat people they supposedly care about.", "Which leads to \"I only beat you because I love you.\"", "No. Without a cure for the prank of ruining the cake, it's not a prank. Plus, they wasted the food.", "But... but it's because they love you!!", "Because some people are cruel and can't personally be happy if those around them are happy.", "No, WIFE is defending her sons for ruining her stepdaughter's birthday.\n\n(I'd love it to be some evil ex. Dad has to live with this woman.)", "Right?  To a sick girl, in the hospital?  What kind of sadistic assholes is this woman raising?", "Exactly. If you\u2019re going to take something from someone when they\u2019re looking forward to it, you better have something even better waiting in the wings.", "Did they post it on Tiktok? If yes, then they probably did it for social media clout, which makes it even worse.", "I literally could not agree more.", "This is the kind of parent who says things like \"It was just 20 minutes of action\" YTA OP.", "My husband tried to say this to our daughter about a boy that was mean to her. I shut that shit down real quick.", "I love that. It\u2019s only funny if everybody laughs.", "I love this response. I don't think either parent handled it well. The brothers may have realized they messed up as soon as she started to cry, but people tend to get defensive when they're yelled at. OP downplayed their behavior when her response should have been to tell them exactly what you said here.", "This could have been acceptable if they had a backup cake, but even then it's very much dependent on knowing the person and it being the right situation.\n\nAnd this was not the right situation.", "Yep! I wonder if the SD had done this to \u201cher\u201dboys if she would be as flippant about it. I have a feeling she wouldn\u2019t be.", "Same. It's nasty and I would have cried as well.", "There *are* harmless pranks - You just don't hear about them because nobody complains about them or posts them on the internet.", "My family pulled that on me once or twice.  It was mildly annoying.  If they had ruined the cake itself, I'd have been very upset.", "YTA, and a future YTA for your sons in 10 years. It's inevitable that they'll be on here asking whether they are TA for \"pranking\" their overreacting wife.", "It would still be an unsuccessful prank, but at least then it wouldn't have been a deliberately malicious one,  just misguided.", "Exactly. And yeah, there are tons of stories out there about relatives, workmates, heck even restaurant staff, deliberately hiding allergens in people\u2019s food because \u201cthey\u2019re faking this allergy, I\u2019ll prove they\u2019re lying\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re not really allergic, they just don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll prove it tastes fine if prepared the right way\u201d. People you should be able to trust.", "what is your problem OP", "YTA. And based on this story I guarantee you take \u201cpride\u201d in being a \u201cboy mom\u201d. \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is probably your mantra. NOPE.", "Definitely the asshole. Poor girls entire cake ruined right after coming out of the hospital :(", "Sorry, can you explain how they DIDN\u2019T ruin her birthday? Making the birthday person cry usually is an indication that someone has. \n\nFYI - this is not a \u2018funny prank\u2019. It\u2019s cruel. \n\nYTA and I\u2019d try and avoid raising and enabling little AHs", "Exactly. My husband's family has a tradition of smashing cake into the birthday person's face. We all know this. On his last birthday I bought my husband a cake from a bakery and spent $125 on it. I told everyone we weren't smashing that cake into his face. My SIL being the boss she is, got a $5 cake from Publix and smashed it into her brother's face. Everyone wins. Cake to eat, cake to smash. \n\nOP is very much TA", "Yeah, me and a buddy pranked a friend with what was basically a balloon covered in icing. It popped when she went to cut the birthday cake, we ALL laughed.  And then we got the actual cake out. \n\nWhat these boys did was take something that was going to be positive (delicious birthday cake--And I bet the whole hospital team had been trying to get her home so she could have a happy birthday, so there would have been more riding on this) and made it negative (mayo cake).  They took something from her, and she was disappointed and upset.  This wasn't a funny prank, it was cruel behaviour disguised as a \"joke\".  You need to teach your boys the difference between bullying (bullies laugh and victim is upset) and a prank (everybody laughs).", "God that line killed me. When I was a kid I experienced so much shit at that hands of my younger brother. He would do literally anything he could to annoy me, he\u2019d call me names and tease me, he had to one-up me in everything, I went years without hearing a good word about me from him. My parents always told me \u201che acts that way because he loves you.\u201d It\u2019s not love, what my brother did may not exactly be abuse but it wasn\u2019t kind either and it\u2019s certainly not how one shows love. Mean spirited pranks aren\u2019t love either. Also it wasn\u2019t even a prank, it was just bullying. Like you said, pranks are only funny if everyone can laugh about it. If they had covered a cheap grocery store cake in mayo and gave that to her first before bringing out the real cake then I could see how that would be funny. All they did was ruin her birthday cake by making it inedible and make her cry. And OP thinks that\u2019s somehow showing love?", "Definitely YTA. And man, the cake is the p\u00e8ice de r\u00e9sistance of any birthday party, and to ruin that moment is a real gut punch. Shit, I\u2019d cry too if someone did that to me. Pranks for major events/parties is just off limits.", "For pranks like this, you MUST have a replacement cake (the real cake) otherwise you are just denying a sick girl her birthday cake", "It makes me think she doesn't love or appreciate her step daughter at all. She thinks this is funny.", "At least socks are useful in some way. I'd reccomend buying buying a ps5 and cracking it open and replacing all the wiring with mayo.", "This was my first thought when OP said that \u201cthe boys love her and that\u2019s why they act like that\u201d!! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nAnd also OP YTA make sure you tell them not to shove cake in their wive\u2019s faces when they get married", "We liked to rag on each other growing up also and my mom introduced the concept of a \u201cmean tease\u201d meaning what you did was beyond the limit and/or insensitive and you needed to apologize and realize what you did was wrong.\n\nI think that was an amazing concept for her to introduce and is probably one of the things that made my siblings and I so empathetic toward others now that we\u2019re adults.", "I don\u2019t think it matters that she was in the hospital. It was her birthday and they ruined one of the best things about birthdays-the freakin\u2019 cake. As another poster said, it would have been different if they had pulled a wonderful cake out as a surprise for the \u2018funny\u2019 one but no. Just left the mayonnaise-frosted atrocity there. Mom needs parenting classes ASAP.", "Yes! Or have it be like a voluntary thing, for example having some extra cupcakes on the side and saying \u201cone of these 5 cupcakes has mayo inside. The rest of the cupcakes are 100% normal.\u201d And then just playing cupcake roulette with whoever wants to participate in that. Extra birthday game instead of a prank on the one and only cake like they did!", "I know right Mayo is just gross", "I hadn't considered that. Agreed: we should be teaching everyone not only to not accept bad behaviour, but also to be better and treat people well.", "Exactly. And people act shocked at domestic violence: \u201cHow could he beat her if he really loves her? Why did she stay with him?\u201d\n\nBecause they have literal decades of this insidious messaging that started in their most formative years. \n\nTHIS SITUATION is exactly how, where, and when kids first learn that \u201che only hurts you because he loves you.\u201d\n\n**OP, YTA times a million**. Please get therapy for yourself and your boys so that they don\u2019t grow up to be abusers.", "This would have actually been a great turn around in the moment. I imagine the brothers seeing her start to cry and in a scramble, grabbing handfuls of Mayo cake and throwing their heads back in fake ecstasy as they stuffed their faces, maybe faking (or not) a few gags: wait WHAAAAT?? You didn\u2019t like our mayo cake?! But mayonnaise cake is so delicious!! Come on mayonnaise cake get in my mouth *gag* oh so yummy *gag* I could eat this all day! Until she laughed at the absurdity of it and they\u2019re sure they\u2019ve taken the edge off their mistake. \n\nThen they whip out the real cake. \n\nCuz this seems like the goal was to upset her, not surprise her or make her laugh.", "I mean if she broke down like that instantly they\u2019d surely also immediately bring out the second cake which there\u2019s no mention of", "Just like the old narrative \"he's hitting you because he has a crush on you!\" in elementary school... then 20 years later \"how could you stay in an abusive relationship? Why didn't you just leave?\"", "I can't believe it was decided E S H.\n\nThe roommate literally lied about what she cooked and said it was real bacon. The new roommate also didn't want to cover or help cover the hospital bills when it was brought up before lawyers were involved.", "Knock knock. Who's there? Not OP and her husband.", "Pranked her after she just got out of the hospital at her birthday party and you defend them? What the fuck are you smoking. YTA.", "Minimizing their behaviour *and* minimizing the daughter's response!", "It reminds me of that tiktok of a woman who clearly loves her 4? year old boy more than her 3 other daughters. She literally said \"he hit his sisters, but its okay; he had a rough day\"\n\nChilling", "Exactly. And if there was no second cake then they literally ruined the only cake she had", "times a billion. That poor kid. Imagine coming out of the hospital and someone ruins your birthday cake. You should have run out and gotten  another one making the boys pay for all birthday cakes for the next year.", "Wonder where they learned that from...", "It's normal because she's a terrible mother!", "Hahahaha! Empty PS5 game cases filled with mayonnaise!", "> AH in training\n\nI think they\u2019re fully licensed. They\u2019re all the asshole (maybe that\u2019s why you put YTA x3).", "Yeah maybe I\u2019m in the minority but if I ate a piece of the mayo cake first I would be so grossed out and unhappy I probably wouldn\u2019t want to eat a different cake, the enjoyment would be gone. And if she\u2019s already crying at that point what would a second cake do? The mood is ruined and awkward", "I can't believe the verdict was ESH.  Unbelievable.", "> you, a mother who has taught them to express love through acts of destruction and cruelty.\n\nThis right here. It\u2019s the whole BS trope of *\u201dBoys picking on girls they like\u201d*\n\nShe taught her boys that you abuse and bully the ones you love, and they\u2019re \u201cteaching\u201d the step-daughter. Generational abuse is not cute or okay at any age.\n\nOP is fully living up to the evil step mother stereotype. *\u201dMy two angels are perfect and should be adored since they can\u2019t do anything wrong. Recently hospitalized step-daughter simply is overly sensitive and needs to get over herself.\u201d* All thats missing is a fairy godmother and a pumpkin.", "It's because the perpetrators enjoyed it, so that's all that really matters. If someone else didn't they're just uptight or overly emotional. Because we live in a world in which an individual's fleeting happiness is considered more important than other people's mental and emotional well-being", "I mean it might be the answer but the solution is certainly not to just let boys just act like assholes because they aren't emotionally developed enough yet.", "That was my first thought. WTAF?", "Here!  Here!  I hate when someone pulls a prank and then just saying some trite phrase makes it ok.  It reminds me of a joke where a parent is going to severely beat their child over some minor infraction.  It\u2019s supposed to be ok because the parent says:  This is going to hurt me more than it\u2019s going to hurt you.", "No one wants that!\n\nYTA op. You\u2019re such an asshole that the next five posts on this sub will only be able to contain more YTA", "Not to mention if they did that and left the cake out for awhile it could have caused food poisoning.", "they could have gone with those candles that you have to constantly blow out, that would have been funny and wouldn't ruin the cake.", "It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t understand it, a preschooler understand that. It\u2019s that mean people can use \u201cpranks\u201d as a scapegoat for terrible behavior and when someone gets mad they can say \u201ccome on it\u2019s just a prank! :O\u201d", "Now that would be funny!", "Yeah, I totally agree.  It's not funny to prank a kid on her birthday and ruin it for her.  Mom and step-brothers owe her big time for this.  The poor girl just got out of the hospital ffs. OP's husband needs to put his foot down, demand they get punish, and ban pranks for good.", "Exactly!"]}
