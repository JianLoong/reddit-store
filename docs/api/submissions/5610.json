We got pregnant early on. Our parents were supportive because our families knew each other very well. I had taken up jobs to take care of my family after finishing studies. Lisa cheated on me with Bob and left me for him. She abandoned our daughter who was 16 at the time. I worked as a trucker for a few years that made Beth attached to Lisa. It was during that time her affair began. She was mad at Lisa for this but at the same time, she couldn't live without her. Lisa didn't want any custody arrangement except for visitation rights.\n\nI met my current wife Nick 3 years after my divorce. We hit it off and have been inseparable since. So Nick got pregnant and that was when my world started going downhill after divorce. Beth was furious. She called Nick names and all sorts of degrading stuff you can think of. It didn't come as a surprise because Lisa already had a kid with Bob. I firmly told Beth she needs to stop calling Nick names. I proposed Nick after 6 months of pregnancy. When we told Beth about it, she began throwing a tantrum about how I was breaking this family. I tried to talk to her but she threw a glass right at Nick. I saved Nick but it hit my hand. I asked Beth to leave. She went to Bob and Lisa and stayed there. This was about 9 years ago. We've been little contact with Beth from there. She never wanted to see me or Nick or our son, but she was completely free with Bob and Lisa. I wasn't even invited to her wedding just to give a view how apart we've drifted. Whenever I'd invite her for holidays, she'll turn me down.\n\nThis brings us to here: 4 days ago, Beth contacted me out of the blue. Her husband had been cheating on her and she's pregnant. He's kicking her out and filing for divorce and she needs a place to stay. This was the first time she, by herself, called me. I told her I don't think I can let her stay here with me. I need to ask my wife to see what she thinks of it. she began screaming at me that I was prioritizing my wife over her and that I was leaving her at her worst. I firmly reminded her that she left me in my worst period. She abandoned me. She was rude to my pregnant wife(Fianc\u00e9e at that time) She broke me and didn't even invite me to her wedding but invited Bob. She ended the call. I spoke to my wife and left her a text that though she can't stay here, I'll be happy to pay for a place for her to rent. she didn't want me to do anything and blocked me.\n\nTruthfully, I'm still angry at Beth that she never tried to apologize for how she treated me and Nick. I've talked to Nick and she isn't comfortable with Beth being around us. I can't have her because we have 2 kids, one a 2 year old. Lisa can't have her around as Bob is dead and Lisa works 2 jobs.

If she called and apologized for sure she could have stayed. \n\nHowever I will also add that you and her mom screwed up her life first. She was an emotional teen and her life was wrecked. Then you had another kid and she felt like she was unloved at that point (new baby was more important) so you do need to apologize to her for the way that would have made her feel if you haven\u2019t done so already.", "NTA but not an example to follow either.\nIf you were a better person you wouldn't be petty with your daughter and take the occasion to reconnect, but you decided to waste it.

Staying in your house is not the only way to support her - you ARE in fact stepping up as much as you can, even putting aside your own hurt and anger, and taking care of your estranged daughter and also not hurting your current family. \n\nYou\u2019re not only NTA - but you\u2019re a good dad.", ">Lisa can't have her around as Bob is dead and Lisa works 2 jobs. \n\n\nThat ... makes zero sense. What does any of that have to do with Beth staying there?", "She is horrible adult, she can look after herself.  Not your problem anymore", "YTA. Kids don't abandon parents; parents abandon kids. You were holding a kid responsible for being in a volatile and emotionally difficult situation and siding with her mom, who sounds manipulative as all get out. Now she's a grown adult and hitting rock bottom, and needs some help. I'm just a bit shocked you want to hold her accountable for something that happened 9 years ago and it really does sound like you chose your new wife over her when she was struggling to cope with the changes. Being around her mom, she was probably just parroting what she heard. \n\nMy guess is she wouldn't be asking to come back into your life if she wasn't desperate and needing a island for reprieve. You have the ability to potentially provide that for her and repair your relationship. Instead you tell her she probably can't come home and it's all up to your wife.\n\nFor reference, I had a difficult relationship with my parents in my early 20s; I ended up going through a severe mental health episode, was fired from my job, lived in extreme poverty, and finally sucked up my issues to ask my parents if I could move home for a while to get back on my feet. They said no. It would be disruptive to their home life. I then faced homelessness, starvation, and it took me much longer to pull myself out of that than if I had had a little bit of help. \n\nYears later, I still struggle with my resentment towards them, and they have backtracked and are now full of regret and guilt. Especially as their lives ended up crashing and burning, but I wasn't sure why I should give a crap when they watched my life crash and burn and did nothing.", "According to the Jewish traditions of Tzedakah, if you don't make sure your wife and children are fed and clothed and housed, then YATA.  This does not qualify you for TA role because you offered to pay for a place and they turned you down.\n\nWell I guess they made their choice, didn't they.  In order to make sure there are no future ramifications from this I would probably send $1000 in cash to your ex and tell her this is to provide some temporary relief to your joint daughter during this time, no need to account for it, just make her way a little smoother and hope all goes better for her.\n\nThen send a letter to the daughter a month later saying that you gave your ex $1000 to provide some cushion for her.", "NTA but don\u2019t be surprised if she go totally NC with you", "NTA. Working 2 jobs does not preclude Beth from staying w Lisa.", "Hard for Beth to walk back across burned bridges", "NTA. This is a sad situation all around and at least you offered to pay for an apartment. \n\nI do think you can reframe some of your daughter's behavior in terms of mental health. Her mom, your ex, sounds duplicitous and manipulative, and you certainly abandoned her for an important developmental period in her life- were you working? Sure. But to a child or a teen the absence is just felt as an absence. I am guessing she has had a difficult time knowing how to trust people and fears being abandoned., so her only coping mechanism is to act out. \n\nMental health is no excuse for bad behavior, esp. violence or berating people verbally, but I do hope your daughter gets help someday. It seems like she's learned to shut people off and act out as her only resources.", "I\u2019m sorry, this story makes no sense. So your wife cheats on you and leaves you for another man, but your daughter has no issue with that. When you decide to remarry a few years later and have a kid, your daughter is furious with you, even though your ex wife did the same thing. But she doesn\u2019t care that the ex wife was doing the same stuff? Am I reading this wrong or are you leaving out information?", "The final sentence makes no sense. \u201cLisa cant take in Beth because Bob died and Lisa works two jobs.\u201d So?

Beth can sleep on Lisa\u2019s couch or on a blow up mattress, what\u2019s the problem?\n\nRegardless OP is NTA.", "Your daughter assaulted your pregnant wife. She threw a glass at her. That's unforgivable in my book. It doesn't matter that you managed to catch it before it struck your wife, the intent to injure her was absolutely there.

At the assault of your wife and you i would have cut contact.", "NTA.\n\nWhy can\u2019t Lisa have her around while having two jobs? Isn\u2019t it for a short while? Isn\u2019t Beth a grown woman?

She's shown she's a danger to your wife and potentially your children, and has done nothing to prove otherwise. You offered to pay for a place for her to live, even though you've had no contact with her for 9 years by her choice. Instead of gratitude she gets angry. She's 29, not a child. It's sad that her husband cheated on her and kicked her out while she's pregnant, and even sadder that instead of some understanding of what you went thru with her mother, she's still angry with you. It makes me wonder what your ex said or did around her when you were working to create such engrained anger at you.", "NTA but understand you're probably going to permanently ruin any hope of a relationship with her.

ESH", "Nta", "Plus, if my math is right \"Beth\" was 20 and therefore an ADULT when she threw a glass at this pregnant woman.", "Well. Bob seems to have suddenly died lol. So... Beth can't be there.... It all makes sense.", "I agree. Beth is 29, she's a grown adult and not a child who needs constant supervision and care. Lisa can give her a key to her place and let her come and go as she pleases while she crashes on a couch and it wouldn't be a problem at all.", "According to the math of the post, Beth was TWENTY and an adult, when she threw a temper tantrum and threw a glass at a pregnant woman.", "It\u2019s a two bedroom apartment.

Lisa had visitation rights and Beth visited her whenever she wanted. I never stopped that. \n\nBeth can't stay with Lisa as Lisa is raising 4 kids on her own being a single mother living in a shitty apartment that simply isn't enough. She's working 2 jobs and barely surviving. If Beth goes there, it will only get harder for them\n\nI really don't know what happened for sure.

She is an adult who threw a temper tantrum the second he told her he had to talk to his wife first about her moving in. They have a bad relationship - it is reasonable to have her stay elsewhere, then maybe later they can work on their relationship. Her living there would be a horrible idea.", "He offered to rent out a place. Did you not read the thing? She's an active danger to his wife and kids. She was violent before the pregnancy and during it, her emotions may flare up even worse.

The safety of his family has to come first before the daughters feelings", "Lisa's husband died. She's living in a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 kids and working 2 jobs, so she has no room or money to help. Beth was a stay at home wife so she has no income.", "Why does she need to pay for her?", "All that means is that the sign no longer reads \"No vacancy\"", "Note also that she only reached out when she thought she could scam a place to stay out of it.  The moment you said no, bang NC again!", "The sad irony is that her husband is doing to her, what Lisa did to you. (Of course no need to mention this to her)\n\nAre you on speaking terms with Lisa? I would try one last time to reach out to her so maybe she can help see Beth what good of a deal you are offering her. It's much better for her to have a place of her own, than move in with a family she has no real relationship but animosity towards. She needs stability in her pregnancy, and frankly needs to prepare for life as a single mom. \n\nIf you're willing and its not too much financially for you, maybe tell Lisa that you can help Beth with an apartment for a year and a therapist. She will need help to go through her pregnancy, post partum and divorce transition. Someone who can also help her set her goals and work towards them.\n\nETA: once she's settled, you guys might try to rebuild a new relationship, and she might be mature enough now to see how even having half siblings near her future kid's age could be a total blessing. But for that to happen, therapy and smaller steps are the better way.", "Can her grandparents talk her into accepting your financial help?", "Was the invitation contingent on an apology as well?\n\nThis is complicated. I get the focus on the thrown glass and that Nick feels unsafe. But I worry that Beth has had a lot more than a glass thrown at her in recent times and needs  to have an advocate. A pregnant woman shouldn't be thrown out of her own home at Christmas, after finding that her husband has betrayed her. \n\nMaybe see her first, grab a coffee and talk. Get her to see the sense in having her own place close by, while her divorce goes through and  she gets herself on her own feet. She's possible needing moral support over financial.\n\nIn her panic she called you, can't apologies wait a few hours until you're togetheror do you want one over the phone?", "I call absolute bullshit.

It's not about an apology. How would you feel if a long lost friend contacts you out of the blue one day to demand you let him stay with you and your husband(I take it you're a lady) \n\nWe have a toddler. Her reaction that day and day that followed was NOT justified. I can forgive her verbal abuses but what about that glass that she threw at my wife. How am I supposed to take that?
