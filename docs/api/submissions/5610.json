We got pregnant early on. Our parents were supportive because our families knew each other very well. I had taken up jobs to take care of my family after finishing studies. Lisa cheated on me with Bob and left me for him. She abandoned our daughter who was 16 at the time. I worked as a trucker for a few years that made Beth attached to Lisa. It was during that time her affair began. She was mad at Lisa for this but at the same time, she couldn't live without her. Lisa didn't want any custody arrangement except for visitation rights.\n\nI met my current wife Nick 3 years after my divorce. We hit it off and have been inseparable since. So Nick got pregnant and that was when my world started going downhill after divorce. Beth was furious. She called Nick names and all sorts of degrading stuff you can think of. It didn't come as a surprise because Lisa already had a kid with Bob. I firmly told Beth she needs to stop calling Nick names. I proposed Nick after 6 months of pregnancy. When we told Beth about it, she began throwing a tantrum about how I was breaking this family. I tried to talk to her but she threw a glass right at Nick. I saved Nick but it hit my hand. I asked Beth to leave. She went to Bob and Lisa and stayed there. This was about 9 years ago. We've been little contact with Beth from there. She never wanted to see me or Nick or our son, but she was completely free with Bob and Lisa. I wasn't even invited to her wedding just to give a view how apart we've drifted. Whenever I'd invite her for holidays, she'll turn me down.\n\nThis brings us to here: 4 days ago, Beth contacted me out of the blue. Her husband had been cheating on her and she's pregnant. He's kicking her out and filing for divorce and she needs a place to stay. This was the first time she, by herself, called me. I told her I don't think I can let her stay here with me. I need to ask my wife to see what she thinks of it. she began screaming at me that I was prioritizing my wife over her and that I was leaving her at her worst. I firmly reminded her that she left me in my worst period. She abandoned me. She was rude to my pregnant wife(Fianc\u00e9e at that time) She broke me and didn't even invite me to her wedding but invited Bob. She ended the call. I spoke to my wife and left her a text that though she can't stay here, I'll be happy to pay for a place for her to rent. she didn't want me to do anything and blocked me.\n\nTruthfully, I'm still angry at Beth that she never tried to apologize for how she treated me and Nick. I've talked to Nick and she isn't comfortable with Beth being around us. I can't have her because we have 2 kids, one a 2 year old. Lisa can't have her around as Bob is dead and Lisa works 2 jobs.

If she called and apologized for sure she could have stayed. \n\nHowever I will also add that you and her mom screwed up her life first. She was an emotional teen and her life was wrecked. Then you had another kid and she felt like she was unloved at that point (new baby was more important) so you do need to apologize to her for the way that would have made her feel if you haven\u2019t done so already.", "NTA but not an example to follow either.\nIf you were a better person you wouldn't be petty with your daughter and take the occasion to reconnect, but you decided to waste it.
