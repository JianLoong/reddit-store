My brother went into a deep depression, rarely leaving the house and began to neglect their two girls. He refused to get help, and eventually quit his job and began living on their savings.\n\nOnce the money dried up, me and my wife began providing loans to him, which he never paid back. He eventually sold his house and moved in with us, while he looked for the right place. He never found that right place and from February last year until 2 weeks ago, he lived with us.\n\nHe never got a job and didn't pay rent. He would spend most of his days at bars and developed a drinking problem. I tried to stage an intervention with family but to no avail.\n\nHis girls suffered the most throughout all of this. I love his girls and consider them like my own. So when we discovered that their tuition wasn\u2019t being paid, I immediately confronted him. He put on a sob story about money woes and how everything has been so hard since his wife died. I knew this was bs. He made a crap-ton on that house and spent nothing. I was pissed, but my wife was more sympathetic and convinced me to pay for them.\n\nNow we were paying for ourselves, him, our 4 kids and his girls. My brother was still dodging work, so my wife quit being a stay-at-home mom and got a job. She expected my brother to take over the household, but eventually we had to teach the kids to take over my wife's duties.\n\nI tolerated all of his bs, until this Valentines Day. My wife and I have a jar, where we throw in loose change or bills to save up for a trip for us two. Before this, my wife had put two $50 bills in the jar. We both took the day off and while I was at the store getting flowers, she texted me telling me the cash was gone. She said it wasn\u2019t the kids since it was still there when they left for school. I called my brother, who didn\u2019t answer, so I came home.\n\nHe wasn't home so my wife and I waited until he came home at around 7. I asked the kids (who had all denied it) to go upstairs. I asked him about the $100. He didn't lie and said something like; \"Oh, I thought it was the family change box. Yeah. I didn't have cash so I took it.\" I told him to pay it back, but he said he needed it more.\n\nI had reached my breaking point. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I went off, calling him a freeloader, a bludger and other things. He broke down and began mumbling about his wife. This was always his excuse. Get a job? My wife is dead. Help out around the house? My wife is dead. Stop drinking? My wife is dead.\n\nI told him that it doesn't mean he gets to be a freeloader and mooch off us. He said something like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d and left. I didn\u2019t follow him\n\nThe next day, he had left with the girls to his in-laws. My kids, who heard it all, said I was in the wrong. My wife even said I was too harsh. While I regret \u00bd of the things I said, I just grew so sick of him that I feel I gave him a much needed wakeup call.

He isn't a man really he doesn't take care of his children so yeah NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe refused to improve himself, neglected his own children, essentially cornered you into a position where you had to look after them, leached off of you and your money while refusing to get a job AND stole money from you?\n\nHis dead wife isn't an excuse for all of that.

He does need the wakeup call, but it definitely should have been handled better, but I'll let you off the hook for that one.\n\nHe's grieving, but he's also using it to just hide away from the world and lock himself in a grief loop. He will avoid everything because his wife is dead.\n\nHe doesn't need to be fully moved on but he does need to make steps forward no matter the reluctance. If not for himself then for his kids, who lost a mother. He lost a wife but for as long as he avoids reality they have lost both parents.\n\nHe will probably do the same thing at the in-laws, and that is going to have a worse meltdown than what happened at yours. Why? Because he will be the son-in-law mooching off a couple that lost their daughter.\n\nAlso thinking a money jar with two 50's in it is a household spare change jar is just absurd. And even if it was, who the hell just takes money from another family's change jar", "NTA not sure where you live but maybe you can get custody of the girls?", "NTA, take him to small claims for the money he owes you.", "This is a tough one. On one hand, two years isn't a great deal of time in terms of grief. On the other, you have been incredibly supportive over those two years, and he's had longer than most grieving people have to get to grips with living again. You can't be expected to keep up this level of support indefinitely. I'm most sorry for his daughters.\n\nIn an ideal world you'd have sat him down and had a discussion calmly once you started to feel this resentment, rather than allowing it to fester and then reach a flash point. However, hindsight is 20:20.\n\nOverall NAH. Maybe leave it for a bit and then apologise for being so blunt.

You have a valid reason to be upset with him but you have not handled this well. You let an intolerable situation go on and on until you couldn't handle it anymore and exploded in a cruel way. Healthy compassion is where you say \"Hey buddy I know you've been suffering and I'm really sorry. But now's the time to pull yourself together for the sake of your family and keep on living. Let us help you do that.\" It is not where you bottle this up inside for a long time while you watch someone decline and then explode.\n\nAt the same time he needs to get his shit together. I've been through horrific grief myself so I'm understanding of what he's going through. But one of the hardest and most necessary parts of the grieving process is coming to the realization that life goes on whether you want it to or not. The bills still need to get paid, dog still needs to be fed, kids still need their needs met. Collapsing into dysfunction has consequences. \n\nSo he needs to pull it together, and you need to meet this situation with compassion and healthy boundaries.", "ESH", "YTA for the delivery, but you\u2019re also correct to call him out. \n\nIf his wife could see him now, would she be okay with it? Is this how he\u2019s going to honor what they built together before she died? \n\nHe needs to go to therapy. Badly. He\u2019s also TA if he refuses to get any sort of help. There\u2019s no excuse for that.", "YTA but He's an even bigger one. He's in his rock bottom and you just encouraged him to stay there with your loans, while he doesnt actually fix himself, yk what you have to do instead? Tell him to work out, It always works, at least with guys, so tell him to work out and get a job, make sure he actually works out even maybe hire someone to help him. This might seem outlandish but It helps with self esteem a lot. Worst thing that can happen is that he becomes a tate fan, but id argue thats much better than being an alcoholic leech. Sadly you cant change the past so now hes a useless old slob that steals from his own family, because you encouraged that behaviour.", "NTA, \n\nLosing a love one is never ever easy. Having said that, life goes on, as harsh as it is, it\u2019s reality plus in this case he has children and providing for them needs to be his top priority. Though you prbly were harsh, it\u2019s deserved. There\u2019s only so much help you can give someone, if that person doesn\u2019t want to help themselves or don\u2019t show signs of improving then cutting off support is the best. \n\nI would also add to keep tabs on his children, they don\u2019t deserve to suffer for their fathers mistakes.", "NTA\n\nYour brother needs a therapist.", "NTA he needs to get his shit together for his kids. you need to stop supporting him any further than helping the kids if absolutely necessary", "NTA. Grief and depression are real problems, and they don't have a set timeline. That being said, your brother wasn't just a husband, he's also a parent. He owes it to his late wife, and his children, to get his shit together and start *parenting*. That means putting their needs ahead of his desire to self medicate. Therapy, grief support groups, antidepressants... He needs to be taking steps to heal so her can be a father to his children instead of relying on everyone else to take care of him.", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t working, helping around the house or taking care of his children in your house. He was drinking and stealing. To continue that wouldn\u2019t help anyone. Now his in-laws can take care of the girls and he can get his shit together or not, but it wasn\u2019t working at your house. \n\nIf something isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s asinine to think it will work if you keep doing it.", "NTA, jewelry and electronics was next. Make sure he hasn't already sold any gaming systems you don't have out in the open. This was going to end badly, don't be afraid to say that you bout your family above his drinking and reckless finances.", "NTA - I feel like your brother needs a healthy dose of reality and to wake up before he loses the rest of his family.\nI feel for him that he lost his wife but I\u2019m sure his wife is pissed at him for neglecting their kids and drinking what was once their future away.", "NTA.\n\n\nShit happens you have to move on.", "NTA", "This.", "I don't think that is necessary for the time being. He and the girls are with his late-wife's parents, so I know they are in good hands. But thank you for the advice regardless.", "Its gonna be so much worse now that he's at the in-laws place. Mooching off the people who lost their daughter", "This too.", "Why didn't he just go there earlier if things were tense? I mean, I'd want to be around my brother for sure. Also, I guess the kids would like to be with their cousins, but still.\n\nAlso what do your parents have to say about this. Kinda surprised there's no mention of them in your post, nor the fact that your brother didn't go to them?", "[deleted]", "But the girls will have their grandparents while he\u2019s off drinking and that\u2019s a good thing.", "Never is an acceptable answer.  How long would it take to be able to be a functioning adult when you have two kids to raise is a more appropriate question.\n\nYes, he lost his wife. Yes, that is tremendously hard.  However, that's not a free pass to behave like that.  It should not be an excuse to be a drunk, go broke, neglect your kids, steal, give up on life.", "A life time, but I\u2019m not going to drink all day while my children languish.", "I meant the eventual meltdown between the dad and the in-laws. The kids having grandparents there for them is 100% a positive, and they'll probably push to keep them once the mooching meltdown happens again", "And honestly grandparents have a better chance of getting custodial rights, especially as they are the deceased mother's kin. So, when he screws up, the state can grant them some legal ability to be there for them.", "I hope they kick him to the curb and keep the girls. It might be the wakeup call he needs.", "If I were the grandparents I\u2019d give him 30 days to get a job or get out and keep the girls.", "He definitely needs to hit rock bottom, and is hovering just above", "Yup. And make sure call the cops if he ever tried to drive drunk or such. He's desperately in search of his bottom."]}
