At some point a big german shepherd came tearing towards us, flipped my dog and held him down, and started snarling and barking in his face. My dog was screaming (he's a breed of dog that yells more than barks) and obviously terrified. A moment or two later the dog's owners come running after him and arrive on the scene.

He deserved it for being a puppy? He was asking for it? Put your dog on a leash.\" (I probably peppered that with curses, but maybe not, I don't usually curse.

Shouting fuck off doesn\u2019t sound too bad OP I wouldn\u2019t worry urself, especially with the trauma of ur dog as a puppy:(", "NTA \nHe\u2019ll be sorry if his dog runs up to the wrong dog one day and get attacked", "NTA at all, you can say all you want that your dog does well off the leash, but the reality is that you don\u2019t know other dogs or how other dogs might react, like it this case, this could have ended badly", "NTA. Always advocate for your dog. Unfortunately you can\u2019t train humans to act they way they should\u2026..", "Start carrying pepper spray. Lots of entitled assholes out there", "Dude I've had the same thing happen with ym Dog where someone had their front door open and let their Dog have free reign. Almost kicked the dog in the jaw when it rushed towards my dog, and I look like the asshole to owners, but idc it's my job to protect my dog not someone elses. You were in the same boat. Let his dog fuck around and he can pay for a new hip bone.", "Something similar also happened with me once so now i always carry a big stick with me to scare off any dogs and it generally works most of the time", "NTA- nope not one bit I have a small dog too and I can not stand people that allow their dogs to do this shit I\u2019ve had some scary situations with off leash dogs people always think no not my dog like if they don\u2019t have proper training and if they do have it they still can act out of character I always have a firm grip on my dog because of shit like this I\u2019m sorry you and your dog had to go through that", "Yeah, no. NTA\nThat dog did not want to say hello.  Nor did it want to play. \nNext time, if the dog does not move away when you approach it, throw something in front of the dog,  like an empty plastic bottle.  Or take a stick and tap it on the ground in front of you while shouting at the dog.  \nOr, shout very loudly that your dog has fleas, diarrhea etc.", "NTA.  If anything, I'd have said far worse.  You were protecting your dog, period.  His dog was clearly in the wrong, and he sounds like a terrible dog owner.", "It's not even that.  There is a dog in my neighborhood, when he was a puppy he was great friends with my dog.  Around 9 months, suddenly my dog was the great enemy. The other dog's owner kept saying we need to do play dates, so they can learn again how to be friends, though everyone else who saw the dogs interact agreed that his dog *really* disliked mine, and would pull whoever had his lead off their feet in attempts to attack my dog, and if a play date were to occur, to make sure the other dog was fully muzzled.  The other owner kept talking like it was all fine and dandy, and what a good dog he had, even saying that to make sure his dog was a good dog, he'd spent thousands of dollars with a specialized trainer.\n\n\nThe point that it made it real, and really scary for me, was one day we were walking past the dog sitter's house, while the dog was in the back yard; the dog jumped the 4.5' fence to try to get to my dog; luckily, I was able to interpose myself until the dogsitter ran out and retrieved the dog, apologizing profusely the entire time.  The next week, they had a 6' opqaue fence around the entire back yard.\n\n\nA little while later, one warm summer evening, I was walking my dog with my headphones on.  I was aware that the other dog was being walked in the neighborhood, but as he was always like a block or so away, and made turns onto streets where I could see, I wasn't terribly concerned.  But about 1 house from an intersection, my dog had to do his business, I was watching my dog, when suddenly I see him tense up: the other dog was coming up behind him, off lead (well, dragging his lead).  I again interposed myself, and yelled at the owner, who just said, as he wandered over to where we were \"Oh, look, I think [his dog] just wants to be friends\", then got his dog's lead and continued on his walk, like nothing happened.\n\n\nSo, sometimes, even when you do know the dog, and even more so *especially* when you know the dog, seeing one off lead, coming towards yours, can be pretty scary.\n\n\n(FWIW, both my dog and the other dog are 'large breed' dogs, 100#+, though the other dog is like 50% bigger than mine. both bred as *serious* hunting / guarding dogs, though mine seems to have none of those instincts)", "NTA\nThat owner was wrong on SO many levels. Dogs say hello by sniffing butts, not snarling at each other. Plus, dogs should never be off leash in public \u2014 for their safety, the owner\u2019s safety, and everyone else\u2019s safety.", "OP is UK based, where the off-lead etiquette is totally different to the US. Dog parks don\u2019t really exist, and a majority of dogs in parks and the fields in the countryside are walked off-lead. \n\nHowever, OP is still absolutely NTA as it is common knowledge that off-lead dogs have to have good recall (super important for lurchers \nas they have a high prey drive) and should not be allowed to approach an on-lead dog without active verbal assent from its owner. The lurchers\u2019 owner should have recalled his dog immediately and not allowed it to run up and bark at OP\u2019s dog at all.", "Scary is right. Once while walking my dog we were charged by a big hound-looking dog who was presumably in his yard, never saw the owner, and another time we were VERY SLOWLY stalked by a Rottweiler that came out of his yard and started following behind us (again, owner wasn't around). Frankly, the slow movement was way scarier than the charging dog. \n\nFortunately, I have a really deep voice and in both cases, very loudly and sternly said \"NO\" to them, which caused them both to back off. OP is definitely not the AH for telling another dog to get away from her dog when that dog is clearly being aggressive\n\nAlso, pretty sure the dog doesn't understand curse words, so he wasn't bothered by being told to 'f\\*ck off.' And since the other guy was definitely the AH, it doesn't matter if he was offended or not.", "NTA\nThe guy's angry response is very typical of a person who knows full well they have no idea what they're doing and can't justify their position. You were well within your right to chastise him for having an out of control dog and he has no business owning them if he cannot even respect that not all dogs want to be interacted with.", "Ngl, the second that dog didn\u2019t back off I would have been swatting at it with a stick.", "They don't want to just say hi - they are coming to assess your threat factor.  That's why I don't trust off-lead dogs, especially when the owners call for them but they don't listen.", "I\u2019m stealing this idea.", "sighthound crossed with anything else. often bred for racing or hunting and then chucked away if they're no use at it, so show up in rescues a lot", "This is not normal behavior for a supposed friendly dog. The dog was circling and snarling at the other dog, which sounds aggressive to me. If the dog had run up and was just trying to get a sniff in, I might be more understanding, but that dog was not trying to say hi. Not the way a normal dog does.", "my parents live in a tiny place and everyone walks their dogs in the field by their house. they bump into people when walking their dog more often than not", "I really hate people that lie about their dogs and / or ignore your boundaries with your animals. I've got 2 reactive dogs and always inform people that they're scared / nervous around new people so don't approach them until they're ready. Instead of listening I've had to physically pick them up (35 & 55lbs) and carry them inside when people don't want to listen because they're cute \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd Like I'm working on their issues the best I can and you think petting them or trying to shove your dog in their faces is going to help? I get that they're adorable but 1 has trauma and the other was a plague puppy that thinks people are trying to eat her if they get too close, please stop stressing them out \ud83d\ude2d", "Every time. We had one break off his leash to rush at our leashed dog. Knocked over my 3 year old in the process. Another time, I nearly crashed my bike when an unleashed dog ran in front of me on a bike trail. While, I\u2019ve seen some remarkably well-trained dogs off leash that don\u2019t cause a problem, every time I\u2019ve had an issue with an unleashed dog, the stupid owner was excusing the behavior the whole time, \u201che doesn\u2019t bite\u201d, or \u201che\u2019s just friendly.\u201d Leash your damn dogs, y\u2019all.", "[removed]", "That actually explains something I had been seeing in a documentary based in England.  It was about the canal system, and there were plenty of shots of people with dogs.  And not a single one was leashed.\n\nI know not everywhere is the same as the US.  But for some reason I was under the impression that the UK was stricter about leashes than we are.  I don't know why.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. If your dog can\u2019t recall, keep it on private property or leash it.", "Fuck that person.  They should be reported and fined", "Meh, it's whatever. Clearly, the people have spoken and think that your response was just-right. In my mind, you both shirked your \"duty of care\" and therefore, ESH. It's like no one here has had to deal with the normal reactions of dogs before. I mean, don't get me wrong...my pup is my world. He has also been attacked by an ill-mannered dog. You know what we do? We avoid the dog. At the dog park, if there's a tussle beyond normal play and getting-to-know-you, we take our boy and leave. He's well-adjusted, social, knows how to play and, at the same time, doesn't hesitate to \"correct\" other dogs from behaviors he doesn't like.\n\nNever once have I raised my voice to another person's dog OR another dog owner. It's just unnecessary.\n\nBut congrats on your AITA win. I'm sure your dog is positively glowing in the light of your righteousness.", "Wasn't there. Can't say how it played out. The dog might have started circling because OP was yelling at the owner and taking an aggressive stance. OP should have picked up the dog and left the area, particularly because an untethered dog can be a threat when being presented with aggression.", "I hope you still leash your dog in unfamiliar areas, or when they're around other dogs they don't know for everyone's safety. Leash laws exist for a very, very good reason.", "Picking up a dog can actually lead to more aggression because the other dog might see it as a game. They might try jumping and lunging to try and get at the dog. In this case, best idea is to stand your ground while the owner takes control of their dog. Which should have happened immediately and with an apology.", "If you say so, Friend. The \"victim dog\" here is a mini-weinercock. Pretty sure extracting the \"victim\" from this equation would have been best. \n\nNot really my horse race, so my give-a-shit on this subject has expired. Be well.", "What an absolutely odd thing to not be able to comprehend. OP literally had to get his dog surgery because of an offleash dog, and you can't understand why he got angry and scared about another offleash dog being aggressive?"]}
