Very traumatic for us both and consequently, I\u2019m very protective of him.

I kept saying \u201cNO\u201dand the lurcher then ran away and back to us, barking each time. He kept doing this, while I was trying to calm my dog and hold him on a short lead. The owner made no attempt to retrieve the dog, and the 5th time it ran back barking at us I shouted \u201cF*CK OFF\u201d.

I told the man that my dog was attacked as a puppy and that his dog was scaring mine. The guy laughed and said \u201cwhatever, don\u2019t take it out on my dog\u201d\n\nI said that if he couldn\u2019t control his dog it shouldn\u2019t be off lead, that he clearly had no recall and that his dog shouldn\u2019t be allowed to come up to an on lead dog and frighten it. I reiterated that my dog was attacked as a puppy which caused a broken leg. \n\nThe guy\u2019s response was that \u201cf*ck off, this is what dogs do\u201d and that his dog just wanted to \u201csay hello\u201d.  I said again that he had no control and it shouldn\u2019t be off lead. \n\nHe called me a f*cking idiot, I replied that he was a c*nt and then he left. \n\nThis was all in the heat of the moment and, having calmed down, I regret the language I used but I\u2019m absolutely furious at the situation that occurred. \n\nSo, AITA for shouting at a stranger\u2019s dog?", "created_utc": 1675258707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10quxp1/aita_for_shouting_at_a_strangers_dog/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At some point a big german shepherd came tearing towards us, flipped my dog and held him down, and started snarling and barking in his face. My dog was screaming (he's a breed of dog that yells more than barks) and obviously terrified. A moment or two later the dog's owners come running after him and arrive on the scene. I'm yelling at this dog to get off of mine and finally I have to step in there and grab it by the collar and yank him off so I can free my puppy. I'm literally holding this big german shepherd half in the air by the collar (not a safe situation for me either!) and had to yell at the owners to get their damn dog under control. Finally they snap out of their trance and take him.\n\nI yelled at them at that point, saying this is not an area where dogs are allowed off leash. They try to say \"but he's so well trained,\" and I yell at them and say he's obviously not well trained if he attacked my dog.\" Then one of them says, \"it's because your dog is a puppy,\" and I yelled and said, \"So it's my dog's fault that your dog attacked him? He deserved it for being a puppy? He was asking for it? Put your dog on a leash.\" (I probably peppered that with curses, but maybe not, I don't usually curse. But they were still pretty stunned.)\n\nAnyway, that's not really an answer to your question, I just wanted to say I understand!\n\nI also truly truly understand the desire to let a dog off leash, especially when hiking in the mountains! You are out there with your dog, climbing hills and scrambling over rocks, it feels like no one's around for miles, you are enjoying nature and life, and you want your dog to be as happy and free as possible.
