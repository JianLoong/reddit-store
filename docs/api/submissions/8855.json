The lab bit through his thigh bone which shattered into 5 pieces, resulting in surgery to put in a metal plate and 3 months of crate rest to ensure the bone healed. Very traumatic for us both and consequently, I\u2019m very protective of him. He also has poor recall so is never off lead himself. \n\nToday on our walk in a field near my house we saw a man with two lurchers. One off lead and one on lead. \n\nThe off lead lurcher ran over to us and started barking in my dog\u2019s face. My dog clearly didn\u2019t appreciate this and snarled and barked back. The owner of the lurcher called it back but the lurcher ignored its owner and continued to circle us, barking at my dog. I kept saying \u201cNO\u201dand the lurcher then ran away and back to us, barking each time. He kept doing this, while I was trying to calm my dog and hold him on a short lead. The owner made no attempt to retrieve the dog, and the 5th time it ran back barking at us I shouted \u201cF*CK OFF\u201d. A more appropriate choice of words might have been \u201cGo away\u201d, but we live and learn\u2026\n\nThe owner then retrieved his dog, and told me he just wanted to say hello and that I shouldn\u2019t \u201ctake it out on\u201d his dog. \n\nAt this point I had completely lost composure, having tried to control my dog for about 2-3 minutes while both dogs were barking and snarling. I told the man that my dog was attacked as a puppy and that his dog was scaring mine. The guy laughed and said \u201cwhatever, don\u2019t take it out on my dog\u201d\n\nI said that if he couldn\u2019t control his dog it shouldn\u2019t be off lead, that he clearly had no recall and that his dog shouldn\u2019t be allowed to come up to an on lead dog and frighten it. I reiterated that my dog was attacked as a puppy which caused a broken leg. \n\nThe guy\u2019s response was that \u201cf*ck off, this is what dogs do\u201d and that his dog just wanted to \u201csay hello\u201d.  I said again that he had no control and it shouldn\u2019t be off lead. \n\nHe called me a f*cking idiot, I replied that he was a c*nt and then he left. \n\nThis was all in the heat of the moment and, having calmed down, I regret the language I used but I\u2019m absolutely furious at the situation that occurred. \n\nSo, AITA for shouting at a stranger\u2019s dog?", "created_utc": 1675258707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10quxp1/aita_for_shouting_at_a_strangers_dog/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The dog should have been on a leash.", "NTA.\n\n1. Even if someone's dog is friendly other dog owners don't know that. They need to approach cautiously and with owner approval.\n2.

But if I ever have them off leash in a place that is public but not a dog park primarily intended for off leash dogs, if other dogs show up that I don't know I immediately leash up my dogs. I keep them on leash until there's a mutual acknowledgement between me and the other owners that our dogs can interact, and if the other owner even gives the slightest hesitation that they are uncomfortable with it I keep my dogs on leash. \n\nThe rule should be opt-in not opt-out.

The lurcher should have been on-leash. That said, the dog *did* act normally for a dog. You didn't act normally for a person.

May have been the stress of the situation but I clearly told him if he didnt get his dogs under control fucking now our touched our dog he'd have to deal with me.   \n\n\nNo one fucks with my dog :D", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to your dog", "You may be right with this, but my experience has been shouting at the dog as it comes up more times than not gets the dog to fuck off before it becomes an issue, and since our dog (on leash at the time) has been attacked but multiple off leash dogs, I dont take the chance.", "Responding to my own comment to share a story: When my dog was still a puppy (\\~12 months?) we were hiking in the mountains and he was on leash (as required by the rules of those particular hiking trails). At some point a big german shepherd came tearing towards us, flipped my dog and held him down, and started snarling and barking in his face. My dog was screaming (he's a breed of dog that yells more than barks) and obviously terrified. A moment or two later the dog's owners come running after him and arrive on the scene. I'm yelling at this dog to get off of mine and finally I have to step in there and grab it by the collar and yank him off so I can free my puppy. I'm literally holding this big german shepherd half in the air by the collar (not a safe situation for me either!) and had to yell at the owners to get their damn dog under control. Finally they snap out of their trance and take him.\n\nI yelled at them at that point, saying this is not an area where dogs are allowed off leash. They try to say \"but he's so well trained,\" and I yell at them and say he's obviously not well trained if he attacked my dog.\" Then one of them says, \"it's because your dog is a puppy,\" and I yelled and said, \"So it's my dog's fault that your dog attacked him? He deserved it for being a puppy? He was asking for it? Put your dog on a leash.\" (I probably peppered that with curses, but maybe not, I don't usually curse. But they were still pretty stunned.)\n\nAnyway, that's not really an answer to your question, I just wanted to say I understand!\n\nI also truly truly understand the desire to let a dog off leash, especially when hiking in the mountains! You are out there with your dog, climbing hills and scrambling over rocks, it feels like no one's around for miles, you are enjoying nature and life, and you want your dog to be as happy and free as possible. Except other people are around! And if your dog is going to attack puppies on sight, that's a you problem and not a me problem.", "Apparently it's a crossbreed dog, like all the poodle halfbreeds.\n\"Lurchers are usually a cross between a sighthound breed \u2013 such as Greyhound, Saluki or Whippet \u2013 and a Collie or Terrier.\"", "I agree that I shouldn\u2019t have sworn. I do swear too much in general, and so under pressure I\u2019m a lot less able to filter bad words out and think of a more appropriate response.", "Some people\u2019s justifications really are ridiculous hahaha"]}
