At some point a big german shepherd came tearing towards us, flipped my dog and held him down, and started snarling and barking in his face. My dog was screaming (he's a breed of dog that yells more than barks) and obviously terrified. A moment or two later the dog's owners come running after him and arrive on the scene.

He deserved it for being a puppy? He was asking for it? Put your dog on a leash.\" (I probably peppered that with curses, but maybe not, I don't usually curse.

When I first got her, she was terrified of other dogs, no matter what size.  I was out walking her one day, on lead, of course, when another little dog ran up towards us, full bore.  I really believe the other dog just wanted to be friends, but I could see my dog was already tense.

There is a dog in my neighborhood, when he was a puppy he was great friends with my dog.  Around 9 months, suddenly my dog was the great enemy. The other dog's owner kept saying we need to do play dates, so they can learn again how to be friends, though everyone else who saw the dogs interact agreed that his dog *really* disliked mine, and would pull whoever had his lead off their feet in attempts to attack my dog, and if a play date were to occur, to make sure the other dog was fully muzzled.  The other owner kept talking like it was all fine and dandy, and what a good dog he had, even saying that to make sure his dog was a good dog, he'd spent thousands of dollars with a specialized trainer.\n\n\nThe point that it made it real, and really scary for me, was one day we were walking past the dog sitter's house, while the dog was in the back yard; the dog jumped the 4.5' fence to try to get to my dog; luckily, I was able to interpose myself until the dogsitter ran out and retrieved the dog, apologizing profusely the entire time.  The next week, they had a 6' opqaue fence around the entire back yard.\n\n\nA little while later, one warm summer evening, I was walking my dog with my headphones on.  I was aware that the other dog was being walked in the neighborhood, but as he was always like a block or so away, and made turns onto streets where I could see, I wasn't terribly concerned.  But about 1 house from an intersection, my dog had to do his business, I was watching my dog, when suddenly I see him tense up: the other dog was coming up behind him, off lead (well, dragging his lead).  I again interposed myself, and yelled at the owner, who just said, as he wandered over to where we were \"Oh, look, I think [his dog] just wants to be friends\", then got his dog's lead and continued on his walk, like nothing happened.\n\n\nSo, sometimes, even when you do know the dog, and even more so *especially* when you know the dog, seeing one off lead, coming towards yours, can be pretty scary.\n\n\n(FWIW, both my dog and the other dog are 'large breed' dogs, 100#+, though the other dog is like 50% bigger than mine. both bred as *serious* hunting / guarding dogs, though mine seems to have none of those instincts)", "[removed]", "OP is UK based, where the off-lead etiquette is totally different to the US.
