She also needs a separate alarm clock. This is 100% her responsibility, but as her partner, if you happen to see the screen on when she\u2019s sleeping I\u2019d turn it off and check that it\u2019s plugged in just as a kindness.

Why not get her a charger to keep by the bed?", "NTA\n\nIts not your responsibility to make sure she gets to work on time. There are plenty of other measures she can take to ensure her alarm will go off. You shoud not have to manage her life for her. \n\nFYI - this *does* show where her priorities lie. Being in good standing at her job, and maintining job security is not a priority for her. If it was, then she would take extra measures to ensure it never happened again.", "NTA. At the end of the day you are her partner not her parent and its not your job to ensure she gets herself up for work. Could you have gone and made sure it was plugged in and alarms were set? Yeah sure be nice, but you're not an asshole for not doing it, no way. She's an adult who should be able to manage these most basic of taks and should have learned her lesson by now from the sounds of it.", "NTA. How many times has she been late because her phone died, and she still hasn't thought or bothered to get an alarm clock?!? Maybe she shouldn't be a teacher ...", "NTA\n\nShe is a fucking adulte, she need to take her responsability herself.", "NTA, it isn't your responsibility to sort out alarms for her. And the phone screen should have timed out after a couple minutes anyways, so I don't even see that I would have expected that to be an issue.\n\nShe really should be investing in a secondary alarm clock, though, if her phone dieing a lot is a problem.", "NTA\n\nYou need to let this lady fail and let life teach her some lessons. She is clearly stubborn as she\u2019s already lost a recommendation from it (which is a big deal in edu) and maybe even a job.", "NTA. She needs to manage her own waking up process. An adult shouldn\u2019t be depending on someone else for something as simple as getting up on time.", "NTA\n\nShe is an adult and clearly needs to step up and take control of this part of her life.

You can schedule them to go off on certain days on repeat.", "NTA but buy her a non-phone alarm clock and fix the problem if you don't want it to happen again.

She\u2019s an adult (or should be at least), it\u2019s her responsibility to ensure she wakes up on time.\n\nAt some point she\u2019s going to have to grow up and take care of herself. There\u2019s no reason she should be consistently forgetting to set an alarm, and she definitely has no excuse for letting her phone die overnight if there\u2019s a charger available.\n\nI say this as someone with ADHD who has struggled with tardiness in the past.

She\u2019s gotta be able to stand on her own two feet and remember to do simple things like charge her phone and set alarms. Really there is no excuse for the alarms thing.

If she struggles with organising herself elsewhere or doing the chores etc I would consider an executive function disorder. This sounds more than laziness and won't be resolved just by another alarm clock", "NTA though I will ask, was the phone plugged in? Like is she really being that irresponsible with getting up on time? It\u2019s definitely not you job or obligation to make sure she is on time. If she is watching videos on her phone without plugging it in while in bed, she\u2019s got way more executive functions issues she\u2019s needs to work on", "I agree on the screen off timer, I\u2019m gonna tinker with her settings when she gets home because I\u2019m truly baffled at how our bedsheets keep her phone on. I don\u2019t think she expects it from me at all, but I do feel like a complete AH for not turning it off when I saw it was on. I didn\u2019t have her back and wasn\u2019t being a partner to her, but I also really did think it was getting charged or would turn off soon", "She has one, she just didn\u2019t use it.

It\u2019s probably why did didn\u2019t plug it in in the first place", "2-3, but only once at her current job. We have other alarm clock options idrk why she keeps opting for her phone and only her phone. Maybe she\u2019s just used to it", "I totally agree with the phone timing out, I truly don\u2019t know how she does it. Literally kept on by the bed sheets. I gave her my old phone when I last upgraded so I know for sure that it isn\u2019t the phone as much as whatever she does with it", "Mine and Google, idk why she doesn\u2019t use the latter.

That's what I meant", "No offense, but thats ridiculous.\n\nAre you trying to say she doesn't know how to set an alarm? Or that she doesn't know how to plug her phone into a charger?\n\nIts like if someone is severely overweight. And they say \"i dont know how to lose weight\". Well, thats a lie. Eat less and move more. Its not complicated. I'm not saying its *easy* to execute. Its definitely *not* easy. But saying \"i don't know how\" is ridiculous. Its called 'playing dumb'. \n\nWhen someone says \"i dont know how\" for something like this, what they are actually saying is \"its too hard, and I don't actually want to put extra effort in\".", "From what little I know it doesn't sound like her heart is in this job at all, she's already lost a recommendation, if she cared at all she'd kick herself up the arse and try to improve and earn that back. You shouldn't be feeling bad, you made every effort to help her. She is an adult who should be getting herself up for work whether her heart is in it or not. And if she wasn't feeling well she should be ringing up the evening before or getting up early enough that she can ring with plenty notice then. If this was a parent talking about getting his child up for school then sure, maybe you're an asshole. But nah dude you can feel free from any guilt.", "[deleted]", "Unfortunately there was no magic cure. I got tired of the anxiety of running late and the fear of getting in trouble so I essentially forced myself to create a routine. \n\nEvery night I set my alarms and ensure my phone is charged. It\u2019s not great for the battery, but if it\u2019s under 40-50% I\u2019ll put it on the charger. Not losing my job is more important than the longevity of my battery lol\n\nI will say that it helps that my husband sets his alarms every night, bc if I\u2019m having a particularly off day it will remind me to do it too.\n\nAlso, I set an alarm for 15 minutes before I need to leave the house just in case I get distracted or lose track of time. That has been *immensely* helpful.", "Not at all. You are taking on more responsibility for her than is yours to take and that will eat you up in the long run. It is difficult to set boundaries with someone with executive function disorder/ADHD as they will never stop needing your help. Ever. Eventually your tap will run dry. Ongoing adult conversations with her about how you can work together will help, but you have to figure out where your boundaries are, how much you can offer in time and mental effort to help and what is and isn't your responsibility", "Don\u2019t feel bad.

I just don\u2019t think she\u2019s used to the full time job life, she\u2019s barely out of college and she spent most of that online instead of going to physically classes, on top of that dealing with a lot of MH stuff - I\u2019m not surprised there wasn\u2019t more room in her head.

There are only so many times she\u2019ll be off the hook", "Yes OP you care but taking responsibility for your partner\u2019s problems isn\u2019t helping her, it\u2019s infantilizing her. Talk to her like the adult she is, and tell her your concerns and ask how she would like you to support her.  You need to partner with her, not do her work for her. For example she might ask for help creating a nighttime routine so she doesn\u2019t forget to set her alarm or charge her phone. Or you might sit down with her while she looks for therapists who help with this kind of thing.  But you can\u2019t be responsible for her.", "Yeah I hear you, I just feel like as a partner we\u2019re a team and I did her dirty in that regard", "This is unsolicited advice, so take with a grain of salt I suppose. \n\nIf I were you I would have a conversation with her regarding the choices she has. If this comes down to a fault in her character, fine. But she should seek a job or career that can *accomodate* that fault. You have an inherent inability to be on time to things? Well.. why on earth do you have a job where timeliness is of the utmost importance? Its setting yourself up for failure. \n\nIf someone was a recovered alcoholic, and said they were applying to be a bartender. You might say \"hmm.. I don't think thats a *wise* life decision\". The fact they are are a recovered alcoholic doesn't make them a bad person. But knowing that about themselves, and then choosing to work in a bar makes them a *dumb* person.\n\nOtherwise, if she is determined to keep this job, she needs to sort out this character flaw. But she can't have both. She can't have this type of flaw, and that type of job. It wont work. One of those things needs to change.\n\nSo continuing on, not *doing* anything about it, *not* trying to find some sort of sustainable solution, that wouldn't work for me if I were her partner. I wouldn't be sure I could depend on this person as we're building a life together. And I would start to have issue with their decision making abilities and their drive.", "OK I missed that but it still stands that she should have learned already, fresh out of college during the covid years or not she is an adult who has to at least be aware of how the adult world works. You can come up with a million reasons why you should have done this or that because you feel guilty. But honestly my man you have done nothing to fee guilty about, turn this energy into something positive. Sit her down and have a full adult conversation about it, ask if she needs help and what she needs, everything has a root cause, try get to the bottom of it together.", "\u201cHer second late wasn\u2019t caught because she doesn\u2019t have a dedicated classroom.\u201d\n\nHer school has no mechanism for taking teacher attendance and making sure students will be supervised?  That surprises me and does not match my experience.
