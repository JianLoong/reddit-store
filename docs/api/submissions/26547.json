From the sounds of it you have your four year old during the week while your Ex has him for a day, what's more you tried to accommodate him by asking your mother who wasn't able to.\n\n  \nYou're the full time parent while your Ex doesn't, Saturday Night is your only night off and from what you said you've missed out on plenty occasions.

Kids are responsibilities.", "For people saying OP is the asshole, how is having a reasonable bed time for a young child an asshole move? He has the kid one night out of the week. Keeping a young child up out of spite is cruel to the child. He said he would have the kid stay up until he got back and return the kid to mom( I'm assuming) that same night. She just wants to go to  her planned event.  She gets one day off a week to do what she wants with that time.  The other 26 days a month she's a full time parent. Doesn't sound like he's being respectful of her time. It's his parenting time.

My ex and I have a four year old son. I have him full time, but on Saturday nights his dad has him so that I can go and do something for myself. Tonight I have plans for a friends birthday party, something we\u2019ve had reservations for a couple of weeks for.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. \nI can take a guess at why he is an ex. \nHe has some audacity asking you to cancel your plans, especially when it sounds like he only gets him one night.", "This man needs to take more responsibility for his kid than that", "NTA. He's demanding last minute that you cancel your plans.", "Completely correct. What is wrong is the child's father, who only has said child for one night, to make it the mother's problem.", "There isn't any reason the son can't sleep on a couch and most grandparents would love having their grandchild for a evening.", "He did, she says it isn\u2019t good enough", "4 is gonna sleep when 4 sleeps, floor, chair, kitchen counter...", "He did, she said it wasn\u2019t good enough", "Agreed.  While it sucks that he only has 1 day and is essentially skipping it, that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s what OP is upset about.  If it was okay for your mom to watch him it should be fine for his other grandparents to do it.  Staying up a later or snoozing on the couch a bit before being moved home isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nI don\u2019t think you get to dictate where/when your child goes to bed when it\u2019s not your parenting time (within reason of course)", "She's being petty and controlling.", "I remember my grandparents even let me sleep in their bed when I was this age. Poor grandpa slept on the guest couch bed. \nLooking on the pick up time op wrote maybe the grandparents are still awake around this time and it wouldn't even inconvenience someone if the child uses their bed too.", "I was going to say the same thing.  Why does it have to bed a bed ? He could g r t adequate rest on a couch too", "Have you dealt with an over tired young child? It's not fun. She didn't say she was against the grandparents having him at all. How I read it was that he issued a threat and said she must cancel her outing or he'd keep the kid up late until he got home from party at 10/11 pm. That's how it read to me. He threatened her and when one parent has only one night of actually parenting time it's on that person to, you know PARENT.  He could have just went to the party for a little bit then returned home for the kid.  But hey she's the unreasonable parent wanting one night out that was already planned ahead of time.", "As in a babysitter in his home where the kid can sleep.  Messing up the kid's schedule is bad parenting.", "Blow up beds work too. My parents used one for my kids for a bit until they got a bed for the spare room.", "No, she\u2019s unreasonable for telling him leaving him at his parents wouldn\u2019t work.", "I don't read that she said no to the kid being at grandparents just that the kid didn't have a bed to sleep over. I'm sure he could have slept on the couch or something.  As a parent myself I wouldn't want my children wildly thrown off schedule at that age. Especially when I would be the one handling the situation due to the kid not having properly slept the night before.  Why should she be forced to cancel her plans so he can change plans on her a day prior?  She's not the AH for being upset with her ex after he threatened her.", "I'm going against most people and saying one ones the AH except the responses. He can easily leave them with the grandparents and call it a evening. I've been on my grandparents couch as a kid. It won't kill them either.", "Nta, but do you get to dictate his bedtime on a night that his father is watching him?", "His parents could watch the kid. What are you complaining about?", "OP has every Saturday night free. Is it unfair for him to ask for one when his parents can watch the child? No. Kids survive fine sleeping on the couch for a few hours. OP is the AH", "You have to co-parent with this man for the next 14 years. You need to pick your battles better than this otherwise you will have a very miserable 14 years ahead.\n\nAs long as it's a non reoccurring thing, your son getting to bed late won't cause any harm. You also need to accept that unless your exs plan verges into neglect or abuse territory then you can't dictate how he parents on his time. Don't make this a bigger issue than it is.", "Your NTA but he can take the child to his parents house. It\u2019s Saturday night, a bed time routine change isn\u2019t gonna harm the child", "NTA\n\nIt's up to him to figure out babysitting when it's his time.\n\nHowever....it is *his* time. If the kid stays up until 10:30 or 11:00 there's nothing you can do about it. Unless you're going to take him to court and get bedtimes written into the custody agreement.\n\nThough he's 4 years old. At that age, kids can fall asleep anywhere.", "NTA for stating your opinion, which is a valid one. However, in the end your ex will parent his way when it's his time with your son. If this is a pattern with him then he's dropping the ball, and that sucks, but once again you can't dictate his parenting. Maybe you could get family court involved and change the custody arrangement, or maybe the courts will tell you to quit bothering them over parenting squabbles that don't involve abuse, neglect, or endangerment. But it probably won't be worth your while to fight this particular battle.", "NTA - you\u2019re 100% right!", "NTA, I\u2019m pretty sure when a co-worker is having a going away party they notify everyone a few weeks/days before the party, he probably waited last minute so he can get out of the visit or something", "Because all grandparents are loving nurturing figures whose lives revolve around their grandchild.", "A sitter has to be able to meet all of a child's physical needs- and that includes things like the child being able to sleep when it gets late."]}
