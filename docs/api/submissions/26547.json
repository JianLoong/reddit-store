Keeping a young child up out of spite is cruel to the child. He said he would have the kid stay up until he got back and return the kid to mom( I'm assuming) that same night. She just wants to go to  her planned event.  She gets one day off a week to do what she wants with that time.  The other 26 days a month she's a full time parent.

My ex and I have a four year old son. I have him full time, but on Saturday nights his dad has him so that I can go and do something for myself. Tonight I have plans for a friends birthday party, something we\u2019ve had reservations for a couple of weeks for.

He's demanding last minute that you cancel your plans.", "Completely correct. What is wrong is the child's father, who only has said child for one night, to make it the mother's problem.", "There isn't any reason the son can't sleep on a couch and most grandparents would love having their grandchild for a evening.", "He did, she says it isn\u2019t good enough", "4 is gonna sleep when 4 sleeps, floor, chair, kitchen counter...", "He did, she said it wasn\u2019t good enough", "Agreed.  While it sucks that he only has 1 day and is essentially skipping it, that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s what OP is upset about.  If it was okay for your mom to watch him it should be fine for his other grandparents to do it.  Staying up a later or snoozing on the couch a bit before being moved home isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nI don\u2019t think you get to dictate where/when your child goes to bed when it\u2019s not your parenting time (within reason of course)", "She's being petty and controlling.", "I remember my grandparents even let me sleep in their bed when I was this age. Poor grandpa slept on the guest couch bed. \nLooking on the pick up time op wrote maybe the grandparents are still awake around this time and it wouldn't even inconvenience someone if the child uses their bed too.", "I was going to say the same thing.  Why does it have to bed a bed ? He could g r t adequate rest on a couch too", "Have you dealt with an over tired young child? It's not fun. She didn't say she was against the grandparents having him at all. How I read it was that he issued a threat and said she must cancel her outing or he'd keep the kid up late until he got home from party at 10/11 pm. That's how it read to me. He threatened her and when one parent has only one night of actually parenting time it's on that person to, you know PARENT.  He could have just went to the party for a little bit then returned home for the kid.  But hey she's the unreasonable parent wanting one night out that was already planned ahead of time.", "As in a babysitter in his home where the kid can sleep.  Messing up the kid's schedule is bad parenting.", "Blow up beds work too. My parents used one for my kids for a bit until they got a bed for the spare room.", "No, she\u2019s unreasonable for telling him leaving him at his parents wouldn\u2019t work.", "I don't read that she said no to the kid being at grandparents just that the kid didn't have a bed to sleep over. I'm sure he could have slept on the couch or something.  As a parent myself I wouldn't want my children wildly thrown off schedule at that age. Especially when I would be the one handling the situation due to the kid not having properly slept the night before.  Why should she be forced to cancel her plans so he can change plans on her a day prior?  She's not the AH for being upset with her ex after he threatened her."]}
