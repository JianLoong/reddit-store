Daughter hates being related to a criminal because she wants to be a cop. It's fine to dislike your relative to for commiting a crime, and we don't know what he did so I can't judge that, but I do think denying someone a safe place to live in the home they OWN is wrong. And I believe that cops who hate all criminals are a huge reason we have so many disgusting police issues in America. I recognize that it is an incredibly tough job where you see actual horrors committed by criminals and it is hard not to build a prejudice in that line of work, but empathy still needs to be applied in many more cases than it is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO - I think this is really going to depend on why your daughter hates this man. If he did something unforgivable to end up in prison your daughter may have a point, but if her hatred is just a general prejudice against felons then you would be N T A and this would be a great time to remind her that prison is supposed to be where you pay for your crime and rehabilitate so that when you come out you can begin to rejoin society. (I understand the the system at least in the US is majorly fucked and unfair so in practice it's not really like this but let's pretend it actually works the way it should for the point)\n\nSince your brother owns the house and your adult daughter isn't on a rent paying lease and has somewhere else safe to go, he obviously should be allowed to stay there. But since this sub isn't about who is legally right it's about who is morally right I'm holding my judgment until I learn more because while it isn't her house, it is her home.", "Based on his charges and the fact that he owns half the house and the fact that your daughter is an adult, NTA \n\nHe owns the house just as much as you do and has every legal right to be there.", "NTA. The most salient point is that it's as much his house as yours. So your daughter hasn't got a leg to stand on here. It's HIS HOUSE.", "INFO Why was he in prison?  As far as I know most petty crimes won't land you in prison for that long So a little more information would be helpful.", "Nta\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cletting him move into your house\u201d  \u2026 he is moving into his own home.\n\nIf your adult daughter doesn\u2019t like it then she has agency and can move.", "NTA. He\u2019s moving into HIS house, you\u2019re just also co-owner and have been living there without him for a long time. \n\nIf he had violent offenses or something that might make anyone concerned for their safety, it might be different (though still his house!), but it sounds like your daughter is just mostly embarrassed by her relative.", "NTA- he legally owns half the house, she owns nothing. If he was in jail for a sex crime or something I would understand, but it\u2019s selling drugs. Which obviously isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s not like he is inherently dangerous. If she doesn\u2019t want to live with him, she can live with her aunt", "NTA\n\nIt is his home. He has the right to live there. If your daughter doesn't want to live with an ex-convict, no one is forcing her to stay in his house.", "\u201cShe hates being related to a criminal. She wants to be a cop.\u201d\n\nThis could actually jeopardize her future career path. The application process specifically asks for criminal relations & affiliations in *detailed* format. Depending on the competition- she absolutely could get cut. That makes sense that she doesn\u2019t want to live with him. His actions could effect her. \n\nShe\u2019ll probably go no contact with you over this since you chose him over her. So just prepare yourself.", "Honestly having him living there with her would hurt her chances of getting into le.", "NTA. Your daughter forgets that the house belongs to both you and your brother. You can't exclude an owner from the house; if she doesn't want to live with your brother, it's proper for her to find other housing.\n\nYou should rightfully have paid him half of market rent on the house whole he was incarcerated.", "Nta it\u2019s half his house and your daughter is an adult.", "NTA - your brother owns half the house, she doesn't. She is also an adult and can move out on her own. You were nice enough to make other arrangements for her.\n\nJust because she happens to have an ex-convict as a relative does not preclude her from becoming a cop.", "Nta. \n\nMain reason. He laid the price for his crime and DID HIS TIME. Drugs are bad yes but he didn't kill or rape anyone. She wants to be a cop then she needs to learn compassion and the fact tou don't continue to berate, hate, and put down someone who paid their dues. She being a cop will run into people left and right doing wrong. Hatred and having no compassion will mean she won't be a cop for long. .\n\n\nAlso he owns half the house. Not her so she has no say.", "So it was a fake \"drug crime\"? Your daughter can get bent. NTA", "NTA- OP I mean this in the kindest way possible but I truly hope your daughter never becomes a cop of this is her attitude towards her own family member that just got out of prison. I have a feeling that she would be the type of cop that causes a riot/protest.", "NTA. boot the kid. she is an adult. and let her make her bed. OP\u2019s bro is entitled to half of the house. so if he wanted, he could live there.", "NOTE: Changed to NTA based on subsequent OP comments. Sounds like daughter was on board with the plan until she decided to study to become a cop.\n\nOriginal comment:\n\n\\---\n\nOne, your daughter's feelings are completely understandable. Her uncle has been in prison since she was a young child, and now she's expected to share living space with him (you didn't mention what he did time for, which might be relevant to her concerns). She's an adult and I expect does not have a legal 'right' to live in that house if you choose to not have her there, but clearly you have not done the work to understand why your daughter 'hates' her uncle.\n\nIf you knew that the post-prison plan was for your brother to occupy the house with your daughter, it was on you to prepare for this conflict and work with both your brother AND your daughter to figure out a way forward.\n\n\\>>once my brother gets used to things on the outside and gets his parole transferred to another county, my nephew and him plan to move to another city in a place my dad owned.\n\nThat's a big \"if\" that this takes place in 6 months.\n\nI also think it's somewhat interesting that you seem to side against your own daughter in your words / phrasing. I also think it's understandable that your brother's own son might feel differently than his niece does.", "Need more info what type of crime did he go away for?", "For thinking that it is not a big deal for what your brother did you are an AH.  It was not a onetime thing; he is a convicted drug dealer multiple time. Dealing enough to be sent to prison for 15 years.  Understand that if or when he deals again if she is living in the same house, it can hurt her career.", "Info: why does she hate him? Does it have anything to do with the crime he was convicted of?", "YTA why\u2019s he been in prison, why she not comfortable with him living there, how can you pick him over your daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cops who have a deep hatred for criminals are a big reason why the US often feels like a police state, has major gang issues within the force, and murders so many people during what should have just been regular stops or arrests.

You're not accountable for her prejudice, but the fact is, once she turned 18, you should have been acclimating her to the idea that her uncle was going to occupy the home when he got paroled. If she wasn't okay with that, you should have been helping her understand that she'd need to move out.", "Every legal right perhaps.  \n\nI'd still be pissed about it.

Hatred is what gets people hurt and makes for a shitty cop. \n\nShe needs an attitude adjustment.", "I don't see \"entitlement\" in the daughter.  The daughter was ultimately moved out to her half-sister's house.
