Perhaps you live in Canada and it is 0\u00b0, I would expect that the electric company's urgency would correspond with the lower temperatures.\n\nThe probable biggest issue is that they might not have what it takes to get the electric turned on. Because sometimes a deposit is required, etc.  But that is not your problem. It is the reason why I would tell them versus waiting for them to experience it.
