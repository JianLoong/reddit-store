Perhaps you live in Canada and it is 0\u00b0, I would expect that the electric company's urgency would correspond with the lower temperatures.\n\nThe probable biggest issue is that they might not have what it takes to get the electric turned on. Because sometimes a deposit is required, etc.  But that is not your problem. It is the reason why I would tell them versus waiting for them to experience it.

He promptly called, irate. \u201cYou told me to come and get them!\u201d he whined.\n\n\u201cI did. I never said that I\u2019d washed what was inside,\u201d I answered.", "Oh, Redditors, this event absolutely did occur.. \n\nAnd when divorcing him, my attorney successfully squashed my ex\u2019s request for a settlement and alimony. When I left (can\u2019t say \u201cwe separated.\u201d I left), I worked for a prominent environmental organization that paid me $11,000 a year, a pathetic salary even forty years ago.", "every US state I have lived in a rental has done this. OP should just double check though.", "Then they'll send the shitty what kind of person does that oh poor me text lol", "Not to mention who'll pay for for everything now that OP's gone.\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd that is SOME VERY nasty petty, OP.  I LURVED it.", "I was wondering that very thing.\nAt what point did OP say to the friend/legal tenant \"let's take your name off the electricity bill and put it in mine?\" And why would OP do that, given that OP wothen be liable for the whole bill/s?\n\nThis doesn't ring true.", "No you are right. I went back to edit it. Ethylene is in antifreeze and propylene is in food processing.", "I've read the full post. Champ.", "I read it. Why does that supercede what it says in the title?", "To be fair, I too often confuse the notion of \"wife\" with \"indentured servant\".\n\nThey clearly sound almost exactly the same. \n\n/s", "He sounds like such a peach. I would love to hear more.", "That should give OP a good laugh \ud83d\ude01", "They lost me at antifreeze in the pipes.", "Also the question at the very end, dollface?", "The subredit is in the form of a question. That question was asked at the bottom of op, after the explanation. The title obviously was worded as such to get more attention.", "I\u2019d grown up as an indentured servant. So having married this guy right after graduating from uni, it took a while\u2014including therapy\u2014to learn that there *should* be a different between a servant and a wife.", "Okay, you\u2019re on. One of the ways by which I was expected to prove my love to my ex was to include his pet boa constrictor in the equation. He had used a coffee can as the starting point of a trap that would catch live mice in the warehouse in which he worked part time.\n\nBy \u201cpart time,\u201d I mean that he only worked a couple of days a week. And either the trap wasn\u2019t very effective or the mice were uncharacteristically bright. I became accustomed to the phone call at 5 p.m., asking me to pick up Lillian\u2019s dinner at the pet shop on the way to the commuter bus.\n\nThe warehouse mice *were* smarter. The minute they were placed into the terrarium, they *freaked out* (\u201cOMG, what\u2019s this?!? Where am I?\u201d). By contrast, the big fat lummoxes from the pet store bounced around, oblivious to the fact they no longer occupied one of those takeout boxes with a wire handle.\n\nWhen I left Lillian, I deprived *her* of a \u201chot meal\u201d as well.", "I missed that bit!", "You monster. Please ma'am may I have some more.\n\nThe balls on this one perplexes me. I have never been blessed to meet someone like him. The petty shit I would do in each of these situations.", "Judging from the outrage expressed by his family, they considered me petty AF.\n\nOh, I didn\u2019t mention that \u2018way back then, so-called DIY \u201cturkey-baster babies\u201d had become a thing. I had an infertile BIL and SIL whose eyes were fixed on my flat midsection as they repeatedly begged me to serve as their surrogate. In those mostly pre-IVF years, surrogacy would have required fertilizing my very own egg.\n\nAfter receiving a post-separation letter begging once again for a baby, I replied that I\u2019d \u201cessentially given up\u201d on the possibility of adding any children to the family. The couple seized one last time on the word \u201cessentially.\u201d They replied by return mail (our only pre-Internet option), \u201cYou mean *you\u2019d still consider it?!?\u201d*\n\nI replied (again by return mail), \u201c*For G-d\u2019s sake! No!\u201d\n\nAfter one butthurt admonition from them \u201cnot to take the Lord\u2019s name in vain,\u201d our rapidfire correspondence ended.", "Wow just wow"]}
