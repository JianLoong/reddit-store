Wills of deceased people are public records, you should be able to get a copy for yourself at the county offices for just a few bucks. It wouldn't hurt to quietly (without letting the uncle know) get a consult appointment to have a lawyer read over the will and the documents your uncle sent to see if they're legitimate. If he's pulling something shady and you have to take him to court he will be *personally* responsible and not the estate, which means that it won't reduce anyone's inheritance, but if he's embezzled from the estate he'll be ordered to pay it back plus punitive damages, which means the inheritance would actually get bigger from the payout. You wouldn't be contesting the will because you agree with the assets being split the way they're supposed to be split, you'd be suing your shady uncle to make him actually do his duty and follow what he was supposed to do.

NTA and get a lawyer yesterday.", "NTA.\n\nI must be greedy. If I have moey coming to me, I wouldn't be waiting 16 years for probate", "NTA, Lawyer up!!!", "*SIXTEEN YEARS*\n\nWas he a trillionaire with 1,200 specific bequests? That is the only explanation I can think of.\n\nCan you audit people? Because your uncle needs his finances checked. Let's start around 16 years ago.", "Lawyer up. Now.\n\nNTA\n\n(Almost guarantee you this money is gone though)", "NTA. Hire an attorney. Sounds like you need it. He can't take money he's not entitled to, and if he did, it's illegal. Don't spend more than you stand to inherit, though.", "Shouldn't the Uncle have been paying rent to the estate if he was in the house all that time?", "You should have hired a lawyer 15 years ago. That money is long gone. And no, executors can't do anything they want with the will. They literally execute the will as written. To legally contest a will you have to go through probate court. And if those cousins are his kids, they want you to shut up because they already got theirs and don't want you to find out that they got yours too.", "Fees are definitely an issue.  Uncle has to account for any fees with detail of what he was doing for the estate.", "This right here. He has for sure stolen. I wonder if the house was rented out over the years too? That rent goes to them as well, if I reme.ber correctly", "And can be held legally liable for the whole estate.", "Is it possible that your cousins have received their share, and possibly your portion as well and that's why they aren't complaining? Are these cousins your uncle's kids? People aren't complacent when they are being screwed over nor are they secretive when they have nothing to hide.", "He's taken your share and either spent it himself or given it to them. Get a lawyer, now.", "Doesn't matter, contact a lawyer. Mute everyone. NTA", "If the will says everything is equally divided between all the grandchildren then that's what he has to do, he can't just decide to do whatever he wants because he's the executor. Unless the will is very vague and doesn't specify how much - either in specific amounts or percentages each person gets. But that would have been very poor planning on your grandfather's part. You uncle is hiding something, either the money is gone already or he has plans for you not to get anything. There is not one single legitimate reason why he would be hiding the will. Not to mention hide it for 16 years, that is beyond absurd.", "I agree.  My husband was the sole beneficiary of his mother's estate.  His aunt was the executor.  She kept him in the loop on everything and the estate lawyer she hired to help with the paperwork kept us informed of everything.\n\nAlso, in our state, you can look up an estate online under the probate office of your state.  In our state, it's the Orphans Court that handles probate.  I could just go right to the website and find out what where along the line the probate was and purchase any documents that were submitted to them, including my MIL's will.  \n\nOP should look into their states probate court (assuming they are in the US) and see if there are any documents / pending probate.", "Agreed. But OP should schedule an appointment with an Estate Attorney, the initial consult is usually free to discuss next steps. \n\nLet the Uncle e plan to the Attorney and possibly a Judge as to why the will was never produced and why he never gave OP their work heritable. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I wonder if the cousins, are the uncles kids tbh", "also the cousins may have benefited from whatever the uncle has been doing as executor, if they're nearby or closer to him, so they don't see the \"problem\" and may even be worried they're going to get caught too...", "I have a job where I sometimes pay estates. There was an estate that was open for years. I called the executor once cuz I was sorta- really? it's still open it's been years. The guy was an attorney and he response was basically like- right? fml, this one is freaking never-ending.\n\nMost? A year to two. Some are open and closed in less than 6 months.", "My thought as well.", "I'm thinking the cousins are uncles kids"]}
