You are waiting for 16 years for this inheritance. Would have called fpor a lawer after just two years of grieving. Especially as the house is now sold and everything looks fishy.\n\nWhat do your cousins think of the situation?\n\nI would tell the uncle, he has till the end of the month to get you the real paper work or you hire a lawer because you don't know anything about this stuff and are afraid of any legal/tax fraud thingy. So you want someone professional look into this.", "NTA. 16 years! By itself, that's sketchy.\n\n>telling everyone their inheritance would be reduced and delayed by me.\n\nHe means delayed beyond the 16 years it's already been delayed?\n\nBest tactic: Tell nobody. Consult a lawyer. Get a plan together and ambush uncle with a legal demand for the information he's been so intent on hiding. Do it before he removes more money that he already has done.\n\nOnce that happens, tell everyone that you're not contesting the will; you're making sure its terms are being carried out under legal oversight.", "NTA - 16 years is a long time to settle an estate. Your uncle's thought of getting a lawyer is a good one. You should do that.", "NTA and here's some advice while I'm at it. Wills of deceased people are public records, you should be able to get a copy for yourself at the county offices for just a few bucks. It wouldn't hurt to quietly (without letting the uncle know) get a consult appointment to have a lawyer read over the will and the documents your uncle sent to see if they're legitimate. If he's pulling something shady and you have to take him to court he will be *personally* responsible and not the estate, which means that it won't reduce anyone's inheritance, but if he's embezzled from the estate he'll be ordered to pay it back plus punitive damages, which means the inheritance would actually get bigger from the payout. You wouldn't be contesting the will because you agree with the assets being split the way they're supposed to be split, you'd be suing your shady uncle to make him actually do his duty and follow what he was supposed to do. His behavior sounds like someone with something to hide, and if he really is going against your grandpa's wishes he deserves whatever bad thing happens to him because of it.", "NTA.  Hire a probate attorney.  Unfortunately, having seen this many times, the inheritance is likely gone.", "An executor can\u2019t just do whatever they want, there are laws. Where I live they have one year to settle the estate. (Pay the debts, sell and/or distribute assets etc) 16 years can\u2019t be acceptable anywhere. You should definitely get it looked into. Tell your family that he is the one who has unnecessarily delayed their inheritance and that if he\u2019s above board he should have no problem with you looking into things.", "NTA. Get an attorney.", "You probably should have gotten a lawyer years ago.  It doesn't take 16 years to settle an uncomplicated estate. It's possible that your other cousins have already been paid off and they don't want you to know that you've been screwed.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. There's not reason whay you can't see the will. Let everyone know you're not contesting it, you just want to see the details. After 16 years his behaviour is suspicious. Get a lawyer A lawyer will help you get a copy of the will.", "He's likely been spending down your inheritance for the past 16-years. You're NTA.", "NTA, you are rightfully afraid of being screwed over by your uncle. He is sketchy about it, if he was innocent, he would have no problem sharing all of the information with you.", "Everyone was supposedly in agreement with the grandchildren being the beneficiary, but I get the impression from my uncle that maybe he was only agreeing in order to look good to his brothers.", "NTA get a lawyer, this is beyond ridiculous, executors cannot do whatever they want.  Something shady is going on here.", "NTA. This is something that is wayyyy above the pay grade of this sub. Get a lawyer ASAP.", "Depending on your state- there is a certain amount of time to wrap up an estate. 16 years is way beyond that time. Follow the advice you\u2019ve been given here to get a copy of the will and find a probate or estate attorney to look it over and also look at the shady documents your uncle had provided. Most likely the money is all gone but at least you\u2019ll know what\u2019s what.", "NtA get a lawyer he's probably stealing from you. Family is usually the worst when it comes to money", "NTA and immediately get a lawyer and get the relevant information you need and get your portion of what is owed. 16 years it literally insane to leave it, this should have been sorted like 15 years ago!", "NTA, definitely not.\n\nPut it this way, my grandma just passed away a week ago. I got my inheritance cheque from my aunt this morning.\n\nSomeone who isn't hiding something does not take 16 years to execute the will. \n\nAlso, he is wrong, he cannot do whatever he wants as the executor, that is ridiculous. The will clearly spells out what everyone is entitled to and how it is to be split. If your uncle has been spending the funds, then he needs to be able to show justification that the expenses were necessary to the execution of the will. Anything else is fraud, as far as I understand.\n\nI'm sure this differs from region to region, country to country, but where I'm at, it is highly, highly illegal to use the estate's funds for any other purpose than distributing the inheritance, or settling the debts of the estate.\n\nThere is essentially a 0% chance that the estate still has outstanding obligations after 16 years.\n\nOP, is there any chance that, as you don't live nearby, everyone else knows that the uncle has been using the money, but the family is ok with this for some reason? That would explain the lack of pushback.", "NTA. You need a lawyer and should have gotten one a LONG time ago.", "NtA reach out to your other cousins who are set to inherit and tell them you suspect after 16 years uncle embezzled. Would they rather blindly blame you for questioning a susicious timeline or find out what they are actually owed? Money turns opinions quickly", "You should get an estate lawyer.\n\nI do  not understand why the rest of the family is lampooning you.\n\n!6 yrs to settle an estate seem unusually long.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHe's hiding something.  Providing copies of the will to all beneficiaries is just common sense.", "NTA, I think. \n\nIf you\u2019re the grandchild, what do your parents and their siblings think of the situation?

Also if the house did in fact sell then probate should be open, otherwise the uncle would not have been able to sign as the estate's representative at closing.\n\nWhich brings up another point, OP can also check the county tax records to see if the transfer of ownership for the house has been processed."]}
