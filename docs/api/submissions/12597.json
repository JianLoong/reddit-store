I said it in a different thread a couple days ago, but in a healthy relationship, it doesn't matter if you personally don't find an issue with something. If it's an issue for your partner, it's an issue for your relationship. Relationships are a partnership; issues and disagreements should be approached as the couple v the issue, not one partner against the other nor one partner against the issue on their own.

Or does shock affect each person differently? Also he wasn't mad at her in the moment, it appears he got mad after when she tried to discuss it. People can tease and joke with each other in relationships. You need to understand the dynamics of said relationship. Obviously this girl doesn't like to be teased like that.

How about since she is the same age she focuses on her own growth by learning how to separate herself from toxic people?

I'm more interested in his reaction to you being upset, whether it was warranted or not, you were upset at his joke and he punished you for your reaction, he's showing you that he doesn't care about what you feel, and that you're being an inconvenience to him for not just allowing him to say whatever he wants with no reaction", "NTA. When my husband and I first started dating, I saw him out at lunch with a coworker I hadn't met yet and said hello. His first words were \"What do YOU want?\". I said something like, \"Nothing, anymore\" walked away and texted him that he was not only rude to me, greeted me as if he was unhappy to see me, in which case we didn't need to be dating, but also humiliated me in front of his coworker and a stranger to me. He agreed, said it was a very poor joke and apologized profusely. It never happened again. You are not a trash can. Do you want to be with and potentially marry and have kids with a man who calls you one in front of his friends and family?", "NTA.  A joke isn't actually a joke unless it's found funny by the person to whom it is directed.  YOU didn't find it funny.  NTA at all, but your BF is definitely showing his true colors", "NTA if it is a joke to call your s/o a trash can I have never heard it before. Due to your social issues (mood btw) it seems he has no issue with putting you down to keep your self esteem low.

It's better to be alone than with someone who treats you poorly. You deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m paraphrasing a bit I read on Captain Awkward, but imagine you meet a stranger on a park bench and have a chat.  You say something innocuous, like \u201cthe maple trees are sure pretty\u201d but the other person goes white and starts ugly crying, saying that they recently lost a loved one to a freak maple tree accident.\n\nThere is no way a reasonable person would suspect that, but as a decent human you apologize and offer condolences.  Offer a snack or water, or a tissue, yeah?  This is basic kindness we show to a stranger.  We see a person struggling and want to make it better.\n\nSo you\u2019re with someone who likes you enough for sex, apparently, and find yourself in uncomfortable situations.  Instead of being supportive, he\u2019s demeaning you and making it worse.  Whether he meant it or not, you were hurt by his words.  He doesn\u2019t get to decide if your feelings are right or wrong.  They\u2019re your feelings.  When his \u201cjoke\u201d is called out as being rude, he doesn\u2019t apologize - he blames you.  The victim.  The one he hurt.  \n\nDo you start to see how inappropriate his treatment is?  That your mother thinks you\u2019re \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d and is also invalidating your feelings tells me that we may have found the root of your social anxiety issues and acceptance of abusive behavior.  Sometimes we stay because the abuse feels normal.  \n\nHugs to you, sis.  You can do better than that dumpster fire of a boyfriend.
