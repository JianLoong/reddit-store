I\u2019d say dump him but the real problem is that you\u2019re both so young and immature so I suppose there\u2019s a chance he could eventually develop into a better person and you might develop self esteem", "Info: Did they take the candy from your plate, unwrap it, and return the garbage to your plate?\n\nSeems like a poor joke didn't land well and you took offense to it. If you really think this is something to break up over go ahead. I'm assuming you were not talking much and being somewhat awkward. Maybe the cousin tried to get you involved in some way and you didn't like the way. Some families are more prone to tease and straight up insult each other. If you don't like that make it clear why it was upsetting to your bf. \n\nThis is a great opportunity to learn about how you are in relationships!

You don\u2019t even know how she voiced her humiliation or if she did at all. Based on the story, it sounds like she made an appalled face (understandably so) and then boyfriend blamed her for \u201cnot being able to take a joke\u201d. Your girlfriend, wife, etc isn\u2019t your punchline for a stupid, baseless joke, she\u2019s a human. Get over your machismo bullshit and don\u2019t humiliate people, it\u2019s not hard", "This is what a good partner does. I said it in a different thread a couple days ago, but in a healthy relationship, it doesn't matter if you personally don't find an issue with something. If it's an issue for your partner, it's an issue for your relationship. Relationships are a partnership; issues and disagreements should be approached as the couple v the issue, not one partner against the other nor one partner against the issue on their own. He refuses to do this, and then takes it further by giving the silent treatment, which is inappropriate in a relationship, especially done by the person who did wrong in the situation. He just sounds *mean* and like he doesn't want to own up to his meanness", "I would say maybe try and bring it up one more time when stuff has cooled a bit more and really try to get them to understand your feelings in the moment. If they still continue to not respect or listen to you or your feelings, do you want to continue being with someone who does that? \n\nFrom my pov this is something very small and could sooooooooo easily be worked out. CLEAR COMMUNICATION FIXES SO MUCH!! If he doesn't even want to attempt that, what's he really bringing to the table?", "Did you miss the part where I put I'm assuming? I'm making my conclusions on the post. I'm assuming she didn't voice much. You are assuming she made a face? She was being introduced to a brand new family dynamic. It wasn't going to be seamless and perfect", "I have come to the conclusion this is your boyfriends burner account", "She literally says she was in shock and then he got mad, who would assume someone in shock said something and left that detail out? You\u2019re reaching because you are likely this type of guy who insults his partner like this, thinks it\u2019s funny, and when someone gets offended by your stupid, baseless joke, you blame the person. Things don\u2019t have to be seem less and perfect, but if basic decency should be a bare minimum requirement", "Wrong, she was in shock, can you tell me exactly what a shocked face looks like? Or does shock affect each person differently? Also he wasn't mad at her in the moment, it appears he got mad after when she tried to discuss it. People can tease and joke with each other in relationships. You need to understand the dynamics of said relationship. Obviously this girl doesn't like to be teased like that. I wonder if the bf knew this? I'm ASSUMING this family makes fun of each other in an endearing way. YOU DONT HAVE TO BE OKAY WITH THAT. \n\nI'm nothing like your idea of me either! I need to play devils advocate here because the first 12 comments are just telling this 18 year old person to dump and walk away. You can learn so much from relationships if you just try! Obviously this guy probably isn't worth the effort but for some reason IDK they are dating.", "You have never heard of a shocked face? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Her story goes from \u201cI was in shock\u201d to immediately \u201che got mad at me\u201d, which is really odd you would assume that there was some gap in time, conversation, etc. Truth of the matter is, her boyfriend sounds like an immature kid who doesn\u2019t have concerns for her feelings based on the initial action and his later reaction to her communication, she\u2019s just meeting his family so it\u2019s likely not that deep yet, so why should she have to sit through verbal abuse while some kids grows and learns? How about since she is the same age she focuses on her own growth by learning how to separate herself from toxic people? But then again, that would benefit the female rather than excusing the male \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
