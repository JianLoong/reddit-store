Just find some random teenage babysitter and dip out?", "NTA, people bring their babies and kids to showers all the time!

There was a baby at my baby shower, and it never even crossed my mind to be annoyed about that!", "NTA,  so your sister allows other kids but is mad because you brought your 2 month old? It doesn't make sense and seems unreasonable on your sisters part. Who did she expect to watch your baby? After she has her kid, let's see how willing she is to leave her 2 month old with a stranger.", "This comments section is juicy lol. Fight! Fight!
