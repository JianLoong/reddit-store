Just find some random teenage babysitter and dip out?", "NTA, people bring their babies and kids to showers all the time! Of course if it\u2019s the first time some of your family is meeting your baby, they\u2019re gonna be excited.

There was a baby at my baby shower, and it never even crossed my mind to be annoyed about that!", "NTA,  so your sister allows other kids but is mad because you brought your 2 month old?
