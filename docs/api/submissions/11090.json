There was a baby at my baby shower, and it never even crossed my mind to be annoyed about that!", "NTA,  so your sister allows other kids but is mad because you brought your 2 month old?

NTA.", "It\u2019s just the way the cookie crumbled.  \n\nSister will get her attention when her baby is born too.", "And isn't the \"special day\" the day you conceived or found out you were pregnant or the day you gave birth? Does the sister actually think her \"special day\" in regards to her future baby is the day she opens her 10th package of diapers and eats cake? \n\nSo, this isn't about Sister's baby. This is about stealing her stupid thunder. Many people like babies, like to coo at them and cuddle them. \n\nIn other news, puppies are cute.", "She probably just had her first round of shots.", "She knows it as well since she says that ppl were fascinated by her baby.", "Or have her family host/create another event? There's any number of ways that OP could have made this better for her sister.", "Omg LOL! Your comment made me laugh so hard. It's like a redefinition for the term circle jerk. And it's also how I'll think of these people from now on.", "really, is she goign to be jealous when her own baby gets more attention that she does.", "Ok, it's late, so maybe I'm just tired, but I've read your post several times, and I'm still asking myself, \"How does someone have between 2 and 6 kids?? Do you sometimes have 3, but on other days there are 5? How does someone \"get closer\" to 6??\"  Lol, there's no judgement whatsoever in my comment, but I AM genuinely curious! \ud83d\ude09\n\nETA: It doesn't sound like this is a \"We have the step-kids on the weekend\" type situation, but maybe that's the explanation? Lol, or I just need to get some sleep!", "So OP doesn't have any friends at all? Hasn't built any relationships to use for emergency babysitting? \nIf not, shes missing a very important part of being a parent", "I interpreted it as that the commenter has had to go to similar events when she had 2. 3. 4, 5, and 6 kids, and each time had to wrangle more. Or that maybe her kids are between 2 and 6 years of age?", "I'm just trying to be vague so no one can ID me, that's all lol.", "Ah, those are actually excellent ideas! They did explain it in another post, but yours make sense, too!", "Lol, ok, thanks for the explanation! ;)", "No worries! I totally get the confusion!", "...and I'm over here thinking a 2 month old I'm a crowd being passed around during a global health crisis and flu season with RSV running rampant.....", "Every shower Ive ever been to has the energy of \"We're waiting for your new friend!\" with pictures of the new baby with the pregnant lady. I have pictures like this. My friends have pictures like this. I cant think of a shower Ive been to that doesnt have a baby less than a year old in attendance. Your sister is being a bit of a brat. NTA", "Info: Before you had your baby, did someone throw you a shower? During that shower, did anyone else choose to announce an engagement? A pregnancy? How would you have felt if they did?", "NTA. And i hope your sister realizes this and apologizes. Your sister should have been right there with you when your new baby was being introduced to everyone. She should have put on a smile and said things like \u201ci can\u2019t wait for our kids to be besties!\u201d and even offered to take pictures. jealousy is a terrible trait and i hope your sister sees this and comes around. i\u2019m sorry she is acting like this.", "NTA, but\u2026\nYou\u2019re not the asshole. The general assumption imo is that, barring a few fancy adult-only events, nursing moms of very young babies and their babies are a unit. Once babies get mobile, not so much, but a 2 month old? Yeah that kiddo gets strapped on and worn and comes everywhere.\n\nBut, that said, I can see how if this was the first time people were meeting your daughter, your sister could feel jealous and upstaged. So, maybe giving her a heads up that you were bringing your daughter would have been good. But, NTA. 2 month old baby and mom are a package deal, and even more so when dad is deployed!", "I don\u2019t understand this trend with brides and baby showers where ALL attention must be focused on them at all times. Maybe bringing a new baby to the shower wasn\u2019t ideal, but the choice was to bring the baby or not go at all.\n\nI just don\u2019t remember this culture of \u201cME\u201d that seems to have become the norm for women celebrating milestone events. It\u2019s so childish and small.", "I must have had a messed up time growing up, because in my time I remember going to showers or whatever event, and there would be a lot of family, and people would spend the entire afternoon talking and spending time with eachother. Sure there was parts of the evening where we focus on the person themself, but did she expect everyone to just stare at her pregnant belly all day? I cant wrap my head around this shit. Nta", "NTA straight up", "pretty sure leaving a 2 month old by themselves at home breaks some sort of law. even in states without a minimum age requirement.\n\nbut also she could have talked to you before hand if it was child friendly. being child friendly means children welcome. your family though, maybe they are a bit dense. i can see why it hurt her feelings but what she did after was unnecessary.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat else where you supposed to do with your baby?", "What is it with people who expect mothers to leave newborns at home? She\u2019s deluded and she\u2019s going to find the reality out the hard way. NTA", "YTA. Yes you did do it on purpose, \" There was family there that hadn't met her yet.\" Not the time not the place. If you had no one to leave the baby with you should have stayed home. Nice way to make it all about you.", "NTA - oh yes let me just leave my 2months old baby at home alone.\nOh what do you mean I should have stayed at home ok then sorry.\n\n-stays home- \n\nWhy didnt you come to my baby shower!?!?!?!\n\nOp you can\u2019t win with these kind of people.", "NTA. doesn\u2019t she know she\u2019ll get the same attention once she has her own baby? also, who tf gets jealous of a baby? lol", "NTA your sister sounds exhausting and how is she gonna react when no one pays her any attention but pays her baby attention? She needs to grow up quick before she gives birth!", "Right?! It's a baby shower, not a lifetime achievement award.", "I doubt people ignored her the entire time. They would have to all be crazy to even do that. How much attention could you possibly give a baby ? Even if someone is excited they aren\u2019t going to hover over the baby for 2 or 3 hours straight.", "I'm so glad I found a different opinion because all the top ones were just N T A.....imo I think NAH..yes it was horrible not to communicate before hand but also if you invite someone who very recently just had a child, expect that the child will come with them. I think OP didn't have any other option other than not going and I also think her sister wanted to enjoy her day and feel celebrated and loved on which did not happen. Mistakes were made but neither of them were AHs to me...the rest of the family though very much suck", "She probably didn\u2019t think about it because she\u2019s in a haze of exhaustion and postpartum hormones. I could barely remember my birthdate for the doctor 8 weeks postpartum, let alone thinking through theoretical social ramifications of going to parties I was invited to.", "Would have loved it, I don\u2019t need 100% of the attention, love babies, especially babies that are related to me.", "As she should, because it\u2019s a family event, and you should bring family\u2026 to family events\u2026 y\u2019all are wild with the obsession with the spotlight.", "Yes, I do feel for the sister who's baby shower was over shadowed by everyone cooing over the new baby. Maybe the OP should even have come later into the event so her sister would get some time being the centre of attention.", "Not everyone has 30 different parties for their new baby, and thank god. OP did nothing wrong. How very gross and self-centered of the sister. NTA", "But the thing is this party was meant to be celebrating the sisters new baby not a first time meeting for OPs baby", "She is 21 not 16 and it's obvious that this will happen. Not saying she's the A H, I just don't agree with the age comment.", ">At her age there\u2019s no way she thought this was going to happen\n\nShe's young but presumably not stupid. Of course everyone was going to be all over the new baby, who is the first child of that generation and who nobody had met yet.", "Minded what? Maybe OP should've left it at home or tied it outside to a lamp post if it weren't allowed inside. /s\n\nWe're talking about a 2 month old baby - a small human- not a pet here. And for heaven's sake, it's a baby shower, which is a party to celebrate the love and excitement friends and facility feel with arrival of a new baby (not the mom).", "She\u2019s still bleeding, probably leaking milk everywhere, likely barely sleeping. Without a partner at home helping? Amazing she made it to the party at all.", "She was supposed to plan and host a party while a single mother to a less than two month old? Are you kidding? No way. It\u2019s amazing she made it to her sister\u2019s party in clean clothes.", "It is really unfair indeed. The first months you are getting used to your new life and rhytm (in most cases there isn\u2019t any yet). I could barely shower before 2 PM so let alone host anything or go to an event with my whole family.", "THANK YOU. Came here to say the same. The fact that she even made it to the shower two months PP is mpressive.", "Gotta get that practice in!", "\"I'm sorry I have to leave because all of you want to see my baby and you're supposed to be fawning over my sister.\" \n\nYeah I'm sure that would've gone over really well.", "So she didn\u2019t even get to meet your baby but at her event you decided to bring your baby to meet everyone. How is being 2 months old any better at fighting sickness? Your baby shouldn\u2019t be passed around like that.", "Yes, yes that is exactly what she should have said. Word for word. It's the perfect way to, again, make everything about you.\n\n/s.", "Schr\u00f6dinger's kids?", "Friends you can leave your two month old baby with, if she\u2019s even comfortable leaving her baby at all? Those are hard to come by. I would say the VAST majority of parents i know don\u2019t have anyone they would leave their newborn infant with that isn\u2019t direct family (parents or siblings). All her family was at this event. Plus, if she\u2019s breastfeeding the kid is still eating every 2 hours at that point anyway, it\u2019s logistically challenging to leave them.", "This is not an emergency. This is a baby shower. With her family. Who would probably think something was wrong with her mentally to leave a two month old baby with a friend to come to this event. So instead of people cooing over the baby, they would be asking \u2018where is the baby?\u2019", "People are just taking this too far at this point. She doesn\u2019t need to leave her newborn baby with someone else to go to a baby shower, this is getting stupid."]}
