To be honest I can understand how she feels upset about acrylics being applied when she apparently is against that and that it's an expense to fix them, but as I said, she should have *communicated* with the kid about what exactly she was going to be doing.\n\nYou are TA for taking your girlfriend's side, knowing your sister's experience level and not telling your gf and then calling your sister a liar (which she is not because, get this, to kids a month is awhile!), expecting her to understand what your gf meant, and being cool with your gf going off on your sister like that.

Instead of having your sister\u2019s back, you double down on hacking to pieces her self esteem by telling her to stay away from your GF.  You didn\u2019t have to tell her that.
