To be honest I can understand how she feels upset about acrylics being applied when she apparently is against that and that it's an expense to fix them, but as I said, she should have *communicated* with the kid about what exactly she was going to be doing.\n\nYou are TA for taking your girlfriend's side, knowing your sister's experience level and not telling your gf and then calling your sister a liar (which she is not because, get this, to kids a month is awhile!), expecting her to understand what your gf meant, and being cool with your gf going off on your sister like that.

Instead of having your sister\u2019s back, you double down on hacking to pieces her self esteem by telling her to stay away from your GF.  You didn\u2019t have to tell her that.  Your sister will definitely stay away from your GF.  Your GF will avoid your sister too.\n\nEDIT:  corrected typo.", "YTA. Your gf isn't blunt, she's an asshole.

It's not like she's going to go enrol in a nail technician course at 10 years old and she's too young to be employed as one.\n\nIf she was that concerned about the outcome she should have politely declined or requested that she use different products in advance.

Sometimes you have to be abit more careful with people's feelings.

First of all, I'm not a troll...I'm glad you know the scenario so very well. You should have been there to referee the whole situation since you know it so well...but you weren't.  I have an opinion, and I stated it.  You can keep coming at me as much as you want.  I understand what it is like to be a teenager as well.  They do not think with the most rational brains.  Yes, she could have handled it better, but I do understand her being upset.  She had every right to be.  The boyfriend could have said something, the 12 year old could have just said she is learning or YOU could have been there to walk everyone through everything...Unfortunately her nails look like poop, she's a teenager, she's not a full on adult.
