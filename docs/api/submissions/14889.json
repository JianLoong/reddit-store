In the beginning of our relationship, we were both in college and pursuing our respective degrees. After we both finished our degrees, we decided to get married and entered the workforce (I entered a year before her, as I am a year older).\n\nAfter a few years of marriage, my wife and I decided to have a baby, and we had a beautiful baby boy who is almost 1 year old now. After the baby was born, however, my wife's attitude towards her job began to change. She quickly began to loathe it and after she cried to me that she hated being away from the baby, she decided to quit her job (she consulted me on this decision ofc) and become a housewife.\n\nThe issue is, while I make a good amount of money at my job, with the added burden of a new baby, a housewife and a mortgage, I had to increase my hours.\n\nI work really late hours and I simply do not have the energy to cook myself a whole meal when I come home. I need some time to just relax before I have to put myself into the meat grinder again so we can have a roof over our heads. This came to a head a few days ago, when I came home at 9:00pm with nothing prepared for anyone (except the baby). She makes herself dinner still and we used to do our own chores when she worked, but now I have to work longer, while she has more time.\n\nWith this and tired/frustrated from work, I calmly asked if she could cook for me. She said she wasn't my maid, and to cook for myself. This turned into a huge argument and we haven't talked since. Despite the entire argument, I still think I am right here. I work my ass off day and night, put myself through hell day after day after day, working 70-80 hours a week. All I want is a warm meal when I get home and not having to do my own laundry. Now, in her defense, besides laundry, lawn-maintenance, and cooking, she does do all the other chores. She cleans the house and of course she takes care of the baby. AITA?\n\n**Edit (Someone DMed me to add this comment to my original post):**\n\nI live in San Jose, and I live about 35 minutes away from my work. That means, including the return-trip, I spend about 1 hour and 10 minutes on commute everyday (to work from home & from work to home). To make the math easy, let's round that to 1 hour.\n\nPlus, I need to sleep a minimum of 6.5 hours a night. That isn't to mention that I usually take 30 minutes in the morning to get ready (take a shit, brush my teeth, take a shower & get dressed).\n\nFurthermore, to make my point, let's say I only ever worked 70 hours a week (I usually work more, but for arguments sake let's take the minimum). I work 5 days a week (and yes I help with the baby on weekends). That means 14 hours a day.\n\nSo 14+1+6.5+0.5. Adding up the numbers, that means I get 2 hours a day to myself. That is the MOST I can get.\n\nIn truth, on an average day, I get barely 5 mins to myself. That is because I toss and turn for the first half an hour of sleep and so I try to get to bed 30 mins beforehand, and I usually end up working around 74 hours a week (sometimes more). Not to mention what happens if I encounter bad traffic.\n\nThis isn't to mention, that when I get home, its dad mode. I have to tuck my son into bed and usually I'll play with him.\n\nI have no time...NO TIME.\n\nAll I want is 15 mins, to sit down, turn on the game I record each week, eat a warm meal and just enjoy 15 mins of peace. All I want is that, just 15 mins of peace.\n\nI don't mind cooking on the weekend, and I do cook for her on the weekend. I don't mind doing chores on the weekend (I mow the lawn on the weekends and EDIT: I also do the grocery shopping on the weekends, though she usually gives me a list). I don't mind taking care of our son on the weekends. But on a weekday, is warm dinner and 15 mins so much to ask for?", "created_utc": 1681594835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12njppk/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_cook_for_me/", "score": 840, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who gets up with the baby if needed at night? Who takes care of the baby on weekends and weekend night? \n\nFor me the only way to answer this is to find out when she gets time to decompress. Yea you are financially supporting the family, but she appears to be the default parent and handle almost all of the mental and physical tasks of the family and household. I do agree if she makes an actual dinner, as in cooking not microwaving or making a sandwich, there is no reason she can\u2019t make enough for two. I also think it\u2019s fair that you share in tasks on the weekend. You work long hours, but as the default parent, she is on 24/7. Many people believe they will have lots of time when they stay at home with a baby and quickly find out that isn\u2019t true. Yea some women seem to manage a baby and a household with precision but many don\u2019t. Post partum women also deal with hormone changes that can cause all kinds of exhaustion and potential anger. The best thing to do is open the line of communication. Find out how she is faring staying at home responsible for 2.5 of you. Perhaps discuss how a handful of nights she might actually cook and the other nights she lets you know so you can grab something on the way home. Communication is key", "NTA. It\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation when you have doubled your work load and she is making something for herself as well.", "Nta. If your working that late to provide for your wife and family expecting a meal for when you come home isn't a big ask. I completely understand that your wife may be overwhelmed with the baby but if she is making something for herself there is no excuse not to make a bit extra to set aside for you when you come home and just warm it up. Spend as much time as you can helping out when u out ate home but you took on extra work to compensate for her the be able to stay at home. She needs to compromise on this situation.", "NTA.  Being a housewife involves looking after the family, especially if you're working 70+ hours a week.", "NTA. She should be more understanding considering you put the entirety of the income on your shoulders, and are working that many hours a week.

He still helps me out when he can but I do the majority of the house work and cooking. We have a housekeeper come once a month to do deep cleans that aren\u2019t possible with a baby glued to me. Can you do something similar to take some load off of her? It\u2019s more work than you think to be with the baby 24/7. Do you help with Night Shift at all? Prob not.. she\u2019s tired too. YTA for yelling at her about it.", "NTA. She\u2019s ridiculous for saying that she isn\u2019t your maid.. You allowed this woman to quit her job to stay home and you took on extra hours to help.

Expectations not being met can make people angry but is it fair when the other person wasn't fully aware of your expectations?

She obviously doesn't seem have time, if she is the one doing laundry for her and your child, cooking for her and your child, cleaning the house and taking care of your child, and all the \"other\" chores the she clearly works more than you. Wonder if you even know what those \"other\" chores are.\n\nDo you help her clean the weekends? Do you watch the baby once you are home so she has time for herself? Do you even show love to her?\n\nShe is working 24/7 because taking care of a baby is not in the slightest cooking once or cleaning once or giving your child attention once, she is in the course of the day doing multiple chores simultaneously and it seems like the only contribution you are doing for the family is \"putting yourself in the meat-grinder\" (seriously?) and acting like another child because you need to sleep. GUESS WHAT. SHE NEEDS TO SLEEP TOO. so stop acting like a kid and maybe put yourself in her shoes one day and see how much work is she doing because you clearly are underestimating her job as a work at home mother. \n\nI just want you to know that if she starts doing your dinner and your laundry, she will be doing everything in the house, and at that point she will become a single mother.

It\u2019s unreasonable for you to expect her to do 100% of the domestic labor with an infant to care for-which is a demanding, time extensive JOB in itself.

She deserves rest as much as you do, because she\u2019s working all day too, only it\u2019s unpaid and for the family you\u2019ve chosen to make together. If she\u2019s not resting, you shouldn\u2019t be either imo. \n\nYour approach is really what made you TA for me. You sound entitled and like you\u2019re not pulling your weight to me-just providing a paycheck is not enough. Is your wife cooking herself a whole meal, or shoving whatever she can in her mouth when she has a free moment? If she\u2019s cooking anyway, you could try a more respectful approach. Example: Can you please just cook a double portion? Expecting her to cook you something fresh or different from what she\u2019s eating would not be reasonable. And if you want that, you really need to pick up more responsibility at home. Like I said, you don\u2019t just get to laze around at home while she works 24/7. Make sure she also has time to herself to de-stress. You guys need to sit down and redefine your roles and responsibilities. \n\nOr just meal prep yourself on a day off?

However, staying home all day isn't easy either. It's not like she has a lot of free time and her constant companion can't even have a conversation.  \n\nShe is earning no personal money by staying at home with your son. That can feel terrible.  She is also working hard every day, taking care of your son and home but she is not financially compensated which can create some anxiety and resentment.  Maybe she feels tired too and a little defensive.  And so she's making an issue out of dinner because she's having a bit of an identity crisis.  \n\nMy two cents:  If you don't already, start calling your paycheck, our paycheck; you get some for your personal use, she gets some for hers, and the bulk goes to the household for family expenses and savings.  Let her know much you appreciate what she is doing for your son, for you, and for the family.  Let her know you know it is not easy and that you understand she works hard too.  But logistically and due to time constraints, you need her to provide meals for you as well as herself during the week, it doesn't make her a maid, it makes her a partner.  Remember this isn't a contest about who has it worse, or who works harder. You are on the same team, you are one family.  We all want to feel valued and appreciated for the contributions we make to have a happy and healthy family.", "I do think she\u2019s a little bit of an AH for not cooking, especially if you are getting home that late.

Then when I was back at work and he picked up a few hours of overtime four days a week and I got home most days an hour or two earlier, I started dinner.  It was basic division of labor and when everyone needed to eat, it made sense for me to cook so we could eat when he walked in the door.

I was a much different cook before kids and I've had to learn the lesson I learned when I discovered breastfeeding wasn't going to work, \"fed is best\" still applies.

I find having veggies that are cut up, or cold rice I can fry up with egg or a bag of plain chicken I can add to a variety of things doesn't take long on the weekend, especially if I plan ahead and do it as I'm putting groceries away, but it helps so much.  I also would prep bags of stuff I could just dump in the crock pot like roast and veggies or chicken chili for days when dumping a bag of something in the crockpot was all I had.  \nCostco also has pretty good and reasonably healthy meals in my area that you just toss into a pan, like meat, veggies and noodles for stir-fry or taco packs.

Heck when I was still working full time as \u00e0 PA when we got the nieces I was still doing all the meal planning, grocery shopping and cooking. She can suck it up as a SAHM and do some work. Cooking and laundry should be a  minimum. You both should get some alone time and maybe that means you do more duties on the weekend and have you have a little bit of time each weeknight and give her a break on the weekend. Being a stay at home mom I think it\u2019s fait to expect to be cooked for especially when you come home so late. NTA", "You work + have a child\u2026 OPs wife is not working. She admittedly cooks, but purposely not for him. You have more than 1 child as per hour post. She has a 1 year old. He\u2019s not asking her cook for him only. She already does it.", "Babies sleep too\u2026 they aren\u2019t up 24/7. I had a colicky acid reflux baby\u2026 and was on mat leave for 5 months (you do get breaks). What became hard was when I went back to work full time remote AND take care of the baby at the same time with no help for 3 months. THAT was hard (I\u2019m a single parent with full physical and legal custody) \n\nOP is a nurse practitioner working 70 hours. People in the medical field are one of the jobs that I have no doubt has a more emotionally and physically taxing job than being SAHM or SAHD", "Seriously... I'm not sure I've ever made or even found a recipe that was a single portion. Making pasta/sauce, tacos, enchiladas, stir fry, curries? Way more effort to figure out how to make those in a one night portion.\n\nIMO if you're a SAHP, it is your job to cook most of the meals. Especially on days the breadwinner works. I would never agree to that arrangement otherwise, personally.", "I don\u2019t even know how to cook for one.  It\u2019s for 10 or none at all.", "This I agree with. It\u2019s little to minimal effort to throw in a bit extra for a few more meals.", "I'm not disagreeing with that, but it is still unreasonable to ask your SO to work 70-80 hours a week long-term to begin with. He will literally barely ever see her or his child.  So yes, she could easily add a portion to what she is cooking, but how is he going to do this for years at a time?", "I didn't say society is always correct. However, financial abuse does exist & the accusation could be made if OP followed your advice. \n\nAccusations of any form of abuse (especially if they are not justified) can easily ruin a person's reputation & life. In this case, without more info, I don't believe it would be justified for the wife to allege financial abuse.\n\nI agree that everyone who is physically & mentally able should be gainfully employed. I also believe that household chores, childcare (if applicable), & finances should be divided as equally as possible.", "It makes it even worse because she knows what it's like to go to work everyday because she used to have a job. It's obvious she has no respect for her husband", "I think a stockpile of frozen foods/crockpot dishes would go a long way for this.\n\nThis seems to be a NAH situation\u2026just a couple of exhausted people trying to make things work.", "Ahahahaha. Crackers and yogurt for dinner? Are you serious? YTA", "Sahm of 2 here. I\u2019d rather stay at home with 10 kids doing it all than working 80 hours a week.", "Ahahaha, What a joke", "I wasn't comparing, just offering workable solutions. But since you brought it up, I've been a stay at home parent, and I had 1 child before I had 2, and I think OP is being an AH. The average stay at home mom works 97 hours a week. He's pulling 80. He can handle his own food instead of yelling at her when they're both overwhelmed. Being a stay at home parent is thankless, isolating, exhausting, and relentless. I have way more free time as a single mom than I did staying at home with a baby to take care of.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/05/02/why-stay-at-home-moms-should-earn-a-115000-salary/?sh=21a0119475f4", "That's why she quit her job though? She wanted to be a SAHM, she can return to her job anytime she likes , and Op can get back to their regular hours . Simple !NTA Op", "Definitely this. Anything more labor intensive than throwing something in the microwave or 5 minutes in a pan I make enough for my whole household (3 adults) to each have at least 2 meals out of it. The economies of scale are quite steep on good cooking.", "When my husband was the breadwinner, I'd start preparing dinner at 8am.  Just little things.  Peel the potatoes and put them in the fridge in a bowl of water... later on when the kids were watching TV cut all the veggies... finally just before he came home, start putting stuff in the oven/stove.  He'd come home have a shower and bath the kids.  Then we would eat.  It wasn't difficult.", "I completely agree. Before I was a stay at home mom, I worked normal hours that got bumped up to 65 hours a week. Within a few month, I was depressed. Things got bad and I quit and my husband suggested I became a sahm. He\u2019ll probably end up depressed as well. It\u2019s not healthy to work more than 55 hours a week.", "I could argue she is financially abusing him then. She told him she will stay at home and take care of the home. He works to make up the lose of income. So he makes 2x more than he normally does and she makes zero. So if they were to divorce he would pay outrageous child support and alimony.  So OP really can do anything in this situation.", "Again, OP is on his feet for 70 hours dealing with a host of issues at work. That is not comparable to someone who is at home and can literally feed while watching tv or take a nap when the baby sleeps. My SIL just gave birth in January. She\u2019s STAHM/ wife. Doesn\u2019t work. My nephew is 4 months. She makes egg salad sandwiches. Meal preps, one pan- chicken dishes all you have to do is bake. When she can\u2019t cook they just order out. I can\u2019t imagine her making a sandwich but not making one for my brother who is working alll day too. OPs request isn\u2019t unreasonable. His wife should go back to work then and they can hire a nanny/ daycare etc. he literally putting a roof over their head and likely paying all the bills (which is ok). If she doesn\u2019t cook then she doesn\u2019t have too\u2014 but here, OP doesn\u2019t clarify what she\u2019s having for dinner.

Plus, she's at home.\nShe can sit and somewhat relax. But his 24/7 is constantly working. Plus she's already cooking a meal, why not just make him some too?

For a very long time the role of the SAHM was dismissed and not given the appreciation that it deserves, but now we\u2019ve gone into over correction, where every SAHM is a martyr and being abused by the husband as a bang maid. Both of them have jobs, hers is to handle to majority of the household, his is to work so there is a household to maintain.
