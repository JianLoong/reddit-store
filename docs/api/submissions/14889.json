In the beginning of our relationship, we were both in college and pursuing our respective degrees. After we both finished our degrees, we decided to get married and entered the workforce (I entered a year before her, as I am a year older).\n\nAfter a few years of marriage, my wife and I decided to have a baby, and we had a beautiful baby boy who is almost 1 year old now. After the baby was born, however, my wife's attitude towards her job began to change. She quickly began to loathe it and after she cried to me that she hated being away from the baby, she decided to quit her job (she consulted me on this decision ofc) and become a housewife.\n\nThe issue is, while I make a good amount of money at my job, with the added burden of a new baby, a housewife and a mortgage, I had to increase my hours.\n\nI work really late hours and I simply do not have the energy to cook myself a whole meal when I come home. I need some time to just relax before I have to put myself into the meat grinder again so we can have a roof over our heads. This came to a head a few days ago, when I came home at 9:00pm with nothing prepared for anyone (except the baby). She makes herself dinner still and we used to do our own chores when she worked, but now I have to work longer, while she has more time.\n\nWith this and tired/frustrated from work, I calmly asked if she could cook for me. She said she wasn't my maid, and to cook for myself. This turned into a huge argument and we haven't talked since. Despite the entire argument, I still think I am right here. I work my ass off day and night, put myself through hell day after day after day, working 70-80 hours a week. All I want is a warm meal when I get home and not having to do my own laundry. Now, in her defense, besides laundry, lawn-maintenance, and cooking, she does do all the other chores. She cleans the house and of course she takes care of the baby. AITA?\n\n**Edit (Someone DMed me to add this comment to my original post):**\n\nI live in San Jose, and I live about 35 minutes away from my work. That means, including the return-trip, I spend about 1 hour and 10 minutes on commute everyday (to work from home & from work to home). To make the math easy, let's round that to 1 hour.\n\nPlus, I need to sleep a minimum of 6.5 hours a night. That isn't to mention that I usually take 30 minutes in the morning to get ready (take a shit, brush my teeth, take a shower & get dressed).\n\nFurthermore, to make my point, let's say I only ever worked 70 hours a week (I usually work more, but for arguments sake let's take the minimum). I work 5 days a week (and yes I help with the baby on weekends). That means 14 hours a day.\n\nSo 14+1+6.5+0.5. Adding up the numbers, that means I get 2 hours a day to myself. That is the MOST I can get.\n\nIn truth, on an average day, I get barely 5 mins to myself. That is because I toss and turn for the first half an hour of sleep and so I try to get to bed 30 mins beforehand, and I usually end up working around 74 hours a week (sometimes more). Not to mention what happens if I encounter bad traffic.\n\nThis isn't to mention, that when I get home, its dad mode. I have to tuck my son into bed and usually I'll play with him.\n\nI have no time...NO TIME.\n\nAll I want is 15 mins, to sit down, turn on the game I record each week, eat a warm meal and just enjoy 15 mins of peace. All I want is that, just 15 mins of peace.\n\nI don't mind cooking on the weekend, and I'll even cook for her on the weekend. I don't mind doing chores on the weekend (I mow the lawn on the weekends). I don't mind taking care of our son on the weekends. But on a weekday, is warm dinner and 15 mins so much to ask for?", "created_utc": 1681594835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12njppk/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_cook_for_me/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who gets up with the baby if needed at night? Who takes care of the baby on weekends and weekend night? \n\nFor me the only way to answer this is to find out when she gets time to decompress. Yea you are financially supporting the family, but she appears to be the default parent and handle almost all of the mental and physical tasks of the family and household. I do agree if she makes an actual dinner, as in cooking not microwaving or making a sandwich, there is no reason she can\u2019t make enough for two. I also think it\u2019s fair that you share in tasks on the weekend. You work long hours, but as the default parent, she is on 24/7. Many people believe they will have lots of time when they stay at home with a baby and quickly find out that isn\u2019t true. Yea some women seem to manage a baby and a household with precision but many don\u2019t. Post partum women also deal with hormone changes that can cause all kinds of exhaustion and potential anger. The best thing to do is open the line of communication. Find out how she is faring staying at home responsible for 2.5 of you. Perhaps discuss how a handful of nights she might actually cook and the other nights she lets you know so you can grab something on the way home. Communication is key", "NTA. It\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation when you have doubled your work load and she is making something for herself as well.", "Nta. If your working that late to provide for your wife and family expecting a meal for when you come home isn't a big ask. I completely understand that your wife may be overwhelmed with the baby but if she is making something for herself there is no excuse not to make a bit extra to set aside for you when you come home and just warm it up. Spend as much time as you can helping out when u out ate home but you took on extra work to compensate for her the be able to stay at home. She needs to compromise on this situation.", "NTA.  Being a housewife involves looking after the family, especially if you're working 70+ hours a week.", "NTA. She should be more understanding considering you put the entirety of the income on your shoulders, and are working that many hours a week.

Can you do something similar to take some load off of her? It\u2019s more work than you think to be with the baby 24/7. Do you help with Night Shift at all? Prob not.. she\u2019s tired too.

She obviously doesn't seem have time, if she is the one doing laundry for her and your child, cooking for her and your child, cleaning the house and taking care of your child, and all the \"other\" chores the she clearly works more than you. Wonder if you even know what those \"other\" chores are.\n\nDo you help her clean the weekends? Do you watch the baby once you are home so she has time for herself? Do you even show love to her?\n\nShe is working 24/7 because taking care of a baby is not in the slightest cooking once or cleaning once or giving your child attention once, she is in the course of the day doing multiple chores simultaneously and it seems like the only contribution you are doing for the family is \"putting yourself in the meat-grinder\" (seriously?) and acting like another child because you need to sleep. GUESS WHAT. SHE NEEDS TO SLEEP TOO. so stop acting like a kid and maybe put yourself in her shoes one day and see how much work is she doing because you clearly are underestimating her job as a work at home mother. \n\nI just want you to know that if she starts doing your dinner and your laundry, she will be doing everything in the house, and at that point she will become a single mother.

It\u2019s unreasonable for you to expect her to do 100% of the domestic labor with an infant to care for-which is a demanding, time extensive JOB in itself.

She deserves rest as much as you do, because she\u2019s working all day too, only it\u2019s unpaid and for the family you\u2019ve chosen to make together. If she\u2019s not resting, you shouldn\u2019t be either imo. \n\nYour approach is really what made you TA for me. You sound entitled and like you\u2019re not pulling your weight to me-just providing a paycheck is not enough. Is your wife cooking herself a whole meal, or shoving whatever she can in her mouth when she has a free moment? If she\u2019s cooking anyway, you could try a more respectful approach. Example: Can you please just cook a double portion? Expecting her to cook you something fresh or different from what she\u2019s eating would not be reasonable. And if you want that, you really need to pick up more responsibility at home. Like I said, you don\u2019t just get to laze around at home while she works 24/7. Make sure she also has time to herself to de-stress. You guys need to sit down and redefine your roles and responsibilities. \n\nOr just meal prep yourself on a day off?

I work 5 days a week (and yes I help with the baby on weekends). That means 14 hours a day.\n\nSo 14+1+6.5+0.5. Adding up the numbers, that means I get 2 hours a day to myself. That is the MINIMUM.\n\nIn truth, on an average day, I get barely 5 mins to myself. That is because I toss and turn for the first half an hour of sleep and so I try to get to bed 30 mins beforehand, and I usually end up working around 74 hours a week. Not to mention what happens if I encounter bad traffic. \n\nThis isn't to mention, that when I get home, its dad mode. I have to tuck my son into bed and usually I'll play with him.\n\nI have no time...NO TIME.\n\nAll I want is 15 mins, to sit down, turn on the game I record each week, eat a warm meal and just enjoy 15 mins of peace.
