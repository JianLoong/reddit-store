I am of the view that it's responsible to see if he has sensitive skin before buying the most expensive, most difficult to obtain product (which he might be allergic to anyways) and do this carefully and that it won't harm him to do so in a careful, limited manner in order to save money on the baby products we buy for him. We aren't rich. \n\nShe's treating me like I've suggested putting his hand into a fire to see if it burns. She literally used those words. She, and her family agree that I am being ridiculously cavalier about my son's health and that if I really cared about him, I would of course only use the expensive option until he were much older.  As backstory, her family has had extensive issues with products causing hives and skin conditions, so I completely understand the caution, while my family has had zero issues as far as I know of. \n\nBut that's why I wanted to take a more rigorous approach: use a small amount of a single product, apply gently to a small area like his leg or arm and just wait and see if there's any reaction.

Slathering an adult body with expensive lotion costs a lot over time because you have to use a lot of it (because adults are big!). We used Aveeno lotions and baby bath products and you use like a quarter-size amount at a time. A bottle of lotion or hypoallergenic body wash lasts a long time. For comparison: a baby will down a container of formula in less than a week and they cost $20, but $20 worth of otion will last weeks. \n\nDrug stores like Walgreens also have periodic sales on lotions and other products. Keep an eye out for BOGO or buy one get 50% sales and stock up then.", "NAH. The desire to pre-empt allergic reactions in an infant is not unreasonable nor is gentle, controlled exposure. This is a disagreement that could be resolved by consulting the child's future pediatrician. You both have legitimate concerns and consultation with a medical professional would do much to assuage concerns. Although family history and genetics are factors in medical care, every person is a unique individual.

Testing is good, but it isn\u2019t a fix-all solution. Even if he doesn\u2019t show any signs there and then, it might come with more extensive use. Those kind of conditions are a spectrum and not always straight forward.

But I vote NTA.\n\nI can understand why your wife/her family would be sensitive to this issue. But, medically speaking, allergies aren\u2019t always something you\u2019re born with - they can also be the result of *not* being exposed to the allergen when you\u2019re young, so your immune system never trained itself to have a normal response. As long as you have infant Benadryl on hand, your approach sounds like it\u2019s actually the more responsible of the two.

It also tends to be worst for babies and then get a bit better.  Is the amount of money you\u2019ll save worth days of constant screaming and nobody getting any sleep (not to mention the neighbors\u2019 complaints if you share any walls)?\n\nI think a reasonable compromise is to go with hypoallergenic, perfume-free/dye free products until baby turns 2, then start trying cheaper products.  Perfume free tends to be the most important and hardest requirement (says the woman who reacts to many artificial scents, they\u2019re in freaking everything).

She recently got transferred to a different hospital but the old hospital used a detergent I\u2019m allergic to on all her blankets. She was fine but I\u2019d break out in a rash or hives holding her. Now that she was transferred and the new hospital only uses Tide Free & Gentle (same as at home) I\u2019ve been fine. It makes a HUGE difference for mom.", "Specifically why is 2 years the \u201creasonable compromise\u201d here? Like, medically speaking. Why 2 years as opposed to another age?", "I think that they should have in count that what can and cannot the wife can touch if they buy a product that the baby can use, but the mother going to have hives, how is she supposed to bath him etc.?", "Also you have to consider the person applying the lotion.  Well the baby might not have a reaction, your wife might.", "Cool so like are you going to apply every lotion and potion your baby needs forever? Because there's a good chance your wife will be allergic to a lot of them, even if your baby isn't. What if his skin gives her a rash? She has to be able to use them, too, you know.", "The baby aveeno lotion for eczema is what I use on my own hands when mine gets bad in the winter. And sometimes my face. It's good shit.", "Well, if skin sensitivities run in your wife's family, ask more about it. Every baby has 2 parents. Has everyone in your wife's family had babies with others who had a history of sensitive skin? Or did some of those parents come from families with no history of skin sensitivities?", "Yeah babies do wildly overreact.", "There\u2019s 2 reasons.  The first is that a child\u2019s skin becomes significantly more sturdy and less sensitive somewhere between 18-22 months.  The second is because a 2 year old can communicate more about what\u2019s wrong instead of just screaming, which lets the parents have a better idea of how to help- is it itchy, does it sting, etc.  2 years is also a nice, round, easy to remember number, which means less likelihood of either parent misremembering how many months they agreed to go before starting to patch test and try new products.", "Also, just as an aside, eucerin *works better* than the cheaper alternatives. My local dollar tree also has the travel packages of it.", "You do realise that your wife, who has sensitive WILL be using the products on your son. You should be thinking about this too, if you don\u2019t want to be the only one to be tending this type of need the baby", "Exactly. Like eliminate the stuff that the wife cannot touch and then go from there.", "Eucerin isn\u2019t cheap. \n\nThe wife\u2019s reaction would be a valid argument but it doesn\u2019t seem to be her issue. She didn\u2019t bring it up as a reason, she just accused him of being one step away from dangling the baby over the balcony.", "The small packages of eucerin are at *dollar tree* near me for goodness sakes.", "Now that is what I would call a good investment.", "4. Does he wife react to what he wants to use? I reacted to lotion I used to help my mother last time I was home. It was not fun.", "So your opinion is not actually based on any research into allergies. Interesting. I admire your confidence. \n\nThere is a general medical consensus that early exposure to allergens is better (the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d), and two years may be too late. \n\nEg: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/newborns_exposed_to_dirt_dander_and_germs_may_have_lower_allergy_and_asthma_risk#:~:text=Newborns%20exposed%20to%20household%20germs,of%20developing%20asthma%20and%20allergies.\n\nEg: https://www.jci.org/articles/view/124610", "I've never known a doctor to allergy test until kids are 4 unless they think their is a life-threatening allergy.", "Yeah if she's the one spending most of her time and performing child rearing duties and is breastfeeding - having the baby use products she's allergic to even if they don't bother the baby's skin, will absolutely leave her an uncomfortable hivey mess. My niblings use lotion and / or soap that bothers me. Even brief hugs and patty cake causes rashes and hives . Constant exposure especially skin to skin for extended periods of time like during feeding - even bottle feeds the baby's skin is touching parts of the feeding parent's arms etc. - must be so much worse", "Erm, yes, scientific-based, a baby's skin is highly absorbent since it's so thin and fragile. Not only that, it's also easier for liquids to get absorbed between their skin layers because the epidermis (the outer visible skin layer)  isn't attached so firmly to the dermis (inner skin layers) yet.\n\nEdit: typo"]}
