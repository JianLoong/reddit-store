This is likely going to be the first of many times that you are going to have to draw (and reinforce) strong boundaries with your mom and family. Decide what you're comfortable with and make a plan for how you'll enforce your boundaries (great suggestions in other comments). You do not have to explain you body issues to your family; it's your body, your choice who gets to touch you. If possible, recruit your bf's help when you're in groups to deflect people's touches away from you \n\nI say this is the first of many times because once your baby is here, people who are willing to take away your body autonomy \"because they want to be included in the experience\" or they're so excited are probably also going to be willing to ignore your authority as your baby's parent. If they're comfortable invading your personal space, touching you, \"showing you off\" and continue to get away with it, they might also feel comfortable feeding your baby things you don't want, ignoring your rules/schedule for the baby, etc. What are they going to do to your baby in the name of \"showing off\"/\"being part of the experience\"? I've heard of pushy grandparents taking away some of baby's \"firsts\" without checking with the parents (like foods, piercing ears, haircuts, special trips). The fact that she's telling you that being groped doesn't count as being groped because they're only rubbing you where she tells them to is gross when she KNOWS it is without your consent. Is any of this something you want your kid to grow up thinking is normal or okay? **Do you want your kid to just back down when they ask grandma to stop doing something that makes them uncomfortable or feel unsafe?** Start establishing your boundaries now and make it clear that your \"no\" carries weight.
