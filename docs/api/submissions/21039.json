This is likely going to be the first of many times that you are going to have to draw (and reinforce) strong boundaries with your mom and family. Decide what you're comfortable with and make a plan for how you'll enforce your boundaries (great suggestions in other comments). You do not have to explain you body issues to your family; it's your body, your choice who gets to touch you. If possible, recruit your bf's help when you're in groups to deflect people's touches away from you \n\nI say this is the first of many times because once your baby is here, people who are willing to take away your body autonomy \"because they want to be included in the experience\" or they're so excited are probably also going to be willing to ignore your authority as your baby's parent. If they're comfortable invading your personal space, touching you, \"showing you off\" and continue to get away with it, they might also feel comfortable feeding your baby things you don't want, ignoring your rules/schedule for the baby, etc. What are they going to do to your baby in the name of \"showing off\"/\"being part of the experience\"? I've heard of pushy grandparents taking away some of baby's \"firsts\" without checking with the parents (like foods, piercing ears, haircuts, special trips). The fact that she's telling you that being groped doesn't count as being groped because they're only rubbing you where she tells them to is gross when she KNOWS it is without your consent. Is any of this something you want your kid to grow up thinking is normal or okay? **Do you want your kid to just back down when they ask grandma to stop doing something that makes them uncomfortable or feel unsafe?** Start establishing your boundaries now and make it clear that your \"no\" carries weight.

Tell them their feelings are not more important than your bodily autonomy.", "NTA.\n\nMy MIL tried to touch my belly when she came over and she literally put her hand on my breast and was rubbing it. First of all, that\u2019s not my belly\u2026.\n\nSecond, she didn\u2019t even ask. I was so uncomfortable", "Definitely NTA\nYou have every right to say no to people touching you, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re pregnant they shouldn\u2019t be touching you without consent.", "NTA.  Maybe start rubbing her belly back and tell her you want to know what it\u2019ll feel like afterward?\n\nNot really. Don\u2019t do that. \n\nBut you might have to get firm. Or even mad. If she tells other people to touch your belly right in front of you, look at her directly and call it out.  \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like that.  I told you no. It\u2019s weird that you keep doing this even though I told you no.\u201d \n\nMake direct eye contact with anyone coming at you with an aggressive I dare you face and see if it doesn\u2019t stop.", "NTA\n\nWhen my friend was pregnant I literally smacked peoples hands away from her because she had said she hates being touched. Didn\u2019t matter who it was. Anyone from strangers to her own mother.", "NTA. She and other people can show how excited they are without needing to touch you or be up in your personal space. As if there\u2019s no other possible way to be excited without making you uncomfortable?? No means no, keep your paws to yourself. \n\nThey can: sing praise for you and the baby. Grab you a drink or snack so you don\u2019t have to get up. Offer to bring meals to your house. See if you need help buying baby supplies. Get you books. Share their stories and experiences. Take you for a spa day. Options for showing excitement are literally endless!", "NTA. I have never been so glad about my RBF than when I was pregnant. No one ever even tried to touch my belly, with or without permission.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nI used to reach for their bellies, whilst staring them dead in the eye,  when someone put their hands on mine. They would usually back away. I got told once \u2018stop touching me. It\u2019s weird\u2019. You can imagine my response!", "TurtleTee.com has the best shirt that\u2019s perfect for this. I wore it outside anytime I knew I\u2019d be around strangers (bc I could trust those close to me) when I was pregnant. It\u2019s got the Emperor from emperors new groove and says \u201cNO TOUCHY\u201d. \n\nSadly I think you need to wear it whenever you\u2019re near your mother. \n\nNTA. It\u2019s your body, not the babies.", "NTA. You are still a PERSON! You are NOT just a baby incubator! You still have your bodily autonomy, and it is ridiculous that she expects to not only be able to touch you whenever she wants but that she can also direct other people to touch you whenever she wants. Pregnancy is hard! I empathize with you; I struggled so much with my body changing during pregnancy. You have every right, more than every right, to feel the way you do and to say NO when people are try to rub your tummy!", "No one else has to enjoy your pregnancy but you. It\u2019s your body. If you don\u2019t want to be touched without your express permission, they have to respect that. NTA", "NTA. It is not unreasonable to not want people intimately touching you uninvited. Honestly I would just grabbed her belly rolls any time she or anyone else does it. Taste of her own medicine, ya know?", "NTA. I do not get the idea that a pregnant woman's belly somehow becomes public access. Tell anyone who tries to get near you to not touch your belly, physically remove yourself from thr area and tell them if they try, you will leave. Then Do it.  They won't stop until you force them to. You don't have to go through it just because they put up with it.", "I\u2019ve never been pregnant and have had people touch my stomach uninvited! I was in the baby section buying stuff for my sister-in-law\u2019s baby shower and some random woman just popped out of thin air, touched my stomach and asked \u201cHow far along are you?\u201d\n\nI screamed and threw the onesie I was holding in her face.\n\nI wasn\u2019t even fat back then either, I was actually recovering from a really nasty flu and hadn\u2019t been able to keep much down for 2 weeks so I was borderline underweight (168cm and only 53kg)", "Lmfao okay I know my mom is going to be handsy if/when I\u2019m pregnant, and I 100% now plan to just awkwardly cup her boobs in response \ud83e\udd23", "Wee I don't know, if they are rolling you in a blanket to smother a fire that might be different...", "This is exactly my thoughts\u2026 if OP doesn\u2019t set her boundary now, this abhorrent behaviour from her mother is going to continue in the child-rearing department.\n\nAnd \u201cI just want to be included in the experience\u201d\u2026 what the actual hell is that entitled shit? Lady, you had your experience when you had your own kids, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn, you weren\u2019t part of the baby making process, therefore no one owes you shit.", "I thought I saw one a while back that literally said \"not public property\" with a set of hands going for a belly and it had a \ud83d\udeab over it. If you can't find one I bet some tshirt printing place can. NTA", "Yea!  Wear it to the next event and then threaten to wear it every single time if she ever does it again.  The embarrassment will get to her.", "I had one that said, \"Touch the belly, lose a hand\". It was remarkably effective at keeping random people away.", "I love the use of the term \"fondle\" in this case....make it as creepy and weird for them as you can. \n\nI know there's a a lot of social expectation on pregnant peeps to permit this, but feel that society needs to stop with this assumed consent BS. Just a small piece of why so many women don't report other more aggressive forms of assault. Similarly, many adults not allowing kids to say no to hugs."]}
