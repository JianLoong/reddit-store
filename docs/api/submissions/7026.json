{"id": 7026, "submission_id": "108sbnx", "title": "AITA for letting my neighbor\u2019s daughter use my garage gym?", "selftext": "I (29 M) am a personal trainer and have a fairly large and well equipped home gym, taking up about 3 bays in a 4 car garage. The house is in a really safe area and most of the neighbors know each other. \n\nI\u2019ll usually leave the garage door open to get some air when the weather is nice. Typically neighbors will stop by for a quick chat while they\u2019re out with their dogs or walking. Because of this I\u2019ve had a few neighbors ask if they could come by and workout with me in my garage. I have no problem with this, and some of them have even become my training clients after. So it\u2019s actually been good for business. \n\nAbout 7 or 8 months ago, my neighbor\u2019s daughter Hannah (16 or 17F) walked by my garage and stopped to say hi while she was walking their dog. This happened a couple more times, then she asked if she could come by to workout too since she wants to try the sport that I do and coach (powerlifting). I said sure, as long as she asked her parents first and they\u2019re ok with it. I gave her a waiver that I have all clients or people that use my gym sign. She returned the form signed the next day. \n\nSo for the past few months she\u2019d come by a few times per week to workout. Things were going smoothly until yesterday, when her dad came barging into my garage while Hannah and I were lifting. He was yelling about how I\u2019m \u201cluring\u201d his daughter into my garage, and that I need to stay away from his family from now on. I attempted to explain the situation, but he kept yelling until he eventually grabbed Hannah by the wrist and stormed off with her. \n\nSo AITA? I can understand how it would seem problematic, but I had her ask for signed permission.  From my perspective, I\u2019m just being a good neighbor.\n\nEDITS\n\nTo my knowledge both her parents signed it, and it doesn\u2019t look forged to me. It\u2019s possible she forged it though, I\u2019m not a signature expert. \n\nVast vast majority of the time the door is open and there are other people with us.\n\nThere are also security cameras in my garage gym that everybody is aware of. \n\nI also own my own  paid public licensed training facility, which is separate from my home. I let people around me use my home gym for free.\n\n\u2014**UPDATE**\u2014\n\nI was planning on going to their house tomorrow to talk to the dad, but he actually just came by my house again tonight. He brought a case of beer over and said he was sorry for blowing up like that yesterday. \n\nSo apparently his wife signed the waiver for both him and herself when he was out of town, and just forgot to mention the arrangement. I guess they\u2019ve agreed she\u2019ll just forge his signature whenever he\u2019s away. \n\nHe had no idea she was even there, he was just walking their dog yesterday and randomly saw Hannah and I in the garage. He didn\u2019t know she comes over to workout, and he didn\u2019t know his wife knew my girlfriend. So he apologized for being a little too hotheaded, and hoped it wouldn\u2019t make things awkward between my girlfriend and his wife (they go to the same yoga class). \n\nI showed him around the garage gym and showed him the cameras. I also told him about my certifications and the public gym I own. He said he\u2019s okay with Hannah working out here, and asked if we could keep the arrangement going since she seems a lot happier lately. I said I\u2019d think about it, but both him and his wife need to actually sign the waiver this time.", "created_utc": 1673402531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108sbnx/aita_for_letting_my_neighbors_daughter_use_my/", "score": 546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You got a signed permission slip for fucks sake.", "NTA.\n\nGood idea on the waiver", "NTA but in the future, if you have minors ask to workout in your home gym, I'd speak to the parents personally first to verify it's ok. I also hope you're properly insured for this purpose, and I recommend ALWAYS leaving the garage doors open when you have minors present, and preferably another adult present. You may even want to have a camera installed to protect yourself in the case of \"he said, she said.\"", "NTA but I would 100% say for the future you need to ALWAYS ensure you directly contacted the parents for their consent.  Additionally, NEVER be in a closed area with a minor unless another adult is also there for YOUR safety.  I would also be sure the garage door is open in any case a minor is in your gym.  You did something nice, but you were also putting yourself in a very dangerous situation.", "I think it's one of those lessons you learn from and will do things differently in the future. Getting a waiver and permission is good, but maybe actually talking to the parents if under 18 is good too. To ensure that the kid didn't just sign it for the parent. \n\nWhen alone with a minor, I'd keep the garage doors open to prevent any BS accusations. I understand the concern, but it's also BS to accuse someone simply because they're an adult male, or an adult, spending alone time with a minor in a professional manor. \n\nIf the Mom signed it and agreed and he had no idea, that's not your fault. Assuming you were always appropriate with her of course. \n\nI don't think you're an AH, but as you are an adult male you need to be aware that any 1:1 time with a minor can be scrutinized.", "NTA, you've done nothing wrong. You handed out a form for her parents to sign, so if the dad wasn't aware of it, it's their family's problem.", "NTA\n\nI firmly do not believe that we should vilify men for simply interacting with children. The child is at an age where it's important to form healthy hobbies and some independence. You have other clients, the gym is in an open area and established yourself in the community.\n\nBut was the form signed by a parent? She is a minor and shouldn't be able to consent to a liability form.", "NTA. You took precautions by having a form signed. Was it signed by the other parent or potential stepparent?? That would be where the miscommunication happened. \nFor the future, I would maybe have the parent come to sign it in front of you and have the opportunity to chat with them.", "NTA but your walking a tightrope with having minors at your house waiver or not. In this day and age it\u2019s just risky.", "NTA but you kinda walked into that one. Without speaking to the dad first in person, that\u2019s a bad look.", "NAH\u2026 if you got the form signed you covered your bases. Maybe the dad could\u2019ve been nicer, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t actually get his signature, so he might be understandably freaked out by the set up.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve got that waiver for a reason.

You're being a generous neighbor and there's nothing wrong with that. Getting a waiver signed with permission is also a smart move. \nHer dad is an asshole for assuming that just because she's using this business run out of your home you're somehow luring her. \nIf I was in your position I'd consider getting cameras in the gym to prove that nothing unprofessional happens in that gym.", "NTA\n\nYou're a professional trainer and you treated her as a client. To your knowledge, she had permission from her parents. Her father tells you to stay away from his daughter... when you're in your own gym? Maybe the signatures were forged, or maybe the parents didn't know you were male. Either way, sounds like some parents are assuming you're a predator cause you're a dude.\n\nUse this as a lesson to ask to the parents for consent face-to-face in the future.", "INFO: Did she sign the waiver, or did her parents sign the waiver?", "NTA but dad might be suspecting that Hannah has feelings for you.  Might be time to back off.  She is underage.", "Ehh, u have to be careful with that age. She may have had a crush on you. Never be alone with a minor in your home.

I feel introducing yourself/going to talk to the parents and obtaining legitimate consent from them specifically would\u2019ve been the best route for you to fully protect your intentions etc here, so nothing could be misconstrued.", "NTA. You have asked for a permission form to be signed and you leave the garage door open. I would suggest that you do a copy of the form with the note attached to avoid any bad mouthing from the dad. I would probably checked also with legal requirements to protect yourself including with insurance... If you haven't already done this.", "NAH-but I can see why the dad is pissed, when you're offering home training on your own property with your own gym at your own house when it's not an official public space, it's best to truly physically talk with the parents of any underaged people interested in the gym or your services, meaning get their written AND verbal permission so they know everything that's going on.", "NAH\n\nYou covered yourself from your end by having her get written permission. You did your due diligence & it\u2019s honestly very kind of you to allow your neighbors to use your home gym. It seems like there was a serious miscommunication between the girl & her dad. Mom might have signed the form & didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Dad might be overprotective due to experiences in his own life. Definitely though don\u2019t let Hannah use the gym again unless her father specifically signs another permission form & you\u2019re able to talk to him in person.", "NTA, I agree with what someone else said about it being a perspective issue. From your perspective, you weren't doing anything wrong and were just nicely letting her use the gym. And I'm sure from your perspective, his reaction was overkill. From his perspective, he's a parent concerned about his daughter and probably trying to send you a message in an attempt to protect her.", "NAH; you had no bad intentions and asked her to sign a waiver, which she did. Not sure if the signatures were forged or not, but that's not your fault. I also understand the dad's point of view. He shouldn't have yelled at you, but he's just being protective and looking out for his young daughter", "NTA", "As a 28 year old male.

I would never put myself in a vulnerable position like that, even with her parents' permission.", "You are a trained educator. You were doing your job as a professional. This is honestly discrimination against you for being an adult male, but we're just expected to \"suck it up\" in cases like this.

You see the good in people and assumed the best, but as a business owner and these days just trying to be a good human, you should always cover your ass... yes the waiver works for adults, however having a conversation with the parents beforehand would have prevented this since she is underage. I would let them cool off then maybe try to discuss what happened. If they don't feel like discussing it then leave them alone and next time just make sure you make contact with parents directly when dealing with minors.", "Soft YTA-\n\n1. No closed doors with minors sorry not sorry \n2. Always call yo confirm signatures on waivers for minors. Why cause as a fast 15 yr old I lied through my teeth to hang out with a cute guy. Be careful man.", "ESH. You shouldn't let a minor work out with you in your garage without talking to their parents first.

All that was needed here was an adult conversation.", "YTA.\n\nTaking this post at face value, your assholery comes from a good place, but *come on*.\n\nAs an adult interacting in a private location with a minor of the opposite sex, you \\*have to\\* make sure that everyone involved is comfortable. I'm sorry, but a waiver doesn't cut it. They're your neighbor! Go knock on their door! The way you went about this looks like grooming. I'd be pissed too.", "Yes, YTA - as an adult male, you do not have any reason to be this friendly with an underage girl. As a business owner, you do not conduct business with a child, which you already know, since you require an adult\u2019s signature on a waiver. You need to require an adult to be present with the child to ensure nothing has been forged, and to ensure nothing you\u2019re doing is seen as suspicious. You didn\u2019t even kind of think this through. Do not conduct business with children. VERY simple.", "She signed a permission slip, not her parents?\n\nI \ud83e\udd14 nk that puts you into ass hole Territory.\n\nDid you leave a bay door open so that you could be seen from the street at least?", "Technically, you\u2019re not an asshole, but you ARE a dumb ass.

In some states they are invalid and she were to hurt herself you could still be liable. Secondly, a 16yo female alone with a 30yo male looks bad regardless of what is actually happening. You should have at a minimum consulted with the family before allowing her into your garage. So yeah YTA in this case. \nI also understand the minors train with athletic trainers all the time but that usually occurs in a public facility, not a garage.\n\nEdit:\nThis was posted before OP added his edits. In that case, if parents signed it, and I agree you can\u2019t be a signature expert, you would not be the AH. Would have helped had you posted all the relevant info first.", "YTA, you shouldn\u2019t have any minor over into your home several times a week without first discussing it in person with their guardians.", "YTA hopefully just naive but yeah, this comes across really creepy. You had a young girl, alone, without ever having spoke to a parent.", "YTA.  Maybe check with her parents yourself before you have private gym sessions with a teenager of the opposite sex.

I worked with a minor summer intern last summer at my job, and had to do extra state-mandated training (technically I\u2019m considered an employee of the state) about working with minors. I\u2019ve also done basically the same training a couple times because I volunteer in my church nursery. One of the biggest things emphasized in all of these trainings is that if at all possible, you should **never be alone with a minor, especially behind closed doors.** In the situation with my job, this was unavoidable sometimes but I was literally required to tell someone else where we were going and what we were doing every single time and they were supposed to come check on us if it had been more than a few minutes (but absolutely avoid it whenever possible). In the nursery situation it\u2019s just a hard and fast rule that an adult is **never** allowed to be alone with a kid, ever, and when we tell someone new about that rule we always explain that it\u2019s there to protect both the kids and them. \n\nDon\u2019t put yourself in a situation where it would be your word against theirs if an accusation was made. **Ever.** I think in this situation that also should include having the parent bring the form back and talking with them directly yourself. \n\n(P.S. I really, really care about protecting the kids, and ultimately that is my first concern in these situations, but sometimes explaining it this  way is what gets across the importance to the people who would say \u201cwell *I* would never.\u201d It\u2019s not about you.
