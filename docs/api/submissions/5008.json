{"id": 5008, "submission_id": "zot50i", "title": "AITA for sharing my salary at dinner and making my SIL cry?", "selftext": "Tonight, my fiance (26m) and I (26f) were at dinner with his family. He has a younger brother (18m) and an older sister (29f) who I will refer to as my SIL just because it's simpler. I've been working as a product manager at a big tech company since I got out of college five years ago. My salary has steadily climbed in the last couple of years so now I'm making a very large amount. However, I am a big proponent of salary transparency, especially as a woman in a male-dominated field. I've helped multiple people who were being underpaid negotiate higher salaries after sharing my salary history. I've also helped many younger college students who are looking to go into the industry by sharing my salary.\n\nSo this evening, we were discussing the tech industry and how it's become such a popular field to go into. Both me and my fiance work in tech so we were offering our input from our own roles. My fiance's little brother is planning on studying computer science in college so he asked me, rather abruptly, how much I make as a PM. Since I believe in salary transparency, I went ahead and just said, \"Well, after I got promoted to being a senior product manager a few months ago, my current salary is about $300,000.\" After I said that, my fiance's brother said \"HOLYY SHIIIIT\" really loudly and then congratulated me and called me impressive. I thanked him and told him that I'd be happy to help him when he starts looking for internships & jobs in college. However, then all of a sudden, my SIL starts sniffling and I look at her and she's wiping tears from her face. My future MIL starts to comfort her and is whispering something, and the whole table goes silent. I immediately apologize and asked what was wrong and she just said \"it's just fucking hard seeing people make that much when I'm making $15/hour working my ass off 50 hours a week.\" She also said after that \"some people really do get everything huh?\" and then glared at me and kept crying. Then she excused herself to the bathroom and my MIL followed.\n\nHere's my SIL's situation: she's currently a single mom and is pregnant with her second. She's working a minimum-wage job to support her kid. I'm very empathetic to her situation and my fiance and I have extended a helping hand multiple times (e.g., babysitting, buying her child toys/other gifts/necessities, sending money and supplies, etc.).\n\nSince the incident, she hasn't spoken to me. She actually ended up just walking out from dinner with my future MIL and leaving the rest of us at the restaurant. My MIL did text and told me that I acted insensitively and should give SIL a sincere apology. My fiance's on my side and believes his sister was the one who acted rudely. See I would apologize, but I think she owes me an apology too.

While many people choose not to share this info, you were asked, and answered. No assholes there. While we all can be sympathetic to single moms, and also with pregnant women, she is both. It is 2022, and she's 29, so I'm assuming she knows pregnancies are preventable, and they are a large part of the reason she's poor and stressed out over money. She made a choice, and the consequences of that are on her.", "NTA. Thanks for being honest about your salary. It's vital for young men and women to know what they're worth *in their respective fields* and being transparent helps close the wage gap.\n\nI do feel bad for your SIL, but she's in a different field, so she's at a different salary. If she's being paid what her position is worth, it's all good. She should ask her peers if they're also getting $15/hr. Who knows, she might be underpaid.", "NAH except for MIL. You shared and - let's be honest - you make a ridiculous amount for 5y of work experience. But: you're right to support wage transparency, it was your choice to work in this field, and I'm sure you've earned the promotions, etc. But it must be disheartening for her to know that she won't earn that, that there'll always be a difference between her and her siblings(' families) and that she won't be able to give her kids a lot, maybe not even the basics, with how it stands now. So she's no AH either for how she reacted or felt. The only AH move here is your MIL accusing you of willful insensitivity, while it clearly wasn't. Have a conversation with your SIL.", "NTA. Salary transparency is important. She\u2019s jealous and bitter about her life choices. \n\nIf you had been bragging it might have been a little different but you were asked and told the truth. \n\nEven if you had been bragging it wouldn\u2019t make you the ahole in my opinion.", "NAH \n\nYou went into a lucrative field and did well for yourself. You're not parading that around and rubbing it everyone's faces, you just answered a question honestly. You're fine. \n\nYour SIL is in an extremely difficult situation and is struggling with that emotionally. That's not your fault, and it's not her fault. It's just a fact and it hurts. I've been poor around rich people and it sucks. \n\nI think your SIL's outburst was uncomfortable for everyone, but nobody is really to blame. It would have been nice if she could control it, but obviously at that point she couldn't \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But certainly you aren't at fault.", "Nta, when i worked in science I earned a good salary but when i worked in a shop (to fit ao child care) I earned minimum wage - it is the way of the world and many people are under paid for vital work e.g. nurses but I am unsure why that would be a surprise to anyone?!  I have friends who earn crazy money but they have demanding jobs and often situations such as high risk roles e.g. finance where you are culled if not top performer; i made my life choices so while I sometimes dream of holidays and fast cars it is not their fault, Am guessing SIL is struggling and it was a bit of a wake up to alternative lives/ different choices. She still has choices but with two small children it will be that much harder - cut her some slack for hormones and some fear for where she finds herself but absolutely no guilt for yoir path and conversation as well as motivating a young man.", "NTA at all, your SIL is completely TA for making the entire night about her and victimizing herself over something that has NOTHING AT ALL to do with her. You worked hard in life to get where you are and you earn what you make. She chose to have children before she had a stable career and marriage, she cannot possibly expect everyone around her to coddle her for that. Not to mention you were literally asked, and being honest about what you earn is something your passionate about. Unbelievable your MIL is babying her like that, it's appalling that a grown woman would make a scene over what is essentially jealousy and feeling sorry for herself. Good on your fianc\u00e9 for being on your side.", "NTA, and you need your fianc\u00e9 to sort this out before she acts out at your wedding. Two ppl to straighten out: your MIL and SIL. I\u2019m sure all the tuition and studying you did came at a cost, not that you need to justify it.", "NAH, I agree with salary transparency especially given some of the practices I've seen (people on less training people on more etc), so it was fair to answer the question for the BIL.\n\nIgnore anyone saying his question was inappropriate, he's 18 and this is when he's expected to make a lot of decisions about future careers etc.\n\nHowever, it is understandable why the sister got upset hearing it. While I don't think you were an AH, to prevent this kind of issue in future if someone else enquires into your salary and it may be a sensitive topic for someone else in the room, perhaps tell the person asking that you'd love to tell them more after dinner/another time etc and talk them through not just what you're on, but how you got there.", "NTA- your fiance's little brother asked you a question and you answered frankly.  SIL's backhanded comment was uncalled for.  Call it pregnancy hormones if you wish although different fields have different salaries, education and expectations.  SIL made her choices.  If she is so unhappy with her current position, she is the only one that can change that.  She should be thankful that you are both helping her in her time of need.  With that being said and now that your salary is known; her entitlement issues may be kicking in to where she may expect more.  Just because she has a child (and another on the way) does not make you responsible for taking care of her or the kids which may explain the shade being thrown at you.  SIL needs to grow up (your MIL too) and realize that she made her bed and make the changes that she needs to support her children.", "NTA and please do not apologize for answering a question.", "no definitely NTA\n\ni commend you for what you're doing, talking about salaries and wages is important, especially with younger professionals who are just starting to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives. not only that, it seems like you've really made a difference to a lot of people by having that level of transparency. where you are now in your career is all because of you and the hard work you put into it, the time, the effort, the money, don't feel bad for how your SIL reacted just because her situation is different. \n\nbottom line is you two are living in completely different worlds even though you're so close. i think that's why she reacted the way she did, everything might have caught up to her in that moment, its not your fault, you're just trying to help your BIL.  \n\nDo i think you owe her an apology? no. do i think she owes you an apology? i mean probably for her behavior and how she acted at dinner, but not for the struggles shes dealing with. This is going to be your future family till death or divorce, so in all honesty i would apologize anyway to keep the peace and just try to talk it out", "NAH.\n\nBut lacking manners and awareness. See below\n\nShe\u2019s struggling and frustrated. \n\nYou answered a relevant question. \n\nBut OP I really didn\u2019t need the paragraph long speech about how moral you are and your salary stuff.

I don't think it's something worth getting emotional about.", "Why do people constantly have to compare themselves to people?\n\nIt's silly to compare herself to you as you've had years to work your way up to the salary, why can't she just be happy for you?\n\nNTA, you were asked a question and you answered. It's not your fault that your SIL has taken your career success to be a personal attack on her lack of career success.", "NTA\n\nYour aim wasn't to make your SIL upset.  She managed to do that herself.  You can cut her a bit of slack with her being pregnant though.\n\nI wonder whether some of why she's upset is she has suddenly realised that her sister is on good money compared to her (maybe not as high as you but she's also in the tech industry) and her brother is going into the same industry so may also earn big bucks compared to her.\n\nShe may very well feel like a failure compared to her siblings and is taking it out on you.\n\nYou had no idea what she was earning and she was the one that made a big deal about it.  You didn't go on about it.  You didn't say deliberate stuff to make her feel bad.  She's done that all by herself.  You honestly answered your future BIL's question and there's nothing to feel guilty about.  A bit of googling would've gotten the brother a ball park answer.  And he did blurt the question out.  Many people don't talk about salaries but you don't have the same hang ups.\n\nYour SIL's situation is all her own doing - it's nothing to do with you.  She's a single parent and pregnant again.  She's doing the best she can but feels the comparison.  You worked your up to get to where you are, she can so something similar.  Maybe not the same industry.  And it's harder for her, with the almost 2 kids.\n\nYou don't owe your SIL an apology like your MIL wants.  But you can apologise for unintentionally making her feel bad about her situation and that you'll do what you can to help her in her career if she ever wants to bounce some ideas off you.  It doesn't have to have anything to do with tech but whatever her dream is, it may involve going back to school.  Maybe ask her where she hopes to be in 5-10 years time.  But before you approach her, talk to your partner first and see what the best course of action is.  \n\nIs there history with the sister doing similar things ie playing the victim?", "NAH. You were honest about something that is good to be honest about. She was understandably emotional about the contrast of your success and her day-to-day struggles to keep the ship afloat despite how hard she works. \n\nI'd talk to your SIL about it but you don't owe her a \"sincere apology.\" More just that you didn't realize how your speaking about that would affect her. Maybe you can help her try to figure out a path forward career wise.", "NTA, you were just giving your BIL insight to his prospective job industry. Based on what you wrote it doesn't sound at all like you were bragging about your pay but said it in a matter of fact tone. You dont owe SIL an apology for having a conversation. What could you even say? \"Sorry I didn't get knocked up and was able to pursue a degree to get a job that pays well?\" \nNow does SIL owe you an apology....?  Yeah kinda, she was RUDE. She insinuated that you had your job and pay, simply handed to you, she doesn't know the work you've put in to get where you are.", "NTA - but maybe give a pregnant woman struggling to pay bills a break and don\u2019t bring it up again. Also maybe don\u2019t discuss your salary at a meal in front of family. You could have easily talked to him one on one later. The dinner wasn\u2019t about your salary.", "NTA.

Granted it could\u2019ve been a more private conversation but regardless she is living the effects of her own actions.

Salary transparency in the workplace is one thing. It is still poor etiquette to ask (and volunteer) salary info in a social/family setting. You should have told your BIL that you would talk to him privately later. The etiquette rule is to avoid situations exactly like what occurred. SIL was out of line to be mad at you for what you make, but even you say you\u2019re empathetic to her situation. Heeding etiquette would have avoided this.", "Technically you're in the right, but come on, you earn really a lot of money, money most people won't see in their lifetime. She's pregnant and frustrated. Give her a break. Soft YTA.", "Statistics say the biggest correlating factor with poverty in America is single parenthood.  You made your choices and she made hers.

If it was important I would find a way of making that myself! it was rude on her part. NTA", "NTA but she's pregnant, so hormones.  I'd apologize just to be nice just given that she really just broke down.  But I'm the sort of person who takes the 'making people feel better' road, you might not want to do that.", "NAH, you aren't an asshole for discussing it as long as it wasn't bragging - which I think wasn't the case here. She isn't an asshole for being stressed out by her financial situation and suddenly being reminded of it. Between pregnancy hormones and very genuine stress of her situation it probably hits her hard right now.\n\nI would talk to SIL and appologise for not realizing how sensitive a topic it is for her. Not because you were malicious, but because it did hurt her, even when you clearly didn't intend to.", "YTA. You answered a tactless 18 year-old\u2019s inappropriate question. You know that salary trans parency refers to work. You were not at work nor was this your last chance to discuss negotiation salary with said 18 year old. It was a brag and that brag highlighted class disparity and income inequality and it was a pretty rude thing to do at the dinner table; particularly knowing the financial situation of who else was around", "\nNTA at all. As another commenter said life choices. You\u2019ve also worked hard and in FANG most likely king hours too.", "NAH. If she wants to earn more then perhaps she needs to start looking for jobs that pay more. You made her choice, she made hers. A family dinner perhaps wasn't the place to discuss it though.\nEdit to add, an apology won't make her more money or make her situation any better.", "Nta it\u2019s probably just pregnancy hormones making what woulda been inside thoughts outside thoughts.", "NAH. You lack tact and she\u2019s likely hormonal.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think SIL\u2019s an AH either, just having a genuine emotional reaction.\n\nYour MIL has no right to demand you apologise for honestly answering a question her son asked you.

Something for her to work on, not for you to edit yourself in her company.", "This is exactly the situation.\n\nAlso, SIL is pregnant, so the hormones are running the institution.\n\nNAH.

She was asked a direct question and answered.", "I wouldn't say she has a history of playing the victim with me, but within her family, yes.

We don't know what her education history is, how old she is, how she got pregnant, what happened to the dad, etc. You just assume she's a single mother and so therefore this is her fault and she fucked up.  This is a ridiculous response.", "You think she's working 50 hours retail instead of in tech because she doesn't find it \"important\"? Are you serious?

I\u2019m not rich by any standards. Pretty average, but I wouldn\u2019t cry over someone else \u201cgetting everything\u201d. Actually, there\u2019s a lot of hard work involved in getting to OP\u2019s position. People don\u2019t just get there sitting on their bums. Also, for higher paying roles, usually the stakes are higher too! And the stress. Her SIL is trying to shame her for earning more and is bitter about it. That\u2019s not the attitude to have. I know plenty of single mums that hustle, work really hard. Hustle culture isn\u2019t the problem, the problem is the society we live in and that we need money in order to have anything nice, or feel comfortable\u2026 it sucks! I wish it wasn\u2019t this way. \n\nAs for money being \u201cimportant\u201d, I meant that some people really don\u2019t mind making low salaries if they enjoy what they do. E.g.

Maybe they had other setbacks. . Maybe they didn't have things handed to them on a silver platter.  I have no doubt the SIL DOES work her ass off 50 hours a week and still struggles to pay bills.

And in the last year I have leveraged my skills and knowledge to get a job making 175,000 a year- not as much as OP but life changing for myself and my family.  When I got the job offer I cried in disbelief after I got off the phone because all my hard work has finally paid off.  People in my family know and you know what? They are proud of me.  They know that I earned this, that I put in the time and effort to do better.  Even now I\u2019m trying to find new ways to increase my knowledge and my worth.  My point here is really directed to SIL who will probably never see this.  You CAN do more.  You can break out of that $15 an hour zone.  It\u2019s not going to be easy and looking back when my kids were little I struggled hard.  But it can be done.  I think more women should be transparent and celebrate their success, be a mentor to other women.
