I know that sounds weird, but as someone who also suffers from anxiety I think it's clouding your judgement in this scenario. Mainly with the fact that you can't see how he could have been joking.

My reasoning:\n\n- either it wasn\u2019t really a joke, in which case that was a sucky thing for him to say & put not just you but the other people in the convo in an uncomfortable position, OR\n- he was just joking and you are so insecure about your wedding, or so aware that it was something you did for the sake of your anxiety and not because it brought you both joy, that you got hung up over this joke. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know which but the fact that this situation is happening suggests that you two are not quite on the same page about your own wedding, which is a mutual failure of communication.", "nta, he should have respected your choices and not made jokes about something as important as your wedding. communication is key in a relationship and he should have been more considerate of your feelings.", "NTA.

Meaning, even if he had told you first, I think you still wouldn\u2019t be ok with him telling others that he regrets the style of wedding. I kind of understand that actually. It\u2019s pretty human to not want others to see cracks in a relationship or in this case, to not want people to think that untraditional was actually a bad idea or something you talked him into. It\u2019s not always easy to buck the trend and then when it doesn\u2019t work out, it can make one feel\u2026embarrassed or like it\u2019s proof you should have done what I suspect others (maybe your in laws?) may have advised you to.  I\u2019d say NAH though. He feels how he feels.

I can fully get on board with OP's husband's *place and time* for expressing his feelings about their wedding being awful, but he's not a bad or hateful person for the *feelings themselves*.", "Based on the post, I was going to say N A H, but based on your comments, it's definitely YTA. You were literally insulting the wedding you were currently attending to a group of guests. Your husband turned it back on you. You had no problem being rude to the literal hosts of the party you were at. You can't say \"man, traditional weddings like the one I'm currently benefitting from attending are so weird! I'm so happy we never did all these odd customs!\" and then expect no one to be offended. This is the kindergarten lesson of treat others how you want to be treated that you decided to ignore.\n\nYour husband may or may not wish he had a traditional wedding. Whether it was true or a joke (to play off what *you* said), is irrelevant here. He's entitled to his feelings. It's not like he said it out of the blue or aggressively. He didn't say he regretted marrying you either. The feelings he has may even fluctuate. I had an untraditional wedding too. I got married in a small state park. Not like a rentable building or anything, we used the picnic shelter as buffet space. Point being, most of the time, I'm happy with how we did it. However, sometimes I go to a bigger wedding or see pictures from someone's who I used to be close to and I feel a little sad that I'll never do that. Your husband may feel the same way. \n\nIf it's bothering you, wait until you've both calmed down and  have a conversation. Go to him in a supportive way, not an accusatory manner. Voice that you want to hear his true feelings and remain calm no matter what's said. If he's truly unhappy with your wedding, talk about if there's any way to help him feel better. Offer a vow renewal that's a little more traditional. It wouldn't have to be large, but at least include a few family members and friends. It may just be fluctuating feelings and he doesn't need a solution at all, just time to ride the waves of feelings.", "YTA based on your comments stating you made some rude remarks about his step brother\u2019s wedding and that is the actual reason your husband countered that he regretted how y\u2019all got married.", "Sounds like one of two things is true:\n\n1.

This also goes for those who were in a good financial position the first time but opted for something more laid back. This may be an option for them if he wants something more grandiose. Sometimes people say comments like this to add to the extravagance of the event they are at and in a way to pay a compliment to those getting married. Weird?
