He should have felt more comfortable voicing this to you himself but this is something he could have just realised when he was talking about his own wedding too.\n\nI\u2019m going with no assholes here because you\u2019re entitled to feel upset because you got your desired wedding but he\u2019s allowed to admit he didn\u2019t.", "NAH.

Nothing wrong with him regretting doing it that way.", "That\u2019s the shortest post ever with a TL:DR.", "YTA. Why isn't he allowed to regret having the small wedding after the fact? Maybe he regrets not having more friends and family there, maybe he regrets not having some of the wedding experiences he saw his step-brother have yesterday. That doesn't make him wrong. It makes him regret the way you did your wedding.", "INFO what did he say, exactly? I could see how that could have been a clumsy attempt to compliment the wedding you were at, but hard to say without knowing exactly what he said and how.", "NAH.\n\nAt worst he regrets the ceremony not being fancy.  He doesn't regret the marriage itself.  If it's such a sore point, you can have a formal vow renewal at some point.\n\nMy wedding was very low key while everyone else I know had much more extravagant ceremonies.  At times I do wish we'd done things a bit differently, but no wedding is perfect.  The two most lavish, well planned weddings I attended both ended in divorce.  Despite the very amateur wedding, our marriage is still going strong.  That's the important part.", "as someone who\u2019s had an untraditional wedding there\u2019s been times i\u2019ve been at a huge wedding and said or joked about missing certain parts of the \u201cbig white wedding\u201d, doesn\u2019t make my wedding any less romantic to me just thoughts.", "Based on your response explaining your anxiety, yes I think YTA. I know that sounds weird, but as someone who also suffers from anxiety I think it's clouding your judgement in this scenario. Mainly with the fact that you can't see how he could have been joking. I'm assuming he said this because he was asked a direct question regarding your wedding by one of the other guests, and not just saying he regretted it out of the blue.\n\nAs someone who also has a very dry sense of humor at times I would totally say something like 'oh yeah I definitely regret having a way smaller wedding that costed less, was way more intimate, let us spend quality time with our loved ones, and helped accommodate my wifes anxiety.

This might have genuinely been a joke! \n\nIf his tone was lighthearted, the point of the comment might really just have been to point out how incredibly lavish the wedding was by jokingly pretending \u201cwait, we could\u2019ve had THIS at our wedding?? Now I regret doing it in the living room!!\u201d\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t there; I didn\u2019t hear him. Maybe there was a little resentful edge to it; maybe he put a weird weight on it; maybe he was totally serious\u2014or maybe, even if his tone truly was jokey, it just hurt you because you already have a sense of insecurity about the lowkey non traditional wedding you had. \n\nI find myself landing on a tentative, gentle ESH. My reasoning:\n\n- either it wasn\u2019t really a joke, in which case that was a sucky thing for him to say & put not just you but the other people in the convo in an uncomfortable position, OR\n- he was just joking and you are so insecure about your wedding, or so aware that it was something you did for the sake of your anxiety and not because it brought you both joy, that you got hung up over this joke. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know which but the fact that this situation is happening suggests that you two are not quite on the same page about your own wedding, which is a mutual failure of communication.", "nta, he should have respected your choices and not made jokes about something as important as your wedding. communication is key in a relationship and he should have been more considerate of your feelings.", "NTA. His \u201cjoke\u201d wasn\u2019t funny and you are allowed to have your feelings about it. Don\u2019t let him claim it was a joke to try to tell you what feelings you can and can\u2019t have.", "NTA that wasn\u2019t a very funny or appropriate thing to joke about.\n\nEdit-Spelling", "Have him explain the joke.", "your husband's joke was definitely in poor taste. it's understandable why you would be upset and hurt by his comment. nta.", "NTA. If he has regrets he needs to actually talk to you about it like an adult rather than \"joke\" about it with other people.", "Nta, but I think a deeper conversation is needed", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if he regrets the how your wedding took place. But he should have told you that before saying it in public. \n\nSometimes we regret how we chose to do things, not that we did it. And I think that\u2019s what may be happening here. But it doesn\u2019t mean he regrets marrying you or your life together.", "nta. it's not even remotely funny to joke about regretting someone's wedding. your husband's so-called joke was insensitive and hurtful. you have every right to be upset and hurt by his thoughtless comment. communication and empathy are key in a healthy relationship and it's important for him to understand the impact of his words.", "nta. your husband's joke was completely insensitive and disrespectful. it's not something to joke about especially when it comes to something as personal and meaningful as a wedding. he needs to understand the impact of his words and apologize.", "nta. your husband's joke was completely inappropriate and hurtful. it's important to have open and honest communication in a marriage and making derogatory comments about such a special and personal event is not okay. your feelings are valid and he should apologize for his thoughtless words.", "nta. your husband's joke was insensitive and hurtful. it's important to respect and support each other's choices especially when it comes to something as personal as a wedding. his comment was unnecessary and it's understandable why you would be upset. communication is key in a relationship so it's important to have a conversation with him about how his words made you feel.", "nta - your husband's joke was insensitive and hurtful. it's understandable that you are upset and hurt by his comment especially considering the effort you put into planning your untraditional wedding. communication is key in a marriage and it's important for your husband to understand how his words can impact you. have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and hopefully he'll realize the impact of his words and apologize sincerely.", "nta. it's not a joke if it hurts your feelings. your husband needs to understand the impact of his words and be more considerate. communication is key in a healthy relationship.", "nta. your husband's joke was clearly insensitive and hurtful. it's important to respect each other's feelings especially when it comes to something as personal as your wedding. communication is key in a marriage so make sure to have an open and honest conversation with him about how his comment made you feel.", "NTA.  Ask him to explain the joke.", "that's definitely not cool of him. marriage is about respecting and supporting each other's choices especially when it comes to something as personal as your wedding. making a joke at your expense and then brushing it off as nothing is dismissive and hurtful. you have every right to be upset and hurt by his comment. nta.", "NAH.  I had cheapest wedding I could with 30 people invited (60 with plus ones).  Only a portion could come, so call it 45-50 people total.  I felt like all I did was say hi and leave.

But we\u2019re probably going small again, as in just me and him.  \n\nWe figure if we feel like we want to throw a party we will! It just might be our 5-year anniversary! But if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s cool too.\n\nI think biggest thing to me is talking to him. You can always plan a celebration if he really wants one.  But he needs to talk to you too instead of others.", "NTA", "i doubt it was a joke, but it does expose his true feelings about it. no one is the AH here.", "Then he needs to be honest and not give some sad-ass lie about how it's a joke. \n\nI'd be with you on NAH except for that. Almost anytime someone says something hurtful *and then tries to convince someone \"it's a joke,\"* it makes them an asshole. \n\nHe meant it. He told his friends. All of that is ok, and understandable. \n\nBut then his wife asks and he says it's a joke? WTF. \n\nThat makes him a spineless asshole.", "But should he have said that in front of me and all the people there??", "He said he was completely fine with it and liked the idea. It was my idea though because I have insane anxiety and stage fright.", "it was THEIR wedding HE agreed to and went along with it. He\u2019s welcome to have regrets but it\u2019s absolutely an asshole thing to express to others within earshot of your spouse without having had that conversation", "It was my idea, but he said was a good idea and that he liked it.

Maybe he did not want such a non traditional wedding. NAH though.", "Eh. You do have a bit of a point on that.", "So he can\u2019t say how he feels? \n\nI just don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole.", "He should had discussed it with his spouse before saying something shitty in front of her to others", "Do you think maybe that\u2019s why he went along with your plan? To make you feel more comfortable?", "Bullshit.", "He might not have even realized he wanted a different wedding until he went to this one and had so much fun?", "Nothing wrong with changing his mind and regretting it later. Not a big thing.", "and you never once considered that he just went along with it? you never once thought hard as to why he agreed so readily? come on, that should have been blatantly obvious back then.", "That doesn\u2019t really help clarify\u2026 do you think he regrets your wedding?", "You were badmouthing his step brothers wedding, while at his wedding, and to his guests? YTA. If I was your husband I would have regretted the wedding ceremony & marrying you. Sorry but that\u2019s just so disrespectful.", "having this new piece of information I'd say YTA and he answered the shade you were throwing the wedding you were at just right.", "I think maybe 3 things were going on.\n\n1. Your comment could\u2019ve been taken kind of critical and rude of his step brother\u2019s wedding, so he was defensive of it. It could be taken kind of like \u201cI\u2019m so glad we didn\u2019t do this.\u201d \u201cOh, I wish we did. This is very nice.\u201d \n\n2. He might\u2019ve just realized he\u2019d wish he\u2019d done this. He could\u2019ve thoroughly loved his wedding, and then seen all the fun with his family was having at step bro\u2019s wedding and thought, \u201cwish I would\u2019ve done this!\u201d Not in a hardcore, bitter regret, or anything just an offhand, oh, this would\u2019ve been cool. \n\n3. Maybe he really does regrets not doing. Make he likes the chaos and the pageantry of a big wedding and just agreed to a chill one because that\u2019s what you wanted. \n\nIn any case, expressing his feelings doesn\u2019t make him an asshole. I\u2019m sorry if you were caught of guard and your feelings were hurt, though.", "Maybe the reason he said that is because you were putting down his step brother\u2019s wedding. He might have wanted a more traditional wedding but he was willing to out that aside to make you happy. When he heard you comparing your wedding to his step brother\u2019s it might have annoyed him. How would you have felt if someone looked at the pictures of your wedding and said they were glad they opted for something more traditional? I\u2019m sure you would be insulted. Your comment wasn\u2019t appropriate.", "well see you conveniently omitted this information to make it seem like he made the comment out of nowhere. you seem to hold a low opinion of traditional weddings but just because you think some events are \u201cridiculous\u201d doesn\u2019t mean other people do. YTA for being disrespectful while still physically at someone else\u2019s wedding and he\u2019s also allowed to have regrets about how you did your wedding after the fact, it doesn\u2019t mean he regrets marrying you", "Then he\u2019s an adult, he can clearly express his feelings before the wedding \ud83e\udd14", "I don't think it's okay to say how he feels infront of me and a group of people when he hasn't talked to me about it at all. He completely blindsided me.", "I don\u2019t understand how what he said was shitty and as I said, he may have not even realized he felt that way until then.", "Maybe so, and I understand if he did, I just don't understand why he wouldn't talk to me about it before telling a group of people. I've asked him about this multiple times after the wedding and he still said he was happy with it. So it just completely shocked and embarrassed me.", "Bullshit that he should have expressed his feelings of regret to his wife before others?", "He may have not even realized it until then. He didn\u2019t say he regretted marrying you, just how you got married.", "I think you're taking this to mean more than he meant. \n\nSo he regretted the style. Wanted a first dance to be all romantic memories and whatever. \n\nNot that he regretted getting married. \n\nTalk to him.", "I think this is more about him not covering for you publicly than it is him saying it to you and others at the same time. Meaning, even if he had told you first, I think you still wouldn\u2019t be ok with him telling others that he regrets the style of wedding. I kind of understand that actually. It\u2019s pretty human to not want others to see cracks in a relationship or in this case, to not want people to think that untraditional was actually a bad idea or something you talked him into. It\u2019s not always easy to buck the trend and then when it doesn\u2019t work out, it can make one feel\u2026embarrassed or like it\u2019s proof you should have done what I suspect others (maybe your in laws?) may have advised you to.  I\u2019d say NAH though. He feels how he feels. It\u2019s not like you just got married a month ago so it\u2019s probably not a feeling that he\u2019s been stewing on.", "I do understand that you felt blindsided but I don\u2019t think that makes him an asshole.", "wrong. he is perfectly allowed to say what he feels like, because it involves himself and himself only. go with it.", "You don\u2019t need to say things just because you realize them. Not every thought you have needs to leave your mouth in the moment. \n\nSaying he regrets the wedding he had to accommodate his spouses medical needs is a shitty fucking move", "You don\u2019t understand how when standing next to his wife saying \u201cyeah I regret our wedding now\u201d is shitty? They did the wedding the way they did because his spouse has debilitating anxiety and he went and basically said \u201cwish my wife was different so we could have done this instead\u201d", "He probably just doesn\u2019t want you to feel hurt or guilty.  If he said to you, yeah I regret not having a bigger wedding and went more all out but couldn\u2019t because I know it\u2019s not what you wanted, you would be crushed and overthinking everything.  \n\nI understand why you\u2019re hurt but I can see both point of views.", "There were many other ways they could have done it to accommodate her anxiety and still done more of a \u201ctraditional\u201d thing.", "He didn\u2019t say he regretted marrying her.", "But he didn\u2019t ask for any of them he happily agreed to accommodate OP and is now shit talking that decision to others within earshot of his spouse", "No just that he regrets that she is the way she is because it meant having the wedding they did \u2026 that\u2019s fucked up", "That\u2019s SUCH a reach but ok \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "You okay man? It sounds like you're projecting a little", "It\u2019s not a reach they had the wedding they had due to the anxiety of OP. \n\nHE REGRETS THAT CEREMONY \n\nThe ceremony that accommodated his spouse", "They picked the wedding they did because the brides anxiety \n\nNow he sees his brother marrying someone who doesn\u2019t have those same anxieties and gets to have a big lavish party \n\nHe now regrets the ceremony they had that was agreed to because of his brides medical condition \n\nInstead of speaking to his wife about these feelings he\u2019s having he makes a joke about regretting his wedding in front of his wife who has no idea \n\nThat\u2019s an asshole move I\u2019m not sure what I have projected onto the situation that wasn\u2019t discussed in the post or the comments by OP", "And there are plenty of other way they could have accommodated her and done something more \u201ctraditional\u201d like. But you have CLEARLY made up your mind that he\u2019s a horrible human being so.", "And? That's not awful in and of itself. I won't be having anything like the wedding of my dreams because of a medical accommodation. I've lost a lot of money on booking fees and the venues I'm now able to select from are frankly making me sad to think about.\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't love my partner or that I think less of them. They're still the only person I want to spend my life with, I'm just having to adjust my desires for *how* we celebrate that happening. I would say the difference here is that my fiance and I are very open about this and we check in with one another's feelings about it.\n\nI wouldn't want to surprise them with my emotions about it and I wouldn't appreciate it if they did that to me, especially in a public setting. I can fully get on board with OP's husband's *place and time* for expressing his feelings about their wedding being awful, but he's not a bad or hateful person for the *feelings themselves*."]}
