{"id": 27619, "submission_id": "16s353c", "title": "AITA For Asking Someone Why They Expected Gluten Free Options At A Bread Bakery?", "selftext": "So I (23F) recently hung out with my boyfriend Jason (25M) and some of his friends from college: Hana (25F), Mike (25M), and Rickie (26M). For some additional context, Rickie and Hana began dating shortly after college, and Hana has Celiac Disease.  Also, I recently moved in with Jason, resulting in me needing to find a new job.\n\nWhile we were all hanging out, Jason's friends asked some questions to get to know me, and upon learning I had to move so far that I needed to change jobs, they asked where I was applying. I mentioned a cafe/bakery that's gotten in touch with me so far and that I have an upcoming interview. I said I really loved the atmosphere as a customer, and I want to work for someplace that is local rather than a chain and prioritizes quality, which this place definitely does. She scoffed and said it's a bad business and I should probably just forego the interview since it's not a company worth working for. Rickie agreed, calling it a shit place. I asked what was wrong, fearing there were some serious problems I didn't know about, only for Hana to complain that there were no Gluten Free food options. This confused me, which I expressed, asking why she expected GF option at a bread bakery. She said \"what, just because they sell bread they can't put in a little extra effort to cater to gluten intolerant customers?\" \n\nThis might be where I fucked up. I responded that, *yes,* that's the case. What I didn't say, but assumed went without saying, was that majority of the facility is literally used to make various breads/rolls/etc and other flour-inclusive pastries, and the remainder of the facility is used to process, prepare, handle, or advertise the sale of these products. Literally their whole thing is that they bake their own breads, have their own recipes, everything is from scratch and the wheat for the flour is provided by a family-owned wheat farm. *Everything* they sell is or involves their house-made bread products and other baked goods except for the coffee, tea, and maybe their soups? But I also don't know if they use flour to thicken those, and even if they don't, by nature of the operations in the cafe/bakery, there's flour everywhere. It honestly felt like hearing someone with a peanut allergy complain about the offerings at a nut store or something. It made zero sense to me.\n\nApparently, the was I responded really offended Hana. She spluttered something about me being an asshole who thinks people with dietary needs should just suck it up, get sick, or die, then grabbed Rickie's arm and pulled him out of the restaurant. Things have been awkward to hostile since then; my boyfriend agrees with me, but says I could've handled it better pr just shut my mouth entirely, Mike has been staying out of it, Rickie is pissed that I \"insulted his girlfriend\", and Hana has been finding me on social media and harassing me in comment sections and my DMs. Was I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1695674134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s353c/aita_for_asking_someone_why_they_expected_gluten/", "score": 958, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rickie agreed, calling it a shit place.\"\n\n\\^ that is a weirdly aggressive response for an establishment that doesn't offer gluten free products, because while offering GF products has certainly become more common, it's absolutely not the norm. And a bakery doesn't need to cater to the GF community if they are having success without doing so. I find their response to just be so off putting. In my life I have dealt with a variety of dietary restrictions and have never once had this attitude. In fact - this girl should get a little lesson on what it was like in 2003, it was nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find anything gluten free at an establishment. Everything had to be made at home. \n\nI don't even think your response is that bad, now of course your tone could have set the stage here. But I don't understand how she could take personal offense with your actual response. Her DMing you and harassing you is so intense. Like she's just looking to create a problem at this point.", "NTA.  Not every place is going to be to cater to every situation.  Unless they advertised having gluten free options - and then did not - I do not at all see a problem here.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine a way to prevent cross-contamination of the wheat in the same kitchen, let alone using the same equipment. \n\nCould they buy and stock a few sealed things from a local GF bakery? Sure. But, they can\u2019t plausibly make both in the same space and have it be safe for her.", "NTA.\n\nLordy! That they found the place to be problematic over non gluten is WILD! \n\n\"It honestly felt like hearing someone with a peanut allergy complain about the offerings at a nut store or something. It made zero sense to me.\" - agree.\n\nYour BF sucks for sitting there while they pile on a place you want to work. Hana is a bad piece of work.", "NTA. They don't seem to understand what happens with flour in a kitchen, do they?", "NTA Expecting gluten-free options there is like expecting unicorns in your backyard. Hana's entitled attitude is beyond ridiculous, and her harassment is uncalled for. You were just stating the obvious", "NTA. I'm imagining Hana going on Yelp and giving one-star reviews to every place that doesn't offer gluten-free options.", "Nta. Not every business needs to cater to everyone and you\u2019re right that if your whole thing is wheat you\u2019re going to have a very hard time avoiding contamination. Better to be home about what you do.", "NTA,  \nA bakery is free to not offer gluten free products. If you dislike a bakery because of it, simple solution do not shop from there. \n\n>said it's a bad business and I should probably just forego the interview since it's not a company worth working for. Rickie agreed, calling it a shit place. \n\nBad mouthing a place just because they are not producing gluten free bread is ridiculous. You just gave her a piece of reality and it seems she didn't liked it. There were no insults, she was delulu for thinking if a place has no gluten-free options they are basically trying to say \"people with dietary needs should just suck it up, get sick, or die\"", "NTA. Block her on social media.  You don't need someone that hypersensitive around.", "NTA. To cater someone that\u2019s GF at a bakery that is not dedicated to it is practically impossible. Some folks can can have huge reactions over a tiny amount of gluten. If they\u2019re only making breads in house, the amount of risk of cross contamination is incredible and that can mean legal issues.", "NTA. Sure it would be nice if they had some gluten free options, but a business is not required to cater to every dietary restriction of everybody.", "NTA. \n\ngranted you could have phrased it better but they are simply over reacting at this moment. your BF is standing up to you as well. coming to hana hounding you on social media, just block her. she sounds like a tried delight to not be around.", "NTA. Having gluten free options is a nice thing to have imo, rather than a natural expectation of a bakery.\n\nYou may be naive but NTA for asking that question. \n\nHer sentiment is like saying a steakhouse is bad because they don't offer plant-based meat options. Sure you can want those options and choose to not frequent there if they don't, but to make them out as an evil entity is a bit self-centered.", "NTA. There is no way in hell that I would ever buy anything GF for a Celiac in a regular bakery because the likelihood of it being cross contaminated is very high. I would only ever purchase GF products for a person with Celiac disease from a dedicated GF bakery.", "What an odd conversation - NTA.   \n\n\nYour friends are unable differentiate what might make a good place to eat vs. a good place to work. Personally I\u2019d be more concerned about the personality of the owner as that is what will drive the employee experience. The other key point is a corporate outfit might not have as good a menu but MAY have better benefits.", "NTA though I do think your delivery left something to be desired. \n\nGF bakeries exist but I rarely if ever see a bakery have both actually, presumably because of the specialization and separation required to have wheat products alongside GF one. It seems ridiculous to disparage a bakery as 'bad business' because it's not a *GF bakery specifically.* And not all dietary restrictions are going to be accommodated by all businesses - as a vegetarian I don't write off the butcher shop in town as a bad business, it just isn't one I visit or give any business to. \n\nBut I do think her words were coming from a defensive and perhaps frustrated position relating to the difficulty of finding GF options, and I think you definitely could have replied in a kinder tone. Do some damage control - tell her you didn't mean to be dismissive, you were  surprised to hear the place described as a bad business just because their model doesn't really allow them to offer GF options. Hopefully she lets it go but if she doesn't, at least you'll know you did your part to preserve the peace in the group.", "NTA\n\nNot offering gluten free foods is a business choice. It doesn't make them horrible, though it may limit some of their sales.", "NTA. I would've said, \"So just don't eat there. Doesn't mean I can't get a job there. If you don't want to interact with me because I'm around flour all day I'm cool with that.\"", "NTA - There are a lot of people in the world with dietary restrictions due to their health issues (I'm diabetic myself). It is up to those individuals to police their own diet, and not neg on every place that does not cater to their needs or demands. Hana can shop and work where she wants to, and you have the freedom to do the same. Hana cannot restrict your life, as you do not restrict hers.  I am sorry that she has health issues, but she is the AH here.", "You were NTA.  You pointed out the truth.  Unfortunately some people still believe that the sun should revolve around them.  Yes good intolerance issues are serious but every business is not expected to cater for every single one.", "NTA \n\nIf the place is how you described, it would be incredibly difficult and expensive for them to ensure zero cross contamination. \n\nSome places simply cannot cater to celiacs. There are plenty of places that do. No need to go on a crusade against the ones that genuinely can't.", "I can\u2019t believe adults seek out others on social media to harrs them like Hana is doing to you. Nasty behaviour.\n\nMaybe your tone was a bit off, but why would a celiac think a bakery full of cross contamination should make GF products? Why even risk it? Huge sense of entitlement here. NTA", "NTA. Sheesh. I'm guessing these people aren't even celiac. I've never met someone with a legit gluten allergy or celiac disease that gets angry at no GF options. It's always the trendy white girls who decide one day they can't eat gluten and expect the world the cater to them.", "Her demands are like asking as seafood restaurant not to serve shellfish.", "NTA, there is flour dust in the air everywhere. That will get in everything. You would need a separate kitchen for this. And those bakeries that promote in-house gluten- free option, I would be very skeptical about it. An extreme example of this are those kosher delis/restaurants. They literally have two of everything and have separate kitchens for this. That\u2019s why they are not cheap.", "Remember Demi Lovato Complaining about that froyo store some time ago? I don't know why this gave me those vibes. NTA.", "NTA\n\nNot every restaurant can or wants to cater to every possible person's wants or needs, especially stuff that is very specific.  Most steakhouses or BBQ restaurants don't have a vegan menu... that's not their business, and it doesn't need to be.  There are plenty of other bakeries and restaurants that have gluten free food.\n\nAlso, anyone who stoops to the level of harrassing people in the comments of their social media is by definition a lame loser.", "NTA, to be true gluten free they need a separate kitchen to avoid cross contamination.  I have food allergies that are worse than gluten intolerance, like having to have a tube down my throat to breath. I do not demand or even expect every single eatery in the world to meet what my needs are.  There are place I avoid and places I can go to.", "My daughter is allergic to peanuts and pumpkin, does that mean every Thai restaurant in the world is a shit place??\n\nNta", "NTA. It doesn't make sense. It is impossible to bake gluten free in a regular bakery. I love to bake and when I have to do a mixture of gluten and GF, the GF gets done first, in a clean kitchen with dishwasher cleaned utensils and then gets placed in a separate closed container away from any other baking I do. I don't see this happening in a bakery.", "NTA. Your analogy about the nut store is spot on. She was being completely unreasonable and now she's even harassing you. She's TA.", "NTA\n\nGF isn't come protected class of people. Maybe ask what they do for a living or what products they buy and say the companies are no good. Early 20s are a time when many people don't realize their opinions stink.", "NTA. A bakery cannot produce gluten free alternatives, they can make them without gluten but they can't protect against cross contamination. I'm surprised Hana doesn't know this. If she has celiac, rather than a sensitivity, I'm doubly surprised.", "NTA.  Report Hana on every sm site she's harassing you from and dump her and Ricky right out of your life.", "It is amazing how many people will take being made to feel stupid as a personal attack. NTA.", "To me, this is like a vegan going to a steakhouse", "Nta.\n\n\nAnyone that has special dietary needs needs to understand not every damn place is going to cater to them. And anyone that has a gluten allergy thinking anything that is made around bread is safe is an idiot", "Nope a celiac wouldn\u2019t normally want to risk a product from a regular bakery even if it was made with gf ingredients just because of the risk of cross contamination. Likewise, my husband is severely allergic to fish and doesn\u2019t risk going to a sushi restaurant to eat an avocado roll even knowing it doesn\u2019t technically contain fish.", "Block that person. I think you made a point and she can\u2019t accept it so she\u2019s harassing you even in social media.", "MTA I sometimes wonder if people are actually allergic to gluten as much as they say they are allergic to gluten or if it's some trendy Tick Tock fad that they are going through.", "NTA. I don't know why so many gluten-free people need to be as aggressive as vegans, but for some reason they do.\n\nI mean, most people with food allergies understand that shit happens and it's not everyone else's job to cater to you. It's not as if people with shellfish allergies are always bitching about seafood restaurants, they just don't go there.", "NTA. Hana imputed all kinds of beliefs to you that you never expressed. Though you could have gone further to explain why you thought offering gluten-free products wasn't practical, she was in the wrong for attacking you based on your opinion. And she and Rick started it all off by disparaging a bakery that you wanted to work at.", ">Hana has Celiac Disease\n\nI highly doubt that. Intoleranz at best. Attention seaker at worst. \n\nA friend of mine has it and he can't eat out atball because they can't  guarantee that there is no Gluten in the kitchen. \n\nHanna has no knowledge about how any of that works so either she is faking or a moron. \n\nYou are NTA and should consider a change of friends.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.", " NTA", "NTA. My daughter has a peanut allergy and I have a gluten intolerance, so I get how annoying it is for both sides, but you can choose not to go somewhere.  \n\nSome bakers do offer GF and vegan and that's great, but it's not required. She's incredibly entitled to go around bad-mouthing a local spot simply because they don't cater to mommy's precious baby. \n\nThey were the ones that should not have said anything when you were talking about job opportunities. They decided to voice their biased and ridiculous opinions and you responded. Your bf is wrong to chastise you for that.", "NTA. My spouse has celiac. Sometimes I like to stop at places that have no GF options on their menus. She\u2019ll either go get something else before/after, or wait until we get home to eat. She knows not everywhere is going to have something she can eat, that\u2019s just the way it is.", "Most bakeries offer something gluten free. Just like coffee shops offer tea and almond/soy milk options and burger joints have a chicken patty option (or a fake vegan burger patty substitute)\nIt isn\u2019t wring to ask. \nIt isn\u2019t wrong to be surprised and disappointed that a store is not willing to keep up with the times", "Sometimes you don't expect GF options, but you do expect to be treated kindly if you ask.\n\nI went into a new cupcake shop called \"Wild Flours\" to see if they had GF cupcakes (the name seemed like maybe they did wheat alternatives, right?). The lady behind the counter snarled \"If I had a nickel for everyone who asked that...\" Ya know what? I didn't mention that it sounds like she might have a few nickels if she'd stocked some GF products...but if she'd been kind about her \"no\", I wouldn't be recalling our encounter here. Or on Yelp. Or to anyone who would listen. Since she was so nasty about it, it didn't hurt my feelings at all to see that shop closed in a few months.\n\nSo if Hana had a nasty encounter when she inquired, maybe there's more to them being a shit place than the fact that they don't carry any GF products.\n\nI'm offering this because the story sounds fishy to me. I have to eat gluten-free, and you get so accustomed to places not offering GF alternatives that you couldn't possibly maintain animus toward all of them.", "Soft NTA generally someone with celiac shouldn\u2019t be buying from a place that uses regular flour unless they have some strict af protocols for their bakery. So the premise is correct but maybe the delivery was a bit blunt for her.", "[deleted]", "A6", "NTA, but I think you sent about it completely wrong.  You could have said, \u201cthere is no way a small bread bakery could SAFELY make gluten free products without risking cross contamination solely due to the fact that bread flour gets in the air every time to is used.  A company would have to be big enough and have enough public support to finance a completely separate air handling system for a separate room with entirely separate equipment and all that equipment or the risk to anyone gluten intolerant would not be acceptable.", "Wow, in my city, restaurants AND bakeries have gluten-free products that they either make or purchase from an offsite facility in order to be able to serve all their customers. Many people have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant.", "Um. Because it\u2019s a bakery and bakeries are where almost all gluten-free bread gets made, so\u2026..", "ESH\n\nNowadays almost every bakery has GF options, it\u2019s so common that it\u2019s ridiculous to think that they wouldn\u2019t, but the way everyone reacted to this argument was extreme so nobody is in the right here", "YTA or just naive. They have gluten free flour. A bakery can definitely make a couple items for the GF crowd.", "NTA, but geez, learn how to react better. \n\nGluten-free bread is actually a thing, you know.  You could have acknowledged her concerns and feelings instead of getting all eye roll-y and snarky.

Bakery-stuff is (next to pasta maybe) the main food you want gluten free options of so you can still eat it.

Nothing too crazy to expect.", "YTA.  It's routine for artisan bakeries to produce or buy in gluten-free options.  Not that difficult to keep the GF stuff separate.  It's a reasonable expectation.
