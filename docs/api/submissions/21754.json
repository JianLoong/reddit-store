The next day, we found out that his mistress and his 5 ducklings' bought matching dresses and my father didn't wear his Kurta the day before because he wanted to wear them on this day to match with his loving second family.\n\nA month ago, I bought a house with my own hard earned money and I threw a housewarming party.

Honestly, I think it is OK to cut your Dad out unless there is a cultural reason you need him in your life... I know some cultures require women to have male guardians so if that is the case then that sucks, but if not... ask yourself if you really need him. Live your own life and if your mom sends money have her send it to you directly, and make sure there is a room for her to come back to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are they your half sisters though if he married his second wife after he was with your mom?
