Very irresponsible ahole move to have done that.\n\nYour wife for getting so drunk, she is still out of it the next morning, when it's her responsibility look after her own kid.

On a high shelf i doubt it.\n\nYou know you messed up because you left glass and pills where your son could reach and also because your wife was still asleep.\n\nYour wife messed up because she was so drunk that she couldn't wake up when you tried (once?) and because she expected you to skip work because she drank too much.\n\nI wonder what your son did (broke, hurt himself and cried so loud) that made your wife to wake up. Or maybe he spilled water on her.\n\nEither way you 2 must talk about your mistakes and sort this stuff out", "ESH. You needed to wake her up before you left your child alone and unattended!", "You're both TA here!! You shouldn't leave your child with a sleeping person when they can get into things while the person sleeps! Especially when you don't know that crying or crashing would even wake her! The kid could knock over something and get hurt! Maybe even get to the pills you left or your wife and then what? He lays on the floor in a puddle of vomit and unable to breath. Yeah, sounds like a grand plan. Even if you put them out of reach, there's always some way little ones can somehow hurt themselves. \n\nYour wife is TA as well because she drank knowing she would have to watch your son in the morning and that was incredibly irresponsible to do! Especially to expect you to call off work on short notice. Did you guys just not communicate about that the night before while she was sober or what?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was expecting you to not be TA because you didn\u2019t want to take a day off work when your wife was hungover, but then you left your 20 month old with a sleeping adult. My daughter is 21 months old and if my husband left her on our bed without actually waking me-I would murder him. She is very active and our room is unsafe for her to be there unsupervised.", "ESH you really needed to try harder to get her awake, then feel free to be mad that she caused you to be late/absent for work, but leaving a kid with an unconscious parent who isn't wakable? That's a hell no from me", "NTA. She's got a lot of nerve not to mention the child that she's responsible for.  Not saying she shouldn't have a night off or have a good time but she can't expect you to take off work so she can sleep off a hangover.  Welcome to parenthood where you have to take care of your children whether you're sick, hungover or just don't feel like it.", "Parenting 101 never drink that much on a school night...", "INFO: do you want to be right? Or do you want your kid to be safe?", "NTA.  Your wife is a \"top parent\" for going out drinking late knowing she was responsible for taking care of her child the next morning.  It isnt reasonable for her to expect you to call in sick/take a day off work without notice, because SHE CHOSE TO GET DRUNK.   Being a good parent isnt a 9-5 job, it is 24 hr 7 days a weeks and often requires sacrifice and maintaining sobriety.", "ESH you should have woken her up before you left and not left pills in reach of your unsupervised 2yo", "ESH: Your both at fault you should t of left your baby alone and your wife is a giant AH for getting drunk knowing you had work the next day.", "You should not do it. I am not sure what are you trying to proof, but your son could have been injured in so many ways. Starting from pills to oven to climbing up.. \nyou should have woken her up and make sure she is sober enough to watch him.\nShe should not be drinking that much before, but it doesn\u2019t make you right.\n\nPlease be parents.

It's unreasonable to expect you to take a day off because she drank too much to get up the next morning.", "Holy hell, this can't be real. You left your 20 month old with a passed out inebriated person while also leaving pills out. What is wrong with you that you think this is acceptable. Was she in the wrong yes, but that doesn't negate you from the blame. This is the type of shot that gets your kids taken away.", "You especially don't leave tablets out in the same room.

He was trying to go work to support family\n\nHowever if you can't wake your wife, it is irresponsible to leave. Call in work say wife sick, need to take care son....\n\nShe could have passed out 3 hours with him crying there, opening a window, anything could happen", "This you don't just expect your OH take the day off because you couldn't control yourself and get wasted and can't take care of your child. I'm sure on the other foot she'd tell him where to go.\n\nAlso don't leave a child with a sleeping adult with tablets loose around them. You make sure the other adult is awake.", "I mean, calling off because your wife is too hungover to watch the kid is pretty much calling off hungover yourself.  Entirely preventable.

If those were Tylenol for example it might well have been enough to overdose a not even two year old and that is a bad way to die.
