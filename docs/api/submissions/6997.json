I was kind of taken aback by this isn't a normal thing my girlfriend would say. So I asked why? She said because it's something she would like me to do, her sisters husband did it, and some wedding funding from him would likely be contingent on me doing this.\n\nI came back with that I wouldn't be asking another person person for permission to marry her. It's an extremely outdated tradition for one, and I'm a 30 year old person, I can do what I want to do with someone I love. I don't need anyone else's permission.\n\nShe got mad and said I just needed to do it, because it's a small thing to ask for, and she wants some of the money to have a few more things at our wedding that we won't be able to afford without it.\n\nI'm continuing to stand my ground about not asking for this.

I completely understand your side, and logically it doesn't make sense to ask for permission. \n\nHowever, not everything about relationships is logical. Especially with religious/conservative parents. I grew up in a religious family so I can understand where she might be coming from, but it may be a way for her to feel like you are being fully welcomed in the family. It's a verbal approval from her father that he is okay with you marrying her, and honestly parental approval is always craved, especially in households where it isn't always given. \n\nIt could also be a way for her to try to maintain some semblance of a relationship with her parents (ie an olive branch) especially if things are strained due to political differences. \n\nAlso if her parents will contribute more money this way, she could be looking forward to a dream wedding that needs extra funds. \n\nWhen my aunt got married, her husband just had a simple conversation with my grandfather. More of like a \"I am planning on asking your daughter to marry me, and I wanted to let you know, man to man\" kinda thing.

It's not like you'll truly go, \"Oh shit, we can't do it!\" if he says no.

It implies ownership and that she doesn\u2019t have any agency or ownership of herself.

Luckily my FIL is the absolute bomb, and did not care.", "NAH\n\nListen, you are a team and you are looking to go official with this team-up. A successful long-term relationship means working out which weird idiosyncrasies you both can live with and which you need need to find compromises on. \n\nEverything about a wedding is symbolic except the paperwork you sign with the government. Every step is a ritual or decision you make based on your personal values, culture, and budget. A lot of them may be rooted in questionable historic norms. \n\nThis is something that matters to your partner and that squicks you out. But the fact that you are even playing along with the idea that the man proposes in some formal way and the woman then decides if she's up for it instead of you both just saying, ''hey, let's get hitched,\" means you're already playing the game. How far you want to take the old timey cosplay is up to you both. The fact that it might mean some extra money for your party may be reason enough to play along.\n\nYou may also ask her what she's going to do if her father says no, he doesn't approve. Is she really committed to this formality or is she really just looking for you to play along, with the hope of a payout? It sounds like it's more pragmatic than sentimental for your partner.", "NAH. I completely understand why you feel weird about it, but I also understand her reasoning. It seems she doesn\u2019t care that much, but it would help both your relationships with her family and guarantee some funding for the wedding. \n\nAs I woman I also feel icky about this tradition. My partner is fairly traditional, and we both knew my dad would be hurt if he wasn\u2019t given the heads up. So instead he \u201casked his opinion\u201d about the ring. \n\nWould it help you to phrase it as asking for their blessing instead of permission? You could also ask her parents and sister for their blessing at the same time so it\u2019s less of \u201casking a man for his woman property\u201d and more so \u201cI would love to be a part of your family.\u201d", "What happens if you don\u2019t ask her dad?

It\u2019s a sexist and outdated tradition and frankly I\u2019d be pissed if my partner asked my father permission to marry me. Gives me the ick.\n\nBut your girlfriend has made her wishes clear and blatantly refusing to follow them isn\u2019t great. There\u2019s also the practical point of finances. Taking the moral high ground is great and all, but at the end of the day both you and your girlfriend know that her dad has no right to give her to you or keep you from her. She knows doing this will allow you to have the wedding you want or save for future things together, and that\u2019s not nothing.\n\nAs others have suggested, I would do a middle ground of letting her father know your intentions. Being respectful as you can, bring him a cigar or bottle of wine or whatever and have a conversation about how you love his daughter and your plan to propose. For most people I think this would count as asking for his blessing.", "NAH...I would ask a series of follow up questions to my girlfriend. About kids, about the place of religion in our marriage.

I was kind of taken aback by this isn't a normal thing my girlfriend would say. So I asked why? She said because it's something she would like me to do, her sisters husband did it, and some wedding funding from him would likely be contingent on me doing this.\n\nI came back with that I wouldn't be asking another person person for permission to marry her. It's an extremely outdated tradition for one, and I'm a 30 year old person, I can do what I want to do with someone I love. I don't need anyone else's permission.\n\nShe got mad and said I just needed to do it, because it's a small thing to ask for, and she wants some of the money to have a few more things at our wedding that we won't be able to afford without it.\n\nI'm continuing to stand my ground about not asking for this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "My BIL asked my Dad's permission to marry my sister.\nFor some reason, probably to do with a noisy home, my Dad thought he asked for a bottle of Guinness and said, yeah, help yourself......\nMy parents and my sister are no longer alive but when reminded of it, like now, it still makes me chuckle\ud83d\ude03", "No vote, but what if you think of it more as informing both of her parents that you are proposing and ask for their blessing? I also find the \"asking for permission\" weird, but find asking for their blessing to be less weird.", "Her reasons are \"He'll give us money\" and \"I want you to be like my sisters' husbands!\" Those would make me stop and raise my eyebrow. They are definitely NOT good enough reasons to maintain pointless, sexist traditions.\n\nWhat else is she going to want you to pretend to be or do to get money from Daddy? What else is she going to want you to do or be to match her sisters' husbands? I don't presume to know enough about you two to have advice for the long term, but in the short term, do not bend on this issue, and get some answers about how far such reasoning will go.", "My family is pretty traditional, but by the time I got married, I had been living on my own for years.  My husband decided to go a middle road. He called my parents before he proposed and asked for their blessing (not permission). I thought that was a good way to go about it, since I don't need my parents' permission for anything as an adult, but he was still respectful of their wishes to be asked.", "NTA. \n\nYou're the one proposing. So you get to decide how and when that's done. If she wants to propose to you and ask your parents for permission, she can do that. If she wants more things for her wedding, then she should save up for that rather than pandering to her father for some pennies. \n\nGrown ups shouldn't be relying on other's funding their wedding day. It would be a kind donation, but certainly shouldn't be counted on. \n\nYou have the right to not want to propose in a way that makes you uncomfortable. And by the lack of explanation other than 'I want my daddy's money', it sounds like your girlfriend wouldn't actually care about it otherwise.", "YTA. It's important to her. \n\n My partner's in the same boat as you he views it as a dumb tradition. \n\nHowever, he knows it will make me happy if he let's my father know and asks for his blessing because it means a lot to me.\n\nIt isn't trading property, handing me off to my partner  or any of that. It's the affirmation that my parents like him/ accept him enough to intertwine families and call him one of us. \n\nTraditions can be adapted into new meanings and actions.", "NAH. I understand and it's not something I would like doing either but here's the thing, the idea of asking for permission for marriage is wrong in that it treats your girlfriend like property. She should be the one offended by it but in this case she's asking you to do it so she's weighed the benefits and seems willing to have come to the conclusion that it's more good than harm. She probably has no doubt he'll say yes and that you don't see her as property, so she sees no harm in the gesture. Do you expect that if he says no, your girlfriend will just accept that and not marry you? Try using wording like blessing instead of permission or just say something like \"I'd like to ask girlfriend to marry me.\" and let him come to the conclusion that you've asked his permission without actually asking.", "Kinda YTA. Not for not liking this tradition, it's your right, but for being judgemental over this. Some people like old fashioned tradition, and if she asks for it, yes it's something normal for her. I get that you don't like it, it's your right, but honestly it's not like it was something painful or degrading for you. it's a simple thing, do it in a modern and fun way and it will be over before you understand it.\n\nAnd don't say it's outdated. You're entering the family officially. Don't start on such poor note.", "NTA\n\nYour gf just wants the money that's all and she knows you have to ask to do that. \n\nSay fine if you ask my parents if you can have permission to have a baby with you.", "NAH. I agree while it\u2019s a totally outdated tradition, since your girlfriend says she would like you to, a compromise is in order.\n\nUnbeknownst to me at the time, my now-husband basically called my dad, took him out for some whiskey (a shared interest) and basically let him know he was going to propose. My dad appreciated it and they had a nice time. There was no \u201casking for permission\u201d, but rather a nice little Segway into my now-husband joining the family.", "I've got to say I'm with you. Lots of people are saying it's really just asking for her dad's blessing rather than permission, which, sure, but why is it the man asking the woman's family, as if the woman can't decide for herself, or as if she belonged more to her family than the man does to his?\n\nBut since your fiancee wants this, could you maybe double it up so that you ask her parents, and she asks your parents? Or possibly, both of you ask both your parents? That would make it less misogynistic.", "If it is something your girlfriend wants talk to her dad. My husband went to talk to my dad. To ask his permission. My dad laughed at him and told him son you don\u2019t need my permission you need me wishing you luck.  And my dad just kept laughing at him. Scared the crap out of my husband", "Compromise. Tell him of your intent to propose. Don't ask.", "You\u2019re girlfriend wants you to. That should be enough. YTA", "YTA, it\u2019s not a big deal and if it\u2019s important to her and her family you can suck it up and do it.", "NTA but also you shouldnt propose without asking him as she has now said thats what she wants. \n\nI also would find this super weird and I wouldnt do it. If it was a deal breaker for an engagement then we wouldnt get engaged. Ultimately its up to you if this is a difference you can live with in which case get over it and ask him, or not in which case tell her you wont be proposing if thats a prerequisite. Bare in mind this might (likely) be relationship ending.", "Do you want to enter a family with such strict gender roles and adherence to tradition? I wouldn\u2019t, the idea of asking my dad for permission has always sat wrong with me but that\u2019s my choice. Would I want to be with a partner who does operate like that? What does that look like for my future?", "*It's an extremely outdated tradition for one.*\n\nYou could say the same thing about marriage/weddings.  \nI'm going to go with soft YTA, if it only mattered to her father it would be one thing, but it's important to the woman you supposedly love, and will literally cost you nothing in doing it.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t his property and you don\u2019t need permission any more than she needs to ask your parents if she can be your wife. Besides, what if he says no? You just gonna shrug and break it off? Your wants and needs matter too. This is just too old school. Do you also collect a dowry???", "NAH. I am with you -- I told my ex-husband that if he asked my father for a blessing/permission before proposing that I would NOT marry him. If I was with someone who absolutely had to ask before getting married, well, we wouldn't be getting married.\n\nBut I also see where she's coming from. Families are weird. I didn't want my dad to walk me down the aisle, but I got the distinct impression that if I didn't do that, I might end up disowned, and it just wasn't worth the trouble. Everyone has their own hills to die on.\n\nIf this is your hill to die on, so be it. But you should break up with your girlfriend because it seems like she's not going to budge.", "NAH.  I think there will be much larger compromises in a marriage than doing this for a wife.", "NAH\n\nI honestly don\u2019t blame you, especially considering what you said about her father. The question is how repulsive do you find it, and is this something you\u2019d be willing to do for your fianc\u00e9? He might be difficult, but her father is still important to her and this act (a \u2018blessing\u2019 rather than \u2018permission\u2019 as commenters suggested) might be worth it to help you two get accepted as a couple. We all know how difficult the stereotypical conservative dad can be.\n\nIm always one who lives by the philosophy \u2018pick your battles\u2019, and winning this battle could result in the headache of a \u2018my other daughter did it right and her husband respected me\u2019 mindset in FIL. He could end up favouring the kids who did it \u2018right\u2019, consider them more in inheritance, be the first to be thought of in family heirlooms and other tangible ways. You might not care about his money but your wife might care about feeling overlooked.\n\nIt is up to you to decide whether going through the motions of this sexist tradition is too loaded for you  (though bear in mind you\u2019re probably already expecting her to change her last name - part of her identity and how she\u2019s known to the world - to yours and have her last name erased from her children in spite of her doing all the work bringing them into the world. That\u2019s a far more sexist and impactful thing than asking a blessing from her dad).\n\nIt\u2019s up to you to figure out if this will be a one off or potentially the first of many things you will have to do to appease this man. That\u2019s a real consideration and something worth talking to the future wife about in a non accusatory way. But if you think this is a one off, I would strongly consider doing it not because this man is owed anything, but because you love your fianc\u00e9 and you know doing this will make her life a lot easier and with the money, help her get her dream wedding", "NTA. It\u2019s completely valid you don\u2019t want to support an outdated, pretty misogynistic tradition. You should talk this out with your gf though instead of just proposing. It seems she only wants you to do it for the money, which seems pretty shallow tbh.", "NAH, but if asking permission seems weird (it felt weird for me), instead reframe it about a conversation about your intentions with his daughter and asking for his blessing (or whatever way this would make it not weird). I had this conversation with my very southern (accent, food choice, manners, not politics) wife\u2019s brother as her dad is out of the picture and reframing it as \u201cI wanted to let you know my intentions toward your sister\u2026.and ask for your blessing.\u201d Significantly less weird than asking permission, at least for me and it keeps with the tradition in a way that isn\u2019t as weird.", "YTA - you're right, it is an old fashioned thing to do but its a simple thing that maybe doesn't mean anything you but it means a lot to your future wife and father in law and will give you a lot of goodwill fromt he inlaws going forward.  At the end of the day, this is the father of your partner, why would you want to make anything more strained? suck it up!", "NTA. You are right that you shouldn't have to ask permission and your comments show that he is possessive over her which is (in my opinion) gross and not okay. It would be different if she'd asked you to ask for his blessing to join the family or something but permission? Nope", "NTA. I have strong feelings about this tradition so I don't think you're TA for not wanting to. I also know traditions can mean stuff to people but for her it doesn't seem sentimental or meaningful but about money. \n\nI would leave my partner if he asked my parents' permission, or anyone's permission to marry me. That's how strongly I feel about it. I'm not property. A relationship is about the people involved and no one else. It feels really crude and inappropriate to me. I want nothing to do with it myself. \n\nPeople need to know that people can have strong feelings about this issue one way or the other and no one is wrong for their feelings even if it means not giving into whatever your partner wants.", "INFO : is she persian or turkish ?", "YTA, why do you care so much? She asked you to do something that means a lot to her so why not just ask one very simple question. Its not something I care about but when I proposed, I asked my wife's father for permission to marry her. The thing is its not like you are asking for permission, you just tell him that you love her daughter and would like his blessing to marry her.  Makes me wonder if you are just to scared of him and are just using this excuse to get out of it by saying it offends you to ask for permission so you look better to others", "Don't ask for permission. Instead, ask for his blessing. A subtle but important difference, and should still make him happy.\n\nNTA", "My husband was 34 and I was 27, he didn't ask permission, but after we got engaged we went to my parents together asked for their blessing.", "YTA. Your gf wants to be traditional and it\u2019s probably something they always have done. Could be something out of respect or her culture. Whatever it is, she just asked you to do it because that\u2019s what she needed from you. Instead, you had to turn it into some sort of philosophical battle. You scared to talk to her daddy big man?", "YTA it doesn\u2019t matter if you think it\u2019s outdated, there\u2019s a lot of different ways to go about it without disrespecting your partners wishes. I wanted my SO to ask my dad, despite both of us knowing it wasn\u2019t needed it was important to me that he make the effort. And my dad looked at him and said \u2018I don\u2019t control her or make her decisions but I\u2019m happy to have you in the family\u2019 and my SO would never have gotten that welcome to the family if he hadn\u2019t gone out of his way to set up some alone time with my dad. It\u2019s IMPORTANT for people! And if she wants you to do it to get more wedding money then fine! Sounds like you just don\u2019t like her family and are setting yourself up for being the least liked SIL.", "YTA.\n\n\"It's outdated.\" So are plenty of things I'm sure you still enjoy.\n\n\"I can do what I want to do with someone I love. I don't need anyone else's permission.\"\n\nThis is actually disgusting and highly concerning. You can't do whatever you want with somebody just because you love them. You still need consent. Her consent, and her father's blessing because she asked you and said it's important to her, and it's not that big a deal unless you're so unable to swallow your pride that you'd lose the woman you claim to love over something so trivial and easy to get through.\n\nYou're selfishly making this all about you, when it's not at all.", "NTA\n\nBut have the conversation by telling him. Don't ask him for nothing.", "NAH, yeah it's stupid to ask him, the only person who should be saying yes or no is your girlfriend. But this isn't that big of a deal. Marriage is built on Compromise, and if you can't do that on a small thing, how are you going to be able to compromise on the big stuff.", "Definitely NTA - I asked both my wife's family and my own father for their blessing/permission before I got married. It is/was a hispanic tradition on both sides. My father said no so that definitely soured some feeling between us. Later on, he came around but I will never forget/forgive it.\n\nEven though I asked, in hindsight, I wouldnt have asked nowadays because (1.) it lets  her family know that they can try to control you and your relationship, (2.) removes the \"agency\" from your wife - what example would it set for your kids (especially the girls) and (3.) it sets a negative tone in the relationship with your future wife (she shouldnt put conditions on how you ask her). If she wanted, let her ask your family for permission and propose to you.\n\nWho really cares if they are going to give you some money for the wedding. They are just going to use as a mechanism to try to control you and your wife.", "NAH. I agree completely on principle. The idea is outdated and misogynistic. I wouldn\u2019t want it done for me. All that jazz. BUT. In this situation, you both know it\u2019s dumb and that you\u2019re not *really* asking for permission and you\u2019re just doing it for a little extra money in the budget, so I don\u2019t see the harm. I can understand not wanting to perpetuate that culture by continuing that tradition, but at least as far as I\u2019ve seen, asking the dad for permission isn\u2019t like a big public thing that everyone\u2019s gonna know about. In the last 2 years I\u2019ve been to 3 weddings and seen probably 30 of my former classmates get engaged/married and I have NO IDEA if any of them asked permission. Ultimately, I think it\u2019s pretty harmless as far as concessions to the patriarchy go, and probably worth it to keep your bride happy and not go into so much debt for the wedding.", "How many cows will you get in the dowry?", "Yta bc she's asking you to do it, but honestly I would consider this a red flag too, what else is she going to run by daddy dearest in the future that's none of his business, and do you want to be there to find out?", "YTA\n\nI get where you're coming from and i agree, right up until she asked you to do it.  Do it for her", "YTA. This is something that's important to her. You either respect her enough to do this, or you don't. And if you don't, you shouldn't be marrying her", "YTA - you\u2019re not asking for permission, you\u2019re asking for his blessing. I\u2019d say if this is a deal breaker, maybe don\u2019t get married though. If you can\u2019t concede this to your gf, marriage is gonna be a real treat for you.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely outdated tradition. If I\u2019m ever talking marriage with someone they will be told NOT to ask my dad as it would very much bother me. My dad also knows damn well not to expect it.\n\nBut it clearly matters to your girlfriend and that\u2019s what\u2019s really important here.", "YTA. Is the tradition outdated? Yes. Is it sexist? Undoubtedly. Is it important to your partner and doesn\u2019t harm anyone? YES.", "\n\nThis may be an outdated formality, but more than asking for permission you are asking for his blessing. Your girlfriend is likely also dreaming with the moment he walks her down the aisle and probably even cries when she thinks about that moment. \n\nI see where you are coming from, but this is your girlfriend\u2019s wish and you should do everything possible to make this day special for her, so YTA if you don\u2019t even compromise.", "YTA. She asked you and you didn\u2019t want to. If this the culture I\u2019m thinking about, the point is see if her father thinks you\u2019ll be a good spouse past the rose tinted glasses.

The person you love asked you to. That should be enough", "YTA.  This is a longstanding tradition and it's just being polite.  You're not technically \"asking permission.\"  Obviously you're both adults and you can get married whenever you want.

It sounds like she's close with them and just wants them to be included.

I\u2019d really like your blessing in becoming a member of this family.\u201d That angle made for a really, really sweet moment in which my dad got to tell my BIL that he\u2019s beyond proud to call him his son. He even included all of us siblings! It was an incredibly small moment that meant the entire world to all of us, and now we have a new brother/son/family member. \n\nI think that this could have been that kind of moment for OP, and he let it slip past him because making a stand against the tradition was more important- which is really sad.

So I just think he kinda sucks for failing to see that.", ">However, not everything about relationships is logical.\n\nThis, right here.  That tradition never made sense to me in modern times, but sometimes we shrug, acknowledge the weirdness that's been requested, and do the weird or illogical thing.  It's practice for the rest of your lives, hopefully. \n\n20 years ago, my husband proposed while we were both serving overseas. He was 28 and I was 25 and we hadn't met each other's families yet.  I excitedly called home to share the news.  Crickets.  My mother says,  \"and he didn't think he needed to ask your father?\"  Well, I popped off.  \"Are you kidding me??!  I'm a 25 year old woman living in a different country than you,  making my own money and my own decisions!  Why would he ask an independent woman's father for permission?!  How _insulting_!\"  Thankfully,  the subject never came up again.  We ended up eloping a few months later and we'll celebrate 21 years this year.  We have a very nice relationship with my parents, too... but when it comes to US, our decisions are not based on parental input or approval.  OP may shrug and do it for her,  but he also might want clarification that this parental \"approval for money\" ends with this concession.

I am an independent woman. But if down the line my BF proposes, I would want him to ask both of my parents (divorced) for their blessing, though that can be different from permission. I want an affirmation that my family would support us because I do hope whomever I marry has a good relationship with them.

It's a whole different mindset she's approaching this marriage with that he doesn't agree with.\n\nIn my mind, it is none of anyone's goddamm business that my partner and I have decided to get married. It's a step that *we* are taking together as a team, and if he felt the need to seek validation from others, let alone permission, before going through with it, that would be extremely alarming to me.\n\nObviously that's not the way that everyone looks at marriage, and that's fine. MANY people look at a marriage as a family affair, and that's valid, too. My mindset isn't any more \"correct\" than anyone else's. But when two people are getting married, they need to be of *the same mindset* and on the same page about what marriage means. There is no deciding vote, because there isn't a vote at all, just a mutual understanding of the decision that you're making as a couple, the meaning that it holds, and the expectations that go along with it. If you're not on the same page about those meanings and expectations, that's a fucking problem.", "Maybe an alternative is that you can tell her father what your plan is without actually asking his permission\n\nThis is indeed a very good compromise.\nAnyway NTA", "She\u2019s asking him to do it for the money, though.

I kind of think the mother of the bride is left out of the equation a) because daughters tend to confide in their mothers more privately throughout the relationship and the mother has already provided feedback and b) it allows for a frank, man to man conversation.\n\nI think the reason why brides aren\u2019t expected to seek permission from the groom\u2019s parents is because the bride will be the one to sacrifice her body to bear children after the marriage.\n\nI know that it\u2019s a leap of faith for brides and grooms and modern life and marriage comes in many forms.

Should you and your boyfriend no longer commit to spending your lives together because your parents don't like it? To me, saying or implying that you won't get married without their blessing is kind of insulting to your relationship. It means that what your parents want is more important than how you two feel about each other. I would never say this to myself, my GF (if I had one to propose to), or her parents.
