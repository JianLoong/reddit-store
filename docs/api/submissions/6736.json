You are a renter without private green space wanting the benefits of a homeowner with a private yard.", "So by that logic is it ok for them to take any of her patio furniture?  Or a flower pot?   Even a community garden plot provided by the city or township has rules about not taking what you did not plant.", "They said \"raised beds.\" They've laid something down on the grass or concrete (my last roommate used railroad ties), and filled it in with soil. \n\nThis is not someone's dedicated back yard. This is a shared space that they've tried to claim for private use.", "r/suddenlyintothewoods", "It really depends on the culture of your building. Personally when I had a chair outside for smoking, id see others do the same and never cared, never happened to have someone be there when I wanted to sit that might have been awkward but if it's outside, not on *your* property, it's communal imo.", "If the chairs and toys are in the communal space - then by all means please take them. It\u2019s fine for communal space to be used by everyone. \n\nSince you have raised beds - do you not have a patio to place them that is not communal.", "I love the idea. Totally use their kids toys and sit at their tables etc. just to be petty.", "Excellent idea! Maybe she could pay the rent by giving the neighbors some food from the garden. After all, neither of them actually own the land and that way they can both enjoy the profits of having a garden.\n\nOf course they aren't entitled to ALL the food from her garden, or even MOST, but a little bit, sure! That would be nice!\n\nIt would be too bad though if they started to just take wantonly from OP's garden without their permission, almost like they're disturbing the symbiotic arrangement. And if they were to go as far as to yell at their neighbor for not giving them all the food they want from said garden that would definitely be an asshole thing to do.", "So you base all of your judgments on the limited word title and not the actual details given? Why even answer at all? Seems like a waste of time.", "Duh, all of Reddit is timewasting, so what.", "I mean, if you don\u2019t mind sounding ignorant, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.", "Basically NTA, I get the opposition because it's a community space, but we're talking about assholes here, not legal details.\n\nIt's one thing them taking a lemon or something because you've said it's OK, but actually digging up stuff is a step too far.", "NTA. In my opinion your neighbors have a lot of nerve.", "Yes you are", "NTA and as it is a community garden, send your neighbours a garden tax bill for your purchases,  time and effort. \n\nAs a community they have contributed zero dollars for this additional advantage", "NTA. Rescind all permissions to use your garden.\n\nAlso, plant some ghost peppers.", "NTA", "Tricky but  YTA. As you said, it's in a shared area. That means that even though you call it yours, it kind of isn't. \nIf you put stuff in a common area, common people are going to use it. Either start growing inside or move somewhere you have your own growing space (that's actually yours).", "Doesn\u2019t matter. A kitchen garden around the door of one\u2019s place should be sacrosanct.\n\nBesides, neighbor gave permission by accepting OP\u2019s offer. They messed up by overdoing it like the entitled do.", "What? If someone left a bike out there, you'd be entitled to use it??", "And be sure to move it around. It's community furniture", "It does matter and Op has confirmed she put her garden in without consulting anyone. It's basic consideration to ask before you put semi permanent items in a communal space. She's taking space away from others - not right.\n\nThese neighbours are also not doing the right thing by taking too much fruit and herbs. But if OP doesn't respect the rules of common consideration and manners how can she be surprised when the neighbours don't either?\n\nEsh.", "Not the same thing. And I am not saying they are entitled to the garden. I am saying you can't expect people not to just ignore it and not take away from it. If you don't put a lock on your bike someone would steal it. They wouldn't be entitled, but they would take advantage. See what I'm saying?", "NTA. We share a backyard with our neighbors. Some have highbeds. I keep it in flowerpots. We offer to neighbors, but they always say, they only take it if we have too much. Nobody ever took vegetables without asking first, even though they could. Your neighbors are entitled. It would make me uncomfortable to raid my neighbors highbed even though I'm allowed to take herbs and vegetables. Maybe have something like a cage around it (like for rabbits or hamsters) Looks ugly, but you could put a lock if this keeps on happening.", "Take this as a learning experience. Your neighbors are selfish. So next year don't plant anything in the communal area and just keep them in your apartment. \n\nIf they ask just tell them the truth. Their inconsiderate pilfering of the garden and leaving nothing behind for you the person who worked on said garden was not acceptable to you. So you took away the garden you worked on and placed it inside your apartment. \n\nIf they want you to plant a garden in the communal area so they can get some produce. Well they will need to sign a little contract. \ud83d\udc31", "My only thought, as a farmer, is that there's an excellent chance you've been blaming your neighbors for squirrels digging up your garlic.", "INFO The comment about Baltimore suggests a racial component to this.   Is that the case?", "Info: Does your lease say anything about the common space? In my condo, anything planted or placed in a common area became common property.", "I love that.\ud83d\ude00", "Put a bunch dog poop where you usually put the garlic. So when they dig their hand into it, it gets poop.\nIf they get mad, you just say you\u2019re fertilizing the soil\nAnd if they had ask you could have told them there was poop there\n\n\nSpray cayenne water all over the herbs. These will be a sacrificial grow you won\u2019t eat. Or pee on them", "But they're his raised planters outside his house. Just because it's a communal area doesn't mean that it's communal property", "No, she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s 4 feet from her back door. And she offered to SHARE with her neighbors. The neighbors took it all. She asked the neighbors nicely to leave some for herself (the person actually doing the gardening work). The neighbors continued to take ALL of the produce and do ZERO of the work. They have repeatedly taken advantage of OP and have the nerve to verbally assault her and call her selfish.\n\nThis imagined boundary that everyone is so sure that OP is violating by just gardening by her own back door because all of the backyards are connected by a shared courtyard is ridiculous. Does OP have the right to go onto the neighbors\u2019 patios and use their lawn furniture or grills? This is a human decency issue, not the freaking fence cutting wars of the Wild West.\n\nOP is willing to share the produce. The neighbors are assholes and are taking advantage of her generosity.", "Raised beds are a type of planter, what point are you trying to make?", "No. It makes literally no sense with the judgement. Just because you can expect people to be assholes, doesn't mean OP has done anything wrong. Even in your example, forgetting a lock for a bike doesn't make someone an asshole.", "As long as you have permission from the owner, it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal that you have a garden in your immediate vicinity of your home. I\u2019m sure your neighbors have some things outdoors that you don\u2019t touch. In fact, you should use their things and say that they are in the common area, so what\u2019s the problem?", "When you say \"planter\" I picture something like [this](https://www.flowerwindowboxes.com/modern-planter-boxes-p/pl-nampl-30x12x12.htm). It's larger than a flower pot, and intended to be more permanent, but ultimately it's movable. If the landlord says it's not allowed *here*, so can you move it over *there*, that's doable. \n\nA raised bed is laid right on the existing surface. It can be a finished wood structure costing thousands, or you can build it from any sort of [scrap wood](https://www.chatfieldcourt.com/do-it-yourself-raised-garden-beds-with-scrap-wood/) or [concrete blocks](https://sunshineandrainydays.com/build-cinder-block-raised-garden-bed/). You can lay down a bottom of plastic or plywood to keep it separate from the soil, but you don't have to.\n\nMy point is that planting a raised bed is more like digging up the landlord's lawn to plant a garden than it is setting a few pots on your patio.", "Not saying they are right to do it, just that this is the expected behavior. Forgetting a lock is not the same as not locking it up intentionally. How much fine print do you need? I have argued my last remark. If you do not understand I can do nothing more for you. Be blessed!"]}
