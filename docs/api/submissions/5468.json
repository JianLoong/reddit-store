Enjoy a relaxing morning wake up, have a cup of coffee, blah blah blah before getting on the road.  It's okay if you miss their breakfast if it's more enjoyable for you to take your time.", "NTA but at some point you should probably tell them that sleeping on the couch is fine for teens but not for a 40+ adult. Don\u2019t make a big deal of it, just be clear.", "NTA\nIf a couch is all I have to offer, I won't be offended if people decline. The only problem may be that it never seemed a problem before, so they have no idea what's wrong all of a sudden.", "NTA\nDon't feel guilty;  why the hell wouldn't you want to be treated like everyone else?\nI can relate to your post because I have often found myself in the same situation you describe.\nMaybe someone will get a clue someday, but until then, I hope you know your attitude is admirable under the circumstances.

Just because it\u2019s Christmas with family doesn\u2019t mean you have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. You\u2019re still seeing them for the day, just not staying over. Shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal.", "NTA - I think you handled this well. There\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. If you don\u2019t want to do it, you\u2019re not obligated to.", "NAH. You were offered an accommodation, as was their preview, and you didn\u2019t want that one, as is yours. Good for you on having boundaries! I often go home in similar situations because I like sleeping in my own bed : ).", "NAH. You have every right to sleep on bedding that is comfortable for you. You get the sloppy seconds, I think, simply because there's a lack of space. So they are not doing this to slight you. You, on the other hand, do not need to feel guilty about declining the invitation.", "NAH, there are alternatives, choosing go and come home same day, getting an air mattress, renting a hotel room nearby.  Bottom line is there should be no reason to be hurt about this.  The suggested arrangement doesn't work for you and your not really fussing about it.  Your doing what you need to do for you and that is ok.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This should be the response whenever they have these \u201cfamily\u201d get togethers at your Dad\u2019s home.  When you get the invitation and you\u2019re told you will be sleeping on the couch or anything other than a real bed, don\u2019t complain.  Instead, politely decline\u2014without specifying why and if you still want to attend, drive up late, stay a few hours and leave.  Eventually, perhaps, someone with a brain cell working will have the light come on and realize why you\u2019re doing it.

They'll keep offering you the couch, so you need to let them know. You've nothing to feel guilty about... I wouldn't stay over either.", "NTA.  You have a right to a decent night's sleep, too.  I would probably do the same thing.", "NAH - you are entitled to your feelings, and you're entitled to want to get a decent night's sleep. And you are going to visit. \n\nBUT \n\n>someone not even in our nuclear family is prioritized over me\n\nMIL actually IS in your SIL nuclear family, and I presume is at least verging on elderly. I would have prioritized her to have a bed/bedroom as well.", "YTA for not seeing that she's family and she's undoubtedly not in as good health as you. Beds don't go by \"who was in the family first\"; they go by NEED.", "NTA. I would do the same thing if I were you. If you\u2019re inviting someone to stay at your house you should offer better accommodations than just a couch. At the very least they should get an air mattress for you. I do think you should tell them why you\u2019re not staying over. You don\u2019t have to make a big fuss about it either. Just tell them that given the chose between your bed at home and your parents\u2019 couch, you would rather sleep in your bed. If they try to guilt you about spending quality time with your family, just point out that you\u2019re the only one who is expected to go without proper accommodations in order to spend quality time with your family.", "26 year old male here and those accommodations would not be sufficient for me either.", "Sofas, air mattresses, floors, I'm too old for that shit. I don't even do sleepovers anymore. My own bed or a hotel all the way...", "NTA.  I would not make up the I have to work excuse and just laugh and say, \u201coh I am way beyond the age of sleeping on a couch anymore - I will pass but thank you for the offer\u201d. You don\u2019t sound petulant or pouty and hard to argue with that.", "You. I like you.", "Yup. I (40s) made the mistake of sleeping on the sofa this past fall while integrating new cat into the household so my older cat did not feel neglected... I did not make it through the night and could barely move the next morning. Never again!", "They all have beds so it doesn't seem like a problem to them? Something that has gone on forever is not \"all of a sudden\".", "That's a great response, and helps me feel much better about things. Thank you.", "If OP\u2019s parents don\u2019t have the space, they shouldn\u2019t have invited OP and they shouldn\u2019t be guilting OP about not coming. This is a slight because OP\u2019s parents didn\u2019t prioritize the comfort of one of their invited houseguests.", "OP has a very good reason to be hurt. It sounds like their family is always treats them differently just because they\u2019re unmarried and childless. A person needs to comfortable whether they have kids or not.", "She's fine. There is nothing wrong with her, and she is only ten years' older than me. There is a decade between my and my brother, so that's why there is only about ten year's difference between me and the SIL mom. \n\nBut I understand your point, hence my guilt. Was also raised a certain way, and it was ingrained in me that women also get preferential treatment. \n\nI'd rent a hotel room, but then they would definitely know why I am starting to balk at staying overnight during holidays and that could cause some serious long-term issues. I suppose I'll be selfish this time, and suck it up and carry on like I have been afterwards. I'm burnt-out this holiday season and feeling frayed, though, so I know I'd probably be an ass after waking up on that rock-hard couch with people walking around you and no privacy.", "LOL\n\nYou know they'll cajole you to stay longer when you try to leave, so it makes sense to have a relaxing morning.  And if they call or message you to ask where you're at, just say, \"I'm getting ready to leave.  Go ahead and start without me.\"\n\nDon't forget that you're a grown adult and while you should try to be a good guest, you don't have to cater to unreasonable demands to fulfill their expectations.", "You should tell them though.\n\n\"Hi, I no longer sleep on couches, air mattresses, or any other bullshit besides a bed, in a room by myself, with a door that shuts.  So if you want me to stay overnight, you now know what I require.  Otherwise, it's day visits only.  I'm sure you understand.\"", "I think you misunderstood me.\nIt's no problem for the others because everyone else gets to sleep in a bed (except for OP).\n\nOP never mentioned that the lack of a bed is a problem. He said he is very agreeable, so they probably didn't even notice that it bothers him. After a couple of years now he had enough of everyone being treated better than him, simply because he is single. For him, the whole thing developed over years, for the others, suddenly he is not coming anymore, even though nothing changed. There is actually no reason for them to suspect that he is bothered by anything. They will probably believe his excuse that he has to work the next day.\n\nTldr: It has gone on forever, but for the others, the change of heart appears to be sudden and out of nowhere (if they can spot that he is not staying because of a change of heart at all)", "Suggestion? Tell them the truth, you're just not physically comfortable on the couch. I had to make a decision a few years ago about sleeping on my parent's couch when I go to visit them (small apartment, no spare room). I'm 46, and I'm getting those aches and pains that come with encroaching age. I now rent a B&B when I go see them. They were a little hurt the first year, but I now do it every year, and the visit is SO much better now that I am comfortable at night.", "Tbf they SHOULD know that's why; it's not a situation that's going to change and if you're put in a scenario where you have to decide between being uncomfortable or leaving earlier than you might like to due to limited accomodations year after year it'll breed resentment", "Honestly, you are never really justified for complaining about free accommodations. A lot of people stay with relatives during the holidays who don't have any spare beds. Just depends on how much you want to be with family ig", "Thanks! This is a good suggestion. I will try that. Communication of feelings is not in our family's wheelhouse, but it's worth a shot.", "You're right. \n\nTalking about or discussing things isn't a strong suit of our family. We're more of a 'sweep it under the rug and don't talk about it' clan.\n\nNot a justification, more an explanation as to my reluctance to talk about it. Not to mention it would undoubtedly get back to the MIL, who is a good person, and would feel guilty and is the type to stop visiting because of it. \n\nI hate feelings. Hence my crowd-sourcing them out to all of you.", "It's also an amazing improvement on the visit I have with them that I have my own PRIVATE space to go back to at night. Try it LOL, I wish I'd started this way earlier ;-)"]}
