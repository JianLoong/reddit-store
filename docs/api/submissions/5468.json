Those may not be the exact numbers, but it's reminding me a little bit of musical chairs. Someone is not going to get to sleep where they want to. But I do agree that if they know how OP feels, they might help out with a hotel or something. OP seems to suspect that they think so little of them that they offer them substandard sleeping accommodations and then basically communicate, oh well, get over it. This could be the case. We don't really know for sure.", "Personally, I find keeping control in these sorts of situations more empowering than choosing to play the hurt game.  I get it, but a choice has been made to do what's best in OP's opinion.  We can agree to disagree and that is fine.", "Maybe they'll surprise you and offer to trade off hotels or something once you bring it up or if you ask explicitly, but yeah I recognize that's a fraught situation.

I understand they cannot ask MIL to sleep on a couch ( she is probably in her 60s or 70s I suppose, which means that night on the couch=A lot of back pain) but I also understand that is uncomfortable for you to be the one that has to always sleep on the couch/air mattress.\n\nI have a suggestion, though I don't think it's plausible: couldn't your SIL and MIL share a bedroom while you and your brother share the other bedroom? Also, where does your dad sleep? Is there a third bedroom? Couldn't you sleep with him?", "NAH\n\nIt is fine that you don\u2019t want to sleep on a sofa or air mattress.

Would you like your sil\u2019s mother to not come along? Who would you ask to take the sofa or air mattress? It doesn\u2019t feel like you would do much different yourself.\n\nThese arrangements are just so common that I don\u2019t think most of us see it as a problem from either side. I\u2019ve put guests on sofas, air mattresses, twin sized beds. I\u2019ve been a guest with less than great sleeping situations. It is not ideal but they are free accommodations. There always were other better options in the area if we wanted to pay.", "NTA Why have a bad night because they prioritise other people?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm 38 and single and this shit gets old real fast.

My family is the same -- and if you insist on a hotel they get all offended!

Couldn't get comfy, and naturally I fell off the couch, wrecked my back, and... yeah, no. Hotel time. Y'all can get offended if you want. I'mma get some sleep.\n\nThe singles discrimination is a rotten cherry on a crap sundae, but end of day it comes down to what's more important: your comfort, or your family's concern for appearances (because that's the main reason they're insisting that you stay; they like looking like their family is close-knit and cozy -- except they're not listening to you, so appearances are not reality in this case). It might be worthwhile to try and talk to your parents about this, but if you already know you'll be talking to a wall, then remember that your reasons for not wanting to stay overnight are not their business.
