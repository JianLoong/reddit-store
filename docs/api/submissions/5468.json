Those may not be the exact numbers, but it's reminding me a little bit of musical chairs. Someone is not going to get to sleep where they want to. But I do agree that if they know how OP feels, they might help out with a hotel or something. OP seems to suspect that they think so little of them that they offer them substandard sleeping accommodations and then basically communicate, oh well, get over it. This could be the case. We don't really know for sure.", "Personally, I find keeping control in these sorts of situations more empowering than choosing to play the hurt game.  I get it, but a choice has been made to do what's best in OP's opinion.  We can agree to disagree and that is fine.", "Maybe they'll surprise you and offer to trade off hotels or something once you bring it up or if you ask explicitly, but yeah I recognize that's a fraught situation.

I understand they cannot ask MIL to sleep on a couch ( she is probably in her 60s or 70s I suppose, which means that night on the couch=A lot of back pain) but I also understand that is uncomfortable for you to be the one that has to always sleep on the couch/air mattress.\n\nI have a suggestion, though I don't think it's plausible: couldn't your SIL and MIL share a bedroom while you and your brother share the other bedroom? Also, where does your dad sleep? Is there a third bedroom? Couldn't you sleep with him?", "NAH\n\nIt is fine that you don\u2019t want to sleep on a sofa or air mattress.

Would you like your sil\u2019s mother to not come along? Who would you ask to take the sofa or air mattress? It doesn\u2019t feel like you would do much different yourself.\n\nThese arrangements are just so common that I don\u2019t think most of us see it as a problem from either side. I\u2019ve put guests on sofas, air mattresses, twin sized beds. I\u2019ve been a guest with less than great sleeping situations. It is not ideal but they are free accommodations. There always were other better options in the area if we wanted to pay.", "NTA Why have a bad night because they prioritise other people?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm 38 and single and this shit gets old real fast.

My family is the same -- and if you insist on a hotel they get all offended!

Couldn't get comfy, and naturally I fell off the couch, wrecked my back, and... yeah, no. Hotel time. Y'all can get offended if you want. I'mma get some sleep.\n\nThe singles discrimination is a rotten cherry on a crap sundae, but end of day it comes down to what's more important: your comfort, or your family's concern for appearances (because that's the main reason they're insisting that you stay; they like looking like their family is close-knit and cozy -- except they're not listening to you, so appearances are not reality in this case). It might be worthwhile to try and talk to your parents about this, but if you already know you'll be talking to a wall, then remember that your reasons for not wanting to stay overnight are not their business.

I think it also makes a difference where people are living. I will absolutely sleep on the sofa at a friend's home if they're in a one bedroom. I'm not so crazy about getting a couch or air mattress if I'm the only single in a house full of couples and everyone else has a bed. I lived in a one bedroom apartment until recently, and I had a comfortable pull-out sofa, which worked fairly well for guests, but I'm so glad to have a guest room now so that whoever is staying is able to close the door and have some privacy.", "NTA. You're being treated less than the other siblings by being forced to sleep on the couch every time. Why should you spend time around people who don't prioritize you?", "NTA.  As soon as I moved out holidays became a visit and go, not spend the night.  I have a bed I would prefer to sleep in.", "NAH.  It\u2019s fine to prioritize your comfort and decline the couch, though your comment about nuclear family getting priority betrays your immaturity. The MIL is a precious guest and should be prioritized as such.  Your father is being a gracious host to offer the bedroom to the grandmother who is helping care for his grandchild.  Stop sulking.", "Nta if there isn't enough room, there isn't enough room.   Also, this sounds like the couch was sprung on you last minute so you couldn't get a hotel room.", "op=NTA\n\nThis thing that deprioritizes single/child free adults is insulting.\n\nI think this is a reasonable compromise in seeing your family but not forced to substandard arrangements(if they still object, they can pay for a hotel room for you).", "NAH\n\nObviously a 40 something year old wouldn't want to sleep on the sofa. That's just begging for pain the next day. But it also can't be helped that the others are taking the beds.

Or perhaps get an air mattress, which would at least be more comfortable than the sofa?", "NTA.  MIL is older than 40.  I get that she gets a bed.  If SIL's MIL lives with them or is just close, I understand them bringing her as not many want to leave their parent alone on the holidays.  It should have been suggested to that side of the family to get a hotel or that they all share one guest room and OP gets the other.

No. That is ok when you are a kid. I'm 42 and my knees make audible noises, all the time! I turn my head too quickly and I'm sore for days. I'm too fucking old to sleep on a couch.

Plenty of people do it with two people, and some do it with one.", "Yeah but deciding not to visit someone because of uncomfortable sleeping arrangements has nothing to do with age? I won't do it either and I'm 23 so does that make me TAH?", "I think you might be in the sense you aren't prioritizing family over minor comfort, assuming you are a healthy young person and most capable of sacrificing some comfort. However I'm only 21, and while I'll sleep on a couch just fine, I understand the old and stiff and pain part as I'm disabled. I guess it's just about whether you'd sacrifice the relationship for whatever discomfort you may have for the night, which is usually far more minor as a young person. It wouldn't be unreasonable for people to distance themselves from you for being unwilling to sacrifice for them. Like why should they give effort when you won't? It's a hard line and sort of nah but not the best for interpersonal stuff. Sorry for the ramble it's not even about you please don't be offended I just got into the idea of how it would work lol", "Na I just don't visit or if I visit I'll get a hotel or something.

I just don't go unless I can find comfortable sleeping arrangements that work for me. \n\nI would rather pay for a hotel and have a goodnight rest then sleep on a air mattress or a couch. I meant I don't understand why people act like age is the only reason someone wouldn't like sleeping on a couch.", "Yeah you're right there's way more than age because everyone has different mental and physical needs at any age. You sound like you've got your routine down!!", "NTA. I will never understand relatives that invite you over but are woefully unprepared for having extra people in the house.

But when they ask I would admit honestly why I don\u2018t stay. They can\u2018t change it when they aren\u2019t aware how you feel. It is often normalised that couples get the beds and singles the uncomfortable alternative and people tend to not even think about it and besides that - the MIL is older - social norm is to give the older one the more comfy option. But again - I understand your feelings and there should be a better solution", "This has happened to me most of my life due to being single. Married siblings and nieces got the beds i got mattresses on the floor. I stopped staying 10 years ago.", "NTA, they can't not offer you a bedroom AND get upset you aren't staying the night!", "NAH. I assume MIL is much older and a couch would not be appropriate for her putting a couple and their baby in a room makes sense too but doesn't mean you have to sleep on a couch if you can drive home to your bed!

I will have back pains for a week if I sleep on a couch. you're not a child.", "I'm only 36 and I wouldn't do that if I lived close enough to drive.

No! NTA! There is nothing wrong with you spending the day then going home.", "Omg one night on a couch. Get over yourself.", "NTA. If they cannot really provide accommodations for you then you can't be expected to suffer through that. You're an adult, stay where you can get some rest.", "NTA.

By the MIL coming, your brother is able to spend the holidays with both his families and not having to alternate xmas.  Couch sucks but being with family is the priority.

It's so intense that even my SIL and my nephew call it my couch now.", "NTA. You're being an adult.", "NAH.

I need space to be away from other people when I feel the need to be alone. I also wouldn\u2019t go to a family gathering if I\u2019m expected to stay overnight and not have my own room.
