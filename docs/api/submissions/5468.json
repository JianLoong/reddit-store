You, on the other hand, do not need to feel guilty about declining the invitation.", "NAH, there are alternatives, choosing go and come home same day, getting an air mattress, renting a hotel room nearby.  Bottom line is there should be no reason to be hurt about this.  The suggested arrangement doesn't work for you and your not really fussing about it.

This should be the response whenever they have these \u201cfamily\u201d get togethers at your Dad\u2019s home.  When you get the invitation and you\u2019re told you will be sleeping on the couch or anything other than a real bed, don\u2019t complain.  Instead, politely decline\u2014without specifying why and if you still want to attend, drive up late, stay a few hours and leave.

I would have prioritized her to have a bed/bedroom as well.", "YTA for not seeing that she's family and she's undoubtedly not in as good health as you. Beds don't go by \"who was in the family first\"; they go by NEED.", "NTA. I would do the same thing if I were you. If you\u2019re inviting someone to stay at your house you should offer better accommodations than just a couch. At the very least they should get an air mattress for you. I do think you should tell them why you\u2019re not staying over. You don\u2019t have to make a big fuss about it either. Just tell them that given the chose between your bed at home and your parents\u2019 couch, you would rather sleep in your bed.

I would not make up the I have to work excuse and just laugh and say, \u201coh I am way beyond the age of sleeping on a couch anymore - I will pass but thank you for the offer\u201d.

I (40s) made the mistake of sleeping on the sofa this past fall while integrating new cat into the household so my older cat did not feel neglected...

Thank you.", "If OP\u2019s parents don\u2019t have the space, they shouldn\u2019t have invited OP and they shouldn\u2019t be guilting OP about not coming.

It sounds like their family is always treats them differently just because they\u2019re unmarried and childless. A person needs to comfortable whether they have kids or not.", "She's fine. There is nothing wrong with her, and she is only ten years' older than me. There is a decade between my and my brother, so that's why there is only about ten year's difference between me and the SIL mom. \n\nBut I understand your point, hence my guilt. Was also raised a certain way, and it was ingrained in me that women also get preferential treatment. \n\nI'd rent a hotel room, but then they would definitely know why I am starting to balk at staying overnight during holidays and that could cause some serious long-term issues. I suppose I'll be selfish this time, and suck it up and carry on like I have been afterwards. I'm burnt-out this holiday season and feeling frayed, though, so I know I'd probably be an ass after waking up on that rock-hard couch with people walking around you and no privacy.", "LOL\n\nYou know they'll cajole you to stay longer when you try to leave, so it makes sense to have a relaxing morning.  And if they call or message you to ask where you're at, just say, \"I'm getting ready to leave.  Go ahead and start without me.\"\n\nDon't forget that you're a grown adult and while you should try to be a good guest, you don't have to cater to unreasonable demands to fulfill their expectations.", "You should tell them though.\n\n\"Hi, I no longer sleep on couches, air mattresses, or any other bullshit besides a bed, in a room by myself, with a door that shuts.  So if you want me to stay overnight, you now know what I require.  Otherwise, it's day visits only.  I'm sure you understand.\"", "I think you misunderstood me.\nIt's no problem for the others because everyone else gets to sleep in a bed (except for OP).\n\nOP never mentioned that the lack of a bed is a problem. He said he is very agreeable, so they probably didn't even notice that it bothers him. After a couple of years now he had enough of everyone being treated better than him, simply because he is single. For him, the whole thing developed over years, for the others, suddenly he is not coming anymore, even though nothing changed. There is actually no reason for them to suspect that he is bothered by anything. They will probably believe his excuse that he has to work the next day.\n\nTldr: It has gone on forever, but for the others, the change of heart appears to be sudden and out of nowhere (if they can spot that he is not staying because of a change of heart at all)", "Suggestion? Tell them the truth, you're just not physically comfortable on the couch. I had to make a decision a few years ago about sleeping on my parent's couch when I go to visit them (small apartment, no spare room). I'm 46, and I'm getting those aches and pains that come with encroaching age. I now rent a B&B when I go see them. They were a little hurt the first year, but I now do it every year, and the visit is SO much better now that I am comfortable at night.", "Tbf they SHOULD know that's why; it's not a situation that's going to change and if you're put in a scenario where you have to decide between being uncomfortable or leaving earlier than you might like to due to limited accomodations year after year it'll breed resentment", "Honestly, you are never really justified for complaining about free accommodations. A lot of people stay with relatives during the holidays who don't have any spare beds. Just depends on how much you want to be with family ig", "Thanks! This is a good suggestion. I will try that. Communication of feelings is not in our family's wheelhouse, but it's worth a shot.", "You're right. \n\nTalking about or discussing things isn't a strong suit of our family. We're more of a 'sweep it under the rug and don't talk about it' clan.\n\nNot a justification, more an explanation as to my reluctance to talk about it. Not to mention it would undoubtedly get back to the MIL, who is a good person, and would feel guilty and is the type to stop visiting because of it. \n\nI hate feelings. Hence my crowd-sourcing them out to all of you.", "It's also an amazing improvement on the visit I have with them that I have my own PRIVATE space to go back to at night. Try it LOL, I wish I'd started this way earlier ;-)", "NTA but by your logic if 40s is too old for the couch wouldn't MIL be older?", "NTA", " Unless bad weather makes it a difficult drive home\\~I'd do the same. You're going for Christmas, you'll stay a few hours, and you'll drive back home. TBH, when I was single I was happier going back to my place (NOT spend the night)\\~and be able to chill at my home!", "NTA. Sleeping on the couch is a drag, plus that sounds like a lot of people in one place. Surprised they even want you to stay what with a new baby.", "Your NTA for not wanting to stay and sleep on the couch when driving down for the day is an option for you and would be a far more comfortable thing for you, but I really would try not to take it personally.\n\nYou may be in your 40's but you are likely comparatively young compared with the MIL, and your bro and SIL are a couple with a new baby, they need a room, so it wouldn't really be practical for them to take the sofa. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's not personal, it's what is practical, but you are entitled to feel drained by it and not want to stay over if it can be avoided. (Also your family maybe shouldn't over commit to housing people overnight if they are routinely having people sleep on the couch)", "If you don\u2019t tell them why you\u2019re declining then it\u2019ll keep happening. They\u2019re not mind readers and you\u2019re a grown adult use your words. NTA though.", "NTA, but be honest with them, or nothing will change.  Maybe they will get a comfy sofa bed for future.  I would ask, though, are you really sensitive about being single rather than it being terrible to sleep on the couch.  I'm in my 40s and I would happily sleep on a couch to avoid travelling home. It's not like 2 people or an old lady could sleep on the couch.", "NTA. I would have made the same arrangements as your family though. Simply because guests (MIL) take priority to a host (she\u2019s there to help the new parents as she has been, and I would guess isn\u2019t super comfortable trying to navigate the new grandparent role in someone else\u2019s house especially over Christmas with everyone\u2019s traditions, etc. just a guess though) and because a couple won\u2019t fit on a couch. Also, they\u2019re new parents so the baby is probably in the room with them. New parents & baby are always going to have a separate space if possible. It\u2019s really best for everyone \ud83d\ude05\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t stay on the couch if I were you though I don\u2019t feel this was an intentional slight. I hope if they had a 3rd extra room you\u2019d be able to stay in it.\n\nNow, if in the future when MIL isn\u2019t present if they start giving that second room to the kid, THAT I would have a problem with.", "NTA.", "NTA I think a lot of these NAH aren\u2019t the single family member that is always thought of last. It\u2019s crap and I wouldn\u2019t go and sleep on the sofa either.", "NTA", "MIL isn\u2019t in OPs fathers family is what OP is saying", "But how do you prioritize when you've got, say, beds for six people but you've invited eight? Those may not be the exact numbers, but it's reminding me a little bit of musical chairs. Someone is not going to get to sleep where they want to. But I do agree that if they know how OP feels, they might help out with a hotel or something. OP seems to suspect that they think so little of them that they offer them substandard sleeping accommodations and then basically communicate, oh well, get over it. This could be the case. We don't really know for sure.", "Personally, I find keeping control in these sorts of situations more empowering than choosing to play the hurt game.  I get it, but a choice has been made to do what's best in OP's opinion.  We can agree to disagree and that is fine.", "Maybe they'll surprise you and offer to trade off hotels or something once you bring it up or if you ask explicitly, but yeah I recognize that's a fraught situation. I hope y'all are able to find something that actually works for everyone tho!"]}
