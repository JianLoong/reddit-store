Also, a loan of 250 dollars can even help your score. That's why most secured credit cards are 100-300 dollars. that's the starting amount.

I would not trust her with money going forward if she can\u2019t exercise self control. Also I would be clear to her that you\u2019ll deduct the extra money from future payments to her so she\u2019s not rewarded for being reckless financially.
