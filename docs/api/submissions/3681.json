Most of those furniture deals only report your credit when you screw it up, not when you pay it. A small, secured bank credit card that gets one bill put on it and immediately paid off would have made a lot more sense.\n\n If you have the money pay off the bed before the grace period ends and take it as a lesson learned", "This whole story seems sus. Typically, you don\u2019t start building a credit score until 18 because you can\u2019t finance a car loan or get a credit card until then. I see that you also don\u2019t answer a lot of questions others are asking. You also should know by your stated age and credit score that this small purchase will not help her score at all. The whole system is garbage. Please tell me the last time your credit score went up because you paid a bill or an item off early.", "Ok, but has she done this before??", "She spent 650 on gifts for me and other people, and she now does not have enough to pay the bed off before the deadline, she had been paid and then spent her money and part of the bed money, so I will now have to give her more money.", "Depends entirely on where he financed it.\n\nAll my local furniture stores report it as a new line of credit, and therefore would be useful, albeit briefly, to raise credit.\n\nSecured cards are good when you have terrible/no credit (student cards are better for young adults with no credit, IMO.) Not when you just want to reinforce your score", "So you are paying for your own christmas present?\n\nHave fun", ">\tshe had been paid and then spent her money and part of the bed money, so I will now have to give her more money.\n\nDo you, though?\n\nIt might be time for her to experience the consequences of her decisions\u2014as in SHE didn\u2019t pay her half of the $3500 bed in time, so SHE will be on the hook for any and all costs over and above the half you agreed to pay.\n\nMaybe she needs to see that she didn\u2019t spend **$650** for Christmas presents: she just spent about **$4200** for Christmas presents.\n\nMy major concern with this is possibly jeopardizing the good credit you have established."]}
