Today was the third time this week I found a glob of residue in my plate, and I lost it. I grabbed the plate and brought my wife over to the sink and demonstrated to her how to properly scrub the entire plate, and she just zoned off and stared into space.\n\nI told her to stop being disrespectful and watch my demonstration because she clearly doesn\u2019t understand how to wash the dishes properly (or maybe now that I think about it, she is just pretending to be incompetent at it.) She started crying when I said this and told me to leave her alone and she ran to the bathroom. Now I feel bad for making her cry, but I am sick of her not doing a proper job. AITA?\n\nEDIT:\n\nOkay, so most people are making GIANT assumptions about the distribution of labor in our relationship. I do the dishes and all other chores HALF THE TIME. And I do a proper job, without being reminded beforehand.\n\nMeanwhile, my wife has to be constantly reminded and begged to do her turn of chores, whether that be dishes or mopping. And she whines and complains when I remind her to do it, and will do a half assed job and rush through so she can get back to whatever else she is doing.\n\n I take my household responsibilities seriously because I respect the value of living in a clean home, while my wife acts incompetent at doing chores to get out of doing them or because she doesn\u2019t feel like it.\n\nAlso, I told her the first two times this week when she left dirty plates\u2014 I asked if she could be more thorough while cleaning the dishes because it\u2019s gross to find residue on them. She just rolled her eyes and said \u201cyeah, yeah\u201d and blew me off.\n\nEDIT 2: Now people are telling me to just let her do different chores, but y\u2019all don\u2019t understand this is her attitude towards all household responsibilities.\n\nHer laziness for chores isn\u2019t just when it comes to dishes.\n\nShe does all the laundry under the same settings because \u201cit\u2019s too hard to remember\u201d which settings to use for each type of clothing when I literally made a list guide for her so she could remember each type.\n\nWhen it comes to vacuuming, she tries to finish as fast as she can so the rooms are left with giant patches and streaks of dust.\n\nIt\u2019s her overall attitude of neglect that is bothering me. Because she expects me to do a proper job when it\u2019s my turn so she knows she can get away with acting incompetent.\n\nAnd I know she\u2019s not incompetent at doing these chores because whenever we have guests that she cares about coming over, she\u2019ll somehow muster up the energy and knowledge to properly clean stuff and take cleaning seriously.\n\nEDIT 3: context about \u201cbringing her over\u201d\n\nI left the table with my plate, went to the sink, and in a normal volume but annoyed tone, asked my wife to come over. She said \u201cseriously?\u201d annoyedly but then agreed to come.\n\nI said she needs to scrub off all the residue, and demonstrated. She paid no attention, so I said can you stop being disrespectful in a NORMAL VOLUME.", "created_utc": 1676783899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1162drq/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_wash_the_dishes/", "score": 3917, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife does need to learn to the dishes properly, and I agree with everyone who suggests undiagnosed ADHD. However, you could've been a bit more tactful with your approach to this. Blowing up about the dishes and calling her names (yes, even just as adjectives in the post) is unnecessary. Her not doing the dishes properly is for sure totally frusterating, you're valid for feeling that. But she's also valid for feeling hurt by your lecture.

That said, *patronizing behavior and words will not help you.* Might I suggest a cleaning strike? Clean up ONLY after yourself, keep your clean dishes out of community space, and see how long she keeps doing this.

How we do things and say things is just as important as what we are wanting to say. Op didn\u2019t sit with his wife during a calm moment and ask to have a household meeting and be like \u201chey babe, I love you but I\u2019m very concerned about how you do the dishes, and I personally just can\u2019t live with dishes done that way.

It really all comes down to the golden rule, and do you think that op would want his wife to corner him on something while he\u2019s eating dinner and bully him about until he cries? Or would he want to be spoken to and stealth with respectfully? Likely the second.

For example my husband gets really quiet and tense when he\u2019s upset until he gets up and needs to clean to have a minute to chill. If a wife did the absolute same thing that op did to her husband than I would\u2019ve used the same term.

If anyone finds theirselves in a relationship where they are unable to be a good person then I feel the only moral option is to leave that relationship. It\u2019s not okay to be disrespectful to your spouse, and it\u2019s not okay to treat someone the way he treated her.

I know this is going to get downvoted to oblivion, but is it really any surprise that women are given the benefit of the doubt so much more on posts about division of household labour, considering that what most of us see in our everyday lives is that [the majority of men in straight relationships aren't pulling their weight?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cars.12391)\n\nIMO it's similar to how commenters react to age-gap relationships.

Why? Because anyone who's been/known people in that situation, or even just read a lot of similar posts, knows that relationships where a much older person sought out a partner who wasn't long out of high school and had very little life experience etc tend to be super unhealthy.

They're also exponentially more violent.\n\nIn these circumstances, the 'gender bias' on AITA is just experience. Of course some people get it wrong, it's a massive forum.

This is true fact and I got 99 problems but this ain't one.
