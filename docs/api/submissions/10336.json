{"id": 10336, "submission_id": "1162drq", "title": "AITA for telling my wife to wash the dishes properly?", "selftext": "My wife is so neglectful when it comes to chores and does a half-assed job. Today was the third time this week I found a glob of residue in my plate, and I lost it. I grabbed the plate and brought my wife over to the sink and demonstrated to her how to properly scrub the entire plate, and she just zoned off and stared into space.\n\nI told her to stop being disrespectful and watch my demonstration because she clearly doesn\u2019t understand how to wash the dishes properly (or maybe now that I think about it, she is just pretending to be incompetent at it.) She started crying when I said this and told me to leave her alone and she ran to the bathroom. Now I feel bad for making her cry, but I am sick of her not doing a proper job. AITA?\n\nEDIT:\n\nOkay, so most people are making GIANT assumptions about the distribution of labor in our relationship. I do the dishes and all other chores HALF THE TIME. And I do a proper job, without being reminded beforehand.\n\nMeanwhile, my wife has to be constantly reminded and begged to do her turn of chores, whether that be dishes or mopping. And she whines and complains when I remind her to do it, and will do a half assed job and rush through so she can get back to whatever else she is doing.\n\n I take my household responsibilities seriously because I respect the value of living in a clean home, while my wife acts incompetent at doing chores to get out of doing them or because she doesn\u2019t feel like it.\n\nAlso, I told her the first two times this week when she left dirty plates\u2014 I asked if she could be more thorough while cleaning the dishes because it\u2019s gross to find residue on them. She just rolled her eyes and said \u201cyeah, yeah\u201d and blew me off.\n\nEDIT 2: Now people are telling me to just let her do different chores, but y\u2019all don\u2019t understand this is her attitude towards all household responsibilities.\n\nHer laziness for chores isn\u2019t just when it comes to dishes.\n\nShe does all the laundry under the same settings because \u201cit\u2019s too hard to remember\u201d which settings to use for each type of clothing when I literally made a list guide for her so she could remember each type.\n\nWhen it comes to vacuuming, she tries to finish as fast as she can so the rooms are left with giant patches and streaks of dust.\n\nIt\u2019s her overall attitude of neglect that is bothering me. Because she expects me to do a proper job when it\u2019s my turn so she knows she can get away with acting incompetent.\n\nAnd I know she\u2019s not incompetent at doing these chores because whenever we have guests that she cares about coming over, she\u2019ll somehow muster up the energy and knowledge to properly clean stuff and take cleaning seriously.\n\nEDIT 3: context about \u201cbringing her over\u201d\n\nI left the table with my plate, went to the sink, and in a normal volume but annoyed tone, asked my wife to come over. She said \u201cseriously?\u201d annoyedly but then agreed to come.\n\nI said she needs to scrub off all the residue, and demonstrated. She paid no attention, so I said can you stop being disrespectful in a NORMAL VOLUME.", "created_utc": 1676783899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1162drq/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_wash_the_dishes/", "score": 468, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife does need to learn to the dishes properly, and I agree with everyone who suggests undiagnosed ADHD. However, you could've been a bit more tactful with your approach to this. Blowing up about the dishes and calling her names (yes, even just as adjectives in the post) is unnecessary. Her not doing the dishes properly is for sure totally frusterating, you're valid for feeling that. But she's also valid for feeling hurt by your lecture.

That said, *patronizing behavior and words will not help you.* Might I suggest a cleaning strike? Clean up ONLY after yourself, keep your clean dishes out of community space, and see how long she keeps doing this. If she\u2019s adamant to live in an unhygienic environment, time to reevaluate compatibility. Don\u2019t let her weaponized incompetence force you to work more than is fair.

Just reiterating the point that this type of behaviour is a very very common symptom of ADHD and that it may be worthwhile to look into it", "[removed]", "I think it\u2019s more he says that she\u2019s lazy and does it on purpose. But perhaps was doing it properly at one point. But not to his standard so he re washes everything. So she divided why bother when he\u2019s going to do it again. \n\nI get told I take too long doing the dishes because I\u2019m making sure there\u2019s no blobs of food.", "Updated my comment to include them both!", "I'd say I'm shocked but I'm really not.", "and if you do post, no need to keep things like gender real if they\u2019re not relevant to the situation", "Honestly I don\u2019t assume negative intent until I have a reason to. I\u2019ve seen ops side and how he talks about his wife. I do think it\u2019s a possibility that it came from weaponized incompetence, which would definitely be wrong and disrespectful, but I also see possibilities of depression, adhd or op being a perfectionist who\u2019s problem is streaks and exaggerates. I\u2019m not saying any of those options in specific are what it was, but I just feel like I don\u2019t know the other side of the story enough to just assume disrespectful from her with how he speaks about her.", "Again, kindergarten rules at minimum if you wanna communicate with me. Sit with yourself and think about why you feel the need to be misogynistic, accuse me of being okay with things that are obviously now, and then be more misogynistic. Sit with yourself and ask yourself if you really want to be a horrible toxic abusive kind of person that\u2019s going to start off with being hateful and awful to half the population. And if you do feel that that\u2019s the person you want to be go ahead and block me because I\u2019m not taking the bait. Do better. I believe that you are capable. Anyone can do better than what you just said.", "Same to you, no one needs your Reddit diagnosis. I understand the symptoms perfectly. I am also a woman, so get out of here with the misogyny card.\n\nAnd, if you have an issue. Go ask for help, work on yourself. Don't get upset when you are confronted with your failures.", "Yeah, no dude. It\u2019s not okay to talk to people the way you just did. That\u2019s all I have to say to you. Go back to kindergarten and learn to treat others how you\u2019d wanna be treated. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love a hostile comment first condemning your entire gender and then calling you stupid for an observation based on ops very combative behavior in his comments.", "Wow. Thanks. I think we all knew there was gender bias on this sub", "You said he was \u201cmansplaining\u201d in another comment. Bit hypocritical of you to talk about condemning an entire gender lmao", "That...is actually exactly what that means. I literally joke to my husband that we need to have guests over every two weeks because that's the only way I can get the house really clean.\n\nURGENCY is one of the things that actually allows/helps people with ADHD to focus. That's why we have a huge tendency of leaving \"boring\" tasks for the last possible second - like starting a huge essay the night before it's due even though you've had weeks to work on it.", "I\u2019ve explained this more thoroughly in another comment, but I really empathise with your wife here. I struggle with chores, but if people are coming over I have massive anxiety about them judging me for the state of the house and so I go into panic mode with cleaning and tidying. It is possible she could have ADHD or another issue which is affecting her in doing the chores but still be \u201cable to magically conjure the attention span\u201d when others are coming over. (I\u2019m not saying this is the case for your wife. I don\u2019t know her. Just pointing out that it\u2019s not as impossible as you think)", "Oh damn he\u2019s got a medical degree now.", "Yup\u2026 that\u2019s literally ADHD. I can\u2019t stand doing yard work, but I magically fund the urge when it comes time for a yard party.", "The entire way he\u2019s approaching the situation is very disrespectful. I\u2019ve just listed many options that are \u201ctake her to the sink\u201d, force her to watch a very purposefully demeaning demonstration, be rude to her for not wanting to be treated like a child and further treat her like a child, and be emotionally abusive and disrespectful. How we do things and say things is just as important as what we are wanting to say. Op didn\u2019t sit with his wife during a calm moment and ask to have a household meeting and be like \u201chey babe, I love you but I\u2019m very concerned about how you do the dishes, and I personally just can\u2019t live with dishes done that way. Could I should you how I do them? For me this is 10/10 important and is a need in a relationship, and I just wanna solve the issue so we can move forward with everything working for both of us. \n\n\nEffective respectful communication even when you are frustrated can be hard sometimes, but it\u2019s incredibly important for a successful, healthy, respectful relationship. It really all comes down to the golden rule, and do you think that op would want his wife to corner him on something while he\u2019s eating dinner and bully him about until he cries? Or would he want to be spoken to and stealth with respectfully? Likely the second. And reading between the lines it also sounds like ops wife may have depression, and if so if that\u2019s a dealbreaker for op than that\u2019s that, but he shouldn\u2019t treated her bad because of her disability.", "I would absolutely say that if a woman took her husband to the sink, taught them how to wash a dish like he\u2019s a child, tells him off for not paying what she feels like is enough attention, and then berating him for that until he cries. Or since a lot of guys don\u2019t cry wives should know their husbands enough to know their husbands equivalent to crying. For example my husband gets really quiet and tense when he\u2019s upset until he gets up and needs to clean to have a minute to chill. If a wife did the absolute same thing that op did to her husband than I would\u2019ve used the same term. I\u2019ve never used that term before, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything better to word the incredibly rude way that he treated his wife like a child and was emotionally abusive to the person that he\u2019s supposed to love, honor and RESPECT. If anyone finds theirselves in a relationship where they are unable to be a good person then I feel the only moral option is to leave that relationship. It\u2019s not okay to be disrespectful to your spouse, and it\u2019s not okay to treat someone the way he treated her. I support him in the wanting a solution to her not doing the dishes adequately, but I could never support treating someone like that.", "And btw, you\u2019re wrong about me. I will absolutely go to bat for anyone that I feel is treated unfairly, regardless of gender. I\u2019ve stood up for guys and girls and I have very strong morals about treating people well, especially after leaving a abusive marriage. I just don\u2019t feel that op is right in how he went about dealing with the situation nor with his being combative in comments. The second is literally against the rules of the sun.", "Ok we disagree fundamentally and that\u2019s ok. I simply don\u2019t see it the way you do.", "This is the exact point im making. You guys will go to any lengths to make op seem like an abusive husband. She can\u2019t wash dishes properly as an adult. This is already ridiculous enough. It\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened so obviously it\u2019s frustrating for op. \n\u201cWhat she feels like is enough attention\u201d so her zoning out and refusing to listen is okay? If she acts like a child she deserves to be treated like one. \nCouples argue all the time. Him raising his voice is not emotionally abusive. That\u2019s a serious accusation that unfortunately women throw around so easily on this subreddit. She is lazy and doesn\u2019t want to try do her part and is clearly immature as she can\u2019t accept any criticism. \nYou want him to mollycoddle her? How is that fair on him?", "No, that\u2019s the thing. No one deserves to be treated like a child in a relationship. Never ever. Everyone deserves a healthy respectful relationship if they are in one. If you find yourself unable to be respectful in a relationship the only moral thing to do is leave the relationship. There\u2019s no excuse for treating your spouse like a child. And that goes for men and women. Everyone deserves to be a respectful relationship if in one. And no one has an excuse to treats their spouse the way op did-man or woman.", "No, he doesn't have to wash all the dishes himself. He doesn't live in that house alone.\n\nShe is part of a partnership and pretending to be incompetent so your SO would do everything is extremely disrespectful and him just taking all the chores would just reward that type of behavior."]}
