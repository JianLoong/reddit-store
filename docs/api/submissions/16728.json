The last time I found him he\u2019d just done two shots and got himself a beer, he wanted to stay longer but we were both done and tbh I did snap at him a bit for disappearing constantly and doing shots on a quiet night when he was supposed to be in work this morning. \n\nAs we were leaving we were arguing a bit but my bf was clearly intoxicated and just wasn\u2019t even making any sense, I didn\u2019t want him to drive home but he was yelling and scaring me a bit so I did get in the van and his friend sat next to me (3 seats up front). We dropped his friend off and he yelled at me to move over as we drove away from his house, I was already scared and crying at this point and did not want to undo my seatbelt while he was driving and told him I will when he pulls over. When he did I undid my seatbelt and was about to get out of the van but he started driving before I\u2019d fully even moved over. I put the seatbelt on and begged him to stop because he was scaring me but he wouldn\u2019t. I told him I would call the police, and he said to do it and I did.

That kind of fear shuts down the mental circuits you need for logical decision-making. It's easy to say \"you should've/shouldn't have done XYZ\" from a distance, but it's a lot harder to think that clearly about it in the moment when you're being faced with an angry partner you're afraid of. \n\nAnd I speak from some experience here, bc my father was the same way. He would drink and then insist on driving, and gods help you if you expressed discomfort with him driving while drunk or asked him to slow down or anything. He would fly into a rage that was genuinely terrifying, scream at everyone, crank the erratic and aggressive driving up to 11. There were times as a kid I remember thinking we were going to die before we got home bc my mom had tried to ask him to let her drive and it just pissed him off worse. The kind of person who reacts with anger when someone tries to point out they shouldn't drive drunk can't be reasoned with, and I'd suggest we might extend OP some compassion about being faced with that and doing the best she could, under the circumstances.", "I\u2019ve definitely learnt my lesson.

Why won't he still let me freeload off him.\" Even though he shouldn't be driving drunk,  she made the choice to get in the car with a drunk driver. She chose to use this man for a free ride.

Good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "HE ruined his life, you didn't. He decided to drink and then drive erratically and didnt listen to you when you asked him to stop. He shouldnt have driven in the first place. You really do need to get out of his house ASAP though. That's a terrible situation to be in. Look in the paper for anyone needing a roommate, call up family and friends and see if theres a couch you can crash on or go to the city HUD if you're in the US and request emergency housing. The longer you stay, the possibility of him seeking revenge goes up, specially since hes blaming you for his own behavior.  Your safety is number 1 priority!!", "He fucked around and found out.\n\nI guess he could trespass you from the property, but the time for dealing with him as an adult seems to have passed.", "Why do you care what he tells them?

Not aggressive *until now*.\nThis is the start of his escalation. Get out quietly and never go back.", "Yes he does. She's freeloading.

What makes you think I\u2019m freeloading, I\u2019ve mentioned a few times I pay my way with rent and bills? \n\nI\u2019ve not even called him an asshole, I want to leave asap.

It's really funny.", "That changes things for sure. You technically have a right to stay there, although it sounds like you won't want to. This relationship is probably over, so it might be easier to leave sooner than later.", "He can prove you're a threat to him though. And if he evicts you. You'll pay his legal bills too. Why did you end a relationship if you were using him to take care of you", "Idk I think you both kinda have the situation skewed. I don\u2019t need him for housing or anything really if I\u2019m confident enough I\u2019ll be able to find housing and storage space within 2 days after paying him rent and half of the bills for the house a week ago. \n\nI only got in the car in the first place because he was yelling at me to, which he hasn\u2019t yelled at me like that before so I was scared. I didn\u2019t realise the situation after that would be so much scarier at the time but I guess I\u2019ve learnt that lesson the hard way.", "Is your name on the lease? Yes?

Why would you assume he'd keep housing you after that?", "NTA, OP, things can be replaced. Take only valuables and get the hell out of his home and away from him. If this was his first offense, he would have just gotten a ticket. Sounds like he has a history of driving under the influence. This is NOT your fault, but your boyfriend's drinking is out of control and he is already verbally and emotionally abusing you. Please get out before it gets worse.", "Your not wrong for calling the cops, tbh you should\u2019ve done that before he even got into the car nor should you have gotten in the car. But YTA for staying in his house, Bffr, from the sounds of things this man is not right in the head and your pushing your luck by staying. You can pack up within the day or by the end of the night, call the cops so you can leave peacefully with all your stuff and move on. I would hope you\u2019d at least have some money to get a motel room for a night.

Sadly there\u2019s a lot of sick/cruel ppl and Too many women getting klled by their partners, so please even if you need to beg an old friend for money or go stay in a shelter, LEAVE TODAY! Not one or two days later, I couldn\u2019t even sleep in that crib for another day knowing he don\u2019t want me there.", "Please get out of there ASAP before he hurts you.

It\u2019s not charity and there are laws regarding eviction.", "He doesn't get to just keep mays rent while kicking her out because she wouldn't cover up his crimes.

She has a legal right here.", "She pays rent. Legally he has to give her a lot more than an hour.", "He was abusing you, OP and still is. I think you should go to a domestic violence shelter.
