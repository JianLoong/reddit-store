I can't imagine how betrayed I would feel if someone gave away my beloved pet - I don't think you went overboard at all.\n\nI'm seconding the comments suggesting you check with the pound. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.", "NTA. That was a sick& twisted thing for your mother to do.", "NTA but your mother sure is one.  And now she sent her flying monkey (GC Sis) to make you come to heel.  I'd go no contact with her.", "NTA - your mom owes *you* the apology. She should never have done that without talking to you about it, she basically sent your cat off to die. I would be livid!!", "Nta, well there are some lovely *old folks homes* she can go to later.

SFOY Saint For Only Yelling?   I mean, wow.  And not just rehome your cat, but put her in a POUND?!?!  That is some next level cruelty shit.  You have my sincere sympathies.  I agree with others.  Check with the pound.  Even if she was adopted, they may be able to tell you some info, maybe they can check with the new family on her.  IDK.  Im grasping at straws here for you.  Do NOT apologize to her for anything.  I truly am sorry.", "OMG -NTA!!!\n \nI would go NC, with the exception of a card every bday and Christmas saying \u201cyou still suck.\u201d", "NTA.\n\nWhen your mom gets old, put her in shitty home and forget about her.", "No you are not!", "NTA! What did I just read?  Not okay!  If anyone did such a horrible thing to me, that would be The END of our relationship!  That she's your 'mother' does not get her any leniency, in fact, she should have a higher standard because she's supposed to 'love' you and look out for you! That she was capable of doing this to anyone - let alone to her own daughter - is just reprehensible!  OP, you DO NOT owe her any apology - she should be on her hands and knees begging YOU for forgiveness!  Whether you want to maintain a relationship with a person capable of screwing over her own child like this is up to you.... but no, you DO NOT owe her anything!!  I would ghost her AND anyone who condones that behavior!", "NTA.  She lied to you and made a decision about your cat without consulting you.  As you said, you could have asked someone else to keep her at the time. As for the golden child, you don't have to listen to mom's favorite child who probably had a hand in it as well.", "If my mother did this to me, she would never ever see me again!", "NTA, sorry but your mom is a fucking awful human being. Anyone who puts a loved pet (who isnt even theirs!) at the risk of being put down over something so petty is legitimately an awful person. Easily could have called you to take the cat back or at least talked to you about options, but instead dumped a poor animal for her own selfish reasons. She doesnt deserve forgiveness let alone a fuckin apology as if she was the one who was wronged.", "NTA, I would have fist caught her", "NTA Your \"mommy dearest' knew what she did was vile that is why she lied.
