Me and my wife haven\u2019t really been close with our daughter since she started college as she confided that the reason was that she had a lot to deal with. By a lot to deal with is \u201cher boyfriend\u2019s drug benders\u201d. \n\nAccording to my daughter when they first started dating she didn\u2019t know about his drug use until awhile in and she realised that he was severely addicted to a multitude of hardcore drugs. She would continuously try to \u201cfix him\u201d and he would go through these times when he is strictly sober until he falls back and my daughter would feel inclined to \u201cmake him happy\u201d at all costs so he can be sober for longer next time.\n\nNonetheless, he went to his family and our daughter came to us. The whole time she was near the edge though tried hard to keep up a happy facade, she would constantly check if he was alright and be severely panicky.\n\nA couple of days back, when me and my wife were preparing for a big dinner for all of our relatives. She came to us, looked like she has been crying and told us that she would have to leave earlier than expected. We all knew she was going to run to him as he probably stopped his sobriety especially since he was with family. \n\nMy wife (her mother) was understanding and tried to offer her as much solace as possible, though I felt quite irritated that he had somehow managed to ruin our family time. Not only did he ruin our planned dinner but he ruined her whole stay as she was always on the fringe of frenzy. \n\nI told my daughter once my wife left to bring her supplies that \u201cyou may as well never come back if this is the way you are\u201d. My daughter was clearly taken aback by this and just left upset. After my wife helped her pack, she came downstairs to me and got angry at me for saying such a thing and now our daughter doesn\u2019t ever want to come back. \n\nMy daughter drove back to god knows where clearly upset at me as she didn\u2019t say anything to me, though said goodbye to her mother.

What if his habit affects her ability to keep a roof over her head? Should she still never come home? What if he hits her or subjects her to severe psychological abuse? Should she still never come home? Also, did you even think about the fact that your little temper tantrum might lead to you never see her again.

It would have been hard to accept that she was leaving after you and your wife were preparing a big meal for the relatives. 9 times out of 10, a 19 years old is not equipped with the necessary tools to help someone on drugs. His family needs to do more to help him. It\u2019s not her burden or responsibility to carry. She\u2019s a young adult", "YTA: OP, your daughter is dealing with a really hard situation. She doesn't need you to turn her back she needs your support. You're her parent forever not just until you decide you don't want to be a parent anymore. She loves this man and clearly he's got a tight mental/psychological hold on her. You don't get to tell her she can't be there for him. Some lessons she will need to learn on her own and if this relationship crashes and burns, she's going to need people who love her to fall back on and help her put the pieces back together and that is you and her mom. \n\nApologize to her. These relationships are not black and white. She could very well feel like his life is her responsibility. You don't have to approve the relationship or even like this man but she is your daughter and will be til the end. Support her properly, she will likely need that at some point.", "YTA. I was in a relationship with a narcissist who didn't ever want me to leave his house and who would blow my phone up constantly. My dad couldn't stand the man, but never once told me not to come back. When I got out of that relationship, my dads was the first place I went bc he made me feel safe and wanted even though I made questionable and hurtful decisions that he didn't approve of during the relationship. That's what parents are for. \nI couldn't imagine my parents telling me to stay away, nor could I imagine telling my own kids to stay away. That's childish and selfish. I don't even see how you're questioning if you are or aren't the asshole. How can you actually think you did the right thing?", "Yes, YTA. I'm glad your wife doesn't take your dramatics seriously, and I hope your daughter won't either. Yes, absolutely she is in a bad situation, feeling like she needs to fix this guy, but threatening never to let her come back is totally not the way to deal with this. You can certainly tell her that you will not support her financially if she insists on rescuing this guy, but it's ridiculous to tell her she shouldn't bother coming back, and basically needs to decide whether she wants to be in a relationship with him or with you. The relationship your daughter is in will straighten itself out one way or the other. Refusing to let her come home won't make any difference either way, other than to generate resentment toward you.", "YTA.\n\nShe's 19.  You're 49.  Yeah, perhaps she impinged a bit on your \"family time\" over the holidays but she's a grown adult, and so are you.  The fact is, she's still emotionally immature and this is probably her first serious relationship.\n\nNot to excuse her putting her relationship over your core family, but this is probably her first serious relationship and its a fucked up one at that.  But she's 19 so she can't yet see the forest for the trees.  This boyfriend is likely a lost cause and eventually, she'll see that very clearly.  She probably doesn't realize what an insidious beast that addiction can be, and probably (foolishly) thinks that acting like Cinderella will somehow \"heal\" her boyfriend.  It won't.\n\nAnd until you verbally wrote her off, you and your wife were probably the first people she would have apologized to once she walked away from him for good.  Now, it's not so clear what she'll do.\n\nBut she's 19.  Parents and kids who are 19 frequently say stupid and even hurtful things to one another.  I'd suggest giving it a week or two, and reach out to your daughter, and apologize.  Tell her you're \"here\" anytime she needs to reach out.  Even if she doesn't respond, she'll probably get the message and things will likely heal somewhat over time.", "YTA\n\nAre you trying to have her stay away?", "YTA by a mile. \n\nDude, you want to lose your relationship with your daughter and possibly your wife because of shortened family time!?  Your daughter is a caring and loving person and whether or not her relationship is good or bad is secondary to how you should treat her.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t about you. Your role is to provide a safe home for her, no matter what.

Did you not raise your daughter to be a kind, compassionate, all in on love kind of person?? Do you think that people with these issues dont deserve love and support, that spending energy on them is a waste of time?? \n\nLook, i realise its not the kind of situation anyone wishes on anyone, least of all their own child. i also realise there is a very real possibility that this relationship is abusive (if thats the case tho dear lord would that make you a monster). \n\nOfc its disappointing that your time together was cut short. Ofc you dont want her dealing with that kind of stress. But what are you saying, what message are you sending, when you tell your daughter that her rushing off to take care of someone who needs it immediately means she just shouldnt bother coming home again??

How could you!\n\nIs your family time so damn important that you basically tell your daughter, don't let the door hit you on the way out.\n\nI've dealt with people like you before.

I get tough love, but this was just too much.", "YTA. What's the plan, here? Obviously the situation isn't good.

At least one real adult is in her corner.", "Definitely YTA: Such a big man but you couldn't say that to your daughter while your wife was in the same room? Your daughter should always have your support. If she ends up in a bad place, she won't feel like she has the ability to go back home to safety because you shut those doors. What a prick, you are.", "YTA. I can not imagine a reason for a father to say that to his daughter in this situation. She is enmeshed in a bad situation with a drug addict, & you told her to go to him & stay there? What is wrong with you? Are you jealous? Does a ruined dinner mean that much to you? If anything, you should be reminding her that she doesn\u2019t have to do this, that she always has a home where she is loved & valued, that whatever she does right now, she can always come back to her family.", "YTA. Why bother having a kid if you\u2019re just gonna put her down, especially for trying to help someone she loves and cares for?

Based off how she left, it seems that she\u2019s also upset by the fact that she has to leave her family. While this might not be a healthy relationship for her, at this moment there is nothing you can do to change that. She deeply cares about someone and you should be offering sympathy and support for the distress she\u2019s experiencing.
