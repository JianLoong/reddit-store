The one in which her senior class presented their research took place on Monday, but this time around it is the underclassmen who are presenting their research. On Monday, the seniors were instructed to dress in business casual, but today there was no explicit dress code for those just attending the event.  \n  \nGiven this is still a professional academic event, I expected the norm to still be business casual. My SO went with a dress that looked very much [like this](https://i.imgur.com/QtlVGD5.png) but a much brighter yellow, and sleeves that only went to mid-forearm.\n\nI told her that maybe she shouldn't wear this dress and go with something business casual instead, to which she insisted that this was business casual. I replied saying it was casual but not business, and we went back and forth like that a little bit. Ultimately it's her call what she wears and I don't typically try to change that, but this was a professional event, and I subjectively didn't think that dress looked appropriate the occasion.\n\nI never was a big fan of this dress to begin with, and called it a grandma dress before, but the reason I had issue with it today wasn't out of personal distaste but for her professional image as these are the people she will be networking with for the rest of her career. At one point I said \"I just don't want you to embarrass yourself\" and her response seemed to indicate that she didn't believe that was my real reason, so I thought she suspected I was just saying this because I personally didn't like the dress.\n\nAfter that back and forth, I thought about that last point and wanted to clarify that this wasn't about my personal taste. What I said came out something like this: \"I want you to express yourself and it makes me happy when I see you being happy in how you dress, but I only say this because this is a professional event and I want people to take you seriously\". For some context, many of her classmates  in her small cohort and even some faculty had often been dismissive of her inputs, so that was an insecurity she had shared with me before, so I really upset her when I said \"I just want people to take you seriously\" because she essentially heard \"people don't take you seriously\" as if I was trying to change her dress in an attempt to *fix* her image as if it was something needing fixing. I could have been more clear by saying \"people might find that dress a little silly\" or something else that made it clear I was only talking about the dress and not her personally, if that makes sense.\n\nFor more context, she is in healthcare, so she's worn scrubs to school almost every day, and she hasn't had many chances to express herself. In the end, she decided to go back and change into her scrubs, which I feel really guilty about.  \n  \nI don't think she was TA at all, but is this a NAH situation, or AITA?", "created_utc": 1681998917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12szhlr/aita_for_pressuring_my_so_to_change_her_dress/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
