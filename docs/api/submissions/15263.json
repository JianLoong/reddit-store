{"id": 15263, "submission_id": "12szhlr", "title": "AITA for pressuring my SO to change her dress before a professional event?", "selftext": "This morning my SO was dressing up for a research symposium she's attending today. The one in which her senior class presented their research took place on Monday, but this time around it is the underclassmen who are presenting their research. On Monday, the seniors were instructed to dress in business casual, but today there was no explicit dress code for those just attending the event.  \n  \nGiven this is still a professional academic event, I expected the norm to still be business casual. My SO went with a dress that looked very much [like this](https://i.imgur.com/QtlVGD5.png) but a much brighter yellow, and sleeves that only went to mid-forearm.\n\nI told her that maybe she shouldn't wear this dress and go with something business casual instead, to which she insisted that this was business casual. I replied saying it was casual but not business, and we went back and forth like that a little bit. Ultimately it's her call what she wears and I don't typically try to change that, but this was a professional event, and I subjectively didn't think that dress looked appropriate the occasion.\n\nI never was a big fan of this dress to begin with, and called it a grandma dress before, but the reason I had issue with it today wasn't out of personal distaste but for her professional image as these are the people she will be networking with for the rest of her career. At one point I said \"I just don't want you to embarrass yourself\" and her response seemed to indicate that she didn't believe that was my real reason, so I thought she suspected I was just saying this because I personally didn't like the dress.\n\nAfter that back and forth, I thought about that last point and wanted to clarify that this wasn't about my personal taste. What I said came out something like this: \"I want you to express yourself and it makes me happy when I see you being happy in how you dress, but I only say this because this is a professional event and I want people to take you seriously\". For some context, many of her classmates  in her small cohort and even some faculty had often been dismissive of her inputs, so that was an insecurity she had shared with me before, so I really upset her when I said \"I just want people to take you seriously\" because she essentially heard \"people don't take you seriously\" as if I was trying to change her dress in an attempt to *fix* her image as if it was something needing fixing. I could have been more clear by saying \"people might find that dress a little silly\" or something else that made it clear I was only talking about the dress and not her personally, if that makes sense.\n\nFor more context, she is in healthcare, so she's worn scrubs to school almost every day, and she hasn't had many chances to express herself. In the end, she decided to go back and change into her scrubs, which I feel really guilty about.  \n  \nI don't think she was TA at all, but is this a NAH situation, or AITA?  \n  \nEDIT: pretty late to add this, but someone mentioned that it changed their mind about the situation and that I should mention this: my opinion wasn't unsolicited, she did initially ask what I thought about the dress.  \n  \nAnd for all the people arguing how accurate the picture is, you're just going to have to take my word for it. It's *very* accurate in every way but the color/pattern. Same neckline, same unfitted flowiness, same poofy sleeves. In terms of the cut the biggest difference is just that the wrists in the picture have a cuff whereas hers was more of a spandex ring kind of thing. If I was concerned about making myself look good I wouldn't have included all the details in the post that hurt \"my case\". Also, this was going to be worn as is, with flats. No tights, no belt, no jacket. \n\nAt this point we've long resolved the situation and moved on from it, but my inbox is still blowing up and I'm seeing a lot of these same misconceptions brought up so I just thought to clarify", "created_utc": 1681998917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12szhlr/aita_for_pressuring_my_so_to_change_her_dress/", "score": 1040, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother and grandmother wore them.", "Clearly you\u2019re too old to know what passes as \u201cbusiness casual\u201d for school events.", "If someone had a conference of NICU, peds, and labor and delivery nurses, they would all be dressed like this. Girlie was fine as an attendee, the bf is just an asshole.", "\"I told her that maybe she shouldn't wear this dress and go with something business casual instead, to which she insisted that this was business casual. I replied saying it was casual but not business, and we went back and forth like that a little bit.\"\n\nGiven that their entire debate seemed to pivot on this difference of opinion, it doesn't seem irrelevant at all.\n\nIf OP's gf had said \"I agree the dress is not business casual, but that's not the standard for attendees\" then I would fully agree with your position. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nDo you believe the dress to be business casual?", "How do you know the rest of the dress isn't like that though? The sleeves and brighter colors wouldn't change it that much.", "Except the event wasn't business casual. The OP just decided to insist it was.", "Maybe this is a regional or industry thing. I've worked in multiple business casual offices over the last 25 years or so, and none of them excluded prints from the dress code. People wore prints, they wore bright colors. That includes the headquarters campus of two Fortune 500 companies.", "That\u2019s an incredibly outdated definition, especially in regards to women\u2019s fashion. Most will be colorful, and typically have patterns anymore and stockings really aren\u2019t required at all. Just because it\u2019s professional doesn\u2019t mean it has to be boring. For business casual, I\u2019d say the dress is honestly borderline. Depends on the setting and the rest of the outfit/accessories. For students, I would give it a pass, especially as she was in the audience and not presenting. \n\nAlso I feel he\u2019s TA more because of the way he went about telling her the issue. He played on a well-known insecurity of hers. He should have worded it differently to say \u201cthat dress doesn\u2019t seem business casual to me, are you sure it fits the dress code?\u201d Instead he went for her self esteem. He also doesn\u2019t seem to be attending this event, so he wouldn\u2019t actually know how strict or lax they are about \u201cbusiness casual\u201d.", "And you're showing poor reading comprehension.\n\n>  \n>  \n>but **today** there was no explicit dress code for those just attending the event.\n\nLast sentence, first paragraph.    Everything BEFORE that was biz casual.\n\nAnd he basically browbeat/shamed/embarrassed her into changing.\n\nHow is that NOT controlling behavior?", "Yeah... My partner gives me opinions on my clothing especially when he knows I'm going to an important meeting. Is he controlling? No, he just has more experience in corporate environments than I do. It sucks that this is the way the world is, where often what you wear has an impact on how seriously others take you. But you have to play with the cards you're given.\n\nRe the outfit, being nitpicky here but I think with good accessorising -- especially a killer belt -- you could get away with it. Ofc based on OP's post it doesn't look like SO would be the type to do that. Either way it wouldn't be my first choice for a presentation I had to nail.", "Business Casual is certainly a dress code that has evolved over time. I think you'll find it leans much more casual these days. The dress is fine. At my corporate office that would be dressing up.", "Did you read the post? That event has NO DRESS CODE. The business casual was for a different event, with a more professional audience,", "Yeah tbh this could have been totally fine with a blazer, heels, and a nice hairdo. It probably still could have been seen as a little weird given the type of dress, but I see people rocking a casual dress combined with a blazer all the time.", "Meh, IMO it depends on the event. Job interview? Obviously very important. Undergrad symposium? Less so.", "> I work in tech, so my idea of business casual is a clean Iron Maiden t-shirt.\n\nBased", "Could you imagine someone presenting in front of 10,000 doctors wearing this nightgown looking thing?\n\nI mean no one would make fun of them to their face, but they would definitely be judged.", "She wasn't even presenting,  she was just supposed to attend , you'd surprised that people actually don't care about these stuff as long as presentation works well , as long as it's appropriate ( not much cleavage or cocktail kinda dress that would grab attention ) no one would bat an eye on you .", "I'm a health researcher in an academic setting and attend these events regularly. Academia isn't the same as corporate settings, particularly for STEM fields, and this dress is completely fine. Academics in my field do not care what you wear outside of placements, and even then the bar is pretty low so long as you wear appropriate footwear.", "He said mid forearm sleeves tho not mid bicep lol", "I mean, OP pointed it out but didn\u2019t stop there. OP kept insisting he knew what was better for the event than she did, and should have dropped it WAY earier than he did. He badgered her about the dress and tried to force her to come around to his opinion, instead of just doing what normal people should do: \u201cokay, it\u2019s your call\u201d after the first rebuff of his suggestion.", "Ok but the OP states that is was not a business casual event", "Yeah, I know people are trying to make business casual more casual these days, but this is not it. Like it or not, people do judge women in their attire. \n\nNTA", "It looks like a house dress/nightgown my grandma had. I\u2019m sorry but someone showing up to a business event in what is essentially a house dress is gonna start people talking and it\u2019s not gonna be nice talk.\n\nGenerally I\u2019d say let her wear whatever she wants but for this specific situation I\u2019m seeing it as special circumstances. If she wears that to a business casual event it\u2019s not gonna look good for her.", "You got all these downvotes, but no one countered your argument."]}
