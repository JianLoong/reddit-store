Everything went great the first year. She moves home for the summer and I just hang out over here. Cut to August, she brings a 2 month old untrained puppy home without asking. Poops and pees all over the house, chews the baseboards, is an overall horrible dog. She paid a physician under the table to sign it as an ESA. We get into a huge fight over it and whatever make up. She goes home with the dog for winter break. When she comes back the first thing she tells me is do not cut the dogs nails because the vet said not to bc she\u2019s \u201cfearful\u201d of the nail clippers. She doesn\u2019t take the dog out for walks and does nothing to keep the dog\u2019s nails in decent shape. I would be bleeding and bruised constantly from the dog scratching me. So, I decided to cut the dog\u2019s nails and the dog did completely fine. She leaves work early to come scream at me over it and blames me for the dog not being potty trained and having anxiety over nail clippings when this is HER dog even though I feed it and take it out on walks so it\u2019s not cooped up in its kennel all day. That was it for me, so I went to the leasing office and reported the dog. Next thing I know, she texts me that same night to \u201cfeed HER dog\u201d so she can go out and I said no and told her I was not resigning the lease with her. So I talked to the leasing office once again and I was able to be removed from the lease and move out. Now she has no furniture, her rent is double what it was. She has never paid a bill because I was in charge of all that. She tries to call our providers pretending to be me and cancel the bills and put them under her name. Now, changed the locks on her bedroom door when I have possessions in her room. She\u2019s not here for the next few days and I need to get out of this place by this weekend. Guess I need to talk to leasing again because now she has violated the lease 3 times.

You should\u2019ve seen the nails on this dog, no vet would tell anyone not to cut a dog\u2019s nails. She\u2019s just full of herself and thinks she\u2019s taking exceptional care of it.", "Right! And she still continues to blame me for every speck of damage in this household as if she has no blame for it. She\u2019s a complete narcissist and doesn\u2019t care about anything besides the dog and herself. Her parents just instigate the behavior too, telling her to lock all her pots and pans in her room so I can\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d them like I was even going to\ud83d\ude44", "Already did thankfully! Other friends that have been trying to convince me to move in with them for a while now. They have a dog as well, but at least I\u2019m going in knowing there\u2019s one and their dog is actually trained!", "She didn\u2019t \u201cwant\u201d me to, I just did it because I felt bad for the dog more than anything. She didn\u2019t want me involved with the dog at all yet brought it into my space and that\u2019s why it\u2019s all my fault that everything\u2019s wrong with it because it wasn\u2019t to her \u201ctraining standards\u201d (which is completely nonexistent)", "Our lease specifically states you can\u2019t change any locks, so they\u2019ll probably evict her after this since this would be her third lease violation. I\u2019m just not sure about the legality of being able to enter her room since there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019ll give permission.", "Knew her since high school, we were friends for 5 years before I had transferred to the same college as her and I was in need of a roommate. She needed a roommate so we decided to move in together and it was mutual respect for the first year and then straight downfall the last 6 months.", "It doesnt look like she actually cares about the dog tho", "Can you get your stuff then? Will the leasing office help you?", "Ouch. Sorry to see it end this way :(", "Seriously depending on what state you live in, If you alert nearby animal shelters, pet stores and animal control they will put her on a no adoption/buy list. It's essentially a registry for animal abusers and neglecters. If she tries to go to a reputable breeder to buy a dog it should pop up so they don't sell to her. The only thing is the pieces of crap who puppy mill and over breed don't care. Good luck.", "Why do you have stuff in her room? Reasonable question I think.", "Not sure, going to talk to them later today to see if I can.", "Yeah some people create their own chaos in life and then act surprised!", "They might possibly recommend she don\u2019t use clippers to trim the nails if she told them the dog is skittish, but file them down instead and she decided to take that as never trim them at all. She seems like the type to only hear what she wants to hear.", "It depends. For sure they have to be clipped when they are too long. \n\nWe walk ours twice a day and do really long walks multiple times a week, he does agility and my wife goes jogging with him. Theres no need to clip his nails as they wear down naturally.", "That was issue. She didn\u2019t have any natural abilities to wear them down because my roommate never walked her. Allowed her to use the bathroom in the house. When I would take her for a walk, I couldn\u2019t do it for long due to be being full time student and worker. It\u2019s only be for 15 minutes tops.", "I had a few things in the tv stand that she probably assumed were hers (I have receipts showing they\u2019re mine) and she took them and locked them in her room. She did the same process for the rest of the living room and kitchen, taking things that were mine.", "Now you know she was never a good person. She was just using you. NTA.", "Wasn\u2019t sure at first because a lot of people on here try to just leave without breaking/removing themselves from the lease. You did your due diligence and your roommate is horrible. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you moved in with my old roommate. Long story short, I had her evicted.", "NTA. For clipping dogs nails. Peanut butter is a great distraction. Not your problem anymore. Her doctor's note is useless if the dog is not trained. As in house broke not jumping on people. You did nothing wrong getting away from her. feel sorry for the dog. Make a call about neglect to the SPCA. Small claims court for theft if you can't get in her room.", "op=NTA\n\nThat you ended up having to care for her \"pet\" is ridiculous.  That you had to live in a \"health hazard\" environment is ridiculous. That she wasn't paying bills is ridiculous.\n\nOnly thing I don't understand--why don't you want her to transfer bills to her name?  Don't you want them OUT of your name as you are not going to be living there?\n\nAnd yes, you need to get office involved to get your stuff. But you also need documentation of your items(what you take and receipts/proof of what is yours) so that it doesn't come back to bite you--claims that you stole from her.", "I\u2019m leaving this weekend. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want them transferred, but she had called our providers pretending to be me to get them cancelled two days ago. She was trying to get the power and internet cut while I was still here. Leasing office said there wasn\u2019t anything they\u2019d be able to do about my stuff, even with receipts so guess it\u2019s just a loss.", "My vet said to bring her in and they would do it because of her anxiety with the clippers. That way she wouldn't become anxious of me. They didn't tell me not to ever get her nails clipped. Just let them be the bad guys.", "Yeah then they have to be trimmed. Your roommate is cruel, negligent and shouldnt be allowed to have a pet, besides all the stuff she did to you.", "Get a police standby to recover the last of your possessions. It's easier to prove you didn't steal anything with a police officer mediating the removal.", "They don't help at all, \"this is a civil matter, take it to the courts\".  I would just drill out the lock and call it a day."]}
