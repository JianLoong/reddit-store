{"id": 7805, "submission_id": "10gnosa", "title": "AITA for moving out and doubling my roommates rent", "selftext": "So, roommate and I got this apartment a year a half ago. Everything went great the first year. She moves home for the summer and I just hang out over here. Cut to August, she brings a 2 month old untrained puppy home without asking. Poops and pees all over the house, chews the baseboards, is an overall horrible dog. She paid a physician under the table to sign it as an ESA. We get into a huge fight over it and whatever make up. She goes home with the dog for winter break. When she comes back the first thing she tells me is do not cut the dogs nails because the vet said not to bc she\u2019s \u201cfearful\u201d of the nail clippers. She doesn\u2019t take the dog out for walks and does nothing to keep the dog\u2019s nails in decent shape. I would be bleeding and bruised constantly from the dog scratching me. So, I decided to cut the dog\u2019s nails and the dog did completely fine. She leaves work early to come scream at me over it and blames me for the dog not being potty trained and having anxiety over nail clippings when this is HER dog even though I feed it and take it out on walks so it\u2019s not cooped up in its kennel all day. That was it for me, so I went to the leasing office and reported the dog. Next thing I know, she texts me that same night to \u201cfeed HER dog\u201d so she can go out and I said no and told her I was not resigning the lease with her. So I talked to the leasing office once again and I was able to be removed from the lease and move out. Now she has no furniture, her rent is double what it was. She has never paid a bill because I was in charge of all that. She tries to call our providers pretending to be me and cancel the bills and put them under her name. Now, changed the locks on her bedroom door when I have possessions in her room. She\u2019s not here for the next few days and I need to get out of this place by this weekend. Guess I need to talk to leasing again because now she has violated the lease 3 times.

You should\u2019ve seen the nails on this dog, no vet would tell anyone not to cut a dog\u2019s nails. She\u2019s just full of herself and thinks she\u2019s taking exceptional care of it.", "Right! And she still continues to blame me for every speck of damage in this household as if she has no blame for it. She\u2019s a complete narcissist and doesn\u2019t care about anything besides the dog and herself.

Other friends that have been trying to convince me to move in with them for a while now.

She didn\u2019t want me involved with the dog at all yet brought it into my space and that\u2019s why it\u2019s all my fault that everything\u2019s wrong with it because it wasn\u2019t to her \u201ctraining standards\u201d (which is completely nonexistent)", "Our lease specifically states you can\u2019t change any locks, so they\u2019ll probably evict her after this since this would be her third lease violation.

She needed a roommate so we decided to move in together and it was mutual respect for the first year and then straight downfall the last 6 months.", "It doesnt look like she actually cares about the dog tho", "Can you get your stuff then? Will the leasing office help you?", "Ouch. Sorry to see it end this way :(", "Seriously depending on what state you live in, If you alert nearby animal shelters, pet stores and animal control they will put her on a no adoption/buy list. It's essentially a registry for animal abusers and neglecters. If she tries to go to a reputable breeder to buy a dog it should pop up so they don't sell to her. The only thing is the pieces of crap who puppy mill and over breed don't care. Good luck."]}
