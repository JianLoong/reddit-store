Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).\n\n\nWhile I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said \"It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way..\". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm \"playing favorites\" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.\n\nWe went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.\n\n\nETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.\n\nAlso. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.", "created_utc": 1673350198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1087lbn/aita_for_getting_my_daughter_a_hotel_room/", "score": 1863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What's extra gross is that they did it when coming back from Shilo's grandparent's funeral. Talk about cruel.\n\nYou're definitely NTA. But also wtf is wrong with Candace if she sees this as playing favorites? Her daughters tried to make yours sleep on the floor for fun. Sounds like the apples don't fall far from the tree. Have you pointed out your daughter is also upset because of the situation and ***she*** is playing favorites?", "NTA\n\nCandace is the one playing favourites.\n\nExpecting your daughter to sleep on the floor is some Cinderella type stuff. \n\nMaybe pull your daughter aside and find out if this is the only thing they\u2019ve done to treat her badly", "Candace is a piece of work. It\u2019s fine for your daughter to sleep on an uncomfortable floor as long as Candaces daughters are comfortable in the bed.\n\nReally?! I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI\u2019m glad you got your daughter her own room. I think you\u2019ve got a problem. Your wife is clearly prioritising her own children to the detriment of your daughter. Making her sleep on the floor sounds like bullying.\n\nYou tell your wife you will not be allowing any further bullying behaviour towards your daughter, and if it happens, you and your daughter will be out of there.", "NTA\n\nWhy did the step sisters think that this was acceptable?  This ain't cinderella.\n\nI'm glad you did what you did.", "NTA. I'm getting some serious Cinderella vibes here because wtf?\n\nYour wife and stepdaughters are toxic. Serious words need to be had here, its not about playing favourites. It's basic human decency ffs.", "NTA. I actually bring flip flops to hotels specifically because I assume hotel floors are so nasty that I don\u2019t want my bare feet to make contact. I\u2019d never sleep on the floor of one. Favoritism would have been getting her her own room after Shiloh mistreated her stepsisters; however it was the reverse. You just took action because she was being bullied. \n\nSorry for your loss, OP. If this comes up again, I\u2019d suggest making sure there\u2019s two sleeping options (two beds, or one bed and a pullout couch that converts) next time and specifically let everyone know that no one is sleeping on the damn floor.", "\"Reward my daughters' bad behavior to your daughter because they are my daughters\"\n\nNTA and both your stepdaughters and wife are", "NTA here, Drizella and anastasia causing problems again eh?", "NTA. If playing favorites means your grieving daughter is not to be unnecessarily subjected to her evil stepsisters\u2019 bullying\u2026then, yeah, own it with pride.   How long have you been married?   Your wife is an asshole, and doesn\u2019t care if you and your daughter are grieving, she\u2019s making more problems with her brats, and accusing YOU and your daughter of being the problem.   She\u2019s STILL bringing up weeks later how YOU mishandled this, and saying as PROOF of that the older brats are upset?!?    Time for some serious thinking", "NTA. Fuck them. They can sleep on the floor. Your daughters grandfather passed.", "Nta. I mean come on lets be real suck it up and sleep on the floor? I didn't see anybody else sleeping on the floor. You made the right call and they need to suck it up and apologize to your daughter lol", "NTA.\n\nYour stepdaughters are horrible for treating your daughter like that. Why should she sleep on the floor while they have an entire bed to themselves? If they were \"so uncomfortable\", they should be the ones sleeping on the floor.

You're \"playing favorites\" by getting your daughter a hotel room, but your wife somehow isn't \"playing favorites\" by making her sleep on the floor and having you stepdaughters take the bed? This is a huge double standard.", "Your step-daughters forced your daughter, who just lost her grandfather, to sleep on the floor. If they actually had a problem sharing the bed with her, they should have asked for a roll-away bed, instead they chose to cruelly bully your child. You reacted appropriately, by removing your daughter from the presence of the bullies and getting her a safe, comfortable space to sleep.\n\nYour step-daughters were awful, but the worst person is your wife. She saw no problem in what her children did to your daughter and objected to you standing up for your daughter. I suggest asking Shiloh if her step-sisters have bullied her or been cruel before this incident, and ask her how her step-mother treats her.\n\nNTA, keep protecting your daughter, and reconsider your marriage.", "NTA- but who thought one bed for 3 adults that clearly don\u2019t get along was a good idea in the first place??", "NTA - sorry for your loss.

You handled this in the best way you could have and the fact that your wife somehow believes they should\u2019ve been rewarded for their behaviour and that your daughter should\u2019ve sucked it up shows just how much she\u2019ll prioritize her biological children. Your father passed away and your wife really sees nothing wrong with creating fights, her behaviour is worse than the stepdaughters. It\u2019s gross that she believes this is more important than your own fathers death.

I think what you did was fair. If they were not going to share with Shiloh then damn right she deserved her own room.", "NTA obviously.  Why wouldn't your wife book a hotel room with 2 double beds?  Why would she even get 3 older teens 1 bed to share?  Common sense isn't so common, I guess. \n\nAnd that's not even touching on the fact your wife gives 0 f*cks that your step daughters were bullying your child, which is another big issue here.", "NTA. She didn't deserve their bullying and you protected her. \n\nSo tell your wife that each family of girls gets their own room, and she happens to have more kids that need to share.

Also hotel room floors are disgusting!", "\ud83d\ude33 your wife is horrible to even expect you to be fine with her daughters bullying yours. It\u2019s really really weird that she justifies the bullying.

Pretty sure this is not the first time they have mistreated your little girl", "NTA\n\nYour Wife is right that this was mis-handled, but by _her_. Arguably you should've involved your wife to speak to the stepdaughters to work out WTF their issue is here.\n\nChances are this is just them not liking your Daughter and (ironically given what your Wife said) knowing she'll play Favourites with _them_, vs your Daughter.\n\nUnbelievable - if she'd said you handled it poorly as she'd have made sure they got on together it'd be fine, but implying that your daughter is somehow \"less than\" and doesn't need a bed....\n\nWell, why didn't one of the stepdaughters sleep on the floor then? One rule for one, another for the other.", "NTA This literally sounds like the beginning of Cinderella, with the evil stepsisters who bully poor little Cinderella and the evil stepmother who enables all of it.

Don\u2019t let Cinderella have to endure the bullying.", "NTA but it seems like your marriage is going to be on the rocks if tour wife thinks your daughter should suck It up and sleep on the floor while her kids get a bed. I see she didn't suggest either of them sleep on a floor. The audacity of her to bring up favorites and favoritism when she wanted tour kid on the floor. How is that fair. Ask her to explain how she isn't showing favorites. Yeah this is not something you take lightly", "NTA I can\u2019t believe your wife tolerated this behavior from her children. Also, she should have made better arrangements from the start. One bed for three people makes no sense when most hotels have two double beds and are happy to provide fold away beds. I would ask your wife why she made such bad arrangements from the start. Did she intend for this to happen?", "NTA but your wife and your step daughter\u2019s callousness and selfishness is peak wickedness in a fairytale and I\u2019d put money on the possibility that this is far from the first time they\u2019ve been bullies then victimised themselves.", "So the child whose grandfather died had to sleep on the floor??? Wtf.\n\nWhen you get opportunity to do so, take Shiloh out just the 2 of you and ask her if anything like this has happened before - I'd be surprised if this was the first time.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Those stepsisters have been reading too many fairytales ... or not enough. Anyway, they were clearly being mean.", "NTA. You solved the problem when they weren\u2019t willing to come up with on one their own.", "Your wife is crazy and clearly doesn't care about your child, NTA and you should discuss this with her more, I wouldn't want to be with someone that doesn't give a shit about my kid.", "NTA You didn't show favourites you showed that bullying gets them nothing but honestly a 16 17 and 19 sharing a bed? But I agree you did the right thing. Why should she sleep on the floor", "NTA. Forced to sleep on the floor? That\u2019s disgusting! Why was there only one bed! Maybe your wife should take the floor. I had step kids that were abusive to me, to my son. You did the right thing, she will remember you as her protector for the rest of her life. She will remember how your wife wouldn\u2019t stop hounding you, and I really really hope your wife sees this thread.", "You were not playing favorites - you were treating each girl equally by ensuring each girl had a bed to sleep in.  Step daughters chose first - that is not your problem.\n\nNTA\n\nDoes your wife usually support the step sisters abusing Shiloh?", "Your wife has blinders on and two nasty little daughters.

Over sleeping situations? I think you need to reevaluate the people in your life because I would never complain to someone especially if their father just passed away. How horrible! Also your wife saying YOU played favorites when she wanted her daughters to get a bed and yours the floor is pretty ironic don\u2019t you think??

I'm sorry, I don't want to assume so much here, but this reads very Cinderella to me. \n\nYour wife was fine with her daughters pulling the comfort thing and saying Cinderella should suck it up for the comfort of her wicked step sisters, that is a red flag and you should address it.

How is making sure your daughter has a bed to sleep in instead of a nasty hotel floor playing favorites?\n\nI would have a very long conversation with her about her favoritism and establish boundaries both with her and her daughters so that a repeat of this situation doesn't happen again.\n\nIf she can't accept that, I would suggest couple's therapy to have an impartial observer help you both move forward. If she refuses or it seems impossible to move forward, you have to ask yourself if a relationship where your daughter is treated like less of a person than hers is one you want to stay in.\n\nI'm sorry that you are going through this and wish you the best of luck.", "Your step daughters were acting like assholes and now they are upset? Good. It was thier actions that led to this so they only have themselves to blame.

Wife and stepdaughters are AH.", "NTA. This would 100% be a Cinderella type story. Imagine: you pass away and Shiloh is in the hands of your wife and her two daughters. Shiloh gets mistreated and abused and your wife lets the step daughters take everything. You need to talk to your wife and try to show her that you weren\u2019t picking favourite but rather her daughters were being brats and trying to kick your daughter out of the bed.

Another poster said that there\u2019s no way this is the first time they\u2019ve been assholes and I\u2019m inclined to agree. Talk to your daughter, stop this bs in its tracks.

Your daughter deserves a bed just like her stepsiblings do.

I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said \"It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way..\". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm \"playing favorites\" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.\n\nWe went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this.

I have 3 older sisters, and cannot imagine being required to sleep with two of them in one bed.  Bad preparation by Candace!", "I thought the same thing before I was even done reading it.", "Classic case of Cinderella.", "That's my question. OP is NTA, but I gotta wonder what's up with Candace's inability to book a double for a night. And where the hell were they staying that a front desk clerk *wouldn't* indicate that there were rooms with two doubles? That way the wicked stepsister could have shared a bed and Shiloh could have the other.", "OP surely was aware that the room had one bed. And if not, why didn\u2019t his wife notice? The adults in this story are all terribly unobservant.", "Oh you are definitely right. She probably would have a cause a scene.  But since it wasn't her daughter she didn't care.", "Right.  Not to mention, Shiloh was also dealing with the death of a family member on top of all of this. It's not just Dad's family.  It was her grandparent. \n\nThis is just so mean and nasty on step mom and step sister's part.", "True. The stepmom would have a harder time being an AH though.", "Same lol... step sisters ganging up on her.. he should've gotten/switched to a 2 bed room. Then they'd be arguing over who is sleeping together or not \ud83d\ude44", "Are you sure they're not bullying your daughter without your knowledge?", "And yet, your wife felt comfortable enough to find normal that YOUR daughter, who is probably mourning her grandfather should sleep on the floor. And her daughters felt totally comfortable to force it on your child. They also feel comfortable to pout and tell you you play favorites when you solved the solution by finding a bed for your child to sleep in. Does your wife and stepchildren think your daughter's name is Cinderella?\n\nYou are NTA for getting her a room. But you should have a serious conversation with your kid to see if more things like these are happening unbeknownst to you. That is NOT NORMAL.", "NTA. Please talk to your daughter (without SM and SDs) to make sure this isn\u2019t the only instance of them bullying her. Either way, you have some serious thinking and decisions to make. You don\u2019t want this to become a habit with them.", "They're not close but they had to sleep in the same bed together, 3 of them in a bed meant for 2??", "You do or your wife and stepdaughters are steamrolling your daughter.  Your not paying attention this is a pattern or your wife would have been mad at her kids not you.", "Sound like your daughter is being bullied and you finally got to see the proof. I would highly suggest not letting this down and figure out what\u2019s really going on.", "This is the case now but what efforts have you and the wife taken to foster better relations between siblings? How long did you two know each other before deciding to enter the lives of each other and your respective children?", "NTA. Definitely getting wicked stepmother vibes. Tell Lady Tremaine she was way out of line with booking a king bed for three teenage girls and then being ok with your daughter sleeping on the floor. Your daughter needs you to be there for her, I have she is going to need you more than ever.", "Sorry but I find it hard to believe this was a one time incident.", "Your wife is clearly an AH though.", "Even if there's no actual fighting (and like others, I'd be really worried your daughter is being bullied), that doesn't sound like a happy or health dynamic for people who live together. It sounds like a cold war. \n\nWhy did you bring people like this into your daughter's life?", "Absolutely getting Cinderella vibes too! Before you know it, she'll be pushed out of her bedroom and into the attic and forced to clean the house top to bottom !", "The whole family dynamic isn't a comfortable fit!\n\nDo we know it was a queen? I was picturing a king. Agreed, a queen is too small for three, but a king isn't. \n\nWe don't know if the hotel had limited options available, especially for adjacent rooms, or how involved the wife was in the decision.", "His wife booked them all in one room. \n\nHe's definitely NTA.", "Ah, he must have edited that in after I posted. His wife is an idiot.", "100% this. especially with both stepsisters being older than daughter & acting this way, there's no way they aren't doing more or worse to daughter. op needs to wake up talk to daughter to see if stepsisters are doing more.", "Yes and it's even more sad OP gets to see the full extent of his wife and stepdaughters' asshole-ness in a time where he and his daughter are grieving.", "Then they could have simply flipped a coin to decide who gets the bed to themselves.", "not in all versions, in the version of the Grimm brothers, for example, he is alive, aware of the mistreatment and does not intervene", "Yes he should've gotten at least 2 beds", "He might not have done the booking but he still went along with it. He also admitted that the girls \"aren't that close\", so expecting them to sleep in one bed is just ridiculous. Given that his father just died + how quickly he got his daughter out, he's far from as big an AH as the Steps, but he could still have prevented this from the start.", "OP had lost a parent.\n\nThe wife should have been looking into these things.\n\nThat's what partners are for.\n\nNTA.", "That is as may be, but he was, or should have been, aware of what was going on.", "He said in the post he was grieving so his wife was in charge for the room arrangements.He might also be responsible for the planning of the funeral so he wouldn't have given much thought about the room arrangements", "True, but those were your friends and you made that choice. Shiloh & stepsisters didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter and it doesn\u2019t sound like they like each other all that much under normal circumstances.", "OP didn\u2019t book the accommodation as they were bereaved - their lovely wife did and booked one big bed rather than even ask for an extra bed to be put in the room. OP you\u2019re NTA here", "Slight difference I think when you're spending your own money as a college student vs your parents' money as a minor. Not saying they couldn't do it but the mentality in the moment for the teenagers is very different.", "That would change things", "I edited. I meant the daughter is nta, but everyone else sucks. The parents should have never booked 1 room with 1 bed for 3 girls. I have 2 sisters and my parents always booked 2 rooms for us. 1 for our eldest sister and 1 with twin beds for my younger sister and I. I understand that the dynamics are different given the fact that my family is not blended. \nThe mom is the AH for booking 1 room and clearly favouring her own kids.\nThe dad also sucks for not pointing out that 3 people shouldn\u2019t be sharing a bed, even a huge bed.\nImo, everyone except the daughter sucks.", "Why? How is dad the asshole?", "Why? Why op sucks for doing what's fair to end the issue fast so he can morn in peace?", "I agree with Mea_Culpa. The SDs would absolutely have forced Shiloh onto the floor and Shiloh wouldn\u2019t have them felt safe to come back to her dad because he \u201cwas strong\u201d and told her to \u201csuck it up.\u201d What OP did instead was show his daughter she ALWAYS has a safe place with dad. He will absolutely take care of her needs and that\u2019s so important. OP good job for taking care of your kid!", "She's turning the blame and stating you're playing favorites, while clearly being the one to actually do so. This whole thing, and her and her childrens attitudes about it, is a giant red flag. I would recommend couples counseling, even just one or two sessions, because we only get a 3000 word or less post, we cant get a complete picture but what we do see is a serious problem and having a professional 3rd party would be helpful here.", "Candance & her daughters are helping only themselves. Watch out for further manipulation while you're grieving and get more angry on your daughters behalf. \n\nNTA. Good luck to you & your daughter\n\nEdit: Regardless of whether Candance expected Shiloh to sleep on the floor originally, she expected Shiloh to 'suck it up' when there was an issue caused by her booking an inappropriate room.\nCandance sucks. \n\nHer daughters suck for not only NOT comforting their grieving step sis, but literally shoving her onto the floor & seeing no issue when they were called out on treating her like a dog.\n\nThey're mad and not talking to you? Good riddance", "Did she really help? She booked spaces that she could only make work if she could count on her kids behaving, and that is not something she can count on clearly.", "You say that Candace didn't expect your daughter to sleep on the floor, but she scolded you while you are grieving and dealing with an upset daughter instead of correcting the other two kids.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this. You are NTA, but you need to find a way to deal with Candace and the kids. Tell her if didn't want to waste money she will correct the children who are causing the problem not everyone else. Also, if tell the girls who caused the issue, next time you'll get a double bedroom and they'll be stuck with their parents if they can't share.", "Well Candace didn't helped, she made things worse by playing favourites and treat YOUR daughter like trash. Do you really think she didn't knew her entitled kids would kick your daughter to sleep on the floor? She made the arrangements, she decided to do this to your daughter. \n\nOP she told you YOUR daughter should \"sucked it up and sleep on the floor\".\n\nShe's not a good stepmother, she's a bully like her children and this is probably not the first time they mistreat your daughter. \n\nY-T-A for letting your daughter live in that toxic environment. The only thing you're doing is giving her some things to talk about in therapy and reason to go NC with you.\nNTA for preventing your daughter to sleep on the floor like YOUR WIFE wanted.", "Your wife is odd for not getting a room with 2 double beds.  3 teenagers shouldn't be sharing a bed.  Parents of 3 biological kids woulda done that and made the youngest share one and given the oldest their own.", "Not only that, but Shiloh just lost her grandpa. She's already grieving, and to get bullied on top? Sick.\n\nOP was absolutely NTA. But the other three were awful in a time of need. No compassion at all. That's infinitely worse than giving his daughter her own room.", "First OP is NTA.\n\nSecond, I completely agree! 3 people to one bed? I know OP keeps saying girls, but these girls are almost full grown adults (I think one already is). Maybe it was a King sized bed but a room with 2 queens typically costs the same amount and would have solved the issue. Especially since you can usually request that cot at the front desk even if there isn't one in the room. Candace definitely sucks and is an AH here. \n\nOP needs to talk with his daughter and find out how else Candace has set things up for her wicked step sisters to bully her.", "That\u2019s what I want to know", "how is one to be sure of this without their own knowledge of it?", "My guess is if we ask his daughter how the home is the answer would be very different", "Even if it was a king, sleeing with others in one bed isn't something everyone's comfortable with. He should have cleared that up with the girls beforehand. Doesn't make him an AH though, just bad planning by whomever made that decision.", "According to the edit the wife booked the rooms on her own.", "That's a very generous interpretation. I'm more inclined to think of her as terrible than stupid, but I guess the two are not mutually exclusive.", "Apparently she did", "He was mourning the death of his father, a bit trivial to keep up with what's happening with hotel bookings, especially if the wife said she'll take care of it", "That's true, but even if they don't get along they're not five. They are old enough to tell their parents they don't want to share, or to suck it up for a little while. It wasn't a permanent solution. Although it's also true that we don't know if they did say something before the trip or if they knew about the arrangement.", "Ah, that\u2019s an important detail. Definitely NTA. Wife was in the wrong for getting too small a room.", "I agree that booking two rooms, or at least a room with 2 beds was the better choice, but OP says that was his wife's doing. He was busy getting ready for his father's funeral.", "I agree. Especially about the room, plenty of hotels do family rooms, could be a double and a set of bunks or I've known places that do a triple rm with 3 single beds. Candace made no effort when she just went ahead and booked 2 standard dbls for 5 ppl. \n\nOp needs to step up and end the bullying of his daughter and also to hold his horrid wife accountable for her attitude and behaviour.", "He says specifically they didn't get the hotel rooms until after the funeral and at the time they took 2 rooms, so \\*shrug\\*. Methinks his edit is just to make him look better because he doesn't want to take responsibility for his part.", "You\u2019re assuming that they didn\u2019t complain and the mother told them to shut up. Which, considering her awful reaction to Shiloh is *highly* likely.", "I mean, mourning doesn't just stop after the funeral is finished... but yeah, possibly, not many people want themselves to look like an a-hole haha", "If his wife booked the hotel rooms I think it\u2019s totally unreasonable to expect a grieving person to bother checking that their wife used common bloody sense & got a room with at least 2 bed for 3 non-related teenage girls. He probably just\nassumed that the girls room had seperate beds, I mean, would you expect a loved one to do this?  OP is NTA, all the others are though. \n\nIf I was in the girls situation I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like to sleep with some random non-related 3rd person in a small bed (that would make physical contact non-negotiable) either. However I, and most decent people, would solve the situation by either paying for my own room or sleeping on the floor myself, not forcing some poor kid who\u2019s just lost their grandfather to do so.\n\nI hope for the kids sake that they\u2019re either poor or that the wife was grieving too cause otherwise it\u2019s a really shitty thing to do to try and force them to all sleep in a bed together."]}
