Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).\n\n\nWhile I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said \"It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way..\". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm \"playing favorites\" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.\n\nWe went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.\n\n\nETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.\n\nAlso. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.\n\n\n\nETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.\n\nAnd also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.", "created_utc": 1673350198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1087lbn/aita_for_getting_my_daughter_a_hotel_room/", "score": 26506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What's extra gross is that they did it when coming back from Shilo's grandparent's funeral. Talk about cruel.\n\nYou're definitely NTA. But also wtf is wrong with Candace if she sees this as playing favorites? Her daughters tried to make yours sleep on the floor for fun. Sounds like the apples don't fall far from the tree.

I actually bring flip flops to hotels specifically because I assume hotel floors are so nasty that I don\u2019t want my bare feet to make contact. I\u2019d never sleep on the floor of one. Favoritism would have been getting her her own room after Shiloh mistreated her stepsisters; however it was the reverse. You just took action because she was being bullied. \n\nSorry for your loss, OP. If this comes up again, I\u2019d suggest making sure there\u2019s two sleeping options (two beds, or one bed and a pullout couch that converts) next time and specifically let everyone know that no one is sleeping on the damn floor.", "\"Reward my daughters' bad behavior to your daughter because they are my daughters\"\n\nNTA and both your stepdaughters and wife are", "NTA here, Drizella and anastasia causing problems again eh?", "NTA.

This is a huge double standard.", "Your step-daughters forced your daughter, who just lost her grandfather, to sleep on the floor. If they actually had a problem sharing the bed with her, they should have asked for a roll-away bed, instead they chose to cruelly bully your child. You reacted appropriately, by removing your daughter from the presence of the bullies and getting her a safe, comfortable space to sleep.\n\nYour step-daughters were awful, but the worst person is your wife. She saw no problem in what her children did to your daughter and objected to you standing up for your daughter.

You handled this in the best way you could have and the fact that your wife somehow believes they should\u2019ve been rewarded for their behaviour and that your daughter should\u2019ve sucked it up shows just how much she\u2019ll prioritize her biological children. Your father passed away and your wife really sees nothing wrong with creating fights, her behaviour is worse than the stepdaughters.

I see she didn't suggest either of them sleep on a floor. The audacity of her to bring up favorites and favoritism when she wanted tour kid on the floor. How is that fair. Ask her to explain how she isn't showing favorites. Yeah this is not something you take lightly", "NTA I can\u2019t believe your wife tolerated this behavior from her children.

Did she intend for this to happen?", "NTA but your wife and your step daughter\u2019s callousness and selfishness is peak wickedness in a fairytale and I\u2019d put money on the possibility that this is far from the first time they\u2019ve been bullies then victimised themselves.", "So the child whose grandfather died had to sleep on the floor???

Good. It was thier actions that led to this so they only have themselves to blame.

Another poster said that there\u2019s no way this is the first time they\u2019ve been assholes and I\u2019m inclined to agree. Talk to your daughter, stop this bs in its tracks.

Your daughter deserves a bed just like her stepsiblings do.

I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said \"It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way..\". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm \"playing favorites\" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.\n\nWe went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this.
