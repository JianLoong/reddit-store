If we are made to take them off?\n\nWe should just dress up and wear slip on comfortable  shoes then??\n\nFrankly? If im going to be asked to someones home, for say dinner or an occasion? Then be made to remove my shoes before going in. Being forced to walk around in slippers or barefeet?\n\nThen don't invite me. I don't want to come to your house. And depending on our \"friendship\" ? Don't bother. Cause i think making guests go barefoot hecause you are  paranoid about your floor being clean? You care more about flooring then your guests being comfortable? \n\nFloors are for walking on. Humans have evolved to wear shoes. Im not going to walk around in stupid slippers or barefeet for anyone.\n\nNow dirty workboots etc? Well... Doh...of course you take them off. Step in dogpoo? Yeahm.. doh\n... Common sense.\n\nBut just \"all shoes off in my house because thats my rule\" get stuffed.", "Agree", "Wtf is silly about not wanting people to make your floors dirty?", "Umm..\n\nNo.\n\nPeople are obviously allowed their own house rules, but turning your nose up at having to take your shoes off at a home with clean, dry floors vs dirty wet floors that no-one else has to aren't comparable. \n\nIt's polite not to wear shoes in most people's houses for a number of reasons, but singling people out purposely because you don't like that you have to in their home is ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "Some cultures find it\u2019s rude to wear shoes inside. Even schools require a change of shoes.\n\nIn this case, the OP wants their floors to remain clean, hence no shoes. The in-laws were being petty & want them to not wear shoes on a dirty floor. Hard pass to stay at a place one is going to be humiliated. \n\nThe OP is NTA.", "That doesn't work in this situation.\n\nAllowing ALL GUESTS except two, to wear shoes and track in snow, mud and dirt all over the floor, but expecting two to go barefoot/socketed feet, is abhorrent. Bad manners. Out of order! Preposterous!\n\nIt's even, dare I say it? A targeted petty attack to single out and abuse two people who don't want to step in SHIT FROM OUTSIDE in their own home, that they maintain as a shoeless domicile?\n\nHow come it's okay for everyone to wear shoes but the two people who keep a shoeless house for SANITARY REASONS?\n\nThat's basically saying 'oh, well I don't understand why you have this rule for your house at alllllllll, totallllly don't get it at allllll, but come over and be the only bare feet people in an entire party, for an entire night, with wet muddy floors!! \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02' like ffs? \n\nThe fuck does' your house your rules' even mean in this context? It's okay to abuse and belittle people if it's in your house? Targeted abuse and harassment is okay if it's in your house?", "But it\u2019s not a rule, because then it would apply to everyone but they only want to OP to do it? You are correct that OP obviously isn\u2019t wanted or liked and should leave, but he should definitely take any gifts for anyone with him.

Doh.....", "Lovie. I've owned about 8 houses\ud83d\ude03 built 3\ud83d\ude03\nThe take your shoes off thing doesn't factor into our life. At all. Floors get dirty? So you mop!

Leave.", "So\u2026 you say the in laws targeted them and were petty and you clearly see the abuse and recognize it, but say that the abused people here were TA?? \nDamn. You sound like somebody nobody wants over at their house, neither with shoes or without.", "That point stands for inlaws too in OPs house.\nBut they don't leave either.\n\nThe difference is OP has a request for all, not a petty targeted action that would leave guests with dirty wet feet (yuck).\n\nI honestly can't see how inlaws aren't the AH to you but OP is, it's baffling.", "NTA. In Canada, taking off your shoes indoors is normal and expected, I don\u2019t understand why people are okay with people tracking dirt all through their house.", "NTA, but they're telling you very clearly that you're not welcome, yes it is a petty punishment for how you handle your house. That's your point to leave", "NTA, where I grew up, you take your shoes off. It's a sign of respect. Also, there was no way your shoes were clean unless you carried an extra set of indoor shoes, which, if you do, would be fine.", "NTA. Just to note, in many places where it is normal to take shoes off in homes, people have house-shoes and provide clean house-shoes to guests.\n\nDid you challenge them and ask them if it was a joke or a punishment on the way out of the door? I would really consider whether to invite them to your home again. Maybe socialize in restaurants.", "Why do people not take shoes off in houses in whatever country you're from?\n\nIt's simple...  you go outside, you put your shoes on. You go inside and you take them off so you don't track whatever dirt/show/shit/etc that is stuck to your shoes around the house. \n\nYour country is full of savages.", "NTA. People who think it's okay to wear street shoes inside are bizarre. This incident does not alter my opinion.", "NTA\n\nEveryone should follow the rides of the house, and what everyone else is doing.\n\nIf the house rules are 'no shoes', then you don't want one person tracking in mud and mess and getting the otherwise clean floors dirty.\n\nIf the house rules are 'shoes on' then taking your shoes off will just result in dirty feet from the mess from everyone else wearing shoes.\n\nSomeone having a 'shoes on' home, yet demanding one guest take their shoes off is nothing more than a petty revenge being aimed at one person, and an idiotic form of bullying by a selfish asshole. Because they decided following your rules in your home was beneath them and insulting to them, they are being obvious in insulting you back.\n\nHonestly, if someone I know was being so petty about something like this, I would have little hesitation in turning around and walking back out - if they wish to make it so clear you are not welcome, I would take them at their word, and make everyone else know exactly why you are leaving. If they want to be petty, so can you...", "NTA, thats just weird type of bullying towards you", "NTA. -  curious about what your wife said/did?", "Please leave. That's just petty as hell.

Do you and your wife have kids?\n\nThey are being exclusionary, which is different from a house rule that applies to everyone.

Wet or snowy you for sure need to take your shoes off!", "It's also the most normal thing to do in Denmark, where I am from. I always considered it odd in American movies, that they would just walk in straight from outside, no matter the weather and walk all over their house in (what must be) dirty shoes.

Sometimes hosts offer you to keep them on (not in winter) but usually protocol is to take them off.", "I don't want your stinky sweaty feet on my floor.

I rather have dirt that is easy to see to clean than your sweat smelling up my house.", "Hate to break it to you, unless shoes are fresh out of the sterilizing wash then they are all absolutely disgusting and not welcome in my home. It has less to do with cleaning and more to do with not wanting generally neglected poop ridden shoes tracking harmful bacteria on the floors of my home that my small children play on. I have plenty of shoe booties for those who refuse to remove shoes. I had two people refuse the booties as they marched straight past our \"please remove shoes\" sign on door and across our living room rug we play on with our children daily. They haven't gotten an invite since that incident. It's one thing to wear outside shoes on easy to clean/sanitize hardwoods but my nice Persian rugs?!
