Enjoy.", "I am considering the \u201cno shoes\u201d thing when we get new carpet. We currently have ice blue carpet in our living and dining room (not my choice, we moved in with FIL to take care of him). The carpet was/is atrocious because we host everything! Interesting to read the opinions. I just want carpet in my living room though.", "NTA this is a very disrespectful behavior from them. Worst is that they probably think they're being clever. \nJust leave and tell them you'll remove your shoes when it will be the rule for everyone.", "NTA but you are clearly being singled out.  There's more to the story here OP isn't saying.", "I'm the only one in my family that doesn't wear shoes at home. But when I visit or they visit me (rare because I live in another country), no one gets upset over shoes and everyone complies to whatever rules the house has. I think this issue goes deeper than shoes and they're trying to make the OP not feel welcomed by being passive aggressive.", "Apparently, some older-minded White Americans believe allowing someone to step barefoot in one's house implies and necessitates intimate familiarity. And somehow they are overconfident about not tracking wet mud or dry sand indoors.", "I\u2019ve been wearing a generic pair of shoes, similar to oofos, around the house most of the time lately. I came out of the shower without them, having left them in the other room, and it totally felt so weird walking barefoot because my feet apparently love the arch support of those shoes. I would definitely be someone schlepping along house shoes to wear, so my feet(and back!) wouldn\u2019t ache after a visit elsewhere. Some people really do need to be able to have shoes on at almost all times.", "> People actually wear shoes in the house?\n\nYes. I can personally attest to witnessing various Americans wear their shoes indoors. Before any annoying Redditors try to gotcha me, no it is not 100% of White Americans, but it is most certainly well and above 0%.", "Seriously? As I said I am Canadian. It is snowy or muddy about 9 months of the year. No one wants that in their house.", "Uh socks are a thing? You take your shoes off and walk around in your socks.", "Lol, yeah but you\u2019re also not *seeing* like 90% of the muck that you are walking through and subsequently tracking all over your/peoples home(s)\u2026 you know, like animal or human piss, spit, vomit, ejaculate(yes, it\u2019s out there!), etc etc etc. And that\u2019s only a bit of bodily stuff. Think of all the unseen chemicals you\u2019re continuously traipsing through in parking lots and such\u2026 freon, coolant, oil, gasoline, other industrials, etc etc etc.", "I don't have the link handy, but I once saw Chrissy Teigen tweet a photo of her husband John Legend allegedly napping on their home sofa complete with his shoes on.", "It really is amusing that White Americans are the most infamous in the world for wearing shoes indoors, but somehow, all Canadians including White Canadians agree not to wear shoes indoors.", "> my Midwest family has everyone take their shoes off\n\nYou must live with a changing subculture because Midwesterners in my experience are rather comfortable with wearing shoes indoors.", "It\u2019s not the norm, in the sense that most people do it. But it\u2019s not seen as odd or inappropriate if someone does.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know why anyone is downvoting you. It\u2019s a fair question.", "Sounds more like a shitty meter maid", "I'm from the Chicago area and we take our shoes off when going inside, especially when we are guests somewhere. We might wear our shoes if we're only there for a short time or running in to get something, but in general shoes are off. I don't know anyone who just lounges in their house with their outside shoes on.", "Missouri girl. I don't take off my shoes immediately at home. I usually keep my shoes on when visiting unless they're wet or dirty or I'm at my sister's house. However I grew up in the country with livestock and would have zero problems feeding the horse or going next door barefoot. I would have zero problems with hosts requiring me to wear shoes or be barefoot.  I would have a problem with hosts requiring me to wear their slippers. Just let me know in advance and I'll bring my own.", "Take them off or leave. You've no other option.\n\nYour question made my smile at the pettiness of some people. Obviously they didn't like complying with your rules. So they tried to humiliate you.\n\nIncidentally, we absolutely don't allow shoes in the house. So I agree with your house rules.\n\nYou're basically better off not wasting your time with such trivial people. They have done you a favour.", "maybeTA\n\nis this just a protracted fight thats bled over into the holiday season?\n\nshoes off is imo correct but it shouldnt come to this", "NTA. They are definitely being petty and discriminatory against you. I recommend declines any invitations into their home in the future", "NTA wearing outdoor shoes in a house is disgusting, ewww", "NTA, fucking wow. What spectacular children they are. Yeah i would refuse to attend parties with only children, they don't seem like fun. The point of removing shoes is to keep the floors cleaner, depends on the place though. I'm American, literally born to generational hunters and butchers in the north. In my home I take my shoes off, I have indoor slippers. At the hunting cabin nobody cares. It's cold and expected to be dirty, we just do our best to clean it up and shake the dirt / snow off before we come in. \n\nIf the hosts said no shoes, cool man. If the hosts don't care that's fine too. It's on the owners of the home, if you don't like their rules then leave? One of my uncles will never allow hats in the house. He thinks it's rude, hats are protection from the elements which are not needed indoors. Nobody fights him on this and he also doesn't enforce it anywhere else. Basically you're right, they're AH and some of the pettiest people I have ever heard of.", "NTA, but why did you stay at a place with hostile relatives?", "NTA. When we rented a room at the inlaws our friends took their shoes off at our bedroom bc they knew we took them off inside. We didn't even ask they just followed suit. Lol", "At that point the relation with he inlaws would be dead or going dead.", "Don't any of your guests wear socks?", "Well, if you wear the shoes the dirt doesn't bother :9", "It's a places that get snow vs places that don't get snow kinda thing from my observation. Living in the southwest where we barely get rain everyone just kinda keeps shoes on if they are not done for the day. When I visit the north east everyone takes their shoes off at the door", "I agree but what is strange here is that they only make OP and his wife do it......not everyone else.  If EVERYONE had to take their shoes off I would 100% agree, but everyone except these 2 people???  Does not make sense.", "no literally anywhere w snow figured it out real quick (and plenty of places without)", "That's great and all, but it's extremely uncommon in the US. You just wouldn't expect that here. In 32 years of life, I think I've been in exactly 2 \"no shoe\" households. So, no. In the US nobody is running around with indoor shoes or slippers. I have never even heard of such a thing.\n\n(Not saying this to condemn OP. This is just 100% not a thing here.)", "I have permanent twndon damage in my ankle.  This injury cannot be repaired without a serious risk to my current mobility,  so I just muddle through because I don't want to not be able to walk if at all possible.  I cannot walk easily without shoes to maintain the position of my foot. If it was requested, I'd possible side eye the host, but I'd go along with it, but would be in serious pain later on from the strain to the tendon", "I'm French and I'd say a lot of times people don't take their shoes off. By default I don't take them off unless I'm asked to, and I prefer when guests don't take them off when they're at my place.", "sonova! that would set me off", "(Eastern Canada here) We always bring indoor shoes to parties - my kid's Brownie troupe even made shoe bags for their sewing badges one year. It's just a Thing You Do when the ground outside is covered in snow or mud 8 months of the year.", "Definitely.", "Ok? Nothing in this post states that they are in Canada. They specify that NO ONE ELSE in their family follow this stupid practice so most likely they aren\u2019t in Canada. They are probably in a place where it is perfectly easy to not get your shoes covered in shit and mud and snow. Yet they force their guests to be uncomfortable. And now they get turnaround. They deserve it and they are YTA.", "It\u2019s an asshole move to force someone to walk in socks.", "Also a maritime Canadian. You NEVER assume you're leaving your shoes on. Some people might tell you not to worry, but they'll usually do that when a guest starts to take off their shoes or before they get a chance. Most people don't bring slippers but some people who need more stability or wear orthotics or whatever may bring indoor shoes/slippers. You never just track the mud and snow in. That's rude as hell.\n\nAnd damn near every house you'd visit would have warm socks or slippers they'd probably be glad to lend you if you needed. Weve also been known to keep lots of fuzzy blankets on hand :)", "Noooo!", "I was responding to a poster that said anyone anywhere forcing people to not wear shoes is the asshole. \n\nBut also, no, people are not the asshole for asking for people to take the shoes off in their clean house and the OP specifically mentioned snow and honestly, I have noticed that northern US states are weird about this, even though they have as much reason to have this rule as Canadians. \n\nThe ILs are pretty and absolutely assholes for making OP trek through their gross floors without shoes.", "Again this is a huge cultural/location difference, I think. I hate socks. Truly hate them but I wear them because snow and cold are worse. People wear socks because the elements require it.", "makes alot of sense when theres 3ft of snow between destinations\n\nnorthern states tend to do this also", "Just goes to show that it really is about culture and not skin colour!", "Nobody from BC hydro comes inside to read the meter", " No the ILs are not. The ILs are forcing OP to do the same thing that OP does to the ILs. OP doesn\u2019t like being forced to take off their shoes despite the fact that OP has the same rule in their own home.", "Wisconsin here and we absolutely take our shoes off. No one wants to constantly clean a snowy/muddy floor up", "3 feet of snow is extremely rare in my part of Canada", "To be fair this is when I was growing up. Hopefully things have changed since then. For the most part they could do the reading outside but it was more accurate or something to do it inside. I just remember my mum cursing them and their dirty winter boots whenever they came inside.", "But OP makes everyone do it and that means there is no snow, dirt on their floors. Being the only person wearing socks while everyone else is wearing shoes/boots is very different than being asked to take off your shoes in a house where everyone else is asked to as well. In fact, it can literally be dangerous to the OP because they risk having their feet stepped on by someone in shoes.", "Who cares?  According to this thread and the \u201cno shoes in the house\u201d crowd the lack of visible mud and snow doesn\u2019t matter, shoes track in all sorts of invisible stuff. So OP is forcing people to walk in all sorts of stuff but doesn\u2019t want to do the same in other homes. Turnabout is fair play.", "And incidentally there are plenty of things you can kick in socked feet even if no one else has shoes on. OP doesn\u2019t care about forcing others to take that risk. Again, turnabout!", "OP doesn't let anyone track snow or mud into their house so it is not the same. The other people are not walking through anything. \n\nAnd OO specifically mentions snow, so it is a factor."]}
