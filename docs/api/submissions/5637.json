Are they really *that* upset that you have those rules set at your house? They are being ridiculously petty, what wonderful holiday spirit they are exuding.

If this becomes a pattern with the in-laws, bring slippers with the hard soles.", "NTA - they are being petty.  I would not under any circumstances take my shoes off in their house.

Leave. Thats clear. You arent liked. So go. \n\nPetty or not? Everyone is obviously over your rule and want to let you know it.\n\nI wouldn't be coming to your house either and i probably wouldn't bother with you much overall. \n\nIts ALL silly!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is isolating you and petty.", "Can i just ask ...\n\nWhy do people even dress nicely and bother with matching shoes to clothes and bother with buying nice shoes at all? If we are made to take them off?\n\nWe should just dress up and wear slip on comfortable  shoes then??\n\nFrankly? If im going to be asked to someones home, for say dinner or an occasion? Then be made to remove my shoes before going in. Being forced to walk around in slippers or barefeet?\n\nThen don't invite me. I don't want to come to your house. And depending on our \"friendship\" ? Don't bother. Cause i think making guests go barefoot hecause you are  paranoid about your floor being clean? You care more about flooring then your guests being comfortable? \n\nFloors are for walking on. Humans have evolved to wear shoes. Im not going to walk around in stupid slippers or barefeet for anyone.", "Agree", "Wtf is silly about not wanting people to make your floors dirty?", "Umm..\n\nNo.\n\nPeople are obviously allowed their own house rules, but turning your nose up at having to take your shoes off at a home with clean, dry floors vs dirty wet floors that no-one else has to aren't comparable. \n\nIt's polite not to wear shoes in most people's houses for a number of reasons, but singling people out purposely because you don't like that you have to in their home is ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "Some cultures find it\u2019s rude to wear shoes inside. Even schools require a change of shoes.\n\nIn this case, the OP wants their floors to remain clean, hence no shoes. The in-laws were being petty & want them to not wear shoes on a dirty floor. Hard pass to stay at a place one is going to be humiliated. \n\nThe OP is NTA.", "That doesn't work in this situation.\n\nAllowing ALL GUESTS except two, to wear shoes and track in snow, mud and dirt all over the floor, but expecting two to go barefoot/socketed feet, is abhorrent. Bad manners. Out of order! Preposterous!\n\nIt's even, dare I say it? A targeted petty attack to single out and abuse two people who don't want to step in SHIT FROM OUTSIDE in their own home, that they maintain as a shoeless domicile?\n\nHow come it's okay for everyone to wear shoes but the two people who keep a shoeless house for SANITARY REASONS?\n\nThat's basically saying 'oh, well I don't understand why you have this rule for your house at alllllllll, totallllly don't get it at allllll, but come over and be the only bare feet people in an entire party, for an entire night, with wet muddy floors!! \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02' like ffs? \n\nThe fuck does' your house your rules' even mean in this context? It's okay to abuse and belittle people if it's in your house? Targeted abuse and harassment is okay if it's in your house?", "But it\u2019s not a rule, because then it would apply to everyone but they only want to OP to do it? You are correct that OP obviously isn\u2019t wanted or liked and should leave, but he should definitely take any gifts for anyone with him. I wonder if you even own your own your home for such a tone deaf comment", "OF COURSE ITS TARGETTED AND PETTY!!! Lol ... Thats the point. They most definitely WERE making a point...... Doh.....", "Lovie. I've owned about 8 houses\ud83d\ude03 built 3\ud83d\ude03\nThe take your shoes off thing doesn't factor into our life. At all. Floors get dirty? So you mop! Woo hoo.\n\nBy all means insist people take shoes off if you want. But plenty of people will be freakin annoyed at you.\n\nYes... What tgese people did was petty. But they clearly wanted to make a point. Their perogative.\n\nDont like it? Leave.", "So\u2026 you say the in laws targeted them and were petty and you clearly see the abuse and recognize it, but say that the abused people here were TA?? \nDamn. You sound like somebody nobody wants over at their house, neither with shoes or without.", "That point stands for inlaws too in OPs house.\nBut they don't leave either.\n\nThe difference is OP has a request for all, not a petty targeted action that would leave guests with dirty wet feet (yuck).\n\nI honestly can't see how inlaws aren't the AH to you but OP is, it's baffling."]}
