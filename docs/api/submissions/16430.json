But I think he crossed a line here and if you want to have new relationships you should figure out that line. If your ex didn't want a scene in front of the kid, he shouldn't have come over drunk trying to come in. If I were your new BF I would have done the same because I know this wouldn't be the last time and it would be un needed drama and trust issues. It's not easy to think clearly or make quick decisions at that time of day, but honestly I would have not let him in.", "YTA Your boyfriend is right. You should have refused entry (and call him a cab). This is not a situation you should expose your kid too. I also understand your boyfriend being disgruntled over you offering your home and your BED.

You can say your new bf isn\u2019t/ wasn\u2019t, but when you establish boundaries with new bf\u2019s blessing, then let ex push beyond them, that\u2019s exactly what new bf is going to feel like.\n\nI get wanting to remain friendly with ex, especially with a child involved, but you\u2019re going to need to learn how to tell him no, and actually mean no, before getting in another relationship.", "YTA will you accept the situation if you were at your ex boyfriend place ? Nopeb I doubt it. \n\nCo parenting is a thing, but letting your ex husband sleep in your bed.... what did you expect otherwise than a breakup ???", "I'm going with YTA because it sounds like from what you've said, the break up wasn't over this specific issue it's just that this specific issue was the final straw.  \n\nYou and your husband only split up last year and it's clear that neither of you has truly taken the time and space you need to get over it and be whole people without having drama with each other.  An amicable split doesn't mean you are your ex husbands shoulder to drunkenly cry on,  and it does not mean you allow him to invade your house and bed whenever he feels like it.  \n\nYou ex boyfriend clearly saw that you are still too wrapped up in drama with your ex husband to be in a new relationship and took the only sensible measures for him to live his best life.  \n\nYou're not an asshole in the general sense of the word. It can be hard to realise exactly how dramatic and enmeshed things are when you're in the midst of it and still feel responsibility for actions and emotions of someone you were with for a decade.  But they aren't your responsibility any more and you need to put yourself and your son first before you enter another relationship.  That's why YTA in this situation- to yourself,  your son and your ex boyfriend. \n\nYour ex husband is the biggest asshole by the way,  but that wasn't the question.\n\nEdit: I think one question all the NTAs are neglecting to ask is -why did OP feel the need to answer the phone to her ex at 4.30am in the first place? Car trouble? Why is that her problem? Drunk and sad? Why is that her problem to lend an ear to? There are so many boundaries that should have been in place before the drunken ex husband got in his car.", "YTA. Why would you let him crawl into the bed you share with another guy?

Why the hell would you let a drunk into your home--with a young child--at 4am, instead of, say, calling the police?", "Reminder to you, OP: being supportive of your ex does NOT mean you have to accomodate for his needs or coddle his emotions. \n\nDo NOT allow him to play you like a sad violin.

That'd have been nice for your kid to wake up to and a great image of a dad that might be hard to correct. Yes, that's on your ex's shoulders, sure, but that's the problem with divorces: you no longer have a say in how the other behaves and you just have to deal as best you can with how they behave, even in a situation like this.\n\nI do agree with one commentator that you need to have a conversation with your ex that he never ever drives drunk again, because next time you will call the cops on him, and if you find out he drives drunk or even intoxicated with the kid you'll make sure he'll lose custody.\n\nAs for your now-ex-bf, what a loser for being \"disrespected\" by your ex sleeping off his drunken ass in a bed that you were not in.

I get it.\n\nYou tried to do the right thing and in the moment didn't think about calling a cab, which is just human and an honest mistake/oversight because you had a lot going on right then. The cab companies (all 2 of them in my city lol) don't even have late/overnight hours so it might not have been an actual option anyway. You did the best you could to make sure your child's father was safe (not out driving drunk!)\n\nI'm sorry your relationship ended over this.

This may lead to situations where you compromise, do something you wouldn't want to do, in order to maintain amicable relationship with your ex for the benefit of you child.

I understand not wanting to make a drunk 34yo aggressive because you have a child in the house. I\u2019d let the dude sleep and then rip him a new one and use this unacceptable behaviour to set stricter boundaries. Guilt trip him into something if I must. \n\nWould it be better if he showed up and started ringing the bell, screaming and banging the door? It would wake the kid at best or scare the hell out of him. Keep the kid out of it then sort things out as adults at a different time.

I think you did a good job in difficult circumstances of keeping everyone safe and not affecting your kid's day at school or more long-term mental health. Not being struck by every possible solution when woken up at 4:30am is not AH behaviour, that's just being a human. My feeling is your kid's dad put you in bad situation, and your more recent boyfriend has decided he's going to see it as something it wasn't and get angry about the situation he's imagined. I could see that it's possible (wrt your recent bf) that he wasn't feeling like he could cope with a relationship with you right now in the context of your current boundary issues with your ex, and that's a legitimate decision he can make, but saying you disrespected him in this situation simply isn't true, and makes something rough that you are going through about him a bit more than I am comfortable with.\n\nAbout the boundary issues that you mention, and other people seem to feel are central, I still don't think you're the AH here. Someone can be (and almost always is) an AH by breaking boundaries themselves, but I don't personally think you can call anyone an AH for not having worked out yet how to maintain a boundary that someone else is trying to break. It's definitely a skillset you need to learn, but for your own wellbeing. The fact that you are aware of that particularly makes this the case, as is the fact that you are staying actively aware of how your kid is affected by both the boundary-crossing and your response. You're not a bad person for still learning how to handle this. Good luck!", "[deleted]", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to, but it\u2019s right to worry about exs safety on behalf or your kid.

Not that you could have done anything about it. You did right in avoiding a scene in front of your child and staying on the couch.

And how many times did you sit on the couch while he was in bed (drunk or not) over the last 11 years?

They are not made with a drunk person at 4:30am, within your child's earshot.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the BF is a loss in the long run. His solutions weren't solutions to your concerns for your child. They were about his ego more than anything.\n\nDocument every interaction with your ex. Write it down. Note every time he interacts with you and your child, particularly noting when he is intoxicated.\n\nFind a lawyer. (Look for programs to help moms with custody issues if you can't afford one.)

You're being prepared. If he is able to grow up and handle things better, great! If he isn't, you are ready to protect yourself and your child. \n\nFind a therapist to help you talk this through and get your own head in a good space.

It was a bad situation and there were other problems with the now-ex-BF that probably contributed to the decision, but on it's own I would still have personally taken a deep breath and tried to hear her out more than he probably did. I also don't blame him if there were extenuating circumstances and he just didn't feel invested enough in the relationship to soldier through which I think is fine, especially early in a relationship. Bad situation, the situation sucks for everyone (SSE?) but I don't think anyone sucks. I mean, your ex-husband yes, but neither you or your ex-bf.", "Stop gender defending and being sexist. She mentions she constantly allows her ex husband to cross boundaries. If this is a recurring situation and she does nothing about it, she is clearly the AH.", "This is a very good point. OP\u2019s first priority was her son at that time. If she didn\u2019t let him in, a. He could cause a scene which would have woken the son and he would have seen his dad in an unforgiving light and that\u2019s the best case scenario. B. Ex husband would have driven drunk either back to his place or just around hurting who knows home and possibly even himself. \n\nOP did what she thought was best for her kid and I can\u2019t exactly call her TA for that.", "This. If my kids dad showed up drunk I would have lost my mind had my kid woke up and saw him in that state. I think OP was put in quite a pickle and it sucks because it seems like no matter the outcome, a cab being called for him or not, the new boyfriend still wouldn\u2019t have liked it. \n\nStarting new relationships while you have a alcoholic as a co parent is very very hard, just saying. Not sure that\u2019s what the deal is here but she also had to protect her kid in that moment so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So your significant other would be cool if your ex came over and crawled in your bed?  Because that\u2019s a gross violation of the new relationship boundaries (unless it\u2019s an open relationship).\n\nI\u2019m trying to do the mental gymnastics to see how you arrived at \u201csee it as something it wasn\u2019t\u201d and \u201ca situation he imagined\u201d \u201cnot true she disrespected him\u201d.\n\nThis is some crazy pandering gibberish right here. She stomped on her new relationship and is obviously not ready for a new one.", "Nope, this is not on her ex-boyfriend. That was a new relationship, and not only did he not have any obligation, I\u2019d argue that it would be very inappropriate.", "I agree. The YTA posters are just immature/would be insecure in the same situation. I wouldn't care, I trust my partner", "I'd say much the same thing apart from the sentiment that it feels intimate. To me, the  situation seems intimidating for OP, not intimate. Jumping to the conclusion that this might lead to her having sex with her ex husband is farther from my mind than the possibility that he might sexually assault her.", "Especially as they share a child. The ex isn\u2019t going to just disappear into the ether unfortunately.", "Only egirls of reddit can up to this conclusion..she mentions that ex husband constantly doesn't respect boundaries and never did anything about that. This wasn't a one time thing and the ex bf isn't forced to being a 3rd wheel just becaude OP doesn't want to accept she divorcex her ex husband.", "Disagree about the \u201cdammed if you do\u201d. OP didn\u2019t force or coerce ex to drive over. She told him no, he drove over anyway, and she opened the door.\n\nTell him he\u2019s not allowed in. He can\u2019t stay there. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem he drove drunk, and it\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem to get him home.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve had called the cops on him for drunk driving, so the whole \u201cgetting home\u201d thing would have been moot.\n\nEither way, this isn\u2019t a catch 22. Say no and stick to no.", "There's a Dua Lipa song about this right?\n\n\nSomething about don't pick up the phone you know he's drunk and alone...", "Where does OP say that? I can\u2019t find it.", "\"I'm not defending\" then proceeds to defend OP. Facepalm.", "He drove drunk and could easily have killed or hurt someone on the way over. I would never trust my kid in a car with him again and would have told him on the phone, if he drove drunk I would be calling the police, and he would not be coming into my home - and followed though.", "As a man, I wouldn't expect any woman, let alone a mother with a young-ish child, put up with me showing up drunk at the door at 4am.  I wouldn't expect to be let in.  Of course, I don't drink and show up at old GF's houses in the middle of the night.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he's dangerous.  He shouldn't be doing that shit.  Don't let him in.  If he escalates with banging or yelling or non-stop calling, that's when I'd call the police.  Plus, even if you did believe that the police might endanger him, why should that bother you?  Why are you tolerating this behavior?  It should be on him to consider the consequences.\n\nIf she felt sorry, throw a sleeping bag outside with a cushion.  Don't invite this clown into her bed.", "If she did not crawl in it with him? Uh yeah?", "Yeah, it\u2019s definitely not intimate in that sense. But I can see how the now ex bf would get that idea.", "If the OP had argued with the ex, and the kid had woken up (sounds highly likely), that could have been highly traumatizing for the kid, who (correctly) was her first priority. So no, that wasn't a problem-free solution.", "Calling the cops may sound like a simple solution but it's a really big step that has the potential for a huge fallout. Will it affect his employment? If he loses his job will I still get child support? Will my kid blame me for the ramifications? It's a lot to consider when you only have seconds to make a decision. \n\nThere isn't a version of this where OP wasn't taking a big risk. Personally, I'd view losing the insecure bf as the better outcome of a long list of potential shitty outcomes.", "No. Refusing entry and having the kid wake up could be really upsetting for the kid. As would calling the cops and having him removed. There was no way for OP to do right by everyone. Getting him in and safe was the better option out of a lot of shitty options.", "At the background \" there were other boundary issues with my ex...\"", "It seems implied in the background, or at least other shady stuff has happened because of OP\u2019s poor boundaries.", "Maybe read my comment again, I said I wasn't defending the ex husband. I didn't mention not defending OP. The facepalm is yours.", "and how is letting a drunk man IN your home a better solution? \n\nI mean, yeah looking back now, considering he fell asleep soon, it worked out. but how could OP know in advance that he would not cause drama inside of her home?!", "That's the thing everyone saying she had to let him in to avoid drama is not thinking about the potential for drama escalating inside the house!"]}
