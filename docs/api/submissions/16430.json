We have a son (9). I started seeing my bf (36m) early this year. \n\nSitch: recently my ex was very intoxicated and called me at about 4:30am. This is the time he typically went to work so I thought maybe something was wrong with his car etc. He was very intoxicated and in a bad place mentally, so I lent my ear. \n\nHe ended up deciding he wanted to see me and it was a great idea to drive the 3 min drive to my house. Despite my absolute refusal and pleads, he drove drunk to my house. Knowing my ex, I let him in quietly, he crawled into my bed and he passed out within 10 min after some blubbering. I did not lay with him. I sat on the couch. \n\nMy son was sleeping. I live in a very small 2bdrm suite. We both had school and work in the morning. I was furious about the whole situation but was trying to do the best for my kid above everything ie. Not have them see a drunken scene with their dad. I left for work and he eventually woke up and left. \n\nI told my bf as soon as I saw him after work that day. He was very upset that I let him in the house and this ultimately led to us (me and new bf) breaking up. He thinks I should have called him a cab (which I honestly didn\u2019t think about and yes, would have been a good option although my ex likely would have refused) or just refused him entry. He thinks I disrespected him and I\u2019m the asshole. \n\nBackground:\nMy ex and I really wanted to remain supportive of eachother and have a friendship, and my bf knew and was accepting of that initially. \nThere were other boundary issues with my ex since the breakup that I was always upfront and honest with my bf about that contributed to this being a big deal. \n\nI just need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. AITA?\n\n** EDIT FOR INFO**\nI did contact my ex the next day and told him it was absolutely not okay to put myself, our child in that position. \nBy boundary issues, I meant my ex crossed lines, I set and enforced boundaries based on my feelings and that of the new (ex) bf. Ie. He slapped my ass, and would joke about us hooking up. I explicitly told him these kind of comments and actions were not okay and stopped putting myself in situations where I was around him alone. This type of situation had never occurred before. My ex is not an angry/hostile/abusive person. Just a sad dude who isn\u2019t over me.

But I think he crossed a line here and if you want to have new relationships you should figure out that line. If your ex didn't want a scene in front of the kid, he shouldn't have come over drunk trying to come in. If I were your new BF I would have done the same because I know this wouldn't be the last time and it would be un needed drama and trust issues. It's not easy to think clearly or make quick decisions at that time of day, but honestly I would have not let him in.", "YTA Your boyfriend is right. You should have refused entry (and call him a cab). This is not a situation you should expose your kid too. I also understand your boyfriend being disgruntled over you offering your home and your BED.

You can say your new bf isn\u2019t/ wasn\u2019t, but when you establish boundaries with new bf\u2019s blessing, then let ex push beyond them, that\u2019s exactly what new bf is going to feel like.\n\nI get wanting to remain friendly with ex, especially with a child involved, but you\u2019re going to need to learn how to tell him no, and actually mean no, before getting in another relationship.", "YTA will you accept the situation if you were at your ex boyfriend place ? Nopeb I doubt it. \n\nCo parenting is a thing, but letting your ex husband sleep in your bed.... what did you expect otherwise than a breakup ???", "I'm going with YTA because it sounds like from what you've said, the break up wasn't over this specific issue it's just that this specific issue was the final straw.  \n\nYou and your husband only split up last year and it's clear that neither of you has truly taken the time and space you need to get over it and be whole people without having drama with each other.  An amicable split doesn't mean you are your ex husbands shoulder to drunkenly cry on,  and it does not mean you allow him to invade your house and bed whenever he feels like it.  \n\nYou ex boyfriend clearly saw that you are still too wrapped up in drama with your ex husband to be in a new relationship and took the only sensible measures for him to live his best life.  \n\nYou're not an asshole in the general sense of the word. It can be hard to realise exactly how dramatic and enmeshed things are when you're in the midst of it and still feel responsibility for actions and emotions of someone you were with for a decade.  But they aren't your responsibility any more and you need to put yourself and your son first before you enter another relationship.  That's why YTA in this situation- to yourself,  your son and your ex boyfriend. \n\nYour ex husband is the biggest asshole by the way,  but that wasn't the question.\n\nEdit: I think one question all the NTAs are neglecting to ask is -why did OP feel the need to answer the phone to her ex at 4.30am in the first place? Car trouble? Why is that her problem? Drunk and sad? Why is that her problem to lend an ear to? There are so many boundaries that should have been in place before the drunken ex husband got in his car.", "YTA. Why would you let him crawl into the bed you share with another guy?

Why the hell would you let a drunk into your home--with a young child--at 4am, instead of, say, calling the police?", "Reminder to you, OP: being supportive of your ex does NOT mean you have to accomodate for his needs or coddle his emotions. \n\nDo NOT allow him to play you like a sad violin.

That'd have been nice for your kid to wake up to and a great image of a dad that might be hard to correct. Yes, that's on your ex's shoulders, sure, but that's the problem with divorces: you no longer have a say in how the other behaves and you just have to deal as best you can with how they behave, even in a situation like this.\n\nI do agree with one commentator that you need to have a conversation with your ex that he never ever drives drunk again, because next time you will call the cops on him, and if you find out he drives drunk or even intoxicated with the kid you'll make sure he'll lose custody.\n\nAs for your now-ex-bf, what a loser for being \"disrespected\" by your ex sleeping off his drunken ass in a bed that you were not in. Ridiculous. Such a fragile ego. That he has zero respect for the situation your drunken ex put you in, that's beyond him? Pfff, good riddance!", "NTA.

I get it.\n\nYou tried to do the right thing and in the moment didn't think about calling a cab, which is just human and an honest mistake/oversight because you had a lot going on right then. The cab companies (all 2 of them in my city lol) don't even have late/overnight hours so it might not have been an actual option anyway. You did the best you could to make sure your child's father was safe (not out driving drunk!)\n\nI'm sorry your relationship ended over this.

You were honest with your boyfriend and nothing you did indicated that you were unfaithful to him.\nYou have a child with your ex, so you can't cut him out of your life even if you wanted to. This may lead to situations where you compromise, do something you wouldn't want to do, in order to maintain amicable relationship with your ex for the benefit of you child.

I understand not wanting to make a drunk 34yo aggressive because you have a child in the house. I\u2019d let the dude sleep and then rip him a new one and use this unacceptable behaviour to set stricter boundaries. Guilt trip him into something if I must. \n\nWould it be better if he showed up and started ringing the bell, screaming and banging the door? It would wake the kid at best or scare the hell out of him. Keep the kid out of it then sort things out as adults at a different time. Having a grown angry bf\u2019s backup on this would be beneficial.

I think you did a good job in difficult circumstances of keeping everyone safe and not affecting your kid's day at school or more long-term mental health. Not being struck by every possible solution when woken up at 4:30am is not AH behaviour, that's just being a human. My feeling is your kid's dad put you in bad situation, and your more recent boyfriend has decided he's going to see it as something it wasn't and get angry about the situation he's imagined. I could see that it's possible (wrt your recent bf) that he wasn't feeling like he could cope with a relationship with you right now in the context of your current boundary issues with your ex, and that's a legitimate decision he can make, but saying you disrespected him in this situation simply isn't true, and makes something rough that you are going through about him a bit more than I am comfortable with.\n\nAbout the boundary issues that you mention, and other people seem to feel are central, I still don't think you're the AH here. Someone can be (and almost always is) an AH by breaking boundaries themselves, but I don't personally think you can call anyone an AH for not having worked out yet how to maintain a boundary that someone else is trying to break. It's definitely a skillset you need to learn, but for your own wellbeing. The fact that you are aware of that particularly makes this the case, as is the fact that you are staying actively aware of how your kid is affected by both the boundary-crossing and your response. You're not a bad person for still learning how to handle this. Good luck!", "[deleted]", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to, but it\u2019s right to worry about exs safety on behalf or your kid.

Not that you could have done anything about it. You did right in avoiding a scene in front of your child and staying on the couch.

And how many times did you sit on the couch while he was in bed (drunk or not) over the last 11 years?

They are not made with a drunk person at 4:30am, within your child's earshot.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the BF is a loss in the long run. His solutions weren't solutions to your concerns for your child. They were about his ego more than anything.\n\nDocument every interaction with your ex. Write it down. Note every time he interacts with you and your child, particularly noting when he is intoxicated.\n\nFind a lawyer. (Look for programs to help moms with custody issues if you can't afford one.)

She also mentioned that if she had called him a cab he likely would have refused to go home.\n\nDV isn't just physical violence, psychological and emotional abuse are also forms of domestic violence and if your partner/ex/whoever (whether intoxicated or not) habitually disrespects boundaries; resulting in a pattern where you feel the need to placate rather than challenge in order to \"keep the peace\" or difuse the situation, that is a huge red flag. It's indicated from OP that this isn't a one off kind of situation, so I'm concerned that there is a bit more to this. OP - I'd recommend speaking to someone about your relationship with your ex to gain some clarity and perhaps support/advice about your situation. Ask yourself the question of why you ultimately feel the need to placate your ex's behaviour - are you anxious or worried about what might happen if you don't? If that is the case I would consider seeking some professional support to help you navigate things moving forward.

I know people with addictions get a bad wrap, but we need to keep in mind they are still people. And your ex sounds like a semi-responsible person who has a job and co-parents his son, while occasionally slips. This happened for the first time in a year? I\u2019d be upset about his behaviour but I would let it slip one time, with a condition that it won\u2019t happen again.

Considering this is the only time this happened in a year, this isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nI\u2019d say you ex is TA. He needs to move on and seek help for his alcoholism.

I think I\u2019m sometimes the same way, and girl, we need to be less nice to people sometimes (lol).\n\nAnother thing. I think your new ex bf is also a little bit of TA.

Just the sheer fact of you being honest, telling him what happened and reassuring him it was a one-time thing and you\u2019ll talk with your ex about boundaries should be enough for his to let it go. But instead, he breaks up with you. I get that he\u2019s upset\u2026 but really? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a very good partner.

They have a friendly coparenting job, he got drunk and he messed up, she let him sleep off his drunken ass instead of making a big issue out of it.", "i disagree completely. someone can be enforcing strong boundaries on someone and the other person can just not give a shit. see: people who break PPOs. \n\nthat\u2019s her son\u2019s father. in my head, i wouldn\u2019t want to risk him getting into a severe accident that may leave her son without a father.", "Why? Because he didn\u2019t let her drive home drunk?", "OP should\u2019ve called the police and reported him for drunk driving. \n\nHe could\u2019ve killed someone.", "it's HER bed. just because the ex is sleeping in it (while she is not) has no sexual context. if she had a friend sleep over for the evening, and they slept in her bed, does that somehow constitute cheating? a bed is just a bed. a piece of furniture. sexual interactions can happen anywhere: the sofa, the floor, the car, the back yard, the kitchen counter, the pool, on top of the washing machine etc.", "...no?\n\nI never said she should have let him drive back drunk. She could have done any number of things from calling him an uber to calling the police.\n\nShe should have nipped this in the bud but she didn't.", "Did you mean to reply to me? I wasn't really talking about the breakup, soley about the issue of drink driving.", "one, don't pick up the phone, uk he's only calling cuz he's drunk and alone\ntwo, don't let him in, you have to kick him out again\nthree, don't be his friend, uk u gonna wake up in his bed in the morning (in this case uk he's gonna wake up in ur bed in the morning)\nand if you're under him, you ain't getting over him!\n\n\n\nsong name: new rules", "This is not as clever as you think it is.", "Well, the boyfriend is gone and the ex remains. As they share a child, they\u2019re stuck with each other for the rest of their lives. So she needs to sort her ex pronto before he messes up her life even more.", "No I really don\u2019t because OP was completely honest about it and because that\u2019s her child\u2019s father and her coparent at the end of they day. \n\nArguing whether he should\u2019ve been called a cab or let to sleep on the house is frankly irrelevant and just arguing semantics. \n\nWhat she did does not cross any normal relationship boundaries of someone with a decent coparenting relationship. He\u2019s going through a tough time and chose to make sure he was safe in the best way she knows how. She didn\u2019t do anything remotely sexual, didn\u2019t play into any games being thrown her way, and managed to keep her kid asleep and her ex safe in the meantime. \n\nWas it an ideal situation? Of course not. But it\u2019s the situation OP found themselves in and they handled it appropriately. There are many times in coparenting relationships where your exes emergencies trump the plans you had or the way you thought your night would go. This is a shitty situation but at the end of the day, with doing stuff like this their child will grow up knowing that their parents care for each other and put their child before anything else.", "So your husband or wife would be cool with your ex coming over and sleeping in your bed while they were out of town?", "She didn\u2019t really want him there, but \u201cknowing my ex\u201d decided to let him in. Also said she didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. Why would there be a scene if she just said no and didn\u2019t let him in?", "He drove drunk. Yes she should\u2019ve called the cops. Wtf is wrong with y\u2019all???", "That is her ex husband, meaning he has the same rights to be in her home as a random stranger on the street if she doesn't want him there. If some random on the street showed up you would let them crash right? It isn't about if he's dangerous or if there's a risk it's that he showed up at her home, invaded her personal space, disrespected her home as her safe space that she can control. If you're willing to let someone do that because they are drunk, if you are really ok putting up with that level of disrespect it isn't being a good person it's being used like a doormat.", "What do you disagree about? She didn\u2019t enforce any boundaries. If she tried to and he reacted negatively, that\u2019s on him. \n\nNo one is saying let him drive again. But the choices aren\u2019t let him sleep in your house or have him drive home. \n\nAlso, I think the bigger picture is being missed. If someone gets drunk and drives to your house and gets to sleep in your bed, why are the chances he does that again? \nAs opposed to, gets drunk, drives to your house, you do not let him in and instead get an Uber for him to go home or call the police if he tries to drive or becomes belligerent. That would be the last time he tries that most likely.", "Honestly the age difference bothers me and leads me to believe that maybe boundaries have never been her strong suit in this relationship. They got together when she was 18 and he was 24. She\u2019s never had another adult relationship except for  this one that may have been a grooming situation.", "Like what. She chose the safest less disruptive option.", "Damn, OP is a real rule breaker!", "Just because you are honest about doing something doesn't mean it was the right to do. \n\nAnd this was not an emergency, but just another time her ex overstepped, and she allowed it. \n\nAnd if he had caused a scene, and woken up the kid, who then has to see their father drunk and acting a fool? Well, that is on the EX. Maybe being seen that way by his kid would get him to see acting that way is not ok. \n\nYou can care about someone and still not give in to their bad behavior.", "The ex has no problems driving drunk, calling his ex for pity, and not taking no for an answer. He shouldn't even be near those kids. And her trying to appease this asshole so things don't escalate? Yeah who needs that kind of drama.", "They would blame the ex and understand that I was stuck in a tough situation, we actually discussed this post. Having said that, I think it's reasonable for the boyfriend to break up because he doesn't want to be with someone with that sort of baggage. That doesn't make it OP's fault, or any sort of betrayal by them. It's just a shitty situation. I'd say the only asshole here is the ex-husband.", "So the only scene you can imagine is violent?\n\nI'm sorry you have had such a terrible life that you can't imagine anything else. But causing a scene can also happen by pounding on the door, or yelling \"let me in\", all of which can happen without any violence whatsoever.", "WTF is wrong with you that your ex is not allowed to make mistakes and needs to be called the cops on straight away? How about some empathy for a guy you used to love and care about and with whom you still share a child?\n\nHonestly, people like you sound like 12 year olds full of principles but no idea how complicated adulthood is. This is not a black and white issue.", "... you lot sound like 12 year olds who have no idea how attached you remain to the person you have children with. Attached, I said, not \"in love\", just in case you now are going to make a AHA SO SHE STILL LOVES HIM.", "And new bf is older than her ex too \ud83d\udc40. The ages jumped out to me as well. OP prob needs time to herself to figure out what her boundaries even are before she gets back into dating.", "WTH\u2026 A 6 year age gap is grooming? Ya\u2019ll need to unplug from social media for a few days and touch grass.", "This was not an emergency by your standards, but for all we know ex has a ton of personal issues, or a family loss and is spiralling downwards. If you would let your child\u2019s parent do that while standing by saying \u201cit\u2019s their choice\u201d that\u2019s incredibly sad. Everyone has tough times and everyone does things they regret or that make them look like an idiot. Everyone needs help from the people around them. OP chose to help and that does not and will never make them a bad person who did a bad thing. \n\nJust because it\u2019s not your choice, doesn\u2019t mean it makes someone an AH. And if you dictate your partners life the way that OPs ex boyfriend wanted to, I hope you look inwards on how toxic that is. Many adults have amicable relationships with exes, in fact it should be a lot more normalized that not everyone has to hate each other after they break up. OP was being a friend from their ex in a moment that they clearly needed one.", "She opened the door \u2026 yeah, it\u2019s her fault. The responsible thing to do is call the cops so he is arrested for DUI so he learns or has his license revoked.  She didn\u2019t do the moral thing because she would have felt guilty having her son see his dad arrested.", "Pounding on the door and yelling definitely doesn\u2019t sound non-violent either.", "So you wouldn\u2019t consider drunk driving, yelling and pounding or someone\u2019s door at 4am to be angry/aggressive behavior? \n\nAlso, my terrible life aside(though I do appreciate your support), it is not exactly super far fetched to imagine a situation like the one you and I agree would have happened had she not let him in, to become violent. I would venture a guess that if you spoke to a police officer they would tell you they had been to such calls like a million times.", "Lmao my ex is a psycho and so is OP\u2019s ex. He\u2019s a crazy alcoholic who drives drunk. He should be in jail. If I were OP I\u2019d have never answered the phone and called the cops when he showed up. Coparenting isn\u2019t enabling your ex\u2019s alcoholism.", "Yes I do, my mom raised my sister and I co-parenting. Our dad was an alcoholic, he showed up drunk multiple times trying to stay at my moms house, she said no, if he didn't leave she called the cops. It's called boundaries, just because someone busted in you doesn't mean they have rights to your home when you aren't together.\n\nEdit; when he was picking us up, dropping us off or there for a reason there wasn't a problem but he wasn't allowed to take over her home like it's his whenever he wanted to get drunk and come over.", "right? \n\nand if there was an incident inside the home, how would that be any less traumatic for the kid? \n\nthe ex 'who wouldn't take no for an answer' does not sound as someone who's safe to be let in intoxicated...", "29 and 36 is just fine.", "Of course it did. Reddit is so fucking obsessed with age gaps. Super weird focus point on everything", "A 6 year age gap is nothing when you're in your 30s. It's an issue  when the age gap is prevalent before you're in your 20s and early 20s. A 24 year old is in an extremely different life point than an 18yo and a 26 year old is vastly more experienced in life than a 20 yo mom. I'm not concerned about the current age gap.  It's not great but she's got more experience under her belt now. The issue is that she's so used to the power dynamic her ex left her with an unbalanced sense of boundaries. Shes got to stand her ground. Her no's arent poweful enough  to deter her Ex from entering her home against her permission and laying about in her bed in a drunken stupor. Ex is still making decisions for her whether she realizes it herself or not.", "It's not the 6 years, it was THOSE six years.  He would have been theoretically out of college for two years while she was still a senior in high school.", "Nope, when a man in his mid 20's is pursuing a literal teenager it's not okay. My niece is 17 and I would not be okay if she brought home a 25 year old boyfriend.", "It absolutely is when the younger party is a teenager.", "When one of them is 18, yes. Think about it in percentages of life. There\u2019s a 25% gap here. The younger the couple is, the wider the age gap is. That\u2019s why age gaps are cool in your 30s and forward, not so cool when one party is 17-21. \n\nYou also need to consider he had been an adult for 6 years while she had been an adult for a few days, weeks, or months. That\u2019s where it\u2019s grooming.", "Right!? This is a Jerry springer episode playing out in real time. I don\u2019t blame the boyfriend for bailing.", "You don't know any of that. What the OP says is far from the ex being a psycho. Stop putting your own story on hers. You're making it more than it is. Nowhere did she say he was an alcoholic. Non alcoholics can get drunk too, you know \\^\\^", "Right? A 5 year or 7 year age difference matters?", "Even when it fits well within their 1/2 age +7 years", "Ya I don't get that... My wife is 8 years younger than me I'm just about to be 37. Such an odd thing that gets fixated on with so many of these posts when it isn't even a factor in many cases.", "This guy doesnt scream college material to me but i could be wrong.", "Exactly. What in the world? Hello, its not the age pap per se Reddit but it\u2019s the ages, 23 and 18yrs old is a big big difference, it\u2019s actually only 5 yrs when you do the math, its the ages. And no one who noticed the ages gap mentioned grooming, and please don\u2019t say it was implied, it was only mentioned as why OP let him violate OP\u2019s boundaries in the past. OP is NTA and I think OP\u2019s ex is a jerk. Its not just any old ex- this is the father of her child.", "It is purported that the human brain fully develops at 25. \n\nYou're reaching for the grooming here my guy.", "HE DROVE DRUNK. ITS VERY ILLEGAL.", "Age gap on its own is typically not an issue. But it is all about the timing. My wife and I are also 8 years apart. Would I have dated her when she was 18? Absolutely no.  We would have been in much different places in our lives. other than the fact that I couldn\u2019t even go to a bar to meet my friends with her.", "24 and 18 is weird and anyone who disagrees is also weird", "Doesn't make him a psycho though", "That's fair. I would not have dated my wife when she was 18 but when we began dating she was 23 so to some people I'd look like some kind of bad guy. Thing is we only ever progressed things in our relationship on her terms.", ">other than the fact that I couldn\u2019t even go to a bar to meet my friends with her.\n\nNot everywhere. In my province you definitely could.", "Sure it can be weird. But it's not grooming.", "Yes it does. Drunk drivers are disgusting psychos who think they can do whatever they want."]}
