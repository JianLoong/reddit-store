I always tried to be like her, dressed like her, listen to her music, you get the idea. I was popular the 1st time I stepped through the HS door because I was basically a copy of her. I was overwhelmed by the attention but quickly found out she was mostly popular with only the guys. She \u201cdated\u201d many of the guys in our HS and they thought I would too. I was so embarrassed, I had our mom take me out to buy new clothes and everything. Whatever she did, I went the opposite way. She wore tons of makeup, I wore none. She listened to a certain type of music, I didn\u2019t. We went to different colleges.\n\nFast forward to now. Sis must have figured out her lifestyle wasn\u2019t healthy so she stopped \u201cdating\u201d a bunch of men, deleted all of those apps, and met Sam. He\u2019s very good looking with a great personality and amazing job. He was smart, funny, outgoing, and can own the entire room when he walks in. He grew up in a different city so his family doesn\u2019t live here but we\u2019ve met and they\u2019re amazing just like him. Sam quickly replaced us as mom\u2019s favorite child and became our dad\u2019s best friend. He eventually proposed and everyone was over the moon. I was very happy for sis.\n\nLast week she came to my door looking like a complete wreck. She was crying so hard she couldn\u2019t talk. After an hour or so, I calmed her down enough to get the story. Apparently they were at a party and was mingling separately when he over heard some guys talking about her popularity. Sam joined the group and got her \u201cdating\u201d history. 2 of the guys in that group \u201cdated\u201d her and about 4 other guys at that party did too, 1 of whom works with him (which is why they were there). He heard about the guys laughing about how all the men in the town were depressed when she went away to college but rejoiced when she came back. When they got home, he asked her, she told him the truth, and he left without saying a word.\n\nI helped sis and she\u2019s been staying with me for now. She hasn\u2019t told anyone and have been trying to get in touch with Sam and his family but they\u2019re all ignoring her. Everyone on our side is super confused because Sam just disappeared. Our cousin (my best friend) pinned me down the other day to ask what happened. I told her and she was appalled. She called him all sorts of names and insecure. I said I can understand from his view as we live in a small town and it\u2019s hard to know many men and your coworkers \u201cknow\u201d your future wife. Then my cousin and I got into it. She said I should be supporting my sis no matter what. I argued I am supporting her but supporting doesn\u2019t mean I have to agree with her.\n\nNow I might lose my best friend.\n\nEdit: we\u2019re all in our 30s, graduated college, and living on our own.", "created_utc": 1668631176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx5idv/aita_for_agreeing_with_her_ex_and_not_my_sister/", "score": 412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound pretty smug and judgmental.\n\nThat was her past.  Sister isn't like that now.  She met a great guy, who is apparently judging her past.

I agree with your friend, you should be supporting your sister.", "YTA so they\u2018re slut shaming her and being misogynistic, great", "YTA...you support a sister in pain. Unless her and Sam had a pact to both remain virgins until marriage,  she did nothing wrong. Curious about Sam's \"dating\" history. Stop judging and just be a truly good sister.", "YTA. This is classic it is okay for guys to do, but not for girls. She had consensual sex if I am reading that correctly. No need to shame her for it.", "This is extremely \u201cpick me\u201d behaviour YTA", "YTA. This is incredibly sexist. If she had been a guy, it would have been fine. As a woman, i always ask myself that question in any situation. Would it be the same if this was a man doing it. would she have left him if he slept around in HS? And her friends were all talking about it. Or is this a situation created by her exes trying to act alpha around her new man. Crowding around talking about what? How they peed on her tree first? Gross frat guy behavior. And doesn\u2019t seem like u like ur sister that much. U have a terrible opinion of her. Maybe she deserves it but not from anything u shared with us. How old are you? This seems very very immature.", "**YTA**\n\nAnd not a gentle one. You're literally suggesting that your sister should be be punished, apparently for the rest of her life (I mean, it's already been nearly 15 years, she's in her THIRTIES), for making poor choices AS A TEENAGER. You know, at that time of her life when we're all insecure, desperately trying to fit in and be liked? You admit yourself that when you started high school you were so confused about how to do so that you styled yourself entirely after her like a little clone because you thought that was the best way to go about being liked. Virtually NO ONE makes good choices in adolescence. It's why we have those years . . . to grow and learn. Adolescent brains are literally incapable of fully comprehending the long term consequences of their actions and behaviour (incomplete frontal cortexes). \n\nAnd you think that well over a decade later, it's reasonable that your sister should not only be PUNISHED for things she did as a de facto CHILD . . . but that you \"understand\" why a grown man who supposedly loved her and was looking to make a life with her would judge her in that way? And you think SHE'S the one who deserves to be looked at sidelong for this, and not him? Do you also use phrases like \"used goods\" to refer to women who have had multiple sexual partners before marriage? Would you react the same way if it was one of the men she'd slept with all those years ago whose partner left him because he'd \"made poor choices in high school and 'dated' too many women\"? \n\nYTA, and shockingly hateful, sexist, and judgemental towards a sister who has never done anything to hurt you.", "YTA\n\nI think that it is okay to have a preference. Frankly, I think your sister and her ex should have had this conversation   before getting engaged. It sounds like he was completely blindsided.\n\nHowever, you should have your sister's back. It sounds like you were ashamed of her lifestyle.", "YTA, for judging your sister for daring to live her life the way she wanted to. Sure he doesn\u2019t have to stay with someone whose history bothers him, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from being a sorry person for having that opinion in the 1st place, as I highly doubt he was a virgin when they met.", "YTA\n\nFrom a male point of view: \nNeither of all those guys had the quality to keep her. Everyone of them happily took advantage of her but now acts like she's to be outcast/blamed. What a bunch of worms.\n\nSam had lots of good qualities but because he found out she had a life before him, what a surprise? He leaves without a word?\n\nDo defend him and put all the blame for him just leaving without a word, YTA.", "YTA.  It sounds like Sam is judging your sister on her past.  On things she did before they even met.  He has no right to do that.  All that matters is how she has acted during their relationship.   Did your sister ever cheat on him?  If not, then he's an asshole for dumping her and not even having the decency to talk to her, but to just ghost her is a double asshole move.  And anyone that would agree with him is also an asshole.", "you seem really judge-y through this whole post. Do you really think Sam handled this break up appropriately? \n\nAlso I don\u2019t understand the last line. What you don\u2019t agree with your sister about?

Everyone has a past, even your sister's bf. They may get back together. Instead of being YTA, be a strong, supportive sister even if you don't \"agree\".", "YTA\n\nAre you seriously saying you think your sister is some how less worthy because she has had multiple sexual partners, and you agree that her fiance should dump her for it?", "How old is everyone involved? I feel safer responding if i know that information.", "YTA, he's not gonna pick you. And you should lose her for your misogyny.", "YTA\n\nUnpopular opinion, but not for siding with Sam. Sam is entitled to feel how he feels about the sexual history of his future wife. Some people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a partner with an extensive sexual history. And you are right, many people are not comfortable working or associating with people their partner had sex with in the past, which is hard to avoid in a small town. In any case, your sister is entitled to sleep with who she wants and her fiance is entitled to feel however he wants about it. He's not entitled to shame her or tell her what to do, but she's not entitled to tell him how to feel.\n\nHowever, you're an asshole because of the unnecessary information about how you decided to not be like your sister and are disgusted by her former lifestyle. I see no reason to go that much in depth about yourself, which tells me you're quite proud of it.  Which tells me you are most likely very judgemental of your sister. Which makes you an asshole.", "YTA this entire post made me sad for you", "YTA\n\nPeople are allowed to enjoy sex. Yes even us women!", "YTA\n\nYou can see it as a problem for her ex but you sound **judgmental throughout your entire post**. \n\nI live in small small town.

I'm from a very religious country too. But her now husband doesn't have a problem with it. No one has (of course she heard stuff when we were in school) since we are all grown people.\n\nHe has the right to be upset. Doesn't make it less upsetting and doesn't make it okay for you to judge her", "YTA.\n\nAre their dangers to \"dating\" around? Absolutely. But the amount of people a person has \"dated\" doesn't dictate their worth in any way, shape, or form. Your cousin is right. If a number or a couple comments about your sister's life from BEFORE they even knew each other was enough to scare away this guy, then he is insecure. Someone who was sure of himself would have stood up for his partner and shut the jerk down.\n\nYour sister deserves better.", "YTA, I can see her ex being uncomfortable at being at a party where her former flings are. But neither of you have a right to judge her for what she did as a single woman.", "Yta, you started with how (you) judged her and transformed  your life to be the opposite of hers because how you hated her history,  she lived her life how she wanted to. Point blank you made her to be the bad person first. \nThen some guys talked about her and her significant other  for his reasons.  decided he didn't want to be associated with her. His loss!!! \nShe has transformed  her life. She feels ostracized and alone, needs her sister whom she turned to out of trust. She trusted you to have her back. \nYou have had it out for her for a very long time you cannot forget nor forgive. So you heap more pain upon your sister and have desolved any trust she had in you. You essentially destroyed your relationship.", "YTA. You have some pretty misogynistic views on dating and sex and you should examine why", "YTA this is sl*t shaming at its ugliest.\n\nYour sister was a young teenager when this pattern of \u201cdating\u201d began.

And punish her for them on top of it?\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t matter how many people she\u2019s \u201cdated\u201d, so long as it was consensual, age appropriate, and safe. I\u2019d say I\u2019m shocked you aren\u2019t defending your sister in this, but it sounds like you contributed just as much to the pattern of shaming her for activities TWO adults shared.\n\nSam sounds immature and insecure. And you should be a better sibling to your now fully grown, deeply hurt sister whose world was just shattered by guy who couldn\u2019t be bothered to even discuss the end of their relationship with her. \n\nSo disappointing.", "YTA your sisters past sex life is none of your or her judgemental boyfriend's business.

I hope she has someone who actually values her to support her through this.", "NTA Except for telling your cousin your sisters business. You're still supporting her, like you said, and that's what really matters.\n\nThat said, I see a lot people on here talking about the situation like it's about women being shamed for enjoying sex or having multiple partners. While it's obviously more accepted by society for men to sleep around, and that's fucked up and a shitty double standard, I don't think it's a misogynistic thing necessarily in this specific case. It certainly could be, and Sam might be part of spreading that double standard, but I think most women would have a pretty big problem with it too if they were at a party and found out their boyfriend had had sex with 6 of the women there. \n\nAttributing that discomfort to her being a women may be correct, but isn't necessarily the case. Men and women can both be uncomfortable with having a partner that has slept with lots of people, especially in a small town, and it doesn't have to have anything to do with sexism. It might, but people on here are acting like it's obviously sexist and there's no other possibility. If those people are reading this, would you be totally okay with it if you found out your SO slept with 6 people at the party you were attending? If so, thats great for you, but I think most people would be at least a little uncomfortable. \n\nBy the way, im not defending him for leaving without a word and ghosting her.

Just because he reacted different doesn\u2019t mean he is an asshole. And what example you are giving spilling milk is so much different. Like I said your reaction might be different in this situation but can\u2019t we just respect him and his decision even if we don\u2019t agree. He might not be the one for her who knows in the future she will meet a better guy. You never know. He just feels humiliated and doesn\u2019t know how to react or how to process it. We all are humans so we should accept each other perceptions even if we don\u2019t agree on the same thing.", "Op didn't say anything about the guys either way, so that's entirely your projection.", "typical misogyny, lady! /s\n\ncompletely agree.", "But you\u2019re a secure person without puritanical hang ups.", ">I feel like if a low body count is important to you you should ask your partner about it?\n\nMaybe he did and she misrepresented herself. It's not uncommon. Which might be the case here, judging by his reaction.", "100% this.  My body count is higher than my husbands, but that sort of came out in casual conversations after we were dating.  It was and is a non-issue.", "My wide and I talked about it before we were married.  \nShe has way more partners than I, and it didn't bother me.  \n\nHOWEVER, if she had lied and told me that she had 1 or 2 and I found out later that she had 10+ that would piss me off.", "I encourage you to read up on emotional intelligence and emotional maturity. Not all reactions are equal, we are able to train our emotional responses, and we can grow as human beings. \n\nWhy is he humiliated? Why is he upset? Why is he ashamed? There is one reason: he is disgusted by his partner having multiple partners? Why? Why does he feel this disgust? If he was so disgusted by it, why wasn\u2019t he angry at these men who clearly also had multiple sexual experiences? Dig deep, deep down.", "That\u2019s the point though. She villainized her sister since high school. But doesn\u2019t care about the guys talking about her sister. That\u2019s a problem.", "This is true! At least the no puritanical hang ups! Secure is debatable lol, but always working on it.\n\nBut yeah, if it\u2019s important to you that your partner have a low body count then you need to discuss it early.", "You probably shouldn\u2019t assume stuff that\u2019s not in the post like that. And I was more responding to the idea that if you slept with a certain number of people you should inform your partners of it."]}
