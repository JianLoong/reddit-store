I was overwhelmed by the attention but quickly found out she was mostly popular with only the guys. She \u201cdated\u201d many of the guys in our HS and they thought I would too. I was so embarrassed, I had our mom take me out to buy new clothes and everything. Whatever she did, I went the opposite way. She wore tons of makeup, I wore none. She listened to a certain type of music, I didn\u2019t. We went to different colleges.\n\nFast forward to now. Sis must have figured out her lifestyle wasn\u2019t healthy so she stopped \u201cdating\u201d a bunch of men, deleted all of those apps, and met Sam. He\u2019s very good looking with a great personality and amazing job. He was smart, funny, outgoing, and can own the entire room when he walks in. He grew up in a different city so his family doesn\u2019t live here but we\u2019ve met and they\u2019re amazing just like him. Sam quickly replaced us as mom\u2019s favorite child and became our dad\u2019s best friend. He eventually proposed and everyone was over the moon. I was very happy for sis.\n\nLast week she came to my door looking like a complete wreck. She was crying so hard she couldn\u2019t talk. After an hour or so, I calmed her down enough to get the story. Apparently they were at a party and was mingling separately when he over heard some guys talking about her popularity. Sam joined the group and got her \u201cdating\u201d history. 2 of the guys in that group \u201cdated\u201d her and about 4 other guys at that party did too, 1 of whom works with him (which is why they were there). He heard about the guys laughing about how all the men in the town were depressed when she went away to college but rejoiced when she came back. When they got home, he asked her, she told him the truth, and he left without saying a word.\n\nI helped sis and she\u2019s been staying with me for now. She hasn\u2019t told anyone and have been trying to get in touch with Sam and his family but they\u2019re all ignoring her. Everyone on our side is super confused because Sam just disappeared. Our cousin (my best friend) pinned me down the other day to ask what happened. I told her and she was appalled. She called him all sorts of names and insecure. I said I can understand from his view as we live in a small town and it\u2019s hard to know many men and your coworkers \u201cknow\u201d your future wife. Then my cousin and I got into it. She said I should be supporting my sis no matter what. I argued I am supporting her but supporting doesn\u2019t mean I have to agree with her.\n\nNow I might lose my best friend.\n\nEdit: we\u2019re all in our 30s, graduated college, and living on our own.", "created_utc": 1668631176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx5idv/aita_for_agreeing_with_her_ex_and_not_my_sister/", "score": 6757, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No need to shame her for it.", "This is extremely \u201cpick me\u201d behaviour YTA", "YTA. This is incredibly sexist. If she had been a guy, it would have been fine. As a woman, i always ask myself that question in any situation. Would it be the same if this was a man doing it. would she have left him if he slept around in HS?

Gross frat guy behavior. And doesn\u2019t seem like u like ur sister that much. U have a terrible opinion of her. Maybe she deserves it but not from anything u shared with us. How old are you? This seems very very immature.", "**YTA**\n\nAnd not a gentle one. You're literally suggesting that your sister should be be punished, apparently for the rest of her life (I mean, it's already been nearly 15 years, she's in her THIRTIES), for making poor choices AS A TEENAGER. You know, at that time of her life when we're all insecure, desperately trying to fit in and be liked? You admit yourself that when you started high school you were so confused about how to do so that you styled yourself entirely after her like a little clone because you thought that was the best way to go about being liked. Virtually NO ONE makes good choices in adolescence. It's why we have those years . . . to grow and learn. Adolescent brains are literally incapable of fully comprehending the long term consequences of their actions and behaviour (incomplete frontal cortexes). \n\nAnd you think that well over a decade later, it's reasonable that your sister should not only be PUNISHED for things she did as a de facto CHILD . . . but that you \"understand\" why a grown man who supposedly loved her and was looking to make a life with her would judge her in that way? And you think SHE'S the one who deserves to be looked at sidelong for this, and not him? Do you also use phrases like \"used goods\" to refer to women who have had multiple sexual partners before marriage? Would you react the same way if it was one of the men she'd slept with all those years ago whose partner left him because he'd \"made poor choices in high school and 'dated' too many women\"? \n\nYTA, and shockingly hateful, sexist, and judgemental towards a sister who has never done anything to hurt you.", "YTA\n\nI think that it is okay to have a preference.

He leaves without a word?\n\nDo defend him and put all the blame for him just leaving without a word, YTA.", "YTA.  It sounds like Sam is judging your sister on her past.  On things she did before they even met.  He has no right to do that.  All that matters is how she has acted during their relationship.   Did your sister ever cheat on him?  If not, then he's an asshole for dumping her and not even having the decency to talk to her, but to just ghost her is a double asshole move.  And anyone that would agree with him is also an asshole.", "you seem really judge-y through this whole post. Do you really think Sam handled this break up appropriately? \n\nAlso I don\u2019t understand the last line. What you don\u2019t agree with your sister about?

Sam is entitled to feel how he feels about the sexual history of his future wife. Some people just aren't comfortable with the idea of a partner with an extensive sexual history. And you are right, many people are not comfortable working or associating with people their partner had sex with in the past, which is hard to avoid in a small town. In any case, your sister is entitled to sleep with who she wants and her fiance is entitled to feel however he wants about it. He's not entitled to shame her or tell her what to do, but she's not entitled to tell him how to feel.\n\nHowever, you're an asshole because of the unnecessary information about how you decided to not be like your sister and are disgusted by her former lifestyle. I see no reason to go that much in depth about yourself, which tells me you're quite proud of it.  Which tells me you are most likely very judgemental of your sister. Which makes you an asshole.", "YTA this entire post made me sad for you", "YTA\n\nPeople are allowed to enjoy sex.

No one has (of course she heard stuff when we were in school) since we are all grown people.\n\nHe has the right to be upset.

But the amount of people a person has \"dated\" doesn't dictate their worth in any way, shape, or form. Your cousin is right. If a number or a couple comments about your sister's life from BEFORE they even knew each other was enough to scare away this guy, then he is insecure.

His loss!!! \nShe has transformed  her life. She feels ostracized and alone, needs her sister whom she turned to out of trust.

You're still supporting her, like you said, and that's what really matters.\n\nThat said, I see a lot people on here talking about the situation like it's about women being shamed for enjoying sex or having multiple partners. While it's obviously more accepted by society for men to sleep around, and that's fucked up and a shitty double standard, I don't think it's a misogynistic thing necessarily in this specific case. It certainly could be, and Sam might be part of spreading that double standard, but I think most women would have a pretty big problem with it too if they were at a party and found out their boyfriend had had sex with 6 of the women there. \n\nAttributing that discomfort to her being a women may be correct, but isn't necessarily the case. Men and women can both be uncomfortable with having a partner that has slept with lots of people, especially in a small town, and it doesn't have to have anything to do with sexism. It might, but people on here are acting like it's obviously sexist and there's no other possibility. If those people are reading this, would you be totally okay with it if you found out your SO slept with 6 people at the party you were attending?

When I was a freshman in college, my group of friends was very friendly with all of the football and rugby guys. We didn't technically have frats at our college, but basically they kind of were. Some of the dudes were definitely kind of douchy, but overall it was a big group of people and it was always a fun time. It was a huge group, we were all friends for the most part, but there were some couples as well and then some people who were always on and off. I did eventually end up hooking up with one friend (single!), actually only third base. It literally wasn't anything, we sort of laughed about it and then never talked about it again. A couple of weeks later, I hooked up with another guy from the group, one that my friend knew I had liked for quite a while. (Single!) But after that one hookup... Man my life completely blew up. This wasn't like a group of five guys where I had done half of the group. It was so crazy, but I got phone calls and horrible messages, people showing up in my room, accusing me of all kinds of other things that I had not done at all. I eventually left the whole entire thing and just made a new friend group. By the end of freshman year I didn't speak to any of those people. Well, except for one. One dude stayed my friend, for years (I don't talk to him much now, but I never even think of him as part of that group. It's like my mind erased it.) He eventually told me that everybody knew that I didn't do it, but a lot of them had been cheating on their girlfriends or whatever and suddenly I became an easy target to blame. And everybody just let it happen. It was horrible, I was 18 and finally living in college and thinking it was time to have some fun and experiment a bit...

It feels like he was totally oblivious and was clued in in a very harsh way, in the middle of a party, with coworkers there too. Ghosting obviously isn't the best choice but it doesn't automatically make him an AH in my opinion. People sometimes get overwhelmed and don't make the best choices when hurt but one mistake doesn't make you an AH. Atleast that's what I think.", "I mean she said it herself she wanted to copy her sister in everything", "While her sister slept around, she was studying the blade /s", "I just want to point at that all these feelings are still based on our social construct around sex as \"dirty\" and that it diminishes your character. The hiding your past, the feeling icky, etc.", "Serious question: why is any of that significant? If, in this hypo, you trust your partner to stick by the relationship boundaries you've agreed on (eg monogamy), why would that information change anything? In the hypo, have you told your partner that you expect an accounting of his sexual past? How detailed does it have to be? Does he have to disclose if he's slept with someone you know? And would you feel the need to disclose it if you've slept with someone he knows?", "Well, i witnessed a discussion on this topic a while ago and most people said that while they won't judge anyone for having multiple sex partners (high body count, if you prefer this term) they wouldn't pick such a person to be their SO. Both men and women said the same thing: do what you want but respect my choice for not dating you when you decide to settle down.\n\nNow on this instance OP and the ex are not wrong about their values but the ex acted and OP expressed it badly. OP's sister should not be judged for her sex life but considering that she lives in a small town and \"dated\" most guys there she should be open with her prospective partners about her past, not let them discover the way her ex did. She's not a slut and the guys that don't want to date her because of that high number of partners should not be bullied for refusing a relationship (as long as they are respectful).", "I like the way you think", "Or guys who claim to have slept with her.", "The almost half a dozen guys she \"slept with\" are AH for bringing up her past with the current man.  How immature!", "> if someone asks it\u2019s a red flag for me and the date/relationship is over.\n\nIs that because you are ashamed of your number?", "This girl gotta have beer flavoured nipples or something for them to be remembering her all these years later!", "I grew up in a small town and still live here. I spent several years sleeping around casually - slept with all of two guys from this county, and regretted it twice. The one guy it was just awkward that my parents may hear him bragging about it and the other guy, well, I knew better than to report a small town hero for date rape. I go out of town for hookups, and I won't date anyone from my county even now I'm looking for more than sex.\n\nAbsolutely, don't sleep around in small towns. Worth the drive to the city.", "Exactly. What kind of man brags about his conquests?  A shallow one.", "Yes!! All of these men sound awful! I wouldn\u2019t want to live somewhere that small minded that that\u2019s how the men behaved. \n\nThis happened years ago, the sister has been faithful to Sam. Everyone in the situation besides the sister & cousin need to grow up and move on.", "This happened to me too. My first year in high school I started getting a reputation and hadn't even fooled around with anyone that much. I remember a guy walking up to me freshman year in high school, telling me he had a condom and did I want to meet him at the park that night?  He did this in front of the whole class. Here it is almost 50 years later and I still remember the shame so clearly.", "The men should be shamed for still discussing who they slept with in high school when they're in their 30's! Get over it already, it was a lifetime ago!! If I thought someone who'd slept with me that long ago was still talking about it, I'd be embarrassed for them!", "Goddamn I wish this was higher. That edit is on point.", "At that party. So a self-selecting sample of friends of a similar age who haven't left the town. That's no way to infer how many people or what proportion of the town Older Sister has slept with. And it's her past. She's allowed to have one, just like everyone else.", "At my 30th reunion, one of the \u201cpopular girls\u201d was drunk and told me that she was miserable in HS, so she used to hide in the boys bathroom- \u201cand there was an entire stall dedicated to you and you EXPLOITS\u201d \nNow, Hearing that did not hurt 48 year old me, but I did feel bad for 17 year old me, and a little bewildered at why this woman felt that I needed that information now. So I just said \u201cOh, I guess I\u2019m I didn\u2019t know that in High School- and for the record- Not.A.Single.ONE. I never slept with anyone from this town, because I didn\u2019t want to get stuck here\u201d\nAnd she just said \u201cYou must have given some great handjobs then\u201d\n\nI recently went to my 40th -and she was so nice, and I just told her I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize that she was so unhappy in HS. \u201cI guess your life looked pretty perfect, but everyone\u2019s got stuff, right?\u201d And she was sober and seemed really glad I\u2019d brought it up. She thanked me. And- every guy still wanted a picture with me, and I looked amazing and felt perfectly comfortable because- we aren\u2019t 17. Sounds like everyone needs to grow up."]}
