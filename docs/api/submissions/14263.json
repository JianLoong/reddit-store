This guy supports you and gives you an allowance and you are pissed because he won't give you a share of the house too?\n\nThat's how this comes across. You sound a little greedy. You need to work on that \n\nAs a woman, if I owned a house free and clear with no mortgage  then got married and the man wanted his name in the house there is no way in hell I would do it.  Why should your fiance?", "I think this is a NAH situation.  \n\nIt's normal and understandable for you to want some security in the relationship.  If you leave your job, the property is all in his name, and then you guys get divorced, you're potentially going to be completely fucked.  And I think it's a very bad power imbalance to have that in a relationship. \n\nThat said, he's coming at this from this is his house and he's already worried about girls only dating him for his money. If he puts your name on a house he owns 100% of, he's basically giving you half of a house. And that's a big ask, especially if you aren't even married yet.  \n\nThere are probably ways to address both of your concerns. But I would probably not run headlong into \"husband pays for everything\" when he's not thinking about this in terms of \"we both own everything.\" If the important assets are his separately, it's probably not safe (for you) to stop working for a long period of time.", "YTA, it's his house before you met.  You aren't going to work, and he is providing for you financially.  If you want financial independence, earn your own money.\n\nWhy is what is his suddenly yours?  What are you bringing to the table?  Yes, you will be married, but you did nothing to build his wealth, so how is it unreasonable that he would want to protect pre-existing assets in case of divorce?  If the situations were reversed, you'd feel the same.\n\nHe is very lucky, and he is sharing that with you.  Try to look at it from his perspective and maybe you'd come off as less of a gold digger.", "YTA.   You don't suddenly just get to own a house just because you married the person who owns it.  Also do expect him to get a prenup.  Get your own lawyer to review so that it's fair to both or you as individuals.

Don't try and take his house.", "How about fiction?", "Neither of you are the AH. This is hard. Both of you need to go see a pre-marriage counselor and a family law attorney.

You shouldn't have quit your job before you were married. It's reasonable that you're feeling insecure about him having full financial control over you and want to literally have something to your name in case something goes wrong because if things don't work out in the next few years, you'll have lost a career and not have anything to show for it.\n\nThat said, his house is his. If he puts your name on it, all of a sudden you'd be able to force him to sell in the event of a divorce. Him wanting to wait a while before buying joint property makes perfect sense because it's more of a financial risk for him. Him having an inheritance before you get married means that money stays his regardless.\n\nYou probably need to go back to work tbh. He's not likely to put your name on the house and pushing will end the relationship if he already has fears about being used for money. If you want this to work, you probably need your own money. Working sucks but it brings peace of mind.", "You asked. He answered. Now you all need to have a frank and honest conversation about how your financial situation will be for the rest of your life.\n\nGood luck.", "Certain songs comes to mind..", "You're the greedy Ahole!  \nYTA", "You are literally being handed an easy life of being taken care of by someone else and you\u2019re throwing it away because you got greedy for more? He should be worried you\u2019re taking advantage of him   Yta", "It was his before you why is this an issue? If you need to be on a deed so bad just push to build or buy a new one but let him keep what\u2019s his his YTA", "YTA he is doing a lot for you, because he loves you and cares about you but you also want the house and you're upset when he said no to one thing", "Gentlest possible YTA. \n\nWhy isn't it enough that he fully supports you? He clearly has a lot of feelings tied into his inheritance and protecting himself from being taken advantage of. Different property arrangements can exist in a marriage, it isn't always \"what's yours is mine\" by default. \n\nPlease go to marriage counseling and see a family lawyer, as well as financial planner. It's better to talk about money before you jump into marriage, so as unfortunate as the argument was and as uncomfortable as the conversation will be, better to thresh it out now. It will save you time and money, as well as a lot of emotional pain, later on. \n\nAnd as to your hurt feelings about how you feel like it means he doesn't trust you: they are understandable and valid. But as someone who went into my marriage with significantly more money and property than my partner, protecting your individual assets is about having a safety net. We have a shared account and free use of each other's properties, but what's his is his and what's mine is mine. Going on a decade now and we're great. My parents have a separate-property arrangement, too, and they're going on fifty years of a loving marriage. (Also, I bought my first house at 21 and spent years slaving to pay off the loan while I was in law school, so I don't even consider my partner's input when it comes to that house and he knows to butt out because that place is special to me.)\n\nAnyway, I hope this gives you some perspective and that it works out for the best in the end.", "YNTA, and neither is he.\n\nBut without your own income, you will become totally dependant on him, which is bad.

NTA", "NAH - I think you both need to have a frank discussion about finances with probably a pre-marital agreement that meets in the middle. \n\nFrank has a right to want to protect property that he had before even meeting you and you have the right to want to make sure you are protected in the case that you guys don't work out, especially since you gave up your job. So these are real issues for you guys to discuss and find a solution that doesn't make him feel taken advantage of and doesn't leave you on your own if things don't work out.", "ESH. The house is a premarital asset and you contributed nothing it. It\u2019s wrong for you to insist he put you on the deed. If you want rights over the home you live in,  you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to move into his house. You should have insisted that you buy a house together and by together I mean you both provide the finances. My problem with your fianc\u00e9 is he\u2019s created a dynamic there is an imbalance of power because you are totally dependent on him financially.  Because his money was inherited and the house was purchased before the marriage, you\u2019re not going to be entitled to anything should you two divorce. \n\nEither your fianc\u00e9 knows that and doesn\u2019t care or it hasn\u2019t occurred to him at all even though he should be looking out for you. Either way, he shouldn\u2019t be ok with being the only who that\u2019s secure. If I were you, I would go back to work. If you don\u2019t want to teach anymore, consider a different career path.

I doubt it", "NAH, but there\u2019s a reason so many women wanted their own income and property that they had a movement about it. I\u2019m sure you want to feel secure and not entirely dependent on his whim, even if he is a good man.

You\u2019ve not put forward any financial contribution to purchase the other half of the property from him. You don\u2019t get to just demand you get half because you\u2019re getting married. That home should be a protected asset prior to signing marriage papers", "YTA, when I married my husband the house we lived in was his from before he met me.  I helped pay the bills.  A few years later when we sold his place and bought a different place both our names went on the deed.", "YTA. Why exactly do you think you deserve half of the house? He paid it off himself with nothing from you. Premarital assets are not divided up in the event of a divorce, so even if you were married, you would have no claim to it. \n\nYou said, \"He struggled to date because he was always  worried the girl he was dating was using him.\" I don't want to accuse you of this without more evidence, but no matter how you put it, financially, you're getting a lot out of this relationship. You're able to quit your job and be able to live well and pursue your other interests. That's something many people would kill to have. You have to be honest with yourself cause you are coming across as greedy here. Why are you with him? Because he can provide such a great lifestyle, or would you be with him no matter what his financial status is? If you're not \"using him,\" then why are you offended by what he wants? He said you'll share the ownership of any future houses, so you'll eventually own a house. Why exactly does it have to be this house?", "YTA. The house is his. He can keep it in his name if he wants or add you. IF HE WANTS TO. You have no rights to any of his possessions before you are married(and even during marriage it can get very technical). And the reverse is true for him having no rights to any of your possessions that you owned before you were married.", "YTA. I do not think you should be added to the deed of his current house either. You didn\u2019t contribute to it. It makes me a little uncomfortable that you are fully comfortable being completely supported by him, not contributing anything, and still asking for more. Someone from the outside looking in might think you are actually using him for his money. Also - You really should think about continuing to work after you get married. If you ever get divorced, it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t get much in this situation, as his inheritance likely won\u2019t be counted towards alimony, you are capable of working, and you won\u2019t have any children. You are putting yourself in a really bad position. It\u2019s not smart.", "ESH - He should have a prenup if he really does have all these assets. If you didn't contribute anything, why do you feel entitled to his house? I also think you quitting your job is a really bad idea. It leaves you with less freedom later and no real access to money other than your allowance.", "NAH.  I get that you want to protect yourself because you\u2019ll be at a financial disadvantage, but I think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing and, in the process, making your fianc\u00e9 think you\u2019re exactly what he feared.   Y\u2019all should do a lot of talking, and seek out advice from a financial planner, and maybe lawyers, for a pre-nup\u2014they don\u2019t only protect the \u201cricher\u201d partner.", "NAH\n\nYou guys need a prenup.\n\nHe needs one to protect his assets.

Sounds like he makes good money, however he's doing it it's certainly not by being a good judge of character.", "YTA in my opinion. as another person on here mentioned, you both should talk with divorce attorneys and agree on a prenup. after marriage, individual assets dont automatically become shared assets. hes offering you to quit your job and pay for your hobbies... but you want more. hes willing to have your name on the house that you two buy in the future together. this is fair, in my opinion. If youre worried about not having your own income and wanting a safety net in the form of shared ownership in his house, then perhaps dont quit your job.", "You two are so not ready for marriage. I wish your fiance see it and postpone the wedding.\n\nSounds mean but really for your own benefit - please be financially independent. \n\nYTA and go get a job.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t contribute anything to the house. You don\u2019t pay any bills. In fact, he was generous enough to notice that you weren\u2019t happy at your job and has been supporting you in finding hobbies and things that you enjoy instead of working. Most people aren\u2019t that lucky! You aren\u2019t entitled to assets that your fianc\u00e9 acquired before he even met you. \n\nBe thankful that your fianc\u00e9 is in a financial position that doesn\u2019t require you to work. Stop being greedy.", "Deadly women vibes", "YTA!  He needs to rethink this relationship. He\u2019s going to start thinking of you just like he did his ex simply because you are acting like you\u2019re there for his money. Get a job! You don\u2019t like teaching do something else. He\u2019s giving you an allowance use it to go back to school. Work part time or just set him free so he can find someone that isn\u2019t just in it for the money because it sounds like that\u2019s why you\u2019re in this relationship.", "YTA goooooold diigggerrrrr", "YTA. You're extremely greedy. You don't even have to work anymore because you're living off his money. But now you're demanding ownership of a house that you didn't pay a penny for? He should NOT marry you. He already offered a compromise by giving you joint ownership of your future home. But you're demanding to be put on the deed of a house that it sounds like he got before he even started dating you.", "YTA-and also, don\u2019t quit your job if you don\u2019t have kids. You need to keep working and make your own money, even if he suggested it. Also, if the property is pre-marriage, it\u2019s his (at least in my State). So best for you to keep working and have your own money so you can buy a property together.", "Wait, he was worried about someone using him for his money, but then creates a situation where someone is using him for his money?", "I get the mentality to a degree \n\nIf he decides to have an affair and leave you high and dry, he could force you out with no where to go. \n\nBut on that same token- if you decide to do the same you could take what you had no part in building. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not exactly romantic or fun to think on these situations but they happen too often to not be thought of at all. You two need to have this discussions and perhaps hash out a prenuptial agreement. \n\nMore importantly, you should consider all that he\u2019s done for you this far. He\u2019s been very kind and has provided for you. Most people don\u2019t get the luxury to not have to work and focus on hobbies that make them happy and he\u2019s made it so you can. Isn\u2019t it fair that he keeps an asset that he\u2019s made before even meeting you? \n\nTake some time to think of things from his perspective instead of jumping to feeling offended. Because you haven\u2019t done that at all and it makes YTA", "YTA 100%! Now go apologize and say you will never act this entitled again, because this......is a horrible character trait.", "YTA. Did you invest money? If not, no fucking way. You ARE the asshole.", "YTA. You already have it \u201cmade.\u201d You have zero responsibilities in life. take a seat and let the dude own *his* house alone.", "Unpopular opinion: I was gonna say YTA but having in mind the fact that he offered you to be SAHW and said he is gonna take care of you then he should. However, dear OP, get a job. If anything goes wrong with your marriage you will be left with nothing. I am not sure if you realise what control he has over you now. Find another job, be more independent.", "Yes, exactly what I came here to say. And if I may add, OP, you said you have talked about buying a house together. Why not talk about it with him? Ask him what\u2019s the plan, how can you help save for that, is it viable considering how things are at the moment and everything. Your want to have a name on the deed is understandable, but so is his to not include it. Strive to build something alongside him, talk to him and make a plan, but for god\u2019s sake, TALK TO HIM. You need to be in agreement over finances and assets, otherwise this marriage will not last.", "She quit her job based on his suggestion. So now she is entering into a marriage where she has no income and no control over the assets. It creates a situation that is rife with opportunity for financial abuse and she is right to want to have some sort of guarantee of financial security. \n\nIt's something they need to work out and come to an agreement that protects both of them.", "On the other hand she quit her job and depending on jurisdiction she needs to protect herself to ensure she is taken care of if he decides to leave.  Once he encouraged her to quit her job he is taking responsibility for her future and that needs to be spelled out in a prenup.", "Ummm because they are married? \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours\u201d", "Because he asked her to quit her job and she did. It\u2019s good practice to not be completely finically dependent on your spouse. OP\u2019s being smart, if he doesn\u2019t put her name on the house she should get a job. She\u2019s protecting herself just like he is", "OP needs the pre nup just as much as her fianc\u00e9. She\u2019s no longer working and will be screwed if they get divorced.", "This is good advice. The fact that OP has these concerns indicates that she likely should not be relying fully on her partner to support her. 26 is very young to give up on having your own income.", "What does ESH mean?", "If OP is concerned about her financial independence, then she can get a job.", "If this is a real concern, she can always, you know, keep working.", "She didn't have to quit, and she didn't have to not get another job.", "She's an adult...she didn't have to quit.", "She didn't have to quit. He saw she was unhappy and offered to support her.", "So she should go back to work then", "she doesnt have to quit her job. I think OP mentioned they were in the discussion phase about that. and she didnt commit yet.", "Why leave the job, in the first place", "I missed the part where he said during his suggestion that she would be entitled to his inheritance. Inheritance is very often kept separate, even for married couples. Why are you trying to make it seem like he misled her or something? She has legitimate concerns but that really just means she should find an actual job with all the freedom he is affording her.", "That\u2019s generally not how property works. What you bring to the marriage is not shared. What you acquire together is shared.", "He didn\u2019t ask her to quit. He saw she didn\u2019t like her job and said she could quit if she wanted to. Those are two completely different situations. OP is welcome to keep working. In fact, from what she has said, he covered all of her living expenses and everything she made at work was hers to do with as she pleased. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9 has been extremely generous.", "He didn\u2019t ask her to quit though. He gave her an option. You\u2019re right that she should protect herself by finding a new job.", "Exactly! Prenups truly are for the protection of both parties", "Exactly what she should be doing. Getting a job and acquiring her own investments.", "It was his suggestion, and they made the decision together based on the agreement that he would financially support him. Now she is realizing that she is entering into a marriage where she doesn't own anything, and the agreement they made leaves her vulnerable. \n\nIt's natural for her to have concerns about that. And while asking for half the house may not be the right ask, but she has the right to figure out how her financial future will be protected in this agreement they made.", "Exactly. She is in a very good situation where she can take the time to find a job she likes.", "Imagine marrying someone who\u2019s asking you to live in a house they don\u2019t want to share. Couldn\u2019t be me. \n(And yes I was the property owner when I got married and yes I did share).", "He\u2019s not forcing her to stay home.", "Everything is given to her. Get a job save the money because there are no expenses. OP sounds like a teenager. She quit cause she wanted to.", "She is rightly concerned about being completely financially dependent on her fianc\u00e9 & his goodwill. However, that is always going to be a risky situation. In the case of the house, she thought they agreed to share all his money, & now he has let her know that this is not the case, simply because he doesn\u2019t feel like it. What else will he \u201cnot feel like\u201d sharing in the future? What recourse will she have if he decides to unreasonably limit her allowance? What if he decides to quit giving her money because he decides that whatever activities she chooses aren\u2019t worthy enough? If she doesn\u2019t have a source of income that she controls, she\u2019ll be stuck."]}
