The ground rules include that he would give me allowance every month and that he expected me to not just sit at home all day on my phone because he wants me to find hobbies and passions because we both don't want children.

This made me upset because I thought he was trying to say that I was using him and we are getting married so I thought the house would become \"ours\". He told me that things will become ours but this was the first house he ever bought and that he wanted to keep something for himself. He told me that if we decide to change houses or have one built, which we have discussed before, that he would have both our names put on the deed.

This guy supports you and gives you an allowance and you are pissed because he won't give you a share of the house too?\n\nThat's how this comes across. You sound a little greedy. You need to work on that \n\nAs a woman, if I owned a house free and clear with no mortgage  then got married and the man wanted his name in the house there is no way in hell I would do it.  Why should your fiance?", "I think this is a NAH situation.  \n\nIt's normal and understandable for you to want some security in the relationship.  If you leave your job, the property is all in his name, and then you guys get divorced, you're potentially going to be completely fucked.  And I think it's a very bad power imbalance to have that in a relationship. \n\nThat said, he's coming at this from this is his house and he's already worried about girls only dating him for his money. If he puts your name on a house he owns 100% of, he's basically giving you half of a house. And that's a big ask, especially if you aren't even married yet.  \n\nThere are probably ways to address both of your concerns. But I would probably not run headlong into \"husband pays for everything\" when he's not thinking about this in terms of \"we both own everything.\" If the important assets are his separately, it's probably not safe (for you) to stop working for a long period of time.", "YTA, it's his house before you met.  You aren't going to work, and he is providing for you financially.  If you want financial independence, earn your own money.\n\nWhy is what is his suddenly yours?  What are you bringing to the table?  Yes, you will be married, but you did nothing to build his wealth, so how is it unreasonable that he would want to protect pre-existing assets in case of divorce?  If the situations were reversed, you'd feel the same.\n\nHe is very lucky, and he is sharing that with you.  Try to look at it from his perspective and maybe you'd come off as less of a gold digger.", "YTA.   You don't suddenly just get to own a house just because you married the person who owns it.  Also do expect him to get a prenup.  Get your own lawyer to review so that it's fair to both or you as individuals.

Don't try and take his house.", "How about fiction?", "Neither of you are the AH. This is hard. Both of you need to go see a pre-marriage counselor and a family law attorney.

You shouldn't have quit your job before you were married. It's reasonable that you're feeling insecure about him having full financial control over you and want to literally have something to your name in case something goes wrong because if things don't work out in the next few years, you'll have lost a career and not have anything to show for it.\n\nThat said, his house is his. If he puts your name on it, all of a sudden you'd be able to force him to sell in the event of a divorce. Him wanting to wait a while before buying joint property makes perfect sense because it's more of a financial risk for him. Him having an inheritance before you get married means that money stays his regardless.\n\nYou probably need to go back to work tbh. He's not likely to put your name on the house and pushing will end the relationship if he already has fears about being used for money. If you want this to work, you probably need your own money. Working sucks but it brings peace of mind.", "You asked. He answered. Now you all need to have a frank and honest conversation about how your financial situation will be for the rest of your life.\n\nGood luck.", "Certain songs comes to mind..", "You're the greedy Ahole!  \nYTA", "You are literally being handed an easy life of being taken care of by someone else and you\u2019re throwing it away because you got greedy for more? He should be worried you\u2019re taking advantage of him   Yta", "It was his before you why is this an issue? If you need to be on a deed so bad just push to build or buy a new one but let him keep what\u2019s his his YTA", "YTA he is doing a lot for you, because he loves you and cares about you but you also want the house and you're upset when he said no to one thing", "Gentlest possible YTA. \n\nWhy isn't it enough that he fully supports you? He clearly has a lot of feelings tied into his inheritance and protecting himself from being taken advantage of. Different property arrangements can exist in a marriage, it isn't always \"what's yours is mine\" by default. \n\nPlease go to marriage counseling and see a family lawyer, as well as financial planner. It's better to talk about money before you jump into marriage, so as unfortunate as the argument was and as uncomfortable as the conversation will be, better to thresh it out now. It will save you time and money, as well as a lot of emotional pain, later on. \n\nAnd as to your hurt feelings about how you feel like it means he doesn't trust you: they are understandable and valid. But as someone who went into my marriage with significantly more money and property than my partner, protecting your individual assets is about having a safety net. We have a shared account and free use of each other's properties, but what's his is his and what's mine is mine. Going on a decade now and we're great. My parents have a separate-property arrangement, too, and they're going on fifty years of a loving marriage. (Also, I bought my first house at 21 and spent years slaving to pay off the loan while I was in law school, so I don't even consider my partner's input when it comes to that house and he knows to butt out because that place is special to me.)\n\nAnyway, I hope this gives you some perspective and that it works out for the best in the end.", "YNTA, and neither is he.\n\nBut without your own income, you will become totally dependant on him, which is bad.

ESH", "NAH - I think you both need to have a frank discussion about finances with probably a pre-marital agreement that meets in the middle. \n\nFrank has a right to want to protect property that he had before even meeting you and you have the right to want to make sure you are protected in the case that you guys don't work out, especially since you gave up your job. So these are real issues for you guys to discuss and find a solution that doesn't make him feel taken advantage of and doesn't leave you on your own if things don't work out.", "ESH. The house is a premarital asset and you contributed nothing it. It\u2019s wrong for you to insist he put you on the deed. If you want rights over the home you live in,  you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to move into his house. You should have insisted that you buy a house together and by together I mean you both provide the finances. My problem with your fianc\u00e9 is he\u2019s created a dynamic there is an imbalance of power because you are totally dependent on him financially.  Because his money was inherited and the house was purchased before the marriage, you\u2019re not going to be entitled to anything should you two divorce. \n\nEither your fianc\u00e9 knows that and doesn\u2019t care or it hasn\u2019t occurred to him at all even though he should be looking out for you. Either way, he shouldn\u2019t be ok with being the only who that\u2019s secure. If I were you, I would go back to work. If you don\u2019t want to teach anymore, consider a different career path. You don\u2019t want to spend your life feeling like you\u2019re at your husband\u2019s mercy.", "ESH.\n\nGirl, don\u2019t ever give up your own financial independence. You shouldn\u2019t rely on him to financially support you, do yourself and the relationship a favour if you want it to last. go find another job, earn your own money so when things go wrong, you are able to support yourself.\n\nAlso it\u2019s his house, if you are in his position would you willingly put his name on it too? I doubt it", "NAH, but there\u2019s a reason so many women wanted their own income and property that they had a movement about it. I\u2019m sure you want to feel secure and not entirely dependent on his whim, even if he is a good man.

You\u2019ve not put forward any financial contribution to purchase the other half of the property from him. You don\u2019t get to just demand you get half because you\u2019re getting married. That home should be a protected asset prior to signing marriage papers", "YTA, when I married my husband the house we lived in was his from before he met me.  I helped pay the bills.  A few years later when we sold his place and bought a different place both our names went on the deed.", "YTA. Why exactly do you think you deserve half of the house? He paid it off himself with nothing from you. Premarital assets are not divided up in the event of a divorce, so even if you were married, you would have no claim to it. \n\nYou said, \"He struggled to date because he was always  worried the girl he was dating was using him.\" I don't want to accuse you of this without more evidence, but no matter how you put it, financially, you're getting a lot out of this relationship. You're able to quit your job and be able to live well and pursue your other interests. That's something many people would kill to have. You have to be honest with yourself cause you are coming across as greedy here. Why are you with him? Because he can provide such a great lifestyle, or would you be with him no matter what his financial status is? If you're not \"using him,\" then why are you offended by what he wants? He said you'll share the ownership of any future houses, so you'll eventually own a house. Why exactly does it have to be this house?", "YTA. The house is his. He can keep it in his name if he wants or add you. IF HE WANTS TO. You have no rights to any of his possessions before you are married(and even during marriage it can get very technical). And the reverse is true for him having no rights to any of your possessions that you owned before you were married.", "YTA. I do not think you should be added to the deed of his current house either. You didn\u2019t contribute to it. It makes me a little uncomfortable that you are fully comfortable being completely supported by him, not contributing anything, and still asking for more. Someone from the outside looking in might think you are actually using him for his money. Also - You really should think about continuing to work after you get married. If you ever get divorced, it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t get much in this situation, as his inheritance likely won\u2019t be counted towards alimony, you are capable of working, and you won\u2019t have any children. You are putting yourself in a really bad position. It\u2019s not smart.", "ESH - He should have a prenup if he really does have all these assets. If you didn't contribute anything, why do you feel entitled to his house? I also think you quitting your job is a really bad idea. It leaves you with less freedom later and no real access to money other than your allowance.", "NAH.  I get that you want to protect yourself because you\u2019ll be at a financial disadvantage, but I think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing and, in the process, making your fianc\u00e9 think you\u2019re exactly what he feared.   Y\u2019all should do a lot of talking, and seek out advice from a financial planner, and maybe lawyers, for a pre-nup\u2014they don\u2019t only protect the \u201cricher\u201d partner.", "NAH\n\nYou guys need a prenup.\n\nHe needs one to protect his assets.

If he wants you to be a stay at home wife, then you need some financial security.\n\nIn the old days where women didn\u2019t work, this security came from the house going to them if they got a \u201cfor cause\u201d divorce.

This inequality is also often used as a tool to manipulate... who hasn't heard \"I pay the bills, why aren't you cooking? Why aren't you doing \\_\\_\\_? Why aren't you having sex with me?\" This is why women are increasingly becoming participants in the workforce- a man holding all of the power (money) allowed them to put women into situations that they didn't want to be in.

You have not contributed to the house, so there is no reason to add you to the deed. \n\nThe reason I am putting ESH instead of YTA is because you\u2019re not working and he\u2019s supporting that idiocy. You\u2019re not planning to have kids, go find a job, because otherwise you\u2019ll never be independent from him which is ridiculous. You didn\u2019t like your job, fine, find a different one! It takes most people years to find a job they like or at least not completely hate - at your age I didn\u2019t like my job either. Fast forward 15 years and my job is something I like, that makes me proud, and that has provided me with a number of friends over the years. At least work half days, or something.

Don\u2019t completely give up on working, but use the opportunity your fianc\u00e9 gave you to find yourself and potentially pursue a new career. This will give you some financial independence while you can still make whatever work you have be flexible enough to accommodate your mental health needs; it will also show him that you\u2019re not completely set on financially relying on him for the rest of your life. Even though he is pretty financially secure right now, something like this could change in a second and it\u2019d be beneficial for both of you if you were to maintain a career and steady income. If he happens to lose all his money in 15 years, being in your 40s with nothing to show for in your resume would make things even tougher for both of you.\n\nEdit: About the house: Please try to understand that this is also not just about the money. Didn\u2019t his uncle leave him the house and he finished paying for it? You can never be sure of what could happen in a marriage and the possibility of losing his home, inherited from a beloved relative, could just be very scary for him.

If he dies and has no will, the house would likely go to you. If he has a will, he could gift the house to someone other than you; you likely would not win if you brought a lawsuit to try to get it.

This 90% she spent a lifetime saving and it was her legacy intended for her son. NOT for me to take half and force a sale. Because I have a conscience and know right from wrong, I told him that I don\u2019t want any of the proceeds of the house. Not a cent. And do you know what he did in turn? He told me to continue living in the house for free with the kids and he\u2019ll keep paying the mortgage as child support. All I had to do was pay the bills. And he still pays half for any extras (Christmas gifts, school fees, elite sports, birthdays, trips). My one act of not being greedy set in motion a series of events which ultimately set the tone and made our divorce amicable.

She cannot expect others to set her up in life regardless of their wealth or assets. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing to say (from what I\u2019ve read) that he manipulated, coerced, or forced her to leave her job, nor anything to suggest he\u2019s preventing her from seeking other employment or retraining. \n\nHe\u2019s happy to give her an \u2018allowance\u2019, is actively encouraging her to pursue hobbies and activities, and is willing to jointly purchase/build their future home. \n\nShe\u2019s been given a golden and rare opportunity that most of us don\u2019t get - freedom to pursue whatever goals and passions you want, free from the restrictions of work or money. \n\nYes, it\u2019s worrying that she\u2019s potentially entering a marriage where she owns nothing, but that\u2019s her own choice if she does so. He\u2019s laid out what he\u2019s willing to give her and what he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s up to her to consider the risks and make a sensible decision. Her financial security is ultimately her responsibility, not her partner\u2019s, and if she chooses to continue the relationship with this set up, she\u2019s choosing to be 100% reliant on him. I would personally never choose that, precisely because as I\u2019ve said, it can lead to highly abusive situations from which escape is difficult or impossible, but \u2018can\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018will\u2019. Again, it\u2019s OP\u2019s responsibility to consider the risks based on the facts of the situation and what she\u2019s been told. \n\nBoyfriend is, rightly, ensuring his *own* financial security should the relationship ever go sour. Relationships don\u2019t require you to share *everything*. Assets earned/gifted outside of a relationship remain (at least in UK law) the sole property of the owner, and rightly so. \n\nI own a home and I wouldn\u2019t put *any* partner on my mortgage deed, no matter how strongly I felt about them, because it\u2019s my only form of future financial security. The risk of having that taken from me should a relationship sour means leaving me highly vulnerable. I\u2019m a disabled woman who struggles to work and will never be in a position to buy another home should I lose my current one. I would happily buy a joint home with a partner but even still, I\u2019d keep my current place and rent it out. \n\nI do feel like if OP was a man and this was his girlfriend\u2019s home and finances, there\u2019d be a different response. A woman sets herself up financially and takes steps to secure that and it\u2019s applauded as being sensible. A man does it and it\u2019s seen as a red flag for abuse. And I\u2019m not disagreeing - it can be, but not always. \n\nI really don\u2019t see where BF is wrong here when you actually look at what\u2019s being said.", "No, he really isn't suggesting it. Quite the contrary - he offered financial support for her to quit her job because she was unhappy there, not because he wanted her reliant on him. He's made it clear that he wants her to find something that gets her out of the house/keeps her engaged with people, e.g. a hobby/volunteer position. It's not a stretch to think that he'd be equally happy for her to find another job.", "If they had kids, or he was pushing her to stay home, I would agree. But he's not. He's just fully funding her life. Nothing is stopping her from saving from her \"allowance\" or getting part time work.", "He never said \"everything's ours\", she just wishes it was, and he never said \"my house my rules\", just \"my house\". Ever heard the expression \"give them an inch and they'll take a mile\"? Well he started off giving her a mile.", "She\u2019s not a SAHM, they don\u2019t have kids.", "So she can get a job.", "You understand that in most states premarital assets go to the person who had them prior to the marriage in a divorce?  You understand real estate doesn\u2019t always increase in value?  She is a college educated teacher. She can be working in a month if they divorce.  A house takes time to sell to get liquidity. She should ask for a simple prenup. The prenup insures he gets his assets (in most states he does anyway without a prenup) and she can get alimony, housing allowance (like $12,000 immediately to cover 8 months rent) and some lump sum like $25,000 to help her move on).", ">Seriously. Fuck that.\n\nYeah, letting her live rent free and funding her life of leisure. What an asshole!", "Agree.\n\nWhoever\u2019s side you\u2019re on here, the whole set up isn\u2019t smart. Not just because of the power imbalance and potential for abuse, but because things happen - major medical issues, global financial crash - which could deplete whatever liquid wealth he has. \n\nBeing completely reliant on another person in any form - be that financially, emotionally, physically, etc - is a dangerous move even in relationships that are perfectly healthy. It\u2019s leaves the dependee highly vulnerable should the support come to an end for any reason. \n\nI don\u2019t think the boyfriend is being abusive in this situation but I still think OP is being stupid to be so reliant on him - which is, I suspect, why she\u2019s so upset at not being put on the deed. She knows she\u2019s got a good thing going and doesn\u2019t want to stop it, but also knows she\u2019s leaving herself vulnerable if they separate. \n\n I strongly suggest OP stop pushing the deed issue and instead use this incredible gift to pursue a career she enjoys. Not just for her financial security, but for her own worth and purpose.", "Yeah I see both sides. If I was the owner I would be hesitant to add my partner and if I were the partner I would be hesitant going in with nothing. But you kinda have to have faith. I think taking one step at a time, if the relationship has no other red flags, I would see it as free rent for the foreseeable future, I cand cut back my hours at work, and/or pursue my passion", "I agree wholeheartedly with you. If the roles were reversed, the whole comment section would be different. But like you already said, Op chose that life and now, she can't force herself onto her fianc\u00e9 assets just like that. \nIf she wants something of hers, she could get a job and already has the advantage to save her money to buy herself a house for herself.", "I\u2019ve seen situations like this a lot. They always end poorly.", "I was thinking about that expression too", "And if we build another house, which we have discussed, it will be in both names.\nA million + women would love to be her on such a good wicket.\nRunning away is a goodbye for me.", "Yeah sorry that would be contributing something to the household which again she isn't.", "Absolutely.\n\nI would not enter into an agreement with someone who encouraged me to be entirely financially dependent on them and did not offer any longer-term security.\n\nIt sounds like a terrible deal.", "Entirely in his financial power.\n\nSo if she doesn't find a hobby that meets with his approval or, seeing as the 2 of them have fuck all else to do, he just wants to mess with her that month, her \"allowance\" is cut.\n\nNope, fuck that.\n\nHe might not be an asshole right now, but the rules surrounding the allowance give an indication of potential future assholery and I wouldn't be on board.\n\nIt's one thing  staying at home if you have kids.\n\nOr if you're very very rich and you can jet off to summer in the C\u00f4te d'Azur but just farting about while he inspects your accuracy records for  your new archery hobby to see if you're putting the effort in..\n\nFUCK that so hard it can't sit for a week.", "Exactly.  The whole thing sounds grim.\n\nNo kids. No job. Just enough money to be comfortable *if they're careful*.\n\nNope. Sounds like a recipe for disaster and if it seems like she's looking a gift horse in the mouth it's because she correctly remembered what the Trojans did.", "Where does it say that he forbade her from continuing to work at her present job, or get a new one? What rules are you even talking about? The only requirement is that she not just sit on her ass and play phones all day. Holy fuck, is this what passes for modern feminism?\n\n\\-----EDIT-----\n\nYou edited your comment after my response above, and specifically said this:\n\n>Or if you're very very rich and you can jet off to summer in the C\u00f4te d'Azur but just farting about while he inspects your accuracy records for your new archery hobby to see if you're putting the effort in..\n\nHonestly I think you're unhinged, and you're just making shit up. Have fun with your alternate reality.", "Why are you a) making a bunch of assumptions about how he\u2019ll treat her with absolutely no evidence, and b) acting like she has no choice but to be unemployed? If she\u2019s worried about financial security, she can GET A JOB.", ">Nope. Sounds like a recipe for disaster and if it seems like she's looking a gift horse in the mouth it's because she correctly remembered what the Trojans did.\n\nIf only your parents correctly remembered what the Trojans did.", "1.Where did I state that he forbade her\n\n(nowhere, you're pulling that out of your ass)\n\n2.There are other unstipulated rules mentioned in OP's original post and the whole idea of it being entirely on his whim makes me uncomfortable \n\n\nIf \"make your own money and if someone else is looking after you financially, try and get some security so you're not entirely dependent\"\n\nis modern feminism then we should all be feminists?\n\nIs \"be a glorified sugar baby and don't even worry about what might happen if he gets sick of your face, no man ever used his superior financial position to his advantage\"\n\nis modern anti-feminism then I'm not surprised it's got such a horrific reputation", "No. \n\na) You always have to consider \"what if this all goes tits up?\"  and quite frankly people would be berating her ss being *dumb as a fucking rock* if she didn't\n\nb) I never said she has no choice but to be unemployed  just if I was giving up my job to fart about with this guy  I would like a little long-term security\n\nc) I indicated that I would not give up my JOB without financial security so that fucking sounds like I'm advising her to keep working  doesn't it  dumbass?"]}
