We got engaged 3 months ago and are planning on getting married in November and last night we were discussing some things about the wedding and the topic of our finical plan for once we are married which is where the argument started cause I asked him when I would be added onto the deed for the house.\n\nBackground: When my fiance was 23 his uncle died and left him a huge inheritance which has basically set him up for life, especially since he doesn't like super flashy things and only really spends money on his hobbies, and for the first 2 years after he struggled to date because he was always worried the girl he was dating was using him.\n\nI moved in with fiance a year into our relationship and he has never charged me for any bills and only expects me to pay for an luxury items I want, 9 months ago me and my fiance had a discussion in which he asked me if I wanted to stop working because I worked as a teacher and he could tell that my work wasn't making me happy, which he was right, we came to the agreement that I would stop working and some ground rules. The ground rules include that he would give me allowance every month and that he expected me to not just sit at home all day on my phone because he wants me to find hobbies and passions because we both don't want children. I was totally on board with the rules and quitting really helped my mental health.\n\nSo when I brought up having my name added to the house deed he got really quiet. He told me that he didnt feel comfortable adding my name to the deed as the house had been fully paid off by him before we had even met and he felt that he is the one responsible for all the payments. This made me upset because I thought he was trying to say that I was using him and we are getting married so I thought the house would become \"ours\". He told me that things will become ours but this was the first house he ever bought and that he wanted to keep something for himself. He told me that if we decide to change houses or have one built, which we have discussed before, that he would have both our names put on the deed. This made me more upset because if he is willing to do it on the possible next house why cant he do for our current house? We got into an argument and I left to go to my sister's apartment and texted my friend about the situation and she told me that I was being an AH and overreacting but I don't see it that way and I think he should be willing to put my name on the deed.\n\nAm I overreacting and throwing away a good relationship? Or is he being an AH by not seeing my side?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just woke up after posting this last night and have been reading through a lot of the comments and I know that I messed up and I'm already planning on apologizing to my fiance. I wanted to answer some common questions people were asking me. I called the money my fiance gives me an \"allowance\" and some people said that it was a red flag, that is the word I use to describe it but its really more of a salary as my fiance has me listed as an employee at one of his companies to make it all legal and so that I can have health insurance and it is all in a legal contract, his idea, that protects me incase we do split up. My allowance is 5 grand a month which I know is a lot and I'm realizing that my fiance has put me in financial position most people would die for and I need to acknowledge that. Some people have also talked about how much money my fiance has, I dont know the exact number but he has told me the range and shown me his finances and has told me based of off what we spend now we could live this way for another 100 years. I will talk about a prenup with him if he stills wants to be together.", "created_utc": 1680923251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12f9g1l/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_fiance_because_he_told/", "score": 5154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I think it's a very bad power imbalance to have that in a relationship. \n\nThat said, he's coming at this from this is his house and he's already worried about girls only dating him for his money. If he puts your name on a house he owns 100% of, he's basically giving you half of a house. And that's a big ask, especially if you aren't even married yet.  \n\nThere are probably ways to address both of your concerns. But I would probably not run headlong into \"husband pays for everything\" when he's not thinking about this in terms of \"we both own everything.\" If the important assets are his separately, it's probably not safe (for you) to stop working for a long period of time.", "YTA, it's his house before you met.

Yes, you will be married, but you did nothing to build his wealth, so how is it unreasonable that he would want to protect pre-existing assets in case of divorce?  If the situations were reversed, you'd feel the same.\n\nHe is very lucky, and he is sharing that with you.  Try to look at it from his perspective and maybe you'd come off as less of a gold digger.", "YTA.   You don't suddenly just get to own a house just because you married the person who owns it.

You shouldn't have quit your job before you were married. It's reasonable that you're feeling insecure about him having full financial control over you and want to literally have something to your name in case something goes wrong because if things don't work out in the next few years, you'll have lost a career and not have anything to show for it.\n\nThat said, his house is his. If he puts your name on it, all of a sudden you'd be able to force him to sell in the event of a divorce. Him wanting to wait a while before buying joint property makes perfect sense because it's more of a financial risk for him. Him having an inheritance before you get married means that money stays his regardless.\n\nYou probably need to go back to work tbh. He's not likely to put your name on the house and pushing will end the relationship if he already has fears about being used for money. If you want this to work, you probably need your own money. Working sucks but it brings peace of mind.", "You asked. He answered. Now you all need to have a frank and honest conversation about how your financial situation will be for the rest of your life.\n\nGood luck.", "Certain songs comes to mind..", "You're the greedy Ahole!  \nYTA", "You are literally being handed an easy life of being taken care of by someone else and you\u2019re throwing it away because you got greedy for more? He should be worried you\u2019re taking advantage of him   Yta", "It was his before you why is this an issue? If you need to be on a deed so bad just push to build or buy a new one but let him keep what\u2019s his his YTA", "YTA he is doing a lot for you, because he loves you and cares about you but you also want the house and you're upset when he said no to one thing", "Gentlest possible YTA. \n\nWhy isn't it enough that he fully supports you? He clearly has a lot of feelings tied into his inheritance and protecting himself from being taken advantage of. Different property arrangements can exist in a marriage, it isn't always \"what's yours is mine\" by default. \n\nPlease go to marriage counseling and see a family lawyer, as well as financial planner. It's better to talk about money before you jump into marriage, so as unfortunate as the argument was and as uncomfortable as the conversation will be, better to thresh it out now. It will save you time and money, as well as a lot of emotional pain, later on. \n\nAnd as to your hurt feelings about how you feel like it means he doesn't trust you: they are understandable and valid. But as someone who went into my marriage with significantly more money and property than my partner, protecting your individual assets is about having a safety net. We have a shared account and free use of each other's properties, but what's his is his and what's mine is mine. Going on a decade now and we're great. My parents have a separate-property arrangement, too, and they're going on fifty years of a loving marriage. (Also, I bought my first house at 21 and spent years slaving to pay off the loan while I was in law school, so I don't even consider my partner's input when it comes to that house and he knows to butt out because that place is special to me.)\n\nAnyway, I hope this gives you some perspective and that it works out for the best in the end.", "YNTA, and neither is he.\n\nBut without your own income, you will become totally dependant on him, which is bad.

ESH", "NAH - I think you both need to have a frank discussion about finances with probably a pre-marital agreement that meets in the middle. \n\nFrank has a right to want to protect property that he had before even meeting you and you have the right to want to make sure you are protected in the case that you guys don't work out, especially since you gave up your job. So these are real issues for you guys to discuss and find a solution that doesn't make him feel taken advantage of and doesn't leave you on your own if things don't work out.", "ESH. The house is a premarital asset and you contributed nothing it. It\u2019s wrong for you to insist he put you on the deed. If you want rights over the home you live in,  you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to move into his house. You should have insisted that you buy a house together and by together I mean you both provide the finances. My problem with your fianc\u00e9 is he\u2019s created a dynamic there is an imbalance of power because you are totally dependent on him financially.  Because his money was inherited and the house was purchased before the marriage, you\u2019re not going to be entitled to anything should you two divorce. \n\nEither your fianc\u00e9 knows that and doesn\u2019t care or it hasn\u2019t occurred to him at all even though he should be looking out for you.

You\u2019ve not put forward any financial contribution to purchase the other half of the property from him. You don\u2019t get to just demand you get half because you\u2019re getting married. That home should be a protected asset prior to signing marriage papers", "YTA, when I married my husband the house we lived in was his from before he met me.  I helped pay the bills.  A few years later when we sold his place and bought a different place both our names went on the deed.", "YTA. Why exactly do you think you deserve half of the house? He paid it off himself with nothing from you. Premarital assets are not divided up in the event of a divorce, so even if you were married, you would have no claim to it. \n\nYou said, \"He struggled to date because he was always  worried the girl he was dating was using him.\" I don't want to accuse you of this without more evidence, but no matter how you put it, financially, you're getting a lot out of this relationship. You're able to quit your job and be able to live well and pursue your other interests. That's something many people would kill to have. You have to be honest with yourself cause you are coming across as greedy here. Why are you with him? Because he can provide such a great lifestyle, or would you be with him no matter what his financial status is? If you're not \"using him,\" then why are you offended by what he wants? He said you'll share the ownership of any future houses, so you'll eventually own a house. Why exactly does it have to be this house?", "YTA. The house is his. He can keep it in his name if he wants or add you. IF HE WANTS TO. You have no rights to any of his possessions before you are married(and even during marriage it can get very technical).

You didn\u2019t contribute to it. It makes me a little uncomfortable that you are fully comfortable being completely supported by him, not contributing anything, and still asking for more. Someone from the outside looking in might think you are actually using him for his money. Also - You really should think about continuing to work after you get married. If you ever get divorced, it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t get much in this situation, as his inheritance likely won\u2019t be counted towards alimony, you are capable of working, and you won\u2019t have any children.

Y\u2019all should do a lot of talking, and seek out advice from a financial planner, and maybe lawyers, for a pre-nup\u2014they don\u2019t only protect the \u201cricher\u201d partner.", "NAH\n\nYou guys need a prenup.\n\nHe needs one to protect his assets.

We got engaged 3 months ago and are planning on getting married in November and last night we were discussing some things about the wedding and the topic of our finical plan for once we are married which is where the argument started cause I asked him when I would be added onto the deed for the house.\n\nBackground: When my fiance was 23 his uncle died and left him a huge inheritance which has basically set him up for life, especially since he doesn't like super flashy things and only really spends money on his hobbies, and for the first 2 years after he struggled to date because he was always worried the girl he was dating was using him. \n\nI moved in with fiance a year into our relationship and he has never charged me for any bills and only expects me to pay for an luxury items I want, 9 months ago me and my fiance had a discussion in which he asked me if I wanted to stop working because I worked as a teacher and he could tell that my work wasn't making me happy, which he was right, we came to the agreement that I would stop working and some ground rules.

No. That\u2019s not how that works. And if I were him I would have you sign a prenup.", "YTA\n\nI hope he dumps you.", "YTA -Property acquired before marriage is not community property. My husband had a house before I met him and was making mortgage payments on it. After we were married 5 years he put my name on the house in case something happened to him I would have a home. He also at that time took out life insurance to ensure my comfort to some degree should he pass. My brother had a home and he kept it in his name. His wife divorced him after a few years and she thought half the house was hers. Nope.", "YTA about the house. Pre-marriage asset, paid for with an inheritance before he even knew you, you do not contribute to its upkeep in any way, yada yada yada. \n\nMore broadly: you\u2019ve surrendered any semblance of financial independence by quitting your job to be a SAHW for two adults and no kids and do \u201chobbies\u201d.

Sounds like he makes good money, however he's doing it it's certainly not by being a good judge of character.", "YTA in my opinion. as another person on here mentioned, you both should talk with divorce attorneys and agree on a prenup. after marriage, individual assets dont automatically become shared assets. hes offering you to quit your job and pay for your hobbies... but you want more. hes willing to have your name on the house that you two buy in the future together. this is fair, in my opinion. If youre worried about not having your own income and wanting a safety net in the form of shared ownership in his house, then perhaps dont quit your job.", "You two are so not ready for marriage.

You don\u2019t pay any bills. In fact, he was generous enough to notice that you weren\u2019t happy at your job and has been supporting you in finding hobbies and things that you enjoy instead of working. Most people aren\u2019t that lucky! You aren\u2019t entitled to assets that your fianc\u00e9 acquired before he even met you. \n\nBe thankful that your fianc\u00e9 is in a financial position that doesn\u2019t require you to work. Stop being greedy.", "Deadly women vibes", "YTA!  He needs to rethink this relationship.

You're extremely greedy. You don't even have to work anymore because you're living off his money. But now you're demanding ownership of a house that you didn't pay a penny for?

You need to keep working and make your own money, even if he suggested it. Also, if the property is pre-marriage, it\u2019s his (at least in my State).

He\u2019s been very kind and has provided for you. Most people don\u2019t get the luxury to not have to work and focus on hobbies that make them happy and he\u2019s made it so you can.

Your want to have a name on the deed is understandable, but so is his to not include it. Strive to build something alongside him, talk to him and make a plan, but for god\u2019s sake, TALK TO HIM.

Since time is linear, I did not have any of the information in the edit when I posted my comment. That she already has a legal contract protecting her \"allowance\" in case of breakup, that addresses a lot of potential concerns I (and many others, despite being shouted down) saw in the original post. So she seems to already know she overreacted about the house and is going to fix it. \n\nI'll just add that I think it's pretty funny that everyone viewed her as lazy and privileged, ignoring that the fianc\u00e9 appears to have gotten a 8 figure inheritance from money he did nothing to earn himself when he was 23 years old.

And while asking for half the house may not be the right ask, but she has the right to figure out how her financial future will be protected in this agreement they made.", "Exactly. She is in a very good situation where she can take the time to find a job she likes.", "Imagine marrying someone who\u2019s asking you to live in a house they don\u2019t want to share.

What else will he \u201cnot feel like\u201d sharing in the future? What recourse will she have if he decides to unreasonably limit her allowance?

I suspect that's why you're digging very hard into wanting something concrete, like your name on a deed.\n\nIt sounds like you two need to start working on a pre-nup. These things need to be discussed and a pre-nup makes those conversations happen. Your fianc\u00e9 isn't wrong to want the house he brought/inherited before he met you to remain a pre-marital asset, and any property brought during the relationship to be a marital asset. That's common. And seeing as you had 2 years living rent free while working as a teacher, you must have some significant savings you'd like to remain a pre-marital asset. I will admit my partner had been saving for a house and brought it while we were together but I haven't contributed to the mortgage or deposit or anything.

What's the harm with him keeping the house in only his name? You still live there for free (not hating. I'm a SAHM). It's a special thing for him. He paid off that house. It's his house.

The amount he is sharing is more than generous. You don\u2019t have to be a teacher if it stresses you that bad. Get a different job, use that income towards your own property he isn\u2019t on, and when you all buy or build a house get a joint deed.

But not an AH for having concerns about shared property going forward.\n\nRegardless of what you decide together, you need to be on the same page. But discuss and decide together. This is a big thing, and probably won't be settled in one conversation.", "YTA you guys need to work out some kind of pre-nup. \n\nAnd if you are going to quit working (I wish I could do that, haha) but make sure some of your hobbies is something that could lead to a job.

The house is his, he paid for it, and I find it a little wild you\u2019d end things over it. He mentioned if y\u2019all got a house together after you were married, both your names would be on it. Which would make a lot more sense then him adding you onto the house he bought. However, if it\u2019s more about underlying fear about lack of assets in the marriage- I get it but there are solutions. \n\nOP, if your fianc\u00e9 suggested supporting you due to the fact that you aren\u2019t fulfilled at your job, that\u2019s incredibly generous.

Big mistake, in my opinion. \n\nYou were fortunate enough to find someone that will give you a free ride and allow you to quit your job, and you immediately alienated him with your demand to have a 50% interest in a house that predates your marriage. \n\nTo be honest, it would be in his best interest for you guys to sign a prenup, and it would be recorded that this house is 100% his. In the future, any real property would very likely be in both your names.\n\nThe way you came across is that you are jumping into the relationship (and his assets) with both feet. \nIf I were him, I'd definitely see that as a red flag and seriously reconsider if this is the kind of person that I would want to marry.

This is why prenups and premarital financial counseling exist. He should want to do both of these things- if you divorced, depending on state laws, you might be entitled to a significant portion of his assets and/or alimony....way more than half of that house. You are playing a risky game by relying on him for income. The moment your relationship might end, you won't have anything to fall back on. This inequality is also often used as a tool to manipulate... who hasn't heard \"I pay the bills, why aren't you cooking? Why aren't you doing \\_\\_\\_? Why aren't you having sex with me?\" This is why women are increasingly becoming participants in the workforce- a man holding all of the power (money) allowed them to put women into situations that they didn't want to be in. In my opinion, you have no right to be on the deed to the house. I might feel differently if you had a job or had kids.\n\nYour concern exists because you're scared of being homeless. That fear should always exist if you elect not to work.", "YTA. He deserves an apology. This is his place. His bachelor pad/house. Why do you want it? His confirmation that your name will be added to the deed of the NEXT house you buy together, lacks any patriarchy-rooted tropes and is normal for any mature relationship. Entitlement doesnt look good on anyone.", "I think this really depends. Is he asking her to sign a prenup? If so then yeah this is a major concern. If not she has no leg to stand on. If there's no prenup and she's going into the marriage with hi already supporting her then if the marriage ends he will have what I assume would be a pretty expensive alimony deal. The only reason she'd be asking to be on a house that's already paid for and she didn't contribute to is so she has access to half it's worth of the relationship fails.", "NAH He has a right to refuse to share his assets. Though I also understand how this creates a potentially dangerous situation for you, with no means of income. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for asking but should respect his no. If he says no, come to some other arrangement for you to get some level of security. Either get a job, even if just freelance/part time or agree on a fixed allowance (enough to have savings).", "ESH. If you get divorced, which is how 1/3 of all marriages end, then he either has to pay you out or loses the house. You have not contributed to the house, so there is no reason to add you to the deed. \n\nThe reason I am putting ESH instead of YTA is because you\u2019re not working and he\u2019s supporting that idiocy. You\u2019re not planning to have kids, go find a job, because otherwise you\u2019ll never be independent from him which is ridiculous. You didn\u2019t like your job, fine, find a different one! It takes most people years to find a job they like or at least not completely hate - at your age I didn\u2019t like my job either. Fast forward 15 years and my job is something I like, that makes me proud, and that has provided me with a number of friends over the years. At least work half days, or something. If you need skills, start out by volunteering for a charity. Being 26 and deciding that work isn\u2019t for you so you\u2019ll sponge off your rich husband forever is just immature and it WILL come back to haunt you.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019d like to add, if the roles were reversed in this scenario and it was a woman bringing an inherited house into the relationship, the judgment would be super clear and everyone would be clamouring for her to protect HER house. OP, get a job. Retrain if needs be, you don\u2019t have to be a teacher - maybe teaching adults might work better, for example?", "NAH simply because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re approaching this from a place of bad faith/bad intentions.\n\nLike some others said, you two should communicate better and clearly lay out all your concerns about money/assets and your future together. I get where you\u2019re both coming from and I\u2019m choosing to believe your intentions are good. \n\nAll this being said, you are way too young to give up on having any shred of financial independence. I am also not happy at my\njob and it is killing my mental health, but I can\u2019t afford to quit and rediscover my passions and hobbies. You are extremely lucky to have that opportunity. Don\u2019t completely give up on working, but use the opportunity your fianc\u00e9 gave you to find yourself and potentially pursue a new career. This will give you some financial independence while you can still make whatever work you have be flexible enough to accommodate your mental health needs; it will also show him that you\u2019re not completely set on financially relying on him for the rest of your life. Even though he is pretty financially secure right now, something like this could change in a second and it\u2019d be beneficial for both of you if you were to maintain a career and steady income. If he happens to lose all his money in 15 years, being in your 40s with nothing to show for in your resume would make things even tougher for both of you.\n\nEdit: About the house: Please try to understand that this is also not just about the money. Didn\u2019t his uncle leave him the house and he finished paying for it? You can never be sure of what could happen in a marriage and the possibility of losing his home, inherited from a beloved relative, could just be very scary for him. Bring up potentially buying/building a new place, as you could have something that belongs to both of you and it\u2019s YOUR family home, while his place is still his.", "ESH If you want responsibility for the house, then you need to put your financial stake into it and start making payments to him to own a portion of the house. You're being very unreasonable and pretty immature. This difference between this house and one you two will purchase **together** is very clear. \n\nThat said, you 100% have rights to a joint account where he deposits his salary rather than an allowance.", "NAH. The way a married couple approaches their finances can be a complex and treacherous issue. Will you be fully combining your finances? Keep separate accounts? Something in between? \n\nThis is a topic that you and your fianc\u00e9 should sit and discuss long before you tie the knot\u2014 it will not become easier later.

Because I have a conscience and know right from wrong, I told him that I don\u2019t want any of the proceeds of the house. Not a cent. And do you know what he did in turn? He told me to continue living in the house for free with the kids and he\u2019ll keep paying the mortgage as child support. All I had to do was pay the bills. And he still pays half for any extras (Christmas gifts, school fees, elite sports, birthdays, trips). My one act of not being greedy set in motion a series of events which ultimately set the tone and made our divorce amicable. To this day I still live here (14 years later) with my current husband and my ex stays here freely so that the kids don\u2019t ever have to bounce around between homes. (He lives an 18 hour drive away 3 months a year and lives with us for work the remainder). Anyways, my point for sharing this is because after 10 years of marriage and two kids, I certainly had every right to take half. My name was on the deed and I voluntarily took it off.

I want to communicate with more people, so I make a lot of effort to be easy to understand. I'm literally the only one in my family who speaks English, so it can be difficult to have some feedback on my pronunciation and my grammar when writing.", "I do understand your perspective, and I agree taken at face value the set up has potential red flags but I feel you\u2019re really overlooking the fact that it was ultimately *her* choice to leave her job and the fact that it\u2019s still her responsibility to provide for herself. We shouldn\u2019t be overlooking the fact that OP has autonomy and responsibilities toward herself. She cannot expect others to set her up in life regardless of their wealth or assets. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing to say (from what I\u2019ve read) that he manipulated, coerced, or forced her to leave her job, nor anything to suggest he\u2019s preventing her from seeking other employment or retraining. \n\nHe\u2019s happy to give her an \u2018allowance\u2019, is actively encouraging her to pursue hobbies and activities, and is willing to jointly purchase/build their future home. \n\nShe\u2019s been given a golden and rare opportunity that most of us don\u2019t get - freedom to pursue whatever goals and passions you want, free from the restrictions of work or money. \n\nYes, it\u2019s worrying that she\u2019s potentially entering a marriage where she owns nothing, but that\u2019s her own choice if she does so. He\u2019s laid out what he\u2019s willing to give her and what he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s up to her to consider the risks and make a sensible decision. Her financial security is ultimately her responsibility, not her partner\u2019s, and if she chooses to continue the relationship with this set up, she\u2019s choosing to be 100% reliant on him. I would personally never choose that, precisely because as I\u2019ve said, it can lead to highly abusive situations from which escape is difficult or impossible, but \u2018can\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018will\u2019. Again, it\u2019s OP\u2019s responsibility to consider the risks based on the facts of the situation and what she\u2019s been told. \n\nBoyfriend is, rightly, ensuring his *own* financial security should the relationship ever go sour. Relationships don\u2019t require you to share *everything*. Assets earned/gifted outside of a relationship remain (at least in UK law) the sole property of the owner, and rightly so. \n\nI own a home and I wouldn\u2019t put *any* partner on my mortgage deed, no matter how strongly I felt about them, because it\u2019s my only form of future financial security. The risk of having that taken from me should a relationship sour means leaving me highly vulnerable. I\u2019m a disabled woman who struggles to work and will never be in a position to buy another home should I lose my current one. I would happily buy a joint home with a partner but even still, I\u2019d keep my current place and rent it out. \n\nI do feel like if OP was a man and this was his girlfriend\u2019s home and finances, there\u2019d be a different response. A woman sets herself up financially and takes steps to secure that and it\u2019s applauded as being sensible. A man does it and it\u2019s seen as a red flag for abuse.

Quite the contrary - he offered financial support for her to quit her job because she was unhappy there, not because he wanted her reliant on him. He's made it clear that he wants her to find something that gets her out of the house/keeps her engaged with people, e.g. a hobby/volunteer position. It's not a stretch to think that he'd be equally happy for her to find another job.", "If they had kids, or he was pushing her to stay home, I would agree. But he's not. He's just fully funding her life. Nothing is stopping her from saving from her \"allowance\" or getting part time work.", "He never said \"everything's ours\", she just wishes it was, and he never said \"my house my rules\", just \"my house\". Ever heard the expression \"give them an inch and they'll take a mile\"?

You understand real estate doesn\u2019t always increase in value?  She is a college educated teacher. She can be working in a month if they divorce.  A house takes time to sell to get liquidity. She should ask for a simple prenup. The prenup insures he gets his assets (in most states he does anyway without a prenup) and she can get alimony, housing allowance (like $12,000 immediately to cover 8 months rent) and some lump sum like $25,000 to help her move on).", ">Seriously. Fuck that.\n\nYeah, letting her live rent free and funding her life of leisure. What an asshole!", "Agree.\n\nWhoever\u2019s side you\u2019re on here, the whole set up isn\u2019t smart. Not just because of the power imbalance and potential for abuse, but because things happen - major medical issues, global financial crash - which could deplete whatever liquid wealth he has. \n\nBeing completely reliant on another person in any form - be that financially, emotionally, physically, etc - is a dangerous move even in relationships that are perfectly healthy. It\u2019s leaves the dependee highly vulnerable should the support come to an end for any reason. \n\nI don\u2019t think the boyfriend is being abusive in this situation but I still think OP is being stupid to be so reliant on him - which is, I suspect, why she\u2019s so upset at not being put on the deed. She knows she\u2019s got a good thing going and doesn\u2019t want to stop it, but also knows she\u2019s leaving herself vulnerable if they separate. \n\n I strongly suggest OP stop pushing the deed issue and instead use this incredible gift to pursue a career she enjoys. Not just for her financial security, but for her own worth and purpose.", "Yeah I see both sides. If I was the owner I would be hesitant to add my partner and if I were the partner I would be hesitant going in with nothing. But you kinda have to have faith. I think taking one step at a time, if the relationship has no other red flags, I would see it as free rent for the foreseeable future, I cand cut back my hours at work, and/or pursue my passion", "I agree wholeheartedly with you. If the roles were reversed, the whole comment section would be different. But like you already said, Op chose that life and now, she can't force herself onto her fianc\u00e9 assets just like that. \nIf she wants something of hers, she could get a job and already has the advantage to save her money to buy herself a house for herself.", "I\u2019ve seen situations like this a lot.

Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with assuming you would both own the house once you got married. I thought that was the point of getting married to build a life together. He sounds like he's trying to have financial control over you and the relationship and one person having all that power usually isn't a good thing. If anything ever goes south you're gonna be screwed because you won't own anything in the relationship and you'll have been unemployed for a long time. NTA.", "NTA. I don't think it's an overreaction. I'm concerned that you're allowing him to have total financial control over your life, though. I'm a teacher myself and know its highs and lows: if not teaching, please find another job, even if it's part-time, so that you have at least that financial independence to fall back on - not to mention connections to people outside of your SO.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if he wants to protect you and ensure you're never thrown out into the hedgerows upon his death, it would be a good idea to add your name to the deed of the house. Also for anything related to the house where he might be absent - either out of the country or in hospital, for example - then you can still do what needs to be done.\n\nHowever, you could also do something like a prenuptial agreement where, in the event of a divorce (worst-case scenario!) then he retains full ownership of the house, as he brought it to the marriage.", "NTA what kind of marriage do you want? He\u2019s not all in. He has put you in a position were you have no income, no assets, are dependent on him. What if he leaves you? You will have nothing, years of lost income, and a gap on your resume. He\u2019s using you. Don\u2019t listen to those saying you don\u2019t contribute. He\u2019s not \u201ccontributing\u201d either, this was handed to him!

As someone who can understand your fianc\u00e9s perspective (come from a family with money),  I think he\u2019s not understanding that you won\u2019t have any security if the house is not also in your name. My mom went through this when she married my dad, cause my grandma didn\u2019t want his house to be in both their names either. My mom wasn\u2019t comfortable with that because god forbid something happened to him she would have had nowhere to go. What they agreed on is that the house would also be in her name, and if they ever sold it, any profit that would be made from the house would be split between the two of them. So say the house was bought at 250k and sold for 300k, then the 50k profit would be split and the 250k went to my dad. It wasn\u2019t about the money, but about security that someone won\u2019t just put you out on the street when they want. Also, he was the one who offered the allowance plan, without discussing with you that that would mean you wouldn\u2019t have the house in your name. I\u2019d personally would rather have a job and house security, rather than no job and no house security.\n\nEdit: with the first house my parents may have actually had my dad put in his will that the house would go to my mom if anything happened, plus the sales profit thing.

I'm definitely not saying anything she's doing that but if she's worried about having nothing to her name she should use the allowance she receives from him to invest into something on her own. Or maybe find a new career than teaching. She should be grateful that he was concerned about her well being and suggested that, however maybe she should do something on her own instead of relying on him. She can go back to school, find a new job she loves, work part time, something that can allow her to not rely on him financially.

I had to go to a lawyer and sign papers saying that I agreed to not be on the deed. Which I did not. The Lawyer pointed out that it is normal for the wife to be on the deed for this very reason. \nMy husband thought since he pays the mortgage only he needs to be on the deed. The Lawyer said No it doesnt matter if ur Uncle Fester pays the Mortgage. That both Spouses should be on the deed. So the bank cant take it immediately if he dies.\n\n If my husband dies I'll have to fight the bank to keep our house. We have been married 12 years & have 2 young children together. I already asked him to change this and put me on the deed. He said he didn't want to pay the Lawyer another $150 to add me to the deed. But this could save me a whole lot of headaches if the worst should happen.\n\n Also we do not have Wills yet. Also I don't have have any credit cards in my name so I therefore have no credit. I don't have any bills in my name. So I can't build credit that way. I contribute $ into the bills and buy all the groceries but Since none are in my name. I literally don't exist in terms of credit.\n\n I'm 40 and am totally Fucked if he dies before I can fix these finacial problems. He is borderline diabetic and it could turn into type 2 diabetes I'd he can't lose weight and get his blood sugar levels down. I'm worried I won't be able to take care of our girls properly if something should happen to him.\n\n He figures that I'd be fine since his life insurance money goes to me if he died but that doesn't mean the bank won't fight me on the house ownership. He said well u could just pay off the rest of the Mortgage and own the house.\n\n But that's still a problem since the house is not in my name I can't sell it to buy a smaller house.

It\u2019s a CHOICE she made for herself. She was unhappy in her job and he gave her the opportunity to quit her job on the condition she would find a goal in life that makes her happy, e.g. hobbies, passions. But I can also imagine the goal could be studying or a job she actually likes. Yes, this CHOICE makes her temporarily financially dependent on her future husband, but it\u2019s also a luxury to be able to make this kind of change in your life and invest in yourself without having to work at a crappy job that drains your energy.\n\nHe does NOT want her to be a SAHW as he explicitly stated he doesn\u2019t want her to sit at home all day doing nothing. He doesn\u2019t want a dependent wife. He wants her to figure out what makes her happy and go for it. And they BOTH don\u2019t want children.\n\nOn top of that, he never charged her for any bills and she only paid for her own luxury items. This means that at the time she was still working, she could have saved up a large part of her income. After she quit her job, he gave her an allowance for her to spend on luxury items, so she didn\u2019t have to spend her savings. If she has no savings from before quitting her job and spend her whole income on luxury items, that\u2019s on her. \n\nI am actually in a similar situation. I live in my partner\u2019s house and at the moment he pays all the bills and I do not contribute financially. He gave me the opportunity to quit a job that drained me and made me unhappy. Currently I am studying again and my goal is to switch careers. It\u2019s a luxury I can do this without worrying about money and bills getting paid. The flip side is, not having an income of my own makes me financially vulnerable. I am very aware of that (it also feels not emancipated). But I have a savings account I could rely on for a while if my relationship would end. And of course I would have to get a job to sustain myself and probably stop studying. (We don\u2019t have children, but if we are lucky enough to have them in the future, we will make a different financial plan, because children are a game changer. If it\u2019s mutually decided one gives up their career to stay home to take care of BOTH your children, that person needs to be financially compensated for that.)\n\nYTA, because I think OP is really entitled to think her future husband should give her half of his assets (mostly from an inheritance before their relationship) she paid nothing for, while she doesn\u2019t financially contribute at the moment. I think she\u2019s lucky her future husband isn\u2019t re-evaluating their relationship because of this.\n\nI do agree OP should think about her financial independence (within this relationship and after an unfortunate divorce) but demanding he gives her half of his assets isn\u2019t the way to go.", "\u201cShe can choose to start working!!\u201d Okay? Stay at home spouses or parents is an entirely valid thing if that\u2019s what both parties decide is best for their relationship - that doesn\u2019t mean the stay at home partner deserves to be vulnerable or can never discuss finances/assets. He\u2019s also allowed to feel anxious about putting someone on a house they didn\u2019t pay into.\n\nPersonally, I think she should go back to work for now, he should sell the house after marriage, and they should buy a new one. Whether or not she continues to work or not, a new stay at home arrangement can be figured out when they\u2019re in a position where she doesn\u2019t feel vulnerable and he doesn\u2019t feel used.\n\n\nHe would also likely benefit from some self reflection. Having a fear of being used for your money and then paying for all of your girlfriends living expenses at year 1 and then for her to stay home at year 2 is pretty incongruent and is probably going to lead to some resentment on his part that isn\u2019t fair.", "As a woman, I would say that he did not force her to stop work.

To share assets with someone in a marriage is viewed as a statement of love and trust, so it's reasonable she's upset about that rather than it being that shes upset she doesn't get to own the house (and get it through a divorce).\n\nJust as she didn't have to take up on his offer, he didn't have to offer anything to her just bc he saw he could help. He's showing contradictory behavior, he shouldn't be allowing her to do things that makes him not trust her cause it really isn't surprising that someone would stop working a stressful job if their partner told them they'd support them.

He didn\u2019t get an \u2018allowance\u2019 as such, we had joint finances anyway and he had access to the joint account which my salary went into anyway. He took a few months out and had a think about what he wanted to do and then found a job he really enjoys. It\u2019s never going to make him a fortune but he is happy and gets to be outdoors and enjoys life which is far more important than a huge salary. It was never controlling in any way, it was actually giving him his freedom! During that time we moved house and due to him being unemployed it was better for me to take the mortgage in my name only rather than include him. Once he went back to work we didn\u2019t add him because it seemed pointless, we are married after all so he would get everything anyway if I died. Never had any issues with it.

If they buy together later on she will be on those deeds but the place was his before they even met and she is living for free.

(Eg if the property is worth $100K at the marriage, and appreciates $10K during the marriage, then she could have a community property interest (1/2) in that $10K, but no rights to the $100K value that is his separate property).

As for my relationship let me fill you in on what happened next\u2026luckily he was settled in a job he loved but I became very ill. I had to stop working and at one point we were pretty much hoping for the best outcome being that I would survive but thought it was unlikely I would be able to work again. Luckily we live in the U.K. because if it had been USA we would have been bankrupt and homeless by the end of it all. Also luckily I had always made sure we saved and stayed out of debt and we had a lot of equity in that beautiful house I bought so we survived by selling it. We ended up in a studio apartment and even luckier I did start to recover, we eventually got to the point I was spending more time at home than in hospital.\nHe worked his butt off so we could just about get by, he came home exhausted and still did 99% of the housework because it was difficult for me to even get myself to the toilet and back to bed again. He took care of me, he did everything he could to get us through that period of time. He never once complained or even got frustrated. He showed only love and compassion even though he was pretty much married to someone who was basically a bedridden skeleton for around two years. I am a very stubborn woman and defied some docs opinions and I did slowly start to recover but it was a long process. At the point that we knew that the long term implications were bad/life changing but that I would be mostly ok I gave him an out. I told him that the parameters of our marriage had totally changed and that if he wanted to go, wanted to be able to travel again, wanted to have children or any of the stuff that folk take for granted that it would be totally amicable and I would understand. I told him to take 6 months to consider it while I tried to build up my strength further but I honestly meant it when I told him I would understand and I would never hold it against him. He said he didn\u2019t care about anything else and just wanted to be with me. Eventually when I was well enough to try to work he agreed to move away from his family and friends to give me the best option to get back to work (the only reason I was able to was because of covid lock down, I woke up, worked from bed and slept - he barely saw me awake other than to kiss me good night for over a year). I still have a long way to go but I am at least a functioning person again these days and we support each other rather than it all being one sided. My career is getting back on track and soon I should be back in the position to call the shots about where I am located so we will go back close to his friends and family. \nThere was definitely no fairytale though and it was far from perfect. During all of this I thought many times about the words you say when you marry, for better or worse and in sickness or in health specifically. We say them so easily but when it really happens it is a very different matter. Never once did he give up on me or see me as a burden or let the situation get him down. He did everything that he could to get us through. He never once considered taking the easy way out (even though I laid out an offer for him to do so!). There is no MVP in a good relationship because the tides are always changing. I didn\u2019t choose to marry my husband because he was a model or earned a fortune. I chose to say yes to him because he was so selfless that he always tried to put me first and I had never had anyone love me quite like that before. He was never insecure about me earning more than him, my having close male friends or anything like that. He was just proud of me and proud to be with me. He was always happy to do what I wanted but he never made it obvious or did it for praise but I could see it and it made me want to be more selfless for him so he still got \u2018his way\u2019 too (even down to silly things like what type of food to get) although I had to trick him (by pretending what I knew his favourite was is what I wanted) into taking it sometimes \ud83d\ude02. It sounds cheesy but it\u2019s true. I hardly eat any meat but his favourite dish is meat based and the way his mum made it for example, I asked his mum to teach me the way she cooked it and for years he thought I loved it too and was so pleased I made it for him regularly. Life is far from perfect but we have weathered more storms than many others have because of putting the other person first. You can only do that when it is a two way street though otherwise you have no one looking out for your own best interest. It\u2019s a rare thing to find I guess so we are very lucky in that sense.
