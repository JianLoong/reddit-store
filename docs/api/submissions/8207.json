He does help with the cooking some days and once a month he cleans the entire house. The reason the house is a mess is because of my kids and him . Honestly he eats all the snacks in a day so wherever he is that day it is covered in plastic wrappers. He does not help with the kids besides dressing my son and cutting his hair. I usually dress them and take them baths honestly I think it\u2019s been a year since has helped with bathing them.
