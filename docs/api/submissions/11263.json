I only have someone check in on my cat briefly every day I\u2019m gone to put out fresh food, leave some treats, and make sure the water fountain is working. My cat is skittish and skedaddles to his favorite hiding place whenever someone who is not me comes in the apartment. Regardless, I make sure anyone who enters my apartment knows that I have two cameras and their locations; which are at his favorite napping spots of course, and that the cameras don\u2019t record all the time, only when I open the app to check on my kitty.", "NTA. The fact that he called you, YELLING at you,  instead of having any faith that you took proper precautions about the cat before opening the window is just the icing on the cake.\n\nEdit: Come to think of it, if there was no sensor on the kitchen window, the idea that he just \u2018happened\u2019 to be watching the feed when you opened the window but wasn\u2019t watching any of the other feed seems far fetched. This may be why ALL the men are doubling down. Were they all watching, and know they\u2019ll be in deep doodoo if one of them cracks and tells the women?\n\nI sincerely hope it doesn\u2019t turn out you were part of the stag party entertainment.

I'm not sure how he could claim he never checks the cameras while literally confronting you over something he saw on the cameras.", "WTF? He 'never' checks them, yet notices the SECOND a window is open? I think tf not. Tell the creep to piss off forever and all the guys defending his predatory bs can take a long walk off a short cliff.

I literally can't understand why anyone wouldnt tell you that...", "NTA!! Having live cameras while you are living in the space is disgusting and inappropriate. I have a pet cam and I sometimes need a cat sitter. The first thing I do is show them the camera and tell them to disconnect it while they are in the house.

He never really checks the cameras but just so happens to have the time/ motivation to do so while away on a bachelor's party trip, obviously knowing full well that his cat is being taken care of at home. Sure, I totally believe that. \n\nI'm also stunned by the sheer audacity of him harassing you about you opening the window (for a completley valid reason, might I add) when he saw you put the cat into a different room for safety reasons beforehand.

He lives in an apartment so there\u2019s obviously a rule about not opening the windows, however when I was cooking last night I set the fire alarm off. After I\u2019d put the cat in a separate room and closed the door, I opened one window in the kitchen to clear some of the smoke out. I then closed it and went to let his cat out again.\n\nAbout ten minutes later I look at my phone to a text message telling me to \u201cclose his window now!\u201d And a string of missed calls.\n\nI call him back assuming maybe his windows are sensored or something and explain that I\u2019d put the cat in the other room. He says he knows, he watched me do it. I ask what he\u2019s talking about and he says he has several nanny cameras rigged up for his cat when he\u2019s at work. I ask why the fuck he didn\u2019t tell me that and he said he didn\u2019t think it mattered, he never really checks them. I yelled at him that I\u2019d been walking around not totally dressed and asked if he\u2019d been watching. He flat out denied that and said I was being ridiculous.\n\nAt that point I\u2019m super annoyed and hang up - I\u2019d been in his flat for about four days totally alone, so had been walking around in my underwear quite a lot, and the first day I took my bra off in the living room because it was uncomfortable. This is all stuff I\u2019m wondering if he saw, or had access to.\n\nI grab my stuff, feed the cat and leave texting him that he can get someone else to look after his cat (I put keys in a lockbox he has for this reason), or come back from his trip.\n\nHe called me about a dozen times begging me to go back, and eventually had to get another friend to go in and look after his cat while he flew back from holiday. The men in our friend group are now annoyed at me (he was on a stag/ bachelor party), whereas the women are on my side.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now he is spying on you and having footage of you without your consent or knowledge. I would look into it if it is illegal where you live. You are totally NTA. And if he was just watching you when the alarm went off he probably was watching more times.", "Exactly this. As a cat owner myself, I've also put cameras up when being away for a long while. (I'm a hopeless mush and I miss them okay). \n\nWe ALWAYS inform our cat-sitter and the cameras are not hidden. They also are limited to 2 spots cats are a lot, so plenty of private area remain.

That is just flat out creepy.", "NTA. he was definitely watching you the whole time, the way he immediately got on you about the window proves that. i would have cleared out too. just because you\u2019re in his house doesn\u2019t mean he can spy on you.", "NTA - Go to the cops. \nThose sort of cameras give notification on movement in the room. \n\nI know, I have a camera in my place facing the front door, it is only on when I'm not home, but it gives me notifications of any movements and then I can view the screen or watch live.", "Your male friends are disgusting if they think not letting you know there were cameras was ok.

Not telling you about the cameras is beyond creepy and possibly illegal, depending on where you are. I would *definitely* get a lawyer and report that, to make sure the footage is deleted. Maybe that \"helps\" those male friends see the extent of that breach (probably not, if they don't get it in the first place).\n\nAlso calling you and yelling at you after he saw that you placed the cat in another room, is behaviour I would not want in a friendship. You acted responsibly, the cat wasn't in danger and he knew it.

If someone has cameras in their house, THEY SHOULD TELL YOU. You expect a level of privacy when you're in someone's house, especially when no one is there.", "NTA. I have cameras in my house that I turn on when I'm away so I can check on my cats. There's a lady that comes twice a day to feed them when that happens and she was told, before she even came, that there were cameras and when they were located.

He should have told you in advance if the cameras and where they are placed. I too have cameras in my house for my pet/burglars and anyone visiting my house knows about them let alone anyone staying at my house. They are motion sensored - the sensitivity can be adjusted so they are super sensitive to movement or barely sensitive, so when I'm home I have it set to record only where there is something very unusual - so only record when there is movement, as mentioned a little or a lot dependent on how I've set it. I barely ever look at it and half the time I forget to charge the cameras so they aren't even working. But the point is that even if he hardly uses them he should have told you (it might be that they were triggered by the alarm so he might actually not be lying). And the fact that he doubled down rather than apologising profusely makes him a huge ah. He must know what a huge invasion of privacy this was, even if his intentions were purely about ensuring the cat was safe.", "NTA If he never checks them how did he see you opening the window? If the footage is saved you should probably ask him to see that he is deleting the videos and if he refuses, threaten with legal consequences.
