He lives in an apartment so there\u2019s obviously a rule about not opening the windows, however when I was cooking last night I set the fire alarm off. After I\u2019d put the cat in a separate room and closed the door, I opened one window in the kitchen to clear some of the smoke out. I then closed it and went to let his cat out again.\n\nAbout ten minutes later I look at my phone to a text message telling me to \u201cclose his window now!\u201d And a string of missed calls.\n\nI call him back assuming maybe his windows are sensored or something and explain that I\u2019d put the cat in the other room. He says he knows, he watched me do it. I ask what he\u2019s talking about and he says he has several nanny cameras rigged up for his cat when he\u2019s at work. I ask why the fuck he didn\u2019t tell me that and he said he didn\u2019t think it mattered, he never really checks them. I yelled at him that I\u2019d been walking around not totally dressed and asked if he\u2019d been watching. He flat out denied that and said I was being ridiculous.\n\nAt that point I\u2019m super annoyed and hang up - I\u2019d been in his flat for about four days totally alone, so had been walking around in my underwear quite a lot, and the first day I took my bra off in the living room because it was uncomfortable. This is all stuff I\u2019m wondering if he saw, or had access to.\n\nI grab my stuff, feed the cat and leave texting him that he can get someone else to look after his cat (I put keys in a lockbox he has for this reason), or come back from his trip.\n\nHe called me about a dozen times begging me to go back, and eventually had to get another friend to go in and look after his cat while he flew back from holiday.

Your friend is, for obvious reasons.\n\nQuick edit: It's his right to set up cameras in the house to look what the cat's doing. But not telling you about it makes him TA. That's a breach of privacy then.", "NTA. He was watching you, hence the immediate texts and calls. Whp knowd how much he has watched you since you started catsitting. \n\nDisgusting. Cut him and his gross friends out of your life.", "NTA he should have told you they were there.", "NTA and your (non) \"friend\" is beyond creepy not to warn you about (or actually disconnect) the cameras that he spied on you with. And his \"I never really check them\" is obviously a lie because he knew immediately about you moving the cat and opening the window!\n\nEDIT: you might want to invoke criminal authority as you demand that he prove he's erased the footage. You don't even know if he shared it with his friends...", "NTA. Since he immediately noticed you opening the window, he was probably watching. He may have had a notification from the fire alarm going off, but more likely he has been watching periodically the whole time. Depending on location what he did was wrong or even illegal. Some places require you put up a sign saying there are cameras on the premises, even for private properties.", "NTA, huge creep here, run.", "NTA while he is in the right to set up nanny or security cameras in his home he should have told you they were there and probably where they were\n\nmy sister has a camera for her dog and it\u2019s sound activated to send a notification to her phone if she starts barking or getting worked up so if it\u2019s like that maybe the fire alarm alerted him so he opened the app then so he might not have been watching you through the cameras until it alerted him but like still obviously should\u2019ve told you about the cameras in the first place", "NTA. I do have cameras to watch my cats and house when I'm gone. But they are very obvious and I tell house sitters they are there because I don't want the house sitter to walk around in their underwear and get filmed. That's just common decency.", "NTA. I only have someone check in on my cat briefly every day I\u2019m gone to put out fresh food, leave some treats, and make sure the water fountain is working. My cat is skittish and skedaddles to his favorite hiding place whenever someone who is not me comes in the apartment. Regardless, I make sure anyone who enters my apartment knows that I have two cameras and their locations; which are at his favorite napping spots of course, and that the cameras don\u2019t record all the time, only when I open the app to check on my kitty.", "NTA. The fact that he called you, YELLING at you,  instead of having any faith that you took proper precautions about the cat before opening the window is just the icing on the cake.\n\nEdit: Come to think of it, if there was no sensor on the kitchen window, the idea that he just \u2018happened\u2019 to be watching the feed when you opened the window but wasn\u2019t watching any of the other feed seems far fetched. This may be why ALL the men are doubling down. Were they all watching, and know they\u2019ll be in deep doodoo if one of them cracks and tells the women?\n\nI sincerely hope it doesn\u2019t turn out you were part of the stag party entertainment. This may be reaching too far, but it might explain why they\u2019re ALL so adamant.", "NTA.\n\nI have a couple of cameras in my house to keep an eye on the cats when I'm away, and I would never have someone cat-sitting for me without telling them exactly where they are located.  \n\nI would also be pretty creeped out and concerned that he was indeed watching you.   I'm not sure how he could claim he never checks the cameras while literally confronting you over something he saw on the cameras.", "WTF? He 'never' checks them, yet notices the SECOND a window is open? I think tf not. Tell the creep to piss off forever and all the guys defending his predatory bs can take a long walk off a short cliff. NTA.\n\nI would be calling cops. They're useless but having paperwork comes in handy if any of your topless video ends up online.", "He says he almost never checks the cameras but just so happened to check them to yell at you about an open window... never told you about the nanny cams and he was at a multi day stag party... yeah, I don't believe his claim that he wasn't creeping on you... or his friends for that matter.\n\nDefinitely NTA", "I read the title and thought the cat was filming you \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA", "NTA - he clearly was watching whatever show was going on in the living room, if he was immediately aware of an open window.\n\nIt was entirely too creepy that he didn't tell you about the cameras .  \n\nThe men in this group are not your friends.  In the event something were to physically happen to you, I wouldn't count on them to be helpful bystanders to stop any assault.  They would be the men who would side with the attacker saying 'She was asking for it!' because in this instance they clearly said 'Ohhh she over reacted to the cameras'", "If he wasn't watching you how would he know about the windows as soon as it happened??\n\nHe was 100% watching and it's creepy and disgusting because he didn't mention it to you beforehand\n\nAny man who takes this person's side is not a man you should call a friend they don't respect you or your autonomy\n\nNTA but you need to re evaluate the male friends in this group", "NTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, so wrong not to inform you or disable them before leaving.", "NTA - your \u201cfriend\u201d was totally disrespectful towards you. He should have DEFINITELY tell you that he has cameras. I think you should end up this friendship for your own safety.", "Ummm this might be worth talking to a lawyer or police. He might have recorded you", "NTA. If he wasn\u2019t watching periodically how would he have known you opened a window or put the cat in another room? He\u2019s lying about not watching and he didn\u2019t tell you he could watch you while you were unaware you were being watched. What a words I can\u2019t say without being banned.", "NTA you're his friend, not someone he's worried will steal or some shit. If he doesn't check the cameras often then he genuinely might have forgotten, but him doubling down when you got upset is so so so skeevy. If I'd forgotten to tell you about cameras in my house while you were petsitting (god forbid), the only appropriate response would be, \"Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry, I didn't think about it. I'm erasing all the recent footage and-\"\n\nHang on. Wait no hang on, comment interrupted. Hang the fuck on.\n\nHe doesn't watch the cameras.... but he saw you open the window in real time??\n\nGirl.\n\nThere's like a 98% chance that this post is fictional but if it isn't then you have a WAY bigger problem on your hands than AITA is equipped to deal with. Get the women in your group to watch your back and explain in detail that your broski was voyeuring on you when he's supposed to be getting married.", "Nta that is creepy and you are right to not being comfortable  with him watching you", "100% NTA. I'm a guy and I would certainly have let you know about the cameras, and I can almost guarantee he saw you...", "NTA, this is terrible. I'd say don't delete any of the conversations you had. I hope that AH doesn't try to take revenge in any way. He actually stalked you, I'd go to the police and file a report", "NTA and possibly illegal depending on where you live because in many states in the USA you have a 2 party recording rule where the person being recorded has to know they're being recorded. Also even in the states where it's a single party rule there is a strict rule that you can't video record them in their underwear, nude or in the bathroom without their knowledge.", "NTA wow... I literally can't understand why anyone wouldnt tell you that...", "NTA!! Having live cameras while you are living in the space is disgusting and inappropriate. I have a pet cam and I sometimes need a cat sitter. The first thing I do is show them the camera and tell them to disconnect it while they are in the house. The camera is only for me to see my pets while they are alone, I want the cat sitter to feel safe in my home so I'm always clear that they should completely turn it off while they are in the house.", "Ah yes of course. He never really checks the cameras but just so happens to have the time/ motivation to do so while away on a bachelor's party trip, obviously knowing full well that his cat is being taken care of at home. Sure, I totally believe that. \n\nI'm also stunned by the sheer audacity of him harassing you about you opening the window (for a completley valid reason, might I add) when he saw you put the cat into a different room for safety reasons beforehand. Bold, and not in a good way.\n\nYou're very clearly NTA, OP. \n\nDepending on where you are located, what your 'friend' did might be full on illegal. I'd recommend at the very, very least staying far away from him in the future. \nI'm sorry this happened to you. Good luck on your path forward!", "NTA. He\u2019s been checking them. I\u2019m sorry to say. If he hadn\u2019t he wouldn\u2019t have known about the window. I\u2019m sorry this has happened, because it\u2019s such an invasion of privacy. Definitely NOT TA.", "NTA.  Call a lawyer and report this to the police.  This sounds a lot like voyeurism imo.", "Oh so NTA! We had a camera inside for a bit and had a neighbour coming to water our plants. I made sure to let them know where the camera was and the types of alerts we would get! Such an invasion of privacy otherwise!", "Two judgements, one for your friend, one for you, and I am going to leave gender out of this.\n\nFor the OP, NTA, your doing him a favour, even if he pays you, your still doing him a favour, and taking time from what your doing.\n\nFor your Friend, for having the cameras set up NTA and being an attentive pet owner.  He is however the TA for not telling you about them, he should of told you about them from the get go.  There should of also been a safe space for you to get changed, to sleep and to chill.\n\nI dont care what sex you are, we have an entitlement of privacy, and this was not respected, and I would of done the exact same, or I would of told him, I want to know the locations of the camera's and I want access to the cloud account.", "That is creepy. NTA.", "Absolutely 100% NTA. Calling you ridiculous for asking if he saw you is gaslighting. Sorry to say but of course he saw.", "NTA. Screw that guy, and any of the dudes who are mad. Not OK.", "NTA - that was so intrusive, invasive, ILLEGAL! Wow... you know he was watching you and who knows who he shared the videos with. I would be pissed as hell.", "NTA. You fed the cat and made contact with him to let him know he needed to return and that the cat no longer had care. (It\u2019s not the cat\u2019s fault the human is an AH.)\n\nRe: the \u201cfriend\u201d: he was 100% spying on you. Ew. Like criminally ew. Maybe find new friends for the ones who are on his side.", "NTA. He failed to disclose the not insignificant fact that you were being constantly filmed. That's illegal. Him saying that he wasn't watching you is blowing smoke up your arse because he knew THE MOMENT you opened the window. You did the right thing leaving.", "NTA. Talk to someone else in the friend group and find out if your walking around was part of their entertainment. Weird that he randomly checked when just when you opened a window. Much more likely he was watching all the time.", "NTA. Honestly I would see a lawyer. What if he has recordings?", "NTA. A lot of people feel uncomfortable with in house cameras. Even if he had no intention of perving on you he deliberately omitted the fact that he had those cameras cause he knew you'd probably decline to cat sit. Your guy friends can do one.", "NTA He should have told you there were cameras.", "NTA. Fuck that.", "NTA. They should have let you know. It is a complete violation of your privacy. Completely awful that a friend would do this and that anyone would defend these actions.\n\nBecause some people aren't aware, many (unsure if it's all) cameras will show with a big red light when you use your front (selfie) camera and you have it in view.", "NTA he filmed you without consent, most civilized places That\u2019s a Crime.", "No, no, you are NTA. \n\nI think it's odd to roam about someone else's home in your skivvies or the buff, but if he did notice you frolicking around, I hope he was trying to spare you both the embarrassment. \n\nBut the call regarding the window and the fire. If the alarms aren't connected, I just don't expect people to be decent much anymore, you know?", "NTA. Hope he's your ex-friend now, that's downright creepy and not okay.", "NTA\n\nHe should have informed you about the cameras he had installed\n\nHe sounds like a creep and stalker, he has probably been watching you a lot while you were in his apartment", "Nta. But question: How is it \"obvious\" that you cannot open the windows because it's a flat? There's no connection between the two things.", "NTA", "yuck, your privacy has been violated, and oh geez 'he just forgot to tell you', he is a creep, ask him to delete the data from when you were there, in front of you, and you'll find out if he is really a true friend", "NTA. \n\nI have been in this exact situation while dog sitting and I was furious. My friend let me(F) and my gf walk around in our underwear while house/dog sitting knowing she had secret cameras all over the house that her bf had access to.

I suggest you do the same with this creep.", "HITA", "NTA / Possibly NAH\n\nHe should've told you about the cameras, but who knows if it was intentional or not? Hard to say if he's an asshole; we don't know his intentions.
