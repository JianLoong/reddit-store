It took two or three times saying no, but he gave up pretty quickly and went and passed out on the other couch. I didn't really sleep much the rest of the night.\n\nAt the time, I was really shocked. I remember thinking that Cathy and the three young (under 10) kids were asleep like 50 feet away (think small ranch with an addition off the kitchen going into the backyard).\n\nAbout 6 or so years later (9 years ago), I was visiting home and on a certain dating app as one does.

He never knew it was me that he had been talking to.***\n\nSince that time, I have been really avoidant of Cathy and her family.

She didn't tell me why, but Valerie knows me a little too well and caught that I wasn't surprised when she mentioned the pending divorce. She pushed me and eventually I told her what happened 15 years ago.\n\nValerie's now pushing for me to tell Cathy as supporting information for the divorce case. I really don't want Cathy to know that I've held this secret all these years. I've asked Valerie to hold this secret for now, and said I would come forward if the divorce got ugly. It's definitely unfair to Valerie because she and Cathy have grown up like sisters (they're actually cousins) and have been close their whole lives.\n\nAITA?\n\nSome relevant facts to the story:\n\n* Cathy's not actually my aunt...she's my parent's 1st cousin.

Family in general was not particularly accepting, so there weren't many out LGBTQ+ people in the family circle.\n* For that night 15 years ago, my cousin Emily (not Cathy and Mark's daughter) were driving from Boston to Florida the next morning.

This is about the power someone has over a family member they helped raise. You saw him as an Uncle, correct? You called him Uncle, you loved him as such?

At 18, the relationship hasn't magically transformed from 'parental/authority in lieu of parent' to 'equals'. It's still a much more than grey area, even if perhaps not completely black and white.\n\nTo add to that, he did not come to you as an equal, to discuss feelings, attraction, or even his own struggle with his sexuality.

You're still paying the price and in some ways, trying to protect him. I recognize that that is partially because you've been fighting a hard fight against prejudice and homophobia yourself, but I do encourage you to examine things and check whether any of it could also be because of grooming behavior by him prior to an attempt to get a 'payout'. Something to talk about with your therapist, definitely - just, please don't keep paying a price that should never have fallen on you.
