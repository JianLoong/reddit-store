I was sleeping on the couch in the family room. I woke up at some point in the night to a very drunk uncle Mark (age 47) rubbing my leg and propositioning me. It took two or three times saying no, but he gave up pretty quickly and went and passed out on the other couch. I didn't really sleep much the rest of the night.\n\nAt the time, I was really shocked. I remember thinking that Cathy and the three young (under 10) kids were asleep like 50 feet away (think small ranch with an addition off the kitchen going into the backyard).\n\nAbout 6 or so years later (9 years ago), I was visiting home and on a certain dating app as one does. I got a message from a blank profile. Asked for a pic and got a picture of Mark (just his face) back. I immediately blocked him.\n\nSince that time, I have been really avoidant of Cathy and her family. After spending a large amount of my childhood at her house, I have been back less than two dozen times in 15 years. I've always felt guilty for not saying anything. I justified it to myself that I didn't want to blow up the family for my young cousins. After they've grown, I told myself that it's been too long to say anything.\n\nI was on the phone the other day with my aunt Valerie who told me Cathy and Mark were separating. She didn't tell me why, but Valerie knows me a little too well and caught that I wasn't surprised when she mentioned the pending divorce. She pushed me and eventually I told her what happened 15 years ago. \n\nValerie's now pushing for me to tell Cathy as supporting information for the divorce case. I really don't want Cathy to know that I've held this secret all these years. I've asked Valerie to hold this secret for now, and said I would come forward if the divorce got ugly. It's definitely unfair to Valerie because she and Cathy have grown up like sisters (they're actually cousins) and have been close their whole lives.\n\nAITA?\n\nSome relevant facts to the story:\n\n* Cathy's not actually my aunt...she's my parent's 1st cousin. Just that generation all grew up in the same neighborhood, so they're all really close like siblings. \n* I'm gay and have been out since I was 15. I was one of two people out in my family. Family in general was not particularly accepting, so there weren't many out LGBTQ+ people in the family circle.\n* For that night 15 years ago, my cousin Emily (not Cathy and Mark's daughter) were driving from Boston to Florida the next morning. We were just spending one night at Cathy and Mark's. \n* Names changed for privacy.\n* Throwaway account.", "created_utc": 1674571474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k71st/aita_for_not_telling_my_aunt_her_husband_is_gay/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
