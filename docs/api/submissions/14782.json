Then listen quietly and patiently, and instead of rebuttals and arguments simply ask more questions. There might be something deeper from your moms past at play here you aren\u2019t aware of, and it\u2019s a chance to build a better relationship instead of causing a rift. \n\nAsking questions is an amazing way to bridge gaps and heal hurts.", "NTA. Your mom sounds controlling in this case, and the fact that it took other adults in your life to point out her behavior because you didn\u2019t notice it concerns me. \n\nYou are 18 and can do what you want.", "NTA Understand, though, that your mom\u2019s iron fist over your spending is controlling and abnormal, and your rational response to her irrational mindset probably won\u2019t go over well.", "You work, you earn the money being spent, you are 18.... i am at a loss as to how or why your mom thinks she has any power over what you buy. Its a book not a bag of meth", "NTA - You\u2019re right, you\u2019re an adult and do not need your mother\u2019s permission to make purchases. She sounds overly controlling and like she has confused your perception of what normal parent/child boundaries look like.\n\nYou sound very responsible, and it makes sense to get something for yourself every now and again. This wasn\u2019t even a very expensive item or anything. Many budgeting advice recommends keeping 50% for needs, 30% put into savings, and 20% for fun money. You\u2019re allowed to adjust those numbers however you see fit, but the point is that you have a balance, and only *you* are allowed to set those limits and find the balance that works best for you.", "Did you miss a 0 there or is this really about 25$?\nAt 18 you're not really fully an adult, and it makes sense for parents to still try and teach their children to be responsible with money.

You are not in the wrong for spending your own money on something you want. I'm very similar to you, I love reading, I hoard my money, but every now and then a special edition calls for me. I've spent $120 on a limited edition board game as well as a few hundred total on various limited and special edition books/signed books. \n\nYou are allowed to purchase things.

I'm sorry to tell you this, but your mum sounds super controlling.

Let her know you feel she has done well raising you and that you need her to trust that. You sound like a good kid, so keep that in mind. Also ungrateful AH's rarely worry that they will sound like ungrateful AH's.", "NTA. You are an adult, and your mom is in for a real wakeup call regarding how much she can still control you. \n\nYou could light your money on fire in front of her, and you'd still be in the right, as it is your money and you're an adult.\n\nAlso, seriously, I thought this was going to be about something really expensive.

Although if I might offer some unsolicited advice, maybe make a simple budget spreadsheet to show your parents? You are legally an adult, but understandably still learning/developing and this likely comes from a place of concern. Showing them your thoughtful money planning could go a long way towards them seeing you as more of an adult and maybe avoid future conflicts.", "NTA. maybe this is a fear of you growing up thing.\n\nWhen I was first year uni I waited for a year for a half price sale for a copy of this massive neuroscience textbook.

She opens my mail. Idc. It comes to her house she can open it", "Where op is at that time is not completely over. Also, I am 19 and my mother stills helps provide for me because I am her child and sometimes I need help. Just because you're an adult doesn't mean your parents have to stop helping you. It just means you more freedom and responsibilities.", "I love my mother and respect her and am extremely grateful. I listen to my mother and am called a respectful and responsible child by every adult I know. You can't say I feel a certain way when I provided no evidence of that. It's literally child abuse to not provide for a kid. I do NOT want my mom to keep paying for me even if she offers when im older cause she is my mother and I would be independent and she has done enough. This is over a $25 book not a 250000 house. I'm surprised you have garnered such rude and astounding beliefs about me over saying the law requires her to provide for me cause it does. She has to feed and clothe me due to law. I am grateful she does extra and doesn't abuse me but I simply want some control over the money I make. If you must know I already spoke to her and worked it out in a kind way where she called me respectful and trustworthy and knows im grateful that ended with us both saying I love you. But sure, make your assumptions about me and my relationship with my mother when my friends all envy how healthy it is when we discuss our parents and the fact my mother herself said it made her day that I trusted her enough to tell her and was so happy. So sure. Say what you will, I at least know my relationship is good with her", "She's actually an adult. Not a pretend one. When you're financially independent, then you get an opinion.", "Uh huh.", "The world is going to be harsh when you realize all the little delusions you've been living under aren't actually true. Santa Claus is also not real.", "Maybe her mother is tired of her spending money on frivolities and is ABOUT to ask her to start paying for her phone.", "Just block them they are harassing you look at there post history they gaslight everyone.there just a jerk NTA btw. Sorry there harassing you.", "You keep bring up the law about how she can't make you pay rent, I showed you an example how my mother broke federal law by opening my mail. The police said well you are 18 and she can kick you out. Thankfully our parents love us, the rest of the world DOES NOT.\n\nI think you should be able to buy the 25 dollar book. Throwing around the \"I am 18\" so I will do whatever I want should come with consequences in my opinion. You want to be an adult so bad, act like one.", "You  spoke about your mom's care for you as simply an obligation and a child must never forget all the other stuff their parents did for them. I don't wanna take and analyze your sentences one by one, but one could see at which points you implied such things.\n\nI said from the beginning this is not about the $25, but only advised against you saying (I quote): \"I Can Buy What I Want\" or \"I am an adult and it's my money\", at least not WHILE you're still using her money as well.\n\nI'm glad you worked things out with your mom and can only imagine you weren't quoting the law or saying she's obligated to house you and all while you spoke to her.", "I am financially independent based on what my STATE LAW allows again, its literally illegal to charge me rent here.", "I'm well aware thanks! I've been playing Santa Claus for my sis since I was twelve <3 its not a delusion I literally had a friend get in trouble cause she tried once she turned 18", "Maybe she's ABOUT to tell her to find a new house.\nYeah, we're not her to judge on suppositions. Move on.", "I don't spend money on frivolites as my average spending a month is <10$!!", "Rent and mail are two different things. One is me paying her for something considered a need and the other is an envelope. I don't want to say the I can do whatever I want cause that's just ungrateful I just want some control over spending money I make. I already spoke to her anyways and it went fine. She was happy I talked to her and it was very respectful.", "Because it is im obligation in a way. I don't see it as one and am extremely grateful for it but technically it is in a way and she does a wonderful job of it. Children need a lot to grow, I mean if someone abuses their child we look down on them cause its wrong, a child has a right to be loved and cares for by there parents. This is my money im using for the book, not hers. I would never use hers as its hers unless she wanted to get me a gift or something. I only use the money I make and in my account. Of course I wouldnt quote all that at her she's my mom. I just explained how and why I got it and how I felt not being im control of it expenses. That's it. I feel we have strayed from the original point. But, overall I am grateful for my mother and love her, just wanting some independence with my spending money. Have a nice day :)", "NTA. Get your own bank account & have your books delivered to your work. Mom is controlling.", "Since you've recently turned 18, are your accounts exclusively in your name? If not, change this as soon as possible. If she felt lambasting you for a $25 purchase was acceptable, she may decide removing your money to prevent you from being irresponsible would be best, then you'll have no access or information about the account balances and would have to ask mommy for every cent. NTA", "exactly, you're not in the wrong but if you use the 'I'll buy what i like' all that will happen is more fighting. you need to find out why she's so flipped out over this.", "The fact that you waited until it was on sale at such a low price before you bought it, says a lot about your self control with regards spending. It\u2019s also something that can be cherished long term and passed on to others, possibly your own kids if you so choose. You can spend $25 on literally anything that lasts 5mins now, but this isn\u2019t that. \n\nYou\u2019re obviously very conscious about how and what you spend your money on and personally, if this was my daughter I would commend them in doing so, instead of reprimanding them. \n\nAlso you\u2019re an adult and the decision to spend the money you earned on what you like is totally yours. I can appreciate your mothers concern as a parent myself, but it seems to be a bit overbearing here, as it\u2019s not an excessive amount, neither is it something of little value. \n\nI think there may be something more to this and you need to have an honest chat about what her fears may be.", "Do not confront your parents (if that's your plan) before you ensure they do not have access to your money."]}
