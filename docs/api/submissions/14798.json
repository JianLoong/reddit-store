Remind her (it shouldn\u2018t be necessary though) that you don\u2019t wear one for a whim and that this is the one thing that is not negotiable.

Your friends fiance isn't going to change, he's going to be bigoted against you and try and either make you a Christian or pish you out of your friends life. Sorry", "You literally guaranteed they got the venue they wanted and this is how they're treating you? \n\nPersonally I'd be going straight back to the owner and saying \"you know what, I'm not sure such bigoted people should have access to such a nice venue\"", "NTA. Also, be prepared because there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll \u201callow\u201d her to continue being your friend after the wedding. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Honestly, I doubt she\u2019ll be even a shadow of the friend you\u2019ve known after a few years of marriage.", "You have taken no action to cause anyone pain or hurt, so just know that. \n\nThey are asking to you take an action, and it's unreasonable.\n\nI am making a wild hopeful assumption, but I'd like to think deep down her reaction is partially because she knows this is messed up.", "you need to stop thinking like this!!!  YOU ARE NTA!! she is. you didn\u2019t do anything to her. she did this to you and herself!!!\n\n\nedit to add.   brian is the biggest AH.  his wife is crying about this and still he won\u2019t budge!! wth!! and to blame you and say that you are choosing something material over your friend.   this is about your beliefs.  not an accessory!!!\n\n\nwhy would you wearing a headscarf be a problem for his religion anyway?", "Think about that. You simply stating that wearing your head covering is important to you is too much for this long time friend to respect. She didn\u2019t hesitate to hurt you, to disrespect your beliefs, disrespect you. She doesn\u2019t just want you to not wear your head covering. She doesn\u2019t want you to wear your head covering so the bigot she is marrying & his family of bigots won\u2019t think she associates outside their faith. She wants to hide who you are so she\u2019ll look better. She isn\u2019t thinking of your feelings when she is trying to strip you of your identity so you won\u2019t shame her in from of the new bigoted family. And she is embracing their bigotry.", "You are not hurting her. You have made it clear she is hurting you, and she needs to make a decision. Stand up for you or cave to her bigoted fianc\u00e9. I am sure she is inconsolable because she is realizing doing the right thing will cost likely cost her the marriage.", "If he's that uncomfortable with your faith and how you show it, I imagine this will not be the last time you'll be asked to hide your faith.", "The new husband will probably not allow his new wife to socialize with you. If you, wearing a head covering, is somehow offensive at their wedding, you will not be more palatable after the ceremony. I'm sorry you are losing your friend.", "There is nothing in Christian teaching that forbids women from covering their hair- in fact in many situations it used to be required or encouraged. Just look at nuns. \n\nThis has nothing to do with religion. They are bigots/racists. And I\u2019m sorry.", "She's probably struggling to face the fact that she's marrying a bigot. It's likely she realizes it and is trying to still make the relationship work. But it can't work if she wants to keep being friends with people of different backgrounds and faiths. Either all her friends will leave her or she will have to leave her fiance. There's no happy ending here for a girl with a Muslim best friend marrying a bigot.", "You\u2019re not hurting her. She\u2019s hurting you and is feeling upset because that has consequences. You\u2019re just existing as yourself, she\u2019s the one making demands. There\u2019s a difference.", "You should say that to her. And ask her if it's so important that you be there, why is Brian insisting that you do something you can't?", "And Indian Hindu women when in a temple", "I recently had to wear a head scarf at a Catholic wedding mass. A new cathedral opened and to show respect, the Catholic bride requested the women to cover their heads. Took me back to my Catholic childhood days.\n\nOp should just tell her friend and her groom together that this request is unacceptable and she is offended that the groom is making this into a big deal.", "Christians are also supposed to cover their heads in a holy space and during religious rituals. The bigots don't even understand their own religion and are only being bigots.", "*tenet", "Is that why I\u2019ve seen people wear white head coverings in Christian faiths while going through confirmation?", "Listen to me. I'm an atheist. And your \"friend\" is being an asshole.\n\nShe isn't respecting your religion, and Brian is trying to paint you as the bad guy. You aren't.\n\nYou aren't the one causing a problem. He is. You aren't the reason your friend is inconsolable. He is.\n\nHave a talk with your friend in private about how his demands are absurd and controlling. That he's purposefully sabotaging your friendship... and that she needs to make a decision, if she will be a woman controlled by her husband or not.\n\nI wish you luck... you sound like an amazing person.", "Ah, apologies, missed that it wasn\u2019t in a church any longer.", "> who are you say that she doesn\u2019t follow these rules?\n\nNone of them do. People have been picking and choosing which of their \"deeply held religious beliefs\" they want to follow since the dawn of time. They're all fake and they're all TA.", "You know likely better than most that an important part of interfaith marriages is a healthy respectful for other\u2019s beliefs.\n\nBrian has demonstrated that he does not have that respect, so it\u2019s safe to assume he expects his wife to begin holding the same beliefs as he does.\n\nEven beyond the wedding, how do you see your friendship going as she adopts his beliefs more and more. Whether she truly believes them or is just appeasing her husband it is going to have a massive impact on how she behaves towards you.\n\nNTA.", "Ok:  that is flat on islamaphobia.  Ok.  Either:\n\n -  Figure if it's Brian or if he's carrying water for Kate (from Kate).  If he's a good guy and stuck between a rock and a hard place you all can have a real heart to heart conversation and work something out.\n\n - If Brian himself is cagey or weird, you need to ask Kate if this is a relationship she wants to maintain.  People change over time.  Especially when married to someone pulling them some way.  You only get to figure out the anchors people are rooted under stressful situations.  Kate seems to be in your corner so be gentle here.\n\n - Everybody was masking and Kate really wasn't your friend.  This is the worst of the options but really you have to ask your friend and this is the best time.  It'll suck but you won't have to suffer a day of discrimination and bigotry.\n\nMy previous \"life hacks\" of head coverings still stands.  I might be reading too much into this but maybe Kate sort of negotiated this as being a Sheitel or something (hence the ask for a wig).  Gaaah bigoted family get togethers are impossibly hard and still NTA.", "And is lost now to the evangelical swamp.", "There\u2019s no hate like religious love!", "Bigots gotta bigot! Love that and stealing for future use.", "Or if OP had demanded Kate cover her hair for OP's wedding.", "\ud83c\udfafOP should also remind her that she went out of her way to help secure the lovely church, from a *friend* who owns the building. \n\nWhere were they going to go if the venue wasn\u2019t available?

Sweetheart, I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. I\u2019d sit this one out, and send a nice gift.", "It's just plain bigotry against Muslims and ignorance. There isn't a whole lot of reasoning when a lot of Evangelicals control what thier wives and daughters wear like no pants or hair must be long etc. It's not a choice you see, God told them it has to be that way.", "Not all of us. I feel Brian is wrong and OP should wear her hair covering.", "I guess you missed the part about Isis cutting peoples heads off.", "Literally the absolute worst.", "came to say this! I wouldn't even be in a relationship with someone if they were so judgemental of a friend, let alone my best friend!", "Will there be no women in hats? Once upon a time women wearing hats was a thing, and they most definitely wore them to church. Is the groom going to tackle any little old lady who dares to wear a hat to their wedding?", "Yeah, the \"rule\" only exists for OP- that's bigotry.", "You buy the building just like a house. I have seen a number of churches people have purchased and converted into a home.", "Every building in the US is owned by someone. In large denominations, it\u2019s the church organization that owns it. But there are a huge number of independent single churches that are either owned by their congregation or the pastor directly. I had an event in a town near me recently that was in a massive, historic church. But the church institution had sold it years ago and it was literally up for sale at the time we had the event. Just some old dude that brought up properties all over the city, owned it and let people use it as a community space.", "And her shame at her own choice to back him instead of her friend.", "Absolutely this.  He\u2019s already telling her loud and clear that you\u2019re not welcome around him and his family.", "Thank you! I am not seeing enough people point out that Kate is also being selfish. \n\nShe is choosing the power and privilege that come from being a partnered woman in the Evangelical Christian Church over what is moral and correct regarding her friend's faith. \n\nShe does not want to be known in her church as the woman who defied her husband on the first day of their union to defend a Muslim.", "But even if it *was* a church still, there wouldn\u2019t be restrictions on wearing a head covering.", "So how does her choosing her religion that she take seriously make her fake? If anything her friend expecting her to hide away her religion is the fake one.", "That\u2019s not really the same thing though. You\u2019re not violating Kate\u2019s religion by asking her to cover her hair\u2026.", "Spanish. Inquisition. \n\nSalem witch trials. \n\nThe holocaust. \n\nBad people will find reasons in any religion to do bad things. It's not the religion. It's the people finding reasons to be hateful is the problem.", "I haven\u2019t ever known anyone in ISIS. If I had then the statement would be different", "Isis has killed more Muslims than any other religious group. Muslims hate terrorism as much as any other religion.", "I wonder if the fiance's family knows what nuns wear? Bunch of sluts flaunting their wimples!\n\n/s and yes I did have to look up what a wimple was and when I learned the real name I had to commit to the pun.", "Please talk to the Church owner!! His family are bigots and also don\u2019t know the Bible well because the Bible endorses women wearing head coverings. The man who owns the building deserves to know the type of people who will be using it. 1 Corinthians 11:2-10 makes it a requirement for women who teach but head coverings were considered a part of modest dress Genesis 24:65. Your friend is a giving her tacit approval to a bigot and he\u2019s also an idiot since they don\u2019t know what the Bible actually teaches.", "OK, now it makes sense to me. I didn't really expect you to respond, so thanks!\n\nIt's also interesting in that some religions don't allow weddings outside of their official, active churches. Maybe groom's religion allows it. Or MAYBE he's not as devoted to his faith when it benefits HIM!", "Would it be too much to say something like this? \"thank you for your help in securing this venue for the wedding. Unfortunately due to a change of plans I won't be attending the wedding as the groom is uncomfortable with me wearing a headscarf at his wedding. I appreciate your help and I look forward to crossing paths with you in the future.\"\n\nEither way I'm sorry this happened to you. Your friend is lacking a backbone and the groom's request is seriously messed up and ignorant.", "There is no point in asking the building owner about this. The issue is with the bigoted groom, his family, and the bride who won't stand up against the bigotry. Bringing the landlord into this won't address the issue.\n\nNTA. They don't respect your autonomy, you offered a solution, not attending, and they don't respect that either.", "DO IT", "This may not be that relevant, but I'm wondering, has the church been deconsecrated?  Surely the hardcore evangelical christians wouldn't want to have a wedding in a church that has been de-god-ified?", "Not only homes, in UK I\u2019ve noticed they turned some churches into grocery stores and even nightclubs. I haven\u2019t been yet but I\u2019d be curious to see them from inside", "I wonder if these nuns climb trees and scrape their knees, tear their dresses, have curlers in their hair or sing in the abbey! \n\n...sorry but the word 'wimple' somehow got 'How do you solve a problem like Maria' stuck in my head and I couldn't resist!", "Well to a lot of Evangelicals, Catholics aren\u2019t Christians so there\u2019s that.", "\"*Your friend is a giving her tacit approval to a bigot and he\u2019s also an idiot since they don\u2019t know what the Bible actually teaches.*\"  Sounds like most Christians I know.", "I actually think a different route as did Jesus not welcome all of different faiths to preach the word of god? I\u2019m not religious at all so I may be off base here.", "That\u2019s brilliantly put and I hope OP uses it!", "I think it's passive aggressive.\n\nI would separate the two and make it just asking for advice on how to navigate the situation.", "I mean Catholicism is a branch of Christianity, unless this was some tongue in check comment about how they are bad christians?", "Right! I suspect Brian and his family would be shocked (and possibly horrified?) to learn that the Bible was written by Jews, about Jews and for Jews! Lots of brown folks and brown women who wore headscarves! Headscarves were (and still) are the height of modesty in the Bible.", "No. Legitimately, a lot of Evangelicals believe Catholics are not Christian. It's a bonkers belief, but it's fairly common", "Wait \u2018til they find out Jesus was Jewish. They\u2019ll lose their minds!", "Yeah, never looked too much into that brand of crazy I guess. I'm just a recovering Catholic, hence my confusion.", "In the verrrry olden days (like 1600s) catholics actually faced religious persecution in Europe.
