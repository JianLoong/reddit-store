Religious customs are not \u2018material\u2019 (to use Brian\u2019s word). It\u2019s part of who you are, just like his family\u2019s customs are part of who they are. Would he ask them to give up their religious customs to make Kate\u2019s family more comfortable?", "You didn't make her inconsolable. Brian did. NTA.", "If she was any kind oi friend she would respect your religion. If she goes with this rule now there's no telling what else her fianc\u00e9/husband will set for her that she will go along with.", "What Brian is doing sounds like discrimination and the fact that the friend is going along with it is a giant red flag. Even if they back off this request I would probably still skip the wedding if I was OP", "Also, if Brian had any feelings for his soon to be wife, he'd find a way to accommodate your faith, as well.", "I know at the very least, the owner of the church would be upset by it, since I know him personally. I've considered asking him how to navigate this but I don't want to make things worse with Kate or Brian.", "That's an excellent point re: covering the hair in Church!", "Orthodox Greek women cover their heads, as do many Jewish sects. It's not just Muslims. It started as a fashion forwarded by Roman elite women who covered their heads, then traveled to Byzantium as the empire expanded. In an effort to be fashionable, all kinds of women started doing it as well. But then during the Medieval period, patriarchy kicked in and it became a religious tenant for many religions. Until the second Vatican council, Catholic women were expected to cover their heads and that was in the 1960s.", "Thank you. I think I just feel so lost because I never expected this from her, and I'd never even think of asking this of her if our situations were reversed. She's been my friend for so long, I don't want to hurt her, and I know that I did, but I also don't know that I can get over this.", "Some companies will even offer options for getting a large enough wrap or the fabric for one so that a matching hijab can be worn! It\u2019s 2023 and they need to realize that their Islamophobia isn\u2019t going to be accepted, let alone catered to.", "Or if OP demanded that Brian wear a religious garment. Imagine the scandal!", "I agree with you!\n\nBut I really don't like the addition of the word \"thingy\" to headscarf...", "I feel for Kate too. It sounds as if she's trying to figure out how to get around fiance's douchebaggery so that her good friend can stand with her in her rightful place. But she should have shut this down as soon as it cropped up.\n\nI hope that the bride and groom share exactly the same religious beliefs, because he's made it clear how intolerant of others' beliefs he is. \n\nHeaven forbid that he's Roman Catholic (for example) and his new wife is Lutheran (or any other church that's not RC)! I wonder if they've had premarital counseling with the church or otherwise.", "My husband and I actually had our ceremony in a non religious location because we didn't want to impose anything on anyone that they weren't comfortable with. Even if we had a religious ceremony though, I wouldn't have asked her to cover up.", "Yeah, Brian and his family are Christians. I'm Muslim but my husband is Jewish actually. I've always found it beautiful how different people's faiths can be, and yet have so many similarities at the same time. I'll never understand people's insistence on being so blind to what others hold dear to themselves.", "They're evangelical Christians and I'm Muslim, Kate was previously not very religious at all until after she met Brian.", "The scarf is apart of her religious beliefs. Why should she have to change for some jerks she will never see again? \nJust because they are important in your life doesn\u2019t mean that they get to make any decisions for you involving your personal beliefs. How would you feel if you was told you couldn\u2019t wear something you have wore everyday since you have known this person and that person knew exactly why you wear it?  Just because you believe it is made up doesn\u2019t mean crap and like she said it covers her hair ( we don\u2019t know her religious background and the rules involving her scarf so a little showing may be appropriate) so the friend is an asshole not OP!", "who are you say that she doesn\u2019t follow these rules? Her deciding the not attend the wedding in favor of keeping her headscarf on for one day should prove enough she takes her religion seriously. You said ESH but it seems like the comment was mostly targeted towards op and not the friend and husband. The friend should\u2019ve known how important ops religion was to even ask that.", "They\u2019ve had no issues making it worse for you.  They asked (and that was already inappropriate and bigoted) and now they\u2019re repeatedly attempted to make you feel like a bad person when they are (yes including Kate - appeasing a bigot makes you a bigot)", "I don't know where you live, so there's probably something I'm not getting.\n\nIs this church not owned by the parish or the greater church? Does the wedding officiant not work with the owner?\n\nAnyway, maybe I'm horrible or a crazy risk taker, but if I were facing a situation like yours--dropping out of the wedding and possibly losing a good friend due to her fiance's malice--I would have a friendly conversation with the owner stating the scenario and asking for their thoughts. Also, I'd explain the groom's request without insulting him and as calmly as possible. At this point, what else could go wrong? Right now, is there any step that you could take to make this all better? It seems not. If the groom and his family are outliers from their church in their odious beliefs, then maybe the priest/pastor/rabbi could speak with them and they'll be better people for it.\n\nIf their entire congregation are AHs like groom, though, you'll know for certain that the worst has come to pass \n\nI really hope that something can be done or that your friend will ditch him.", "It's a difficult one, you want to resolve the issue but you don't want them thinking that you're going behind their back. Sorry that you have to face this bigotry, good luck", "How is asking for help navigating this stressful and unnecessary situation going to make it worse? I say bringing it up to him is a great idea.", "It's not you that is hurting her, it's her bigoted fianc\u00e9.", "I agree with the other comment. You have done nothing to hurt your friend. Your friend is unfortunately marrying a bigot and her decision to accommodate his bigotry is hurting your friendship. I am so sorry you have been put in this extremely uncomfortable situation.", "I know there's a couple different terms for different kind of headscarves so I kinda tried to cast a wide net- admittedly that's probably not the best way I could've phrased it. \n\nI didn't want anyone to get irritated if they thought I was implying the wrong kinda one- because I don't know the difference.", "It seems like a lot of religious stuff hasn\u2019t been discussed yet and needs to be asap", "Exactly. And she can\u2019t do the same for you?\n\nThat\u2019s a selfish friend. NTA", "Shes not your friend if shes siding with her bigoted fiance. Shes backing racism. Take a hard look at ur interactions with this person. Make her aware thats whats shes doing.  I mean would they make someone who is jewish take off their Yamaka?", "Have Kate read this thread and maybe she\u2019ll realize that she\u2019s enabling bigots and Islamaphobes.  They\u2019re the AH, and so is she as long as she sides with them.  NTA", "I\u2019m sorry for you because she\u2019s allowed a man to override her morals.  Even if you were to abide by his bigoted wishes, he would make sure she couldn\u2019t be friends with you after the wedding.", "She sounds like she has the values and fortitude of wet clay.", "The building was sold by the parish a few years back and the new owner restored it on his own. It's mostly just been maintained as a historical building but he allows people to have occasional ceremonies there as well.\n\nMy husband is suggesting I talk to him about it too but I'm still on the fence about it.", "I get your point! There are a lot of names and different types of accessories/gear. It's just that OP already provided us with a nice, generic term! I follow the lead of anyone whose traditions are outside my knowledge. Or try to! LOL", "I wish I knew where this is happening and the faith of the groom and bride, to get a better understanding. But that info plays no part in the judgment OP came here for. \n\nIf the couple hasn't discussed all this and made decisions, everything could go out the window as soon as she gets pregnant with their first child!"]}
