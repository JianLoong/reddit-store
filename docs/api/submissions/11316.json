What was their plan? Just hope you showed up?", "NTA - i don\u2019t understand these types of parties. Make someone feel like crap all day and then come home\nto a surprise party that they are not in the mood for.", "NTA.  They played the \"surprise party\" game really poorly.", "They like surprises so much, well they got one. NTA\n\nAnd now, soapbox time. This tv show trope of pretending to forget someone\u2019s birthday and ignoring them in order to surprise them later isn\u2019t cute or funny. It\u2019s abusive. Deliberately making your loved one feel bad is a terrible thing to do. Believe it or not, it\u2019s possible to throw someone a surprise party without making them feel like crap first.", "NTA. If you plan a surprise party, you have to make plans for something else with the birthday person so that you know they\u2019re available and will come with you to the party. It\u2019s not your fault for not knowing about plans they never told you about.", "NTA. The person planning the party needs to find some way to make sure you're there. It seems like someone forgot to let you know that you needed to be there. That's 100% on them.", "Yeah my friend had a surprise party for his birthday and all his friends were in on it. We made sure he went to the right pub. \n\nPretty simple, your family got it wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. How hard would it have been for them to say \"Happy birthday\" you would not have been upset and then they could have surprised you with the party.", "Omg nta. It is kinda funny that they forgot the whole surprise part of this and you not knowing it was happening", "NTA and who is \"everyone \" that went home? Because you said you were with your friends and they weren't invited.  \n\nI've thrown surprise parties and there is always one friend designated as the wrangler and their job is to get the person to their party on time. \n\nHow was this not done for your party?", "NTA, they could\u2019ve asked you what you wanted to do for your birthday like to take you out for dinner and have everyone meet you there as a surprise.", "NTA. Your family messed this up if you\u2019re planning a surprise party need a plan to make sure the person is there!", "NTA \n\nI don't understand why having a surprise party means no one says happy birthday during the day? How ridiculous.", "NTA. Surprise parties are meant to be a surprise but you still have to do something to usher the guest of honor to the party.", "NTA. It's hardly your fault.", "NTA", "do people think they live in a movie or a sitcom?", "NTA and this is just further proof why surprise birthday parties suck. \n\nWho thinks it\u2019s appropriate or funny to ignore people and be rude like that just to \u2018up\u2019 the surprise element. The suprise doesn\u2019t erase the hurt they brought beforehand.\n\nAlso, You cannot miss a party you aren\u2019t officially invited to.", "There is too much information missing.\n\nYou mentioned you muted your phone because you were pouting leading me to believe someone DID try to usher you towards the party you just didn't hear it.", "Going to buck the trend and say YTA. It\u2019s ok to be hurt but you never gave them a chance by muting your phone and being pissy for most of the day. I feel like you should have let the day play out a bit before acting the way you did.", "NTA. They'll get over it and do better at planning next time.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou had a nice birthday. THEY were AHs and played stupid games ... and they failed spectacularly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have no reason to be pissed.", "NTA, I absolutely hate this trope that a surprise party should be preceded by people pretending to forget the birthday and making the birthday person feel sad and rejected.\n\nThis is NOT your fault. It's absolutely the fault of the people who thought that they would make you feel shitty all day so that the \"surprise\" would be better.", "NTA\n\nAITA if I laughed? I\u2019m always surprised this doesn\u2019t happen more often with surprise parties", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe the family are AHs for making OP feel bad the morning of his birthday, or maybe they just suck at surprise party planning and it isn't bad enough to make them AHs, but their poor planning (like a complete failure to let OP know they should be home at a certain time, or at least not be busy then) does NOT make OP the AH. If they are upset at him for missing the party, then they are AHs.", "They did not give themselves a chance. They should have had a plan in place already, and done more than this bs \"pretend we don't know\" thing.
