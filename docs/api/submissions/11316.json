What was their plan? Just hope you showed up?", "NTA - i don\u2019t understand these types of parties. Make someone feel like crap all day and then come home\nto a surprise party that they are not in the mood for.", "NTA.  They played the \"surprise party\" game really poorly.", "They like surprises so much, well they got one. NTA\n\nAnd now, soapbox time. This tv show trope of pretending to forget someone\u2019s birthday and ignoring them in order to surprise them later isn\u2019t cute or funny. It\u2019s abusive. Deliberately making your loved one feel bad is a terrible thing to do. Believe it or not, it\u2019s possible to throw someone a surprise party without making them feel like crap first.", "NTA. If you plan a surprise party, you have to make plans for something else with the birthday person so that you know they\u2019re available and will come with you to the party. It\u2019s not your fault for not knowing about plans they never told you about.", "NTA. The person planning the party needs to find some way to make sure you're there. It seems like someone forgot to let you know that you needed to be there. That's 100% on them.", "Yeah my friend had a surprise party for his birthday and all his friends were in on it.

It is kinda funny that they forgot the whole surprise part of this and you not knowing it was happening", "NTA and who is \"everyone \" that went home? Because you said you were with your friends and they weren't invited.  \n\nI've thrown surprise parties and there is always one friend designated as the wrangler and their job is to get the person to their party on time. \n\nHow was this not done for your party?", "NTA, they could\u2019ve asked you what you wanted to do for your birthday like to take you out for dinner and have everyone meet you there as a surprise.", "NTA. Your family messed this up if you\u2019re planning a surprise party need a plan to make sure the person is there!", "NTA \n\nI don't understand why having a surprise party means no one says happy birthday during the day?

It's hardly your fault.", "NTA", "do people think they live in a movie or a sitcom?", "NTA and this is just further proof why surprise birthday parties suck. \n\nWho thinks it\u2019s appropriate or funny to ignore people and be rude like that just to \u2018up\u2019 the surprise element.

Maybe the family are AHs for making OP feel bad the morning of his birthday, or maybe they just suck at surprise party planning and it isn't bad enough to make them AHs, but their poor planning (like a complete failure to let OP know they should be home at a certain time, or at least not be busy then) does NOT make OP the AH. If they are upset at him for missing the party, then they are AHs.", "They did not give themselves a chance. They should have had a plan in place already, and done more than this bs \"pretend we don't know\" thing.

He went out and ignored his phone. It's no different than someone having a shit day at work and turning their phone off when they get home for some quiet time. He was having a shit day so he went out with friends who seemed to actually care.", "NTA exact thing happened to me before too. I went out to dinner with a work colleague, we had a few drinks and then I went to the cinema for a late night showing. \n\nNo signal in the cinema and I'd gotten 1 singular text from a family member at about 8pm asking if I had any plans for my birthday. Surprise! They were waiting for me to come home. I'd said \"nothing interesting, it's not one of the big numbers so noones does celebrations for these, I appreciate the text though aunty x\". \n\nWell, I dunno what happened but people had been waiting about 3 hours at that point, and another hour and a half after it apparently. A neighbour stopped me around midnight and wished me a happy birthday on my way in the door, I said thanks, they were the 3rd person to remember me and I was chuffed(I thought it odd my neighbour even knew tbh). \n\nIn i walk to the living room and kitchen to yelling and screaming \"where have you been\" blah blah. They had about 40 people at the house earlier, it was a surprise! \n\nBig surprise, everyone just expected me to go home after work having been radio silence for over a week to messages on Facebook and messenger apps etc...noone thought to actually check with me or make even a small plan like \"hey, I thought I'd call over for an hour this evening\" or anything..I was asking people if they had plans and getting no response back. \n\nTo be fair, a lot of my friends and most family saw it my way, coz we actually had to have a sit down over exaggerated drama and work out who's the biggest idiot. The people who organised the whole thing and didn't Invite the actual person to celebrate, the people who ghosted me for a week when I tried to make plans or the people who were upset after standing around for hours without checking anything was setup. \n\nI'd been ghosted so hard that week I didn't feel like reaching out to any of my friends on the actual day, didn't see a point in going home so I went and treated myself. \n\nNTA, they are the only ones to blame.", "Rule #1 in throwing a surprise party is that someone's in charge of making sure that the Guest of Honor turns up.\n\nRule #2 is don't ignore the birthday person. It's a dick move.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. The whole point of the party was that you didn't know about it so why were they shocked that you didn't go? Poor planning on their part. Also, who did they invite to the party if you were already out with your friends?", "Info: How long did you have your phone muted? What time did you mute your phone? How old are you?", "NTA. Ignoring your birthday all day and then calling and texting to demand you come home is *not* how you get someone to a surprise party.\n\nThey felt it was okay to make you feel miserable and forgotten because they think they live in some movie where you're immediately forgiven and there are no hurt feelings because they threw you a *party*. If they'd watched those movies a little closer they would know that a) you have to get someone to insist they come, and b) completely ignoring someone's birthday is an AH move, regardless of your intentions.", "NTA - your dad should have taken you out for a few hours and an excuse while the others got the part ready. It's seems like they ignore you on a daily basis so they can't be that surprised that you needed some time out.\n\nI don't understand people who throw surprises parties but spend the while day ignoring that person or not even acknowledging that it's their birthday. If it was me I would definitely feel hurt and not want to be around them.", "NTA. You are not responsible for being psychic and knowing it is time to go home.", "NTA - they forgot one of the keys to a successful surprise party - getting the subject to arrive.", "How dare you not show up to the thing you didn't know about and was purposefully kept in the dark about! NTA they clearly are poor planners.", "What? How did they plan a surprise party with no one in on it to make sure your got there. That\u2019s rule 1 of surprise party planning.", "NTA, surprise parties are stupid and cruel most of the time but ESPECIALLY when family and friends pretend they've forgotten.\n\nAlso they only work when one person is designated to keep the birthday person distracted/busy all day and to get them to the party.\n\nIt's not your fault that your family half-assed it and ruined your birthday.", "NTA, they sound like they're terrible at surprise parties. Everybody knows you need a plan to get them to the party and not just hope they show up by chance.", "They still could\u2019ve texted or called to wish you a hbday. Also they needed a middle man who knew about the party to make sure op attends the party, amateurs lol NTA", "NTA. Yeah your family kinda failed here. Step 1 of a surprise party is to get someone to spend the day with you while your family sets up. They should have set you up with a friend at least a day or 2 before the party.", "NTA. Why does every surprise birthday party story start with everyone ignoring the birthday before hand? I don\u2019t get the thought process.", "NTA", "follow up question to the OP - do you normally mute your phone and not look at it for extended periods?  This seems unusual to me. If this isn't normal for you - why did you choose to do this on this particular day?   How you answer this could sway me from a NTA to a YTA.", "That exactly. \n\nWell they succeeded. They made her feel miserable and angry, she wanted NC for the rest of the evening and just hang out with friends (who also didn't know about the party).\n\nNTA", "Years ago, something similar happened to me, but it was a surprise baby shower. My husband made some weird excuse not to come home for dinner (he was working) and I knew something was up. I was sad all day thinking he was mad at me for some reason. A friend called and asked to go to dinner, so we did, but I really wasn't in the mood. Long story short (too late?) the friend to me by another friend's house and there was everyone to surprise me. I couldn't even enjoy it. I absolutely \\*hate\\* surprises and have told family that if they throw a surprise party - or a surprise anything, they will rue the day.", "even when pretend FA people can still FO for realsies", "Well they were upset because I had my phone muted, so I didn't see any of their calls or messages.\n\nThey mostly invited a lot of my stepbrother's friends who I hang out with sometimes. I was only out with two friends of mine, but my family has never met them.", "I checked it less that day than usual because I lost track of time, but I also don't get many messages from them to begin with. On a normal day, if I had been checking my phone, that number of messages from them would've had me very confused.\n\nI muted it that particular day because I was in a bad mood from them ignoring me more than usual on my birthday and I didn't want to be bothered by them if they did happen to call. It was also largely a petty act of revenge, which is why you might say that I am, in fact, TA.", "BOOM - YTA."]}
