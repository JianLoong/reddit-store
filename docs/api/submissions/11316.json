Surprise parties are stupid.", "NTA regardless of the phone thing they're mad you didn't know something you were purposely not told. That's ridiculous. It was a surprise party, not a scheduled event. So they call and you don't answer. This happens. I planned my surprise party for my spouse by planning the event to take place at a time and place I knew he would be. I knew he would be home at 8pm so everyone showed up before 8pm. He was surprised. That's how you do it. You don't just hope they show up or answer your calls. You plan this shit, they could have had your brother stay with you and make sure you showed up.", "It\u2019s like the party version of negging. I hate it. In all situations. Gifts. Proposals. Parties. Why make someone sad even if there\u2019s a happy part later?.", "Ghosted for a whole week!!? Mate, that's even worse than OP, you are so justified here.", "It's all fun and games when it's a scripted plot with professional actors with just the right level of wacky fuck ups and miscommunication that all resolves itself by the end of the half hour with ad breaks so they can move onto a new story next episode.", "Lol I did look at my phone a few times but when it's muted, it actually doesn't show whether or not I have any missed calls or anything. And at first I made a point to myself to not check for the whole day before losing track of time and forgetting my phone even existed", "We have a race in my family to be the first one to wish Happy Birthday.", "I'm the youngest of 5 children, 3 of us female. Both my older sisters were given surprise sweet 16 parties but when I turned 16 my mom said at that point it wouldn't be a surprise anyway so she just didn't plan anything.", "So many people give the cold shoulder for the day with a surprise party. It happened to me. I walked in the door crying after being ignored all day. Then they were mad at ME, of course, because how could I possibly think they'd forget me. Like...what?", "Up voted because that's hilarious and horrible all in one (but hopefully you had a great fish dinner \ud83d\ude06)", "It was a bit late then. You plan something with the bday person well before party time. Days- not minutes.", "people mute their phones all the time. they also often don't have signal or forget to charge them. unless you have a reasonable and communicated expectation that they be available, you can't just count on people to answer the phone and do whatever you want\n\nmaybe you make plans on your own with a couple friends and mute your phone because you wanna be in the moment. maybe you go somewhere where you have bad signal. maybe you forget to charge your phone. maybe someone spills a drink on it. maybe you hook up with someone and go to their place. maybe your car breaks down and you spend the evening dealing with getting it towed. maybe you went to a friends to watch some movies and you got a migraine and ended up lying down for a bit. maybe you get drunk or get food poisoning and are busy in the bathroom\n\nyou can't just rely on someone to have their phone on and be available at any time\n\nyou cannot just rely on someone to not make any plans on their own birthday  \n\nand if you ghost or avoid or ignore someone on their birthday in order to surprise them, don't be shocked if they don't want anything to do with you\n\n> They mostly invited a lot of my stepbrother's friends who I hang out with sometimes. I was only out with two friends of mine, but my family has never met them.\n\nlmaoooooo this wasn't even a party for you. they invited your step brothers friends, not yours. they didn't have someone close enough to you involved in the planning that they even knew who to invite", "IKR? Making someone feel like crap first is terrible.\n\nPlus they\u2019ll be even more surprised if you acted normally first. Do what looks like regular birthday celebrations, then the surprise is pulling out all the stops.", "You are being way too sensible and considerate - what would happen to this subreddit if everyone was as considerate and sensible as you? Hmmmm?", "I landed two whole birthday surprises for my boyfriend one year (a dinner surprise I coordinated with a bunch of out of town friends followed by a surprise party at our regular spot with everyone else). He knew about the plan to have dinner at this fancy place we wanted to try & then grab drinks. All my treat for his birthday. Everything else was the surprise. Not once did I consider pretending to forget his birthday. How else do I make sure it goes according to plan? Also, rude.", "Rule for a surprise party is to warn the surprisee with \"there is a small party, act surprised!\".  Then go wild.", "It was still a surprise. The would-be party throwers were surprised someone would just go \"Fine, if nobody's going to celebrate my birthday, I'll just go out and celebrate it myself\"", "This is a reductive way to look at how OP felt. Being given the cold shoulder/ignores by everyone that you think cares about you, on your birthday no less, can cause someone to fall into a depression. That is so different from pouting.\n\nOP, NTA.", "Ok, but the day off is a little last minute.", "It takes all of 30 seconds to say something like \"let's go to dinner for your birthday next week, meet at dad's house at 6 and we'll figure out where we're going then.\" The birthday person gets acknowledged and also doesn't make plans. \n\nAs far as OP knew, there was nowhere specific they needed to be. So OP chose to hang out with friends. That's not childish, it's making plans to enjoy their birthday.", "It is only childish because you want to define it in a childish way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe adult thing to do is set it up better. Therefore his parents were being childish.", "If it was my birthday and people ignored me and didn't acknowledge me I would not talk to them either and my phone is normally on silent if I don't remember to put it on vibrate if they wanted to have a surprise party they should have made sure the person was informed to be there possibly for a small party"]}
