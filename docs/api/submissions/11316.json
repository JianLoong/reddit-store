They played the \"surprise party\" game really poorly.", "They like surprises so much, well they got one. NTA\n\nAnd now, soapbox time. This tv show trope of pretending to forget someone\u2019s birthday and ignoring them in order to surprise them later isn\u2019t cute or funny. It\u2019s abusive.

I went out to dinner with a work colleague, we had a few drinks and then I went to the cinema for a late night showing. \n\nNo signal in the cinema and I'd gotten 1 singular text from a family member at about 8pm asking if I had any plans for my birthday. Surprise! They were waiting for me to come home. I'd said \"nothing interesting, it's not one of the big numbers so noones does celebrations for these, I appreciate the text though aunty x\". \n\nWell, I dunno what happened but people had been waiting about 3 hours at that point, and another hour and a half after it apparently. A neighbour stopped me around midnight and wished me a happy birthday on my way in the door, I said thanks, they were the 3rd person to remember me and I was chuffed(I thought it odd my neighbour even knew tbh). \n\nIn i walk to the living room and kitchen to yelling and screaming \"where have you been\" blah blah. They had about 40 people at the house earlier, it was a surprise! \n\nBig surprise, everyone just expected me to go home after work having been radio silence for over a week to messages on Facebook and messenger apps etc...noone thought to actually check with me or make even a small plan like \"hey, I thought I'd call over for an hour this evening\" or anything..I was asking people if they had plans and getting no response back. \n\nTo be fair, a lot of my friends and most family saw it my way, coz we actually had to have a sit down over exaggerated drama and work out who's the biggest idiot.

Ignoring your birthday all day and then calling and texting to demand you come home is *not* how you get someone to a surprise party.\n\nThey felt it was okay to make you feel miserable and forgotten because they think they live in some movie where you're immediately forgiven and there are no hurt feelings because they threw you a *party*.

Over the course of a couple of hours, the small lunch had turned into a mass gathering of friends and cousins.

Even I would be ok with that kind of surprise party.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve planned a few and I always set up a small birthday thing they knew about and then surprised them with the actual party a bit earlier.
