I (49F) have been a single mother since 2013. I have three children; Izzy (23F) and Crystal and Katherine (21F twins). My mother Nancy (69) moved in with us last year and for a while everything was great. At the moment only my oldest and my oldest twin live with me, as does my oldest daughter's roommate Rebecca (22F). Last month Izzy developed a stomach ulcer. She has a doctor's appointment in two weeks to get an endoscopy in order to decide on proper treatment. Ever since the diagnosis Izzy has been taking good care of herself and recently spent close to $100 on food that is safe for her to eat and has developed a rigid routine to help kickstart the healing process; things like bread, fish, chicken, kefir milk, and plenty of fruits and veggies.\n\nMy mother, however, for reasons still unknown to me, believes my kids lie about everything and that Izzy is faking her ulcer for attention. Over the weekend while I was in WV visiting family my daughter stayed over at her aunt's house to babysit and took some of the food with her. She came home on Monday night and called me crying because over the weekend my mother tore up the kitchen and ate most of her recovery food, throwing away whatever she didn't like or wasn't safe to feed to our dogs and our rabbit. I immediately called my mom and demanded to know why she did that because now Izzy and Crystal have to go shopping all over again after she just spent so much of her hard-earned money on her new dietary needs. My mother simply said that she was lying anyway and was just looking for an excuse to \"pig out and garner sympathy for a condition which she does not have\". I was so confused about how a girl is supposed to allegedly \"pig out\" on salmon, smoothies, and dried fruits as well as fake paperwork from a gastroenterologist.\n\nI decided this was the last straw and notarized an eviction notice yesterday. I served her at midnight. She's been packing all morning and has had some rather colorful opinions about me and the rest of my household.

She should have to pay for the food that she ate and threw away, in addition to being evicted from your house. I would not be surprised if your kids end up going NC with her. She's ridiculous and you did not go too far.", "NTA. There was literally no plausible explanation for your mom doing what she did other than a lifelong dedication to being an AH. She didn't buy the food.  She wasn't asked to provide caregiving assistance to Izzy. I don't think Izzy was faking it, but even if she was, how on earth did this hurt your mom? It didn't, and yet she threw a huge tantrum anyway.", "NTA- thank you for standing up for your kids. I went through a similar thing with my own mother, who lived with us for 21 years. She was going behind my back and trying to turn my kids against me and was horrible to my daughter. It was a nightmare of epic proportions. She ended up going on a trip out of state and when I asked her to stay just two more weeks so I could get a handle on some things here, she told everyone we kicked her out and lied about everything. It\u2019s taken me 5 years to process after going no contact with her. But I can tell you, my kids and my husband are in a much better place without her here. You did the right thing, OP and your kids will be thankful you stood up for them.", "NTA. She's not medically qualified and has absolutely no idea. FAFO.", "NTA sounds like your mother doesn't like the attention your daughter is getting. She sabotaged all your daughters food by destroying it and feeding it to the animals. When someone starts committing spiteful acts out of jealousy, then you need to get them out of your safe space, as they are not safe to be around. They start off with small acts of spite, but it gets worse and worse and becomes more and more dangerous. It is pointless doing the, 'if you do not stop, you must leave,' talk, it won't work, they just get sneakier and more sly with the malicious acts. My own mother was like this, so I've had first hand experience of it.", "NTA. And absolutely go no contact. She is a hateful woman who did everything she could to hurt her own grandchildren. She can be awful away from you.", "NTA. Your mom is, however.  It doesn\u2019t matter why your daughter bought the food, you mom shouldn\u2019t have eaten whatever she wanted and thrown out what she didn\u2019t like.  Your mom is abusive.  Props to you for keeping your daughter safe and evicting your mom.", "NTA for sure! Sounds like she wondered into a happy household and was like \"nope, gotta start drama!\"\n\nIs this out of character for her? How did she just suddenly need a place to stay?", "Absolutely nta.\n\nYour mom disrespected you and your daughter on multiple levels here.\n\n1.

I hope your daughter recovers quickly.", "NTA. She poked the bear and got swiped!! Protect your daughter, your mother is a nightmare. Set her flying monkeys straight when they come for you and let them know that they are free to house her since you are so evil.", "NTA. I'd say eviction is the minimum reasonable reaction. Stealing food is bad, throwing out good food is worse, but it's the insistence that your kids are lying that is truly intolerable. Without the accusations, perhaps an ultimatum to pay for replacement food with a sincere apology or get out would be more reasonable. With the accusations, eviction alone or eviction and a demand for repayment seems rather charitable. Going NC is a bit harder to be certain on, but I would definitely reduce to minimal contact in your shoes.", "NTA.  Wow - OP's mom sounds like a bad dream.  How could she do this to her own grandchild?  OP's mom brought this on herself and has no one else to blame.\n\nYes, go NC with her.  I wouldn't ever want her around my children again.", "NTA Your mother has some pretty warped ideas. Generally, if someone was going to seek attention about their health they would choose something other than an ulcer. Your daughter paid for the special food out of her own pocket. What\u2019s it to grandma how she chooses to spend her money? You made a very hard decision but one that needed to be made. Grandma should be happy she no longer has to be around an \u201cattention seeker\u201d.\nEdit: changed to ulcer instead of gallbladder, my mistake", "NTA, your mother actively sabotaged your daughters health because she felt your daughter was lying. That makes your mother the entitled ah here full stop, and she should be the one handing over the money to replace the food also. The only way you would be the ah in this situation is if you didn't take steps to protect your daughter from her abusive grandmother.", "NTA - Don't think you took it too far, soon your daughter is going to run out of money replacing the foods your mom throws out. She has to heal, this is something treatable your mother is an ass.   PS. The stress of this wrenched might be part of the cause of the ulcer.    You go mamma bear, stand up for your babies!", "NTA\n\nYour mother says your daughter will \u2018pig out\u2019 and teaches her a lesson by\u2026 \u2018pigging out\u2019?\n\nMakes perfect sense. /s", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are right to protect your daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My fathers accusations (my favourite is that I faked thr x-ray I never held in my hands that showed a severe injury) made me always rethink everything, feeling I'm wasting the time of doctors and imagining my symptoms. This march marks two years of when I was very lucky to survive the combination of peritonitis (my body randomly gets organ inflammation and since I didn't get help in time my gallbladder burst) which lead to kidney infarction (my peritonitis had progressed to the point of my organs shutting down), pneumonia, pleural effusion because the pneumonia went untreated for months (I even went on long walks in the hills until the aforementioned injury, with the pneumonia and cursing myself for being \"out of shape\"), mononucleosis and kidney infection. I must have an army of guardian angels, especially since they couldn't put me in the nessecary coma because the ICU was full with COVID patients). The reason I survived at all was because a friend forced me to call an ambulance (otherwise she would have sent it to me). I was laying there in agony and thought it's not worth asking for help. \n\nLast Friday my GP ordered me to come in on Monday because I was having serious symptoms (I have been dealing with chronic gastritis and reflux disorder for more than half a year now, the former is a consequence of the aforementioned peritonitis because the life saving surgery lead to bile reflux, meaning that the bile goes straight into my stomach. They had to remove tons of bile to see something in my gastroscopy on Tuesday). Since after getting rid of my cortisone on Friday I was feeling better I had a very hard time to make myself go to the appointment thinking it's a waste of my GP's time and he'll think me a whiny baby for coming. I wouldn't have gone if he hadn't demanded it and it still was hard. He was shocked at my state, immediately did some exams to rule out another peritonitis and internal bleeding, ordered extensive bloodwork and an emergency gastroscopy the next day. I'm scheduled to go in Monday for the results and am fighting very hard with myself to not wait but go in tomorrow or Friday (depending on how I can organise it) as today I started to get bleedings in and under my eyes, became mostly bedridden and I need to examine my eyes again tomorrow to see if they're actually turning yellow or if that was just a trick of the electric lighting on my bloodshot eyes.\n\nThank you for protecting your daughters from my fate and standing up for them.

Mom and dad didn\u2019t tolerate any bullshit.", "Someone who steals things that are not theirs WILL do so again, and probably did in the past without others realizing it. It is always grounds for eviction.", "Please go in tomorrow. Your feelings and symptoms matter.", "As someone who has been disabled and chronically ill since infancy,an unfortunate number of people really don't believe that young people do get seriously ill-that they must be exaggerating or faking it all together. I'm sorry your daughter has to deal with this on top of her health issues, but you are absolutely doing the right thing protecting her while she heals.", "So it sounds like your mother has been like this before. But I just want to say, being contrary and argumentative and thinking that people are lying etc. reminds me a lot of the beginning symptoms in my older relatives for dementia. Both my aunt and my grandmother have been like this. My aunt was already considered to be mean so most of my family just attributed it to that, but I knew it wasn't right. It was 4 years and a hospitalisation before my aunt got help because it wasn't obvious to anyone else.  \n  \nJust a thought given the age.   \n  \nNeither my aunt nor my grandmother showed obvious memory loss for a few years into the illness though that's what people think dementia mainly is.", "You should have helped yourself upchuck or spew that sabotaged food as diarrhea all over their bathroom surfaces and floor, and wherever else possible And not cleaned it up\u2026..", "It makes me think perhaps there is more to the story?  The mother must have some kind of issue with Izzy, and is unwilling to share it.  Because if that's not the case, the level of AH here is hard to fathom.", "She had a knee injury a few years ago, so probably wasn't able to compete in her usual event of puppy punting. It's really inspirational that she's finding a new passion this late in life. /s", "Oh, yuck.  I only had 1 bleeder, and it was miserable.  I couldn't even drink alcohol on my 21st birthday because I had a bleeding ulcer.\n\nI got mine from overuse of Ibuprofen, and not H.*pylori*.  (Spine issues.  Yay!)  The only way the MDs knew that, though, was after they dropped a scope down my throat.", "Stress IS one of the main causes...", "NTA - Is there a history of this? Is this a deviation from her personality, at all? If this nastiness is recent, even over 4 years, ramping up... I'd be worried there was an underlying cognitive or neurological concern developing. Given her age.\n\nBecause it doesn't make sense all of a sudden. If this is an aspect of her personality for forever, then yeah. Totally justified.", "NTA and your a good mum. I hope your daughter recovers soon.", "NTA\n\nHow horrible for her to behave that way!", "NTA she bullies your kids that\u2019s a big no no", "Sharing DNA with someone *does not* mean you are obligated to accept their abuse. Full stop. NTA.", "NTA\n\nyour mother should be paying back your daughters.", "You? Nooo... no no. That woman is cruel. The girl has already been seen by a doctor who diagnosed it and she insists it isn't real??\n\nThere is unfortunately a trend of young people faking illness and disorders, but those kids are self diagnosing and putting on an act for tictok, ect, they *aren't* people with doctor diagnosed issues nor trying to get better.\n\nDoes your mother have a history of faking or exaggerating and is either assuming others act like her or misdirecting her own gilt?", "I n f o: what in the ever burning hell is wrong with your mom?\n\nNope, hard NTA. Your mother is actively trying to harm your kid for devil knows what reason (and we all know it's not a legit one), you would have been the AH if you didn't stand up to her.

To even think that your daughter is faking her health problem. And then she decided to eat all the food and throw the rest when your daughter bought it to help improve her health condition by avoiding certain foods that harm her stomach. You have every rights to kick your mother out of the house. After that make sure to get home sercurity camera and change the locks because if your mom is petty. She may come back trash your house. And have a home sercurity may help catching her in the act then you can sue her.", "If your daughter needs proton pump inhibitors long term, make sure she knows to take vitamins. The reason the bottle says not to take longer than 14 days is that when your stomach acid is low you're not able to absorb nutrients.\n\nI took protein pump inhibitors for years, no one told me about the vitamin thing, and ended up really sick from vitamin deficiencies. I was taking prenatal vitamins and still anemic, with vitamin d levels at 1/3 the minimum, just to give you an idea of how badly absorption is affected. I'm on a ludicrous number of supplements just to stay at normal levels.", "NTA. r/JustNoFamily is the sub for you!", "NTA. You sound like a great mom", "So your daughter was lying so she could pig out and your mom figured that the best way to deal with this was to pig out on daughter\u2019s stuff herself?

But remember, she us elderly, so she may not have much more time to screw- up your life.\n\n NTA", "NTA Kicking her our is correct, she's abusing your daughter. Go no contact.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something hateful like this and expected you to just get over it. Good for you!", "NTA. Whether or not your daughter is faking is not her problem. It is between you and your daughter. She overstepped", "So NTA and I applauded you on doing what you needed to do instantly. So many people waiver and get stuck between loved ones they end up doing more damage before they grow a back bone and do what's needed.\n\nThe only thing you could possibly do is see if your mom will sit down with you and be honest, without being nasty, and find out what the actual issue is. The only thing I could think is this is coming from a place of issues people have as they get older, and could in fact be an early(ish) warning sign of something bigger. However, you're not obligated to do that or entertain that there could be more going on here. If your mom doesn't believe this, then really you're doing her a favor by keeping her out of whatever drama she thinks is happening. You're doing right for not only your daughter l, but your entire household by not adding more stress to the situation.", "NTA. My god! your mother just has absolutely no empathy for your daughter all. It's hard enough getting diagnosed with an illness, i can't imagine my grandmother yelling at me and calling me an attention-seeker at the same time.\n\nholy pancakes. Your mother needs to get a grip & get out of the house. It's unfortunate that its reached this point, but she sounds very set in her ways, and this is probably the best way to prevent future harm to your daughter.", "OP said things were fine with her mom last year and then things changed. Has her mom been checked by a doctor? There are many diseases that sometimes can cause cognitive issues. Before she evicts her I would suggest she have a thorough medical check on her mom to make sure her mom isn\u2019t actually ill with cognitive symptoms.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had roommates and family members eat my food without replacing and it is extremely disrespectful and disgusting behavior. With how expensive food is today and especially for special diets, what your mom did is absolutely ridiculous. Your mom tried to sabotage your daughter\u2019s recovery, Ulcers are NO joke, I almost lost s grandparent because of a stomach ulcer. What would have happened if your daughter hadn\u2019t had the money to replace the food and you couldn\u2019t help either? It\u2019s just controlling, abusive behavior and you were right to make her leave.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing the right things!\n\nThere are folks who don\u2019t believe in food allergies and intolerances. Imagine if your daughter had a severe nut allergy and your mother snuck some nuts into her food. Would you rather have that situation or keep your daughter away from potential harm?", "NTA\n\n1. She stole food that didn't belong to her\n2. She purposely sabotaged your daughter's health because she decided she wanted attention for it \n3. If going NC is something you want to do then do it", "NTA in what world is her getting healthy considered attention seeking? Your mother has issues she needs to sort out and I would definitely go nc until she apologized, replaced the food and saw a therapist", "I'm wondering how much food $100 will buy.  I mean....your mom sounds like the AH here, but when your \"tear up\" a kitchen...what does $100 of groceries look like?", "It never ceases to amaze me how awful some people can be when they want to be right rather than kind. Like, what does it matter to her **if** your daughter is just being attention getting? So what? If it's behaviour that isn't hurting anyone there are ways of handling it that don't involve dismissing a child out of hand. It's almost like she's offended at the very idea that your daughter exists and has emotions.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Also she should pay for the food she stole. That was not house groceries. That was personal property.", "It sounds like your mother is starting developing dementia. Paranoia, stupid offences and illogical ideas are very usual for this period. Sadly, it can't be fully treated and it just becomes worse with time. And illness doesn't make an old person asshole. It makes him/her an old person with dementia.", "NTA. But, am I the only one who thinks that grandma should be checked for mental illness of some sort?  It seems like her behavior changed drastically since last year.", "Absolutely NTA, bit of background I had a similar issue. I injured my knee sleepwalking when I was 14. My bio father instead of listening to and believing his child decided to believe his girlfriend who said I was faking it for attention. It didn't heal right and I wasn't able to get any treatment for it till I was 16. I have chronic knee pain because of my father's decisions. I applaud you for listening to your daughter and standing up to your mother. Evicting her was the right choice and I definitely recommend going no contact. Anyone who does these kinds of things are the worst people", "Yep, it sounds like this behaviour is the result of similar toxic/abusive behaviour from the OP's mother's parents to her, and the OP is doing the right thing by preventing it from crossing into further generations.", "This. So much. I've experienced it, also. Plus some older folks get meaner and more contrary as they age. I've seen it, unfortunately. Is it a general dissatisfaction with their own lives? A desire to drag everyone along on their miserable trip through life? \nDefinitely NTA, OP.", "This is the smartest answer here. Some older folks get all sorts of paranoid - think their caretakers are stealing for them, etc. And they can regress into acting like crazy children.", "Most parents would evict their Own mother if she was causing their child financial and emotional stress. It\u2019s called being a good parent", "If this is the explanation you\u2019ve done your mother a solid. Now she can garner sympathy for a home she does not have. If you go NC she can garner sympathy for a daughter she does not have. Both of those should gain her more sympathy than the ulcer your daughter does not have.", "Did this behavior surprise you?", "Look I get unreasonable desires for attention because my sister was in the spotlight all the time while we were growing up and I got less attention than her but I keep that shit to myself.", "What age is your mother? 4? She's a grown ass woman in her 69th year. Tell her to mature, and if you so choose, you can stop communicating with her. Wonderful choice, OP.", "It\u2019s sad that she feels that way and it\u2019s her responsibility as a grown ass adult to deal with it. Good on you for standing up to her and protecting your child.

May need consideration.", "My first thought when she said she tore up the kitchen", "my family member has celiac. There is no vomiting or diarrhea with her, she'll just go straight to the hospital if she has gluten. Happened once when a waiter didn't believe her, she was in/out of the hospital for 3 weeks.

It\u2019s heartbreaking how callous people can be, and for what?", "Gosh this is horrible, I hope that imbecile of a waiter was made to at least pay her hospital bills. Better yet, as could be if it happened where I live, the waiter got charged for assault (or attempted murder dependending on the severity) and got a criminal record.

That is jail worthy and certainly worth following up on, a lawsuit needs to be followed up on. You would be wrong if you think he hasn\u2019t done it before and wouldn\u2019t do it again. He needs to be removed from that industry. What if he costs someone their life? Plus 3 wks is nothing to sneeze at, sue the establishment, you know the timeline, they\u2019ll give him up, this needs to be pursued for other people who may not be so lucky and your family member got a hard hit so maybe someone may not be even as fortunate as even 3 wks, would if he does even more serious damage?, bcuz it can always get worse. Please think about it.", "God, I really hope that waiter was eaten by dogs or something.", "I'm so sorry this happened to your family,  hope things are getting better for you all.", "If it happened more than 2 years ago (1 in many jurisditlctions) the statute of limitations has passed."]}
