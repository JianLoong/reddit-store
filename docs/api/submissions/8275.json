{"id": 8275, "submission_id": "10lb2km", "title": "AITA for evicting my mother after the way she accused my daughter of faking her illness?", "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short. I (49F) have been a single mother since 2013. I have three children; Izzy (23F) and Crystal and Katherine (21F twins). My mother Nancy (69) moved in with us last year and for a while everything was great. At the moment only my oldest and my oldest twin live with me, as does my oldest daughter's roommate Rebecca (22F). Last month Izzy developed a stomach ulcer. She has a doctor's appointment in two weeks to get an endoscopy in order to decide on proper treatment. Ever since the diagnosis Izzy has been taking good care of herself and recently spent close to $100 on food that is safe for her to eat and has developed a rigid routine to help kickstart the healing process; things like bread, fish, chicken, kefir milk, and plenty of fruits and veggies.\n\nMy mother, however, for reasons still unknown to me, believes my kids lie about everything and that Izzy is faking her ulcer for attention. Over the weekend while I was in WV visiting family my daughter stayed over at her aunt's house to babysit and took some of the food with her. She came home on Monday night and called me crying because over the weekend my mother tore up the kitchen and ate most of her recovery food, throwing away whatever she didn't like or wasn't safe to feed to our dogs and our rabbit. I immediately called my mom and demanded to know why she did that because now Izzy and Crystal have to go shopping all over again after she just spent so much of her hard-earned money on her new dietary needs. My mother simply said that she was lying anyway and was just looking for an excuse to \"pig out and garner sympathy for a condition which she does not have\". I was so confused about how a girl is supposed to allegedly \"pig out\" on salmon, smoothies, and dried fruits as well as fake paperwork from a gastroenterologist.\n\nI decided this was the last straw and notarized an eviction notice yesterday. I served her at midnight. She's been packing all morning and has had some rather colorful opinions about me and the rest of my household. I am considering going no contact after the move, but did I go too far? AITA for evicting my own mother from my home?", "created_utc": 1674684062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lb2km/aita_for_evicting_my_mother_after_the_way_she/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did right, your mom has issues", "NTA\n\nLet's put it in clearer terms.\n\nYour mother just sabotaged your daughter's health because she felt like it. That's abuse. Your mom is abusing your daughter.\n\nYou'd be TA if you didn't get her as far away from your daughter as you can.", "NTA -- I'm surprised she didn't accuse you or the children of faking the eviction notice.", "NTA   \nYour mom's a real piece of work, that's for sure. She should have to pay for the food that she ate and threw away, in addition to being evicted from your house. I would not be surprised if your kids end up going NC with her. She's ridiculous and you did not go too far.", "NTA. There was literally no plausible explanation for your mom doing what she did other than a lifelong dedication to being an AH. She didn't buy the food.  She wasn't asked to provide caregiving assistance to Izzy. I don't think Izzy was faking it, but even if she was, how on earth did this hurt your mom? It didn't, and yet she threw a huge tantrum anyway.", "NTA- thank you for standing up for your kids. I went through a similar thing with my own mother, who lived with us for 21 years. She was going behind my back and trying to turn my kids against me and was horrible to my daughter. It was a nightmare of epic proportions. She ended up going on a trip out of state and when I asked her to stay just two more weeks so I could get a handle on some things here, she told everyone we kicked her out and lied about everything. It\u2019s taken me 5 years to process after going no contact with her. But I can tell you, my kids and my husband are in a much better place without her here. You did the right thing, OP and your kids will be thankful you stood up for them.", "NTA. She's not medically qualified and has absolutely no idea. FAFO.", "NTA sounds like your mother doesn't like the attention your daughter is getting. She sabotaged all your daughters food by destroying it and feeding it to the animals. When someone starts committing spiteful acts out of jealousy, then you need to get them out of your safe space, as they are not safe to be around. They start off with small acts of spite, but it gets worse and worse and becomes more and more dangerous. It is pointless doing the, 'if you do not stop, you must leave,' talk, it won't work, they just get sneakier and more sly with the malicious acts. My own mother was like this, so I've had first hand experience of it.", "NTA. And absolutely go no contact. She is a hateful woman who did everything she could to hurt her own grandchildren. She can be awful away from you.", "NTA. Your mom is, however.  It doesn\u2019t matter why your daughter bought the food, you mom shouldn\u2019t have eaten whatever she wanted and thrown out what she didn\u2019t like.  Your mom is abusive.  Props to you for keeping your daughter safe and evicting your mom.", "NTA for sure! Sounds like she wondered into a happy household and was like \"nope, gotta start drama!\"\n\nIs this out of character for her? How did she just suddenly need a place to stay?", "Absolutely nta.\n\nYour mom disrespected you and your daughter on multiple levels here.\n\n1. She disrespected your daughter by destroying her property.\n\n2. She disrespected your daughter with a baseless accusation of being a liar.\n\n3. She disrespected you by claiming you RAISED a liar.\n\n4. She essentially called you an idiot for supporting your daughter who is suffering.\n\n5. She overstepped her bounds by attempting to correct your daughter.\n\nShe wants to run your home and has no claim to do so as a guest.\n\nI respect you for sticking up for daughter, the most important thing a parent can do(arguably) is protect their children. \n\nIt's a shame you had to protect your daughter against your own mom, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nI remember puking blood when I developed an ulcer in college, it's not fun. I hope your daughter recovers quickly.", "NTA. She poked the bear and got swiped!! Protect your daughter, your mother is a nightmare. Set her flying monkeys straight when they come for you and let them know that they are free to house her since you are so evil.", "NTA. I'd say eviction is the minimum reasonable reaction. Stealing food is bad, throwing out good food is worse, but it's the insistence that your kids are lying that is truly intolerable. Without the accusations, perhaps an ultimatum to pay for replacement food with a sincere apology or get out would be more reasonable. With the accusations, eviction alone or eviction and a demand for repayment seems rather charitable. Going NC is a bit harder to be certain on, but I would definitely reduce to minimal contact in your shoes.", "NTA.  Wow - OP's mom sounds like a bad dream.  How could she do this to her own grandchild?  OP's mom brought this on herself and has no one else to blame.\n\nYes, go NC with her.  I wouldn't ever want her around my children again.", "NTA Your mother has some pretty warped ideas. Generally, if someone was going to seek attention about their health they would choose something other than an ulcer. Your daughter paid for the special food out of her own pocket. What\u2019s it to grandma how she chooses to spend her money? You made a very hard decision but one that needed to be made. Grandma should be happy she no longer has to be around an \u201cattention seeker\u201d.\nEdit: changed to ulcer instead of gallbladder, my mistake", "NTA, your mother actively sabotaged your daughters health because she felt your daughter was lying. That makes your mother the entitled ah here full stop, and she should be the one handing over the money to replace the food also. The only way you would be the ah in this situation is if you didn't take steps to protect your daughter from her abusive grandmother.", "NTA - Don't think you took it too far, soon your daughter is going to run out of money replacing the foods your mom throws out. She has to heal, this is something treatable your mother is an ass.   PS. The stress of this wrenched might be part of the cause of the ulcer.    You go mamma bear, stand up for your babies!", "NTA\n\nYour mother says your daughter will \u2018pig out\u2019 and teaches her a lesson by\u2026 \u2018pigging out\u2019?\n\nMakes perfect sense. /s", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are right to protect your daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe YTA for a midnight eviction? Seems a weird hour. Kudos for you trying to live with your mom. I would not be able to do that. Ever. In a trillion years. And I really cared about my mom.

All the best.", "NTA Your mom is clearly out of line but has she shown any sign of mental deterioration or has she always been like this?", "NTA", "You\u2019re NTA and a good mom.", "NTA.

There\u2019s no reason this should bother your mother as much as it does. That\u2019s insane. I hope your daughter starts feeling better soon. This stress cannot be good for her ulcer.", "Nta. Your kids will always be more important. The fact your mother doesn\u2019t agree says a lot about her", "NTA, but stomach ulcers are caused by a bacteria, and they simply give a specific combination of antibiotics. Why would they need to do an endoscopy to determine treatment? Did something change about what we know about ulcers, or does she have some other medical issues that complicate things?", "NTA and you didn't go far ENOUGH! You should force her to pay for all the food she ate or wasted. Your mother is completely out of her mind, the arrogance and entitlement is astounding. Good for sticking to your daughter!", "I'm guessing in between the time you evicted your own mother and from the moment you heard your mother say that your daughter is faking her illness, I'm sure you had the talk yes?   like \"if she doesn't stop, she'll have to move elsewhere?\" \n\nIf you've already given her notices telling her to stop saying that about your own granddaughter, then I don't know as far as to go evicting your own mother? soft AH. but I get why but I'm sure there were other ways.", "No I 100 percent agree my parents dogs and my grandmother died from cancer if someone lies about having cancer they should be called out. Btw give me an upvote please", "NTA, even is she were to be wanting attention (which I for sure know isn't the case) she bought the food with her own money so the grandmother had no right to do anything about it, making less of a medical situation is a dangerous behaviour and you are right to put an end to it.", "Thank you for standing up for your daughter.

You would only be the AH if you DIDN'T take action against your mother.", "We think it might be because she messed up her knee in 2016 after a car crash and she, unfortunately, got a lot of attention from it over the course of about a year. Our best guess is that now that my daughter is sick it set off something in her and she wanted to get the attention off of my little girl.", "Oh, and she stole. She intentionally caused emotional and financial harm to OP\u2019s daughter (what one may call financial abuse) by stealing over 100 dollars worth of specialised food that she knew was not hers to eat.

She wants to make Grandmaster status this year. Wow. NTA.", "Not all ulcers are the same or easily cured. It's a combo of meds for acid, sometimes antibiotics if that is the cause, and FOOD ADJUSTMENTS. In my case avoiding everything that causes acid like citrus and tomato sauce etc. Been over a year for me and the fight continues. When you are on meds, eating differently,  and having tunes shoved down your throat, costs and stress add up. Oh...and stress is bad for ulcers. 100% not cheap or easy to fix for everyone.  Endoscopy locates ulcers(s), restrictions, and can confirm that it isn't something much worse  or a compounding of conditions. It also allows them to check your esophagus for damage and more.
