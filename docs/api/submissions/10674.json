What's actually wrong with the books?", "NTA\n\nHow are you in any way obligated to give ANY of your books? Let alone signed copies from an author to a series of books shelved FOR ADULTS?!? I\u2019m a huge wheel of time fan so I wouldn\u2019t let them go either. You even were considerate enough to complete the set with other used copies. Your sister should be thanking you.", "NTA. The proper word is generous.", "NTA  Some folks are just not appreciative.  A simple thank you would have been fine.  Your generosity is evident, even if your sis doesn't see it.  Great job!", "NTA - And honestly I\u2019d reconsider donating the books to needier kids at that point if it\u2019s going to be such a hassle for her\u2026", "NTA, LOL at the entitlement of your sister.

Almost sounds like she'd want to sell the books.\n\nHowever don't punish the kids for the adult being an AH. Give the kids some books, but nothing worth money so the mom can't be an AH here.

Mainly off the top of my head, mattresses, bras, underwear, bathing suits, pillows, I would be wary of couches or other upholstery (my dads an exterminator and scared me off bed bugs but I did accept a family friends used couch that I use to this day and I would prolly buy something if my dad inspected it for me and I deep cleaned the sucker).  I grew up on second hand everything (and I\u2019m the first child!). My first apartment was ala goodwill, my childhood shopping sprees were Saturday morning thrift shop hopping. I was an avid reader and books cost $10 min new so my favorite store was a place called half price books which was like a GameStop for books/records /dvds so I\u2019d buy all the pre owned books for pennies and boy did it make me happy.  My dad would bring home random shit from people/clients who offered him sthff and we\u2019d sort through and keep what we wanted and re-donate what we didn\u2019t. I slowly replaced things as I got more money. I go to goodwill all the time to find clothes and home knickknacks. Plato\u2019s closet is a goldmine. My sister certainly never complained about my hand me downs (and she created her own by stealing my clothes). Once upon a child is amazing for parents looking for kids clothes. They don\u2019t take stained shit, and kids grow out of clothes so fast they prolly wore it 2-10 times max before it was donated. I don\u2019t see the issue. It\u2019s washed, it\u2019s hygienic, it\u2019s economical, it\u2019s eco friendly. I just really could never get along with someone who has this attitude.
