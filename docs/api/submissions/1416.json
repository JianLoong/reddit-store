I feel like AH is a bit harsh but I definitely wouldn't have gotten so mad about this.\n\n Also I had an IUD it started cutting me from the inside, swore rhem off. so I switched to nexplanon (it goes in your arm) the first one hurt a bit and did move slightly. The other two (they last 3 yrs) were fine. I loved it .001% chance of pregnancy, I didn't have a period only slight spotting of I was stressed or sick.(which normally changes things with me.) I do have a slight non noticeable scar.
