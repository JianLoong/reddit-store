In recent years I've been in many arguments with family and friends that say, \"oh, you've grown out of that stuff,\". I have also had people put stuff in my food that I shouldn't have because it makes me sick. So, I've started just not eating at events with food and simply eating before or after so I'm not going hungry. This makes family and friends mad and most believe I just don't like their cooking or I'm a picky eater.

How would they know?", "I've got GERD too, and it's terrible. Thankfully I'm on some good medicine that controls it. NTA. If it was me, next time they comment, I'd say, \"Well then, if you want me to eat this food, YOU can come over and deal with my vomiting and other issues!\" I'm with whoever said bring your own food or stop going. It's just not worth it IMO.", "NTA. Gerd is fucking awful.

You have people in your life that do not care about your health condition and you've absolutely done the right thing by taking control over any situation you find yourself.

Those meals are usually rich, often spicy, and just not on your diet.\n\nYou are not being rude or disrespectful; you are being honest!  \n\nMy mother and her sibs have all kids of IBS, Crohn's, etc.  I (56F) have watched them struggle all their lives.  I happen to have the stomach of a goat and can eat anything at any time - must be from my father's side.\n\nStay loyal to yourself, or stop attending the events.  You deserve better.  Or better yet, send them pix of what happens in the toilet if you don't stick to your diet.    \n\nI cannot believe how awful people are... if you are allergic to a hornet sting, do they have to see you stung and then brought to and Emergency Room to ensure you can breathe?", "NTA\n\nYou tried explaining to them and they didn't listen. There's nothing rude about not wanting stomache acid pains and heart burn 24/7", "NTA this is incredibly messed up.  Your family are literally poisoning you.  The lack of empathy from your family is appalling.  If they're too boneheaded to get it through their brain's that you have a medical condition that prevents you from eating what they serve that's their problem.  Honestly don't know why you would want to attend events with these assholes if they're treating you like that.", "NTA.\n\nDo what you need to do to keep yourself healthy.\n\nIt's amazing, isn't it, how people try to shame you into eating stuff that will make you sick?

I have the same condition and when it flares up I feel like I\u2019ve been punched in the chest with fire. Fortunately the OTC medicine I take for it keeps it under control, along with watching what I eat. Sorry you have friends and family that don\u2019t care.", "NTA, but a GERD diet is not necessarily equivalent to a 5yo kid's. So if your choice of foods seems similar to a toddler's then comments about \"growing out of picky eating\" will likely continue. \n\nIf you haven't already worked with a nutritionist then you should.\n\nAs for holidays, bringing your own meal when you have dietary concerns is a pretty normal thing.", "NTA. You are being completely reasonable in a family of unreasonable people. You have a medical condition, but your family chooses to either forget about it, ignore it, or not believe you.

I think messing with peoples food is cruel and in some instances illegal.", "NTA here, but i'm confused that you are saying a GERD diet is equivalent to a 5 year olds.  GERD is a common issue, 20% of adults in the US are diagnosed with it, myself included.  it's so common that I'm betting some of your relatives have it too.  i have never met another person who has GERD who isn't capable of eating at holiday dinners.  you could have other issues going on which would be why you appear to have further restrictions.  have you been evaluated since you were 5?", "NTA.
