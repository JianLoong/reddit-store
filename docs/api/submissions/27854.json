In fact, you are now a part of the problem. \n\nYTA", "YTA You concern is understandable, but the way to handled it is pretty controlling and out of line. If you're concerned this is contributing to her ill health, you need to sit down and have a discussion about it so that you can come to an agreement about what is best for your family. Ultimately, if it's not affecting you or your family, the relationship is hers to manage and it should be her decision about how much she wants to give and how she wants to spend her time. You can teach her to stand up for herself by supporting her decisions instead of undermining them.", "This is a hard one. As someone who has a complicated relationship with family (I went no contact with my parents last week after they broke the final straw) it took me decades to realize they were extremely toxic. Meanwhile my husband is being mean telling me to cut them out and how horrible they were all this time. I was mad at him. I was hurt by his actions. It caused a divide in some areas of our marriage. How dare he tell me the people who loved me and raised me to be the woman he loves\u2026how dare he claim they were toxic!!!! Well\u2026being with him for 15 years and having moved away from them and not seeing them a ton like I had prior\u2026things started to come to light. They do value my sister as an equal adult. They still see me as a child they should control. They are breaking rules put in place for the health and safety of our children. They are telling our children to keep secrets and not tell us things bc they know they are breaking the rules. Crap\u2026they really are toxic. Oh you want to lie\u2026let\u2019s do a time out.

Sometimes they called him when they almost done eating and when he arrived he can only have a few bites of leftover but still paid for everything.

It was fine when they would watch my kids too if I asked because it was like paying back in kind type of deal, but they started saying no a lot more or agreeing and then at the eleventh hour suddenly forget even though i repeatedly reminded them of the day a week prior, 2 weeks prior, initially asked 3 months prior and we talked about how excited the kids were for it during that time period. I even texted her saying i had bought a dress i really like for this event i was going to, bought the tickets and booked the transport and that i was really excited as it was our first date night out since having our 4th kid (during covid so everything was on lockdown). But she conveniently forgot and had gone to a wedding instead. So, in the end, we stopped asking. But they kept on asking us to watch her kids. As much as I love my nephews and don't really mind general messes they might make like dishes if I've fed them, it got to a point of they would go throughout the whole house and trash every room somehow, not help clean it up and waltz out the door leaving it for us to find at some point in the distant future. So parents weren't paying back in kind, nephews were trashing our house and I and my husband had to put a stop to it. Of course they can come visit but they have to go home at the end of the day. These aren't young kids either. They are 12 and 10, so they know full well that messes aren't good. Mess my own kids make is mine and my husband's responsibility to clean and they are younger, just starting school and toddlers, but a 12 and 10 year old should know better than to trash someone else's house. It's not acceptable in their own home, and they have this notion that it is acceptable in ours when it's not. \n\nI do think you handled this all wrong OP.

Tell the sisters that if they need a babysitter they need to pay for one and not always ask your wife, her health is declining and you need her to focus on getting better, whatever the reason is.

And obviously wife\u2019s family needed therapy years ago. Why don\u2019t her parents intervene? But now this is your problem. The SIL\u2019s are imposing on you and your wife - they have no boundaries and apparently emotionally abuse your wife which is understandably maddening to you. They also seem to be negligent parents in regards to their own kids. You both should seek some therapy together to discuss how the in-laws are effecting you and her, and dig down deep into what your wife\u2019s past and current relationship are with her sisters, and parents. She needs an outsider to help her understand why she puts up with abuse from her sisters/family. Is her need to constantly be the kids\u2019 caretaker a way for her to gain acceptance from family that is not going to come? Could therapy help her to find ways to advocate for herself, discuss problems? Is there a reason you don\u2019t openly advocate for her during these family events? Or have a sit-down discussion with her to go over what you are observing and feeling? Your feelings count too, but you have to express them. Can you just meet sisters privately and have a discussion with them on what you are observing regarding their behavior? And maybe talk to your wife on how you want to call them out on their snarky/negligent behavior from now on - and then follow through and do it by stating calmly your observations about how they are behaving and how it makes you and your wife feel (you can review scenarios with a therapist and practice what you can say, ie; \u201cWhen you  say that, I feel you are disrespecting my wife and not appreciating the effort she makes to accommodate your needs; I also feel concerned that you are jeopardizing my wife\u2019s job and your kids needs are not being served by sitting quietly at her workplace.

You sound as if have been in a relationship for a while but no children? I would wager a guess at how much your wife wishes to be around her nieces and nephews this was not a conscious decision and that having a baby wasn\u2019t in the cards for your wife or you have imposed it upon her. Either way I have a feeling she is filling the void of not having children of her own with her nieces and nephews. Nothing wrong with that, it takes a village and the more people in children\u2019s lives that love them the better and no doubt helps her as well. But it is worrying that she is will to risk things like her business (kids in a salon environment could put of clients), and her health because of it. And her sisters are showing disrespect by letting her do it. As women they are probably completely aware of her vulnerability when it comes to children and take advantage of the situation.\n\nThis being said YTA for how you handled the situation. You have no right to make decisions on how much she wishes to be involved in her nieces and nephews life and you literally blocking to door against your wife\u2019s wishes is extremely toxic no matter how legitimate your concerns were.\n\nWhat you need to do is talk to your wife about setting boundaries. Stress that having a relationship with her nieces and nephews is a wonderful thing you want to support but there has to be some limits. It\u2019s your house too and although you don\u2019t mind having them around there are times where just dropping them off with little or no notice is not appropriate. Also stress that she needs to look to her own needs at the moment and although some time with the kids may lift her spirits too much will drain her so a balance needs to be had. Doing what you are doing will only alienate your wife and the children will also pick up on your energy and feel unwanted even though they are innocent in all this. \n\nYour wife may find some counselling to get a objective perspective on the situation.", "YTA- you are right, but it\u2019s for her to decide, not you.", "NTA....This is OP's home too.
