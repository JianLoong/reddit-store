This was 2 days in a row.\n\nYou need to respect your wife's judgment. If you disagree, you need to sit down and have a discussion about it and come to a decision together. Reactively taking control of a situation is simply controlling behavior and is not a good solution to this problem. In fact, you are now a part of the problem. \n\nYTA", "YTA You concern is understandable, but the way to handled it is pretty controlling and out of line. If you're concerned this is contributing to her ill health, you need to sit down and have a discussion about it so that you can come to an agreement about what is best for your family. Ultimately, if it's not affecting you or your family, the relationship is hers to manage and it should be her decision about how much she wants to give and how she wants to spend her time. You can teach her to stand up for herself by supporting her decisions instead of undermining them.", "This is a hard one. As someone who has a complicated relationship with family (I went no contact with my parents last week after they broke the final straw) it took me decades to realize they were extremely toxic. Meanwhile my husband is being mean telling me to cut them out and how horrible they were all this time. I was mad at him. I was hurt by his actions. It caused a divide in some areas of our marriage. How dare he tell me the people who loved me and raised me to be the woman he loves\u2026how dare he claim they were toxic!!!! Well\u2026being with him for 15 years and having moved away from them and not seeing them a ton like I had prior\u2026things started to come to light. They do value my sister as an equal adult. They still see me as a child they should control. They are breaking rules put in place for the health and safety of our children. They are telling our children to keep secrets and not tell us things bc they know they are breaking the rules. Crap\u2026they really are toxic. Oh you want to lie\u2026let\u2019s do a time out.  Now you\u2019re harassing other people trying to get information about my family? No problem\u2026we are now NC and will remain that way. I didn\u2019t see the toxic behaviors until I was removed from them. Meanwhile my husband was the bad guy bc he was telling the truth I was too blind to see. Nta but your wife needs therapy to learn what a healthy relationship is and what a toxic one is.", "YTA.\n\nThis is your wife\u2019s decision, not yours. Blocking the door & refusing entry against her wishes for 2 days in a row sounds extremely controlling. If you have a problem with what\u2019s happening, talk to her, but your actions are not appropriate nor are they a solution.", "YTA\u2014you may right but this isn\u2019t your decision. If your wife wants to babysit for her sisters, she\u2019s entitled to do that. Now, you could have a conversation with her and point out your concerns, but physically blocking the door is totally inappropriate.", "NTA< your wife is wanting to watch the kids and that is fine but you are also helping in watching those kids and you were not asked. \n\nI get that the kids don't need to suffer what the mom does but that behavior is extreme. \n\nYou need to sit your wife down and let her know that if she wants to continue to watch the kids you will not stop her but it will not be in your home because unless you both decide it is okay, then she needs to go to their house and she can watch them all she wants. \n\nI assume that you help her and that is why she doesn't mind but if you remove the extra help then maybe she can see that her health is more important than what her sister is doing to her regarding using those kids to get what she wants.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is off work with health issues and looking after children isn't resting. \n\nIt's making you the bad guy who says no, as she doesn't seem to be able to.\n\nYou do need to have a conversation about this issue though.", "YTA  \nI appreciate that you have good intentions and care about your wife. I think you need to talk to your wife about why you think she should stop babysitting (or enforces rules regarding it) rather than making the decision for her. She is an adult and can make the decision for herself.", "ESH-there should be an agreement when it comes to the children being in your home.", "ESH. Babysitting the kids impacts your life. She shouldn't be doing it without talking to you.\n\nThat being said you shouldn't have just turned them away. You both need to have an actual adult conversation.", "NAH\n\nYour wife is a people-pleaser and her sisters are taking advantage of her. They bring their kids to her work seriously ? Who does that ? She has to take care of the kids while she's sick ?\n\nYour gesture of blocking the door is extreme. But I'm not going to blame you, you were protecting your wife. Try to have a calm discussion with her to explain that her health comes before babysitting.\n\nChances are she won't listen, in which case let her make her own decisions. She's a grown-up, and you can't infintilize her, even if she makes the wrong choices. Suggest her therapy.", "NTA", "YTA\nYour wife needs to be the person who decides if this keeps going or not. These kids are her family, and even if she may have a bad relationship with her sisters she has every right to be attached to their kids. You can't choose if your wife gets to have contact with her family", "I 100% get that you think they're taking advantage of your wife... BUT... maybe she's playing the long game, getting her terrible sister's kids to like her more than they like their own mothers.", "YTA for taking this to the children instead of talking with your wife about what her sisters are doing to ya'll's house and life. You're not wrong to be mad about this, but you're not being a good partner, here.", "Oof. I understand your frustration. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already talked to her about it. If you haven\u2019t, do that immediately. I know if it was my house and my husband\u2019s sibling dropped their kids off, I would lose my shit. Kids are loud and disruptive and they get into everything so yeah you\u2019re definitely being impacted by your wife\u2019s decisions. You should not have blocked the door though, that\u2019s super controlling. At this point, I would tell your wife she can only babysit the kids if it\u2019s not in your house or when you\u2019re not home. \n\nESH", "YTA, your wife wants to spend time with her nieces and nephews.  It's her decision to make, not yours.", "Clear YTA. Physically preventing your wife from even opening the door? I'm reminded of how children stand in front of someone with their arms wide to try and stop someone. Grow up.\n\nIf you want your wife to babysit less, use your words like a big boy. Talk to her about how often she sits for them, how much it seems like she's willing to go out of her way to keep her siblings happy, etc. but you need to respect that if your wife wants to babysit, that's her choice.", "YTA. your wife is mad at you, so why do you really need to ask? if the kids can be trusted to hang out in a salon while shes working, they can be trusted to hang out at the house while shes managing her health issues.", "YTA. Actually, I understand why you\u2019re frustrated because you guys are getting her kids more often than you\u2019d like.\nBut as an aunt of young kids, that also has a sister I don\u2019t get along with, the kids aren\u2019t the problem. I\u2019m very close with my nieces and nephews, so Im not entirely sure what her relationship is like with hers. But I\u2019ve always told them that they can come over whenever they want. I\u2019d rather those kids be with me, safely, than whoever else my sister can find. \nPlease don\u2019t let the mistakes of the mother fall upon the kids \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Tell your wife that you love her and can't stand to see her mistreated and used and it's time to set boundaries 1. She will not babysit when she is at work and if they drop the kids off at her work the police will be immediately called for child abandonment 2. You will babysit 1 time a month for no more than 2hrs for free 3. They will treat you both with respect, politeness, and civility.", "It\u2019s tough when you see someone you love being abused, but it\u2019s your wife\u2019s decision to end the abuse.

She never asked you to do it, so blocking at the door is not giving her agency for her decisions.  I would let her have her time bonding with them and go out and do something on my own.  Have some \"me time\" while she's having bonding time.  Let her take care of the children and their messes on her own.\n\nNow she is a jerk for agreeing to babysit in your shared house without checking to see if this is ok with you first.  What if you had plans that day and now they are derailed because there are children there?  She is inconsiderate of your shared space.\n\nNow if she gets mad at you because she wants you to help watch the kids because of her health, but did not even ask you if that was something you could do.
