In fact, you are now a part of the problem. \n\nYTA", "YTA You concern is understandable, but the way to handled it is pretty controlling and out of line. If you're concerned this is contributing to her ill health, you need to sit down and have a discussion about it so that you can come to an agreement about what is best for your family. Ultimately, if it's not affecting you or your family, the relationship is hers to manage and it should be her decision about how much she wants to give and how she wants to spend her time. You can teach her to stand up for herself by supporting her decisions instead of undermining them.", "This is a hard one. As someone who has a complicated relationship with family (I went no contact with my parents last week after they broke the final straw) it took me decades to realize they were extremely toxic. Meanwhile my husband is being mean telling me to cut them out and how horrible they were all this time. I was mad at him. I was hurt by his actions. It caused a divide in some areas of our marriage. How dare he tell me the people who loved me and raised me to be the woman he loves\u2026how dare he claim they were toxic!!!! Well\u2026being with him for 15 years and having moved away from them and not seeing them a ton like I had prior\u2026things started to come to light. They do value my sister as an equal adult. They still see me as a child they should control. They are breaking rules put in place for the health and safety of our children. They are telling our children to keep secrets and not tell us things bc they know they are breaking the rules. Crap\u2026they really are toxic. Oh you want to lie\u2026let\u2019s do a time out.

It was fine when they would watch my kids too if I asked because it was like paying back in kind type of deal, but they started saying no a lot more or agreeing and then at the eleventh hour suddenly forget even though i repeatedly reminded them of the day a week prior, 2 weeks prior, initially asked 3 months prior and we talked about how excited the kids were for it during that time period. I even texted her saying i had bought a dress i really like for this event i was going to, bought the tickets and booked the transport and that i was really excited as it was our first date night out since having our 4th kid (during covid so everything was on lockdown). But she conveniently forgot and had gone to a wedding instead. So, in the end, we stopped asking. But they kept on asking us to watch her kids. As much as I love my nephews and don't really mind general messes they might make like dishes if I've fed them, it got to a point of they would go throughout the whole house and trash every room somehow, not help clean it up and waltz out the door leaving it for us to find at some point in the distant future. So parents weren't paying back in kind, nephews were trashing our house and I and my husband had to put a stop to it. Of course they can come visit but they have to go home at the end of the day. These aren't young kids either. They are 12 and 10, so they know full well that messes aren't good. Mess my own kids make is mine and my husband's responsibility to clean and they are younger, just starting school and toddlers, but a 12 and 10 year old should know better than to trash someone else's house. It's not acceptable in their own home, and they have this notion that it is acceptable in ours when it's not. \n\nI do think you handled this all wrong OP. There are other ways to convey your concern for your wife. Also you need to talk to your wife about this because at the end of the day it's a problem you have to both find a solution to. Suggest that the kids can visit with their parents but cannot stay over and have to leave when their parents leave. Tell the sisters that if they need a babysitter they need to pay for one and not always ask your wife, her health is declining and you need her to focus on getting better, whatever the reason is. They may have got the gist when you denied them entry but you should have made it clear before they even made the journey, when they ask, you or your wife tell them no you can babysit for them. No reason needed, you just can do it.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t let her? Let her? \n\nWhat does SHE want? It sounds like she wants to spend time with her sisters\u2019 children.
