Basically every day my SIL, Theresa and SILs daughter \"Abby\" are at my house and they always bring their dog with them. It's some sort of Chihuahua. I enjoy their company for the most part but Theresa is starting to really piss me off with her attitude problem. \n\nSo basically I will be asked to bring Theresa to work most days and I will because it's right down the street but I don't even get so much as a thank you from her. Nothing. No offer of gas money either. Or she will sit at my table making sarcastic remarks to whatever me and my SIL are talking about. But the biggest issue of all is her shutting my doors and passive aggressively saying \"Yeah don't worry, I will shut it\" after I've specifically said to leave my fucking doors open, multiple times. I like natural air. I keep my doors open. \n\nSo I was standing at the back of my couch today and I had both my back and front doors open. She comes in and slams the door and says \"This door needs to stay shut because my dog keeps running out\". I immediately snapped. I whipped my door open and told her if she touches my door again than she wouldn't be welcome back here. Her dog escaping is not my fucking problem. She comes back with \"She will run away\" and I told her I didn't care if her dog ran away. It's still not my problem. Train it or keep it on a leash but don't touch my door. She took her dog and started walking home crying. \n\nMy SIL called me later on stating that while she understood why I reacted like that, she still feels I was \"too harsh\" because Theresa is depressed and this dog is basically the only thing keeping her going and that I genuinely hurt this girls feelings by saying I didn't care if her dog ran away because now she's overthinking it.
