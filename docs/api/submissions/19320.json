Basically every day my SIL, Theresa and SILs daughter \"Abby\" are at my house and they always bring their dog with them. It's some sort of Chihuahua. I enjoy their company for the most part but Theresa is starting to really piss me off with her attitude problem. \n\nSo basically I will be asked to bring Theresa to work most days and I will because it's right down the street but I don't even get so much as a thank you from her. Nothing. No offer of gas money either. Or she will sit at my table making sarcastic remarks to whatever me and my SIL are talking about. But the biggest issue of all is her shutting my doors and passive aggressively saying \"Yeah don't worry, I will shut it\" after I've specifically said to leave my fucking doors open, multiple times. I like natural air. I keep my doors open. \n\nSo I was standing at the back of my couch today and I had both my back and front doors open. She comes in and slams the door and says \"This door needs to stay shut because my dog keeps running out\". I immediately snapped. I whipped my door open and told her if she touches my door again than she wouldn't be welcome back here. Her dog escaping is not my fucking problem. She comes back with \"She will run away\" and I told her I didn't care if her dog ran away. It's still not my problem. Train it or keep it on a leash but don't touch my door. She took her dog and started walking home crying. \n\nMy SIL called me later on stating that while she understood why I reacted like that, she still feels I was \"too harsh\" because Theresa is depressed and this dog is basically the only thing keeping her going and that I genuinely hurt this girls feelings by saying I didn't care if her dog ran away because now she's overthinking it. I guess I still fail to see how that's my problem.", "created_utc": 1686256218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144k63e/aita_for_telling_my_sils_step_kid_that_i_didnt/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she's a guest who isn't polite.\n\nWould you let her put a barrier at the door that will block the Chihuahua but let air flow?", "NTA- tell SIL- nope- she had a chance to let it go down easy but she argued with me in my own house and I'm not having it. The gentle words didn't work, so I had to go back and get some harsher ones until they did. Now she understands, but it's her own fault it got to that point. Next time, hear me the first time and that'll be the end of it. While we're at it, better teach her to start saying thank you or she can start walking her ass to work.", "NTA. You were quite harsh though. There is no reason a 22 year old can't have her dog on a leash while visiting. Her depression (if true) is not a reason for your SIL to try to manipulate you.\n\nIt would benefit everyone to take a step back from this daily relationship. Stop driving Theresa to work. Ask her to stop with the sarcastic comments.\n\nIt seems like you held too much in and then snapped.", "NTA\n\nShe's literally being a sarcastic dick who keeps disregarding your wishes.

Or place the dog in a cage or something or put it on a leash and have someone hold it.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house so it's your rules.

She can take her rude self and dog home or keep it on a leash.", "NTA - this is your home and they are guests. They do not have to bring a dog into your home if they don't feel like it is appropriate for the dog.", "NTA,  the young woman with the dog, needs to learn to train that dog, and if she cannot, then she should get the poor pup re-homed to someone who can train and respect it.", "NTA\n\nYou made yourself clear about the doors, and Theresa is old enough to know how to keep her dog secured.", "NTA  your house ur rules. if she cant listen to it then she shouldnt come. im surprised how much patience you have with that piece of shi.

If she doesn't want her dog to run away then she needs to keep the dog and her attitude at her own home.", "NTA.  Being depressed doesn't give you a right to be rude.", "NTA - Theresa is 22 and doesn't understand about dogs, training, and a leash?  Really not your problem.  Open your doors and let them take care of their own dog. Maybe they will get mad and leave you alone.  That sounds like a win-win to me.", "NTA\n\nShe is a guest.  She's lucky you allow her to bring her dog to your house at all.  If her dog needs accommodations in your house to keep it safe, it's on HER to set those up.  You are not a doggy daycare.  \n\nShe can leash the dog, bring a baby gate, or leave the dog at her house where the doors will be shut.  In YOUR house, the doors remain open, and it's on her as the dog's owner to make sure her dog is secured even with open doors.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. She's being disrespectful. She should've kept her dog on a leash or chained in the house.", "ESH. There are so many options here. You can *calmly* point out that you're letting her bring her dog to your home, but your home stays the way it is. She has the option to bring a baby gate to block the front door, or not bring her dog over. She doesn't have the option to be aggressive with you.\n\nYour SIL could also help her sort out these choices instead of expecting you to handle it. Same with the drives to work - if she wants you to help her daughter, she can arrange pay and thanks. Yes, 22 is an adult, but SIL is there and watching these interactions fail and she is not an innocent bystander.\n\nAnd you don't have to sound heartless about the idea of someone's beloved pet getting lost or hurt.\n\nEDIT: And there is absolutely nothing wrong with your desire to have doors and windows open. Your home, your choice.", "INFO Why do you allow her to treat you like shit? Why even have her over?", "Do you now have windows you can keep open? Considering it's a Chihuahua I don't think it could escape if you keep the windows open. I think would be a good compromise.", "ESH. Sounds like you all have issues and zero communication skills and super unhealthy relationships.", "ESH. She's ungrateful, but you're a complete asshole.

But it sounds like you didn't really lay down the law in regards to the dog coming over.\n\nAnd considering how much this dog means to Theresa, when you say something like, \"I don't care if it dies,\" to Theresa, that can sound an awful lot like, \"I don't care if YOU die.\" Or at the very least, \"I don't care about your anguish or your struggles.
