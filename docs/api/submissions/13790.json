Basically we were all asked us to purchase specific alcohol so their wedding bar is stocked.) We were also told it was a luau themed party and encouraged people to dress up because there was a costume/outfit contest. Weeks prior to the party, I told my boyfriend that I was going to order a custom white tank top that just said \u201cluau\u201d in black on it. My boyfriend and I thought it was funny.\n\nWe arrived at the party and everyone loved my tank top. I was actually surprised how much attention the tank top was getting. Then our mutual friend \u201cRachel\u201d arrived in this beautiful Hawaiian dress, her hair all done up, and etc. Rachel always wins these types of contests because the level of effort she takes. She takes these very seriously. Rachel began getting the same level of attention (deservingly so). 30 minutes later, Amy asked for anyone who wanted to participate in the costume contest to line up to determine who had the best outfit. \n\nI originally didn\u2019t want to participate, but my boyfriend nudged me into it. So I joined about 6 other people including Rachel. After voting, I was declared the winner. I looked at Rachel and she looked annoyed. Throughout the party, I heard that she kept bitching about my tank top and how lazy it was.\n\nOnce the party ended, Rachel came up to me and said I was an asshole for winning with a low effort tank top. I reminded her the theme was luau, the tank top literally had the theme on it, and it was a popular vote. She became angrier and said I should apologize and accused me of mocking her. I told her she was taking this a bit too seriously. I refuse to apologize for her.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1680404353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1297wjy/aita_for_winning_a_costume_contest_that_i_put_no/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s a fun activity, not a race to win the crown.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s just a sore loser. You didn\u2019t ask to win, it was a vote and you won. She can\u2019t win every time.\n\nI think she was really out of line for the things she said and instead of you apologizing to her for something you didn\u2019t do, she should apologize to you for saying those things.", "NTA guess Rachel should have tried harder", "NTA I've been to plenty of costume contests in my life and sometimes it's not the best costumes that wins it's one but the one that leaves the biggest impression. Sorry, not sorry, she came expecting to win not to enjoy the party.", "NTA but Rachel is an AH and bad loser. It was a popular vote so maybe she should consider that. Perhaps everyone is tired of her over the top choices, or thought your tee was fab, or just thought someone other than Rachel should win. Ignore her, or just smile if she brings it up. Geeze, it was a frigging homegrown costume contest!", "I would be the Rachel here because I put a lot of work into costumes and I'd be super pissed if you won over me and I'd probably be thinking the same thing.\n\nThat said, it was a popular vote, so technically not your fault. Rachel should have probably kept her mouth shut even if she's thinking that stuff, which I certainly have done when I've lost certain contests. Sometimes the humor costume wins and that's all there is to it.", "NTA- you win some, you lose some. Sometimes you win unintentionally, or lose despite your very best effort. Rachel\u2019s disappointment is her problem.", "She's a cry baby and you're NTA. Expecting an apology for something that you actually had no influence on. You didn't force anyone's vote. She's a sore loser.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s a sore loser. She\u2019ll get over it (I hope).", "NTA. There wasn\u2019t a damn panel of judges professionally judging y\u2019all based on a point system of authenticity, creativity, effort, my lord. This was a \u2018popular opinion\u2019 vote. Not your fault people liked your outfit better than hers Regardless of the amount of effort \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she\u2019s a sore loser and needs to learn to chill.", "Sometimes simple works. Rachel needs to chill. NTA", "NTA.  Rachel sounds like a sore loser.  Often sore losers are ungracious winners.  Is that the case with her?  Because if it is, then I would guess that people voted for you because they didn't want her to win.", "NTA. You didn't vote or tell anyone how to vote. Sometimes clever wins\n\nNicely done, OP.", "NAH. Putting in a ton of effort only to have someone who by their own admission put in near zero effort in has got to be frustrating, but at the same time it's a popular vote, you can absolutely be best in show and still lose those.", "NTA \n\n>   Rachel always wins these types of contests because the level of effort she takes\n\nEveryone here obviously voting for your low effort as a jab and an eye roll to her as, girl, stop taking this shit so seriously", "NTA\n\nSounds like a sore loser, petty type of person who throws a fit when she doesn't get her way. It's not your fault  that the people who voted for the costume contest liked your outfit better. There's no need for you to apologize to her; it sounds like she should be the one apologizing to you for her snippy remark.", "NTA. I once went to a party that was period costume themed. We were pretty broke at the time but I rented my partner a 1950\u2019s style white suit and Panama hat, and I sewed myself a dress from at pattern of my grandmother\u2019s from the same era, and did 1950\u2019s makeup. We  went as Cubanos from before Castro. I got a lot of dirty looks from people who thought our costumes were too current.", "Nta", "NTA.

But, even if they did, that\u2019s on the people who voted, not you for going the comedy route.", "Rachel needs to calm down. She\u2019s too wind up!!!  You did nothing wrong.", "I think it\u2019s great that you won w/something tongue-in-cheek. If I had to guess I say your other friends are tired of Rachel winning all the time.", "I'm also a \"Rachel\" in that I put 100% effort into themed things. That said, I know that the fun in these types of contest diminishes a lot when the same person wins every single time! If you get a little streak going, okay. But  it's perfectly fine to also show up in your best, enjoy the compliments, and sit out so others get a chance and turn. Throwing a fit because you feel cheated by the popular vote and someone in a bought, simpler, or less creative in your opinion cos screams insecurity and the need to be an attention vampire.", "A lot of people don't consider that there was a different life style closer to what was modern att before dictators step in. My T\u00eda had a lot of pictures of her time in Cuba before Castro and she had to leave behind her family and all her beautiful clothes and her beloved car.\n\nI had a friend who's mother fled from the Middle East, but was there as a young woman in the late 60's early 70's. We had an assignment where we were supposed to dress as our parents did when they were the same age. And bring in photos. Our teacher legit lost their crap on her because she showed up with Ferrah hair, high waisted bell bottoms jeans, wood wedges, and a body fitting long sleeve wild paisley blouse instead of a burka(is that how it's spelled?) These were the same clothes and hair style her mom was wearing in her photo! Where her mom's friends were dressed just as modern for that time. \n\nBut Ms.B just refused to accept her views were skewed. A lot of people are foolish that way, and it sucks because it's just one more way those who come from places where terrible regimes take over, lose their history and are more erased.\n\nI bet you and your partner were absolutely beautiful and stunning at that party. It's plain sorry others had to be narrow minded snobs about your dressings."]}
