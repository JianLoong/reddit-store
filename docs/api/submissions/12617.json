My husband, medical professionals, and daycare are all that know and someone other than my husband let it slip.\nMy mom immediately calls and tells me that she knows our secret. I understand that she did not ask to be told and that\u2019s not her fault. She starts pushing for information.

I again tell her this isn\u2019t information that she is supposed to have and it\u2019s not up for discussion. She pushes two more times and I remind her that when I was pregnant with my first she tried to give my husband and I a list of names that we were allowed to choose from. Aside from being overbearing we already had one picked out. She just didn\u2019t like it and wanted a say in it. We also ran into some bad complications last time. We shared the information with my parents as they were nice enough to give my husband a ride to the hospital (he was too worried to drive himself there and I went by ambulance). We explained that we did not want anyone else to know until we had more answers, she posted about it on facebook and said she had rights as a grandmother that needed to be comforted. Because of this I wasn\u2019t open to talking with her about it. She ran from my house in tears. \nMy husband understands my being upset but thinks it\u2019s great that she cares. I really don\u2019t have anyone else that I can ask if I\u2019m the one at fault as we haven\u2019t shared the news with anyone yet. AITA for not wanting to share any information with my mother about my pregnancy?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your kind words and the peace of mind you\u2019ve given me.

This is one of those  \"play around and find out\" moments. She played - violated your boundaries - last time and now she's going to find out that you're not going to trust her this time. Simple as that.   \n\n\nThe fact that you are feeling guilty about this suggests that there's a long history of emotional violation on the part of your mom. That guilt isn't, as far as I can tell, really telling you that you're doing something unethical here. It's just a trauma reaction. It's what you had to do as a child to stay safe. Probably ditto for your husband. We do tend to marry people with familiar patterns.", "NTA  and I would encourage you to read the  book  \"Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents \". I suspect you'll find it helpful.", "NTA You have very good reasons to share nothing with your mother. She knows she\u2019s not trustworthy. She\u2019s just upset that you know it, too.", "NTA. Based on what you've shared, it seems like your relationship with your mom is about as pleasant as a root canal. And honestly, I don't blame you for not wanting to spill the beans about your pregnancy - given your mom's past behavior during your first pregnancy, she's about as trustworthy as a used car salesman.\r  \n\r  \nYou've clearly communicated to your mom that you're not interested in discussing your pregnancy with her right now, but she's still pushing for details like a thirsty ex on Instagram. That's not cool, and it's totally understandable that you're feeling frustrated and uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nIt's great that your husband is supportive, but he might need a little help understanding where you're coming from. I mean, sure, your mom's behavior might seem caring on the surface, but it's like putting a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound - it's not really addressing the underlying issues.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, I think you're making the right call in keeping your pregnancy on the DL for now. You deserve to protect your boundaries and privacy, and nobody - not even your mom - has the right to pressure you into sharing personal information. Stay strong, girl!", "NTA. You have every right to set your boundaries, even with your parents.\nIt\u2019s certainly sad that the situation ended with her leaving in tears, and I hope the two of you can reconcile in the future. \nBut it sounds like it\u2019s best for you to keep her at an arm\u2019s distance for now, and that\u2019s okay.", ">My husband, medical professionals, and daycare are all that know and someone other than my husband let it slip. \n\nINFO: How is that even possible? If you and your mother have such a contentious relationship, how would she in any way be coming into contact with your daycare? And a doctor is bound by confidentiality rules.", "Does she care or does she just want info that she can then use to get sympathy/likes? NTA", "NTA, she's making this pregnancy about her and it's not. Yes it's nice that she cares, but that doesn't allow her to overstep the boundaries you've stated over and over.   \nI'm sure you have good reasons to keep it from her, until you were ready to tell her. And her behaviour is only proving that you were right to do so.", "NTA, \n\nAs someone that has a very difficult relationship with my mother I can absolutely understand your need for boundaries.\n\nActions have consequences, and the way she acted towards you growing up, and during your first pregnancy we\u2019re the grounds to build the current relation you have. Don\u2019t feel guilty about taking care of yourself, and your baby, by imposing your boundaries and not sharing information.\n\nYou should take care of yourself and your mother should learn to respect that too. If she wants a healthy relationship with you and your family she needs to learn how to do it in your terms.\n\nGood luck with the new pregnancy OP!", "NTA. She doesn't \"care\". She wants attention and to control your pregnancy again. You need to tell your husband to let you deal with her. \n\nETA: I misread something, so I took off the wrong information (that the husband was the one who told the mom).", "What information are you trying to keep private? The due date? Your weight?\n\nYou wanted to announce the pregnancy on your schedule, but some third party spilled the secret and the basic fact that you are pregnant is out there.\n\nYWBTA if you try to pretend that your preganancy is still secret. The people you would have told at the planned time, know. If you insist on giving zero information, you will get push back from them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mother was one of the first ones to know about our first pregnancy. We asked her not to tell anyone, because we wanted to be the ones to tell the news.
