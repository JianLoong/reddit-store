I know that may sound harsh, but it's YOUR graduation. They have no right to force any guest onto your invite list, especially someone with whom you have a known contentious relationship with, regardless of the fact that it might be a family member.

Do not invite them - they will bring her with them to \"surprise\" you.", "NTA\n\nIf she hasn't attempted to mend fences, I'm surprised she'd accept the invite if things have been this cantankerous unless she was up to something.", "NTA- if you feel that strongly about it, no one should force it on you\u2026", "Personally I'd tell your parents you decided to do me a graduation party, but you have dictated who comes. This party is not for me but for you.\n\nIf you invite someone you know I don't get on with them I know it's definitely not for me. I would prefer to do something for myself and hang out with people that actually care and support me.\nMum, dad cancel the party and I will go out and hang with my friends and we will  have a great time. At least this way I will be around people that is not going to start drama and ruin what is supposed to be a happy time.", "NTA if your parents want to reconnect with your sister, they need to do that during a neutral time. *Your* celebration is extremely the wrong time to force it for so many reasons.\n\nCongrats on graduating!", "NTA, if you\u2019re fine with canceling it. Cancel it.", "NTA - you can nicely tell your parents that you are too old for that type of party and just have your friends meet you at the bar/club/where ever you like to hang out and celebrate the way you want to. That way you are not beholden to anyone.", "NTA  since you are ok with them canceling.\n\nCurious what the variety of reasons are though. Do you intend on never speaking to your sister again?

Since they're insisting thank them for the thought but please cancel it. Have dinner with your friends and have a good time. It's a shame your parents are ruining what should be a big day in your life but you can't control the behavior of others.

Be the bigger person and if she makes a scene then the whole family would see it and ask her to leave and you don\u2019t have to be the person to do it.

Inviting someone you most definitely do not want to see is simply rude.  Look, I understand your parents are probably quite upset by the estrangement between their kids. But a party is NOT the place to try and effect a reconciliation. Particularly as you apparently are not interested in do so.  You have told them that you would rather them cancel the party than have her attend. If they go ahead with it, she attends and the bad blood between you breaks into open conflict, well your parents have no one but themselves to blame. Stick to your guns and congratulations on your graduation.", "NTA. The party is to celebrate your accomplishment. You should be able to say who is invited, and who isn't.

It's a party for them to show off and brag about how well they've done as parents, and part of that is having all children there. Can't have people asking why one child is missing, might make them look bad.", "What an insane take. They are an adult and can choose not to be around someone. What their parents want is more important than what they want? At a party for THEM???They are all adults after all. The parents will get over it.
