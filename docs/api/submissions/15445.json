The whole \"you're a disappointment\" and \"I'm royally pissed off at you\" threats aren't worth dealing with him either. He's a control freak.\n\nIt's extremely disrespectful for someone to dismiss your feelings for any reason. If they keep pushing your peaceful boundaries, then those family members need boundaries, too. I'm currently not speaking to my father, and he's on his deathbed. But this is the road he wants to die on. He says he wants to be neutral, but i feel like he has already chosen a side. He is protecting an abusive narcissist because he's one too.\n\nStay strong.

If the party is at your parents' home, it is also her home so she will be there.", "IMO life's too short to spend it screaming at people. \n\nIt sucks that she's almost 30 and still behaving this way, but do you really want to let her control you? \nIn a comment you added she already boycotted you from a party for your nephew. Now there's your graduation party, with your grandparents and cousins etc. Does she get to control that too? These are moments that never come back ime.\n\nWould you be able to... just celebrate with the people you do enjoy? Especially if it's a sizeable party, you might just be able to avoid her entirely!\nIf she starts something, she'll only put mud on her own face. Shine bright like a diamond with your accomplishment, and let her choke on your joy.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nMake your own plans. Treat yourself to a relaxing spa time or go party with friends after graduation. Do whatever you are into to celebrate your accomplishment.", "Don't go to the party. If they want her there fine but you will not be. After graduation go out and do something great for yourself while they all stand around waiting for the guest of honor. Simple", "NTA. You did the right thing. You expressed yourself and you stood your ground. You have healthy boundaries and you have a plan for people who overstep them. Proud of you for being more mature than your parents.", "NTA. What's the reason for the estrangement?", "So according to your parents, it's ok for your estranged sister to insist you can't be invited to a significant family event she isn't throwing, and has nothing to do with her.  But you aren't allowed to say she can't be invited to a party about you?\n\nI'm sorry, but your parents are not treating you equally.", "NTA my parents are like this with my sister. I still have scars from her assaulting me last year out of the blue for an off-hand comment I\u2019d made (it was actually about a previous assault from her which she was in denial about). My birthday was soon after, I was holding it at another house, my parents weren\u2019t contributing anything yet when I said I don\u2019t feel comfortable them bringing her they went nuclear then all three refused to come! \n\nI repaired the relationship with my sister a bit after that. I felt very sorry for her. She\u2019s had lots of problems with drugs. But then she went back to her ex and got more into the drug scene and is actively trying to get pregnant again. I wanted to go NC with her. I\u2019m expecting another child and my first is getting older. However, if anyone in our family hints they don\u2019t want her around she gets my parents on side and they go crazy and bully or sneak her to events. I\u2019ve been pretending to want her to come to things this is the only way to guarantee she\u2019ll flake and not show up. \n\nI\u2019m also starting to plan ahead to things so that I don\u2019t have to be around her or my parents. They\u2019re all pretty toxic.", "Congratulations on your achievement and all your future successes!\n\nLet them cancel the party. \n\nIs it possible your sister won\u2019t bother to go anyway? \n\nI have family members I am estranged from and if my parents threw a party in my honor and insisted they invite the family I do not associate with I wouldn\u2019t show up. \n\nNTA and your folks need to learn to honor your boundaries.", "NTA", "This is the way\n\nI hate to mention this, but if your parents were ok with this, then it appears to me that they have chosen sides. I hope I\u2019m wrong though. \n\nGood luck and congrats. I\u2019d crash your graduation party. \ud83d\ude01", "First of all NTA. But please can you tell us why you are estranged? I\u2019m just here for the drama", "That sounds so sad. I am so sorry. You deserve to really celebrate! \n\nCongratulations on your graduation! I hope you throw yourself a huge celebration!", "Do it, and enjoy your peace.  NTA", "Ohhhh heck no. You definitely need to have a separate function and I wouldn't invite the older sister either.", "Don't cancel, tell them she can come then just forget to show up.", "Good call.", "Nothing wrong with never speaking to her and many people don't reconcile at funerals either. Some people value peace. Family or not. Just because its family you don't have to have them in your life.", "Nope. It's her moment and to be spoiled by her sister is better to not have any moment.", "But she can decide who goes to her party.", "This is you need to keep in mind, OP! This isn't your party, so don't feel bad about having them cancel THEIR party.", "Which is why it would be fuckin hysterical if OP just didn\u2019t show up.", "Sister is 30 and still at home.", "This.", "Damn that's so true it hurts.", "Yeah, people try it, but you can't force reconciliation. An aunt grabbed my arm at my father's memorial service and told me I wanted to hug my estranged sister. I just pulled my arm away and said \"no, I don't.\" I don't blame my aunt for wanting family to reconcile, and she doesn't know my oldest sister like I do. But there's no way in hell I'm having that bitch back in my life.", "Damn", "I was pretty much thinking this... \n\nIf the goal is looking like happy families then they're already being bad parents. Some families get along great, others have individuals who are lovely, but just don't get along, others have straight up AH's that just ruin everything. \n\nA good parent would support both of them while recognizing \"wow these people just dont get on\", there are better ways to try and get them to reconcile that actually stand a chance of working, dragging a member of the family to an event that OP doesn't get on with is just insane.\n\nIf at the end of the day OP really doesn't want this person here, and they're threatening to cancel the event then id go as far as saying they're failing as parents purely because they arent supporting both sides.. They're picking a side, and it clearly isnt OP's.", "In public though? Seems ill advised \ud83d\ude02", "It would depend on whose funeral it is.", "That sounds effective and comical! Take my poor mans gold \ud83c\udfc6", "Very well put.", "I really want to elope for that reason.", "I got married in a National Park with my inlaws, and my sister.  My sister knew better to tell my parents until after the wedding.", "Its not reasonable when its HER party. HER celebration and should be HER guest list. The parents were fine with her older sister not inviting OP to nephew's event.  Her parents are taking sides."]}
