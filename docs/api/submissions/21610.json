My husband and I have been looking for a sitter who will be able to watch our youngest 3 while we go. My husband ended up telling my MIL about us looking for a sitter and she and my FIL offered to watch the kids while we went.\n\nI told my husband I was hesitant about her watching the kids after what happened when she was watching the older two for the first/only time.

But has since stopped.\n\nYesterday I decided I wasn't at all comfortable with them watching the kids. And politely thanked my MIL for the offer and told her we already have a sitter lined up (We do). My MIL pressed me about it and kept asking why I would want to pay someone when she can do it for free and asking if I was lying to her.\n\nAfter many texts and calls, I got fed up and told her truthfully I don't trust her around my kids at all and that she's irresponsible, that I don't feel safe leaving my kids in her care, and that sea otters take better care of their babies them MIL does of mine. My MIL got upset about this and began screaming at me saying I'm a bad parent and horrible person.\n\nMy FIL has also chimed in calling me a shitty person and lambasting me for not giving them a second chance. My husband and mom agree with me. My SIL agrees with me but thinks I went about it rudely and should apologize and give them a chance my FIL also thinks I should apologize. My MIL's feelings are really hurt my SIL told me she hasn't gotten out of bed since I said that.\n\nI feel horrible but justified I can't tell if I'm being an asshole though.
