(I'm using fake names for the kids) My oldest Bri(7f), Ellie (3f), and our 3-month-old twins. My husband grew up in a very wealthy family they had one nanny for daytime and one nanny for nighttime. My SIL and husband have told me it was pretty rare they spent time with their parents, and even when they did there was always a nanny with them.\n\nCurrently, my mom lives with my husband and I. My dad passed away unexpectedly last year and since then my mother has moved in to help with the kids. A couple of days ago my mom slipped on the stairs and ended up needing surgery. My mom being on bedrest combined with having brand new twins a toddler and a big kid, my husband and I are stretched pretty thin.\n\nBri has a very important soccer game coming up and she wants both me and her dad to come. My husband and I have been looking for a sitter who will be able to watch our youngest 3 while we go. My husband ended up telling my MIL about us looking for a sitter and she and my FIL offered to watch the kids while we went.\n\nI told my husband I was hesitant about her watching the kids after what happened when she was watching the older two for the first/only time. My MIL was babysitting Ellie and Bri once when Ellie was 1 year old and Bri was 5. Despite leaving instructions MIL and FIL didn\u2019t change Ellie, feed her (The housekeeper did), Feed Bri, left Ellie unattended on the kitchen counters and left Bri unattended outside by their uncovered pool.\n\nThey have since both apologized for this. Claiming they were too stressed out and needed extra support. My husband has in the past made excuses for this by saying they aren't really experienced with kids and didn't know. But has since stopped.\n\nYesterday I decided I wasn't at all comfortable with them watching the kids. And politely thanked my MIL for the offer and told her we already have a sitter lined up (We do). My MIL pressed me about it and kept asking why I would want to pay someone when she can do it for free and asking if I was lying to her.\n\nAfter many texts and calls, I got fed up and told her truthfully I don't trust her around my kids at all and that she's irresponsible, that I don't feel safe leaving my kids in her care, and that sea otters take better care of their babies them MIL does of mine. My MIL got upset about this and began screaming at me saying I'm a bad parent and horrible person.\n\nMy FIL has also chimed in calling me a shitty person and lambasting me for not giving them a second chance. My husband and mom agree with me. My SIL agrees with me but thinks I went about it rudely and should apologize and give them a chance my FIL also thinks I should apologize. My MIL's feelings are really hurt my SIL told me she hasn't gotten out of bed since I said that.\n\nI feel horrible but justified I can't tell if I'm being an asshole though.

Well, years later, we have our youngest and my husband wants the kids to spend more time with her. She freaking loses her in the store the first time she's ever taken them out alone since the Japan thing, and someone brought her back over to my MIL after a few minutes of my three year old daughter walking around the aisles.

To this day, my daughter (8) still remembers the distress she felt trying to find her grandma in the store. \n\nThe next time I went out shopping with MIL I wanted to see what she normally does and kind of pretended to be looking around at other parts of the store while she had the kids.
