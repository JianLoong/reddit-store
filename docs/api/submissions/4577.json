{"id": 4577, "submission_id": "zkd656", "title": "AITA for refusing to forgive my drug addict BIL", "selftext": "My BIL, Steven, is a drug addict.  To feed his addiction he has lied, manipulated and stolen from just about everyone \u2013 including me and my wife. He has also spent time in both rehab and jail. From me personally he stole money, a TV and a computer. More importantly about 2 years ago he stole the watch I inherited from my Dad who passed away when I was 10. Steven knew when he stole it what the watch meant to me \u2013 it was pretty much the only thing I had left of my dad. After that I told my wife and my in-laws that I was done with him. He was not welcome in my home. I would not go anywhere he was at \u2013 including their home. At the time my wife, Sara, supported me in this. \n\nSteven got done with another stint in rehab about three months ago. According to Sara he is clean now and is even working a part-time job. She told me that she wanted to invite Steven to Thanksgiving Dinner. I said no. I didn\u2019t care if he was on drugs right at that moment, I don\u2019t want him in my house. She kept talking to me about this for about a week and I refused to agree. Thanksgiving gets here and when I go to open the door my mother-in-law and Steven is standing there. I said that he was not coming in my house. My MIL says that she wants to have Thanksgiving dinner with both her children. I said she\u2019s not doing it here.  \n\nAt this point Steven says he wants to apologize to me. I told him that I would forgive him when he gave me back my father\u2019s watch \u2013 and until he does he can stick his apology. This upsets my MIL \u2013 who starts crying. Steven is going on about how he is different now. I told him that I didn\u2019t care and I don\u2019t believe him anyway.  At this point my wife says that I should let the past go. I told her there was no way in hell I was letting it go and that if she wants to eat dinner with her brother the thief she can do it somewhere else, but it wasn\u2019t happening here. Sara tells me it is her home too \u2013 which it is. I tell her this is my home and I come before her brother in this house. I would never ask her to let someone she didn\u2019t want into our home and I deserve the same respect. \n\nSara asked me what was more important \u2013 her brother or a \u201cstupid watch\u201d. I told her my watch was all I had of my father and I value it a hell of lot more than a drug addict thief. All of this is happening in the doorway as I refuse to move to let him in. At this point Steven says that he\u2019ll go and turns to walk away. My MIL goes with him. My wife is furious and we have dinner alone \u2013 in total silence. \n\nThe next day MIL calls my wife. Steven had gone out the prior night and when he got home he was obviously high. MIL and Sara are saying this is my fault as I upset him. Steven has now disappeared and no one knows where he is. MIL is frantic (as she is every time he pulls this shit) and Sara is telling me that I goaded Steven into doing drugs again \u2013 which sounds like complete bullshit to me. \n\nSo am AITA for refusing to tell my idiotic BIL stealing my Dad\u2019s watch is fine?", "created_utc": 1670882818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkd656/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_drug_addict_bil/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Part of the rehab process is warning them that not everyone will forgive them and that is your right. At least how I understand it. You have no obligation to forgive him and your wife should know that as well and not try to force you to. He hurt you as much as anyone and you have a right to your feelings.", "People in recovery know that no one they've harmed through their addiction is required to forgive them in their sobriety. Your wife forced your hand, and you stood your ground. Is it possible the argument contributed to the BIL using later that night? Maybe, but that isn't on you--that's on self-loathing. NTA.", "NTA. An addict is responsible for his own choices. He\u2019s actions are not caused by anyone.", "NTA. And 100% not to blame for him going off and using again. After my cousin emptied our grandmothers life savings to pay for her drugs and abandoned their child, I cut them out of my life. \n\nI believe in 2nd, and even 3rd chances. But it takes a lot more than just a \u201csorry, I\u2019m fine now\u201d. It takes YEARS to rebuild that kind of trust.", "NTA, and you did not cause BIL to get high. Addicts always blame others.  Is there a group like Al Anon (maybe Narc Anon for relatives) to help her understand this", "No one is to blame when an addict chooses to relapse. It\u2019s not your fault for turning him away, and your wife is invalidating your feelings and blaming the wrong person.\n\nSince she thinks your watch is \u201cstupid\u201d when it has sentimental value to you, perhaps now it\u2019s time to think long and hard about how this marriage is truly making you feel. It is understandable that Sara loves her brother, but her brother has stolen numerous things from you and will never give them back. The watch was clearly the last straw. It\u2019s irreplaceable and meant so much to you. The watch may not be replaceable, but if your wife fails to see *your* value, she can easily be replaced.\n\nMost extreme addicts don\u2019t change unless they make the effort and want to. Steven relapsing was his fault and his fault alone. There is always a risk that you take when you let an addict into your home. My ex-husband kept luring me in when we were separated, and he stole from me over and over again until I caught onto it and banned him from my house.\n\nYou have a human right to your feelings, and you also have good reason for your demands. If your wife does not cut ties with her brother, you can cut ties with her to create a better life for yourself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If your refusal to forgive him for stealing the last reminder you had of your dad \"drove BIL to do drugs again\" he is not different.  Anyone who apologizes,  however sincerely, should know that it may not be accepted and deal with it. BIL sold MIL and your wife a bill of goods. They all need a reality check.", "NTA. If MIL wants to have Thanksgiving with both her children she can do that at her house so he can steal her stuff instead of yours.", "First of all Steven is responsible for his own actions, and your MIL and wife need to stop enabling him. Sorry about your watch, I can't image how devastated you felt after finding out what happened to it. Does your wife understand how important it was to you? \n\nNTA\n\nHopefully your BIL found his way back into rehab.", "NTA you are not responsible for an addict's actions. Sara can see her brother outside the home. It's not that difficult.", "NTA\n\nRecovering alcoholic here. The point of making amends is for the addict/alcoholic to make the *other* person feel the situation has been remedied, it is not for the addict to be \"forgiven\". Yes, often forgiveness is something that happens in these situations, but that's not the point. When I make amends to someone my goal should be to try and make *them* feel better, not myself. If the other person tells me to go to hell or tells me they will never forgive me **that is 100% their right to do so**, and in **no way is the other person responsible for my sobriety.**", "NTA. I have my grandma's wedding ring. I'd be devastated if this happened to it. He may change at some point (obviously not now, since he went right back to it at the first conflict) - I do believe people can change, but he has to show that he has and earn his way back into your life, one step at a time. Not just show up at your door expecting it to be ok. \n\nAnd no, you didn't send him back to that life. That was his choice to make.", "NTA. When an addict makes amends, they are told by their sponsor that they can only ask for forgiveness. It's up to the person they hurt to accept the apology. \n\nHe may have said he wanted to apologize to just get in the door. Either way, in the 12 step programs, they tell you that you are not the reason someone relapses. It's always the addicts choice. \n\nPerhaps your wife and her family need ala-non.", "NTA\nAs a daughter of an addict, I would never pressure anyone to forgive my mom for any wrongs she did that they were not ready to forgive. I would also never blame anyone for her relapses. \n\nYour wife and MIL created that whole scene like it was a feel good movie plot and downplayed your loss like the watch came out of a cereal box just before it was stolen. Just because they are accustomed to rolling with the thievery and lies doesn't mean you have to. \n\nI agree with other comments, they need counseling to stop the enabling.", "This is a really sad situation. I understand why your wife's family feel upset. They are trying to be supportive. \n\nBut I can't say anything but NTA here. You have a right to be hurt. You have a right to cut yourself off from him. \n\nAnd your BIL has to, at some point, realize that most people who successfully get out of addiction do so in part by making amends. It's step 8 and 9 in the AA 12 steps. It doesn't sound like he's really covered that ground. \"I'm different now\" isn't an apology. And showing up unannounced to a holiday dinner is not making amends. \n\nI'm sorry you lost your watch, and that you've not seen a meaningful apology for what he did. I'm also sorry that he chose to use again after this incident. I hope he changes his behaviour, and that some day if he can find a way to meaningfully recognize the harm he did to you, you may be able to reconcile at some level.", "NTA the asshole at all. As a person in long-term recovery, part of my recovery was learning that people had the right to not forgive me for my past misdeeds, and how to stay sober despite this, and respect their decisions. Sounds like this guy has not learned that yet.", "NTA. Your wife crossed your boundary by inviting him over behind your back. You stuck to your boundary, and that\u2019s that. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your watch\u2026for drugs. Not everyone understands that items can hold great sentimental value. Its like holding onto a piece of them\u2026", "NTA\nSo the golden child didn't get what he wanted once and that was all it took to go out and geft drugged again? That's some personal change...\nYou dodged a bullet there, and the fact that everybody else is already making excuses and blaming you for his behavior shows that they're still co dependent. Do look that concept up, it's really useful to understand the behaviour of those close to addicts.", "NTA and if anyone is responsible for his relapse it\u2019s the family members who brought him somewhere they knew he wasn\u2019t welcome and forced you to have that interaction. I believe very strongly in giving people second chances but no one is entitled to forgiveness and you have every right to not forgive him for what he did.", "NTA\nThey're enabling him. He disrespected you, broke your trust and these are his consequences.\nThey both suck because they're acting like you got the drugs and stuck him with the needle!!\nHe's pulliing this stunt to make them fawn over him. If he really had changed his was and was sorry, he'd be doing everything he could to earn  your trust back, make amends and actuly respect your boundaries.", "NTA.  \n\nYou wife and MIL obviously plan this surprise on you.  You wife, MIL and steven don't seem to understand that their actions have consequences.   Selling a family heirloom to sell for drugs is despicable.", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for the relapse of an addict. \n\nIf anyone is responsible for the scene it is your wife and MIL for ambushing you, against your wishes, in your own home. But they aren\u2019t responsible for his relapse either just for a completely avoidable big fat drama.", "NTA. You put up with enough of his BS. You made your stance perfectly clear. No one has a right to tell you when to let something go and the lack of respect from your wife and MIL is disgusting. As for placing his relapse at your feet, they put him in that position. They knew how you felt and still thought it was a good idea to knock on your door, that is solely on THEM.", "NTA. If having dinner with both of her children was so important,  your MIL could have cooked and had dinner at her home. The fact that your wife, MIL and BIL decided to \"surprise \" you when they all knew your boundaries is terrible.\n\nYou did not your BIL relapse. His addiction did. That's what addiction does. And BIL needs to understand that there are some actions that cannot be forgiven. That is supposed to be part of his recovery process. \n\nI am sorry about the loss of your dad and his watch.", "NTA You were clear you didn't want BIL there yet they brought him anyway. Any subsequent fall out results from setting up that avoidable situation. BIL falling off the wagon is totally on him, despite his chorus of enablers. He stole your father's watch. I'd be furious that your wife minimized how much that hurt you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t cause the golden brother to get high. The golden brother caused himself to get high.", "NTA this made me so angry - how dare everyone just be fine with trampling your (very clearly vocalized and defined) boundaries like this? OP's feelings are valid and don't take a back seat to another round of sober hope. Shame on your wife, shame on your MIL, and don't let the door hit Steven's ass on the way out. \n\nIf you want to do Thanksgiving all together, it has to be somewhere else. And OP would be in the right to skip it anyway - his choice.", "NTA, it's not your fault.  Forgiving an addict is hard, especially when you can't be sure if they are finally clean.  He clearly was not and chances are hasn't been.", "NTA- they are deluded. He was never more than one bad day away from being right back at it. He still was not accepting responsibility for his actions. Simply saying \"sorry\" and claiming to be different is what literally every addict does before they clean you out. \n\nthis is not your fault. Amends have not been made and your wife and MIL are clueless about recovery.", "NTA. Addicts relapse. It's what they do. And at three months he is still in recovery. And odds are he has already been getting high this entire time. If he got high last night then literally anything was going to give him that excuse. He would have gotten because it was Thanksgiving. \n\nIf your wife doesn't respect your feelings about that watch then she doesn't respect you. If she doesn't respect you then this relationship cannot work. That she had no problem dropping him on you like that is a huge red flag in your relationship. One where you need to have a very long, very serious discussion where divorce is one potential outcome. \n\nJust because someone apologizes doesn't mean you have to forgive them. And some things are unforgivable.\n\nYou made your line in the sand they chose to cross it. At the very least THEY are the cause of a relapse because they enable his behavior. They'll always bail him out. They will always blame others for his actions. \n\nThis alone would made me reconsider my marriage.", "NTA.\n\nSteven even did you thr favor of proving you right when you pointed out his apology was a sack of bullcrap. \n\nYour wife needs counseling and a support group.", "NTA People like Steven are hard to rehab.  He looked for any reason to return to using, thus proving you right that he had not changed.  You have no part in this.  Your wife seems to want to jump on the forgiveness train and demeaned the only thing you had of your father's. Frankly, why have you not already started divorce proceedings?", "This is so tough. Addiction is terrible but it really does not excuse bad behavior. \n\nNTA - you alone can choose when to forgive and when not to. It was HIS choice to get high after seeing you, you did not make him get high. \n\nI wish your brother the best of luck in his recovery, and you the best of luck in repairing relationships.", "Nta Steven proved he can\u2019t be trusted", "NTA, isn\u2019t part of the rehab program is apologizing to someone but knowing that they won\u2019t forgive you for what you did. You don\u2019t have to apologize for what you said, and to be honest you are probably right about him being full of crap. Stand strong OP.", "Former substance abuse counselor here. Absolutely one hundred percent NTA.  \n\nThere were a thousand ways they could have gone about this. They could have invited you to a restaurant or sent you a letter. Anything other than ambushing you, making you feel unsafe in your own home, and then blaming you for an addict's choices. \n\nStand your ground and good luck. I'm sorry about your watch and even sorrier because I'm pretty sure we've just seen a preview of your Christmas.", "I have to say NTA but the situation hurts to read. Too many of my family have been lost to drugs in one form or another. It sucks. I hope your BIL can get through Recovery.", "NTA. No one is due forgiveness (guarantees from their religion may square them with their God, but you don't fit that category). For your wife's sake,  you should given him a chance to make amends as part of his recovery program, but again,  his redemption does not require your forgiveness. You've even told him how he can redeem himself by tracking down that watch.\n\nAs for thanksgiving: your home, your rules. It's also your wife's home and her rules too. If you can't work out agreed rules, you might find your wife moves someplace where her opinions matter, too. That's for you two to work out. Regardless, in this situation, your BIL's actions pretty much prove your point that he was not a changed as he professed to be.", "100% not your fault and I don\u2019t blame you at all for how you felt and if a minor altercation made him fall off the wagon it was going to happen anyway\u2026", "NTA \n\nHe stole something of yours that was your deceased father that you will never get back. The whole I\u2019ve changed bit doesn\u2019t work as good as apology. Which you are still owed. If you don\u2019t want him in your house you don\u2019t have to have him in your home. His relapse is on him. If you not letting him into your house set him off that means a someone turning him down for a date or him losing his job would\u2019ve had the same effect on him.", "NTA. You do have a wife problem, though. You two should seek counseling to work through this because it is going to keep coming up. Your wife\u2019s family has some unhealthy coping mechanisms that have the potential to ruin your marriage.", "NTA. Frankly, if my partner put me in the position your wife did, she wouldn't be in the same house as me until she admitted what she did was wrong and we went to couples counseling. She stomped all over a very hard boundry and put both you and her brother in a terrible position. No one is to blame for your BIL's relapse, but if your wife and MIL want to point fingers   - they should be pointing them in the mirror.\n\nAddicts have an incredibly high rate of relapse and 3 months is not a long time. There is absolutely no reason to \"forgive & forget\" someone who hurt you that deeply and certainly not after 3 months clean. \n\nYour wife and MIL put a lot of pressure on someone who couldn't handle it by pulling this stunt. Their blind hope and belief that everything is OK now is not only naive, it is dangerous for everyone, but especially her brother.", "I can see why Steven is the way he is. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You shouldn't have to put up with any of this. He can do whatever he wants because they will always make excuses for him. Having him turn up at your house like that was disgraceful.", "NTA. As the relative of someone who went through through recovery, one of the steps is to make amends, so long as it doesn't harm the aggrieved person. You and you alone decide whether you are ready to have that conversation and it's really crappy that your MIL and wife tried to force that upon you on Thanksgiving. Sure they want to play happy family, but all they're doing is enabling BIL to continue his terrible lifestyle. \n\nI wish you the best of luck, OP. This isn't an easy situation.", "NTA you\u2019re not responsible for his sobriety, he choose to get high. He needs to take accountability and your wife needs to stop enabling him. You have a serious spouse problem, talk to her about couples counseling.", "They forced your hand. Your wife knew man. NTA", "NTA but recommend getting cameras on your property just in case as if your wife decides she wants him over while your not home at least you can have video evidence if he takes things again", "NTA. You had a very understandable red line and a condition for rekindling a relationship with him. Sounds like you have a wife problem, not a BIL problem.", "Nahhhh NTA as an addict myself I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong. Good for you for staying strong. He was just looking for any excuse to get high again.", "NTA \n\nHe stole it knowing it was the only thing you have from your Dad!\n\nReturn it and I will consider listening to your apology is entirely reasonable! \n\nPlus he is in YOUR house!\n\nThat\u2019s not cool!", "Nta, stick to your guns, id have done way more than just not let him in, so mad proud of you for staying civil", "NTA believe it or not your response may actually aid his recovery long term.", "NTA\n\n\nThere is no time limit on grudges. Especially with \u2018family\u2019 lol! \n\nKeep yourself and your loved ones far away from the addict.", "NTA\n\nYou were ambushed by someone who hurt you in an attempt to force you to forgive them, that's AH behaviour from everyone involved. You are under no obligation to forgive your BIL...ever. \n\nAddiction is a hellish disease, for the addict and for everyone around them, and it's very difficult to recover from. Relapses happen and they're nobody's fault. Was the argument the catalyst for this relapse? Probably, but you didn't cause the argument, and even if you had it still wouldn't be your fault. You've done nothing wrong in this situation.", "Wife is the AH for asking you and then not respecting your answer. Not making you a priority. Not being up front with you. Being passive-aggressive about it. Surprising you that way with someone who hurt you so badly. She set everyone up for that nasty scene.\n\nIf she wants to be part of a healthy marriage, she\u2019s going to need some support herself to learn how to manage situations like this. Maybe that\u2019s therapy for her, or Al-Anon, or ???

He needs to show progress before he\u2019s allowed around kids. Even if he\u2019s clean, if he relapses, this in and out has the potential to be damaging to young children. \n\nAll of your family could use therapy, whether that is family, couple, individual therapy or a combination (I\u2019d advice individual therapy at least) Cus addiction is a source of trauma for loved ones too, you see someone you love destroy themselves, suffer and in the process hurt others around them. That\u2019s all extremely difficult.

You're not obligated to accept even a single apology that comes your way. Further, only he is responsible for his relapse. Part of the process of overcoming addiction is managing the emotions that lead to relapse and avoiding situations where relapse is likely - like your BIL refusing to accept your apology and it ruining a family holiday. Thanksgiving was not the time to issue an apology specifically because it might not go well, especially after you already said no. If you're to blame for his relapse, so are his mother and sister for putting him in that situation when they already knew how you felt about it.", "NTA His recovery is his responsibility and nobody else\u2019s. It can be hard for families dealing with codependency and guilt when a family member has addiction issues. There are support groups out there such as AlAnon for the loved ones to more clearly understand what their role can look like in someone\u2019s recovery and how not to enable that person.", "NTA, but honestly, unless you\u2019re willing to deal with this for the rest of your life, you might want to seriously consider separation. \n\nMy uncle has been an addict most of my life, and he always relapses (the longest he went without at one point was a little over a year, I think, or maybe almost a year). He\u2019s also great at manipulating everyone around him, especially playing my grandparents against each other, so they\u2019re never on the same page regarding what to do with him. The local law enforcement (my family lives in Vancouver) does nothing, even when there\u2019s proof of him threatening non-family (he's also gotten physical with my grandparents, leading to my grandmother needing stitches for a head wound, but they didn't report him). My grandparents even paid out of pocket at one point as well for a rehab facility which also didn\u2019t work. Apparently, there\u2019s a team helping him now, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because I finally put up a boundary with my grandparents and mother that I don\u2019t want to hear anymore. It works well enough since I don\u2019t live in the same province or talk to/engage him anymore (although when I visited over the summer, it got kind of difficult since he just pushes and pushes since everyone else gives in if he pushes enough). \n\nHowever, if you live nearby (anywhere that\u2019s bus-able), you\u2019re going to have to deal with whatever bs he brings with him, and as seen in the post, he will relapse multiple times. I know many people talk about addiction as a mental health issue, and I\u2019m not going to get into that or dispute it because the point is that it doesn\u2019t erase the negative impact someone\u2019s addiction has on their family, even if it is a mental health issue. It\u2019s really painful and hard to go through, especially since the people they\u2019re manipulating most will typically put them above you and force you to cater to their needs and wants over your needs and boundaries. \n\nEx. My paternal grandpa died, and when my grandparents visited with my uncle, my mother expected me to monitor him essentially - all the adults in my life handled that entire loss so poorly, but that\u2019s one particular incident that I\u2019ll never forget because a 12-year-old should not have to put aside their own grief because an adult can\u2019t get it together and sit quietly in front of others. \n\nIf you take nothing else from my comment, just don\u2019t have any kids with your wife. She\u2019ll likely do something similar to my mother because \u201che\u2019s my brother, and we grew up together.\u201d I actually lived with my grandparents/uncle, especially when this first started.

I\u2019ve found that words are really cheap in this situation. Your wife may promise to change/respect you and your boundaries, but, as evident above, it\u2019s very unlikely she\u2019ll follow through (my mom still drives around looking for my uncle when he decides to go missing for days on end and so do my grandparents even if they promise themselves and us that they\u2019re done - they somewhat respect my boundaries because I don\u2019t live there anymore, but toward the end of summer there was definitely the beginnings of some pushing). \n\nReally just take some time to think and reflect on what you do and do not want the rest of your life to look like.", "NTA\n\nAnd him getting high was his own damn decision.

Coercion isn't pretty.  The confrontation is on them, not you.  Btw, in my professional life I saw many addicted people.  Only a very few get free.  I applaud everyone who does get free but showing that you are free takes years, not a few days or a few weeks.  Stick to you guns.", "NTA. This is not your fault, OP.

Addicts will stop at nothing to get their fix.", "NTA and your family needs to understand that they forced this confrontation and Steve used it as an excuse to get high again. They gave him an excuse", "Nta", "NTA and definitely not to blame.  There are consequences for our actions and sometimes they are permanent.  He should have never showed up and blaming you for his continued drug use is disgusting.  He doesn\u2019t care about anything but his addiction.  Some drug users cannot stay clean no matter how much support they get.", "NTA. One tough patch and right back. If he was really trying he\u2019d have reached out to his sponsor or other supporters. Instead he went right to the dealer.", "NTA. I feel for Steven, really I do, this is an impossible situation with no winning. However, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s your home too.

And that\u2019s not even addressing the fact that your wife LIED to you, because yes a lie by omission is still lying, and trapped you into a confrontation with Steven by just,,, inviting him anyways without telling you. Fantastic. Yeah sure you coulda been nicer, but at the end of the day, you were warranted in your reaction. He made his choices, so did your wife. You get to make yours.", "NTA. You are not responsible for your BIL\u2019s addiction or relapse.\n\nI would forgive but I also understand that you can\u2019t. People are different and that\u2019s fine. \n\nYour wife is also not an AH. She\u2019s trying to find a way to get back to her brother. So cut her some slack. But unless you forced drugs down the throat of you BIL, you need to make your wife understand that this behaviour is not special. A man staying clean for 3 months is what most people do.

To feed his addiction he has lied, manipulated and stolen from just about everyone \u2013 including me and my wife. He has also spent time in both rehab and jail. From me personally he stole money, a TV and a computer. More importantly about 2 years ago he stole the watch I inherited from my Dad who passed away when I was 10. Steven knew when he stole it what the watch meant to me \u2013 it was pretty much the only thing I had left of my dad. After that I told my wife and my in-laws that I was done with him. He was not welcome in my home. I would not go anywhere he was at \u2013 including their home. At the time my wife, Sara, supported me in this. \n\nSteven got done with another stint in rehab about three months ago. According to Sara he is clean now and is even working a part-time job. She told me that she wanted to invite Steven to Thanksgiving Dinner. I said no. I didn\u2019t care if he was on drugs right at that moment, I don\u2019t want him in my house. She kept talking to me about this for about a week and I refused to agree. Thanksgiving gets here and when I go to open the door my mother-in-law and Steven is standing there. I said that he was not coming in my house. My MIL says that she wants to have Thanksgiving dinner with both her children. I said she\u2019s not doing it here.  \n\nAt this point Steven says he wants to apologize to me. I told him that I would forgive him when he gave me back my father\u2019s watch \u2013 and until he does he can stick his apology. This upsets my MIL \u2013 who starts crying. Steven is going on about how he is different now. I told him that I didn\u2019t care and I don\u2019t believe him anyway.  At this point my wife says that I should let the past go. I told her there was no way in hell I was letting it go and that if she wants to eat dinner with her brother the thief she can do it somewhere else, but it wasn\u2019t happening here. Sara tells me it is her home too \u2013 which it is. I tell her this is my home and I come before her brother in this house. I would never ask her to let someone she didn\u2019t want into our home and I deserve the same respect. \n\nSara asked me what was more important \u2013 her brother or a \u201cstupid watch\u201d. I told her my watch was all I had of my father and I value it a hell of lot more than a drug addict thief. All of this is happening in the doorway as I refuse to move to let him in. At this point Steven says that he\u2019ll go and turns to walk away. My MIL goes with him. My wife is furious and we have dinner alone \u2013 in total silence. \n\nThe next day MIL calls my wife. Steven had gone out the prior night and when he got home he was obviously high. MIL and Sara are saying this is my fault as I upset him. Steven has now disappeared and no one knows where he is. MIL is frantic (as she is every time he pulls this shit) and Sara is telling me that I goaded Steven into doing drugs again \u2013 which sounds like complete bullshit to me. \n\nSo am AITA for refusing to tell my idiotic BIL stealing my Dad\u2019s watch is fine?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just because a person is sorry doesn't change anything. Just because a person is an addict doesn't excuse their behaviour and it would take more like 3 years of cleaning living instead of 3 months to be taken seriously.", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was 13/14 my dad who resided in the UK, purchased me a brand new digital camera. I was so excited and when I got back home (Thailand) I took pictures of EVERYTHING. I had it plugged into the family computer downstairs and was downloading the images. \n\nMy cousin who was a grown ass woman, came to the house to ask my mom for money. When I wasn\u2019t looking she took my brand new camera and left. She sold it for drugs. It wasn\u2019t even a week old. I cried like a baby and begged my mom to do something. All my mom would say is \u201cwell what do you want me to do?\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything.\u201d \u201cGrow up and go and ask your dad for a new one.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s poor and doesn\u2019t have any money she needs it more than you.\u201d \n\n\nIt\u2019s been 14 years and I still haven\u2019t forgiven her nor will I ever.

He went and got high because he is an addict and that is what addicts do. Period. After my lifetime of experience with addicts, I don't care how much someone says they are recovered, I still watch them like a hawk and hope for the best but expect the worst.

Junkies never learn.", "NTA when you said he left, I was hoping to read he was going to come back with a similar watch. Sorry man", "NTA.", "NTA they did something incredibly stupid. They knew you were still angry and didn't want him there. They put HIM in a horrible position where they knew he was going to be confronted by a hurt person who didn't want him there. They caused this and forced you and him into a situation where you both ended up very hurt and taken advantage of.\n\nWhat your MIL and wife did was very manipulative and they have caused a lot of damage to him, you, and all your relationships.", "NTA. Steven chose the drugs. Steven made that choice. Steven is used to everyone everyone bailing him out. You didn\u2019t cause that.", "NTA, You have a right to say you do not trust someone in your house, you made it clear well beforehand that he is not welcome. they tried to push it on you both clearly having planned out this interaction. i understand them being upset, but clearly if that's all it took to get Steven back off the band wagon, he was not there securely. you decide when you forgive someone.", "NTA he could have went and got the watch back instead of getting high again. fuck him.", "NAH. You didn't put drugs in him, the only person responsible for a relapse is him. But family is complicated and noone came into this with bad intentions. Some things aren't possible to get over and that's what happens.", "NTA. But you'd better pray he shows up alive or your marriage is over.", "Esh,\nIt sucks as a parent I would want to believe my child could get better and was better.  Where your MIL and wife are AH is they sprung this on you in your home knowing how you felt.  Who knows if it pushed him over, but they need to own that they forced this confrontation.", "I gotta go with NAH on this one. \n\nI completely understand your stance, and I admire that you\u2019re willing to take a stand when you feel it is necessary. I don\u2019t fault you there. \n\nWith that said, addiction is a disease with all kinds of horrible effects. Would you feel the same way if he stole from you to pay for cancer treatment?  He\u2019s sick, not malicious. Personally, I try not to punish people because of their illness. \n\nYou can forgive without forgetting. You can\u2019t change the past, but you *can* move to a better future. There\u2019s middle ground to be found here. Maybe he can visit, but isn\u2019t left alone and all medications out of the bathroom for the visit?\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, it sounds like not forgiving him is only harming you. You\u2019re still very hurt by this, and it takes a toll. That\u2019s a ton of emotional weight to carry around.  Oftentimes forgiveness helps the forgiver more than the person being forgiven.\n\nBut do NOT, for one second, blame yourself for him falling off the wagon. Getting well is tough, and relapses do happen, but it is ALWAYS the addict\u2019s fault when they do. You didn\u2019t provide the substance, didn\u2019t enable or encourage.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear of your situation, and I hope can all come to some peace.", "The government is the AH here. Imagine if instead of jail, he got a safe supply? Imagine if he didn't have to steal but just got what he needed from a pharmacist? \n\nYou're allowed to cut him off and never speak to him again, but consider fighting for decriminalization in memory of the relationship you could have had instead of this.", "I understand what the watch meant and understand you don't understand addiction. Odds are pretty great you did cause his relapse and that sucks. Treating someone trying to get right like this is disgusting behavior. He understands he did wrong and was obviously trying to make amends but you were completely unnecessary and please know you aren't perfect either. Hopefully nobody treats you this shitty over your past mistakes.", "YUP. This right here. Steven's recovery process involved apologizing to OP, but there's no requirement that OP accept the apology. Besides the fact that this one incident caused enough \"stress\" to send Steven spiraling back into drugs means that he absolutely hasn't healed. NTA", "Exactly! When you\u2019re in recovery, part of it is taking accountability for what you did when you were using. That means understanding that you choose to use or not when you\u2019re in a difficult situation. It also means recognising the hurt you caused others, and reaching out to make amends. What it doesn\u2019t mean is making it obligatory for your loved ones to forgive you immediately. \n\nNot to mention that if your wife and ILs really wanted to help BIL, as opposed to playing pretend happy family, they would have first discussed it with you, listened to your boundary and then talked to BIL calmly about it. Not spring this up on you, create a situation that stirrs up a lot of sensitive emotions and basically make the environment unstable.", "YUP. And the fact that BIL slipped up like hours after he said he's changed and recovered suggests that he hadn't done any of those things.", "I'm curious if it was court ordered rehab. I have never seen court ordered rehab  work in the long term.", "With enablers like his mother he will never get clean, and he was always planning on getting high that. \n\nI've dealt with enough addicts to see the pattern and the rationale.", "Besides the \"making amends\" of step nine involves a lot more than just saying you're sorry.  You should be made whole for anything he stole from you and I don't see that he has done that.  Your damn relatives need to understand that some things are just unforgiveable.", "I disagree, the wife is absolutely an AH.  If I were OP I would be 1000x more upset by her behavior than the brother.  OP is not married to the brother or MIL, betrayal from them is nowhere near as hurtful. But you expect your wife to have your back and respect very reasonable boundaries instead of insulting your connection to a cherished family heirloom. I get it, the wife\u2019s desire to help her brother is understandable, but her behavior is completely unacceptable.", "How on earth aren\u2019t the wife and mil who blatantly ignored his wishes and ambushed him on tg not ah\u2019s? Terrible take.", "if that pushed him over then he was never more than a bad day away from relapse. He was not accepting responsibility for his actions. Apology and claiming to be different do not amends make. The proof is in the pudding, he went right back at it. He was no where near recovered and his MIL did him a massive disservice by failing to understand the recovery process.", "Wait - why is OP an A H? He didn't say one way or the other whether he believed the brother was clean or not, just that he wasn't welcome - a clear and simple boundary that he has expressed multiple times. I don't think the enforcement warrants an A H.", "Did you really just compare addiction to cancer?\n\nStealing to get a fix is not the same as stealing for chemo. Not even in the same universe. \n\nHe didn't even steal to get rehab. He stole to get more drugs, your analogy only makes sense if someone steals to get more cancer. \n\nAnd then they brought Steven over and forced a confrontation. \n\nYou judgement makes zero sense.", "The dude stole from OP - is he expected to lock everything of value up offsite whenever the BIL might happen to show up just so he doesn\u2019t have ti worry about it going missing? That\u2019s no way to live. \n\nAnd if the BIL wants to be in OP\u2019s life, maybe he should actually stay clean long enough to be believed when he says \u201cI\u2019ve changed\u201d. Being an addict doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no repercussions for your actions, one of which is lack of trust (and rightfully so).", "> Imagine if he didn't have to steal but just got what he needed from a pharmacist?\n\nYou still have to pay for prescriptions, so the stealing is still in play. And decriminalization is a non-issue with this situation.", "It is disgusting to not want to be ambushed on Thanksgiving by a thief? Alright then...", "OP understand addiction a hell of a lot better than you do.", "> was obviously trying to make amends\n\nIf he wanted to make amends, he would have respected OP and maybe apologized when he wasn\u2019t trying to get his way. \n\nOP is allowed to have boundaries for his life, especially around someone who stole from him in the past, and enforcing those boundaries did not cause the BIL\u2019s relapse.", "Also, if you want to apologize to someone you don't just go to their house unannounced for thanksgiving. That is not how these things work. \n\nIt takes time and good actions to gain trust again. You put in the work. \n\nBIL has shown over and over again he can't be trusted. Addiction is a disease, but you have to battle it to try to overcome it.", "Plus MIL and Sister \u201cIt\u2019s not Stephen\u2019s fault he got high!

Forgiveness is something that I believe is best considered between the forgiver and the person who transgressed, but I'm with ya.", "Lots of people in recovery are a bad day or a day where they are forced to deal with the consequences of their actions away from relapse.  We have a friend who always relapses when she sees that just saying she is better and been through rehab doesn't  make it all go away.  \n\nI'm sure MIL and wife thought this great moment would be a huge boost for him  but they didn't war game it out and anticipate the worst outcome.", "Meant to say wife and MIL were AH.", "I am simply pointing out that Steven is *sick* , not malicious. I think that\u2019s important to take into account.\n\nYour other point is valid, though, but I think the AH is the MIL for bringing Steven over in the first place.", "How is it a non-issue when the entire problem is that the dude was forced to lie and steal and go to jail and rehab because of the war on drugs? \nWithout criminalization, he would have gotten a prescription, would have been able to maintain a job instead of making looking for drugs his full time job, he could have maintained decent relationships with family if they weren't assholes about his drug use. \nPrescriptions are very cheap and should be free, as they are in lots of places or covered by insurance for places without universal coverage. \n\nIf we support people instead of punishing them, drug addiction looks completely different.", "My guess is OP's wife's family had a long tradition of just getting over things/sweeping things under the rug, so the concept of doing the work is really foreign", "Man, if Stephen's sobriety hinges solely and completely upon OP forgiving and forgetting the shit he's pulled, I don't think he's ready to *be* sober.\n\nMIL and Sara are doing this man no favors, and boy if Stephen completely spirals, maybe even ODs, they will blame OP for-ever. Which will remain ridiculous. \"Goaded\" him into doing drugs again? Jesus, the power OP holds of *making* someone do drugs by withholding forgiveness for, let me check... Getting a highly sentimental item stolen from him.\n\nI'm surprised OP wasn't also blamed for getting robbed at the time, seems like the kind of thing this family would accuse him of.", "Exactly! OP did supply him the drug, didn\u2019t make him take it.

But when you\u2019re in that state, you\u2019ve got to learn your triggers and go slowly with facing them, not just jump in the deep end. You\u2019re so on the nose that the family is enabling atm", "yeah- but this is a standard thing which is taught in recovery- others are not required to forgive your actions committed as an addict just because you happen to be sober at the moment.", "Addicts steal from family members because of easy access and few if any repercussions.\n\nThe addict thought this through. Knew the watch was in the house. Knew it had some value. Knew where it was in the house. There was a degree of thought and intent.\n\nIt's not like this watch fell from the sky. The definition of malice is the intention to do ill will.\n\nHe intended to steal it and stole it. \n\nHence malice.", "Didn\u2019t*\n\nKinda changes the story. Lol\n\nEdit - Yeah the MIL and SIL forced the relapse of anyone \u201ccaused\u201d it. By bring their brother / son to a house where they knew he wasn\u2019t welcome. \n\nThey could have easily done a small thanksgiving at MILs", "I guess I wonder if he knew that the OP was not okay with him being there?   Like, did they try and manipulate the situation.", "If you don\u2019t see a difference between an addict stealing to get a fix, and a thief stealing just for profit, I doubt we\u2019ll get anywhere. \n\nYou\u2019re also adding story that wasn\u2019t there. For all we know, the watch caught his eye in the moment. Which is usually the case with addicts and theft. Crimes born of a combination of opportunity and desperation. You\u2019re implying a lot of planning and intent that probably wasn\u2019t there. Addicts (especially those that cannot afford their addiction) don\u2019t usually make good planners. \n\nYou come across as angry at addicts. Make no mistake, I am not absolving Steven of responsibility. Not at all. But I see behavioural changes (like theft from loved ones) as part of the illness. You seem to want to judge actions alone, without the context of the addiction itself. An addicts brain, particularly if in withdrawal, just functions differently. Consequence is a fuzzy concept at best. \u2018Right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 are similarly far-off ideas. The fix is the only real focus.\n\nI firmly believe that addiction should be treated as a health care issue, not a criminal one. I\u2019m very much for safe injection sites, and access to clean drugs for addicts in programs to get better. \n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of personal experience with addiction. My own, and those of loved ones. I\u2019ve *never* seen anger and punishment help an addict, but compassion can change their world."]}
