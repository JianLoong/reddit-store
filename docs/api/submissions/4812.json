Nigel is also an AH for not putting a stop to this. Firstly, Josie has made it clear what her boundaries are and that she is not interested in a relationship and it is so wrong that the two \"adults\" in this situation are encouraging this boundary stomping behaviour. Secondly, it is so cruel and selfish to continue pushing this behaviour on Millie when she is already so desperate for a connection, for their own end goal. It's just rubbing salt in the wound. I hope both girls end up happy and healthy once they realise how toxic their parents are and distance themselves from their influence.", "NTA. Your sister needed to hear it and take it to heart.
