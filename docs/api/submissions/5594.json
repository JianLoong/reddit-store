All kids hate their parents for one thing or the other. But they never forgive for being exposed to toxicity. Your mom is toxic whether you admit it or not.

This woman isn't owed your time, she's not owed your children's time. You need to put in the work if not for yourself for your kids.

Her reaching out was also during my second pregnancy which is why I didn't confront her then, I wanted to avoid the stress for it is not good for the baby", "I had the same thought many a times. She often tells the story of being pregnant with me on her wedding day, that ended in divorce and a big bruhaha. I believe she blames my existence for her misfortune in choosing her husband at that time...", "I agree with the do and don't part.

For your sake and your kids, it\u2019s best for your mother to stay out of your life for a while.", "You are capable of having a lifetime free of her. You just have to do the work not only within yourself but externally. They will be exposed to such toxicity if you don't learn how to set barriers. If you can't model that behavior for your kids they will probably fall into the same situation as you in the future", "That is true but I don't want to see him suffer, because I owe all of me to him. He was the one who cared for me in my childhood since I was 10, he talked to me always when I needed some advice on big or small things and without him I don't believe I will be the person I am today. I just want to warn him before shit hits the fan...", "Let her know the children won\u2019t speak her language, until she acts like a grandmother.

Ask her to apologize sincerely, if not she can't visit, for what you write in the post it doesn't appear she will do it, least of all sincerely, so till then she can't come, problem delayed.", "That could take some years for her to apologize... Will have the peace of mind in the mean time", "I understand the sentiment, but not teaching them another language now may be a detriment in the future. Also, I think it's a bit sad that you feel you can't share *your* culture with your children bc of one bad apple.", "I think if I were in your shoes I would simply tell mom the truth, matter of factly. You\u2019ve recently had a second child, you did not feel comfortable or safe sharing this with her after your fallout created a lot of stress/grief during your first pregnancy, you\u2019re not sure where your relationship currently stands as you\u2019ve never received closure for what transpired \n\nI think this approach would give you the most clarity as to how you should proceed. Until you have this conversation, you\u2019ll never truly know if your mother would still be a toxic influence or if perhaps, she\u2019s had some clarity of mind and a change of heart given the time and distance. She may actually feel bad about how things ended but doesn\u2019t know how to broach the topic given how long ago it was or maybe she still believes she was in the right (in which case, being open and honest about what the hang up is will absolutely bring to light the kind of person your mother is)\n\nShe may be initially hurt and upset that this information was kept from her and I\u2019d maybe give her some grace to feel those emotions but what you\u2019re looking for once the initial shock wears off is, does she feel remorse for her actions? Does she acknowledge how she contributed to this outcome? Does she apologize for her past actions given the opportunity or does she double down to defend what she did all those years ago?\n\nEither way, the ball will be in your court and you can better decide if you see a future relationship that involves your mother spending time with you and your children or if perhaps the distance, or even going no contact is appropriate. She can be as terrible as she wants to be once the truth is out - you don\u2019t have to pick up the phone to entertain that if you don\u2019t want to.", "Do you mean I am one too, or are you referring to my parents?", "Well we are teaching them English and the dad's mother tongue (country we live in) but to be honest it is not a big deal, for my mother tongue can be only used when we are on vacation back home, which hasn't happened and all other family members don't live there anymore.\n\nI do share my culture and religion with them (not forcing, but explain why I am doing this and that differently) just not the language. Later on if they want I will teach them personally, yes it will be a struggle but right now I see no need for that. My country is unfortunately a dying one, that's why all people flee...", "Damn, didn't think that far. Yeah as much as it pains me to say, that is a huge mistake on my part", "My worst nightmare. Yup I should get my shit together and set a better example for them", "Thank you for the honest suggestion to solve this mess. I am going forward with telling her the truth, after I warn stepdad that is (I owe him that much I know). Wheels are set in motion for the holidays are the most obvious time she reaches out. And to be honest I want to start a new year without that burden that she has put on me, with her attitude and actions so many years ago in my childhood. Time to turn a new page if not for my sake then for my children.", "They were referring to your parents for sure", "I am sorry to hear that your country is so unstable but glad you are open to sharing about it with your children.
