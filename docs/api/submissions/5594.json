I also believe she is trying to fix her life mistakes through me, that is why she doesn't agree with anything else other than her own \"vision\" of my life.\n\nI think that hurt me the most, I see and hear all the time how families are overjoyed and happy to have such news to celebrate,but for her it was the end of the world. I really suspected in that moment that she doesn't genuinely love me, as I believed till then...", "Yup, in general I am trying to protect my kids from her.

All kids hate their parents for one thing or the other. But they never forgive for being exposed to toxicity. Your mom is toxic whether you admit it or not.
