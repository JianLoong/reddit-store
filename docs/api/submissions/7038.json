I (18f) have a twin sister (18f) who\u2019s had the same boyfriend since freshman year. He\u2019s also 18. He comes from a wealthy family, and had a career lined up for him the day he graduated.\n\nMy sister is actually pretty responsible, so is he. Which is why it was a shock to everyone when she revealed she was pregnant. She swears they always used protection, and I believe her. She\u2019s not the type to skip out on that kind of stuff, nor is he.\n\nWell, for obvious reasons she finished senior year via distance learning. The baby was born right after graduation. I should also mention, they are responsible parents, even though they\u2019re young\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, her boyfriend started his new job and they\u2019re about 4 hours away. They moved and have been done for almost 2 weeks now. They agreed to leave the baby here (I still live at home with my mom) while they move everything. I FaceTime my sister everyday and she shows me her daughters room, and it\u2019s beautiful. She tells me how much she misses her.\n\n2 days ago, just over a week of moving my sister told my mom she\u2019s going to come get her. My mom said no and that she abandoned her and that she\u2019s a gold digger. Then her boyfriend called and my mom said the same thing. They\u2019ve been going back and fourth for 2 days.\n\nMy sister called me a few hours ago, and said she\u2019s not playing any more games with Mom, and that tomorrow she\u2019s waking up at 4am, and driving down here to demand her daughter back and if my mom doesn\u2019t give her up she says she\u2019ll get the police involved, get attorneys involved and do whatever it takes to be reunited with her daughter.\n\nAfter that conversation I went downstairs to talk to my mom. I said she should give my sister her daughter back. She said \u201cyour sister abandoned this baby, she doesn\u2019t deserve her\u201d\n\n\nMy mom said my sister is a gold digger and if she wanted her kid she would have got her by now. I reminded her that she does, and I warned my mom that if she doesn\u2019t give it to her nicely my sister is not going to be so nice about it.\n\nBut then my mom said \u201cjust mind your buissness\u201d and to be honest, she kind of had a point. This isn\u2019t my buissness. She also said the baby is what brings her joy and she feels a \u201cspecial connection\u201d with her that she garuntees my sister doesn\u2019t have.\n\nI warned her one last time, \u201cmom, don\u2019t do this, [my sisters name] is not messing around and this will get ugly.\u201d And that was that.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think I was wrong to inject myself. It isn\u2019t my buissness but my sister is right- she deserves her child back and I did witness the conversation of my mom offering to watch the child while the moved.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: it is 8:13 right now where I am, and my sister came and got her daughter. My mom did resist though. She said \u201cyou\u2019re too young to be parents\u201d and gave her the speech about their special connection and my sister said \u201cI\u2019m not leaving this house without my daughter.\u201d Sister threatened to call the police and then mom walked outside to call her friend or something and my sister just went upstairs into my moms room, picked up her daughter, and ran out. She is gone now, but I\u2019m meeting her for breakfast soon while she\u2019s in town.\nMom is crying saying \u201cmy daughter is heartless\u201d and is \u201ctoo young to be a mom.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all, I just wanted you all to know my niece is safely reunited with her mother, and soon her father as well.", "created_utc": 1673419674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108y2zm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_give_my_sister_her/", "score": 5052, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if that time passed, and she doesn't return baby?  That is literally kidnapping.", "NTA. What your mom is doing is called custodial kidnapping. There's a chance your mom could be in serious trouble! You have a right to speak up on this subject. Plus your mom seems to be jealous of your sister and the new baby which makes me wonder if she's have a mental episode or if that's normal?", "NTA and it is your business- that\u2019s your twin and your niece.

When you say \u201cthey agreed to leave the baby here\u201d, I\u2019m assuming you mean that your mother offered to watch her granddaughter while they were in the moving process. Hanging onto the child violates that agreement and the law probably. You standing up for your sister and niece is not an asshole move", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong . It seems like you perceive the sister as responsible, and she legally has custody over the child. This could end in a lawsui.", "NTA. How\u2019s your mom gonna offer to watch the kiddo while they move then try to switch it up and say they abandoned her? Sounds like your mom has some major control issues.

It seems unlikely that your sister just up and left without explanation I'm assuming it was agreed that her and her boyfriend were moving and your mother was going to take care of the baby while they moved and got settled? \nThat's clearly not abandonment. Your mother wouldn't have a leg to stand on. \n\nHonestly if I were your sister I would have come as soon as she refused the first time and not entertained the back and forth, but being young it's hard to know what to do. \n\nShe has absolutely every right to involve the police and a clear story of what is going on that would very quickly result in your mum being made to give her back and possibly even be arrested.", "You are NTA for getting involved.

Your sister may want to get the police involved and get her daughter back before your mom does something drastic and files for custody of your niece!", "NTA. Your mother offered to watch the child while they moved. What she's doing trying to keep the baby is illegal. Your sister should get the police involved if she won't give the baby back. As a witness, you are already involved. \n\nAnd I have no idea what the gold digger comment is about as it doesn't apply at all in this situation. Your mother may need help - she's not thinking clearly at all.", "NTA. Your mother has basically kidnapped your niece.  Does your sister have any communication between her and your mother that she can use as proof that she didn\u2019t abandon the baby?

Your mother is mentally I\u2019ll, she\u2019s decided that child is her new baby and will rationalise it any way she can. Support your sister in this before her child gets taken by a nut job.", "NTA. You spoke your piece, now all you need to do is step back and watch events take their inevitable course. You say the guy comes from a family with money? Well, most likely that money will be used to buy a good attorney, who will serve your mother with the usual papers, served by the sheriff, along with your sister leading a parade of deputies and social workers, out in front of the door, in full view of the neighbors, and possibly even the news media. You did nothing wrong, though your mother will probably find a way to blame you. Sorry all this is happening.", "Can you possibly sneak out with the baby and stay at a hotel?
