But if that time passed, and she doesn't return baby?  That is literally kidnapping.", "NTA. What your mom is doing is called custodial kidnapping. There's a chance your mom could be in serious trouble! You have a right to speak up on this subject.

When you say \u201cthey agreed to leave the baby here\u201d, I\u2019m assuming you mean that your mother offered to watch her granddaughter while they were in the moving process. Hanging onto the child violates that agreement and the law probably. You standing up for your sister and niece is not an asshole move", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong .

Your mother wouldn't have a leg to stand on. \n\nHonestly if I were your sister I would have come as soon as she refused the first time and not entertained the back and forth, but being young it's hard to know what to do. \n\nShe has absolutely every right to involve the police and a clear story of what is going on that would very quickly result in your mum being made to give her back and possibly even be arrested.", "You are NTA for getting involved.

Your sister may want to get the police involved and get her daughter back before your mom does something drastic and files for custody of your niece!", "NTA. Your mother offered to watch the child while they moved. What she's doing trying to keep the baby is illegal. Your sister should get the police involved if she won't give the baby back.

Your mother may need help - she's not thinking clearly at all.", "NTA. Your mother has basically kidnapped your niece.  Does your sister have any communication between her and your mother that she can use as proof that she didn\u2019t abandon the baby?

Your mother is mentally I\u2019ll, she\u2019s decided that child is her new baby and will rationalise it any way she can. Support your sister in this before her child gets taken by a nut job.", "NTA. You spoke your piece, now all you need to do is step back and watch events take their inevitable course. You say the guy comes from a family with money? Well, most likely that money will be used to buy a good attorney, who will serve your mother with the usual papers, served by the sheriff, along with your sister leading a parade of deputies and social workers, out in front of the door, in full view of the neighbors, and possibly even the news media. You did nothing wrong, though your mother will probably find a way to blame you. Sorry all this is happening.", "Can you possibly sneak out with the baby and stay at a hotel?

You're NTA, OP. Your mom is a massive AH for trying to deny your sister her baby. She is way out of line.", "Scary and unhinged!!", "That's some 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' shit right there. OP needs to rescue her niece from what could turn into a really REALLY bad situation. NTA", "It sounds like she should, because she plans on sticking with the kidnapping.", "Yeah this is absolutely one of those times where you need to let your sister know that she needs to be showing up with the cops ASAP to come get the baby, and you need to be trailing your mother so when that confrontation happens she can't lock herself alone in the room with the baby or try to run", "Adding to this OP is living in a house with what could end up being deemed as a kidnapped child. She needs to get involved for her own sake as well", "I agree, the grandma shouldn\u2019t have any more warnings than this in case she does something silly like fleeing. NTA OP Tell your sister everything verbally and in written form email/text so she has it as evidence to show the police. You don\u2019t need to be harsh but quoting grandma directly and advising that she seems unwell and irrational about handing the baby back and says she will refuse will hopefully be sufficient. \nSister should go in hard and bring the police to show she means business, no silly arguments or nonsense, just \u201cI have come to pick up my baby\u201d.\nIf your sister doesn\u2019t have the birth certificate etc with her then find it in the house and keep it on you for when sister arrives with the police to pick up her baby and confirm to them that the time has been agreed and you and your mother taking care of the baby was for a set period only. Have your ID ready and proof of address as well as your sister. I have my fingers crossed for you, please update if you are able.", "That was my thought as well - OP, can you sneak the baby out so your sister can meet you, without endangering yourself and your own living security? Would your sister/the baby's paternal family help you if you did?", "You are not the a****** your mother is", "If they have a financial backup from their well-off parents then they can. It's a privilege ofcourse but it's not abnormal.", "I will be watching this true crime documentary in 10 years", "Every kidnapping-murder/suicide has to start somewhere, after all", "This isn't the best advice. If you say that there is a chance that she will never see her granddaughter again, she can feel threatened and do something even more radical to stop it from happening. She is already doubling down on her opinion.", "Don\u2019t remind mom of anything. Tell your sister to come immediately and get her child. Bring a police escort and a birth certificate. Don\u2019t talk to your mom anymore about this. \n\nYour mom is unstable and is trying to steal your niece. Tell your sister to come today. Immediately. Don\u2019t delay.", ">there's a good chance your sister, who will win, will go NC with her mom and she'll never see her grandchild again. \n\nHonestly, I think we're past that point. This woman is not safe to be around her grandchild. I hope OP has the ability to get out soon as well.", "Yes this could very ugly without being mean it sounds like grandmother has had a breakdown or something and feels the baby is her. \n\nIt will just be bad as the baby is obviously the sisters but also in a legal sense as long as she hasn\u2019t made the grandmother, godmother or legal guardian in her (sisters) absence. The grandmother has been a baby sitter so she will have to give the baby up but I would certainly have police or some kind of authority there. \n\nI would say Op should try to get the baby away from the grandmother and to her sister. Neither have legal claim so as long as the baby gets to it\u2019s mother that\u2019s most important thing.", "I feel a little bad for the mom because she clearly loves this baby and it sounds like she\u2019s about to be an empty nester which may have pushed her into a mental health crisis. But she is about to torch her relationship with her daughters.", "Scary.  Do you know why??  This behavior is clearly not totally uncommon, but it seems so unhinged.  I'm  so sorry you had to experience this.", "Hopefully not because she was a guest of the state due to kidnapping charges.", "This is the way.", "Yeah for real!! She needs to make sure she can be a witness if anything. At the minimum, she needs to be available by phone.", "Even a week would be hard to claim abandonment. Especially when it's proven that they were moving and have a baby room ready and prepared.", "Yeah OP is a witness at this point and should be prepared to give statements to the police.", "Indeed, the poster needs to stay involved for the protection the baby at this point.", "I don\u2019t think mom is thinking. I think mom is feeling. And mom may be having some sort of mental break, but she ain\u2019t thinking.", "I totally meant to comment my response on a totally different thread. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSorry!\n\n**Disclosure:** I am not a morning person.", "I imagine your mum will just get a few stern words from the police unless she kicks up a fuss and that is on her.", "Don't post anything there. It's run by shady cops and any advice from actual lawyers gets deleted.", "Or maybe a rational discussion about the facts may help her mom wake the FU and come back to reality.  OP knows her mom best and will take whatever advice she deems is best suited to her situation, it may be mine, it may be someone elses.  it's a suggested approach", "But definitely tell the sister! That way, she knows OP is on her side if she needs to involve the cops.", "Ideally OP should pick up the kid while grandma is asleep and hand it off to her sister in the middle of the night. Definitely best that the crazy Grandma comes to the realization that she's not going to be able to keep the baby while the baby is nowhere near her", "I agree. OP - tell your sister to go to the police department, first. \n\nOr, better - if the father is as wealthy as you say, the parents should pick up his family lawyer and then the three of them should go pick up a cop.\n\nOP, it is your business in the sense that if your mom loses her shit, do you have a place you can stay?\n\nNTA", "u/WiseTrainer2624 Read this please, tell your sister to come with Law enforcement.
