But if that time passed, and she doesn't return baby?  That is literally kidnapping.", "NTA. What your mom is doing is called custodial kidnapping. There's a chance your mom could be in serious trouble! You have a right to speak up on this subject.

When you say \u201cthey agreed to leave the baby here\u201d, I\u2019m assuming you mean that your mother offered to watch her granddaughter while they were in the moving process. Hanging onto the child violates that agreement and the law probably. You standing up for your sister and niece is not an asshole move", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong .

Your mother wouldn't have a leg to stand on. \n\nHonestly if I were your sister I would have come as soon as she refused the first time and not entertained the back and forth, but being young it's hard to know what to do. \n\nShe has absolutely every right to involve the police and a clear story of what is going on that would very quickly result in your mum being made to give her back and possibly even be arrested.", "You are NTA for getting involved.

Your sister may want to get the police involved and get her daughter back before your mom does something drastic and files for custody of your niece!", "NTA. Your mother offered to watch the child while they moved. What she's doing trying to keep the baby is illegal. Your sister should get the police involved if she won't give the baby back.

Your mother may need help - she's not thinking clearly at all.", "NTA. Your mother has basically kidnapped your niece.  Does your sister have any communication between her and your mother that she can use as proof that she didn\u2019t abandon the baby?

Your mother is mentally I\u2019ll, she\u2019s decided that child is her new baby and will rationalise it any way she can. Support your sister in this before her child gets taken by a nut job.", "NTA. You spoke your piece, now all you need to do is step back and watch events take their inevitable course. You say the guy comes from a family with money? Well, most likely that money will be used to buy a good attorney, who will serve your mother with the usual papers, served by the sheriff, along with your sister leading a parade of deputies and social workers, out in front of the door, in full view of the neighbors, and possibly even the news media. You did nothing wrong, though your mother will probably find a way to blame you. Sorry all this is happening.", "Can you possibly sneak out with the baby and stay at a hotel?
