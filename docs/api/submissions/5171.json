You are court mandated to have 50/50 custody, but if she has him 5/7 of the time, that isn't 50/50 and you are in violation of the court order.  Though there is certainly a degree of respecting your teenager's wishes by letting him spend more time at the mom's place, you are putting yourself at potential risk to have her re-open the custody dispute and ask for child support if you aren't meeting the 50/50 requirement.", "Only $150 a month?   Pay it and be thankful, that figure would be a hell of a lot higher if it were court enforced support.  YTA.", "NTA but you're on a little bit of thin ice if you don't step in to make sure your son is being provided for in some way. \n\nIf you only live a short way apart, perhaps he could eat at yours more while staying more often there? That would share things a bit better while he retains his freedom. Just a thought.", "So, I see some people saying YTA because you should feed your kid- but as far as I can tell, you are? You provide them with food while they're at your place, and because of your custody arrangement, it's up to your wife to provide for him while he's at hers. \n\nI'm going to say NTA here. Because you are doing your job and providing for your kid an your house, and she needs to do her job and provide for him while he's with her (INFO: she isn't providing him food at home? Because they go out to eat a lot?).", "NTA. Kid wants to stay home alone. He isn\u2019t starving. Op is blocks away with food. I\u2019m sure the kid could have dinner and then go relax in his empty house a few blocks away. He could probably walk over for a snack in a few minutes. Or drive over if he has his license.", "NTA but you should definitely talk to your son and work something out with him. He needs to eat so make sure that he does and if that means he needs to stay with you instead of his moms house all by himself then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to do.", "NAH you\u2019re well within your rights to say no based on your custody agreement but you could still help out and be a decent person to make sure your kid is eating. It\u2019s not an unreasonable ask that you give some money toward food for your son since he\u2019s not spending the time at your home.", "NTA I get that he enjoys it there more for obvious reasons but it comes with consequences. You provide him access to food and he chooses another route. Good for him but he is old enough to learn that choices are a privilege we all have to finance ourselves. If he\u2019s at his mothers and wants dinner he can at least walk over and have dinner with your/his family.", "NAH\n\nThe court has spoken, and the child is old enough that going back to court is pointless.  The kid can always come eat at your place, which he probably doesn't want to do. She's allowing him to violate the custody agreement, and the additional costs are on her to absorb. She can always go back to the agreement if she's unwilling to continue with this slight increase in costs.", "NTA. You think she'd be happy to have him home more. He's old enough to decide where he went to stay. $150 extra per month for one person staying there a bit more frequently seems like a lie or she's just constantly eating out, like you said. You could directly ask her to tell your son she doesn't think extra time together is worth $150 and see if that changes her perspective since that obviously a terrible thing but is basically how she's viewing it when you get down to it.", "Why don\u2019t you just give your son the $150 to spend on food if he\u2019s the one that wants to be there? NTA.", "Info: can you buy groceries directly for the kid or even get groceries delivered? That way you know what the money is being used for.", "YTA. If he is there during your parenting time, then he is still your responsibility.

Of course he wants to be away from 3 siblings. If you\u2019d stayed with his mom and had three more kids, he would still be choosing to stay in his room away from his siblings. But he doesn\u2019t get that choice because you got divorced.\n\nYou and your wife are the ones who are bound to the custody agreement, but your son is not. You\u2019re just making this harder on your son who at the age of 16, is still having to deal with the dynamics of split parents.", "INFO: does your son have his own private space in your house? His own room? \n\nRegardless YTA and you better hope she doesn't take you to court because you're going to be paying a hell of a lot more than $150 a month.
