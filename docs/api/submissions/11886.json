You are what is the definition of beind a single mother. Being poor is not the same as being a single parent. Think your coworker is just jealous that you had so good support and she hasn't.

Distance yourself from this person", "NTA! Um, there is no other parent in the picture so you are most definitely a single mother.

You may have been lucky enough not to have to worry about the financial hardships, but you still have to deal with all the crap that all of us put up with - being the one who picks the kid up from school when they're sick, being the only one who can clean up after them, discipline them, deal with their bad moods, etc. Like you, I was lucky enough to have parents who could help me financially, but they couldn't go to parent-teacher conferences or take care of him at 2am when he was sick. And when my son was 16 and going through his asshole phase (as just about all 16-year-old boys do) I was the one who had to put up with it day in and day out - if that doesn't make us single moms, then I don't know what does!", "Well, you are single, yes?

Even if the father alternated custody and/or paid child support, you'd still be a single mom.\n\nYou're not a \"struggling single mom\" but you never claimed to be.

That doesn\u2019t negate the fact you\u2019re a single mom.", "NTA. Does she not understand what single means? It means you are not dating anyone.

Call yourself single mom as its what you are and don't worry too much about the entitlement of some people who feel 'single motherhood' is some sort of trophy where they can get sympathy from others and someone have to earn it by skipping meals and being poor. Enjoy the life you have and just block the toxic ones who thinks otherwise.

As a former single mom, I had support from family (I know this might not always be the case for other single moms). Every single mom has different struggles, some more than other.

You\u2019re not in the wrong here and I don\u2019t blame you for being upset.", "NTA, single mom means \"single\" and \"mom\", there's no income level attached to the simple words.  why your coworker decided it was her role to gatekeep the phrase, I don't think we'll ever know.", "I think I\u2019m just astonished that someone is out here _gatekeeping_ single motherhood.

Grandparents helped, family helped, my dad helped, but who was there for me every day from sunrise to sunset, worrying about homework and school and shoesizes and not having a partner to share this responsibility with - my mom.

You know, glass half full and all that. I was a single mom for a time myself, and although I can relate to some of what she said, I also would never throw it back on someone else because I'm jealous of how I *perceive* their life to be better than mine.

ITS NOT A COMPETITION", "That would be a more precise term yes, but it's certainly not a common one. I'm still referring to the ubiquitous understanding of the term \"single mother\". Perhaps it's outdated language, holding over from a time when divorce was less common and mothers of children born out of wedlock were ostracized. I agree that it's not a completely accurate or precise term, but pretending that's not what people generally understand it to mean is disingenuous.\n\nETA: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Mother", "Nobody said it was. It's not about the amount or degree of struggle, it's about the fact that material support is not coming from *the other parent* specifically.

Just as a divorced parent who shares custody is not a \"single parent\" *even if* they are struggling badly.", "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Mother", "The irony you are calling other pedantic hahahha", "Yep. Not sure why people get so heated over the \"right\" to refer to themselves this way. We all (including Wikipedia) understand the connotation. It's not about the *degree* of struggle or support - it's about whether or not support is *specifically* coming from the other parent. OP is NTA because the *father* is not involved in supporting or parenting their kid.

If someone were in a co-parenting relationship but wasn\u2019t in a romantic relationship, they could still call themselves single parents, but \u201cunmarried/uncoupled/unpartnered\u201d parent would probably be more accurate, though it\u2019s odd/very uncommon terminology.\n\nWhen I hear single parent, I think \u201cperson who is the sole parent of a child\u201d.

Single mother doesn\u2019t automatically mean struggle", "> The same goes for \"single mom\" or \"single dad\"- they are not merely \"un-partnered parents\".\n\nSingle mom and single dad are, in fact, merely unpartnered parents. \n\nThe opposite of single isn\u2019t rich.

That's not being a single mom, that's being a poor parent. We were on WIC and food stamps, the kid was on Medicaid. Every penny of birthday and Christmas money from my parents went to bills and buying things for the kid. Being a single parent means you don't get breaks, you don't have a partner who can take over when you're sick, you don't get to tag out when you're frustrated, you have to be the one at every appointment.

No matter how involved the other parent is, if a parent is running a home w kid/s by themselves, they are a single parent, no matter if they have a cooperative coparent or not.\n\nETA: OP was also a single parent under her parents\u2019 roof. Bc the reason she was there is bc she is a single parent. As a single parent, she has to be resourceful & ask for help when you need it. That\u2019s what she did.

Suffering Olympics is so annoying. If we have to compare ourselves constantly to the one person in the world who suffers the most, no one is really suffering (except for that one person at any time)? It's just so pointless, just because someone else has it worse, it doesn't mean what we've gone through doesn't matter.\n\nI'm disabled, quite severely ill and housebound, and still people without disabilities sometimes think it's appropriate to tell me that I should be grateful it isn't something worse! Like \"At least it's not cancer!\", as if I'm somehow now safe from ever getting another illness, or as if this chronic illness with no cure, no medicine, is fine just because it's not cancer? \nOK, so I guess you go around being grateful every day about not being sick at all? No? Didn't think so. It's not like I go around complaining endlessly, but just telling someone about my life can get that reaction. \n\nIronically, studies have shown that people like me (with chronic illnesses, not sure if the studies were specific to my illness or more general, but it's true for ME/CFS at least ) are more likely to die from cancer than someone previously healthy. Most likely because we and our health care providers don't recognise that the symptoms are from a new illness, not just the same old. So we're less likely to seek help straight away, and when we do go to the doctor they wave us off saying it's just part of the illness you have. So diagnosis is later which leads to worse outcomes. Probably doesn't help to have an already weak body and immune system either.\n\nSo I've been housebound since I was 24, in severe pain every day, can barely take care of myself, but at least I don't have cancer.
