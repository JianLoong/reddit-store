You are what is the definition of beind a single mother. Being poor is not the same as being a single parent. Think your coworker is just jealous that you had so good support and she hasn't.

Distance yourself from this person", "NTA! Um, there is no other parent in the picture so you are most definitely a single mother.

You may have been lucky enough not to have to worry about the financial hardships, but you still have to deal with all the crap that all of us put up with - being the one who picks the kid up from school when they're sick, being the only one who can clean up after them, discipline them, deal with their bad moods, etc. Like you, I was lucky enough to have parents who could help me financially, but they couldn't go to parent-teacher conferences or take care of him at 2am when he was sick. And when my son was 16 and going through his asshole phase (as just about all 16-year-old boys do) I was the one who had to put up with it day in and day out - if that doesn't make us single moms, then I don't know what does!", "Well, you are single, yes?

Even if the father alternated custody and/or paid child support, you'd still be a single mom.\n\nYou're not a \"struggling single mom\" but you never claimed to be.

That doesn\u2019t negate the fact you\u2019re a single mom.", "NTA. Does she not understand what single means? It means you are not dating anyone.

Enjoy the life you have and just block the toxic ones who thinks otherwise.

As a former single mom, I had support from family (I know this might not always be the case for other single moms). Every single mom has different struggles, some more than other.

You\u2019re not in the wrong here and I don\u2019t blame you for being upset.", "NTA, single mom means \"single\" and \"mom\", there's no income level attached to the simple words.  why your coworker decided it was her role to gatekeep the phrase, I don't think we'll ever know.", "I think I\u2019m just astonished that someone is out here _gatekeeping_ single motherhood.

I was raised by a single mom - my parents divorced and my dad was still in our life, but I was raised by a single mom. Grandparents helped, family helped, my dad helped, but who was there for me every day from sunrise to sunset, worrying about homework and school and shoesizes and not having a partner to share this responsibility with - my mom.

You know, glass half full and all that. I was a single mom for a time myself, and although I can relate to some of what she said, I also would never throw it back on someone else because I'm jealous of how I *perceive* their life to be better than mine.
