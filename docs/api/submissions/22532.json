{"id": 22532, "submission_id": "152magn", "title": "AITA for abruptly leaving my In Laws after the dinner table conversation turned explicit in front of my kids?", "selftext": "I (31F) am married to the oldest son (33M) of 7 children. We have 2 children ages 10 and 7. My husband I are very close with his family, and regularly get invited over for dinner, along with all of his siblings. We are currently the only ones with kids.\n\n Unfortunately, one of my brother in laws has a tendency to not censor himself in front of children. He and I got into a heated argument over this when my husband and I were dating because now brother in law was speaking very sexually explicit in front of one of their younger siblings. He made it clear that he didn't give 2 shits and he was going to say whatever he wanted to say, in front of whoever he wanted. This habit has not changed since my husband and I have had children. I usually make sure my kids stay out of the room whenever that particular uncle has also been invited to dinner.\n\nRecently we were invited over for dinner, along with all of my husband's siblings. My husband was unable to come with us due to work. It is not out of the norm for myself and the kids to go to my in laws by ourselves, so this is entire scenario is completely normal. Usually once everyone arrives, we eat dinner, have dessert, and once the kids leave the room, the adults talk freely without censoring themselves. Great, right?\n\nThis particular night, however, that was not how things went. As we were all still eating, the conversation between my father in law and the aforementioned brother in law turned incredibly explicit out of nowhere. Without getting into too much detail, the conversation was along the lines of how horrible it is that different cultures commit a very specific form of abuse(r word) on small children, and the differences in how it's done to little girls versus little boys. There was not even an attempt on their parts to censor anything they were saying. Needless to say, I was HORRIFIED and quickly told my kids to leave the room. They hadn't even finished their dinner. \n\nAs I sat there, my blood began to boil and I knew it was time for us to leave. Long story short, we left without saying goodbye to all but a couple of people. My mother in law knew I was furious and tried to defuse things with me privately. I let her know that while it's not my place to tell people how they can and can't speak in their own house, I was disgusted at the fact that it was the adults at the table that refused to censor themselves long enough for my kids to at least finish their dinner before being banished from the main part of the house. So rather than making a scene, it was time for us to leave.\n\nSince everything happened, there has been little to no communication with my in laws. My husband is 100% in agreement with how I feel, and is pretty shocked by his parent's response to all this. But I'm now wondering if I overreacted. So AITA? \n*Edited to add more clarification to the topic being discussed at the dinner table!", "created_utc": 1689649015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152magn/aita_for_abruptly_leaving_my_in_laws_after_the/", "score": 368, "replies": ["NTA\n\nI\u2019m not a prude.

(And possibly escalate to not coming over in the first place.)\n\n*\"Thanks for the invite, MIL, but since BIL has repeatedly refused to speak in a way that is age appropriate around my kids, we won't be joining you this time.\"*\n\nIf they don't care about that consequence, it says a lot about where you stand with them.\n\nYou are not controlling their behavior. You are telling them what *your response* will be. To amend the behavior or not is their choice. \n\nAnd THAT is healthy and appropriate boundary enforcement.", "NTA.\n\nBut your parents are totally assholes for not putting your BIL in his place for doing this in front of your kids. Their house, their rules, they could easily ask HIM to leave instead.", "NTA. That's a totally understandable reaction. It's not cool when adults can't censor themselves in front of kids, especially after you've had previous discussions about it. You did the right thing by removing your children from that explicit conversation and deciding to leave. Your main concern was the well-being of your kids, and it's important to prioritize that. It's unfortunate that there has been little communication since then, but it's important to establish boundaries and protect your children. Trust your instincts on this one.", "Wow. That's amazingly self-centered behavior on your FIL's part.\n\nYou are NTA. I hope your children were at least allowed to take their dinner with them and finish eating in a different room.\n\nSounds like you and your husband need to go LC with his family. Declining future dinner invitations unless and until either FIL apologizes or your children turn 18 seems reasonable IMO, because you can't trust him to behave appropriately in front of your children.\n\nYou've acknowledged that it's his house and he can do what he wants, but it's not okay to expose your kids to that topic around the dinner table at their ages.\n\nETA: If the topic was simply sex between consenting adults, that would be one thing. Talking about sex crimes against children is completely different. That topic could make your kids feel unsafe. FIL needs to be less hung up about his freedoms as a grown adult and more concerned about his responsibilities as a grandfather to help take care of his grandkids.", "NTA. But also, what kind of dinner conversation is that and why would someone decide that\u2019s a good topic to discuss while eating food? It\u2019s brainless and insensitive behaviour on the part of FIL and BIL, and there\u2019s nothing you did wrong in this situation. I\u2019m surprised the rest of the family isn\u2019t disgusted by their behaviour/conversation. You gotta protect your kids. Full stop. You did just that. MIL knew it was wrong, your hubby knew it was wrong, and I think you did the right thing. If anything, it sounds like you left without making a scene and so they\u2019ve really got nothing to complain about.", "NTA - your reactions were spot on.  The kids would not be around BIL for the foreseeable future.", "\n\u201cSince everything happened, there has been little to no communication with my in laws.\u201d\n\nProblem solved. NTA.", "NTA. I would have walked out even if it was just me and I'm old. Who the hell discusses this at dinner and has multicultural reference knowledge of child rape? This is creepy beyond words. I wouldn't go near the IL with my kids after that. Why would they even KNOW this stuff???", "NTA. Uncle and the family sound like they need some class. We take two cars to all family events so I can bounce if family drama happens! Good luck with that- what\u2019s your husband doing here??", "NTA. What on earth is wrong with his entire family???? I\u2019m an open, liberal parent who believes in discussing the news of the day and politics at dinner, including listening to my child even as they form really basic beliefs. This? It\u2019s beyond obnoxious, and on the verge of total ignorance to child development. While I am happy to discuss genital mutilation amongst adults, even with only adults, I\u2019m not doing that at dinner. These people are absolutely ridiculous and need to respect boundaries. Yeesh.", "NTA and I don't think I would ever be willing to spend any time with people who think that's a subject to be discussed over dinner.", "NTA. That is NOT normal dinner conversation for any family. What the heck is wrong with them?", "I would like the address what seems to be a common idea of what the graphic conversation was about. It was not something simple like circumcision. They were speaking about a very specific form of abuse (gr@p3), and the way in which it is done to small children in certain cultures. They spared no details!", "NTA.  Your wanting the conversation to be G-rated while children were at the table is totally reasonable and everyone there knew this was important to you.  You took the right stand and left early with your children, choosing not to make a scene.  You did exactly what I would have done.  Your BIL is the AH here and your FIL too, I'm afraid.", "NTA.  You are the momma bear.  You protect the cubs.  They are fortunate you did not educate them on manners.  Your spouse concurs with your defense.  Even his mommy knew it was improper.  You are 100% right.  At least now it has been established that the in-laws are untrustworthy and the only defense is distance.  Good for you.", "NTA- your kids come first.", "You are NTA and you are totally correct. You can't comtrol what they do or say, you can only control your reaction. Which was to remove your kids from the situation.\n\nI'd make it very clear that from now on this is what will happen if they can't censor themselves around the kids and if that doesn't work, it's time to stop having family gatherings with them.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou are a good parent for protecting your children from explicit things at such a young age. The in-laws should respect that if there are children present. It's definitely a common sense kind of thing. What kind of person would be inappropriate around kids and not even worry about it? It's good that you are aware of the children and don't only think of yourself. Keep being amazing!!!", "NTA - I have walked my self from both my family and my wife's and I am vocal about it.  holler at the kids \"Lets go! we're heading home\" No explanation, no discussion.  Did this at one of the Christmas gatherings because my BIL kept on saying that Santa was fake. Thankfully my kids just left the dinner table but I didn't want to risk them hearing this rant.  Asked him to stop and he refused so after 5 minutes, I just got up told my wife we are leaving. Packed everyone up and left.\n\nShe was pissed until I explained what happened and Won't return until her brother know not to voice his opinions about his beliefs when it comes to kid things because they have friends that talk about this stuff like what they got from Santa and what not. They were only 3, 6 and 8 at the time.", "NTA.", "NTA \u2014 edited answer after added context. \n\nOld answer:\nIf you don\u2019t want your kids around adult convos then you need to seat them at a separate kids table. I\u2019m assuming he was discussing circumcision? At 7 and 10\u2026 shouldn\u2019t your kids know what circumcision is? Maybe this is a cultural difference on my part\u2026 but literally the entire family and friends watch a bris. I don\u2019t think this is an inappropriate convo topic. I think you overreacted but maybe unpack why this is so emotionally triggering for you?

Shielding children from the real world does them no favors, but neither does exposing them to horrors that even most adults would rather not be aware of.\n\nThere is also the issue of how it was being discussed. Was the discussion sympathetic to the victims of these crimes or was it titillating in nature? I think anyone exposed to a truly sympathetic discussion, while feeling revulsion for the topic, would also feel sympathy and empathy for the victims and reluctantly allow the opportunity to grow in their knowledge of the world and its different cultures. They would also mourn the innocence that has been brutally stolen from these children. Were the discussion salacious in nature -- hard no, there is no place, absolutely no place that that discussion is acceptable. Ever. Regardless of how the subject was being discussed, it is not a discussion to have in front of children, and anyone who would think it was appropriate is an idiot. I would be reassessing the persons involved in the discussion and vowing to avoid them at all costs and certainly never leaving my children alone with them.\n\nThe reaction of the MIL is puzzling.
