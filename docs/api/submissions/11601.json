It is so important that people advocate for children\u2019s safety, regardless of adults\u2019 feelings getting hurt. Children cannot protect themselves and any child who is in the care system has probably already suffered enough abuse. For them to end up in an abusive household again would be unforgivable. His wife probably doesn\u2019t understand because she hasn\u2019t seen that side of him and hopefully she never will.

And see why the new wife is mad but she doesn\u2019t know your story and even if she does, I\u2019m sure ex hubby has painted himself in a far different light. There\u2019s a reason they ask the ex and you weren\u2019t being spiteful.", "NTA. You told the truth when asked direct questions, nothing more.", "NTA. You didn't get them rejected, your ex did. When it comes to child services? Telling the truth is *never* the AH thing to do.\n\nLet the wife be bitter and angry. If she wants to misplace her anger on to you instead of the own husband, let her.\n\nKeep your kids home, it's not going to be safe for them with two resentful adults.", "NTA. All you did is what you had to to keep innocent kids and women safe. This is your ex facing consequences that he brought on himself with his actions. The only person his current partner should be mad at is him", "NTA. Child services asked, and you told them the truth. You didn\u2019t try to slander him\u2014you just literally told them what you and your kids had gone through in that relationship. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason child services asks past partners these questions in the first place, and you did the right thing by letting them know.", "NTA Protecting a child is not wrong.", "NTA You didn't lie, you didn't exaggerate.

You saved a child, and that's both incredible and heroic.", "INFO: How do you know you had anything to do with it?

Dang my heart broke as I read the sentence in your post saying \"He couldn't stand me loving my children\". I felt the same way about my stbxh. He hates the fact that I love the kids the way I do and that they love me. It's weird bc I never wanted to admit that. But seeing your post really hit hard. Thank you for being an advocating for the potential kid that could have been placed with them.", "Your ex husbands behavior & abuse is what led him to not get approved for the adoption or whatever. She asked you a question & you told her the trust. NTA", "She actually doesn't believe he was abusive at all. When she first reached out to me I told her what happened to warn her and she called me a liar", "I have no idea if it was me. It could have been anything but I'm the one being abused about it \n\nStepmother actually accused me of lying to them first because it couldnt have been anything that did \ud83d\ude44 and I just said I  didn't lie about our marriage and that's when she went off.", "They aren't in danger and it's what they want. I'm not going to withhold them from their dad. I was also with him for a long long time I know he is safe and won't hurt them right now. If he lived with us? He would hurt them. If stepmother wasn't there visits would be supervised but with stepmother there they aren't in danger and that won't change for now", "I\u2019m guessing your ex can be extremely charming if he wants to be. You absolutely did the right thing.", "Classic narcissistic victim....", "I've dealt with child services many times, and at least in my area... you don't get to know who they talk to, unless those people spill the beans themselves.

I don't blame her for not believing me even though it's frustrating he's an extremely manipulative person", "I didn't know that.

The prospective adoptive parents know to whom the SW will speak.", "I understand. My father is the same way.

If he starts abusing her she might be able to break away faster because you warned her.", "Maybe they're case is different, but it would be pretty odd for them to be told that they were denied based on anything that you had to say... it's not unusual for exes to be malicious, so the applicant would have just gotten a very brief one sentence \"approved or declined\" statement - but no details that could be used to retaliate. Maybe your area is different... just sounds odd though.", "You're not the OP...", "Hopefully! She has all my details and I always answer her calls even if it's not the nicest experience just so she knows she can come to me if she needs to and I'll never turn her away. I think she is safe though knowing his patterns she will be safe as long as she doesn't have children and my children are safe as long as she is there", "I know. I was just explaining why the PAPs probably knew that OP talked to the SW."]}
