This man should not have any more kids. Ever. Not just to protect the child but to protect his wife. Once I had my first daughter that was it he went from loving husband to a demon.

I just told them exactly what went down in our marriage and afterwards. She asked if I thought he had changed and I said no. He just has a new fixation. He isn't a changed man he just isn't interested in me or my children enough to harm us anymore. That's the truth behind why we are safe now. My children go to his house because he is rich and let's them do what they want with minimal supervision and then buys them whatever they ask for to keep them happy.

It is so important that people advocate for children\u2019s safety, regardless of adults\u2019 feelings getting hurt. Children cannot protect themselves and any child who is in the care system has probably already suffered enough abuse. For them to end up in an abusive household again would be unforgivable. His wife probably doesn\u2019t understand because she hasn\u2019t seen that side of him and hopefully she never will.

All you did is what you had to to keep innocent kids and women safe. This is your ex facing consequences that he brought on himself with his actions.

Dang my heart broke as I read the sentence in your post saying \"He couldn't stand me loving my children\". I felt the same way about my stbxh. He hates the fact that I love the kids the way I do and that they love me. It's weird bc I never wanted to admit that. But seeing your post really hit hard. Thank you for being an advocating for the potential kid that could have been placed with them.", "Your ex husbands behavior & abuse is what led him to not get approved for the adoption or whatever. She asked you a question & you told her the trust. NTA", "She actually doesn't believe he was abusive at all. When she first reached out to me I told her what happened to warn her and she called me a liar", "I have no idea if it was me. It could have been anything but I'm the one being abused about it \n\nStepmother actually accused me of lying to them first because it couldnt have been anything that did \ud83d\ude44 and I just said I  didn't lie about our marriage and that's when she went off.", "They aren't in danger and it's what they want. I'm not going to withhold them from their dad. I was also with him for a long long time I know he is safe and won't hurt them right now. If he lived with us? He would hurt them. If stepmother wasn't there visits would be supervised but with stepmother there they aren't in danger and that won't change for now", "I\u2019m guessing your ex can be extremely charming if he wants to be. You absolutely did the right thing.", "Classic narcissistic victim....", "I've dealt with child services many times, and at least in my area... you don't get to know who they talk to, unless those people spill the beans themselves. The new wife was probably just trying to goad you into confessing.", "Very much so. I don't blame her for not believing me even though it's frustrating he's an extremely manipulative person", "I didn't know that. She said she knew they were going to call me after the interview with the kids", "The SW was doing the home study for an adoption. The prospective adoptive parents know to whom the SW will speak.", "I understand. My father is the same way. When I told people about the abuse they believed me until they met him. \n\nIt\u2019s still a good thing you warned her. If he starts abusing her she might be able to break away faster because you warned her.", "Maybe they're case is different, but it would be pretty odd for them to be told that they were denied based on anything that you had to say... it's not unusual for exes to be malicious, so the applicant would have just gotten a very brief one sentence \"approved or declined\" statement - but no details that could be used to retaliate. Maybe your area is different... just sounds odd though.", "You're not the OP...", "Hopefully! She has all my details and I always answer her calls even if it's not the nicest experience just so she knows she can come to me if she needs to and I'll never turn her away. I think she is safe though knowing his patterns she will be safe as long as she doesn't have children and my children are safe as long as she is there", "I know. I was just explaining why the PAPs probably knew that OP talked to the SW.", "INFO: Why on EARTH are you going OUTSIDE THE COURTS to allow UNSUPERVISED OVERNIGHT CUSTODY to a man you call a \"demon\" that you had to escape from????", "Huh. Sounds like his past actions have long-term consequences. NTA. You just told the truth. Maybe if he wasn't abusive, the truth would've been more in his favor. You potentially saved a kid from a bad situation.", "Nta.  You can't be the ahole in this situation for telling the truth.  Also, you did the kid(s) a favor by inadvertently helping get them denied and hopefully they find a loving family bc clearly that's not with ex", "NTA but I need clarification. So you feel like he is dangerous and abusive enough to harm a child but you still send your kids over there? Make it make sense. And no, your hunch that he isn\u2019t interested is not a good excuse.", "NTA. Were you supposed to lie, so your abuser could have a new victim? Watch out for yourself and your kids going forward, though. Be sure they know to tell you if your ex becomes abusive towards them (especially the 11 year-old, who could be more vulnerable).", "NTA", "NTA but as a child who got interviewed by child services,I absolutley despise that they dared to interview your children without asking your first. And probably against their will. \nI do remember the horrible feeling and the inapropriate questions and the uncomfortable feeling when dealing with them or similar situations in which I am feeling juged never went away. Did th\u00e9 children have a choice? I wished I wouldn\u2019t have been manipulated and forced into this talks.", "It happened when I was barely dragging myself out of bed. I just wanted it to be over with and he didn't even want to see the children. I was the one who pushed him to see them in the first place because they were getting distressed asking where he was. So after begging him to just come and see them once we went out for lunch and then we did it again a couple weeks later. And it became a habit. And yeah.", "My issue is that she still sends her kids over to see him overnight but is so concerned over him having more kids. Something isn\u2019t adding up.", "She is still sending her kids over to his house after all she says happened. I am so confused about her intentions.", "They said they had a choice and their dad warned them what was happening first. I was annoyed that I was left out of the loop but they said they didn't care", "I'm now worried for you OP. What if out of revenge your ex and his wife start alienating your children from you? You said your ex already spoils them. Won't take much to buy their affections and turn them against you. What if his wife forces your kids to call her mom instead? Do you kids understand the situation?", ">I was the one who pushed him to see them in the first place because they were getting distressed asking where he was.\n\nSo instead of explaining in age-appropriate terms that their dad was abusive and needed help so you were staying away, you just....sent them to stay with an abuser? He's too dangerous to take in a foster child, but supervising your OWN children is ok? You feel like you're \"safe\" now because he's \"fixated\" on something else???\n\nHoly hell this is horrifying. I really hope there's something I'm missing here.", "She already said in her post, he doesn\u2019t care to hurt them anymore. I believe that when she was with him, he only hurt the kids to get back at her for whatever reason. Basically \u201cI\u2019ll kill them if you leave me.\u201d Type thing. If the kids are comfortable going then why stop them?", "I don't understand why you're angry that my children aren't being abused", "I\u2019m sorry but there is no excuse sending children back into a potentially dangerous situation just because they get toys and treats.", "They\u2019ll be alright. The court would\u2019ve made her do it anyway, and if she kept them from him then it would be a whole other situation where the kids hate mom for never letting them see daddy.", "Yeah no. The court would have withdrawn and removed all custody from the father if they knew what he had done previously. Clearly and concisely speaking to a child about a situation can do wonders.", "False! It would\u2019ve been her word against his, their word against his. When you\u2019re rich, you can do anything. They wanna see their dad because he\u2019s finally treating them *somewhat* okay then let it happen. If he went to court over it the court would give him exactly what he has now."]}
