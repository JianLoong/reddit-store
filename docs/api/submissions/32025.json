You'll be cleaning the space every time while you stay there anyway.      \n  \nI feel like you are there not only to learn the technical details of farming but also how much fucking work it is every day. If somebody is complaining about cleaning their own living space, I doubt they'd make it through the stay.      \n  \nI'm not claiming I am 100% right or anything, it's just how I feel. I certainly would not have taken offence and would have gladly helped.", "I'd bet they haven't been paying the high school kids who've been helping out until now either.", "They\u2019re definitely lying about not being able to afford to pay their intern", "These financially irresponsible boomers. I\u2019ll tell ya what. Maybe if they stopped buying all those lattes and avocados toast and fourth houses, they could afford to pay for labor.", "[deleted]", "OP just knows better than all of us. That\u2019s why she asked us!", "exactly, i\u2019ve heard of things like that and i\u2019m all for it! but OP seems to be making it out like something it isn\u2019t. at the very least, they\u2019ve been misleading about the living conditions and labor required up until the \u201cintern\u201d arrived, which is not okay.", "It\u2019s not free labor though. He\u2019s already paying the person for the marketing. She\u2019s literally there to learn about farm life. She has no other reason to live there than not. She is essentially interning as a farmhand.\n\nNot all the work you do on a farm is directly related to livestock or agriculture. A lot of it is just done to keep the farm running. That includes cleaning the property.", "Then it\u2019s not a fucking internship. They aren\u2019t interns.", "Oh, I'm sure they gave the kids a glass of lemonade and a cookie.\n\nThey're high-school kids, they don't need money as much as the 60 year old couple who needs a third guest house", "My school has a farm. The students can take a class to help with the farm. \n\nI've not seen a farm take an intern who already works for the farm, without paying them, and without any school coursework. \n\nInterns should be paid for work they do anyway. That's how every other aspect of training at a job works. You don't get a job and go to work for the first 9 weeks without pay in order to learn your job. You might be paid less, say minim wage, until trained by you aren't stiffed pay while you get trained. Even apprentices in the old days are paid a small stipend and room and board.", "Agree completely.\n\nBizarre to think it is acceptable that someone should arrive to a dirty place without blinds.", ">She is essentially interning as a farmhand. \n\nIf she\u2019s in the US and she\u2019s not being paid, she\u2019s being used as illegal slave labor.", "[deleted]", "I agree that unpaid interns should not be a thing, but they are so I hesitate to make it the reason somebody is \"the asshole.\"", "I don\u2019t care who uses it that a lie. What is this \u201cconnection\u201d and why are you and the poster a couple days old here? Coincidence?", "So, to take it farther to price a point,  slave owners aren't assholes, because other people also owned slaves? \n\nOne can be doing things legally and in ways others do then and still be an ass hole.", "[deleted]", "That's not comparable, one is voluntary and one is not. Is this woman a refugee with nowhere else to go? Or is she simply a community member who wants to learn farming?", "[deleted]"]}
