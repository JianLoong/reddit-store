On Mondays, which is the day my car is in the shop, he usually gets off work between noon and 2 and I don't get off until 5. When I asked if he could pick me up, he said \"I was hoping to have alone time, can you just have your co-worker take you to pick it up?\" I got upset because I feel like he was already going to have a few hours of alone time. I told him I thought he was being selfish and I feel like I dont want to be in a relationship with someone I feel like I cant depend on. I also said I wanted alone time now and that we could do our own thing for dinner and the entire evening then. \n*Of note, he has said many times over the course of our relationship l'm too independent and I should ask him to help me with more things but this isn't the first time I've asked for \"help\" and felt let down. I also feel like when you have a partner these are the types of things they should help with if possible, not co-workers/friends. He doesn't feel he is wrong and said I'm wrong for getting mad, starting an argument and not wanting to have dinner and spend the evening together. The alone time isnt an issue for me, I'm more than willing to give that to him but he was going to have alone time prior and I was willing to give him the whole evening if he wanted. Which one of us is the asshole in this situation?\n**I also didn't shout at him. I was upset but it seems like people think I flew off the handle which I didn't. I expressed myself in an angry tone but wasn't yelling.\n\n***this was not a last minute schedule.

When you're in a relationship, this is the kind of thing you depend upon each other for, NOT co-workers, paying extra for Uber etc..  I could see if he was working, had other obligations, but he was not busy. Co-workers/friends are there to help if your partner is not available which you already used once.  That is something typically that can work around real life schedules.  Most couples even schedule things for when their partner is not working to make it easier. He was technically available.  I don't understand not being able to because of needing more than he already had \"alone time\".    Heck, alone time would be in the car ride to go pick you up even.\n\nIf this  how he feels, I think he should get alot more \"alone\" time by himself and not have a partner.   Sounds like this is not the first time something like this has happened and something to either work out or decide if you want to put up with it.\n\nSigned - an introvert that needs alone time but still supports their partner and even friends when they need a ride or favor.", "It's sad when a coworker will do more for you than your own bf \n\nIf no is allowed and you start saying no to helping him, how long before he gets upset?\n\nHaving a partner means that they will step up if you need help.\n\nNta \n\nTime to have a talk and reevaluate the relationship.", "NTA\n\nAlone time is one thing. Helping your partner is another.\n\nGet someone who appreciates you", "NTA\n\nI find it interesting he says you are wrong for getting mad but is upset that you no longer wanted to spend the evening together because you wanted to be alone.....\n\nPart of being in a relationship is helping out your partner. Compromising plus doing something you rather not do goes along way and fosters support.     \n\n\nHe can say no and that's it. No means no, however you are fully within your right to be upset and wish to reevaluate the relationship you are in. Him throwing it in your face was unnecessary and escalated the situation further.", "NTA\nAre the standards for a partner really so low that asking your love in partner to pick you up from work one time when your car is on the shop - which he knew of well in advance - is considered too much? Wow. That\u2019s kind of a baseline minimum to me. I go out of the way for my partner all the time and he does the same for me because we are, you know, partners.", "NTA. It's called life and if he kicks up such a fuss for helping you get your car, imagine what he would be like when it's more important. I would be left feeling like I was with someone I couldn't depend on.", "NTA because being partners in life means being there for each other even when you \"want alone time\". It sounds like he gets this alone time every Monday before you get home from work at 5 pm and you weren't asking him to interrupt his 3 hours of alone time between 2-5 pm, you were asking him to do it after you got off work at 5 pm.\n\nHe doesn't want to be inconvenienced, but he is fine with you inconveniencing your friends.\n\nPeople that are in relationships but don't want to go out of their way to help their partner aren't worth investing your life in. What happens when you end up in the hospital and visiting you interrupts his \"alone time\"?", "NTA. the yta votes are cracking me up. You asked your long-term partner for a very simple favor. Yes, it\u2019s a minor inconvenience for him, but in a long-term relationship where you\u2019re meant to be a team and help/support one another, it\u2019s kind of expected that your partner be willing to minorly inconvenience themselves when you really need their help. I feel like this request is on par with expecting your partner to pick you up from the airport instead of making you take a cab, if they\u2019re available. If you can\u2019t expect your partner to ever inconvenience themselves in the slightest to help you out when you really need it, then you\u2019re not actually partners. \n\nEveryone has a right to not want to do something that inconveniences them, and I\u2019m not saying you need to bend over backwards for your partners every request, but if he\u2019s not even willing to help you grab your car from the shop instead of you having to pay money to take a cab, then what kind of \u201cpartner\u201d is he really? It\u2019s not even like helping you would be some massive inconvenience or undertaking for him, or interfere with his work schedule, he just doesn\u2019t want to have to get off the couch to help you out after work. \n\nIf his private relaxation time takes precedence over helping you with a simple favor that he\u2019s fully available to help you with, what else is he going to refuse to help you with? If you can\u2019t ask your partner for help when they\u2019re fully available to help you, what can you reasonably expect out of them? \n\nHe\u2019s telling you that his after work relaxation time is more important to him than helping you. He\u2019d rather you inconvenience a coworker than rely on your own boyfriend for help. And let me stress again, the favor you are asking of him is in no way interfering with his work or other important plans, you\u2019re requesting maybe 30 minutes of his free time to help you get your car. The fact that this is too big of a favor to ask of him is pretty concerning.", "NTA it's a reasonable request for a couple and a small ask, to compromise and help when needed. My boyfriend and I will do it for each other all the time, to the train station, to service the cars, to even just pick up some shopping if we need to, we do it for each other because we care and would rather help each other than not.\n\nTo the people that say he's entitled to say no, yes he is but he shouldn't expect help when he needs it. I think the issue is more than your bf just not picking you up but overall OP puts more effort in the relationship and the effort is one sided and unappreciated", "You pretty much said it yourself at the end. There's no reason for him to not come get you. That is what partners are for. He's supposed to be the one person you can always depend on and he let you down. NTA", "NTA -  My husband and I always give each other a ride for car service.   It's not a big deal and it's what partners do.", "NTA, I agree that your request was a perfectly reasonable expectation of a live in partner. I\u2019d seriously consider where you fall on his list of priorities and how that looks for the future.", "NTA - But you really need to reevaluate your relationship!  That your live-in BF would not do something so simple for you, is a major red flag.", "NTA, picking a car up from the mechanic is a chore, just like the dishes or laundry. Alone time has to take second seat next to responsibilities. I've never told my person that I wanted alone time so I wouldn't be helping out and that they'd have to figure it out. \n\nBut also you suggesting alone time for the rest of the evening seems retaliatory so maybe spend some time conditioning your responses to upsetting information in the future.", "NTA though I think you should give him his alone time...permanently.  He doesn't appear to be mature enough nor interested in having a partnership with you.  He seems to move the goalposts a lot and only when it suits him.  You can do better.", "NTA. I love my alone time, in fact it\u2019s detrimental to my mental health. But picking you up at the time you usually leave work doesn\u2019t cut much into that time honestly, unless you have a long commute. And if it cut into his alone time more than he was comfortable with, the reasonable thing to do is request that he gets that alone time either after he drops you at the shop, or later that week.", "NTA.  This lack of help could be an indication of things to come.  He seems pretty selfish.", "My ex did this to me, multiple times. The final straw for me is when I called stranded and his response was can't you call a friend? I was done after that. It's called respect and he is showing you exactly how much respect he has for you. Believe him and be done.", "Sure you can ask and he can say no but what\u2019s the use of being in a relationship if you can\u2019t even feel like going to the said when you need help. NTA", "I'm surprised at all the \"YTAs\" here, I think NTA and am surprised no one has pointed out how OP's bf contradicted himself (wants alone time then gets upset when OP said she wanted alone time after the argument). I likely say NTA cuz my husband is the type to always help me and would be offended if I asked someone else for help before asking him. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What the heck? Alone time? NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine my BF saying something like this. It just screams laziness. Can\u2019t he have his \u201calone time\u201d another time, for example, when you don\u2019t need a ride?", "\\*Of note, he has said many times over the course of our relationship l'm too independent and I should ask him to help me with more things but this isn't the first time I've asked for \"help\" and felt let down. I also feel like when you have a partner these are the types of things they should help with if possible, not co-workers/friends. \n\nSoooooooo thats what you want for the rest of your life? NTA but maybe rethink jumping down someone's throat as the first reaction you know for your next bf.", "Lol he's in a relationship with you and thinks the random coworker should pick you up instead?", "NTA. His need for alone time is important, but I would never leave my partner hanging like this. The next time he says you\u2019re \u201ctoo independent,\u201d remind him that you have to be, since you cannot count on him to help when you need it.", "If I was your bo I would have changed the breaks for you.  Saving you the labor charge and you could have made me a nice Pot Roast or something.", " Oh I would give him alone time all right lots of it .", "ESH. Him because of the obvious, it doesn\u2019t take that much time to help you and drive you there. He should be willing to help you. You because clearly when you jumped straight to \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with someone who is selfish\u201d. That means this isn\u2019t a one time thing or even an occasional thing. Clearly he isn\u2019t changing and clearly you are getting tired of feeling like you\u2019re in a one sided relationship. So either have a real talk about what you expect/what you need or go your separate ways", "NTA. I\u2019m angry for you: helping your beloved is a privilege, a gift, an indication they cherish you. \n\nHe\u2019d soon have all the alone time he wants, if he were mine.", "NTA. Other people seem to think your reaction was disproportionate, and I would probably agree if it was just this one isolated incident, but it sounds like it might be part of an ongoing issue and this is just where it came to a head. I would focus on resolving the bigger issue instead of dwelling on this one instance.", "NTA find a better boyfriend.", "YTA you asked and he replied quite politely. You shouldn't jump straight to anger after someone says no to you. Maybe next time plan ahead and discuss with him bout when he can help you. Dont just demand it. Which btw a request without the option to say no is a demand.", "*He doesn't feel he is wrong and said I'm wrong for getting mad, starting an argument and not wanting to have dinner and spend the evening together.* \n\nHe wants his alone time and tells you NO. He has all right to say NO. That doesn't make him TA for saying NO. The thing is when you told him that you want alone time as well (not having dinner and to spend the weekend alone), then it's an issue. Some say you escalated the situation when he is doing the same exact thing in response to your response.", "NTA- this is a very reasonable request. He has at least 3 hours of alone time before you get off work. How much does he need?", "YTA - he responded to your question, and you unnecessarily escalated the situation. Maybe he really did need some alone time or maybe he could have picked you up. Starting a fight doesnt help though.", "There are many couples with really serious problems that lead to a relationship dispute. You choose such a thing? For that alone YTA.\n\nGet your car.

Get angry at your bf.\n\n\nYTA", " Having time to yourself in a relationship is healthy, normal, and reasonable. But so to is managing that 'alone time' around the needs and expectations of your partner. It wasn't a big ask and \"I need alone time\" is incredibly easy to \"reschedule\".

At first I was thinking N T A but now leaning ESH.", "YTA.  You're an AH because you made plans to take your car to the shop while expecting him to pick you up. You may have asked him, but you had already committed to taking your car to the shop, so asking him was really more of an after-the-fact than genuinely asking him.  When he said he'd rather do something else, you blew up at him turning the entire situation into an argument that didn't need to happen if you would have just had an adult conversation with him.", "ESH but I can see where you're coming from I wouldn't be with a man who wasn't able to be depended on in these situations you guys are suppose to be able to do these things and depend on each other", "YTA - he's allowed to say no to you. Your feelings of being sad are valid, but that's kind of your own issue that you need to work through. He's not responsible for your feelings.", "ESH. He is in fact being a bit lazy/selfish for not wanting to take an hour tops out of his day to pick you up and drop you off to get your car, **BUT** you blew it out of proportion by implying you didn't want the relationship anymore and saying you wont spend any time with him at all that night just because you were annoyed at him over that. kind of seems like you need to have a bigger talk about what both of you have for expectation in terms of like support because it seems like neither of you are really clear on what you want.", "YTA\n\nYou can ask. He doesn\u2019t have to agree", "YTA. He\u2019s entitled to his alone time. You weaponized his desire for alone time by trying to flip it in his face last minute. It\u2019s petty. Take an Uber or ask the friend.", "ESH. As a live-in partner, I assume that you two are serious about your relationship, and that it is more than transactional. \n\nHe should have agreed to pick you up.\n\nYou should not have escalated when he declined.\n\nIt seems like this is a \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 sort of situation, and may be revealing a much bigger underlying conflict.", "ESH. I need alone time too as an introvert but I reschedule it as necessary to adapt to the ever changing circumstances called life. You could have easily said \"I understand its important to you,  lets plan a block of time where I can leave you alone so you can recharge.\"\n\nThe problem with blocking out alone time  is that you start to relax and then someone interupts or needs something and your social battery immediately resets to zero. So if he's counting on a specified number of hours to recharge and you shortcut that, he might as well not bother at all.", "YTA... sounds like having your coworker drop you off is easier. You sound controlling and dramatic.", "ESH I\u2019m going a bit against the grain here. I pick my husband up if he needs me and he does the same for me (we always have, when we were dating too). So from my perspective giving he\u2019d just have to pick you up and then he could have his alone time was reasonable. On the other hand jumping straight to calling him selfish was not. If my partner called me selfish immediately after I said no to something, no way in hell I\u2019d be doing it then.

You are wrong for getting mad and just because you feel let down doesn\u2019t mean he let you down. You asked he said no and then you threw a fit over it. You then behaved punitively just to get back at him.", "Info: he asked if you could find somebody else because he wanted alone time, was that a refusal to help or honestly just asking? I would say Y T A if you escalated this into punishing him without just saying, \"No, I don't want to do that, and I'm hurt that you'd prefer that.\"", "YTA for wanting to break up over partner wanting a little bit of down time.  Ask your coworker, get an Uber, whatever it takes.", "If your response to asking for a favor and being told \"no\" is to get angry, then you came into it with a shitty attitude and an expectation, the act of \"asking\" was dishonest, you were dressing up \"telling\" so as not to sound so demanding... but... like.... you're still being demanding, you still had the expectation, you \"asked\" your partner without giving them any real option to say \"no\", so you kind of default to YTA just for that.  \n\n\nIt's reasonable to think your partner should help you out.  It's unreasonable to act like he can't say no or it's rude to do so.  You're an adult and this isn't an emergency, figure it out.", "Bruh OP you asked he answered and your first thought because he denied is to guilt trip him into accepting by saying that you want your alone time to re-evaluate if you want to be with him.

Yeah, sounds to me like you'd be better off without him just for that alone (haha get it), but him refusing to help you with a **PLANNED** pickup really ices the cake for me.", "Reddit seems to think that no one should be inconvenienced ever. Perhaps getting angry wasn't the best way to handle it, but what is the point of having a partner if you aren't going to help each other out?  It's not like you were asking for this every day, it was a one off thing. NTA", "That\u2019s totally valid, I\u2019m surprised by how many people are saying Y T A. Like you said he had time between him getting off work and picking you up, and if he really needed more alone time then he could have requested to be alone afterwards. Making time for yourself in a relationship does not mean neglecting your partner!", "Exactly.  Please ignore the Y T A\u2019s.  The only way you\u2019d be the AH is if this was a boyfriend of a few months that you didn\u2019t live with.\n\nHe\u2019s not acting like an actual partner.", "Time for a \u201cboy bye\u201d. You can and will do so much better with someone else", "Yes!!!! 100%", "Right! Sure, sometimes you just want to laze around but if my partner needed me and I have the time to help. Why not. Her request wasn\u2019t unreasonable either. To have to go ask someone when you have a partner who can help, that said something. Imagine he said no to one things and she said no to another things. It\u2019s gonna build up and it\u2019s not healthy.", "I did not get the impression OP's partner gave her any notice he wanted alone time on Monday. At least not prior to her asking if he could pick her up.   \n\n\nAnother thing is how her request is more then reasonable. It does not disrespect him in any way by asking. Him saying No is within his right but definitely leaves OP questioning how supportive he is.", "This was scheduled a week ago and we had talked about it many times leading up to it. I realized I didn't mention that part in my question.", "No.  NTA, he tells you you're too independent but says no when you ask for help.  Not the first time either!  Reliability is in the top 3 requirements for me.", "There are so many posts on reddit where the OP wasn't there for his wife when she needed it most (like the guy who went to Vegas with his buddies shortly after she lost the baby). I always wonder if she wasn't paying attention to signs before they were married. Well, OP, this is one of the early signs that he will not be there for you when you need it because he has better things to do.", "It sounds like he gets 3-5 hours regularly.  This was a one off instance where his partner asked for help.", "But he gets alone time weekly and will still get an hour. While alone time is necessary, there are times when needs come up that take precedent. He could always ask for alone time in the evening and she could make plans to go out or something.", "It is sometimes. But like op said he'll already have a few hours of it, and I get that might not be as much as he hoped for, but relationships are all about compromise. His gf needs to get home and he is able to get her. Why should they burden op's coworker with a responsibility that he should be taking on?", "OP, that IS what partners do when you're in a relationship. Take it from an \"oldy-wed\" who has been married over 25 years. These are the things a marriage is made from. \n\nYou're not wrong, I think you know what you need to do.... \n\nPLEASE update us in a few weeks!", "Aaaaand I'm getting downvoted, but idgaf.", "Thx, back at ya, agree 100%", "I made my comment before her edit. Even with the edit there's missing info. Lile if your talking for 5 days and unable to settle on plans for something so small it really speaks to their ability to communicate with one another. Also feel like there's a big difference between her asking him to help her that day n him being like I planned on having some alone time is there another option and her getting instant upset. To her being like you didn't help me earlier so now I'm gonna cancel on our already made plans and use the same reason you did earlier just to be petty. If she generally did want to b alone just coz she wanted to b alone then he absolutely needs to respect that. But its reasonable to get upset over cancelled plans for petty reasons.", "3 hours of alone time daily* you mean.", "Its not just an interesting take, its the truth! If your sooooo independent, then maybe you would consider a ride share service instead of feeling like you are entitled to someones free time.", "It\u2019s not an interesting take you\u2019re a whole ass person you can get yourself to the dealership or mechanic to get your car. Your partner is supposed to be there but not be your everything.", "And it was for a drop off to pick up her car. From which he could then have his \u201calone time\u201d. It\u2019s not like she was trying to make plans for after getting the car", "Maybe he\u2019s planning an activity that takes uninterrupted time? Did she **need** to take the car in that day, or was it something that could be scheduled? Unless your brakes are failing, you can usually schedule it. Is this a trend? Do his days alone usually end up being interrupted? \n\nIt sounds like she escalated", "Yeah this is Reddit, and anything that involved inconveniencing someone else is always downvoted. Sometimes, I wonder how old these people are that are thinking that it is unreasonable for partners to ask each other for help", "You are right, I was being petty. I do want to be alone because I'm upset and angry but I said it also to be petty and make a point. You are also correct that the communication was bad. I kind of assumed he would do it since I asked in advance and he didn't say no or that he had plans. But I didn't outright ask him until this morning. In my mind, I have an expectation of partnership and when that wasn't met, as it hasn't been in the past, I was triggered and responded poorly. I think what I'm realizing is, there are much bigger issues going on here with a lot of underlying issues besides the above question.", "Did you miss the part where OP says her BF tells her she\u2019s TOO independent and wants her to rely on him more? And when she does try to rely on him he says \u201cno\u201d. So really can OP really rely on him at all?", "I agree he shouldn't be everything, and he isn't. I live a whole ass life outside of him. But should he be anything? Or should there be no expectations in a relationship?", "I have a hard time understanding OP's partner ... \"Have your coworker take you.\" Why are you in a relationship if you can't be there for a simple favor. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, everyone needs time to themselves. However he is home after 2 and she needs help after 5. I get that it may be cut short potentially. Fine you only had 2 hours ish to be alone. It is not as if OP was planning a event after, that would consume his night. He could very easily gone back to being alone.   \n\nIn my eyes it is such a simple ask.", "She says in the OP that her brakes needed to be replaced. Usually means the vehicle needs more urgent repair.", "Right? Good point", "Tbh I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being petty. It\u2019s okay to want to be alone if you\u2019re feeling upset, it can help you feel better. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unfair assumption to make but now you know to work on communication. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get there, you are a team in a relationship after all :) good luck OP <3", "If your needs in the relationship arnt being met as a whole that definitely sucks and can understand being upset and frustrated by that. Do think having a sit down discussion about expectations for both sides would be a good idea. Dont think this particular situation is too bad and jst some pent up emotions peeping out. Long as you guys are able to open up your communication then it should be easily fixable. Hope it all works out for you. Needing some time to decompress when your upset is fine but u do need to b able to communicate that point like if you had just said something like \" im feeling rather upset right now as iv been asking for help for few days now and I haven't been able to get anything concrete out of you. its left me feeling like I can't rely on u n rn I need to process my emotions so I can come back to u and talk about this without it coming from a place of hurt\"", "You asked and he said no. Then you called him selfish for his reasonable response. It\u2019s not his job to cater to you and if you\u2019re so insecure that a simple \u201cno I was planning on my alone time\u201d is enough to make you question your relationship you shouldn\u2019t be in one. His love and care shouldn\u2019t be decided by transactions and whether or not he schlep you around. If you need a ride you have other options. This wasn\u2019t a need but a desire and he\u2019s well within his grounds to say no to something that\u2019s not a need of yours.", "I mean is it really cut short? Wouldn't op be home if they had their car anyway? So either way his alone time is over. Unless they hang out in different rooms??? Which makes no sense to me but that might just be me.", "Not necessarily. You can know your brakes are ready to be replaced months in advance. You could also blow a brake line and need repair asap. Modern cars have redundant braking systems, so it\u2019s often not an urgent job.", "You are absolutely right. I need to work on that.", "I kinda figured if she had her car and arrived home, he would be in another room and maybe greeted her if she came in to say hi. \n\nI get it, you look forward to whatever he would be doing during those hours. But it does sound like every day he is done at 2 and she is done at 5. Giving him a few hours alone per day without kids etc that would consume his time. Maybe there is more to his schedule, who knows. I just find why be in a relationship if you are not going to support your partner in times of need. And I would definitely say helping them get their car back is a time of need on the pure level of convenience alone.", "Well you\u2019d be an idiot to let your brakes get worse when you know they need to be replaced??
