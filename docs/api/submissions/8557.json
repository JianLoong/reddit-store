If in fact you now realize you didn\u2019t think the rule through as much as you could have, you may want to talk to your other children and consider explaining that and apologize for making (yes, your wife was there, but at this point you are solo and should take responsibility for **your** choices, regardless of her\u2019s) such a life-impacting house rule without giving it enough critical thought at the time. \n\n- If your views have just changed over time, was that something you realized was happening and didn\u2019t communicate to anyone else in the family, or did you only realize it when you came face to face with the potential consequences (catching the daughter and not wanting to have to kick her out)? If you knew and didn\u2019t communicate, you may want to consider acknowledging that that wasn\u2019t in the spirit of good communication and a loving familial relationship. If you didn\u2019t realize until you had to face a consequence, consider that again this may look to others like you made rules that impacted their lives without thinking them through, and only thought them through when it impacted *you*.\n\nFor the record, I agree with your choice as you faced it recently to stand by your daughter.
