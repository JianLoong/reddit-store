We had a rule, we\u2019ve had it with all of our children, it was a rule that my wife put in place when we first had children and we\u2019ve applied it to all of them with no exceptions. \n\nThe rule is: No sex until you move out of our home and are no longer living with us. my wife\u2019s reasoning was a faith based no sex before marriage (and its unlikely to be married and still living with us) and because it meant no real risk of pregnancy or a child being in our home, we\u2019ve already raised babies, we don\u2019t feel like raising another which would inevitably happen if any of our children had a child while living with us. \n\none of our daughters is a lesbian and thought this rule didn\u2019t apply to her. i\u2019ve caught her and her gf twice and just ignored it because theres no point in shaming or being mad when theres no risk of pregnancy and i don\u2019t believe in the no sex before marriage any longer. I just want her to be safe and she is being safe, we had a conversation about sex and consent and i\u2019ve met her girlfriend, As far as I\u2019m concerned i\u2019ve done my job at making sure our kids have been safe (whereas my wife never bothered and never liked acknowledging sex even exists to the kids)\n\nWhen my ex wife found out, she wasn\u2019t calm about it.. a big fight happened which i walked into after work, i had to choose my daughter or my marriage. my ex wife thought i betrayed her, that i am no longer trustworthy or loyal and that i could kick our daughter out for not following the rule, or that we can get a divorce because she can\u2019t love a faithless liar. if i kicked my daughter out she would of moved in with her gf\u2019s family and would rightfully never forgive me, and if i don\u2019t i lose my wife. i knew what i was choosing, divorce. now all of the other children are mad at me for the divorce and my ex wife has turned my own family (siblings, cousins, extended family etc) against me. she gave me a choice and i chose.", "created_utc": 1674951846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nu2ku/aita_for_choosing_my_daughter_over_my_wifes_faith/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does your wife realise that the 'no sex before you move out of home' is pretty much unenforceable? \n\nHow would you every know that your kids haven't had sex? Does she also realise it's 2023, not 1723?\n\nHer reasons for not wanting sex before marriage doesn't hold water? There is nothing that says a child having sex before marriage is going to \n\na) result in pregnancy\n\nb) mean that the child wants you to bring any future child in your home (many many couples have children outside of marriage without the grandparents involvement) \n\nNot having any conversation about sex is more likely to result in an unplanned pregnancy that having an open conversation about sex, contraception and consent!\n\nIt sounds like you've had a lucky escape from a religious zealot. You did right by sticking up for your daughter. Please have the same consideration for any of your other children that may not be in same sex relationships!", "NTA, good for protecting the kid", "Your forced choice was your kid or your (ex) wife\u2019s faith, you are totally NTA for choosing your daughter.\n\nI\u2019d opt to support a living person than a faith/belief any given day", "NTA, you chose your child over a fairy tale.\n\nedit: she's super into \"faith\" but got a divorce at the drop of a hat because you wouldn't kick your kid out of the house?", "NTA for choosing not to kick your daughter out BUT \n\nif the rule is no sex, then that should apply for ALL children, regardless of sexual orientation. Your wife doesn't believe in pre-marital sex, and it seems like you were only concerned with having a grandchild so you let it slide. You two apparently didn't have the same understanding on why the rule was in place. \n\nThe ONLY reason this is NTA and NAH (bc honestly your wife isn't wrong for wanting her rules followed) is SOLELY because she was going to kick her out.", "The right thing to do is rarely the easy one. NTA.", "NTA \n\nKids have sex. It\u2019s what they do! Educate them to make smart choices. Don\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nAlso, saying that lesbian sex is fine because it can\u2019t result in pregnancy while true, does this include your other kids who can use contraception to avoid pregnancy or will you just allow the girls to have sex as no babies can be made?\n\nI\u2019m hoping the same rule applies to all your kids!?", "NTA you chose wisely. If she wasn't prepared to support your daughter then there was really no choice. Sorry but also good for you.", "NTA. Your wife sounds crazy, and/or there are a lot more things that were already wrong with your marriage if this one thing was enough for her to tell you to make that choice. I also can't imagine why your own family would let your ex-wife turn them against you. Seems like there's more to the back story.\n\nIt's also ridiculous for parents to make a rule like that. Do they really think it stops their kids from having sex if they want to have sex? It absolutely does not. All it does is drive a secrecy wedge between parents and kids, which can lead to major issues down the road if a kid does get pregnant outside of marriage (or impregnates someone else).", "NTA, your wife made the ultimatum, not you. The punishment is very drastic and frankly unacceptable in this day and age. This does not however mean, that she shouldn't have been reprimanded in some way or form, since it was a rule and your other kids also had to abide to it. It just isn't fair to treat her differently.\n\nBut since things turned out the way they did, good on you OP, your daughter will 100% remember what you did for her for the rest of her life.", "I'm calling BS on this one.

Any parent who would kick out a literal child over their sexuality is an as*hole. Get that divorce ASAP.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing the right thing by not throwing your kid out. Even if your daughter was straight and there was a chance of pregnancy, you\u2019d be doing right by supporting her and not kicking her out.\n\nYour ex is an AH, not for her religion, but for only applying some of it for her convenience (\u201cI don\u2019t want to raise any grandkids\u201d) and ignoring the rest of it (like love, compassion, charity, etc).", "NTA.  Nobody buys a Range Rover without a few test drives first.  She ask you to choose her faith over your kid.  She gave you an ultimatum and you made the right choice.

You ensured you did your duty as a father and protected your daughter. Your family may be mad, but hopefully, your other children will see what you did for their sibling. I'm sure a day will come when they will appreciate having a father like you. For now, I wouldn't try and argue with your wife or other family members. Just tell them the truth when asked, and I am sure your wife will eventually tell on herself with whatever lies she may come up with.", "NTA, I've never understood people who blindly believe no teenager is gonna have sex. If you think your teenager doesn't have sex its because they've learned to be extremely sneaky due to your strict rules. It's unrealistic. You protected your daughter and your wife chose to give you to extremely dramatic and needless choices for an ultimatum. Religious people can be scary. Good look bro I hope you can mend your relationship with your remaining kids and they get out.", "I'm gonna say ESH. Religion aside, you did agree to a certain parenting rule and then made a unilateral exception for one child. So that's a bit of an AH move. Sounds like for the best you got a divorce though and ex definitely being an AH.", "I might have discussed it with my daughter first. That way I'd know from her own mouth how she'd feel either way. \n\nThe issue isn't your daughter. The issue isn't your choice to support your daughter. The issue is the two married parents who couldn't discuss serious topics\u2014even if it's emotionally explosive at first\u2014and come to a shared decision. \n\nIn my faith, the only legitimate reason to divorce with the hope to marry someone new is if one mate is unfaithful. And even I agree this situation is utterly stupid. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nSounds as if the rule was to prevent unwed pregnancies.  No chance of that happening with your daughter's relationship.\n\nBesides, at some point, your kids become adults.  You have to believe you instilled in them your values and some common sense.  You have to let them go and lead their own life, mistakes, successes, and all.", "I'm going against the grain but YTA. You made a rule for all of your kids.

The two of you could have had a private discussion, fight, whatever, before bringing it to your daughter.\n\nYou did hide this from her. It has nothing to do with what you hid or your daughter's sexuality. You lied to your wife of decades.\n\nYou are focusing on the final moments of your marriage and not the build up to those moments.\n\nYou two could have ended up in the same place after discussing it, but you wouldn't have broken her trust.\n\nThis isn't a gay thing, or a religion thing, it's a trust thing. YTA", "To bad she was so hard headed. Yes you broke her rule, but you looked at it a different way. This marriage would ended anyway. NTA", "ESH you and your ex wife. Yes rules should have applied to all children regardless. That's why I think you're the AH. Your wifes rule and yalls reasoning are also ridiculous. Goodness for your kids.", "NTA.
