Other than saying hello to him occasionally I've never had a full conversation with him so I try not to have an opinion.\n\nI opened the present with my mum and she sort of giggled a little bit when I opened it, I was about to leave for the day so I left it on the stairs so I could take it up to my room when I got back in the evening. When I got back I had an empty bottle so I  I got to the house I went straight to the bin and I see my shirt inside, I take the shirt out to discover it's been torn in half. Mum and Toby were eating their dinner in the same room so I asked them what happened to it, mum told me that while I was away they were planning on calling my uncle and thanking him for the gifts he got them, she said she was worried he would bring up the shirt he got me and she didn't want Toby to be caught off guard so she went to get the shirt to show him. She said that Toby got offended by the \"let's sacrifice Toby\" and someone welding a knife as Toby has been threatened with a knife before and apparently it is triggering for him. She then started to lecture me saying that it was a mean present so I interrupted her to point out that my uncle bought it I merely received the gift. She repeated that Toby didn't find it very funny and went back to eating her dinner.\nI completely understand why Toby feels upset it's his reaction that is making me write this.\n\nI've spoken to my uncle and he's apologised for causing an incident.\n\nEarlier today I was talking to my mum and asked her again what happened, mainly repeated what she had already said but she clarified that Toby put the shirt on the ground, stood on it with one foot and tore it in half (I initially assumed he cut it with scissors)\n\nI asked why show it to Toby when she knew it would offend him but she  said knives aren't funny and she's scared to go into work as she has to travel to a nearby city where there has been several stabbings, she then again started to lecture me saying that if she knew the shirt had a knife on it she never would agreed to it. I questioned her on this as she has already admitted that she'd seen a picture of the shirt and she told me that the picture that she saw had glare covering the knife. I asked her to send me the picture and she shortly after.\n\nShe didn't send me the picture so I asked my uncle and most of the knife is obscured but it still says \"let's sacrifice Toby\" so I don't  know why she thought it would be ok.\n\nI know I'm definitely NTA in this situation but I'm trying to figure out who is? My uncle for buying the gift, my mum for agreeing to it and showing it to Toby or Toby for being justifiably upset but reacting poorly?\n\nShortened to fit post limit", "created_utc": 1704412117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yrxqj/aita_my_27m_mums_boyfriend_55m_tore_up_my/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your uncle gave you a joke gift he knew you'd appreciate (he didn't know you would be opening it in front of Toby). \n\nSounds to me like your mother thought it was funny until she realized how upset Toby was and then tried to back-track. She didn't need to show him the shirt again to laugh. Toby shouldn't have destroyed your property. I don't care how \"triggered\" or not he felt.", "NTA. Fuck Toby sounds like an ass", "NTA\n\n  \nTell your mom she and Toby will have to replace it, and you will visit next time when she has replaced the gift they destroyed.\n\n  \nTHEY are the AHs for destroying your gift.", "NTA. I hate Toby. Lol", "Your mum\u2019s a bit odd. Maybe she\u2019s a people pleaser? Going along with the uncle then doing a total 180 to please Toby. Why wouldn\u2019t she just tell you not to wear it in the house? Toby\u2019s reaction is extreme too, but maybe he feels got at by you uncle. Everyone sucks, except you!", "Unless your uncle was completely unaware of your mother's boyfriend he was being a huge asshole.", "Toby is TA...he got upset over a shirt..A SHIRT.", "NTA, but your mom and Toby are. I\u2019m familiar with those shirts (there are a bunch from the same artist) and they\u2019re pretty funny. (I realize my humor is a bit dark, however.) \n\nThe problem is the gift was given to you, but Toby took it upon himself to destroy it. You weren\u2019t wearing it around him, you simply received it. I could maybe understand if you were a little kid or even his kid at all, but that\u2019s not the case. He (an adult) took your (another adult\u2019s) property and destroyed it. That\u2019s unacceptable behavior. If anything, he at least owes you the money your uncle spent on it since it was supposed to be your Xmas gift from him.", "NTA both your mom for showing it to Toby and Toby for destruction of property. He owes you the price of the shirt.\n\nIf you live with your mum and Toby it's time to move.", "Your uncle is TA for sending such shirt knowing that you are in same house as Toby.

Your uncle sent a gift that was designed to offend Toby, your mother didn't seem to mind until it also offended \\*her\\*, and ripping up the t-shirt seems very over the top on Toby's part.  You are definitely \\*an\\* A in this situation, don't delude yourself.", "I hope your uncle sends you a \u201cToby Sucks\u201d shirt next year.

If he had explained how this upset him, you may have volunteered to not wear the shirt where he would see it.   You are NTA, but I think your mother might be for putting her boyfriend ahead of her child.", "NTA you are nicer than me if I was you while your mom was lecturing you about the shirt not being cool in front of Toby I would have pointed out \"thats funny because when I opened it we BOTH had a good chuckle about it...but now all of a sudden its not cool? Okay. Noted.\" Especially since they both want to be AH about the gift you were GIVEN.", "NTA\n\nNow we know WHY the uncle sent a message for Toby.\n\nIt was disrespectful to Toby, but this guy has anger issues. I hope your mom does not marry him.", "I will go against the grain and call YTA as well. You should have immediately declined the gift as distasteful, not funny and threatening violence. In what world did your uncle think it was a nice gift? In the world where you are an A", "NTA. Why would your uncle set you up like that, lol. Like I am just imagining you walking about wearing that shirt around Toby, wild!", "Your mum and Toby are TA for their reactions - he shouldn't have wrecked your gift and your mum shouldn't have flipped on you to side with her boyfriend. Your uncle is TA for sending something he knew would provoke Toby - there's no way this wasnt deliberate especially since you mention your mum's family don't like Toby.
