Its something where you get a free beer for going to a brewery. Look it up its pretty cool.  Anyway, looking online at the place my wife and I were planning to go it said it was a dog friendly place.\n\nBoth my Wife and I are not dog people, we don't like them.  We do our best to avoid them and when they are present we don't interact with them, but are respectful.  Usually a gentle go away is enough.  Its amazing how many people expect you to interact with their dog though.  We knew it was possible that this was a place we wouldn't hang out at long, but went anyway to get our Pub Pass stamp and our free beer.   We didn't plan to be their more than 15 minutes.  This was just a taphouse with rotating food trucks.  No kitchen on site.\n\nWe arrive, head to the bar, and take our seat. Its apparent this place is very dog friendly based off the signage.  At the time we saw a few dogs but took seats as far away from dogs as possible.  Well within 2 minutes someone's unleashed dog comes walking up to us and sniffing around my wifes leg, she repositions and it keeps following.  We tell it to go away, it doesn't. I finally grab it by the collar and take it to the otherside of the bar and leave it.  Clearly the owner doesn't care if its wandering.  I go to wash my hands, and get gross dog germs off me.\n\nI come out, sit down, 2 minutes later the dog is back and now is licking me.  Finally, i just yell, \"who's effing dog is this?, effing come get it\". Finally a guy comes over and says \"oh fido is just being friendly, just give it some pets and he'll move along\".  I kinda flipped out, Told him I don't like his dog, i don't know his dog, i don't trust his dog, i don't want to be around it and not so kindly suggested he leash it and keep his dog near him.  My wife agrees with me, but the bartender essentially kicked us out based on my reaction.  So AITA?\n\nEdit:  I looked online at the breweries website.  It does mention leashes being required.  Obviously doesn't mean its enforced.

Same with kid friendly. You can bring the kid but you shouldn't let them run around unsupervised.\n\nHowever you didn't have to swear at the dog or the owner.

Better yet, call the attention of a person who works there and have them take care of it.", "LMAO. YTA.\n\n\"Wife and I went to a dog bar. I hate dogs. She hates dogs.

You knew there were dogs there. Then you grab the dog? Good for the bar owner to send you both packing.", "YTA your not wrong but you were an AH about it.  You screwed up when you didn\u2019t find the owner after grabbing the dog by the collar. Then you were a jerk about the dog to the owner. Your criticism is totally valid but you were rude", "INFO: are dogs allowed to be off leash in the brewery? You were honestly a dick by making a scene instead of just asking whose dog it was or asking a worker to deal with it. But \"dog friendly\" doesn't automatically mean \"off leash friendly\". I bring my dog to dog friendly breweries all the time but I'd never be comfortable bringing him to one with random loose dogs everywhere.", "YTA. This is quite despicable behaviour in my opinion and I can\u2019t understand why you even need a judgement on this. You know you don\u2019t like dogs. You still decide to go to a dog friendly place just because you want a free beer and a stamp? What exactly did you think was going to happen? Then a dog comes and sniffs around, does you absolutely no harm and you \u201cdrag his collar\u201d to the other side of the bar? The worst part hasn\u2019t even happened yet and you\u2019re already an asshole. Dog comes back and you proceed to start yelling about a dog being around you, at a dog friendly place. What exactly did you think could exonerate you from this situation? You decided to go to a place that is dog friendly when you\u2019re well aware you hate dogs and then you throw a tantrum about it. All for a free beer and a stamp. \n\nHope the dog\u2019s fine, you should\u2019ve been kicked out earlier when you dragged its collar.\n\nEDIT: Another thing, post history business kinda stuck with me. Making it really hard to trust what you're saying. As well as trying to skew the story in your favor in the comments by saying shit that obviously isn't true just to try and sway people who don't read the entire thing, such as claiming that it was a completely standard restaurant setup and not designed for dogs. But it was literally food trucks. How on earth is that standard? \n\nIdk, very difficult to trust this persons side of the story. I didn't like it initially since you're doing all of this crap for a free beer and a stamp, but you're also making it seem like you're trying to skew the story in your favor. Which you've also already attempted to do in the comments.", "YTA wtf causing that dramatic scene, a simple \u201ccan the owner of this dog come get him\u201d would have sufficed.  You acted like a nut job screaming vulgarities in front of kids on top of it if I owned the placed you\u2019d be permanently barred.

Very immature and miserable of you to flip out over an innocent animal being friendly.\n\nEdit: I know people are mentioning that though the bar is friendly, the dogs should still be on leashes as required. I have seen OP's edit, but from what we've heard, it didn't seem like the other patrons had an issue with the dogs being unleashed, nor did the bartender have any reason to enforce the rule. Dog-friendly does not mean unleashed, but this bar is different.", "Anyone else wondering what his real comment history has in it?? \ud83d\udc40", "YTA - listen, I would hate this place too. But know what I would do? Not go.\n\nIt\u2019s advertised as dog friendly, there\u2019s signage that it\u2019s dog friendly, it was obvious from first seeing it that it was dog friendly.

A dog-friendly place is not the place to go if you don\u2019t like them, but if you choose to go anyway, it\u2019s out of line to expect everyone and their dogs to work around you.", "I'm weird and would be in heaven. I'm the person getting all excited over random cats and dogs. Your reaction was absolutely over the top. If I saw someone possibly dragging my dog by the collar (because from the way you say you hate dogs and screamed about it I doubt it was a gentle lead away) I would probably be not very pleasant to deal with. If this was a child would you be screaming you hate their kid at the parents? Would you be swearing at them if their child approached you? Would you be drag the kid away by the collar of their shirt? Probably no. Give animals the same courtesy. My dog loves eeeeveryone. She is a jumper too. So I keep her on a tight leash when we are out with a harness that has a handle for better control if she gets too excited. I would not have her off leash.

Dern, are you the vegan that goes to a hamburger place and complains that they only serve hamburgers?", "NTA.  That dog should be leashed and supervised in a public place, full stop.

All it takes is one incident where the unleashed dog gets aggressive out of nowhere.", "YTA\n\nYou went to an obviously dog friendly place, got there and saw that it was very dog-welcoming and full of dogs, and proceeded to still expect to not be touched by, approached by, or in proximity of dogs.\n\nYou deserved to be kicked out.

Its something where you get a free beer for going to a brewery. Look it up its pretty cool.  Anyway, looking online at the place my wife and I were planning to go it said it was a dog friendly place.  \n\nBoth my Wife and I are not dog people, we don't like them.  We do our best to avoid them and when they are present we don't interact with them, but are respectful.  Usually a gentle go away is enough.  Its amazing how many people expect you to interact with their dog though.  We knew it was possible that this was a place we wouldn't hang out at long, but went anyway to get our Pub Pass stamp and our free beer.   We didn't plan to be their more than 15 minutes.  This was just a taphouse with rotating food trucks.  No kitchen on site.  \n\nWe arrive, head to the bar, and take our seat. Its apparent this place is very dog friendly based off the signage.  At the time we saw a few dogs but took seats as far away from dogs as possible.  Well within 2 minutes someone's unleashed dog comes walking up to us and sniffing around my wifes leg, she repositions and it keeps following.  We tell it to go away, it doesn't. I finally grab it by the collar and take it to the otherside of the bar and leave it.  Clearly the owner doesn't care if its wandering.  I go to wash my hands, and get gross dog germs off me.  \n\nI come out, sit down, 2 minutes later the dog is back and now is licking me.  Finally, i just yell, \"who's effing dog is this?, effing come get it\". Finally a guy comes over and says \"oh fido is just being friendly, just give it some pets and he'll move along\".  I kinda flipped out, Told him I don't like his dog, i don't know his dog, i don't trust his dog, i don't want to be around it and not so kindly suggested he leash it and keep his dog near him.  My wife agrees with me, but the bartender essentially kicked us out based on my reaction.  So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Uhh.\n\nESH\n\nYou don\u2019t have to use vulgarities I think? It seems a bit overboard to me. You could have just left the bar.\n\nThe person that the dog belong to should keep an eye out on the dog too, so his master doesn\u2019t go around licking strangers who don\u2019t want to be loved.", "Yta and andick don't go to somewhere that is dog friendly and throw a fit like a petulant child", "YTA for your reaction and how you handled things. The fact that you got kicked out is indicative of you going too far and/or being disrespectful. The dog owner was in the wrong for not having his dog on a leash, but you should've spoken to the staff instead of flipping out on the patron. They can enforce the rules. You can't.\n\nI do think it's a bit ridiculous that you went to a dog friendly pub when you clearly severely dislike dogs. Of course the leashing rules should've been followed, but you willingly put yourself in a dumb situation. I don't like cockroaches, which is why I don't visit the insectarium when I go to the zoo. Even if all of them are \"leashed\" up in their enclosures...why be around something I dislike?\n\nI'm a veterinary nurse. I love dogs. I would love a bar with dogs in it. But I really hate when people do not leash their dogs in public (unless they're in a designated off-leash place). It's not safe for the dog, and the reality is that most owners do not have good control of their dogs (despite thinking otherwise) and do not provide adequate training. How do I know this? Because I stitch up a lot of \"good/friendly\" dogs that should've been on a leash (and it breaks my heart every time). Everyone should know to respect boundaries, dogs included, for their own safety. So do I think you were right to expect the owners to be responsible for their dogs? Yes! Do I also think you were an asshole for how you went about it? Yes!", "YTA! It\u2019s an establishment that accepts dogs and obviously dogs off lead. If you didn\u2019t like it you should have just left. Swearing and overreacting is so childish.", "YTA. Based on your outburst. What bar owner wants to have to deal with someone picking a fight over the way they choose to run their bar. Especially when they gotta provide you with a free beer... Mad disrespectful.", "YTA\n\nIf you hate dogs, dont go to a bar full of dogs. And definitely dont manhandle someone elses animal when its doing you zero harm.\n\nShould it have been on a leash? Probably. But its pretty obvious that the guy wasnt doing anything out of the norms for this bar, and he wasnt singling you out, so I dont think hes the AH at all here. \n\nYou chose to enter clearly signposted dog-filled private property - it wasnt like the dog was out wandering the streets - and didnt like that a dog came near you. Instead of deciding you didnt like the atmosphere, it wasnt for you, and leaving - or having a private word with the bartender - you started shouting. Thats why you got kicked out.", "ESH. The owner should of been watching his dog better and had it on a leash. But your over the top reaction is what got you kicked out. You knew ahead of time that it was dog friendly and even had the choice of leaving when you realized there were unleashed dogs. You definitely could if handled it better, like asking the bartender politely if he knew who\u2019s dog it was. You don\u2019t trust/know the dog but you trusted it enough to grab it\u2019s collar and drag it across the room. Luckily the dog didn\u2019t bite you.", "OP, you \"do your best to avoid dogs\". \nApparently a free pub pass is enough to make your \"best effort\" succumb. \n\nYou have to expect that there will be dogs. \nYou have to expect that the dogs will roam around. \nIf you just cannot co-exist peacefully with them in the same space, than forego the free pass.

The dog owner should've kept his dog in a leash, but your reaction was over the top if you got kicked out for it.\n\nI think in general a lot of dog owners suck, because they can't understand that not everyone likes their dog, but that doesn't give you the right to verbally attack them. You could've handled this like an adult.", "ESA \n\nGuy should of had his dog on the lead, dog friendly doesn't mean roaming free.\n\nOn the other hand, your reaction sounded massively over the top.

You could've just asked who's dog it was and told the owner to keep away from you. No need to swear or flip out. Of course you got kicked out for that. Not for not liking a dog, but for the way you overreacted.", "NTA. The dog should be on a leash.", "ESH", "NTA. Just because a place is dog friendly does not mean the dogs get to harass people.", "I don't think you're an asshole, not everyone likes dogs. I have a very friendly dog and I always keep her on the lead at the pub because she would go around harassing everyone for attention.

The expectation is that you leave someone alone. \n\nIf the dog cannot stay with its owner (at the very least in his eyesight!) it is not able to be off leash in a public place. NTA", "NTA.
