They dated for almost 10 years. He was never that good to her though and he left when their kids were 4 and 2. My best friend and I remained best friends despite what my brother did. I have been a very big part of my niece and nephew's lives because I help her out by babysitting and generally we spend a lot of time together.\n\nMy niece and nephew are now 8 and 10. Two years ago my brother got married. SIL decided that since she was married to my brother she could make decisions for the kids on her own. She put a request in at the school that the parents wanted him to have her sister as his teacher. When my best friend was contacted she was furious. SIL also tried to change the kids doctor without informing anyone. To be fair my brother gave her permission to. But he can't even do it without my best friend and vice versa.\n\nThey ended up back in court and my brother was warned SIL could not interfere and an order was placed that she could not be part of official decision making for the kids. So she's not entitled to be at meetings with schools, doctors, etc.\n\nSIL interfered some more in extra curricular's and tried to move them without saying anything. This led to my brother getting less parenting time with the kids.\n\nThis is on my brother. I do understand that. But SIL is always so shocked when I'm not around them or I don't treat her like she's a part of the kids immediate family. She thinks I should be telling her more about the kids when they don't have them, etc. She also said it was wrong for me to stay in touch \"with the ex over my brother\".\n\nRecently SIL tried to say that my best friend had coached the kids to say mean things to her and to tell her that their dad shouldn't be married to her. I didn't believe her. Nobody in my family did. But she went hard on that and had some people outside of the family believing it. \n\nI have been extra distant since. At my niece's (not my brother's daughter but another niece) birthday party she confronted me for being \"distant\" and was saying I was treating her like shit. She was like why does nobody care that my best friend keep the kids from her and their dad. This is when I called her a snake and said she overstepped and my brother allowed it which is why he doesn't see his kids as much.\n\nShe accused me of being rude and taking too much out on her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695377140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p6bzy/aita_for_calling_my_sil_a_snake_to_her_face_and/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That said, don't lose your high ground by throwing insults in the mix. Have a straightforward conversation with her about boundaries and expectations. You're the aunt, not the mom or dad. Why are you locked in confrontations about kids that aren't yours? Honestly ridiculous to me. If she needs updates so badly, she should ask her husband.", "NTA\n\n I mean, a family court judge literally agreed with you. He is the one that decided brother gets less time.

Your SIL seems incapable of believing that the kids formed *their own* opinions of her and don't need their mother coaching them.  Let's look at her actions that could have caused her step kids to hate her all on their own:\n\n* Requesting her sister be the teacher of one of the kids and phrasing it as \"their parents\" want this change, rather than \"stepmom and dad.\"\n* Trying to change their doctor.  The kids could like their doctor and didn't want to change.  Luckily, she failed.\n* Told by the court to knock it off.\n* Ignoring the court's instructions and interfering in the extracurricular activities\n* Causing their father to get less time with his kids because she can't get it through her thick skill that she isn't their mother and has no right to make decisions for them.  He refuses to tell her to stop.\n\nGee, I wonder why the kids are saying mean things to her and saying their dad shouldn't have married her.  It isn't because their mother told them to, it's SIL's own actions that have made them hate her and have kept the kids from their dad.  You gave her a reality check that she didn't want.\n\nNext time she brings it up tell her \"SIL the court decided to reduce his time with the kids because he has failed to stop *you* from trying to make decisions that the court has already said you have no say in.  *You* are the reason he sees his kids less, not best friend.  Best friend didn't have to coach the kids to say those things to you, they are old enough to understand that your actions are why they have seen their dad less.  They rightly blame you for it.  Back off and quit violating the court order.\"", "Tell her to eff off.\n\nNTA", "> why don't my husband and I see the kids as much? \n\nWell gosh, SIL, I'm not sure...let's check what this actual Judge said the reason is?

You told her the truth. Hate it for her that she didn't like the truth, but it is what it is. I don't see how you could be an asshole when you didn't just take it upon yourself to tell you SIL about herself, instead she was the one that started the situation.", "NTA\n\nIf it slithers and hisses\u2026it\u2019s a snake.", "But, but she had permission from her husband to do that and she only had their best interests as their mother at heart!  She didn't do anything wrong!  The courts are being so mean to her (heavy sarcasm by the way).\n\nThey have a mom; they don't need her.", "Well, it\u2019s kinda insulting snakes. That makes her TA. They\u2019re innocent animals and there\u2019s even species that for lifelong mating bonds! Garter snakes have best friends! But yeah, SIL is an asshole", "Yeah this is what I was thinking too.  It sounds like there\u2019s a long list of reasonable items she could list off as to why she has an issue with her SIL.  Once you get into name calling you give up some of the high ground.   I\u2019m sure tempers were flaring a bit."]}
