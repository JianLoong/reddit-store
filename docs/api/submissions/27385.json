Two years ago my brother got married. SIL decided that since she was married to my brother she could make decisions for the kids on her own.

But he can't even do it without my best friend and vice versa.\n\nThey ended up back in court and my brother was warned SIL could not interfere and an order was placed that she could not be part of official decision making for the kids. So she's not entitled to be at meetings with schools, doctors, etc.\n\nSIL interfered some more in extra curricular's and tried to move them without saying anything. This led to my brother getting less parenting time with the kids.\n\nThis is on my brother. I do understand that. But SIL is always so shocked when I'm not around them or I don't treat her like she's a part of the kids immediate family.

At my niece's (not my brother's daughter but another niece) birthday party she confronted me for being \"distant\" and was saying I was treating her like shit. She was like why does nobody care that my best friend keep the kids from her and their dad.

The kids could like their doctor and didn't want to change.

He refuses to tell her to stop.\n\nGee, I wonder why the kids are saying mean things to her and saying their dad shouldn't have married her.

There\u2019s a group of snakes in Asia that pair bond for life, and have a complex hierarchy of vassals to the dominant pair and raise their young communally. Very interesting stuff.  But we\u2019re discovering more and more species that seem to be more social than we thought. Rattle snakes, for example, den in the hundreds during the winter. And when a garter snake gets cold, if another garter snake is around that\u2019s warm, they\u2019ll let the cold one sit on top of them to take their heat. King cobras are known to peacefully approach humans during drought to ask for water, and allow themselves to be pet while it\u2019s being given (you can find videos of this online.) Also, they\u2019re not cobras.

Your brother is still going to consult his wife on every decision, a court can't mandate who he sees advice from. It's just an utterly pointless exercise and I only see it in to circumstances - 1) when step is actually toxic (curses out the parent, violent, abusive etc) or 2) when the relationship is so full of spite ppl have forgotten this isn't about them it's about the children.\n\nWhen my clients say to me that they don't want the new step at meetings I always say to them that whether the step is at the meeting or not they will influence your ex's decision, strategically it is smarter to have them in the room and hear their opinion first hand.", "NTA, she has no boundaries which makes her an AH.
