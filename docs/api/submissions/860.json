Your sister puts her daughter to bed, then stays out all night and part of the next morning leaving you no choice but to watch her daughter until she comes home?  I mean, it doesn't really matter because you are NTA.  Your niece is your sister's responsibility.  Parenting is a full time job, especially when they are this little.  You don't get much time to yourself and you have to deal with it.  There is no reason you should have to watch your niece if you want your own time.  She is not your responsibility.", "NTA. You're just asking her to...be a parent", "Nta- you are not obligated to watch your niece, however if you want to/ it would be a nice gesture to suggest you will watch her once a week/fortnight/ whatever is convenient for you. That way she gets some time child free too :)", "NTA\n\nshe's doing this without asking, by itself, is a AH move. You didn't have a kid, she did. She should be taking care of the child or finding resources to do that. If that's you, you deserve the respect of being asked.", "NTA\n\nshe\u2019s out late night and has mornings off - sounds like she gets plenty time to herself. Hell when is she with the kid just the afternoons?\n\nYou\u2019re playing mom by watching her in the morning and working evenings.. she isn\u2019t your sister wife.\n\nYou\u2019re being taken advantage of and she\u2019s in denial of what it\u2019s like to be a mom if she isn\u2019t paying you for childcare.", "NTA to talk to someone about it.  See what she says.  You are doing her a huge favor.  Are you staying with her for free?  If you aren't paying rent, then that is another story.  It doesn't mean she can just dump her daughter on you, but then you have a different decision to make.  If you are staying there rent free, she is doing you a HUGE favor.", "NTA, you are being nice and helpful but your sisters starting to take advantage of that, just need to set a boundary with her that it's not you job to constantly watch her kid", "Nta\nIf she wants time to herself, she shouldn't have had a kid.", "NTA parents get very little.time to themselves when their kids are young, such is life. A mother doesn't put her kid to bed and go out to see a man every night, at least not a good mother. She needs to be home for her child, this is neglect as far as I can tell.", "NTA.  She chose to have a kid, not you. If she wants you to babysit she can cough up that $$$", "INFO. So your sister is out several times a week until 1p.m. the next day? That\u2019s more than you just missing your mornings. You are responsible for your very young niece all through the night and until the next afternoon. What if she has a nightmare? Do none of you work during the day including your sister\u2018s new bf? Why doesn\u2019t he stay in your house and leave before the child wakes up?", "NTA There is a reason your sister just leaves and doesn't actually ask you. She is taking advantage of you and making sure you don't have a chance to say no. I understand that your sister may not have a lot of time to herself, but that is one of the things you sign on for when you have a child. That doesn't excuse her being rude and dumping your niece on you. No matter how much you love your niece, it is not your responsibility to take care of her without so much as a please or thank you.", "NTA. Your sister would be super lucky to have you watch your niece once a week. Unless she's paying you in some way (cash or trade), she shouldn't be just leaving her kid with you. You, however, need to speak up, because she may not know you're feeling burnt out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Though I can see why you'd say that, and your not wrong. I appreciate your response, thank you!", "Yeah she asked a couple times in the beginning and I always said yes, because I usually don't work until later in the afternoon.

I had a feeling she may have just been taking advantage since I never decline. Much appreciated!", "Yeah pretty much.

Appreciate your answer, thanks!", "She asked in the beginning but like I mentioned I've been doing this for a a couple months already, and I guess she just assumes that I'll take care of her until 1 ish (my niece wakes up around 10).

It's not an everyday thing, but you are right, definitely gonna talk to her about it.", "i\u2019d rather pay rent than play mommy to someone else\u2019s kid. 4x a week is more than she\u2019s watching her own kid.", "Figured this was the case, thanks for your answer!", "I can understand how this looks, but I promise she's not neglectful at all, though you are right, and I appreciate your response thank you!", "Right, but it can be planned ahead.\n\"Tomorrow I'd like to linger for morning cuddles, is that okay?\" \nAnd otherwise, she can be home.\n\nHer morning coffee isn't MORE important than yours.\n\n(Also a mom. \u2764\ufe0f)", "NTA.  You may love this child completely but you are NOT the parent. Your sister stopped asking because now she EXPECTS you to take care of HER child.  She may want more time with her bf but she needs to be a full-time mother.\n\nThe first time it's appreciated. The second time it's accepted. The third time it's expected. Put up some boundaries.

But can you please clear up a bit of INFO?\n\nHow does this all work?\n\nYou started up top with \"down for bed\" and I assumed night-time. But now you are down here talking about \"afternoon\" and \"in the morning\".\n\nSo when exactly is you sister doing this? And what exactly are you expected to do?\n\n(Still, all the NTAs. She is clearly taking advantage of you. Im just hoping for some clarification about all this)", "she\u2019s absolutely taking advantage. you can tell by the way she assumes it\u2019s okay. 4x a week is literally more than she does it. that\u2019s a problem. it\u2019s not like she\u2019s out working or something, right?", "I do actually pay my half of the house, lol. But like I've said, I never had a problem, until recently when I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. Appreciate yalls input!", "Basically she'll put her daughter down to bed around 8pm, and leave the house around an hour later. She would then come home the next day around 12-1pm. But I already talked to her and she agreed she'll be there in the morning from here on out, so it's all settled!", "If you know what you are willing to do, tell her.  Is it ok if she is gone all night several nights a week if she gets back before her daughter wakes up?  Do you want her to ask you every time?  The hard part for me is to figure out what i'm willing to do long term.  You might also tell her that you might change your mind in the future about how much you are willing to do.", "Jeebus! Im glad you've worked it out so quickly (and easily?).\n\nBecause that is just bonkers!!! She was straight up leaving the house for like 15-16hrs, multiple times a week, without even asking you!!!", "Not coming back home until 1pm the next day isn\u2019t appropriate without letting you know. What if you had plans, or didn\u2019t realize your sister wasn\u2019t there and left the home and your niece alone? You\u2019re not TA and need to set boundaries and your sister needs to be more responsible and communicate."]}
