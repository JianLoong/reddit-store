We were only seeing each other for 3 months so we\u2019ve never discussed moving in together. I was surprised when he asked me to move in. He promised it\u2019ll be for a month, two tops and then he\u2019ll find someplace else.\n\nIt\u2019s been okay living with him and he\u2019s stayed until now as he\u2019s still looking for a job.\n\nI inherited a house after my grandparents which I own on my own. It\u2019s got a ground floor with sitting room, kitchen, bathroom, drawing room (it\u2019s not an actual room, it\u2019s more like patio with windows around it).\nUpstairs, there\u2019s a master bedroom and a bathroom. It used to have 2 other bedrooms but I run a small business for a living  (think Etsy and stuff) and I have been very successful for the passed 5 years so I remodelled those 2 bedrooms into a huge office which I need for work. \n\nI wasn\u2019t made aware of this before he moved in but he has a 12 year old son that he sees once a month. I haven\u2019t met him yet but Ash wants it to happen soon. \n\nAsh started hinting that we should do some changes and paint and change the office into two bedrooms like it used to be (he saw photos) so I can use one as an office and one for his son.\n\nMy first reaction was \u201cabsolutely not!\u201d I explained that I need my office the way it is and can\u2019t downsize it, especially now, during Christmas rush. He pushed and I clarified that I am not going to make a bedroom for a child I haven\u2019t even met yet and he only sees once a month.\n\nHe started crying and called me a selfish bitch. He started saying that I didn\u2019t care if he has a bond with his son and he couldn\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t want to meet him.\n\nTo make matters worse, he keeps pushing me to do it, sending me photos of boy\u2019s rooms, making a wishlist for amazon and every time we meet my or his friends, he tells everyone that I don\u2019t want his child have his own bedroom and I may turn into an evil stepmother.\n\nI keep having to do damage control but some people believe him and think I\u2019m a bitch. And my head is a mess, I\u2019m starting to think I may be selfish here considering the boy lives with his mother and siblings and he shares his room with 4 other kids.\n\nam I the asshole for not wanting to convert my office into my boyfriends son bedroom?", "created_utc": 1669052344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z14wok/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_rid_off_my_office_so/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You agreed initially that he was going to stay a couple of months at the most. He'd already failed to follow through on one agreement. How do you know he isn't planning to move his kid in and have him there more than once a month? Why would you remodel and sacrifice your workspace for a child who's only there once a month. This guy has been dishonest with you at every turn: he didn't tell you about the kid at the start of the relationship, he's overstayed at your house and he still hasn't managed to find a job in that time. NTA. You aren't responsible for a child that you haven't ever even met. Imo it would be a good idea to get rid of this manipulative dad as well. He's taking advantage of you.", "NTA.  BF needs to move out.  Yesterday.  He's getting very comfortable with your house.  How long does the child even stay?  A couple of days?  Fix up an air mattress in one of the downstairs spaces and call it a day.   But, truly,  get the BF out of your house while you can.", "NTA. For someone who is basically homeless and relying on your goodwill, this bloke seems awfully entitled. Even on a strictly utilitarian level, even if you knew and loved this kid, setting aside a room for him to use once a month would be inane.\n\nHow much to bet he wants the kid to move in full time?", "Guy finds girl who is financially independent home owner. Guy 'loses' job and moves in after only three months for 'a month or two'.

Girl would be NTA for kicking guy out on his ass, STAT.", "Congratulations, you have found a hobosexual. A person who goes from relationship to relationship so they have a place to sleep.

Dude's asking this when this move was supposed to be temporary. nope nope nope. I don't trust this guy.", "NTA. This man started dating you and within months wanted to move there \"for just a month or two\". Now you find out about a son that needs a room at your place. How long has he been staying with you? You need to get him out ASAP. That man is going to get himself some squatters rights or try to baby trap you, you need him out like yesterday!", "NTA. Please break up with him. Now before he gets in any deeper. He is using you. It was supposed to be a month. You can meet his kid when bf takes you both to a restaurant to meet. Get this leech out of your house! Or one day you may just come home to a surprise redecorated office!", "NTA, this man is manipulating you like hell. Get out.", "NTA and you need to kick this guy out ASAP. If he's only going to live there for 2 months and sees kid (you didn't know about?) once a month - he wants you to spend $$ to reno for maybe two visits?

What are you doing ?", "DUMP THIS MAN", "NTA and your bf is being extremely manipulative to the point where you should be asking it this relationship is a good fit.", "NTA - Kick this guy to the curb. He is acting like an entitled child. You never should have let him move in with you in the first place. He is using you and has been from the start. You are not responsible for housing a deadbeat you barely know.", "Nta. Kick him out. Why would someone you barely know who doesn't even have a job have a say at all? He's behaving like a lazy, unemployed, self-important liar.", "NTA...is showing you who is. Believe him. He's a taker. In this economy he should have been able to get a job. The fact that he moved in without telling you he had a son and then DEMANDING that you rearrange your house for a kid that will be there 1x a month. Then when he doesn't get his way he yells, pouts and calls you names. Please kick him out", "NTA. It's your house and you pay the bills, so you can decide how you want it modeled, especially since your actually use the rooms for your personal business. I do feel bad for the kid, but it's really not your fault he's in the situation he's in, and there are some big red flags coming from your boyfriend that you should probably assess for yourself.", "NTA- You need to kick this entitled mooch out. You let him move in after 3 months of dating when he lost his job. Now months later and still no job but a surprise son you never knew about. He's trying to dictate what you do with your office that is important to your business and using friends to make you feel guilty for saying no. This sounds pretty planned out to me but that might just be me.", "NTA\nYou haven\u2019t been dating this guy long and he wasn\u2019t forthcoming with big news (having a child). Plus he is unemployed and living off of you (unless he is paying you with his savings?). Now he wants to change up your home for his benefit and is trying to make your friends turn against you.\n\nPlease rethink this relationship and end things cuz he doesn\u2019t seem worth it.", "NTA and you need to dump this guy. He weasels his way into your house after three months of dating and FOUR MONTHS LATER still hasn't found a job so he can contribute. And now he wants to take over your office and is calling you names when you won't go along with it?!\n\nDude - please - serve this man eviction papers and move on with your life.", "NTA. Show him the door.", "NTA this guy is just trying to up end your life after afew months of dating. You honestly havent invested enough time in this relationship where you should cut it off get him out of the house before it gets harder.", "NTA\n\nWhat does he bring to the table for you? \n\nHe sounds like an unemployed freeloader to me. Is he helping you pay bills? Is he helping out around the house? \n\n4 Months is more than enough time to get a job. \n\nThe fact that he called you a selfish bitch speaks volume. I wouldn\u2019t take that and if I were you I would rethink this \u201crelationship\u201d", "NTA but you need to evict him. He pushed you to move in.", "NTA.\n\nYou mean EX-boyfriend?", "NTA. Dump him. He can't be that close to his son if you were together for months and never knew about him. I feel like it would be different if you had a room that you used for eg. Storage and refused to turn that into a bedroom, but you run a business from home.", "NTA OP, \n\nYour \"BF\" needs to get himself a new job and get his own place. Give him 30 days notice to move out. If he hasn't got a job then, he still needs to find somehwere else to live. Because asking you to change YOUR Home and Business to suit him is 100% ridiculous. \n\nAlso, for what it's worth. I don't think you  have a BF, I think you have a mooching worm pretending to be a BF. He is clearly not your \"friend\" or he wouldn't be asking for you to do this. I'm guessing he has a long history of not being able to keep jobs. You are financially independent, hard working and own a home (even if you inheited it.) So he sees you as his meal ticket. At this point, he's not capable of being a partner. \n\nAlso, If he's not working, how is he paying his child support?", "NTA he is literally trying to manipulate you in front of others by prefacing you as an evil stepmother....this probably won't change with time at least he showed you his true colors so early on", "Girllll please respect yourself. Do not stay in this relationship one minute longer. Your boyfriend is using you and absolutely stomping your boundaries. The fact that you even typed this thinking you were in any way shape or form an asshole (NTA, by the way) just goes to show that he is already succeeding in making you doubt yourself / messing with your mind. \n\nKick him to the curb.", "NTA- but you should really kick this man out!!! All he\u2019s bringing to this relationship is THE AUDACITY", "NTA but Omg. So. Many. Red. Flags. Kick him out now before me tries to manipulate you in to putting the house in his name. Wow.", "NTA, but you are an idiot.  You let a guy without a job move in with you when you'd only known him a few months.  And now surprise, surprise he's still there.  Is he working yet? \n\nNow he wants to take over your house and is trying to manipulate you by saying you'll be a \"bad stepmother\".  And you're buying into it.", "Hahaha \n\nYour boyfriend is never moving out and he\u2019s never paying rent. If you make a bedroom for his kid, consider yourself the proud mommy to two teenagers!", "NTA. You realize how ridiculous this is, right? He\u2019s using you for a place to live. There is no reason he doesn\u2019t have a job right now, even if it is part time in fast food.", "NTA.  Remind him he's supposed to be moving in for 1 month, 2 max.", "NTA. I feel like you're being used and are blind to it. \n\nHe sees his kid once a month. The kid doesn't need a dedicated bedroom. It would be nice if you have a guest room but you don't so you make do however. In your case I would ask the boyfriend when he plans to get his own place since you will not be changing your house to suit his needs", "Red flags, my friend. NTA", "NTA. He is the ass. Tell him he can have a bedroom for his son in is own House, you make and arrangement that he living with you was only temporality. He is living with you more that you agred. \nIf he want a room for his son, he can find a job asap and ha place for himself. \nThis is your House and you are make him a favor. \nHe as no right to ask for that if he realy is tinking to move out. \nRED FLAG here. You have a problem in your House right now.", "NTA But it's time to get tur BF to move out", "NTA who's pocket book is paying for this remodel?\nSounds like bf needs to stay in a hotel while his son visits and then slowly introduce the two of you. It's crazy to think the kid is going ti stay the night in a home of someone he doesn't know.", "This hombre has no plans on moving out. Why would he need a room painted and furnished for his son when he is only planning on being there for a month or two?\n\n>He started crying and called me a selfish bitch.\n\nAw helllll no. That would be the end of the relationship if I were you.", "NTA.\n\nSo, a homeless, jobless, lying, mooch who lives off your generosity calls you a selfish bitch *to your face*, and he still lives with you? He doesn't even like you!\n\nSeriously? \n\nThis guy is either breathtakingly stupid or thinks he's got the completely under his thumb and is teaching you what to expect next time you're disobedient. Which is it?", "NTA, but dear lord, why do you still let him live with you, not mentioning still dating him?\n\nYou took his unemployed homeless ass in and as a thank you he is badmouthing you to your friends? Are you insane? Why do you let this happen to you?", "NTA my god this man found himself a really sweet deal, huh? I hate all of this for you. I\u2019m a bonus mom and it\u2019s my world\u2019s greatest joy. This man is looking for a new mom for himself and his kid. Because he\u2019s the kind of man who makes his partner his mommy. I\u2019d get out now.", "Nta three months is too soon to start living together imo, and he invited himself and now doing the same with his kid, you are not reaponsible for his child needs, and how someone who is jobless is planning redo a boy's room? When he say \"we\" means you be the one paying for it. He is public pressuring you into doing this. Try telling a friend at the time your reasons for needing your space and if people take his side good riddance on them.", "Nta.  You need the space for work and you dont need a room if he comes over once a month.  The kid can sleep on a couch.  Also, he has no right to make demands and you should probably reevaluate your relationship.  He sounds like a deadbeat to me", "NTA\nGet the dude out of your house NOW!", "NTA- sounds like your boyfriend is manipulating you\u2026 big red flags asking to move in with you after briefly dating, bigger red flag not mentioning he had a kid till he moved in AND huge red flag demanding you renovate. Ask him to leave ASAP", "Tell your boyfriend that his son can have his own room in his new place.

The house is yours and you were only trying to help him get back on his feet.  You shouldn\u2019t have to feel bad that you don\u2019t want to provide for his child that you never met or even knew existed.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds extremely manipulative.  Do yourself a favor and kick him out of your house and life.", "NTA - it is easy to get a job this time of year, and you haven't met the kid yet! Try a blow-up mattress or a rollout for the once-a-month.

We were only seeing each other for 3 months so we\u2019ve never discussed moving in together. I was surprised when he asked me to move in. He promised it\u2019ll be for a month, two tops and then he\u2019ll find someplace else.\n\nIt\u2019s been okay living with him and he\u2019s stayed until now as he\u2019s still looking for a job.\n\nI inherited a house after my grandparents which I own on my own. It\u2019s got a ground floor with sitting room, kitchen, bathroom, drawing room (it\u2019s not an actual room, it\u2019s more like patio with windows around it).\nUpstairs, there\u2019s a master bedroom and a bathroom. It used to have 2 other bedrooms but I run a small business for a living  (think Etsy and stuff) and I have been very successful for the passed 5 years so I remodelled those 2 bedrooms into a huge office which I need for work. \n\nI wasn\u2019t made aware of this before he moved in but he has a 12 year old son that he sees once a month. I haven\u2019t met him yet but Ash wants it to happen soon. \n\nAsh started hinting that we should do some changes and paint and change the office into two bedrooms like it used to be (he saw photos) so I can use one as an office and one for his son.\n\nMy first reaction was \u201cabsolutely not!\u201d I explained that I need my office the way it is and can\u2019t downsize it, especially now, during Christmas rush. He pushed and I clarified that I am not going to make a bedroom for a child I haven\u2019t even met yet and he only sees once a month.\n\nHe started crying and called me a selfish bitch. He started saying that I didn\u2019t care if he has a bond with his son and he couldn\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t want to meet him.\n\nTo make matters worse, he keeps pushing me to do it, sending me photos of boy\u2019s rooms, making a wishlist for amazon and every time we meet my or his friends, he tells everyone that I don\u2019t want his child have his own bedroom and I may turn into an evil stepmother.\n\nI keep having to do damage control but some people believe him and think I\u2019m a bitch.\n\nI need an opinion, am I the asshole for not wanting to convert my office into my boyfriends son bedroom?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He probably thinks if you have a house and the son has a room he can fight for more custody and be a stay at home dad.", "RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE, holy shit so so so so NTA. \n\nRed Flag #1: Asking to move in after three months. Based on his recent behavior, it\u2019s likely that he was lovebombing you (please look at up, abusers commonly move the relationship at an accelerated pace to insert themselves into your life quickly before you can see their true colors). \n\nRed Flag #2: Hiding the fact that he had a son from you\n\nRed Flag #3: Acting entitled over a space that you own, a space that HE HIMSELF promised he\u2019d only be in for 1-2 months (a promise that he has already broken). \n\nRed Flag #4: He only sees his son once a month\n\nRed Flag #5: He is presumably still unemployed and living rent-free in your home and expects you to pay to re-renovate the space to reverse the work you already paid to do. AKA he feels entitled not just to your space but to your money, in spite of the fact that he is contributing nothing (I assume) to your home and its maintenance. \n\nMASSIVE Red Flag #6: He is not only ignoring your very reasonable boundaries, he is escalating his attempts to try to manipulate you to do what he wants. He has not respected your very reasonable refusals. This is a huge huge huge red flag, and he will continue to stomp all over your boundaries in increasingly invasive ways the longer you stay with him. \n\nGlaring Red Flag #7: In the process of stomping all over your boundaries, he is also DARVO-ing you. I\u2019m specifically referring to his temper tantrum at being told no where he cried and called you a selfish bitch for *checks notes* refusing to fund a redundant home renovation in the home you own that would also hinder your ability to make money with the VERY BUSINESS THAT WOULD BE FUNDING THE RENOVATION. DARVO (please google this one too) stands for Deny-Attack-Reverse Victim and Offender. It\u2019s a manipulation tactic that abusers use to make you feel like the bad guy when you don\u2019t do what they want. This guy sees his son once a month and is trying to blame YOU for him not having a good relationship with his son??????? GTFO\n\nRed Flag #8: He is trying to poison the well against you by spreading his (likely full of shit) version of events to people you both know to make you look like the bad guy. Again, this is an abuse tactic designed to turn others against you and make you seem crazy and unreasonable so if you ever speak out about what he\u2019s doing, they won\u2019t believe you. This is an isolation tactic. \n\nRed Flag #9: You say you\u2019re feeling confused and starting to doubt yourself. The reason you feel confused is because he\u2019s likely psychologically and emotionally abusing you. Please please please research signs you\u2019re being emotionally/psychologically abused, I\u2019d be willing to bet a lot of them will ring true for you.\n\nOP, I am fired up here but none of it is at you. I am worried for you and this behavior will only get worse, and the fact that it has only been 7 months tells me that it will likely escalate fast. \n\nYou seem kind and reasonable and lovely and I just want to encourage you to live and die by your gut. Deep down you probably know that something feels majorly off with this. Trust that and do not listen to a word he says. He\u2019s manipulating you and I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to start planning how to get him out of your house permanently.

Power imbalance in couples is difficult even for 'seasoned' couples. He is already indebted to you. Regardless of how he acts, you both feel it. For some people, this makes them feel insecure, and they handle this by subtly trying to bring the other person down, often through subtle or unsubtle negging. Please think through if this has happened to you. Also, if it wasn't for you, would he be homeless? Extreme power imbalance. Not healthy in any relationship, downright dangerous in new ones.\n\n2. Entitlement: you are in a relationship. It seems serious. But how is it he seems to find it fair to make demands of your home? It is not his. If he acted in any way humble about this, and took your no for an answer, I wouldn't be concerned. This seems not to be the case. I wonder why he feels entitled to space that isn't his.\n\n3.
