That\u2019s something he needs to work on; it\u2019s not your fault, and he cannot selfishly demand you compromise your comfort and access to communal space in your shared home. He\u2019s being over reactive, especially since you\u2019ve actively expressed permission for him to continue watching porn despite the fact you\u2019re not totally comfortable. If anything he probably senses that you\u2019re not 100% okay with it, but he continues to do it anyway, and perhaps there\u2019s a sense of embarrassment or guilt there over the fact he is persisting to do something he senses makes you uneasy.\n\nAs for your comfort level, and the fact that this sounds like a regular occurrence, perhaps an open and honest conversation is overdue about boundaries, expectations, and your shared intimacy balanced with a need for solo release.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nProviding an anecdote here, if you want to read it for a perhaps similar experience and the consequences of it when handled with effective communication. If your boyfriend respects you at all, there should come a compromise similar to this.\n\nDuring the first year of our relationship, my fianc\u00e9 would watch porn of other men while I was asleep and sometimes I\u2019d wake up and catch him. It made me feel like shit because there\u2019s a bit of an age gap between us, so his experience of homosexuality growing up is largely different to mine which really impacted the kind of queer he is, in the sense that he\u2019s a very macho sort of man into rough and tumble type, \u201cstraight passing\u201d boys. It was reflected in his porn, all these chavvy, \u201cstraight but not straight\u201d guys in typical \u201cboys will be boys\u201d scenarios where everything\u2019s a bit gay but not really until the sex happens. In other words, he was looking at boys who were completely different to me. I\u2019m in no way typically camp or feminine, but I am very much your more nerdy, anti-toxic masculinity, fuck gender roles kinda man.\nTo further contextualise this, one of his google searches was \u201cmates in bed\u201d. Like c\u2019mon, repressed much?\n\nI expressed to him that I didn\u2019t like what he was watching, as it made me feel insecure, especially as this was during a time when our sex life had hit a dry period and we were having sex less regularly than usual, and he was having some continuity issues. I explained that it felt like he was watching that type of porn because he was into guys like that and that was why he wasn\u2019t initiating anything with me, and that I was feeling like he wasn\u2019t actually attracted to me. Moreover, what bothered me the most is that he was doing it when I was asleep and trying to hide the fact. Him making it seem like a dirty little secret made it feel worse, like there was an underlying reason for it that would hurt me if I found out. If he\u2019d been watching it openly, I would\u2019ve minded a lot less because it would\u2019ve felt like something normal and I could\u2019ve gotten myself to a place where I felt comfortable with it. I even suggested watching it with him sometimes, and mutual masturbation if sex was too much for him some days. But the fact he was hiding it made it feel sordid. This was a topic a couple of more times before he properly took stuff on board.\n\nI told him that I didn\u2019t mind him wanking, and if anything I encouraged it because masturbation can help with maintaining a healthy sex drive and that would positively impact our sex life together. But if he was going to watch porn he needed to be open about it or just not watch it at all.\n\nHe was as reassuring towards me as he was capable of in that first year (I\u2019m his first proper relationship due to several factors in his history that I won\u2019t disclose, but suffice to say he was very closed off when we first met), and it took a little work but eventually he completely cut out the porn and I stopped waking up suddenly feeling anxious and expecting to find him watching more men that look nothing like me. Our sex life did pick up again too. Expressing how his actions made me feel, and his willingness to listen and adjust his behaviour was what solved our porn versus partner issue. \n\nThese days we both work a lot and we have 4 kids,, so the frequency has once again dwindled, but when we do have sex it\u2019s amazing and we have none of the continuity issues we had towards the end of our first year and the start of our second year together. And he still doesn\u2019t watch porn anymore.\nWe\u2019ve been together for 4 years and I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.", "He should definitely not be masturbating in the living room with you home, if this annoys either you or him.\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t annoy you\u2026 it\u2019s still slobbish and dirty behaviour.", "NTA. Although my wife still gets startled by me when we spend quite literally every waking (and sleeping) moment together in our apartment. \nIf I walk into the bathroom whilst she\u2019s in the shower she acts like she\u2019s about to have a heart attack from the shock, assuming that it\u2019s not me and is in fact a home invader that skipped every other room and has gone straight for her.\n\nAlso he shouldn\u2019t be watching porn anyway as that\u2019s just emotional cheating in my eyes.", "NTA.

OP should also make her own needs addressed as well to OPs' Boyfriend. Communicate ur sexual needs nd find a common ground where both can be satisfied and not need to masterbate to porn. A more emotional and intimate connection through sex can really boost ur boyfriend sex drive if OP is meeting boyfriends needs. Same goes for OP too.

Sometimes, a person can want to masturbate without wanting to have sex with someone. Sometimes the opposite. Sometimes they just want sexual release and either would do. OP masturbating doesn't mean he wants sex rn with his partner.\n\n- Maybe the girlfriend herself doesn't want sex at this time. Her being with someone doesn't make her \"available\" for sex 24/7, or even every single second she spends not being busy doing something else. Sometimes you just don't want sex. In this case, why not masturbate if you want to get sexual pleasure while your partner doesn't? There's no harm in masturbating.\n\n- The expectation that a partner should fulfill every tiny desire and envy at all times is not very healthy. Circles back to the previous point. People are human beings, not available sex dolls once they get with someone. A couple can't magically fully fulfill you as such, as it is composed of humans.\n\n- Watching porn isn't disrespectful in itself. It CAN be. People have different reasons to watch porn and relate to porn very differently. People can watch porn to see beautiful people they're attracted to. I find they're not the majority. Others watch it just to see a sexual *act* and that in itself is arousing, sometimes through empathy with the people represented in the video (ex : a straight woman getting aroused seeing another woman receiving pleasure because she'd want the same done to her and is imagining the act itself). Some watch it to get into a sexual mood better, with basically the sounds and overall vibe. You can't dictate that porn itself is disrespectful when you have no idea why the guy in this couple watches it and when both parties in the couple are fine with it and happy.\n\nThe only issue here is the guy doing it in a shared space and expecting privacy and then getting mad at his gf for just living in her home and for his own feelings and lack of consideration/planification.", "Trying to control what your partner does with their body is pretty unhinged.\n\nNot to mention using expressions like \"get him away\" with that, \"disrespecting\" and \"doormat\".", "Disagree, these kind of conversations are important.
