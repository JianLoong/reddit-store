Good for you for laying down a boundary that you're not going to be shoved out of the way by selfish man. Nta", "Updated vote based on response: gentle ESH. OP was unaware of American\u2019s boarding policy and the other traveler should\u2019ve gone directly to the gate agent or explained why he was allowed to board ahead of Group 6+. \n\nWhether or not you\u2019re the AH depends on which airline you were flying, tbh. I travel frequently (frequently enough to have had award status on 2-3 airlines since 2017) and several of the major airlines have policies that allow earlier groups to skip the line entirely/go ahead of later groups regardless of when those passengers actually show up. If you\u2019re in Group 1-4 on American, for instance, you\u2019re always welcome to use the Priority lane (edit: and cut ahead of everyone else). So, while I understand your impulse and annoyance, the answer is really \u201cit depends.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s why he should have been in the boarding area and ready when his group was called.", "NTA. He had his shot at boarding with his group. When they call 1/6, that\u2019s the call for everybody remaining to line up and get on. If you\u2019re in group one, good for you. Back of the line.", "NTA and GOOD JOB for holding your own!\n\nAnd for clarity, if he was in Zone 5, that group is not included in Priority Boarding (https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/boarding-process.jsp).", "NTA. If you don't go to the gate when your group is called you don't get to skip the line. Groups are boarding sections not boarding priority. Once the next group is called you have to wait in line *with* that group.", "Nta. I\u2019m usually in group A or B but wait til the last group boards so I can spend as much time NOT on the plane as possible. Pushing past people to board first is unnecessary and rude.", "NTA. He could have boarded on time with his group but for whatever reason did not. Unless he's going to fight people in the jet bridge too, scanning in earlier does literally nothing to help him find bin space.\n\nAlso:\n\n> breathing stale air\n\nThe air on board is replaced every 2-3 minutes depending on the type of plane. From a COVID standpoint you're far safer on an airborne plane than you are in the terminal.", "NTA and I hate these entitled people", "NTA", "NTA, you're allowed to tell someone that they're not allowed to cut you in line, especially when letting them cut you could negatively affect you. Whether he chose to be late or was made late by other circumstances, he needed to behave like an adult and wait in line", "I mean NTA in general, you snooze you lose and it really doesn\u2019t matter that much. but I will say, aside from the specifically priority boarding or the boarding order for people that need more time or pay extra or yada yada, The last few groups for planes are kind of done from front to back, inside to out. It\u2019s not as random as people think. \nEver notice that if you have a window seat you probably board before your counterpart on the aisle? They do try to make it as seamless as they can with the flight boarding. The need for \u201cpriority\u201d boarding and superiority has made people think it\u2019s all based on status but they really do try to make it as straightforward as possible. \nSo, YOU weren\u2019t inconvenienced but someone probably had to let that guy climb over them to get to their seat. Again, would like to say 100% NTA, that guy was entitled AF and tbh, not your problem at all. but just throwing this out there because I feel like a lot of people don\u2019t realize this about plane boarding.", "NTA\n\nAs someone with flight attendant parents, if they call \u2018now boarding groups 1-6\u2019 then anyone from those groups can go. It really doesn\u2019t matter the order. The only thought I could think is if you were flying Southwest (who doesn\u2019t have assigned seating) he could be more pushy to get a better seat.", "Nta!", "there is assigned seats who cares who gets on first i always try to board last sitting on a plane for 20 or so mins while people walk past you endlessly ... nah not me", "YTA because you don\u2019t understand how boarding zones work. Yes the first couple are \u201cpriority\u201d boarding, but after that it\u2019s about smoothly getting people onto the plane. That means window seats tend to be in an earlier zone than middle seats, which tend to be in an earlier zone than aisle seats. A zone 5 ticket is going to be the same quality of ticket as zone 6. All you did was slow down boarding. \n\nYou are all going to the same plane, and all going to leave at the same time. What did you win exactly by stopping him?", "Well on some airlines certain boarding groups do get to go ahead and get in a different line. Like, for example, on American groups 1-4 can cut the line at any time, but not sure what airline you were on.", "NTA for not letting him cut, but get over yourself about the masks.", "Exactly. \"Now boarding 1-6\" means everyone boards at once. No priority.", "Last flight I took was full. The last people on the plane had to gate check their carryons. Could be something like that.\n\nTotally NTA. Flying sucks.", "This is American, but he was group 5, so not priority per my understanding. Although I did not know that - good to know.", "he shouldve boarded when they called his group then", "Eh, sometimes they have a priority boarding lane or something for first class or passengers so they can skip the line whenever they choose to board.\n\nBut obviously doesn't apply here with mister group five. NTA, OP!", "This happened here too!", "NTA. If you don\u2019t go up when called, you don\u2019t get to push past later. The only exception is when there\u2019s a dedicated lane for business or first class, and even then the gate agents will often open it up to everyone late in the boarding process.", "If you have the kind of priority that lets you skip the line, like flying business or having high status, there is a separate line for you. There's no priority that lets you just push to the front of a line, precisely because this kind of situation could come up. If he didn't have a right to be in the better line, he didn't have the right to go in front of anyone once boarding groups after his were called.\n\nI fly a lot for work so I always have priority, and there has never been a situation where I had to push past anyone. Occasionally there are smaller airports in developing countries that don't do the separate priority lines, and if I'm late to those I just wait like a normal person \u2013 unless it's a country where pushing to the front is the norm and everyone is doing it.", "NTA, and apart from business class/frequent flyers, boarding groups are about often about boarding in the most efficient way, if he pushes past later he disrupts that.\n\nPersonally I usually check my bags and only bring what can be stored under the seat in front of me (or have no problem with them checking my bag at the gate), then I wait and board the plane last, so much less stress!", "But it is *Preferred* boarding, which is literally sold in order to give ticketholders in Group 5 the right to board ahead of General boarding. I fly with AA enough that it\u2019s a moot point for me now but I\u2019ve seen late arrivals in Group 5 get ushered through the Priority lane by gate agents on multiple occasions because, once General boarding starts, they have \u201cpriority\u201d over them. OP was wrong but that\u2019s forgivable because it doesn\u2019t sound like either of the people in this scenario understood AA\u2019s policy on this.", "Oh, it was American? Sorry, friend, that means you were in the wrong. Group 5 on American is *Preferred* boarding, which isn\u2019t Priority but means the person did indeed have a right to board ahead of General boarding. He should have explained, however, that he paid to upgrade his boarding status to Preferred or gone around the line and spoken directly to the gate agent rather than pushing through.", "Group 5 certainly wouldn't be part of the fancy priority lane regardless lol", "Group 5 on American is Preferred boarding. People in that group have literally paid to board ahead of General. If the other guy in this situation had gone to the gate agent instead of pushing through the line, he would\u2019ve been ushered through the Priority lane at that stage of boarding because he technically had \u201cpriority\u201d over everyone in Groups 6-9. \n\nSource: Currently a Platinum award member on AA but have seen this exact scenario play out multiple times over the years. AA Groups 1-4 = priority \u2014 Group 5 = preferred \u2014 Groups 6-9 = general.", "NTA but I swear the airlines get a kick making our flights more hellish so they can make more $$$", "NTA not sure how boarding works where you are but aren\u2019t all seats assigned anyway so what\u2019s the rush?", "Sure, but we have no idea why he didn\u2019t. What we do know is that everyone other than OP in the line understands how plane boarding works, which is why they let him ahead of them.", "No, it\u2019s not her job to figure out their policies. He could\u2019ve gone to a gate agent and if they ushered him through a specific line, so be it, and of course he could\u2019ve gone when 5 was called. He can\u2019t just be pushing past in the normal line himself expecting people to determine the airline\u2019s policy on his ticket. She wasn\u2019t in the wrong because a gate agent or flight attendant had not requested she let him through. It doesn\u2019t really matter if they would have, as you said he didn\u2019t go to them. Heck, for all I know he wasn\u2019t really group 5. If you\u2019re right and they would\u2019ve gotten him ahead, why didn\u2019t he go to the gate agent?", "NTA he better watch that elbow if I\u2019m flying. We\u2019ll both find ourself on the no fly list.", "NTA. We all get upset in these conditions. Now you are sat down and composed you are over it and he will be too. Enjoy your flight \ud83d\ude0a", "I also fly with AA quite often and I only fly First Class (Group 1 boarding). However, if I am not at the gate when they call Group 1, I don't push my way thru the general line once I arrive when they are already boarding other groups. IF the priority lane was open, he needed to stand there (or go to the agent at the gate desk to show he was in Group 5 and they could escort him to the front of the line). It sounds like it wasn't, so he should've stood in line and waited his turn to board.", "Well he should have done that instead of elbowing people in the general boarding lane. Elbowing people to cut through a line makes him an asshole regardless."]}
