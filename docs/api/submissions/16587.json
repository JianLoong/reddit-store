He can't come over to play it, though, and he can't have it immediately in his own home. When he is leaving his items at your house, he is making the choice to go without them/\"ground\" himself from them (like a teenager!). \n\nYou make statements and deadlines. You set consequences if the deadlines aren't met. The first deadline is \"When you leave, X items need to go with you,\" and the second deadline is \"Here is when you can expect your items back if you leave them.\" When he inevitably ignores you and then cajoles you because he made the choice to let his stuff stay there \"I understand you really want to play your PS4, however, I am unable to have company right now.

He\u2019s already moving you out of YOUR place!!", "Your right, I am a random redditor who got above 1k votes, but i am still happy and an award", "Yes, please update us! My heart aches for you\u2014your parents are clearly enabling your brother and messing up your successful life in the process. Know that you deserve everything you have and no one can make you give it up.", "I don\u2019t know if this will work on a front door of a home, but they make a portable door lock like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Additional-Unauthorized-Traveling-Apartment/dp/B082WQR3YM/ref=asc_df_B082WQR3YM/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=416671023321&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3382171824799183141&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033498&hvtargid=pla-870614969719&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=90730998621&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=416671023321&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3382171824799183141&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033498&hvtargid=pla-870614969719) which is intended to make you feel safe while traveling. It may be a helpful stopgap measure to lock your brother out while you are home to help keep him away until new locks can be placed", "And it hasn't worked, so now you have to be the adult and make a choice, then act on your choice. If choice is to keep your apartment and reclaim your space, then you need to remove your brother's clothes from your closet, pack up his gaming system, and tell him that these items go home with him, NOW. And if you are willing to let him stay in your apartment occasionally, you need to put a strict limit on how many nights he is allowed to stay and stick to it. Any \"attitude\" from him OR your parents means that he doesn't stay with you at all, no matter how convenient to work your apartment is. And if your parents are so insistent that he have an apartment similar to yours then they can help him find one and help him pay for it if necessary.\n\nYour NTA, although you're close to becoming one to yourself by allowing yourself to be bullied by your family. And you're not his mother, so stop allowing him to treat you that way. BTW, good sisters help their siblings grow into independent adults. Your brother is behaving like a dependent child.", "Being a good sister means enabling him to stand on his own two feet and take responsibility for his own housing. The man is over 30! Please, stop facilitating his mooching (and your parents' transferring his mooching on to you). Spine, OP. Take control of your life, and his stuff back to the 'rents!  Good luck!", "If talking isn\u2019t working, then stop talking. Pack up his stuff and put it in the corner and tell him to take it out or you will do it for him. This is YOUR home and YOUR rules. And if he does not like your rules, then all the more reason for him to gtfo.", "So why isn't he being a good brother and not try to steal your apartment?", "Tell him to be a good brother and get out of YOUR apartment. Change the locks or add another and take ALL his stuff to your parents. Send him an email that he is no longer welcome to visit at your apartment and if he shows up, you will call the police and have hi charged with trespassing.. And cc: your parents. Don't back down cause it sounds like he is/was the golden child.", "Nah f that. Girl throw his stuff outside then and change the lock. He fucking 32 old still living at home with a shitty job and now wants you to be mommy.", "> Ok, you need to stop trying to discuss this with him, and lay down some boundaries\n\nThat's an essential point.  Too many people from domineering families get in this trap where they feel like the \"adult\" solution requires them to convince their family, to win the argument.  \n\nIt doesn't work that way.  You don't need to convince them (and often can't, because they're not arguing in good faith). Just tell them how it's going to be and then enforce it.", "This. OP, I know you are new to adulting and don't realize it yet - Your family has no interest in supporting you and every interest in supporting your brother. They want to support him either directly (let him continue to live at home and sporadically pay rent), or indirectly (encourage/allow him to perform a slow, but hostile, takeover of someone else's living space so they get theirs back).\n\nIf your parents want to make the choice to support your brother over you, you need to make the choice to be independent enough from them that you don't have to be involved in their choice. \"Oh, bro is still struggling to find a place? That sucks. I got a new plant!\"", "Some leases will even stipulate how long guests can stay for.  OP ... ABSOLUTELY do not hand over your apartment.  Your brother does not seem very responsible and you'd be held liable for any issues he creates there!", "How\u2019s that working out for you \ud83d\ude2c", "And how that go for you?"]}
