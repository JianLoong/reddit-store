If you're happy with what you have, don't let your family push you into changing it.\n\nYour brother needs to stand on his own two feet.\n\nI'd also probably recommend that you stop letting him stay, he seems to be taking you for a complete mug.", "NTA. AT ALL. He can find his own bedsitter/one-bedroom apartment with a cheap rent, just like you did. He's older than you and he acts like a child. As for your parents, they're enabling him. It doesn't sound like they're contributing anything to your life.\n\nIn your shoes, I'd pack up the PS4 and send it to your parents' house along with all his other stuff, change the locks and deny him entry to your apartment. And I'd tell the parents that I'd go NC with them if they so much as make a peep about their golden child or their opinions about him poaching someone else's apartment.", "NTA", "NTA wtffff this is YOUR place he doesn\u2019t get to just take it over and push you out no matter who he is wtf is wrong with your parents?!! Change the locks and leave his stuff outside the door.", "NTA, kick his ass out of your home, your brother is a parasite.", "Oh god. Change the locks and drive his stuff back to your parents. Your parents are doing this bc they have no spine to make him move out. \n\nHold your ground and kick your brother out.", "And how to do this? Start with telling him to stop shifting himeself in. That it is your place.\n\nIf that falls on deaf ears, see if you can change the locks while he is out, then don't give him or your parents a key.\n\nThen box up his stuff and take it back to your parents.", "Haha the parents don't want him back at home!!", "The parents want him the heck out and just don\u2019t want to risk their relationship doing it! \n\nThey want OP to do all the work. LOL \n\nNTA.", "Sounds like the parents are fed up with him and want him out as well.", "This, 100%. NTA", "Idk where OP's from but this is very common in some cultures. The son is everything and the daughter well..meh. OP, NTA. Please don't let them manipulate you!", "Came here to say the same. It seems like OP's parents have a favorite child and OP is used to accommodating her brother.", "I'm sure their parents are just desperate to get him out permanently, now that they've had a whiff of freedom. He's probably just happy taking over his sister's home without actually having to pay for it or being responsible. I suggest OP changes the internet password, that seems to work on many teens...", "Both", "\u2206 THIS! Please remove him Now!\n\nNTA", "Squatters rights is like 10 years lol.", "I agreed with everything you said. This is a very dangerous situation for OP, she seems young and unsure of herself, and her family is trying to take advantage of her. She has to go LC and find a therapist to help her to set boundaries. She doesn't need the kind of family who takes advantage of her.", "To be more precise: Im trying to say that your brother is the one who should have to take responsibility for his behavior and it's ok to talk to him and ask this of him directly. Laying down boundaries with your brother will be beneficial to you, and perhaps your relationship to your brother and parents, long term.\nI wish for you that you are able to find a way to make this work!", "They probably already do but they don\u2019t live near his job like OP does. OP could ask the parents to get a house closer to his job :-)", "Btw if this does not work, the nuclear option would be for OP to indeed find a new place, move out and cancel the lease. Let leech bro be evicted.", "OP should bring all her brother's belongings to her parents house (and change the lock if he has a key) and let them deal with it. If they're so worried about their struggling son, they can deal with him.", "I have a suggestion, ask your brother what is on his mind and his wants maybe he doesn\u2019t want your apt or any apt that doesn\u2019t. One with a made if so send him back to mommy.", "I wouldn't either. He sounds like a treat.\n\nGolden boy here is 32. He should have been weaned off the titty a long time ago. It's time for him to be released into the wild and sink or swim on his own. If his parents consider being a grown up too big of a task for him then they should be the ones who continue to wipe his ass, not op. The fact that their 23 year old daughter has a higher paying job and is a well functioning member of society doesn't even factor in. I believe Mark Zuckerberg also has a higher paid job than the enlightened son over here, but that's also irrelevant.", "My first thought too. \ud83d\ude06", "Kind of stupid of them if that is the case, because they risk their relationship with op. If they are okay with that, then it looks like brother is the golden child.\nStill, my vote is NTA. OP needs to move the brother out, he's not paying to live there. Inform the landlord, change the locks, box up all his shit, let him and the parents figure out another place for him to live", "I'm afraid it's a long-occuring problem. Otherwise I don't think op would be in such doubt as to what's okay for her to do.\n\nI'm sure they're desperate to get him out, but I bet they've enabled his weaponised incompetence for a looooong time.", "Squatters rights depends on your state of residence so\u2026\ud83d\ude2c", "My brain almost shut down when reading that THAT was the parents' take on the whole situation. \"Oh just let your bro steal your home lol, what's the big deal?\"", "I'm furious on OP's behalf.", "Why not just be straight with him? He overstayed his welcome so he is no longer welcome, seems easy and clear to me", "She could also just add another lock from the inside, i seen other contraptions people can slide into their door to keep it from being opened, i just cant remember what it\u2019s called", "Absolutely, if OP is willing to go no contact that's what I'd suggest as well. But I know it's rare for people to be willing to jump straight to no contact.\n\nConsidering how poorly this singular situation reflects on the parents, I'm sure there's a lot more nonsense going on in this family.", "Do you have friends who could help you when you ask him to leave? I\u2019m honestly not thinking of being deliberately confrontational, but if you pack his stuff and let him know that it\u2019s time to go home then he\u2019ll try to manipulate you so having a couple of other people there could help change that dynamic. They could help him shift his belongings, too.\nNTA obviously", "I didn't see that part(thanks for mentioning this lol), thus them wanting brother OUT OF THERE lol.  They can't get the mooch to GROW or GO, but hey other child YOU take care of the failure to launch OLDER adult.  Not happening.", "Oooo, i like that\ud83d\ude08", "This actually needs to be top comment so that OP sees it and follows through!!", "This is the way", "Agreed. Maybe OP should tell her their parents to let bro steal their place and they can find a new place to live.\n\nNTA, you need to change the locks asap, then take all his $hit back to your parents place.", "We have different diets so he doesn't want to eat what I eat (I'm vegan) and buys takeout for himself when he stays but he doesn't grocery shop or anything. Given I've never asked that of him.", "Just wanna know, what does opie mean?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone, opie=op.", "Kick him ouuuut, OP. He is a grown man who is mooching off of you, even if he isn't eating your food.\nYour parents can take their son back. He's not your responsibility.", "Get. Him. Out. Now. \n\nOP, you deserve better than a leech of a brother and a couples of snakes for parents.", "You need to kick him out change the locks take all of his stuff back to his parents.\n\nIf that doesn't work a nuclear option or options\n\n1.) Cancel the lease move out when he's not their. Let him deal with the problem now that you are gone. Move out and move as far away as possible and do not tell your family where you are going.\n\n2.) Not sure if this will work someone who is more knowledgeable can answer this. Call the cops have him removed, get a restraining order against him.\n\n3.) Unforunately I think you will have to move and if you do again move as far away as possible. I'd move to another city/town as far away as possible and do not tell anyone. Cancel your lease let the fallout happen to your brother.", "OP = 'Original Poster', but I see 'opie' in comments a lot and suspect that these comments are created using a speech-to-text app", "It means OP or original poster", "OP (original poster) but just in a cute way", "It's supposed to be OP as in Original Poster", "Original Poster i.e. the author of the post, this person is just spelling out OP like Opie", "I think you mean \u201cOP\u201d which means \u201cOriginal Poster\u201d", "OP OPIE", "Thanks\n\nOPIE was in all caps so my first thought was \"Original Poster Internet Explorer\" lol", "PEN PINAPPLE APPLE PEN"]}
