There's some sort of conditional review going on here, and there shouldn't be. Just because the guest is an AH doesn't make the OP less of an AH to treat the guest's needs as less than the dogs'.", "I assume that it was a warning, more than a request.

After all, you've granted them the hospitality of providing them a meal, so they have no right to complain.", "Quite frankly I don't trust OP to be objective about that, given her clear dislike of Bob in the rest of the post.", "I have slept on a few that deflate throughout the night and doubt op laid on the mattress to see if it deflated and even if she did doubt she weighs as much as the guest. \u201cGuest\u201d is used liberally here as OP doesn\u2019t give a shit about him", "Cause out of the 12+ ppl I've ever let stay with me cause of 'issues' only 1 left on their own.

Without them on there we can literally reach out and not be able to touch the other person, we are both quite small, but the bed never seemed smaller than when our babies were both in it. Of course it was more important that they slept so rather than waking them up I would spend half the night taking pictures of how adorable they looked before gently manoeuvring myself into any space I could rather than disturbing them. I don\u2019t know if I will ever sleep as well without dogs for the rest of my life. \nAnd you are NTA, nothing wrong with an air mattress and if he sleeps on the sofa bed he has to share with the dogs\u2026.although I admit I would be asking to do that if I was staying anyway but just for the cuddles.", "Inviting someone over is different than allowing someone to crash", "Then why even bother commenting if you can't trust anything she says and all you can do is assume things?", "Well, I'm sorry your family/friends suck, but that doesn't mean that happens to everyone", "I believe that things happened generally as OP explained them, I don't trust that that particular detail was accurate.
