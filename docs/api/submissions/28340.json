Hell, even 25 and 19 are bad already, let alone 39. A 39-year-old man is a grown-ass adult with a 401k, whereas a 19-year-old is old literally just graduated HS.

The liklihood of him fulfilling those requirements is not great given that he is 38 and working as a cook.\n\nIf you can get her to agree to delay, alot can and will happen over the next few years that will open her eyes to the absurdity of the situation.

When he speaks poorly to her, ask \"does he talk to you like that often? Does he apologize?\". Tell her you read that when couples attend pre marital counseling they are more likely to have a long-lasting relationship, and ask if they've thought about it.

That it was a knee-jerk reaction based only on his age, and that you realize that's not fair, and that you should get to know him and them together as a couple before you form an opinion.

This is a bad idea and is really predatory here.    Your sister could do better and I hope she realizes it.", "YTA. You should have never shouted or called her relationship \"disgusting\". Apologize sincerely and then have an honest and calm conversation with her. Try to make her think about the future of this relationship. Their age gap is huge and she needs to take that into account.

You really did your sister a disservice with that reaction.  I'm disappointed that you chose to blame her for being in this relationship.  Yes, it doesn't seem like a smart choice, but a 39 year old wields so much power over a 19 year old.  You just pushed her way closer to him by doing this.

So *if* this does implode, whenever that may be, don't pull any \"Toldja so\" stuff, just be there for her.

None of us know which this is, and I don't think you do, either after only meeting him once. \n\nWe're all allowed to have our own opinions. Personally, even if the guy was her age, I don't think anyone younger than 25 should get married. They don't know who they are, their frontal lobes aren't developed, and most people I know who got married that young either hates their marriage or are divorced. But still, that comes back to making decisions and living with consequences (if there are any). And my personal opinion isn't going to keep <25-year-olds from getting married and I would exhaust myself trying to convince everyone my *opinion* is \"right\".
