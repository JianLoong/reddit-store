The night before, I got horrendous food poisoning and called him that day to let him know I was very sick and couldn\u2019t come home. His initial concern turned to irritation pretty quick and he started accusing me of lying because I wanted to meet other guys. He also told me this was the third time I had cancelled our plans (which is true, I\u2019ve had to reschedule twice due to my crazy work schedule). The conversation was upsetting me and I was so weak so I told him I was going to hang up. He instantly flipped the conversation, telling me he was just worried and then said he was going to drive up to come pick me up and bring me home, saying over and over \u201cI just want you safe with me\u201d. I firmly told him that he was not to come, that I was too sick to sit in a car and was going to stay another night and try to sleep it off, then hung up the phone.

Let\u2019s list out a few things, any one of which should be a deal breaker:\n\nHe accused you of wanting to meet other guys because you were sick. \n\nHe went from accusing to faux concern when you were going to hang up, making it seem like you\u2019d be unreasonable to do so. \n\nHe ignored your express wishes and drove there. \n\nHe made it seem like it was all your fault. \n\nSo we have unreasonable jealousy, manipulative behaviors, extreme control measures, and gaslighting. RUN.", "**NTA**\n\nHe has multiple times COMPLETELY DISREGARDED YOUR CLEARLY STATED BOUNDARIES. And in this instance he did it when you were vulnerable; in fact, he used your vulnerability to his advantage. He calls it \"wanting to take care of you\" but you're an adult and had told him very specifically that you didn't want to be \"taken care of\" and in fact didn't want his company at all. \n\nMost importantly, and I say this from the perspective of someone who has been in abusive relationships, he said something really specific that sent up a red flag for me: his repeated comment about \"I just want you safe with me\".\n\nThere was literally no reason to believe that you were IN ANY WAY \"UNSAFE\". But his repeating that phrase over and over, that he felt that you should be with him to be \"safe\" was a MASSIVE RED FLAG. Coupled with his unwillingness to hear or acknowledge your stated boundaries, he is telling you that he feels that he - and only he - should be \"responsible for your safety and well-being\", to the point of removing you from a situation where you are actually comfortable, and forcing you into a situation you don't want, and where he can make you be more dependent on him while you are ill. He is equating your \"safety\" with his presence . . . and that's a tactic that abusers use to justify isolating their victims.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA, but I'm genuinely concerned for you. Pushing you into an intense, committed relationship earlier than you're ready; pushing for more closeness than you want at a time when you are physically vulnerable; ignoring your boundaries . . . this man is showing all the signs of a potential abuser, and he is escalating. I suggest that you end this relationship sooner rather than later.", "NTA. There are more red flags here than at a Soviet parade.", "Always, Always, ALWAYS listen to your \"Gut!\"\n\nHe IS controlling!  He HAS crossed boundaries!\n\nPlease block him and cease all contact.

It was creepy and controlling! \n\nHoly cow lady, is he going to have to full on go \"Misery\" on you before you realize that he wants to totally control and own you? There is NOTHING OK about this man's behavior! He's not just \"a bit\" controlling. \n\nI also have to wonder what your base level for a relationship is if you think this guy is only \"a bit\" controlling. Because...yikes. I honestly think his driving there after you asked him not to, plus his other behaviors, might warrant a restraining order.", "He is not being sweet.

You told him not to come. You said you were going to stay an extra night. He made decisions for you without consulting you. Pretty presumptuous when you've only been seeing him for 4 months. For me, this would be break up worthy.", "NTA. Even his kindness sounds controlling. Like, the intent isn't *actually* sweet at all; he's trying to manipulate you into forgiving him and spending time with him.

He goes from accusations and anger to pretending he's concerned. This is a huge control move.

If this is the honeymoon period where he's on his best behaviour, how will he act when he thinks he's got you all tied up?
