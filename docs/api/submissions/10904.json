The conversation was upsetting me and I was so weak so I told him I was going to hang up.

Let\u2019s list out a few things, any one of which should be a deal breaker:\n\nHe accused you of wanting to meet other guys because you were sick. \n\nHe went from accusing to faux concern when you were going to hang up, making it seem like you\u2019d be unreasonable to do so. \n\nHe ignored your express wishes and drove there. \n\nHe made it seem like it was all your fault. \n\nSo we have unreasonable jealousy, manipulative behaviors, extreme control measures, and gaslighting. RUN.", "**NTA**\n\nHe has multiple times COMPLETELY DISREGARDED YOUR CLEARLY STATED BOUNDARIES. And in this instance he did it when you were vulnerable; in fact, he used your vulnerability to his advantage. He calls it \"wanting to take care of you\" but you're an adult and had told him very specifically that you didn't want to be \"taken care of\" and in fact didn't want his company at all. \n\nMost importantly, and I say this from the perspective of someone who has been in abusive relationships, he said something really specific that sent up a red flag for me: his repeated comment about \"I just want you safe with me\".\n\nThere was literally no reason to believe that you were IN ANY WAY \"UNSAFE\". But his repeating that phrase over and over, that he felt that you should be with him to be \"safe\" was a MASSIVE RED FLAG. Coupled with his unwillingness to hear or acknowledge your stated boundaries, he is telling you that he feels that he - and only he - should be \"responsible for your safety and well-being\", to the point of removing you from a situation where you are actually comfortable, and forcing you into a situation you don't want, and where he can make you be more dependent on him while you are ill. He is equating your \"safety\" with his presence . . . and that's a tactic that abusers use to justify isolating their victims.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA, but I'm genuinely concerned for you. Pushing you into an intense, committed relationship earlier than you're ready; pushing for more closeness than you want at a time when you are physically vulnerable; ignoring your boundaries . . . this man is showing all the signs of a potential abuser, and he is escalating.

There is NOTHING OK about this man's behavior! He's not just \"a bit\" controlling. \n\nI also have to wonder what your base level for a relationship is if you think this guy is only \"a bit\" controlling. Because...yikes.

I'd watch out for this guy, seriously.", "***RUN***", "The really telling part for me is that he wanted a commitment right away even though you were not ready. On top of all of this is the total disrespect and controlling behavior over you being sick. NTA and as others have said run!", "Wow, NTA, thats a... lot of red flags!  I find that kind of obsession unsettling, and the flip-flopping is also concerning.\n\nThis was not a sweet gesture.  Trust your gut.", "NTA! This guy is scary!", "NTA - he didn\u2019t respect your wishes. He doesn\u2019t respect you. Make sure your boundaries are in place and don\u2019t budge. \n\nI would really pay attention to his behaviour and never give an inch. If he doesn\u2019t like that you\u2019re being you and not changing your life to revolve around him - he needs to go.", "NTA.  Run, do not walk away from this relationship as fast as you can.  His controlling behavior will only get worse", "NTA. He sounds like a crazy stalker", "NTA This is not sweet.  He is disregarding what you need for what he wants.  He is not respecting your autonomy.", "NTA Take this as a sign to end this relationship, that is crazy controlling.

Be glad you\u2019ve only sunk 4 months into this guy. It only gets worse. Break up, block, go completely NC. Be prepared to have a stalker for awhile until he finds a new victim so please take safety precautions.", "His intent was not sweet.

Hope you feel better soon. Let me know if you need anything then left you alone to recover. Get rid of this clown.", "Keep you safe from what? Were you in the middle of a forest surrounded by a pack of wolves? You were safe enough. \n\nAs he was coming there, waving his big red flag, your attitude was a clear \"this bs doesn't work with me\"\n\nI don't know if he was cheated in the past but his insecurities and out-of-line behavior are not your problems.", "NTA. You told him not to come, he ignored that. On top of that, he accused you of lying to him about being sick, with no reason. Best to end it.", "NTA.\n\nBlock this guy and move on.  He\u2019s got some boundary issues and jealousy issues and control issues.  Better to just nip this relationship in the bud.", "NTA. Are you blind?

He'll love you right to death if you allow him.", "Throw this one back in the sea. He is not the one for you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \nThis is a tour of the red flag factory. Run!", "NTA. And break up with this guy. He wasn\u2019t driving to see you because he cared about you. He was driving because he suspected that the vacation was actually a romantic rendezvous and you were lying about being sick. He was desperate to see the situation for himself because of his jealousy and insecurity. \u2018Keeping you safe\u2019 was a cover for \u2018catching you in the act.\u2019 \n\nThink logically - you\u2019re a healthy adult. Healthy adults can usually get through food poisoning with some rest and fluids. You were with a Doctor!! You were much better off resting, having fluids, not being car sick, and being monitored by an actual Doctor. You told him this. He didn\u2019t listen because\u2026 he wasn\u2019t motivated by your health. \n\nIt\u2019s been 4 months. Be glad he showed his manipulative, jealous, controlling side so early. Move on.", "GET OUT NOW!!!!\n\nNTA", "I think you overreacted.", ">this man is showing all the signs of a potential abuser\n\nYUP. Both times men have *insisted* on showing up somewhere even though I clearly said I didn't want them to, they were awful in many other ways. One turned out to be verbally abusive (and probably would've escalated to physical abuse if I'd stuck around long enough). The other was unbelievably manipulative (he insisted on driving several hundred miles to \"help\" when I told him my sister died, and then used my vulnerable state to force physical \"affection\" under the guise of comfort, *then* told me he was in love with me and that we should be together).\n\nAt this point, if a dude overrides me saying, \"no, don't come here,\" I'm out. I don't care what the excuse is, at best it says he doesn't respect me when I say no.", "Forget red flags,  this is a big ass flashing billboard.", "Yup, marinara flags galore! Run!", "Exactly!!!! Check out \u2018Obsessed\u2019 on Hulu. They almost all start out just like this. Gives me the creeps.", "My first red flag was where you said you didn't want anything serious so you agreed to be exclusive...which to me is serious.", "Context is very, very important! Nuance. So the short answer is no, if you're listening to and respecting your partner it's not at all a bad thing to say.\n\n\"I just want to make sure you're safe.\" when you're asking for just information, especially from an established partner, isn't a problem. If the answer, \"Yes, I'm somewhere safe and I'm unharmed.\" is enough, then it really is just checking up on them. It's sweet.\n\nIn this guy's case, he is *not* an established partner and his behavior has already felt \"controlling\".\n\nAnd her answer of, \"Yes, I'm safe.\" was met basically with *\"No you're not, not until I say you are, I am moving you to a location* I *approve of*.\" \n\nWhen she did not want to be moved, when she *said* she didn't want to be moved. It wasn't the words or concern that was the issue; it was overstepping boundaries and controlling, in the *disguise* of concern. The difference is in how you react to their answer, and if they have input in how they are safe/taken care of.\n\nEven offering to bring her home wouldn't be bad! It was the driving anyway after she refused, and the *anger* at her refusing that is gross. No one is angry at a refusal of a gift unless they had intentions attached to it, ya know?", "This sounds like a very different situation than what happened with OP. If you're worried that someone is sick, or haven't heard from them when you expected to, and they haven't asked you not to contact them or anything, then it's perfectly fine to say \"I just want to make sure you're safe.\" \n\nOP's boyfriend said \"I just want to make sure you're safe *with me*.\" But he knew where she was, that she was safe with friends, and that she had food poisoning, and she was communicating with him (until he massively violated her boundaries). He did know she was safe, which shows that it wasn't about her safety-- it was about her being with him, and about controlling her. That's the red flag-- he already did know she was safe.", "Totally different. My husband and I check in with each other to make sure we are safe. But when he or I say \u201cim safe\u201d it\u2019s respected. Not \u201cim coming there because I don\u2019t respect your answer and only I get to decide if you\u2019re safe\u201d. And we all know it was a front to drive there and make sure she wasn\u2019t lying because he already decided she was staying to hook up with men.", "It\u2019s also different if you\u2019ve been in a relationship for a long time and trust each other. If one of you says, \u201cI want to make sure you\u2019re safe\u201d. And the other says, \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d. And you both leave it at that that\u2019s a normal interaction. The boundary crossing when she said I\u2019m fine and he drove 3 hrs to get her is where this is creepy behavior.", "Not that well if he shows his card only 4 months in. They usually keep up the mask longer to ensure an emotional investment from their prey.", "Came here to find this comment.  Haha", "I\u2019m worried about you OP. You stated clearly he was not to come and he trampled that boundary. End it and do it safely. Maybe in a public place with a friend to drive home with in case he follows you. Or text/call him from not your home (if you have pets bring them with you too). I\u2019m concerned he\u2019s going to come to your house \u201cjust to talk\u201d and even if he isn\u2019t physical I can\u2019t imagine that will be a safe conversation. \n\nAlso after this blows over talk to your friend who said it wasn\u2019t a big deal. This was a huge warning sign and she may be going through something similar or she may just need a little education.", "Good that he doesn't then.", "Yes, I haven't seen any mariana flags for a while, I miss them", "Oh absolutely. I hope he doesn\u2019t learn from this either.", "Yeah God forbid you should try to clarify if you first say \"that's sweet of you, I really appreciate it\" followed by \"but it's not necessary and here's why\" and then ignore him when he drives there. Especially because women more broadly are totally known for never sending mixed messages or for never wanting some big romantic gestures and expecting the guy to read between all kinds of lines...\n\nAs I said, his behavior raises red flags for me as well, which is why I first said to break up with him sooner rather than later, but then caveated it by asking what the precise message was and it simply wasn't as straightforward as it appeared. That doesn't quite make the red flags go away, though the jealous fit is much more problematic as are the many calls and texts imo. But if she gives a shit, then of course it matters what he feels - if she can then live with his feelings and resulting behavior is an entirely different question. If she doesn't care about him, then sure, she can block and never talk to him again."]}
