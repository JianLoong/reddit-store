Sometimes I feel like my temples are squeezed in a vice and slowly squeezed, I think very slowly and move around, staggering like a drunk. Painkillers rarely help me, but the pain can bring me to tears and sometimes lasts literally for DAYS. I don't want to dwell on this topic for a long time, so I'll just say that I'm undergoing examinations.\n\nSo, the main conflict began on New Year's Eve. In my country, Christmas is not particularly celebrated, December 31 is the main holiday. This year I celebrated it for the first time without my family: my girlfriend and I went on a trip. My mom (F40) and I were separated by a time zone, and her year 2024 came a little earlier than mine.\n\nMom was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which has always made her a little overprotective. A few hours before the new year came, I went to sleep for a while. At this very time, mom had already moved on to 2024 and wrote me a message congratulating me.\n\nI didn't reply to this message for about 20 minutes. Mom was worried that something had happened to me, wrote me a million more messages, and finally called. The phone screamed in my ear. If I am woken up ahead of time, it will absolutely provoke a migraine attack, and my whole family knows about it. I woke up and convinced mom that everything was fine. I spent the rest of the holiday with a hellish migraine.\n\nThe next day, late at night, when I went to bed, mom texted me and said that she had checked the weather forecast in the city where we are, and she was worried that it was too cold here. Again, I didn't see this message because I was already asleep. Again, mom wrote about twenty messages to me and a few more to my girlfriend, and then she started attacking our phones with calls, because she decided that we froze to death.\n\nFinally, today she started calling me at seven-thirty in the morning because I hadn't answered her cat's picture for about an hour. I woke up already feeling like some dwarf had planted explosives in my head. Even now I can literally feel my head throbbing and I'm sick of migraines. I wrote my mom a polite, but passive-aggressive message, where I reminded her that I had asked her a million times not to call me at night or early in the morning because it physically hurts me, that I am an adult and can live for several hours without her control, and that, finally, now I will just turn off my phone at night and reply to her messages when it is convenient for me, and not at any time of the day, as it was before.\n\nShe texted me (I quote): \"I'm sorry, I won't write to you anymore\" and stopped responding to my messages. My brother says that she is offended by me, and now it seems to me that I should have been more tolerant of her. She has never behaved so anxiously before, and I think this is due to her tendency to overprotect and the fact that I finally started the separation process.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704202028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wpems/aita_for_i_was_rude_to_my_anxious_mother_because/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother\u2019s entitlement to soothe her unfounded anxiety stops when it gives you massive headaches. NTA", "NTA, your mother needs help.  This is not normal behavior from her.  Also on your headache topic, consider being tested for \"Cluster Headaches\".  My sister called her headaches Migraine for years before she was properly diagnosed, and she now had the right medicine.", "NTA. OP even if your mother has anxiety, this goes beyond anxiety. This is controlling behavior. She wants you on HER time. Its ok to set boundaries. \n\nHonestly, your mom is 100% using the \"i won't message you anymore\" as a guilt tactic. I'd follow through and go low/no-contact and see how long your mother truly lasts before trying to reel you back in. Keep your boundaries, set a Do-Not-Disturb timeframe on your phone for night/mornings. \n\nIf you absolutely feel the need to reply to your mom, do so but keep your bounary firm. Example \"I am not asking you to go no contact with me, however I am asking you be mindful and respect my need for quiet hours from (pm time) to (am time). If you cannot, for the sake of my health respect this request, a temporary period of limited contact may be necessary.\" \n\nHope you get your migraines figured out and on a treatment plan that reduces these triggers for you!", "NTA.

I suggest you set that up and let her know your phone is unreachable during that time. \n\nThat way you won\u2019t be woken up by unwanted calls and messages and your mom will know not to expect any response during that time.", "How do you go about your life if a simple phone call can cause all these problems?

How does this migraine thing affect that?", "NTA", "NTA, Your mom's a slight nutcase.\n\nAdvice - You have issues with being woken up randomly. Keep your phone on DND. Have only ONE contact as DND exception & ask everyone else to contact that one person that too only if it's an emergency.\n\n(Dipping feet in hot water with salt/epsom right when the migraine starts and Smelling eucalyptus oil has helped by brother manage his migraines for decades.

But it still obviously has consequences for OP.", "NTA. Before my MIL died she would call my husband at 7 a.m. every Sunday. Here's the thing, Sunday was the ONLY day he could sleep in and catch up on a bit of rest.\n\nThis was the 1990's, so I started unplugging the phone during Saturday night and then plugging it in again in the morning. Yes, MIL started complaining about hubby not answering the phone and I (with a very wide-eyed, innocent expression) said \"yes I unplug the phone because calls keep waking him up. Hubby needs his sleep.\"\n\nYep, she deeply disliked me, *but* hubby got some sleep.  Funny though, even after he figured out what I was doing, he never mentioned it or was upset about it.\n\nHe adored his mother, but she was intrusive.", "Your mum's anxiety is exactly that.  Hers not yours.  I am also a person who must switch off my phone from 8pm to 8am to avoid all the anxious and depressed people dumping on me.  They refuse therapy yet seem quite happy to absolutely melt my head to the level your head is melted now.\nMy migraines were caused by years of rocking my teeth.  I only found the solution when I woke up with lockjaw one day and went to the dentist.", "NTA.\n\nIt's the responsibility of anxiety sufferers to make sure that our issues don't affect those around us. My grandma had *horrendous* undiagnosed OCD (it was the most obvious OCD in the world so I feel confident saying she had it despite the lack of diagnosis) and yet she still did her best to be kind to others. She did frequently let her anxiety about airplanes spill over onto us, but we found ways to manage that by limiting the information we told her, and she accepted that she wouldn't always hear about things. Even without treatment, she did her damnedest to keep things from spilling over onto others too much. She was deathly afraid of needles, for example, but still said \"thank you\" to every nurse who had to draw blood from her. \n\nI know you didn't want to go into the headaches much, but I am personally a sufferer of headaches that sound a LOT like yours, so if you don't mind, I have some suggestions and ideas that might be relevant or give you some ideas on what things could be:\n\nHave you tried muscle relaxers? I get tension headaches that sound very similar to what you experience, and while painkillers don't work at all for me, muscle relaxers do-- and this is fairly common for tension headaches. At one point I even got IV painkillers when I went to the hospital and they did *nothing,* but muscle relaxers actually worked.  \n\nHowever, the muscle relaxers knock me the heck out for a LONG time, so I ended up getting a medical marijuana authorization and now use that because it's less disabling than the alternative with more pleasant side effects lol. It doesn't work quite as well as the muscle relaxers, but it's worth the slightly lesser effectiveness for the much better side effects. I take it as an oil because I don't want the smell and lung issues of smoking or vaping it. Of course it's not an option everywhere though, and has its own side effects. Some people find that it increases anxiety, and while I have severe anxiety (treated with other medication and therapy) and it doesn't make me more anxious, that's not a guarantee. \n\nThe reason I get the tension headaches is that my neck is not curved as much as it should be, which makes the little muscles at the base of the skull that hold the skull upright go haywire, causing headaches due to the physical strain of it. The headaches are also triggered by changes in barometric pressure, so big changes in the weather tend to get me. They can also be triggered by stress and anxiety.", "She said she is undergoing examinations. I take that to mean she is under medical care for this.", "If you read the post properly it\u2019s not the phone call that caused the issue though that probably didn\u2019t help things it\u2019s the fact that the mom calls in the middle of the night or early in the morning. OP needs proper sleep and to not be woken before their body gets enough sleep or it will trigger a migraine attack.", "I did read the post properly? They\u2019ve claimed to be an adult multiple times but haven\u2019t worked out they can just put their phone on silent? And my question still stands, how are they able to work if a simple phone call or being woken up early can cause all that? how do they function in their normal day to day life?", "She is probably not functioning very well at the moment, which was her whole point. These migraines or cluster headaches) have become very debilitating.\n\nOP did not mention work, so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up since it has nothing to do with the post and the current problem."]}
