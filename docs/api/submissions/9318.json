Myself and one of my closest  friends are attending a wedding in 3 weeks time. It's been in planning  since before Covid, and we wanted to make sure everybody could come  together which is why it's been postponed as long as it has. I'm going  as a guest, but my friend is one of 5 head bridesmaids. The dresses were  picked out specially and have already arrived. It's pertinent to note  that these are strapless dresses (you know, the ones held up primarily  by your boobs) and every one is fine with that. Except for my friend.\n\n2  months ago she received a diagnosis of cancer and had an emergency  double mastectomy and has been going through chemo since. She has always  been a wig wearer anyway so if you hadn't been told you wouldn't know  she had cancer and was going through treatment. Because of the wedding  and also because of her own personal feelings this isn't widely known  information, and she didn't want to inform the bride and groom because  she, in her words not mine, \"\\[doesn't\\] want to take attention away from  the happy couple on their big day by being the token sick one\". My views  on her telling other people about this is irrelevant, it's her body,  her condition, and ultimately it is her information to tell and I am not  in a position to disclose something so sensitive.\n\nNow  here comes the clincher... since the mastectomy once the wounds had  healed over, she bought basically a big padded bra that gives the  impression of having breasts. It's convincing, fairly neutral colour,  but with a strapless dress the top of the bra would be very obvious, and  were she not to wear the pads the dress wouldn't... yknow... have  anything to hold on to. So a bit of a double dilemma. This is where I  come in - I work with fabric a fair amount for my job and can roughly  mimic the embroidery on the dress into two small but functional straps  that would hide the arm holes of the padded bra and stay in line with  the style of the dress. I was the one who recommended this, as my friend  is adamant she doesn't want to ruin the mood of the wedding by telling  people her situation. Neither of us can decide if we should or not -  WIBTA if I sewed straps onto the dress to allow her time to reveal the  diagnosis in her own time? Or would it cause more questions and upset  the bride that I've altered the dress?", "created_utc": 1675715007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vh24k/wibta_if_i_sewed_straps_onto_my_friends/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend doesn't want to insert her health crisis into the bride's happy day. I understand completely.\n\nI think your friend should merely tell the bride that she'd be more comfortable with straps and that you, a professional seamstress, would make them. Some women don't like strapless dresses because they're afraid they'll pop out of the dress. When my daughter got married, her dress was strapless.

I'm not sure if that would work.", "NAH. I understand your friend's hesitancy, but if she's close enough to be a bridesmaid, I would hop she's close enough to tell the bride the truth.

You wouldn't be an AH for helping your friend, but ultimately I think if you do the alteration and the bride doesn't find out until the wedding day then there will be questions and it will \"take away\" from the day no matter what. So I think your friend should definitely let the bride know ahead of time to avoid future strife.\n\nIf the bride is any kind of a friend, she will completely understand the need for the alteration and to be honest, if I had a bridesmaid that felt she couldn't tell me this kind of thing then I'd be heartbroken and devastated.

Being forced or forcing herself into it isn't going to make it better. Everybody needs to just get through this event, and if a white lie is what's required, fine.
