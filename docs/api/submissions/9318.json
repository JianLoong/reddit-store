Myself and one of my closest  friends are attending a wedding in 3 weeks time. It's been in planning  since before Covid, and we wanted to make sure everybody could come  together which is why it's been postponed as long as it has. I'm going  as a guest, but my friend is one of 5 head bridesmaids. The dresses were  picked out specially and have already arrived. It's pertinent to note  that these are strapless dresses (you know, the ones held up primarily  by your boobs) and every one is fine with that. Except for my friend.\n\n2  months ago she received a diagnosis of cancer and had an emergency  double mastectomy and has been going through chemo since. She has always  been a wig wearer anyway so if you hadn't been told you wouldn't know  she had cancer and was going through treatment. Because of the wedding  and also because of her own personal feelings this isn't widely known  information, and she didn't want to inform the bride and groom because  she, in her words not mine, \"\\[doesn't\\] want to take attention away from  the happy couple on their big day by being the token sick one\". My views  on her telling other people about this is irrelevant, it's her body,  her condition, and ultimately it is her information to tell and I am not  in a position to disclose something so sensitive.\n\nNow  here comes the clincher... since the mastectomy once the wounds had  healed over, she bought basically a big padded bra that gives the  impression of having breasts. It's convincing, fairly neutral colour,  but with a strapless dress the top of the bra would be very obvious, and  were she not to wear the pads the dress wouldn't... yknow... have  anything to hold on to. So a bit of a double dilemma. This is where I  come in - I work with fabric a fair amount for my job and can roughly  mimic the embroidery on the dress into two small but functional straps  that would hide the arm holes of the padded bra and stay in line with  the style of the dress. I was the one who recommended this, as my friend  is adamant she doesn't want to ruin the mood of the wedding by telling  people her situation. Neither of us can decide if we should or not -  WIBTA if I sewed straps onto the dress to allow her time to reveal the  diagnosis in her own time? Or would it cause more questions and upset  the bride that I've altered the dress?", "created_utc": 1675715007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vh24k/wibta_if_i_sewed_straps_onto_my_friends/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend doesn't want to insert her health crisis into the bride's happy day. I understand completely.\n\nI think your friend should merely tell the bride that she'd be more comfortable with straps and that you, a professional seamstress, would make them. Some women don't like strapless dresses because they're afraid they'll pop out of the dress. When my daughter got married, her dress was strapless.

I'm not sure if that would work.", "NAH. I understand your friend's hesitancy, but if she's close enough to be a bridesmaid, I would hop she's close enough to tell the bride the truth.

You wouldn't be an AH for helping your friend, but ultimately I think if you do the alteration and the bride doesn't find out until the wedding day then there will be questions and it will \"take away\" from the day no matter what. So I think your friend should definitely let the bride know ahead of time to avoid future strife.\n\nIf the bride is any kind of a friend, she will completely understand the need for the alteration and to be honest, if I had a bridesmaid that felt she couldn't tell me this kind of thing then I'd be heartbroken and devastated.

Also how wide the straps would be.", "If she is close enough to be a bridesmaid, why can\u2019t she ask the bride/ bring this solution to the bride directly?", "Sew the straps, but pin them to the dress. Then send the bride a picture explaining that friend is uncomfortable strapless and would prefer simple straps like this. Hopefully the bride is reasonable and your friend can maintain her privacy.", "Invisible straps could also be an option. They're not completely invisible, but  depending on how low cut the dress is, the invisible straps may look better than straps.\n\nJust make sure you and the bridesmaid clear it with the bride.", "If she is in the US and has health insurance, bras/bra inserts are often considered prosthetics and can be billed to insurance. They do have to be purchased from specific shops with specially trained fitters though. Something for her to look into at least.", "I really think she should talk to the bride, though. Drop the cover story, be open and honest, and do it ahead of the wedding.", "She can tell the bride and just ask the bride to keep it to herself. It's not like the bride is going to hand her a sign to carry that says I altered my bridesmaid dress because I have cancer. Telling the bride isn't telling the whole wedding, there is a big difference.", "totally unintentional....", "Gotcha. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH at all for wanting to do this, but you have to get the ok from both the bride and your friend. What you\u2019re proposing is wonderful to keep her from getting unwanted attention, but it has to be their call.", "But it is possible to create a padded bra inside the dress. \n\nI know those bras are expensive but many come with removable \"cutlets\" so the fabric can be washed. \n\nIf you are good with fabric/sewing. It is possible to alter the dress on the inside to create a support for the cutlets. \n\nThen dressmakers tape or clear straps or both can prevent a wardrobe malfunction. \n\nThe exterior look of the dress should not be altered without speaking to the bride.\n\nETA: another option is a strapless bustier. Kinda like a light boned corset. If you are helping her get dressed the corset would stay on her body and the dress can be tacked to the corset with a couple stitches. The corset can also support padding. They don't have to be tight either.", "Maybe take it to someone who can get it altered to fit her new shape?", "Yeah, definitely want to run it by the bride. \n\nIf you have time, maybe making straps for everyone would even it out.", "If she has money to spare, there are plenty of prosthetics that she can get on Amazon. Drag queens and trans women use them all the time and can also be found at sex shops/lingerie shops so she wouldn't have to wait.", "Maybe but it's her wedding so that still makes zero sense. I mean are you gonna do it and if the bride is mad say oh it's ok Reddit told me I could? A simple discussion is all that is needed or your friend needs to drop from the wedding if she can't hold an adult conversation.", "Saying she lost weight might make the bride insist on getting the whole thing tailored to fit coz normally it isn't just in one area where straps would solve it", "They would be pretty thin - I'd say an inch to an inch and a half at most.", "I can't give an opinion on that - it's a medical issue that has massively affected her and it's entirely her choice when she feels able to bring it up to others. Very few people know because it's very hard to talk about. I can't say why she is or isn't ready to tell certain people. In her mind she is also worried that a bombshell like \"I have cancer\" would put a damper on the wedding.", "Possibly doesn't want the bride worrying about her in the run up to the big day.", "I thought this too. Invisible straps wouldn't be seen on any photos.", "I totally understand. Thank you for your help.", "I'm not saying that, I'm being empathetic towards the fact that for my friend this isn't just a \"simple discussion\".", "And that's another option. Properly fitted, it may well stay in place without straps.\n\nI was VERY flat-chested for years (until age and a desk job took over my weight). I couldn't \"hold up\" just any strapless dress, but one that was properly fitted and boned would wear just fine. Perhaps that's another alteration that could be proposed.", "Try to find fabric that matches her skin tone and use that for the straps maybe?", "Obviously it's not your decision, but in my opinion, telling her in advance seems a lot less likely to cause problems than showing up to the wedding with an altered dress and having the bride ask \"What happened? Why didn't you tell me you changed the dress?\" \n\nAccidentally falling into a situation where the bride can tell she's hiding something, and pressures her to tell her on the day would be a worse situation. It depends on the personalities of those involved, but it just seems like a bit of a risk.", "I understand that but literally nobody but the bride can make that decision so asking Reddit makes zero sense."]}
