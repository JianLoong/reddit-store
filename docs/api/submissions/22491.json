We weren't exactly friends but she was nice, we'd talk occasionally and had some classes together, her sister was a few years older at the same school (I didn't personally know her but she was known around the school because she was one of the top kids). They were from a poor family and would sometimes leave classes early because they had jobs babysitting, cleaning, things like that. From what I knew, her sister decided not to study after school (not saying college is a must-do or something, just stating the facts). Mia went to the local community college.\n\nMe and Mia lost touch for a bit but I heard from mutual friends her sister got married to a hotshot attorney from an upper class family last year. \n\nSo a few weeks ago, I went to a party with my friends which Mia attended. We said hi, not much else because she was hanging around with her friend and didn't look particularly happy (and was also pretty much at the drinks the whole time she was there). \n\nMe and a couple of my close friends we chatting between ourselves. At one point we were talking about Mia and the conversation turned to her sister for literally a second, and I said to my friends, jokingly, 'how much would you bet she (Mia's sister) divorces the guy within the first couple years and takes half'?\n\nKeep in mind this was a totally private conversation. Mia came over, looked at me and asked what I said. I told her, nothing, I was just chatting to my friends. She kept insisting and telling me to repeat what I said, and when I didn't, Mia went off at me saying she heard what I said and how could I say something like that, it's awful. \n\nShe was a little drunk for sure, but she was still making a big outburst. I later heard from someone else that Mia sister and her husband had been in an accident, which I didn't know about obviously.\n\nI tried to apologize to Mia later, even though she was listening in on our private conversation, but she got really pissed at me.\n\nSome others are saying I shouldn't have said that in the first place.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689604147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1523j6r/aita_for_making_a_joke_with_my_friends_that/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also you were at a party, so no the conversation wasn't \"private\"", "YTA, regardless of the fact that the couple had been in an accident, that \"joke\" about two people you don't know is in extremely poor taste. Implying that someone is a gold digger is a pretty hefty insult.", "YTA.  You admit that you don't know anything about the older sister besides the fact that they came from a poor background.  What you said wasn't a joke. It was tasteless gossip.", "YTA. You sound like a mean girl.\nIt was a \"private\" conversation but Mia was able to hear it. You made a nasty comment about someone you know nothing about and then tried to apologize because \"you didn't know.\" Why are you saying derogatory things about someone you don't even know?", "Omg, are you twelve?! Of course YTA. Stop shit-talking people behind their backs.", "You were talking at a party, loud enough for someone to overhear you. She wasn't eavesdropping, she overheard you and there's a difference. You said something nasty about her sister because you're jealous and petty. Yes, you are indeed the arsehole in this situation. Grow up, stop gossiping about other people's relationships and get your own life. YTA.", "YTA. Why would you even say that about someone you don't know at all? That just seems so unnecessarily rude.", "YTA! You even said you don't know the sister at all, yet you were compelled to talk about her behind her back and then didn't have the courage to repeat what you said because you knew it was tasteless and wrong. Why wouldn't Mia defend her sister. You sound very jealous too. You just HAD to point out that they came from a low-income background, but the sister managed to snag a 'hot shot' and how she was one of the 'top kids'. Very jealous in fact. I find it really, really hard to believe that you're even 24 just by how incredibly immature you're being. YTA.", "YTA that's just plain mean", "YTA. It was not private conversation since she was able to hear you.  Shame on you for stereotyping someone based on how much money they come from", "YTA\n\nYou known literally nothing about Mia's sister or the husband.\n\nYou deliberately said something nasty that you had no business saying. Why? Did you think it made you sound cool or witty? It didn't. You're just a shallow mean girl, that's really so there is to it.\n\nYou said it within earshot of Mia. Hardly a private conversation.\n\nOf course she was angry, you absolutely are the AH here and an insincere apology (we know from your post you don't see that you were in the wrong) is worth nothing.", "\u201cKeep in mind this was a totally private conversation. Mia came over, looked at me and asked what I said.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not private to her when she\u2019s the topic of conversation, and if it was really supposed to be that private\u2026maybe don\u2019t have it at that party. \n\nIt sounds like you never changed from high school into adulthood. You judged her for having to do what she had to do in high school and again you\u2019re judging her now based on her past and current lifestyle. \n\nSo what if she married her husband for money, let her live her life the way she wants. It sounds like you just want to find a reason to gossip about her, and when you did she heard you and confronted you about it. \n\nYour loud mouth got you in trouble and now you\u2019re trying to blame her for overhearing you about it. \n\nGrow tf up and keep your comments to yourself because a lot of other people wouldn\u2019t have a conversation with you, they\u2019d put you in your place. \n\nYTA.", "Of course YTA.  That was a mean spirited thing to say regardless of the accident and regardless of whether you intended it to be overheard or not.  You don't have a magical cone of silence so just because you declare something a private conversation in a setting like a party doesn't automatically make it private.  \n\nPeople telling you you shouldn't have said it at all are right.  You damn sure shouldn't give an 'I'm sorry, but' where you proceed to tell her how it's all her own fault anyway for overhearing a 'private conversation' being held in a public place.  You should just be sorry b/c it was a shitty thing to say.", "OP, Admit you\u2019re at fault. Your words are poison, your attitude is \u2018pathic. Mean, spiteful, cruel, gaslighting, I won\u2019t demean female dogs, but I could go on. \n\nYTA times 1Billion a real MUSKY. \n\nBTW, once out of your mouth\u2026. It is not private.", "YTA; but don\u2019t worry we\u2019re just calling you an asshole as a joke so no big deal right?", "YTA. Ya know those stereotypes about women being gossips and backstabbers? Congratulations, you lived up to it. And worse, you're a coward for not standing by what you said. There is no part of this situation where you're the good guy and the fact that you had to go on the internet to ask strangers if you were the bad guy here only signals that you have a narcissistic need for attention and hoped to find more sycophants to support your views. Never say anything behind someone's back that you wouldn't say to their face.", "YTA-Those kind of jokes aren\u2019t appropriate especially when someone can overhear you.", "YTA. There is never really an expectation of private in public and you were having a conversation a few feet away from the person whose family you were gossiping meanly about.", "YTA\n\nWhat you said what shitty and judgemental. Doesn't matter if the conversation was private or not. Also, there isn't really such thing as a private conversation at party. Her overhearing you trash talking her sister isn't the problem you think it is", "Being overheard isn\u2019t the same as listening in. The gossiping was done within her earshot. She obviously heard enough due to asking you to say it to her face. Based on your attitude in telling the story, YTA.", "YTA. You don't even know Mia's sister. \n\n\"her sister decided not to study after school\" - \"They were from a poor family\": why does these things matter enough for you to dare mean comment about someone you don't know. \n\nMaking this kind of comments says much more about you than it does about other people. Get a life so you don't need to gossip about others. Or become the gold-digger you're suggesting other women are... Tacky, hefty, bad intentioned, unneeded. Take this as a chance to learn and mind your business.", "Yta", "YTA. Grow up", "YTA. You admit you don't know them personally. Seems all you know is that their family was poor and they had to work to have food and shelter. You seem jealous that the sister married a \"hotshot attorney\". Then you talk shit about the marriage at a party. \n\nYou definitely shouldn't have said anything at all about the sister's marriage because YOU DON'T KNOW shit.", "YTA and you sound jealous and judgemental as hell!.", "I dont care how private this conversation was. How private could it be if she heard you talking shit?  \"How much would you bet she (Mia's sister) divorces the guy within the first couple years and takes half'?\" is such a petty, mean girl thing to say. If I heard someone talking shit about my sister I would not have to be drunk to tell you to your face, not a private convo, that you are a total petty asshole.  Get over yourself, you shouldn't have said it in the first place, especially so loud that others could hear you. But then you have the bulk size audacity to complain that she was listening to a private conversation. WOW. YTA.", "Obviously yta, that's some straight up mean girls shit.  How dare her sister marry outside her station, she must be a gold digger.", "YTA.  It wasn\u2019t a private conversation, you were at a party and Mia was within earshot.  You made a disparaging comment about her sister and by proxy, her family\u2019s socio-economic status.  She jumped to her sister\u2019s defense, as any good sibling would do.  You knew it was the wrong thing to say, because you were cowardly and wouldn\u2019t even admit to saying it when she confronted you. \nAlso, stop using Mia\u2019s alcohol consumption as a distraction for your shitty \u201cjoke.\u201d", "YTA grow up.", "YTA. You shouldn't have said it in the first place.", "YTA. You were obviously loud enough that Mia could hear you from where she was standing. That is not a private conversation, its mean girl behaviour. It's interesting that you thought she married for money rather than love. Sounds like you are judging someone by your own standards.", "YTA. So you were having a private Convo at a party??? OP sounds awful", "YTA", "YTA. In all fairness though, people probably say much worse behind your back about you: the pathetically bitter, jealous, and judgmental girl who never grew up from high school.", "YTA.  Really?
