Anyone not happy with the way your husband handled that situation should be told to keep out your lives as well. \n\nI'd say your husband perfectly handled that situation.

Let him shout. Loudly and often over this. She clearly needs to get on board or get out of your life.", "NTA\n\nShe wanted to air her hate publicly, so she should expect the response to be public as well.
