You can scale up or down as you need. I\u2019ve put the brands I prefer to use for each thing but you can use whatever you have in the cupboard if you don\u2019t want to use something specific \n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n- 1 tbsp vanilla paste (or extract)\n- 2 tsp instant coffee granules (dissolved in the minimum amount of water possible)\n- 2 large eggs at room temp\n- 170g unsalted butter\n\n- 75g all purpose flour\n- 80g Dutch processed cocoa powder (valrhona, callebaut, or guittard cocoa rouge - Dutch process is better because of alkalisation something something science)\n- 280g granulated white sugar (you may want to add more)\n- 3g salt\n- 115g dark chocolate (70% - again I prefer to use callebaut or valrhona but you can use any brand, you essentially want a high cocoa %. If it comes in a bar you need to chop it into chunks)\n\n**METHOD**\n\n1. TAKE OUT THE EGGS SO THEY ARE ROOM TEMP. NO I AM NOT KIDDING THIS MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE\n2. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C\n3. Weigh the butter into a heatproof bowl and place bowl into the warming oven\n4. Grease and line the pan\n5. Mix the flour, salt, and cocoa powder together in another bowl. Whisk so there are no lumps\n6. Remove the heatproof bowl from the oven once the butter is all or mostly melted.\n7. Add the sugar to the butter and whisk together gently until just incorporated - better to do by hand, as a machine goes too quick and then breaks the butter and you\u2019ll end up with crumbling brownies\n8. Add one egg to the butter and sugar mixture and beat in until just incorporated. Then repeat with the second egg. Mixture should look lighter now.\n9. Mix in the vanilla paste.\n10. Stir in the coffee.\n11. Slowly add in the dry ingredients a few tbsp at a time, whisking gently. It will be thick by the time you\u2019re done, maybe even a paste like batter.\n12. Fold in the chocolate pieces.\n13. Put brownie mix into baking tray. Optionally sprinkle some more chocolate chunks over the top.\n\n**14. TURN DOWN OVEN TEMP TO 180\u00b0C**\n\n15. Bake in the oven for approximately 35/40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.\n\n16. Allow to cool completely to room temp before you cut them and sprinkle a little flaked salt on top.\n\nEnjoy! Let me know how they turn out!", "Posted in another comment!
