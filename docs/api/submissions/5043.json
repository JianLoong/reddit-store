{"id": 5043, "submission_id": "zp2kch", "title": "AITA for not going to my parents wedding before they get divorced again?", "selftext": "My friends told me to make a Reddit account just for this because this is so weird and no one knows if I\u2019m in the right.\n\nSo my(26f) parents (b50) got married when I was five and I was the flower girl. Around when I was ten they got divorced which no one saw coming because they NEVER fought. I feel like I have to mention my parents are both very wealthy and kept finances separate and so it was an easy divorce and obviously they could pay for it.\n\nWhen I was about 17ish they decided to get back together. Me being 17, was overjoyed and was a bridesmaid at their second wedding. I really hope you see where this is going but they ended up separating again. They didn\u2019t tell anyone and didn\u2019t get a divorce but we all knew they were separated and 3 years later they wanted to \u201crenew their vows\u201d in which I was asked to buy a nice dress for the occasion.\n\nSurprise! They got divorced! Again! And only after 3 months after their renewal. After that I sort of just lived my own life because I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled at whatever they were doing and honestly really over it.\n\nSo a few days ago I got an invite in the mail to my parents 3/4th wedding after 6 years and so I called my mom about it. She was super excited and told me I was old enough to be her MOH and that she wants me to buy a 1500 dress. That\u2019s a solid No from me. I told her I\u2019d be her MOH but I\u2019m either going to wear the original bridesmaid dress (which is a cream color) or the other nice one I got (which is brown) because I\u2019m not buying a 1500 dollar dress. She freaked out and told me that those don\u2019t match the color scheme (pink and green) and that she knows I can afford it.\n\nWhich is true. I got an inheritance from my grandfathers passing. However, when my fianc\u00e9 and I moved in together, he made clear he didn\u2019t want me to be paying for most things and he wants to do it 50/50. So we got a small apartment that he could afford to pay his share of and all of my extra money is in savings/college fund because we want a large family of 5-7 kids and they are\u2026 well expensive. So I reminded my mom of that and told her that I also would like to use my money on other things that won\u2019t be worn once and I\u2019ll have to buy a new one every 3-6 years\n\nMy mom called me a spoiled brat and that I\u2019m wasting my privilege (I have no words) and that I\u2019m telling her I won\u2019t be apart of my own parents wedding. I told her that I was going to be willing to show up to the wedding and not be the MOH, but at this point I\u2019m not showing up at all and told her to call me when they get their next divorce. I hung up and got a slew of nasty emails from my family throughout the day and my friends are divided on if I made the right call with the premise that they are my parents.

I'm sorry but once it's the 3rd-4th time *to the same person* it's no longer a special event or moment. That's just a massive display of stupidity. It's totally reasonable that, if they are doing this every 5 years or so, to say that either they really should NOT be together, or, that they really want the attention.
