Around when I was ten they got divorced which no one saw coming because they NEVER fought. I feel like I have to mention my parents are both very wealthy and kept finances separate and so it was an easy divorce and obviously they could pay for it.\n\nWhen I was about 17ish they decided to get back together. Me being 17, was overjoyed and was a bridesmaid at their second wedding. I really hope you see where this is going but they ended up separating again. They didn\u2019t tell anyone and didn\u2019t get a divorce but we all knew they were separated and 3 years later they wanted to \u201crenew their vows\u201d in which I was asked to buy a nice dress for the occasion.\n\nSurprise! They got divorced! Again! And only after 3 months after their renewal. After that I sort of just lived my own life because I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled at whatever they were doing and honestly really over it.\n\nSo a few days ago I got an invite in the mail to my parents 3/4th wedding after 6 years and so I called my mom about it. She was super excited and told me I was old enough to be her MOH and that she wants me to buy a 1500 dress. That\u2019s a solid No from me. I told her I\u2019d be her MOH but I\u2019m either going to wear the original bridesmaid dress (which is a cream color) or the other nice one I got (which is brown) because I\u2019m not buying a 1500 dollar dress. She freaked out and told me that those don\u2019t match the color scheme (pink and green) and that she knows I can afford it.\n\nWhich is true. I got an inheritance from my grandfathers passing. However, when my fianc\u00e9 and I moved in together, he made clear he didn\u2019t want me to be paying for most things and he wants to do it 50/50. So we got a small apartment that he could afford to pay his share of and all of my extra money is in savings/college fund because we want a large family of 5-7 kids and they are\u2026 well expensive. So I reminded my mom of that and told her that I also would like to use my money on other things that won\u2019t be worn once and I\u2019ll have to buy a new one every 3-6 years\n\nMy mom called me a spoiled brat and that I\u2019m wasting my privilege (I have no words) and that I\u2019m telling her I won\u2019t be apart of my own parents wedding. I told her that I was going to be willing to show up to the wedding and not be the MOH, but at this point I\u2019m not showing up at all and told her to call me when they get their next divorce. I hung up and got a slew of nasty emails from my family throughout the day and my friends are divided on if I made the right call with the premise that they are my parents.

Both had problems cheating on the other but eventually just stopped i guess. Shits wild", "Sounds like it's about money to me. Transfer assets into your partners name or \"lose\" them in the divorce settlement then go bankrupt (officially anyway). Remarry after the 2-3 year period with all debts of the bankrupt partner wiped out. It's definitely a trick but doing it 4 times is running a real risk of attracting tax office attention...", "I can understand why people do it once, people grow and change and such. I don\u2019t understand why people give a relationship a third (or fourth, or whatever) chance. If it hasn\u2019t worked out twice, take the hint.", "Someone just likes getting married", "NTA. And this isn't even bc it is their fourth wedding.", "I feel bad for them if they can only have great sex on wedding nights. That\u2019s only 4 nights.", "Imagine if they stopped marrying each other and got married to others. Courts can be really pedantic about this and might just make them bring all three divorce papers to prove they've been divorced or something. I think they deserve each other", "Someone has a wedding addiction.", "One wonders if they are registering every time.  It's a good scheme to get new dishes!", "That\u2019s fine if they want to do their own thing. But just like it\u2019s gauche to expect wedding gifts for a vow renew, it\u2019s also very entitled of them to expect you to spend even $100 on a dress. They can either be casual like most vow renewals or if they want to be extra, it\u2019s at their own expense. No way I would spend a cent on their self absorbed party.", "Some of the weddings might have been attempts at \"saving the marriage\" which you know, at least it wasn't a baby.", "They're certainly devoted, I just can't tell to what \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA", "NTA but I would still send them a small book. Maybe on how to maintain a marriage or how to love yourself? \n\nAs for your inheritance, if it is brought up again, tell your mom to stay out of your finances! How you choose to spend your money is up to you!", "NTA, your parents need to get it together", "Good for u for standing up and not buying into their bullshit\u2026sounds like an excuse to scam presents from everyone.", "NOT the AH\nWhat a bunch of self centered all about kinds BS people!!\nThe weekend of the wedding I'd go off with the BF have a little fun, life is TOO short!!!  ( do stuff off season a little less $)", "Maybe you could go to the next one", "NTA I have a very strong opinion about on/off relationships, which is that I think they're incredibly unhealthy. If you are having fights with your partner so bad that they cause you to break up on the regular, that is not healthy. It just sounds exhausting. Obviously there are exceptions, but that is my overall statement.", "NTA, why can\u2019t she just pay for it for $1,500.  I think some would question even going to the 4th wedding.", "NTA your parents are indecisive", "NTA. Sounds like separating is their form of dealing with any argument. Until they actually resolve it, the cycle will continue. Doesn't mean you have to be on the merry-go-round with them.", "INFO: Which date do they use when celebrating their anniversary?", "NTA\n\nTell them to just go to the courthouse to sign the papers as its a waste of money to add to the many divorces", "All I can think of is your mother a fan of Elizabeth Taylor only taking it to a whole new level. ET only married 1 of her husband's twice - she was married 8 times over her lifetime. \nYour parents marriages are the definition of insanity. NTA", "NTA. Your mom is insane and incredibly entitled. Tell her you won\u2019t be spending $1500 on a dress for her wedding because you gave your own wedding dress to pay for. Tell her $250 is your max price and that is all you will spend total for this wedding and all her future weddings combined so she better choose wisely. \n\nNTA. And you are not entitled. Your mom is\u2026 something else.", "NTA.", "NTA. She pushed it, you pushed back.", "It sounds like other than their  marrying each over and over you like/ love your parents. Be there for them but yeah hard pass on buying another dress. Who knows they are older so maybe it will stick.\n\nAlso NTA", "NTA. It's hard to believe that your parents have the gall to have another wedding. Are they both huge narcissists?", "NTA. From what you\u2019ve explained in your post I think we all know this next marriage won\u2019t last long either. Sounds like a toxic relationship.", "My bff\u2019s parents had this 25-30 year cycle of fighting, separating, and then rekindling their love with swooping romantic gestures and wanting all the family and children to rejoice with them each time. It was like how they kept the passion going. If they had had money like OP\u2019s parents do, I have no doubt they\u2019d be divorcing and remarrying each other. Just seems like a sick way some \u201ccouples\u201d entertain themselves or something.", "three times if vow renewal counts...", "They love the drama but can't deal with ordinary life, is my take.", "to be clear, one divorce or two?", "It sounds like they both just have some kind of weird wedding fetish.", "wear the t-shirts to the wedding", "Wait. You mentioned pink and (neon) green. Are these colors like what VP Harris's sorority (the name....?) wears? I love those colors, but they are a commitment. (I could not get away with them in this lifetime, but still love them.) I mean those colors seem to be able to commit to each other in ways your parents haven't figured out. Sadly, a color scheme probably won't solve anything. If there is something needing solved, that is. If your parents are just addicted to getting married to each other, I have to say that isn't even close to being the worst addiction for parents to have. Sorry I got off on a tangent here.", "That's what I was just telling my husband or have an open relationship if they're splitting to get laid by something new! But after wedding #2 I'd be done lol no way in hell I'd go to wedding #3 to the same exact two people lol family or not!", "Two weddings, two divorces!", "That just sounds like more trouble than it's worth", "Maybe if I really liked cake I would.", "Of course they are, wouldn\u2019t want to waste their privilege!"]}
