This is ridiculous.  Who cares when you mom bought her dress? Is this really a thing?

NTA.", "NTA\n\nI'm a bride to be, and my wedding is coming up.  This is a really, really old rule that doesn't have much of a place in modern weddings.  I don't know a single bride who has cared about it.  I only know about it because my grandma kept all her bridal planning materials, and since she passed before my wedding, I've been reading them. \n\nIn fact, I have no earthly clue if my future MIL has bought her dress yet.  My mom has bought 3 so far (returned the ones she didn't like), and since there's still a couple months until the wedding, she may go back and get a fourth.  But I would never expect anyone else (especially the mother of the groom) to delay their outfit planning for her.  \n\nSo long as your mom consulted with the bride to make sure her dress was suitable in terms of color and style (here: dress code and length), there shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA\n\nWhat asshole makes these stupid and ridiculous \"wedding protocols\" and why do people follow them?  I get the white for bride only dress.  I get the no pregnancy or proposals at the wedding.  This, however, is another level of dumbassery.", "NTA,  that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.", "NOOOOOOOO! NTA. What tradition? Who said MOB gets to buy her dress first? How does anything get done if everyone has to wait for one person to do something on her own schedule, just whenever she feels like? Why does anyone even need to know when or where or how MOB and MOG buy their dresses???", "NTA I think the comment from your SIL is referring to an old idea that the mother of the bride gets to pick first and then the groom\u2019s mother should pick something after in order to avoid her ordering similar or the same thing. But yeah, it\u2019s quite an old concept in my opinion and doesn\u2019t really work in modern society where people aren\u2019t as close and the logistics of shopping these days (shipping and all that).", "Soooo NTA. The whole point of this archaic tradition is to ensure both mothers do not wear the same color on the wedding day. Your mom asked what colors to avoid and respected their list. If they didn\u2019t like her color choice, they should have given your mom a list of what colors she CAN wear. Better yet, fuck them. People should be able to wear whatever they want so long as they are not upstaging the bride.", "NTA.\n\nWhile it is traditional for the MoB to choose her dress first, and then the MoG co-ordinate with that choice, the extenuating circumstance is that the MoG needed to order sooner in order to have a dress that fit appropriately.   It's wonderful the MoB can buy off the rack and waltz through life, not everyone has that option so the bride needs to adjust her expectations.\n\nThe next time the Bride complains, your brother should ask her if she would rather his mother come to the wedding in her slip, or in an ill-fitting dress that would look horrible in pictures, because those were the other two options available... unless she'd rather not marry into such an 'uncouth' family that actually prioritized looking nice for their big day over a (very meaningless under the circumstances) point of etiquette.", "NTA. I hate these stupid old-fashioned wedding traditions. They are completely out of place in the 21st century and they only serve to make women anxious and to pit women against each other (notice how men don\u2019t get stressed about these things?) Your SIL sounds like someone who is going to scrutinize every little thing that people are doing and believe that they are trying to sabotage her \u201cbig day\u201d. \n\nIf she and your brother decide to have kids, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s like this for a baby shower or some other equally horrid pre-baby event.", "NTA. Yes, your mom broke with tradition. But it's a stupid tradition.", "INFO Did your mom check with the bride and/or her mother before she selected a color?", "NTA.

I\u2019ve literally never heard of this tradition, and the MOB does not get to hold the MOG hostage while she takes her sweet time picking something out. WTF?", "NTA\n\nYour mom really doesn't need to coordinate her clothing choices with your brother's future MIL. Expecting anyone to wait until the last minute to rush out and buy a dress is completely unreasonable.", "That's not a thing. There's no hierarchy of who buys their dress first. NTA", "Nta there is no tradition to require the mom of the bride buy her dress first. That is ridiculous.Be prepared to have this nut job join your family.", "NTA, most definitely. \nFWIW, I am an MOB. My daughter is getting married next summer. I have no idea if the MOG has bought a dress yet, nor do I care. \nAll my daughter has said is she wants our dresses to complement her chosen colors for the bridal party, which is of course perfectly reasonable.

She\u2019s nuts. NTA.", "Because I have a fondness for reading old etiquette books -- the tradition started because technically the parents of the bride are the hosts of the wedding. Dad wears a suit or whatever. The MOB chooses her dress first because, as the host, she sets the dress code and expectations for the wedding. Having the MOG go second means a) there's no way they can end up wearing the same dress and b) there's no way for the MOG to \"outshine\" the MOB, because she'll see MOB's dress and know to take it half a step down -- her dress should have fewer embellishments and should not be more formal than MOB's dress.\n\nThis is also the reason that technically you shouldn't stand at the bride's entrance until and unless her mother stands first. As the hostess (and dad is presumably walking the bride down the aisle), she gives the signal that the event is about to start by rising.\n\nI can also bore you with many details about place settings and napkin options.", "Yes, the bride and her mom gave my mom a list of colors to avoid which was green and black. My mom ended up with a rose gold dress which another issue is they said it\u2019s too similar to white?? so they are unhappy about the color she chose.", "Yeah, u/poetic_justice987 is correct on this one. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your FSIL & the MOB are simply spoiling for a fight for some odd reason. Maybe it's something as simple as basic fatphobia, because your mom had to order her dress in advance while MOB is off the rack. It's also possible that your mom already having a planned outfit has set them off with some form of organization envy. Options ranging from Drama Queens, the price of tea in China, or a fart in their general direction two years ago might be considered as well.\n\nIt may or may not be worth it to find the underlying cause of this weird reaction, but whatever- NTA.", "I\u2019d say that as long as she checked on color, she\u2019s followed the tradition appropriately. Also, the traditional color for her dress would be champagne\u2014which is a lot closer to white than what she chose.

And... even if she grabbed it off the rack... who the fuck cares?  Grab what you look and feel good in.  It may not be there a month from the weddi g. I'm short and fat and it's hard for me to find stuff.  You bet I'm buying it on the spot of I like it.nta", "NTA!  Sounds like old traditions never die even when it makes common sense!  Oh I forgot,  immobile sense isn\u2019t so common!", "NTA.  Who even keeps track of this stuff?!  You buy something when you find it.  I can't imagine stressing out at the last minute trying to find something to wear (that pretty much guarantees there will be nothing out there that looks appropriate).  Even guys have things altered that they wear to a wedding and allow for extra time to have that done.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never heard of this ridiculous rule, and probably for good reason, because it\u2019s so ridiculous.", "NTA.  If this is a tradition, it's seriously out of date.

Traditionally the MOG also wears beige and shuts up.\n\nShe found a great dress before my brothers wedding, long, beige with beads and sequins on the bodice, marked down to $48 and said she wanted to be buried in it to get her money's worth.\nShe has since passed and because the dress was short sleeved, they told me to get a shawl or pashmina which they brought around her shoulders to meet at her hands in a heart shape.

I have NEVER heard of such a unusual tradition  that the Mother of the Bride has to purchase the dress before the Mother of the Groom.\n\nYour mother was aware of the diffiuclties of finding a dress asa plus size person, and found one.  She even had to pay for expedited delivery.\n\nIf she want for the Mother of the Bride, she wouldn't;t have a dress to wear at all.\n\nThen to be aware the Mother of the Bride made sure she had a dress for when she was Mother of the Groom, just means there is a double standard that the bride is using.
