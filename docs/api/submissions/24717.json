The home just appraised for $700k.\n\nFor context; I have also been appointed the executor of her estate. Her will was written in 2015 and stated for the property to be \u201csold and the proceeds split\u201d between my brother and I. My aunt and I were very close and she had expressed to me in the year or so leading to her passing away that she wished to modify her will to leave the property to me outright and compensate my brother by designating him the beneficiary of some IRAs she held, but it never happened. My brother and my aunt were not close at all; he only called her when he needed something.\n\nThe property has sentimental value to me; and I have the means to purchase it at this point in my life. My brother\u2019s wishes are to co-own it together, despite he and I having a poor relationship. I expressed to my brother that I wasn\u2019t interested in co-owning property with anyone except my wife for financial independence. I didn\u2019t express to him that a large reason of not wanting to co-own is because of his financial instability (he doesn\u2019t have an income, he\u2019s 28 and still lives with my Dad, and has terrible credit, and tons of medical bills.) My fear was that he would use the property as a place to stay disproportionately to his 50%, or not be able to pay for 50% of the upkeep related to it. I did however express that I would invite him to visit as a guest, but I just wasn\u2019t interested in co-owning.\n\nHe said that if my wishes were to buy it, he\u2019d want 60% of the fair market value for his 50%, which I think is unreasonable. He believes we could sell the property for more than $700k, which I agree is certainly a possibility although unlikely. Even if I sold for more than $700k, we\u2019d also probably spend 6+% on real estate commission, plus the additional expenses associated with it sitting on the market (taxes, utilities, etc.). Unless we found a buyer to pay more than $50k over appraised value, I think that my brother walks away with the most cash in the scenario of me buying it.\n\nFast forward; I have a pre-approval letter for $350,000 financing. I learned from my estate lawyer that because my brother is an heir to the proceeds of this property, and that I\u2019m simultaneously the executor of the estate and a third party buyer that I can just proceed with the purchase price of $350,000 from the estate. He doesn\u2019t really have a say in the sale price as long as it\u2019s the appraised value or higher. My lawyer advised that if he feels entitled to more, he\u2019d have to take the estate to court over it, and he\u2019d lose 99% of the time.\n\nMy brother has also been spreading slander to the rest of our family; stating that I\u2019m spending all the money in the estate checking account and that I\u2019m \u201cshady\u201d and probably paying off my primary house\u2019s mortgage with the estates money.. (100% not true, and also illegal).\n\nIf I proceed with the sale of the house to myself without my brother being happy about it, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692122614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rzx1d/aita_for_purchasing_a_property_that_was_left_to/", "score": 478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s not trustworthy and will be even more difficult especially since he\u2019d have more leverage as a proper co-owner. Best just to cut him a check now while you have the chance. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the rest of your family. The truth is on your side.

You need to cut that brother out of your life. Life is short enough to deal with such negativity. But if you feel like you have to defend yourself then stick to the truth. Point out that your brother has no job, no savings, and no means of paying for 50% of the upkeep and taxes on the house and that as executor of the will you are actually following your aunt's wishes because she had said she wished for you to have the home outright but that the will was never updated to reflect this.

You're doing everything by the book and there's no scenario where he gets the 100% of the house he wants without him really screwing you over because he can't afford it.\n\nCo-ownership with someone you're not married to is an absolute nightmare, because usually the tenants in common default (I'm assuming you're in the US here) does technically give him the rights to occupy the whole thing whenever he wants, so long as he doesn't exclude you. Imagine trying to negotiate a 50/50 split on things with him. No thanks. Doesn't sound like he could afford to buy 50% of it out of the estate either, so it was never really an option and he's just delusional that it was ever on the table. Also, you're basically giving him $350K he never had to earn free and clear to buy him out of his 50%. That's more money than he's ever going to see in his life if he keeps up not having income and living with his parents.\n\nKeep your papers tidy and your nose clean, OP.

But buying a property doesn't work on the premise of \"technically this is the same result.\" If OP is a 3rd party buyer, OP has to provide a downpayment + financing to cover the ENTIRE cost at the time of sale.", "Yes ok that\u2019s fair. But it also depends a lot on the state laws for how ownership and estates etc operate", "Then OP can please clarify.", "My lender is treating this financing as a refinance; I will have 50% equity from my inherited half and I only need $350k to buy the rest of the house from the estate.", "Edited to YTA.\n\n~~I won't venture a judgement.~~  But it seems ethically wrong for OP to take advantage of his/her position as executor NOT to put the house on the market.  OP has a conflict of interest since OP as executor should be trying to realise as much as possible for the beneficiaries.  Not doing so means they are doing their brother out of the possibility of 50% of any uplift.  \n\nI take OP's point about the associated costs of holding on to the house during the selling period, plus commission.  So a fair way forward would be to put the house on the market, and as long as the top offer was over OP's $750k ($700k plus extra costs), for OP to match the top offer plus \u00a31.  \n\nThis is how the different courses of action play out.\n\nScenario 1 - OP matches the paper valuation & buys house for $700k.  **Brother gets $350k.**\n\nScenario 2 - They put it up for sale and don't get an offer in excess of $750k.  Once $50k commission & utilities are taken into account, the net gain would be less than $700k.  They therefore revert to Scenario 1.  **Brother gets $350k.**\n\nScenario 3 - They put it up for sale and get a top offer from an outside party of (say) $760k.  Instead of OP buying the property, they go ahead with selling it externally.  The net gain (after OP's estimate of $50k commission & utilities) is $710k.  **Brother gets $355k.**\n\nScenario 4 - OP matches the $760k plus $1, to make theirs the top offer.  The estate won't have to pay realtor's commission (since it's not a sale to an outside party - I think), so the only cost to the estate is \\~$10k of utility costs.  The net gain is $750k, and **brother gets $375k**.  OP pays brother $350k from their pre-approved finance & will have to find another $25k to total the $375k due to the brother.  If OP can't afford that, then they will have to revert to Scenario 3, in which brother gets $355k. \n\nOnly Scenario 4 fulfils the executor's duty to maximise the realised value of the assets.  I'm a little suspicious of the lawyer's advice to OP: it seems to be saying, \"well, you *could* sell at the paper valuation you have, even though you aren't acting to maximise the value of the assets.  Your brother's only recourse would be to sue you.\"  In some circumstances, that might be reasonable, but the kicker for me is that the lawyer ignores the point that OP - rather than the borther - is going to benefit from this route.  It's the conflict of interest that (after I've typed all this out) makes me think that OP is YTA.", "NTA. You are absolutely right about what would happen if the two of you co-owned the property. He would end up living in it and you would end up paying the bills. \n\nChange the locks!", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif it is sold on the free market, you an get more than appraisal value.

Meaning: YOur lawyer can't tell, but it is likely you will win. 99% is: Pretty sure, but no guaranties. And **you will know who won after years, and after wasting a good part of the house value. Giving him 10% over appraisal is cheap in comparison.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you want this to be over fast, simply be fair: Set a price, and let HIM decide to buy or sell at that price.
