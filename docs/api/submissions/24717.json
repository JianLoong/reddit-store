The home just appraised for $700k.\n\nFor context; I have also been appointed the executor of her estate. Her will was written in 2015 and stated for the property to be \u201csold and the proceeds split\u201d between my brother and I. My aunt and I were very close and she had expressed to me in the year or so leading to her passing away that she wished to modify her will to leave the property to me outright and compensate my brother by designating him the beneficiary of some IRAs she held, but it never happened. My brother and my aunt were not close at all; he only called her when he needed something.\n\nThe property has sentimental value to me; and I have the means to purchase it at this point in my life. My brother\u2019s wishes are to co-own it together, despite he and I having a poor relationship. I expressed to my brother that I wasn\u2019t interested in co-owning property with anyone except my wife for financial independence. I didn\u2019t express to him that a large reason of not wanting to co-own is because of his financial instability (he doesn\u2019t have an income, he\u2019s 28 and still lives with my Dad, and has terrible credit, and tons of medical bills.) My fear was that he would use the property as a place to stay disproportionately to his 50%, or not be able to pay for 50% of the upkeep related to it. I did however express that I would invite him to visit as a guest, but I just wasn\u2019t interested in co-owning.\n\nHe said that if my wishes were to buy it, he\u2019d want 60% of the fair market value for his 50%, which I think is unreasonable. He believes we could sell the property for more than $700k, which I agree is certainly a possibility although unlikely. Even if I sold for more than $700k, we\u2019d also probably spend 6+% on real estate commission, plus the additional expenses associated with it sitting on the market (taxes, utilities, etc.). Unless we found a buyer to pay more than $50k over appraised value, I think that my brother walks away with the most cash in the scenario of me buying it.\n\nFast forward; I have a pre-approval letter for $350,000 financing. I learned from my estate lawyer that because my brother is an heir to the proceeds of this property, and that I\u2019m simultaneously the executor of the estate and a third party buyer that I can just proceed with the purchase price of $350,000 from the estate. He doesn\u2019t really have a say in the sale price as long as it\u2019s the appraised value or higher. My lawyer advised that if he feels entitled to more, he\u2019d have to take the estate to court over it, and he\u2019d lose 99% of the time.\n\nMy brother has also been spreading slander to the rest of our family; stating that I\u2019m spending all the money in the estate checking account and that I\u2019m \u201cshady\u201d and probably paying off my primary house\u2019s mortgage with the estates money.. (100% not true, and also illegal).\n\nIf I proceed with the sale of the house to myself without my brother being happy about it, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692122614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rzx1d/aita_for_purchasing_a_property_that_was_left_to/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But unfortunately I don\u2019t see a way for you to get outta this without damaging your relationship with your brother. \n\nIf u are worried about what family thinks, you could share a factual description of the steps you\u2019re taking and the laws you\u2019re following. Like full on no emotion, just steps. \n\nThen it\u2019s outta your hands. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re trying to be fair and if that is in line with your aunt\u2019s wishes, then your conscience should rest easy.

And it seems clear that he\u2019s not in a position to buy you out. \n\n350K sound like more than reasonable amount. That is life changing money for your brother. Its enough money for him to outright buy or put a downpayment on a home for himself. You don\u2019t want to go through the process of selling the house with him. He\u2019s not trustworthy and will be even more difficult especially since he\u2019d have more leverage as a proper co-owner. Best just to cut him a check now while you have the chance. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the rest of your family. The truth is on your side. If you have no qualms about being transparent with your actions as executor then you shouldn\u2019t have an issue persuading reasonable minds. So I suspect that most everyone will come around unless they\u2019re cut from the same clothe as your brother.", "I mean, its a reasonable solution to a disagreement that wont have any other resolution, he gets his fair share, and its legal (im just going to assume you are correct because I have no idea). I would say NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also like to know why he thinks he should get 60% of the value when he has 50% ownership.", "NTA. But tell him that he also has the opportunity to purchase the house for the same amount of money that you are giving him. Put it in writing where he signs his choice of to purchase the home or to sell it. Tell him that you will never agree to joint ownership with him. So he has the option to buy you out or you buy him out. But he will need to provide the same purchase price you will give him. Not a penny more. If he buys you out, you can then choose to purchase a different home. Betting he won\u2019t, and for $350,000 he can purchase his own home.", "Listen to the lawyer, NTA.", "NTA. You need to cut that brother out of your life. Life is short enough to deal with such negativity. But if you feel like you have to defend yourself then stick to the truth. Point out that your brother has no job, no savings, and no means of paying for 50% of the upkeep and taxes on the house and that as executor of the will you are actually following your aunt's wishes because she had said she wished for you to have the home outright but that the will was never updated to reflect this. If other members of your family do not believe you, well, tell them to get stuffed. Blood is not thicker than water and there is absolutely no need to have anything to do with family members who are toxic.", "Proceed.  NTA.  But plan on hearing at every family gathering from now until eternity your brother telling everyone your screwed him.", "NTA but the question isn't if you're an ass hole or not it's if you want a relationship with your brother or not. Regardless of who is right or wrong if you go ahead with this decision it will end the relationship with your brother and likely cause some members of your family to no longer like you. Not saying that's what you deserve, but that's what's going to happen. \n\nYou have to decide what matters more to you", "YWNBTA. Selling a house owned by the estate to a family member for 100% of the appraisal price is basically the absolute best-case scenario for an estate. What a probate win.\n\nSounds like brother is a deadbeat and wanted the entirety of the house to himself, which isn't going to happen, so he is just going to make this as difficult as possible. You're doing everything by the book and there's no scenario where he gets the 100% of the house he wants without him really screwing you over because he can't afford it.\n\nCo-ownership with someone you're not married to is an absolute nightmare, because usually the tenants in common default (I'm assuming you're in the US here) does technically give him the rights to occupy the whole thing whenever he wants, so long as he doesn't exclude you. Imagine trying to negotiate a 50/50 split on things with him. No thanks. Doesn't sound like he could afford to buy 50% of it out of the estate either, so it was never really an option and he's just delusional that it was ever on the table. Also, you're basically giving him $350K he never had to earn free and clear to buy him out of his 50%. That's more money than he's ever going to see in his life if he keeps up not having income and living with his parents.\n\nKeep your papers tidy and your nose clean, OP. And get that estate lawyer on retainer if you haven't already. This one is going to get ugly.", "NTA. \n\nI would, however, have him sign a contract stating that he can be a co-owner until he fails to uphold his share of taxes & upkeep. That he will be bought out & his share of missed upkeep will be deducted out of his share of the buy-out. I would also put in stipulations that use for each of you can not exceed 7 days at one time or 150 days total use in a year unless agreed upon by both parties.\n\nBefore & after I would always take a date/time stamped video of the condition of the home after every use so you have proof of what damages are yours vs his for upkeep. Or hire a 3rd party to do this regularly.\n\nI would also show the family the contract. It's a good compromise to show transparency. As well as informing the family of the ins & outs that he is not understanding.\n\nEdit: I would also provide proof of what the previous 2 yrs of taxes were & a reasonable guess based on past years for general up keep.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your aunt picked the level headed reasonable person to handle her estate.  Handle it.", "Your lawyer lied to you. You can\u2019t force him to sell. That\u2019s not how this works. Legally he owns half. I would get a second opinion on selling the house out from under him even if you are the buyer. He HAS to agree to sell his half. YTA. You can\u2019t take his inheritance from him bc you want it and don\u2019t want to share. You can\u2019t take his inheritance from him bc she said she wanted to change it but didn\u2019t.

But buying a property doesn't work on the premise of \"technically this is the same result.\" If OP is a 3rd party buyer, OP has to provide a downpayment + financing to cover the ENTIRE cost at the time of sale.", "Yes ok that\u2019s fair. But it also depends a lot on the state laws for how ownership and estates etc operate", "Then OP can please clarify.", "My lender is treating this financing as a refinance; I will have 50% equity from my inherited half and I only need $350k to buy the rest of the house from the estate."]}
