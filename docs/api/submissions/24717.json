The home just appraised for $700k.\n\nFor context; I have also been appointed the executor of her estate. Her will was written in 2015 and stated for the property to be \u201csold and the proceeds split\u201d between my brother and I. My aunt and I were very close and she had expressed to me in the year or so leading to her passing away that she wished to modify her will to leave the property to me outright and compensate my brother by designating him the beneficiary of some IRAs she held, but it never happened. My brother and my aunt were not close at all; he only called her when he needed something.\n\nThe property has sentimental value to me; and I have the means to purchase it at this point in my life. My brother\u2019s wishes are to co-own it together, despite he and I having a poor relationship. I expressed to my brother that I wasn\u2019t interested in co-owning property with anyone except my wife for financial independence. I didn\u2019t express to him that a large reason of not wanting to co-own is because of his financial instability (he doesn\u2019t have an income, he\u2019s 28 and still lives with my Dad, and has terrible credit, and tons of medical bills.) My fear was that he would use the property as a place to stay disproportionately to his 50%, or not be able to pay for 50% of the upkeep related to it. I did however express that I would invite him to visit as a guest, but I just wasn\u2019t interested in co-owning.\n\nHe said that if my wishes were to buy it, he\u2019d want 60% of the fair market value for his 50%, which I think is unreasonable. He believes we could sell the property for more than $700k, which I agree is certainly a possibility although unlikely. Even if I sold for more than $700k, we\u2019d also probably spend 6+% on real estate commission, plus the additional expenses associated with it sitting on the market (taxes, utilities, etc.). Unless we found a buyer to pay more than $50k over appraised value, I think that my brother walks away with the most cash in the scenario of me buying it.\n\nFast forward; I have a pre-approval letter for $350,000 financing. I learned from my estate lawyer that because my brother is an heir to the proceeds of this property, and that I\u2019m simultaneously the executor of the estate and a third party buyer that I can just proceed with the purchase price of $350,000 from the estate. He doesn\u2019t really have a say in the sale price as long as it\u2019s the appraised value or higher. My lawyer advised that if he feels entitled to more, he\u2019d have to take the estate to court over it, and he\u2019d lose 99% of the time.\n\nMy brother has also been spreading slander to the rest of our family; stating that I\u2019m spending all the money in the estate checking account and that I\u2019m \u201cshady\u201d and probably paying off my primary house\u2019s mortgage with the estates money.. (100% not true, and also illegal).\n\nIf I proceed with the sale of the house to myself without my brother being happy about it, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692122614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rzx1d/aita_for_purchasing_a_property_that_was_left_to/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to cut that brother out of your life. Life is short enough to deal with such negativity. But if you feel like you have to defend yourself then stick to the truth. Point out that your brother has no job, no savings, and no means of paying for 50% of the upkeep and taxes on the house and that as executor of the will you are actually following your aunt's wishes because she had said she wished for you to have the home outright but that the will was never updated to reflect this.

You're doing everything by the book and there's no scenario where he gets the 100% of the house he wants without him really screwing you over because he can't afford it.\n\nCo-ownership with someone you're not married to is an absolute nightmare, because usually the tenants in common default (I'm assuming you're in the US here) does technically give him the rights to occupy the whole thing whenever he wants, so long as he doesn't exclude you. Imagine trying to negotiate a 50/50 split on things with him. No thanks. Doesn't sound like he could afford to buy 50% of it out of the estate either, so it was never really an option and he's just delusional that it was ever on the table. Also, you're basically giving him $350K he never had to earn free and clear to buy him out of his 50%. That's more money than he's ever going to see in his life if he keeps up not having income and living with his parents.\n\nKeep your papers tidy and your nose clean, OP.

But buying a property doesn't work on the premise of \"technically this is the same result.\" If OP is a 3rd party buyer, OP has to provide a downpayment + financing to cover the ENTIRE cost at the time of sale.", "Yes ok that\u2019s fair. But it also depends a lot on the state laws for how ownership and estates etc operate", "Then OP can please clarify.", "My lender is treating this financing as a refinance; I will have 50% equity from my inherited half and I only need $350k to buy the rest of the house from the estate.", "Edited to YTA.\n\n~~I won't venture a judgement.~~  But it seems ethically wrong for OP to take advantage of his/her position as executor NOT to put the house on the market.  OP has a conflict of interest since OP as executor should be trying to realise as much as possible for the beneficiaries.  Not doing so means they are doing their brother out of the possibility of 50% of any uplift.  \n\nI take OP's point about the associated costs of holding on to the house during the selling period, plus commission.  So a fair way forward would be to put the house on the market, and as long as the top offer was over OP's $750k ($700k plus extra costs), for OP to match the top offer plus \u00a31.  \n\nThis is how the different courses of action play out.\n\nScenario 1 - OP matches the paper valuation & buys house for $700k.  **Brother gets $350k.**\n\nScenario 2 - They put it up for sale and don't get an offer in excess of $750k.  Once $50k commission & utilities are taken into account, the net gain would be less than $700k.  They therefore revert to Scenario 1.  **Brother gets $350k.**\n\nScenario 3 - They put it up for sale and get a top offer from an outside party of (say) $760k.  Instead of OP buying the property, they go ahead with selling it externally.  The net gain (after OP's estimate of $50k commission & utilities) is $710k.  **Brother gets $355k.**\n\nScenario 4 - OP matches the $760k plus $1, to make theirs the top offer.  The estate won't have to pay realtor's commission (since it's not a sale to an outside party - I think), so the only cost to the estate is \\~$10k of utility costs.  The net gain is $750k, and **brother gets $375k**.  OP pays brother $350k from their pre-approved finance & will have to find another $25k to total the $375k due to the brother.  If OP can't afford that, then they will have to revert to Scenario 3, in which brother gets $355k. \n\nOnly Scenario 4 fulfils the executor's duty to maximise the realised value of the assets.  I'm a little suspicious of the lawyer's advice to OP: it seems to be saying, \"well, you *could* sell at the paper valuation you have, even though you aren't acting to maximise the value of the assets.  Your brother's only recourse would be to sue you.\"  In some circumstances, that might be reasonable, but the kicker for me is that the lawyer ignores the point that OP - rather than the borther - is going to benefit from this route.  It's the conflict of interest that (after I've typed all this out) makes me think that OP is YTA.", "NTA. You are absolutely right about what would happen if the two of you co-owned the property. He would end up living in it and you would end up paying the bills. \n\nChange the locks!", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif it is sold on the free market, you an get more than appraisal value.

Meaning: YOur lawyer can't tell, but it is likely you will win. 99% is: Pretty sure, but no guaranties. And **you will know who won after years, and after wasting a good part of the house value. Giving him 10% over appraisal is cheap in comparison.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you want this to be over fast, simply be fair: Set a price, and let HIM decide to buy or sell at that price.

If he keeps this up look into collecting the fee", "NTA but I would suggest selling to a third party( you hire and that represents you unknowingly to your brother and with his full agreement) instead.\n\n This way he can't ask for more than Market value and he needs to sign - make him sign - that he agreed.", "NTA but I would suggest selling to a third party( you hire and that represents you unknowingly to your brother and with his full agreement) instead.\n\n This way he can't ask for more than Market value and he needs to sign - make him sign - that he agreed.", "NTA.  By buying out his half in this manner he will actually end up with more money as there will be no Realtor commission to pay.", "YTA for the way you\u2019re going about it.  Things can go over appraisal. Can you put it on the market and see what kind of offers you get, and match that price (or that price less the fees you would have incurred).\n\nUnilaterally doing things that are against your brother\u2019s interest would make you TA.", "Unpopular opinion perhaps but I would try to wrangle your brother down to 400 k and just sell it to him.", "I would get it if he's charging his brother a premium to avoid it hitting the market. Like \"you can list it and give me 50%, or buy me out at 60%\", but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "It isn't all legal, at least not the way OP is describing it. OP is cutting some corners and exposing themselves to legal action (that his brother likely can't afford to pursue right now)", "It's a $700k house.  OP is spending $350k to buy half the house.  He already owns the other half.  \n\nWhere are you getting half of a half from?  That would be $175k.", "So the OP should take out a loan of $700K, pay half to the brother, and half to himself? Or should he just do the subtraction first, and pay his brother $350K?", "Appraised value does not equal market value, and comps even going back 3 mobths to May may not be entirely accurate. I'd say you'd be a small AH for doing what you are suggesting. \n\nBut self dealing like this seems suspect and certainly opens you up to an a lawsuit with your brother. It would seem better to work it out with him if you want to retain the property wholely or sell it to an actual third party and move on to a new property to buy with your wife.", "I don\u2019t think you are wrong about the finances but, given the perceived potential for conflict of interest in your dual roles, it is going to be hard to accomplish what you want cleanly if your brother resists.\n\nYou may have to put a value on how much the sentimental value means to you. For example, what if you offered to give him what his proceeds would be if the property sold for $800,000 with a realtor?\n\nBy my figuring that would be a $48,000 realtor fee leaving the total proceeds at 752,000 and his share would be 376,000, which is $26,000 more than your plan. Is guaranteeing you keep the house worth $26,000 to you?", "But his brother doesn't own 50% of it. His brother owns 0%, just like OP. The estate owns 100% and needs to be made whole.", "Yes, but that's not what he's proposing. He's proposing buying his brother out for $350k. That only works if his brother is a co-owner.  OP is trying to cut corners. If he did want to go this route without actually listing it to the public, he would need to cut a $700k check to the estate and then that would get split between him and his brother. \n\nI'm guessing OP couldn't get approved for $700k, but he's opening up a legal can of worms here.", "Yeah, but the 50% he would get would be of the actual sale price, not the current appraisal price. What the brother is saying is that they believe the actual sale price will be higher and therefore he wants 50% of that. He believes the actual sale price will be around 120% of the appraisal price, and he could be right.", "Wasn\u2019t clear in his post. Still he\u2019s TA for selling himself the house at appraisal value when it would most likely get a lot more on the open market.", "Or he could list it and sell it on the open market and max out its value all while doing his fiduciary duty. Might cost him more, but hey.", "But you can't negotiate a situation that already has a legal avenue to go down without your involvement.", "\nThe post was pretty clear and even included numbers.  \n\nThe point of appraisal value is to approximate the market.  \n\nAre you thinking of the tax assessment?  That's usually lower.  \n\nValue appraisal and tax appraisal are different.", "Would it get a lot more? What\u2019s your evidence for that? Are you more familiar cape cod real estate than the appraiser? \n\n\nIs it going to be significantly more? Enough to cover the 6% real estate fee and the cost of taxes, mortgage, and movers to clear out the property, and cleaners, and maintenance for 1-6 months while it is being sold? \n\n\nEasily could be saving over $50k by not selling it on the market", "> Her will was written in 2015 and stated for the property to be \u201csold and the proceeds split\u201d", "Not necessarily.  The market has cooled quite a bit.  Unless there\u2019s a bidding war situation in that particular market, getting more than the appraisal value is not likely.  If the home hasn\u2019t been updated in a while, that\u2019s even less likely. Banks won\u2019t lend for more than appraisal and buyers have to make up that difference\u2026so again, you\u2019d have to wait for a buyer who can do that.  Again no guarantee that would happen.  Then there are realtor fees and closing costs. Realtor fees on $700k will be around $42k and closing costs will between $14k and $42k depending on what the seller agrees to pay.  So they would have to get a minimum of $52k above appraisal to even get an even split of $350k.  That\u2019s not even considering the overhead of utilities and upkeep while the house is on the market.", "I don't think it's a violation of fiduciary if he spares the estate closing costs like commissions and such and still buys it at appraisal value. The dude has a lawyer, so if the lawyer says it's okay, it probably is. And there's also the fact that there are issues with selling over appraisal value if the buyer, I'm presuming a third party, just doesn't have that extra money to make up the difference between their mortgage and the price at closing. That's assuming that he could get an offer over appraisal value, which isn't the easiest thing to do, even in hot real estate markets, unless the location is very desirable and the house is in tip-top shape.", "Sure you can, the other side can just refuse to engage.", "So OP should have to compete with the open market to purchase the house. Either way it is scummy.", "My dads house sold way over appraisal. Probably legal to sell to himself at appraisal value, but he\u2019d be benefiting by paying less (potentially/most likely), and screwing his bro, which would make him the asshole.", "That's not really negotiating.  That's just crazy shouting while everyone else ignores you.", "Seller closing costs can be 6-10% of the price. So if you're selling at $800K (very idealistic, most houses do sell close to appraisal value), that's $48-80K. Leaving them with proceeds of $725-752K. They basically break even if they get lucky and sell that much over the appraisal value *and* have low closing costs. It's literally more lucrative for everyone involved to have OP buy his other brother out at appraisal value.", "You don't have an inherited half, you have a claim on half of the sale value of the house. \n\nYou need to buy *all* of the house from the estate. \n\nDid your lawyer really sign off on this, or did just your lender?", "Both the lender and the estate lawyer, actually."]}
