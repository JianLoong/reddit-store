Over the years I have given her about $18,000 to keep her and her kids alive. I invited her and her kids to come live with me rent free and was looking forward to getting a family out of it since I always wanted to have kids but never did what with career and stuff. I figured I could get a free family without having to go through all the dating and proposings. I am kind of asexual and can't fufill certain expectations.\r  \n\r  \nI got a message from my biological dad, (I did not grow up in the same house with either my father or half-sister), and my bio dad basically accused me of disability fraud. Before I had sent a picture of some paperwork  that I got from Veterans Affairs. I had added my sisters kids as dependents. The VA gave me about $650 for this and another $135 for the month of December. My bio dad starts sending me messages trying to basically bully me into giving all the money to my half-sister, who left my house to go travel and live with her aunt \u201ctemporarily\u201d and has probably abandoned me for Christmas. She basically left the house while I was asleep the day after I asked her to take more responsibility for her life.\r  \n\r  \nI figured that since I have given her 18K over the years I should be able to keep the $650 the VA gave me. She basically says that I am the one being stingy because everything she does she does for her kids. I point out that no one forced her to have 6 kids that she could not afford and that isn't my problem. I sent her $135.05 because that is the exact amount the VA gave me for December (after sending her $81 a week before for her kids medication).  She says that everything she does if for her kids but won't stay in one place and constantly chooses abusive men. She either drives good men away with chaos/disaster or moves in with predators. I managed to get her to leave her boyfriend who was beating her only for her to run off to a guys house then run off to another state to \u201cprocess her trauma\u201d and stay wither her aunt. Of course I don't know if she is actually staying with her aunt because she has lied before and I heard a man's voice in the background when I called.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason I think I am probably the A-hole is because I totally blew up at both of them and accused them of being selfish one-sided A-holes.

You actually have committed fraud. Those kids lived with you for a few weeks they are not your actual dependents. You have no legal claim. Also it\u2019s gross to try to exploit your sister\u2019s obvious mental health and addiction issues to get a pre-made family. \n\nShe and your dad suck because nobody is entitled to fraudulently obtained money", "Just a quick question: Did her children actually move in with you and, if so, are they still with you now? I don't think you're an AH for freaking out about your bio dad threatening to accuse you of fraud if the kids left unexpectedly.  On the other hand if you're claiming money for children that aren't living with you then he's not wrong.  You might feel justified in keeping that money to offset what you've given your sister over the years but legally that's not the case. So you're NTA for freaking out, but maybe the title of your post should be 'AITA for accidentally committing benefit fraud'.", "A little bit YTA. Plus I am fairly sure, you don\u2019t just get to add her kids as your dependents because she owes you money. So you did commit fraud.", "NTA - it sounds like you\u2019ve tried to help your sister, who\u2019s taken advantage of every single person around her. Your family is enabling her and now guilt tripping you into enabling her even more. If you\u2019re still watching her kids, that money needs to stay with you for their care.", "I\u2019m confused. Where are the kids currently living? Are they living with you or did they leave with their Mom? The answer to this question is the determining factor.", "NTA. You tried to be there for your sister & her kids in a big way, but she left. You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA but you\u2019re an idiot for trying to help out family and wasting money on them too this is why focusing on yourself takes you farther in life than helping a family member who\u2019s a damn leach. Block both your father and that terrible excuse for a mother because those aren\u2019t the type of people you want in your life and idgaf if she has mental health problems she needs to work on getting better and going to therapy you can\u2019t force someone with mental health issues to get help if they don\u2019t want it especially a drug addict ( I have depression and bipolar disorder 2 so I\u2019d yall wanna come at me for not being understanding of mental health problems then you can f right off because I self educate so ik im not ignorant on this topic unlike a lot of yall talking rn) stop helping people who don\u2019t deserve your time or energy at all because they don\u2019t appreciate it", "This story is very hard to follow, but you all sound like train wrecks \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Don\u2019t even tell them you filed the paperwork to stop claiming the kids. Just sit back and see how they treat you. They sound ungrateful af. She does too.
