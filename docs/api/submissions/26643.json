I have 1 brother (32) and 2 sisters (27) & (25) they cannot have children because of health and hormonal problems.\n\nSo I've imagined being a mother my whole life & how much I'd change as a person when I have children and how much I'd love to just be a mother & so years pass and here I was thinking I couldn't have children, until I met my partner  and 2 years in we have our 1st, my family practically took over being her mum so I didn't get to raise her like I wanted to and dreamt of, me and my partner split up and get back together 6months later and 3 years later we have our second and I've moved out of home in with my partner, they try and do the same with our second child but I didn't allow it to happen that time.\n The same with our third but this time after I give birth my mother (59) asks me if I can give my 3rd child to one of my siblings, she then proceeds to ask me if I can have one for each of my siblings I proceed to say no as my family still after all this time don't get along with my partner, these are our children our blood that we will have to give away.\n So I'd have to get pregnant from my partner have our kids in my belly for 9months and then give the children away to my siblings! My mother says I'm being selfish and unreasonable and I should be thinking about my siblings that can't have children over my partner that no one gets along with and my feelings about this.\n So AITA for not wanting to have kids for my siblings?", "created_utc": 1694404312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fl4g6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_have_children_for_my/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who the fuck asks a mother to give away her children? It's sad your sisters can't get pregnant but they can try IVF or adopt.", "Oh my gosh this is crazy!!! These aren\u2019t puppies they are children! Of course you can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s insane. You\u2019re not a baby making machine. How would she expect you to pass out babies as soon as they are ready like door prizes to your siblings?? Does your mother understand you wouldn\u2019t ever want to be a part of this? So many reasons. Your body, your time, your kids seeing babies growing in their mommy\u2019s tummy but don\u2019t get a sibling, you seeing your kids all of the time but being raised by your sibs, this is ridiculous that she could entertain this idea. She\u2019s off her rocker.", "NTA. Your mom is selfish and unreasonable. If your siblings know about this they're also selfish and unreasonable. Go no contact", "NTA. Holy shit cuckoo family, and not the asshole at all.", "Tell your mother to be their surrogate. That should quieten her down.", "Hi, My mother did not ask me, she more Told me to have children for my siblings. I will not give in, it's crazy if she thinks I will keep my babies in my womb for 9months and then just watch my siblings raise them like their own, I will not stand for it.", "NTA - what they\u2019re asking is selfish and unreasonable.

She needs help.", "Nta. Pregnancy is so hard on the body not to mention the attachment to babies before they\u2019re even born.", "NTA. It would be one thing to ask you to be a surrogate using donor eggs and sperm (and you\u2019d still have every right to say no), but to ask you to give away one of your children is next level and then some.", "OP just when you think people have posted most everything here on Reddit, you come up with this.  I mean, your birth mother takes the crown for entitlement, and I'll be happy to give her a sash with \"Queen of Entitlement\" so she can wear it all proudly.  This is why therapists stay in business.", "What the hell???\n\nCut the contact and Run away! Get an rs their psycho", "NTA, your family sounds nuts!", "NTA. I\u2019m horrified and disgusted on your behalf!! If your siblings can\u2019t have kids & want them they need to find a surrogate (and not you!) or adopt. \n\nIt is not your place to fix their situation. As for parenting your kids it is going to be difficult but you need to put your foot down and say no. Tell them if they can\u2019t you will go no contact. You have to follow through though. Personally I would cut them out for a couple of months, say until Christmas time and ask if they would like to try again or should you continue. I only suggest this if you are close and would rather have them around with the exception of the children. I had a fight and didn\u2019t talk to my brother for a few years. It about killed me. \n\nTell everyone the answer to being the source for kids is a no and you will not discuss it further. Ignore any future talk about it other than to repeat you have told them you will not discuss it and the topic is closed.", "Your mum is selfish too", "NTA.\n\nIts not your job to be a baby factory.

Either way, SAY NO.  Your mom is being awful.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a birthing machine for your siblings! What the hell is this mentality", "NTA- Have they heard of Adoption?? There are many children who need good loving homes, they could look into that!", "Your mother is fuckin bonkers.

Adopting will make life less shittier for 3 children and your three siblings can enjoy parenthood.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "Nta your sister and brother can adopt if they are willing to have a child that isn\u2019t biologically there\u2019s.

Youre not some breeding machine for your siblings. Too bad for them. They should just adopt or ivf or even get a surrogate or something. \n\nPs: kids arent puppies, kitties, bunnies etc that you dont just freely give away. (Not like you should do that also with animals in general but thats the point)\n\nBased on experience, my dad\u2019s aunt wanted my mom to give her kid and his wife my littlest sister years ago (just coz she has one  small eye and big eye-not exactly a deformity but appearance wise it doesnt make a big impact) bec theyre infertile. And my dad said this isnt a puppy that you can just give away to someone. \n\nTake note its a child and doing this can mess them up big time.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be comfortable having my children around them at all after these comments!! Absolutely terrifying!!", "NTA For one thing, your mom has serious issues asking you to give your child to your sibling. Then, ask you to have a baby for each of them. As you know, pregnancy isn't always easy, and you could die in childbirth. Asking someone to do that is extremely selfish. Why can't they adopt. I am just flabbergasted that your mom could even think of asking  you to give away your child. Please have her seek therapy.", "Your siblings can adopt. This is just all so wrong! WTF NTA", "NTA.  I'd go NC with them to be honest.", "NTA, you aren't the family breeder. Your mother is being gross and entitled and just.... wrong. The fact that they took over caring for your first born is enough to be annoyed and angry about their treatment of you, but then to add onto that, your mother just thinks you should give your children away to your siblings?? That's messed up. Your mother sounds like a lunatic and I would be very careful about allowing her access to your children because if she is unhinged enough to ask you to give your kids away, who knows what she thinks is acceptable!", "NTA\u2026I\u2019d move as faaaaar away as possible. That request is utterly bananas.", "WHAT?!!!\n\nMost definitely NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve even been asked this!", "NTA. \nThis is one messed up family. Why are you still in contact with them???", "NTA- I think you need to go low contact/ no contact with family if they are treating you bad because you won't give them you children.\n\nDo not give your family your children. Do not even remotely think you are the A here.  You are not. \n\nI hope you are in a position to be able to not rely on your family.", "Wow big NTA", "There are non family surrogates out there and plenty of kids to foster or adopt.

If it's a normal things to ask to her daugther she should have no problem to assume everything in public. \n\n\nBy the way, they are completly insane you are not a dog. I m chocked", "NTA and your mother is insane. Run, run far away as you may find your kids gone one day, because they have been distributed to your siblings.

She should be with you and her siblings.", "These people absolutely shouldn't be adopting if they think a child is a possession. Adopted children have biological family and significant trauma from being separated from them.

The mother/grandmother should be able to have babies for them all.", "Go no contact with them all and get a restraining order against you mom if you can.", "Has your mother always been unhinged? Are your siblings involved in the pressure at all? Do they think this is acceptable to ask of you? The way she demanded this of you is abusive and utterly insane. Don't for a second let her gaslight you into believing that you could possibly be an AH in this situation. If your siblings want children so badly, there are plenty of other options for them other than treating you like livestock... a breeder. I'm floored that anyone would even consider this as an option. For your own sake, you should take a break from contact with your mother. You don't deserve to be treated in such a way, and your family doesn't deserve to have you in their lives if these are the types of expectations they have of you.

What I meant is that any sane person would think about adoption first and not asking their relative to give them her baby."]}
