My mother says I'm being selfish and unreasonable and I should be thinking about my siblings that can't have children over my partner that no one gets along with and my feelings about this.\n So AITA for not wanting to have kids for my siblings?", "created_utc": 1694404312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fl4g6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_have_children_for_my/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As for parenting your kids it is going to be difficult but you need to put your foot down and say no. Tell them if they can\u2019t you will go no contact. You have to follow through though.
