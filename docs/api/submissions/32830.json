{"id": 32830, "submission_id": "18g1se7", "title": "AITA for disinviting my BIL from Christmas because he keeps telling my son to call me by my first name?", "selftext": "My husband has 3 brothers. Charlie and Mike are in their 30s, while Spencer is 5 years old. Spencer is their half-brother from their dad\u2019s second marriage. Their father passed away shortly after Spencer was born.\n\n2 years ago, Spencer\u2019s mother went to prison. My husband and I began fostering him. It didn\u2019t take long for him to actually feel like our son. As it was, my husband and Spencer didn\u2019t have a very brotherly relationship given the 30 year age gap. He already was more of an uncle. 6 months ago, Spencer\u2019s mom lost her parental rights. My husband and I have been working on adopting him. It should be finalized after Christmas! Spencer is so excited. He\u2019s been calling us mama and daddy for a little over a year now, so this is just basically all legal, not changing how we feel in our hearts.\n\nCharlie and Mike have been supportive of the whole ordeal for the most part, but we\u2019ve faced a road bump recently. When Spencer began calling us mama and daddy, Charlie found it odd. He said that we weren\u2019t his parents. I said legally, yes we are. I said he doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cUncle Charlie\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want to be, but we are raising him. Charlie says that we\u2019re basically erasing their dad from Spencer\u2019s life. I said no, we talk about him AND Spencer\u2019s bio mom often. This won\u2019t be a secret. As it is, Spencer is very smart and is aware that he only came to live with us 2 years ago. Mike and my husband have both told Charlie to let it go.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed, however, that when talking to Spencer, he refers to me and my husband by our first names. Or he\u2019ll say \u201cask your brother\u201d, referring to my husband, or \u201cgo show your sister-in-law\u201d when referring to me. Spencer is confused because he knows my husband is his brother but he doesn\u2019t look at him like that. We\u2019ve tried talking to him about it but Charlie claimed \u201cit\u2019s force of habit\u201d. \n\nWe were trying to let it go but then one day, Charlie corrected Spencer when he called me \u201cmama\u201d and said \u201cno, that\u2019s Kate\u201d. Spencer got confused and said \u201cno, that\u2019s mama!\u201d Charlie told him that I\u2019m not his mother. This only upset Spencer further. \n\nI\u2019ve had enough, frankly. Spencer is our son. We have him in therapy and have also asked Charlie and Mike to attend family therapy with us. Only Mike has agreed. I told my husband that I don\u2019t want Charlie at Christmas (we\u2019re hosting) if he\u2019s just going to upset Spencer and undermine our place as his parents. My husband said it\u2019s completely up to me. So, I told Charlie either he stops correcting Spencer or he can\u2019t come.\n\nNow, Charlie is mad and says I\u2019m keeping his brothers from him at Christmas. I said if my husband wants, he can go visit him. And if he wants to see Spencer, he can promise to stop undermining my place. Charlie called me dramatic. \n\nMIL wants all of her boys at Christmas and says that I can put up with it for just one day. She said it\u2019s hard for her to be around Spencer but she does it for us, so I can put up with Charlie and \u201csee his side\u201d. AITA?\n\nEDIT: To add, my husband has been advocating for Spencer and does stand up to his family. It\u2019s not just me.

The only one who clearly has a problem with this arrangement is Charlie and I'd start to question what is real issue is. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Charlie isn't slipping up. This isn't a habit. He's doing it deliberately. And since he won't stop, he loses the privilege of coming to your home. If your MIL doesn't like it, she can host him at her house.

You\u2019re doing all the right things in a situation that was decidedly fairly terrible and moving forward by making it official. You, your husband, and, most importantly, Spencer are all excited. Charlie is not.\n\nThere could be a dozen reasons why he\u2019s acting this way, none of them are healthy to expose Spencer or yourselves to. This is not \u201cforce of habit\u201d, it is purposeful alienation and it\u2019s going to bite him in the rear in a few years when Spencer hates him for it. IMO, I wouldn\u2019t allow contact at all until you figure out why Charlie is actually doing this and then proceed from there, regardless of MIL\u2019s woe is me act", "NTA. \n\nWhat your husband and you did for Spencer is admirable! Kudos to you for giving him a loving home. Since you're legally adopting him, you are, in fact, his mom and dad.

He's trying to insert his own resentments into the mix and that's clearly not in Spencer's best interest. If he felt that strongly about it, he could have sat down with you and your husband to have an adult conversation. You don't walk into someone's home and start trying to change how they raise their kid. You did the right thing by offering Charlie a choice. If MIL has a problem with that, tell her it's Charlie's choice and he's making it himself.", "Why are family members so quick to dismiss the wishes of the parents.\n\nIf Charlie wants to teach him, he should have adopted Spencer but as it stands, it is simply not his place.\n\nStick to your guns and tell your husband he needs to back you up.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your household. Your rules. Charlie doesn't get to override what your husband and you agree on. Spencer is a smart boy and your husband and you have been honest from the start about his parents. You aren't erasing his parent's memories at all. You then decided to go to family therapy and Charlie declined. Charlie doesn't get to make the transition and healing moment harder for his nephew and if he is beginning to argue with your son I would not have him around Spencer. MIL needs to get on board because it isn't about her. She can be disinvited if it's too much for her. Your husband and Mike support you, so they need to show it. Your man can't say it's on you and up to you, that isn't a united front and he should be communicating and laying down the law to his brother.", "Telling a 5-year-old to 'go see your sister in law' is not 'force of habit'. Charlie is being very purposeful and his excuses like this also make him deceptive. I think your instinct and boundaries with him are perfectly reasonable and appropriate. Let Charlie be mad. He brought this on himself. NTA\n\nBut I feel you need more support. You shouldn't he handing down this rule solo, your husband should be leading the charge and the communications because it is his brother who is misbehaving and causing problems. Same with handling the MIL (hubby needs to handle her). She can host 'her boys' if she wants to and it doesn't have to involve you being around someone who consciously and constantly undermines the hard work you've put into raising Spencer. \n\nCharlie doesn't have 'a side' in this. He's just inserting himself into something that doesn't really have all that much to do with him, and he isn't doing even the bare minimum to contribute to the situation becoming resolved. You don't need to accommodate that but you also shouldn't have to be under extra pressure from others to play nice. Ask your husband to step up.", "NTA\n\nCharlie is being cruel to you and Spencer. If it's something Spencer wants to talk about when he's older it would be different, but right now Spencer wants to have a mummy and a daddy.\n\n>MIL wants all of her boys at Christmas\n\nSince Spencer is not one of \"her boys\", perhaps the older brothers can all visit their mother's house after Spencer's bedtime?", "NTA - I\u2019d die on this hill.

There's no side to see- you took in this child, you love this child, this child loves you and sees you as his parents.", "The problem is that Charlie is doing something that makes Spencer feel confused and uncertain. That's not ok.

I can't imagine how upsetting it is to your son to be told \"that's not your mom.\" It is confusing, it is mean, it is traumatizing to a child in any situation, worse when a child hasn't had a stable home. \n\nAnd the fact that MIL is saying she puts up with Spencer, so you should put up with this...even more troubling! What are these people saying to Spencer when you aren't around? Your husband shouldn't just be leaving this up to you, but should be actively upset that his family is acting this way.

Well, let's make it easy on her and let her know her presence isn't mandatory so you will mark her off the list of those who are coming for Christmas.\n\nBoth Charlie and your MIL are selfish people. Anyone who would put their wants over the best interests of a child do not deserve to be mollycoddled. It's time they both make a decision - accept what is happening, or be shut out.

He\u2019s small - he\u2019ll hardly have memories of his biological father and mother and he\u2019s FIVE, it\u2019s confusing to him to be thinking you\u2019re his parents and his birth parents are his parents. As long as you keep telling him about his birth parents and reminding him that these are \u201cDaddy X\u201d (who is also his daddy\u2019s father) and \u201cmommy X\u201d I think it\u2019s fine. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be okay for you to erase his birth parents by never talking about them or not having any images of them. \n\nAnd cautiously, I\u2019m also going to risk with downvotes but say that - yea, he is calling you mommy and daddy, but he is also FIVE. Five year olds don\u2019t preach gospel yet and adults are the ones who make the decisions. I understand, OP, based on your comments below your desire to be a mother, especially as you\u2019re unable to biologically to have a child without assistance, but I would approach it veeeery carefully how you frame Spencer calling you their parents, because it CAN indeed look like you\u2019re alienating him from his birth parents memories. \n\nI also don\u2019t think the brother is an AH for having his opinion. I have siblings and I\u2019d feel weird if they called me their mommy instead of their mother their mommy. That\u2019s his frame of reference and he is allowed to have such. \n\nHe may be confusing Spencer and you need to talk it out with him, in private, but the reality is also that your son had two parents, one of whom died and his memory, at least, should not be relegated to \u201che gave you life and then he died\u201d. At the same time, it also shouldn\u2019t become Spencer\u2019s ball and chain - he is his own person. I\u2019d suggest maybe including a childhood therapist who can help you navigate this - who can help you in talking to Spencer in a way that he understands that he has both you as mommy and daddy, but he also has daddy X and mommy X. \n\nMaybe the brother would also acquiesce if you started calling Spencer\u2019s birth father as \u201cdaddy [insert name]\u201d - that way the phrase \u201cdaddy\u201d is still there.", "Yes - get over yourself", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Charlie and Mike are in their 30s, while Spencer is 5 years old. Spencer is their half-brother from their dad\u2019s second marriage. Their father passed away shortly after Spencer was born.\n\n2 years ago, Spencer\u2019s mother went to prison. My husband and I began fostering him. It didn\u2019t take long for him to actually feel like our son. As it was, my husband and Spencer didn\u2019t have a very brotherly relationship given the 30 year age gap. He already was more of an uncle. 6 months ago, Spencer\u2019s mom lost her parental rights. My husband and I have been working on adopting him. It should be finalized after Christmas! Spencer is so excited. He\u2019s been calling us mama and daddy for a little over a year now, so this is just basically all legal, not how we feel in our hearts.\n\nCharlie and Mike have been supportive of the whole ordeal for the most part, but we\u2019ve faced a road bump recently. When Spencer began calling us mama and daddy, Charlie found it odd. He said that we weren\u2019t his parents. I said legally, yes we are. I said he doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cUncle Charlie\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want to be, but we are raising him. Charlie says that we\u2019re basically erasing their dad from Spencer\u2019s life. I said no, we talk about him AND Spencer\u2019s bio mom often. This won\u2019t be a secret. As it is, Spencer is very smart and is aware that he only came to live with us 2 years ago. Mike and my husband have both told Charlie to let it go.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed, however, that when talking to Spencer, he refers to me and my husband by our first names. Or he\u2019ll say \u201cask your brother\u201d, referring to my husband, or \u201cgo show your sister-in-law\u201d when referring to me. Spencer is confused because he knows my husband is his brother but he doesn\u2019t look at him like that. We\u2019ve tried talking to him about it but Charlie claimed \u201cit\u2019s force of habit\u201d. \n\nWe were trying to let it go but then one day, Charlie corrected Spencer when he called me \u201cmama\u201d and said \u201cno, that\u2019s Kate\u201d. Spencer got confused and said \u201cno, that\u2019s mama!\u201d Charlie told him that I\u2019m not his mother. This only upset Spencer further. \n\nI\u2019ve had enough, frankly. Spencer is our son. We have him in therapy and have also asked Charlie and Mike to attend family therapy with us. Only Mike has agreed. I told my husband that I don\u2019t want Charlie at Christmas (we\u2019re hosting) if he\u2019s just going to upset Spencer and undermine our place as his parents. My husband said it\u2019s completely up to me. So, I told Charlie either he stops correcting Spencer or he can\u2019t come.\n\nNow, Charlie is mad and says I\u2019m keeping his brothers from him at Christmas. I said if my husband wants, he can go visit him. And if he wants to see Spencer, he can promise to stop undermining my place. Charlie called me dramatic. \n\nMIL wants all of her boys at Christmas and says that I can put up with it for just one day. She said it\u2019s hard for her to be around Spencer but she does it for us, so I can put up with Charlie and \u201csee his side\u201d.

She is a grown up and will need to figure her stuff out in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt your child", "So is Charlie really trying to preserve Spencer's memory of his father, or is he trying to punish Spencer because his father hurt his mother?", "With all politeness and respect for the woman who went through a divorce from her husband, I don't give a shit what happened with the divorce. That child had nothing to do with it, none of it was his fault. It is completely unacceptable to treat a 5yo this way for his parents actions", "I don't want to overly excuse MIL's behavior here but it has to be really humiliating to be the old wife traded in for the new model. Obviously I don't know the specifics of this family but history is littered with women thrown away after they've sacrificed careers, hobbies, and their own physical welfare to raise children and support a husband, who then get cast aside when Dad has a mid-life crisis and decides she's not perky and young enough. The fact that dads new wife went to prison and lost her parental rights suggest that he made some...bad choices.", "No man has left his family for an affair with a women half his age? You doubling down on that?", "Well then she should have adopted him and made him her actual son instead of making you jump through hoops for her", "I stand corrected. Thought it was a bone apple tea. TIL a new word.", "I don't think they were trying to be rude.", "I am glad she is trying to sort her feelings out. Tbf, as long she is kind to him I think it is a win for everybody. \n\nSpencer is lucky to have you all!", "I\u2019m glad she is sorting her feelings but I would be cautious on saying that that is a grandma relationship. She may never feel that way about him even if she treats Spencer kindly. I may follow her lead on what Spencer calls her, etc.", "He might feel like ultimately you guys are making him look bad because you didn't just take in your husband's little brother, you made room for him in your family as if he is one of your children. I can't really say why psychologically that would trigger Charlie but I'm guessing it is. You certainly shouldn't change anything you're doing, but it could be an explanation for why he feels he wants to disrupt the mom/dad thing.", "If Spencer didn\u2019t want to call me mom, I\u2019d be fine. I\u2019m upset because he wants to and someone is stopping him, please stop framing this as I\u2019m pushing this on him.\n\nI definitely plan to be patient. Thank you.", "It\u2019s weird\u2026to you. For this family, it works so it\u2019s not weird.", "excellent point that Charlie may have unresolved feelings about the consequences of the affair.", "It is obvious that Charlie has issues with Spencer, and is a grown man taking his ire at his own father out on a CHILD.", "Oh, I wouldn't doubt it. They are on two opposite extremes of the situation (she hates FIL and struggles with Spencer's existence vs Charlie loved his father, loves his brother and doesn't want the dynamics to change), but they definitely overlap in the area of \"this situation is weird, uncomfortable and not easy\".", "I think it's the former. It's a really long story, but the whole thing is a lot of drama. Charlie loves and misses his father. They were very close. MIL is upset at how much her sons idolize her ex and is struggling with him being apart of the family.\n\nSo, two very different extremes.", "Oh I know. I do know. But Spencer is a baby, and it's not even MIL's house - she's not even hosting. All she has to do is say she can't come due to a previous engagement. She doesn't have to pile onto a child. \n\nI do get the emotional shit, honestly I do. But OP is trying to do the right thing.", "She is becoming grandma to her son\u2019s son is a better way to look at it.", "She says she wants to have one with him. He doesn\u2019t call her grandma right now, so we\u2019re following his lead.\n\nIt\u2019s because she wants to be that role in his life, that she\u2019s talking about it in therapy.", "Sorry, I didn't mean you're forcing this. I could see that you wanted what you think is best for Spenser. It really might be so now.\n\nI just tried to tell, as gently as possible, that this might be much more complicated than your BIL not wanting you to be a mother for Spenser. You mentioned that Charlie was happy that you and your husband adopted Spenser. The issue comes with what he see as a denying your FIL's role and memory as Spenser's father. Its clear that he is still grieving and it will not be resolved in near time, so your decision to cut him off from your's family, and Spenser's, life might not what could be best for your family and Spenser. \n\nYou and Charlie both might need to have individual terrapy to help yourself to work through this.\n\nI really wish you and everyone in tgis situation the best.", "It doesn\u2019t though does it\u2026 cause there is a brother uninvited from Xmas and being prevented from seeing his other brother unless he complies with OP", "But if Spencer is 5, and Charlie is near 30, Charlie needs to get a fucking grip. He was an ADULT when Spencer was born.", "Maybe Charlie and MIL can go to therapy together?\n\nCharlie is an adult and should have enough impulse control to not cause harm to an innocent child because of his own feelings.\n\nYou say Charlie is acting like this because he doesn't want the dynamic to change. May I offer an alternative view?\n\nCharlie might be, subconsciously, really pissed off at his dad for causing this whole situation. But dad is dead and can't be held accountable. Who *is* available to act out on? Spencer. The proof of dad's infidelity and lack of care for his family, including Charlie. The affair baby is often the brunt of emotions from existing children. Just because Charlie's an adult won't stop this from applying.\n\nEvidence for this idea: Charlie is doing behaviour that is actively distressing Spencer. He's denying even the *idea* of having parents for Spencer. Charlie wants Spencer to be an orphan - for a child that's an existential crisis.\n\nCharlie is punishing Spencer. For his own anger with and grief for their dad. I wasn't kidding about going to therapy with the mom. They could probably help each other a lot.\n\nFor now: you absolutely need to, and are required to, defend your little boy from those who are willing to inflict or accept harm to him. \n\nThis includes husband's mom. She's willing to accept harm to Spencer, 'for the day.' Harm does not have a stopwatch. It happens in an instant and over time.\n\nYou are doing the right thing. You are defending the vulnerable in the only way you can. Go you! NTA.", "MIL would prefer Spencer be her son's half brother that's not related to her directly, rather than her grandson through adoption. She secretly wishes Charlie could convince you and your child to make that kind of naming the status quo.", "Oh for sure, like I said it's not an excuse. I'm just riffing on this whole family situation because I'm way early for my flight and am dicking around on the Internet to kill time.", ">She says she wants to have one with him. He doesn\u2019t call her grandma right now, so we\u2019re following his lead.\n\nThat's exactly as it should be, and that's also the case with you and your husband being mom and dad. Unless I misunderstood you, *Spencer* initiated calling you mom and dad, and you went along with it, which is great.\n\nI think it would have even been fine if you or your husband initiated it, as long as you didn't force it. Your BIL is a major AH.", "It does. The fact that one brother has a problem makes it the brother, and MIL\u2019s, problem. They are the issue, NOT OP, her husband or the other brother. He\u2019s preventing himself from seeing his family. They are not asking anything unreasonable. Being respectful cost nothing. Actively working against OP and her family will cost him everything. This isn\u2019t a difficult task. Charlie is purposefully and willfully acting this way. He had all the control and power to not.", "Ahaha! I'm on my way to bed and trauma-dumping about past experiences (in other threads) so I'm pretty riled up in general! I think I need to browse /r/CatDistributionSystem before I tuck in. xD\n\nHave a good flight! <3", "We didn\u2019t initiate it, we left it up to him. He actually asked to call me mama because he already has a mommy (his bio mom).", "So it doesn\u2019t work then\u2026", "Awesome! Someone's been cutting onions over here.", "It is so heartwarming that your family is rallying around this child who is essentially an orphan. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to whatever is going on with Charlie but he\u2019s messing with a 5 year old orphan\u2019s bonding with his adoptive family. Maybe if you put it to him straight that he\u2019s approaching cartoon villain levels, he may back off. Either way he desperately needs therapy too but unfortunately you cannot force a thirty year old to grow up. You can only protect the child you\u2019re responsible for.", "Now you\u2019re purposely being obtuse as well.  It works for OP, her husband and Spencer. The family that matters in this case."]}
