We are both happy and live in the house we bought before we got married. We are not currently trying to have a baby but we aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to getting pregnant. We have been talking about it for about a year and we both agree that we dont want wait a super long time to start trying. Last month i had felt off and had super bad morning sickness. So i decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was super excited and so was my husband. I made a dr. Appointment and when i got the bloodwork back, it was determined that i had a chemical pregnancy. I had gotten myself so worked up that i was heartbroken. We decided not to tell our families because my mother is the kind of person that thinks you should be married for at least a year before trying to have kids. So I really didnt want to get into it. \n\nA few weeks later, we had to go to the bank to get my moms name off my bank account (its been that way since i was 17) and put my husbands name on it. My mom offered to pick us up since she would be driving past our house to get to the bank. We agreed and didnt think anything of it. On the car ride there, my mom started talking about our finances. She said that we spend too much money and need to start budgeting. She says this pretty much every time we see her but this time she was getting onto my husband saying that he needs to do a better job at supporting me and suggesting that he get a second job. (Side note, he just had started a new job after being let go from a job where he made $26/hr for reasons that were not his fault.) I decided that i was not going to put up with this and it soon turned into a screaming match between me and my mom. Once it calmed down, she said \u201ci know about you OBGYN appointment. I hope you aren\u2019t pregnant \u201c. I immediately burst into tears and said \u201ci was but now im not\u201d. He response was \u201cgood. It breaks my heart to think ove you having a baby right now. You are too immature and not financially stable enough.\u201d The rest of the car ride was silent. \n\nNow, this past weekend, by brother (25 m) and his wife (24 f) who have been married for almost 3 years, announced their pregnancy and my mom was beyond excited. She was screaming, jumping up and down saying \u201cmy first grandbaby!\u201d. I acted the best I could and hugged them both and congratulated them. I excused myself to the bathroom when everyone was talking. No one was paying attention to me so i didnt think anything of it. I collected myself and went back to join the party. Everyone was still excited and happy i I assumed everything was fine. The next day, my mom calls me and proceeded to say how rude i was and that i made everyone uncomfortable and therefore stealing their spotlight. I didnt even know what to say so i just said im sorry and hung up. I havent said anything to anyone since but my mom is still texting me demanding I apologize to my brother and SIL. So am i the A-hole?\n\nEdit:: my husband was at the announcement. According to him, no one even turned around to see I wasn\u2019t there. They were all talking to each other.

It is a huge loss, it doesn't go away, you don't sulk about it, it's like having a scab ripped off repeatedly every time you think you are healing. When they called to tell us, all kudos to them - they  knew it would be painful and were sensitive - but I could not speak because their happiness just shone a bright light on how dark my loss made me feel.

Should we not throw graduation parties because there might be guests that dropped out and will have negative feelings?  Should we keep our successful jobs a secret so our unemployed friends don't find out and have their feelings hurt?  Should we expect perceived happiness from people only if we know that they have previously experienced the exact same thing?", "No we are not responsible for other\u2019s feelings. Those people are responsible for handling those emotions. We should still share our good news.
