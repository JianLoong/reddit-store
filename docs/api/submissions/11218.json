We are both happy and live in the house we bought before we got married. We are not currently trying to have a baby but we aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to getting pregnant. We have been talking about it for about a year and we both agree that we dont want wait a super long time to start trying. Last month i had felt off and had super bad morning sickness. So i decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was super excited and so was my husband. I made a dr. Appointment and when i got the bloodwork back, it was determined that i had a chemical pregnancy. I had gotten myself so worked up that i was heartbroken. We decided not to tell our families because my mother is the kind of person that thinks you should be married for at least a year before trying to have kids. So I really didnt want to get into it. \n\nA few weeks later, we had to go to the bank to get my moms name off my bank account (its been that way since i was 17) and put my husbands name on it. My mom offered to pick us up since she would be driving past our house to get to the bank. We agreed and didnt think anything of it. On the car ride there, my mom started talking about our finances. She said that we spend too much money and need to start budgeting. She says this pretty much every time we see her but this time she was getting onto my husband saying that he needs to do a better job at supporting me and suggesting that he get a second job. (Side note, he just had started a new job after being let go from a job where he made $26/hr for reasons that were not his fault.) I decided that i was not going to put up with this and it soon turned into a screaming match between me and my mom. Once it calmed down, she said \u201ci know about you OBGYN appointment. I hope you aren\u2019t pregnant \u201c. I immediately burst into tears and said \u201ci was but now im not\u201d. He response was \u201cgood. It breaks my heart to think ove you having a baby right now. You are too immature and not financially stable enough.\u201d The rest of the car ride was silent. \n\nNow, this past weekend, by brother (25 m) and his wife (24 f) who have been married for almost 3 years, announced their pregnancy and my mom was beyond excited. She was screaming, jumping up and down saying \u201cmy first grandbaby!\u201d. I acted the best I could and hugged them both and congratulated them. I excused myself to the bathroom when everyone was talking. No one was paying attention to me so i didnt think anything of it. I collected myself and went back to join the party. Everyone was still excited and happy i I assumed everything was fine. The next day, my mom calls me and proceeded to say how rude i was and that i made everyone uncomfortable and therefore stealing their spotlight. I didnt even know what to say so i just said im sorry and hung up. I havent said anything to anyone since but my mom is still texting me demanding I apologize to my brother and SIL. So am i the A-hole?\n\nEdit:: my husband was at the announcement. According to him, no one even turned around to see I wasn\u2019t there. They were all talking to each other.

Should we not throw graduation parties because there might be guests that dropped out and will have negative feelings?  Should we keep our successful jobs a secret so our unemployed friends don't find out and have their feelings hurt?  Should we expect perceived happiness from people only if we know that they have previously experienced the exact same thing?", "No we are not responsible for other\u2019s feelings. Those people are responsible for handling those emotions. We should still share our good news. However if you know someone who going through something that could cause them negative feelings give them leniency on not immediately having happy feelings for us.", "NTA. OP, I know cutting off a close family member doesn't feel as easy as it sounds when internet strangers say it, so I'm not going to tell you to do that. (But it's not a bad idea - go for it if you want but don't feel weak or whatever if you don't!) My biggest piece of advice is to please, PLEASE never take your mother's word for how anyone else feels. She has shown you that she will make everything all about her, so whenever she says \"EVERYONE is upset that you did x,\" please translate that in your head as \"I am upset that you did x, and either I am so self-centered and lacking in empathy that I genuinely believe everyone else always feels the same way I do, or I want to make you feel really bad about it and I don't think you care enough about my opinion to be sufficiently shamed by me alone.\"\n\nShe is not a reliable messenger. Nothing she tells you about anyone else is true unless you have independent evidence of it.\n\nThis is the kind of thing where truly believing it  will probably take time (and therapy), but you can start faking it till you make it by letting her know you will not act on what she tells you about other people. For example:\n\nYour mom: Your brother and SIL are so hurt that you ruined their pregnancy announcement! You need to apologize right now and single-handedly furnish their nursery to make it up to them!\n\nYou: Wow, I had no idea they felt that way. They probably need some space from me but I definitely didn't mean to hurt their feelings. I'm sure they'll reach out to me to discuss it when they're ready.\n\nHonestly, if your brother and SIL are good people and you trust them and you're willing to talk about your pregnancy loss with them, you could do what your mom says and apologize. They will probably tell you they're not upset at all and you might end up getting some support from them during a hard time for you. Obviously this could backfire by making them uncomfortable discussing pregnancy around you or excluding you from future events or who knows what. You're the expert on your family and your feelings. But my MIL is a lot like your mom, and often the quickest way for my husband to feel better when she pulls this $&!+ is to apologize directly to whoever she's using as her rage-proxy because that person is never actually mad at him.", "I do not understand why people seem to get married so young.

About an hour in, a migraine started for me and so I went to the host, thanked them but said i had to leave due to feeling ill. They were understanding and wished me well. However, for reasons having to do with it being the 80s pre cell-phone, when the taxi I'd called to take me home never showed up, I had to go back inside to try again.\n\nMy head was pounding at this point and I had the nausea going, so I tried to stay away from where the loudest noise was but work around to a phone to try again. I was spotted by some family friends who came over and I just started crying, I was in so much pain. They were comforting me and one went to get their keys, they were driving me home! and my mom comes over and, this is literally what happened:\n Grabbed me out of the arms of the comforting friend\n Took hold of both my shoulders and then did the most cartoonish look to the left, look to the right \"to see if anyone was watching\" (managing to ... ignore the person whose arms she snatched me from and the other two people standing RIGHT THERE) and then\n SHOOK ME by the shoulders screaming at the top of her lungs, \"What are you doing!? Everyone is looking at you! You are a embarassing me! Why are you crying! Stop! You are a disgrace!\"\n The conforting friend tried to get her off me, one of the other people (a man) actually got her to let go of me, I half-fainted and then started throwing up (the movement got to me) and my mother continued to shriek that I was causing a scene.\n The host himself drove me home and told me that he was very sorry for all that, sorry I had that for a mom (wry), and that he hoped I was still coming to next week's party (I was) and \"did I want him to NOT invite my mom?\" \n\nMy mother showed up at the house about two hours later, stormed into my room, and informed me that *Everyone* hated me, everyone was so embarassed by me, No one ever wanted to see me again, and the host told my mom that I was never to go to any of his parties again!\n \nLater, other friends were all telling, in tones of incredulity, how my mom started going around to people at the party to \"apologize for her daughter's behavior\" and how she now they all understood what a hard life she had being my mother with a child like that. \n\nI don't think I ever got more sympathy and kindness from a community than after that little display. \n\nAll to say, your mom has a narrative in her head that makes her the hero/star and you the bad guy and so everyone is sympathetic to her.
