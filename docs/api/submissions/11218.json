We are both happy and live in the house we bought before we got married. We are not currently trying to have a baby but we aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to getting pregnant. We have been talking about it for about a year and we both agree that we dont want wait a super long time to start trying. Last month i had felt off and had super bad morning sickness. So i decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was super excited and so was my husband. I made a dr. Appointment and when i got the bloodwork back, it was determined that i had a chemical pregnancy. I had gotten myself so worked up that i was heartbroken. We decided not to tell our families because my mother is the kind of person that thinks you should be married for at least a year before trying to have kids. So I really didnt want to get into it. \n\nA few weeks later, we had to go to the bank to get my moms name off my bank account (its been that way since i was 17) and put my husbands name on it. My mom offered to pick us up since she would be driving past our house to get to the bank. We agreed and didnt think anything of it. On the car ride there, my mom started talking about our finances. She said that we spend too much money and need to start budgeting. She says this pretty much every time we see her but this time she was getting onto my husband saying that he needs to do a better job at supporting me and suggesting that he get a second job. (Side note, he just had started a new job after being let go from a job where he made $26/hr for reasons that were not his fault.) I decided that i was not going to put up with this and it soon turned into a screaming match between me and my mom. Once it calmed down, she said \u201ci know about you OBGYN appointment. I hope you aren\u2019t pregnant \u201c. I immediately burst into tears and said \u201ci was but now im not\u201d. He response was \u201cgood. It breaks my heart to think ove you having a baby right now. You are too immature and not financially stable enough.\u201d The rest of the car ride was silent. \n\nNow, this past weekend, by brother (25 m) and his wife (24 f) who have been married for almost 3 years, announced their pregnancy and my mom was beyond excited. She was screaming, jumping up and down saying \u201cmy first grandbaby!\u201d. I acted the best I could and hugged them both and congratulated them. I excused myself to the bathroom when everyone was talking. No one was paying attention to me so i didnt think anything of it. I collected myself and went back to join the party. Everyone was still excited and happy i I assumed everything was fine. The next day, my mom calls me and proceeded to say how rude i was and that i made everyone uncomfortable and therefore stealing their spotlight. I didnt even know what to say so i just said im sorry and hung up. I havent said anything to anyone since but my mom is still texting me demanding I apologize to my brother and SIL. So am i the A-hole?\n\nEdit:: my husband was at the announcement. According to him, no one even turned around to see I wasn\u2019t there. They were all talking to each other.

Should we expect perceived happiness from people only if we know that they have previously experienced the exact same thing?", "No we are not responsible for other\u2019s feelings. Those people are responsible for handling those emotions. We should still share our good news. However if you know someone who going through something that could cause them negative feelings give them leniency on not immediately having happy feelings for us.", "NTA. OP, I know cutting off a close family member doesn't feel as easy as it sounds when internet strangers say it, so I'm not going to tell you to do that. (But it's not a bad idea - go for it if you want but don't feel weak or whatever if you don't!) My biggest piece of advice is to please, PLEASE never take your mother's word for how anyone else feels. She has shown you that she will make everything all about her, so whenever she says \"EVERYONE is upset that you did x,\" please translate that in your head as \"I am upset that you did x, and either I am so self-centered and lacking in empathy that I genuinely believe everyone else always feels the same way I do, or I want to make you feel really bad about it and I don't think you care enough about my opinion to be sufficiently shamed by me alone.\"\n\nShe is not a reliable messenger. Nothing she tells you about anyone else is true unless you have independent evidence of it.\n\nThis is the kind of thing where truly believing it  will probably take time (and therapy), but you can start faking it till you make it by letting her know you will not act on what she tells you about other people. For example:\n\nYour mom: Your brother and SIL are so hurt that you ruined their pregnancy announcement! You need to apologize right now and single-handedly furnish their nursery to make it up to them!\n\nYou: Wow, I had no idea they felt that way. They probably need some space from me but I definitely didn't mean to hurt their feelings. I'm sure they'll reach out to me to discuss it when they're ready.\n\nHonestly, if your brother and SIL are good people and you trust them and you're willing to talk about your pregnancy loss with them, you could do what your mom says and apologize. They will probably tell you they're not upset at all and you might end up getting some support from them during a hard time for you. Obviously this could backfire by making them uncomfortable discussing pregnancy around you or excluding you from future events or who knows what. You're the expert on your family and your feelings. But my MIL is a lot like your mom, and often the quickest way for my husband to feel better when she pulls this $&!+ is to apologize directly to whoever she's using as her rage-proxy because that person is never actually mad at him.", "I do not understand why people seem to get married so young. I think waiting to mature some would make it a lot easier to u understand when somebody is being an absolute asshole and tell them to shut the hell up instead of questioning if you are the asshole yourself in a situation when you've blatantly done nothing wrong. How do you advocate for your child if you can't even advocate for yourself?", "NTA AT ALL. I can't even imagine my mother speaking this way to me omg", "NTA - OP I had my first miscarriage at 19yrs old, I\u2019m sure my mum was secretly relieved because me and my now husband had only been together 2 years and were so young and so poor! But she never ever let on if that was how she felt. She cried with me, hugged me and told me how sorry she was. I\u2019m so sorry you didn\u2019t get the love and support you deserved and needed from your mum. Please don\u2019t apologise to anyone, this sounds like your mum trying to make you feel bad about not conforming to whatever plans she has in her head for you. If having a baby now is what feels right for you and your husband I wish you all the best of luck for the future, your mum can kick rocks.", "NTA honestly if your mom is this unsupportive I would be considering at least going low contact,  do let your brother know what's happened that you lost a pregnancy your mom knew and has been extremely unsupportive and explain to them why your going low contact with her for a while but want to maintain a relationship with them.", ">Edit:: my husband was at the announcement. According to him, no one even turned around to see I wasn\u2019t there. They were all talking to each other. My mom is the only one who noticed so theres that.\n\nYou realize this means your mom's actions are 100% malicious?\n\nShe was watching for your reaction. Not out of sympathy, but so she could use it to hurt you.\n\nNTA. It sounds like your mother hates you. Step away from her. Permanently.", "NTA\n\nYour mom has not made the transition in her mind to stop treating you like a child and start treating you like an adult. That is why she is constantly berating you like you are a 14 year old teenager who has not cleaned her room. \n\nYou are an adult. What is more, you are a married woman. You need to put your foot down and let your mother know that you have boundaries. It's not up to her to give up control over you. Tell her that she has no control over the decisions of you and your husband -- whether it is finances or children. And let her know that if she continues to cross those boundaries, it will not end well.", "NTA.  You may want to start distancing yourself from your mother.  What a buttinsky!", "NTA - your mom has got some nerve! Did she never have a miscarriage? Or any disappointment regarding pregnancy and family planning? I swear to god.", "Nta you left the room in order to not make a scene when you felt your emotions taking over.", "You need to go LC/NC with your mother. Her opinions don't matter anymore.\n\nGet her name off your bank account. Find out how she knew about your appointment and plug that hole. If necessary get your own insurance. Do not tell her anything of importance, just nod your head at her 'words of wisdom'.\n\nI'm sorry about your almost pregnancy. Get a check up to make sure everything is all right and start trying again on your own time table. When you do get pregnant, start early with boundaries. Your mother will try to tell you how to be a mother- tell her that you will make your own choices. She doesn't have to like them but she will respect them and keep her mouth shut or she'll won't be around your child.", "NTA. Your mom is a monster. Cut her off and enjoy your life with the family you built that actually loves you and treats you with respect and kindness.", "I think your mother doesn't want you to have a baby because she can't stand the idea of you growing up. She still treats you as a child; she wants to control you. If you do have a kid in the future, she will boss you around. Don't let her anymore. You have every right to cut her off and not listen to her lectures. She can't ground you. All she can do is rant at you and guilt you. Feel free to ignore her.

Either way, that sucks. \n\nSounds like you need to get a therapist to help you and your mom if you want a healthier relationship. She doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\nNow, I will say that I have \u201cmother issues.\u201d This advice may be skewed by that perspective. Your mother is helicopter parenting her female adult child but not her other male child? Something isn\u2019t right here. It may not be about gender and it may just be a control issue. I don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to see a therapist to untangle this. She can\u2019t live YOUR life for you. You aren\u2019t her \u201cdo over.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your miscarriage. I\u2019ve had one before and it was rough at the time. I\u2019ve also had an abortion. The hormones and the drop off from them are VERY REAL. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it in my life.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising your mother wasn\u2019t more empathetic. I really think you need a mediator or therapist to help work out this flaw in your relationship. As an \u201cauthority figure\u201d in your life, I doubt she will be willing to work with you to improve this aspect. Some people need a third party to \u201chear\u201d you. I hope it get better.", "Why do you put up with this woman's nonsense? \n\nWhy does she know what your finances are? Why does she know about your doctor's appointments? Put her on a severe information diet. She does not need to know any of these things. You are adults.\n\nNTA \n\n\n.", "NTA. Your mom is awful.", "NTA. Time to go NC with your horrible mother.", "\" I hope you aren\u2019t pregnant \u201c. I immediately burst into tears and said \u201ci was but now im not\u201d.

I hope you give yourself space and time to grieve and heal\n\nYou didn't make a scene, you didn't make it about yourself.  You realized you were experiencing some significant emotions and you removed yourself and went somewhere to process them.  So NTA, but your mom is.", "NTA. Your mom thos is a real B. I would go NC with her for a few months, then decide if the relationship was worth it. I tell you, if I were in your shoes, after hearing her say \n\n\"good. It breaks my heart to think of you having a baby right now. You are too immature and not financially stable enough.\"\n\nShe would be out of my life for a minimum of 2 years. When I did have a kid I wouldn't tell her, just let her find out from someone else or on the socials, and wouldn't let her be at the birth or even see the kid till he was 2 years old. I still cant understand why you would let this evil person stay in your life. She's gross.", "Also, as someone who has worked in the medical field, make sure mom is not listed as a person to be contacted on your medical records.  Example:  I have my mother for my medical records to be released to and she also has my power of attorney since she's my closest relative-I am also her's with her power of attorney also.  You would need to contact all doctors/hospitals and make sure that all contacts are changed to just your husband.  By law, information can only be released to whoever you have listed in your paperwork. If your mother's name is on the records, she can get the information easily without you even being notified, just like her name was on the banking information since  you were 17.", "NTA.

Why haven't you gone NC with your evil toxic mother?", "OP's mom and my eggdonor might be best friends..... cut her off OP", "Not always. It was mostly my dad but he stays out of stuff like this. I think it probably has something to do with the fact that her last child moved out so now shes alone with my dad and cant control anyone else", "Wtf?! She didn't go into sulk mode! She congratulated them, removed herself from the situation to feel low in private and came back. That's the adult thing to do! She can't help her feelings and so she dealt with it respectfully!", "It\u2019s definitely a generational thing but mainly in a \u201cdont bother people your problems, no one cares.\u201d Way. My grandparents are amazing. But my whole family is SUPER religious. And im not. So they have always favored my brother over me.

There may well be a time when you decide she is not someone you want to associate with or expose your children to her.\n\nMaybe you should \u201capologize\u201d to your brother and SIL. I assume they would be surprised to know what they hadn\u2019t noticed happening. Be sure to share with them exactly what your mother said. Certainly if it was ok to say, she won\u2019t mind everyone in the family knowing what sort of a nasty bully she really is.

It does not get better with age. Even in my 40s, she still criticizes me and my decisions and offers unwanted advice. The best thing I ever did was build distance into the relationship and start calling her out on her inappropriate behavior. I don\u2019t share things with her if I don\u2019t want her to know about them and I cut her off if she starts criticizing my decisions by saying something like \u201cthat\u2019s my decision.

The issue is that the OP ISN'T genuinely happy for someone else, thus the title of the post.", "She can be happy for them and not overjoyed.

You don't have to jump up and down and chat incessantly to be happy for someone especially when you are trying to swallow your grief down", "I agree but any leniency given by the brother/SIL is not the issue at hand.  The OP most certainly could have felt grief while still feeling genuinely happy for them and there'd be no questions asked.  The issue is that the OP doesn't feel genuine happiness for them, and I think that's a flaw driven by envy."]}
