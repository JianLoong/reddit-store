{"id": 3189, "submission_id": "z455uw", "title": "AITA for joining my friends on a trip but staying in a separate (better) hotel .. and doing my own thing a bit?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nMy 2 friends (they are sisters) are going on a trip for one of the girls' birthday.\n\nThey had booked and decided everything already.It's a place I have visited twice already and they know that.\n\nI decided last minute to join the trip because I have been feeling down, and wanting a change of environment. Plus it will be nice to celebrate that friend's birthday with her.\n\nThe asshole part is this.\n\nToday I told them I can join them, telling them NO PRESSURE, but I am available and can come out too...  they were both so happy and wanting me to join.\n\nI asked for the flight details and hotel.\n\nI saw immediately some things I don't like..\n\nFor example, their flight involves a connection and I know they did that because it is cheaper. I hate connecting flights. I like nonstop, and would easily pay more for that especially for international travel.\n\nSo I will be booking my own separate flight for the same dates.\n\nThe other thing is.. the hotel. Their hotel is not up to my personal standards.\n\nThey wanted me share a room, like 2 queen beds and the sisters would share and I'd have my own bed. But  I personally like having my own space. I've shared with these girls before no issue, but one of my reasons for joining this trip is to give myself a vacation too.\n\nI also don't like the area they picked to stay in. I know these friends would find it more 'fun' if we all stay at the same hotel and the same room too.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if I picked my own hotel even if it's in a different area, and a nicer hotel? and would I be the asshole for doing some things independently but also joining them on most of the other days? Some of the stuff they are doing I've done before because I've been to this place twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm afraid of being a 'mean' person or for making them feel bad by staying in a nicer hotel.. not staying with them etc.\n\nI know it's somewhat annoying as well, like at night when we have to split up.\n\nI guess my reason for doing this was to get to experience a bit if solo travel, but also have the training wheels of friends there, and then to celebrate my friend's birthday and spend time with her and her sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me it seems reasonable, but talking to my siblings, one agrees with me and the other thinks it is mean.\n\nLet me know guys.\n\nWe are all women in our 20s in this scenario\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**\n\n**I just want to clarify some things because English is NOT my first language so my thoughts are not clear and I'm sorry**\n\n*I'm not hijacking their trip. I am not intruding on it. I'm not demeaning it. Or wanting to tell them it is not good enough for me. I love my friends and would never want them to feel bad. And it's not my intention to change their trip in any way. Or tell them their hotel is not to my standard. I am just saying to them.. hey ... I can actually make it to your birthday during those days! (It took a lot of effort for me to make this happen with my schedule)  so I just shared with them that I can be there to celebrate with them. I will do everything with them as they have already planned it, and if they ask me for suggestions I will happily provide. I can go with the flow, I always do and have with these girls. I am not some 'Kardashian' that will nitpick things. I keep my mouth shut and don't say anything bad about anyone or anything. I'm not like that. I'm a considerate person but when it comes to hotels I have some level of comfortability and expectations and I have reasons for it. I was thinking if I just arrange my own for that we could still have a fun trip-- and because they already had their trip planned as a duo, I didn't think they would take offence if I joined in my own way.. dealing with the flight and accommodation and stuff on my own. So hope that clears up my perspective. I'm not trying to ruin their trip and wouldn't dream of it. My being there is supposed to be an asset not hinderance or cause issues.  I understand what people are saying. I agree with many of you. But there are some people assuming a lot negatively about me, so I felt the need to clarify it. I can be the Asshole and I accept if I am. But there's some things being assumed.. I'm not like that.*", "created_utc": 1669354622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z455uw/aita_for_joining_my_friends_on_a_trip_but_staying/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s going to make them feel bad whether that\u2019s your intention or not. And it\u2019s for an AH reason: selfishness. You want them to be your \u201ctraining\u201d wheels to satisfy your goals - and to get what you want you\u2019ll be making other people, people you call friends, feel badly, make plans more complicated, and generally add unnecessary time, adjustments, and stress / tension- all so you can have your cake and eat it too. If you do this you won\u2019t be behaving like a good friend - or any kind of friend, or even a good person - at all. The flight is whatever: knock your socks off and take a direct flight. And if they\u2019re going to specific tourist sites that you\u2019ve already been to, maybe go to at least one. But either stay with them or don\u2019t go. It\u2019s NOT about you.

It\u2019s also okay if you want to do a solo trip to wherever this is, and meet up with your friends for a night to celebrate their birthday. \n\nBut instead of doing that, it sounds like you invited yourself on their trip, they graciously welcomed you into their plans, and now you\u2019ve decided their plans aren\u2019t up to your standards. \n\nI think it\u2019s valid to take a step back and say that you were thinking it makes sense for you to travel solo but meet up some while you\u2019re all there. You shouldn\u2019t spend money on a trip you won\u2019t enjoy. \n\nBut they may not react well, and that\u2019s also okay. Particularly if you framed joining them as wanting to celebrate your friend\u2019s birthday, then backing out like this makes it clear that spending w your friends and celebrating your friend\u2019s birthday was never really your priority\u2014 which again, is okay, but from your description it sounds like you misled them.

I\u2019m sure their standards are comfortable and perfectly acceptable. Your post sounds a bit ridiculous, you may want to check your privilege. When I travel solo I stay where I want and do the fancy stuff, I don\u2019t need to budget, and I don\u2019t - when it\u2019s just me!

This really shouldn\u2019t be any different. You aren\u2019t asking them to alter their plans at all to accommodate you.

Since they are going together, I don\u2019t see why they need an extra person apart from cost sharing. If you can afford it, bring for an extra thingie for the bday celebration, a bottle of wine or some nice appetisers or something?", "NAH because you're just tagging along. You weren't involved in the initial planning. There may not even be seats on that flight or accommodation available where they're staying anyway. You can just hang out to do specific activities. They may enjoy some alone time too.", "You have to just talk to them.

I want to try a little solo travel, but I also want to hang out with you two! No worries if you feel like it would be weird for me to be there, but kind of separately though.\" I would be careful how you frame anything you say about the hotel, because I could see how that might come off badly.\n\nIt just depends on what they're like. I can't imagine any of my friends pressuring me if I said I'd rather have my own sleeping space or that I wanted to fly direct because it's less stressful. We're all people with different needs and priorities. Some of us have anxiety about traveling, some of us have less money, some of us need more rest than others and would struggle to share a room with people who wanted to stay out late. You don't all have to have the same experience. But when I was in my late teens/early twenties, I feel like there was more pressure and less empathy around that stuff. I think there's also a cultural element, but I think you just have to talk it out.\n\nNTA", "Soooo income differences among friends is TOUGH. I honestly don't think there is any nice or good way to explain this to them. No matter how gently you put it, they will receive the message that they are not enough, they are poor and you look down on them EVEN IF THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU INTEND! Money is an extremely emotional topic for many people and it is important to be sensitive to that. \n\nIt's so hard not to compare ourselves to our friends and it can bring out A LOT of bitterness and resentment if someone has more money than others. \n\nI think you should sit this one out and do something when they get back for the friends birthday. \n\nI think if you tried to go along with your plan YWBTA, even if you don't mean to be. You're not TA for wanting to stay at nice places or for having money. You seem like a genuinely nice person who's in a tough social spot. \n\nAlso I notice the idea that you can't travel with these girls is bothering you. Unfortunately that may be the case unless you are willing to foot the bill for them to stay with you in nice hotels. If that's something you don't want to do there is no shame in that. However you probably won't be able to travel with these girls. This does not make you less of friends. This does not invalidate your relationship. It means you're not compatible with traveling together and that is 100% okay. There is no reason to feel bad about that.\n\nDon't try to force something that's not meant to be.

Would definitely be strange if they took issue with it.", "NTA nothing wrong with giving them time together without you or you staying in your own room.. perhaps as a birthday gift, upgrade their hotel to be the same as yours?  \n\nI'd be honest with them and just see if they have issue before even going. This gives everyone the chance to say it won't work instead of getting there and then fighting. \n\nOther option is just don't go. Use your vacation time to go somewhere new later on.", "Personally, I would *prefer* what you're suggesting if I was the other party. Some space and having solo time is literally a must-have for me on any trip--even visiting family or traveling with my husband, I always need at least a day or two that I'm just ALONE and can do whatever I want and not talk to anyone.

It didn't matter who initiated the planning, we were happy to have qaulity time with friends we cared about.", "YWNBTA if you communicate this well. If you say that you will plan your own solo vacation and just meet up for a couple days there just to celebrate the birthday, then it should be fine.

As people grow and improve in their careers and lives, their standards AND budgets change. You may be incompatible in this way NOW, but that may very easily change in the years to come. Also, peoples' standards tend to change ANYWAY as they get older so they just budget differently for trips based on their priority. \n\nMy suggestion? Don't go on this trip. Next time, plan a trip but lay down your own boundaries regarding the hotel - you guys can budget activities according to that.

Why join a birthday trip if you don\u2019t want to spend time with someone like people usually would on said persons birthday trip? You have to admit it is a little odd.

You mentioned you have already visited this city before - it makes sense you wouldn't want to repeat certain activities but from what you described, it sounds like you are looking for a solo vacation with occasional meet-ups with friends. \n\nIf my friend asked to join a trip I had scheduled already with another person and then shared your plan, I would feel at the very least disappointed and at worst demeaned. It's okay that you have a different budget from your friend but it's very possible that she will feel bad that you can't actually join the trip as she expected because the plans/accommodations that she is looking forward to don't meet your expectations. You are implicitly making a statement that you have higher standards and what she can afford isn't good enough, even if you don't intend on giving off that impression (which it sounds like you don't as this is a good friend of yours).\n\nI would advise you to just pull out of the trip, find another city to travel to (one you haven't been to before), and celebrate your friend's birthday in some other way with her. Or you could also explain to your friend why the area you want to stay in is a better area (you have some experience you could impart from your previous trips there) and see if you can find an affordable option for all three of you in that area.\n\nI have traveled a lot with friends and individually and can share:\n\n(1) It's more difficult than you would expect to meet up with friends when you're staying in an entirely different part of the city, even if it's a small city.\n\n(2) The best way to achieve the group travel independence you're looking for is by staying in the same hotel as a friend and splitting up for activities during the day, meeting up in between for lunch or dinner and then going out together, if you both are interested in that. It's nice to have the same hotel as a common home base to share taxis/Ubers, get ready together, start off the day together, even if you have different interests and itineraries during parts of the day.\n\n(3) Travel compatibility is important. I was recently reminded of this when I had a very unfortunate big fight with one of my best friends while traveling together. I have fought with this friend only a handful of times over a 10-year+ friendship, and our biggest fights all happened on trips. I absolutely love her but have to admit to myself that at this point traveling together is damaging our friendship and is unhealthy. Ironically, what makes our friendship so tight at \"home\" causes us to increase each other's stress levels while away. This is a genuine disappointment because we otherwise share a passion for global travel, have really similar interests and preferences on activities, and our budgets align. But the long-term friendship takes precedence for me. \n\nI just think it's important to consider whether the fun of celebrating your friend's birthday abroad with her is worth possibly isolating her or getting into a disagreement that affects your friendship after you return. For example, say you want to go to a fancier place for dinner than she does but she can't afford it -- now she feels bad leaving you alone for dinner while she's with her sister and decides to join you anyway - but she feels uncomfortable about the cost and doesn't share that with you. These types of differences in preference arise all the time on vacation and if your friend doesn't communicate upfront with you, or vice versa, it can cause frustration or resentment that may hurt your friendship even after returning. Tread carefully and communicate openly if you end up joining your friend's vacation.", "Imagine \u201csetting boundaries\u201d about somebody else\u2019s birthday trip that you are *inviting yourself to join*", "I wish they could see it like that. \n\nI absolutely don't want to one-up them at all. For context. This trip is to NYC. The hotel they chose is a 2 star hotel in Queens. I've been to NYC twice before, I would not recommend a hotel in that area, and on top of that especially when they are going to be going into Manhattan for everything on their agenda. But still -- that is their choice and I am sure they have reasons,  I would never ever imply or even say anything bad about their hotel or the way they planned their trip. I am extremely considerate and have gone on past trips with them and done it all their way... But I also know myself and I struggled a lot in those accommodations and didn't enjoy the trip as much as they did. So I realize forever in this friendship we are not going to be compatible on those little things, even though we love each others company. I was trying to find a way to be there for my friend but also be as you said.. comfortable. I can't stay in a place like they have chosen. And I have the means to stay in a place I am comfortable with.  I've always been picky and paranoid about hotels and stuff.

Want to meet up for food while we're there?\"\n\nThis would be totally fine. It's all about the phrasing here. If someone told you they wanted to join your trip but wouldn't stay at the hotel you picked or join you for the flight wouldn't you feel a bit weird about that?"]}
