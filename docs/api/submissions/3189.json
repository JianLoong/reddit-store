{"id": 3189, "submission_id": "z455uw", "title": "AITA for joining my friends on a trip but staying in a separate (better) hotel .. and doing my own thing a bit?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nMy 2 friends (they are sisters) are going on a trip for one of the girls' birthday.\n\nThey had booked and decided everything already.It's a place I have visited twice already and they know that.\n\nI decided last minute to join the trip because I have been feeling down, and wanting a change of environment. Plus it will be nice to celebrate that friend's birthday with her.\n\nThe asshole part is this.\n\nToday I told them I can join them, telling them NO PRESSURE, but I am available and can come out too...  they were both so happy and wanting me to join.\n\nI asked for the flight details and hotel.\n\nI saw immediately some things I don't like..\n\nFor example, their flight involves a connection and I know they did that because it is cheaper. I hate connecting flights. I like nonstop, and would easily pay more for that especially for international travel.\n\nSo I will be booking my own separate flight for the same dates.\n\nThe other thing is.. the hotel. Their hotel is not up to my personal standards.\n\nThey wanted me share a room, like 2 queen beds and the sisters would share and I'd have my own bed. But  I personally like having my own space. I've shared with these girls before no issue, but one of my reasons for joining this trip is to give myself a vacation too.\n\nI also don't like the area they picked to stay in. I know these friends would find it more 'fun' if we all stay at the same hotel and the same room too.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if I picked my own hotel even if it's in a different area, and a nicer hotel? and would I be the asshole for doing some things independently but also joining them on most of the other days? Some of the stuff they are doing I've done before because I've been to this place twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm afraid of being a 'mean' person or for making them feel bad by staying in a nicer hotel.. not staying with them etc.\n\nI know it's somewhat annoying as well, like at night when we have to split up.\n\nI guess my reason for doing this was to get to experience a bit if solo travel, but also have the training wheels of friends there, and then to celebrate my friend's birthday and spend time with her and her sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me it seems reasonable, but talking to my siblings, one agrees with me and the other thinks it is mean.\n\nLet me know guys.\n\nWe are all women in our 20s in this scenario\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**\n\n**I just want to clarify some things because English is NOT my first language so my thoughts are not clear and I'm sorry**\n\n*I'm not hijacking their trip. I am not intruding on it. I'm not demeaning it. Or wanting to tell them it is not good enough for me. I love my friends and would never want them to feel bad. And it's not my intention to change their trip in any way. Or tell them their hotel is not to my standard. I am just saying to them.. hey ... I can actually make it to your birthday during those days! (It took a lot of effort for me to make this happen with my schedule)  so I just shared with them that I can be there to celebrate with them. I will do everything with them as they have already planned it, and if they ask me for suggestions I will happily provide. I can go with the flow, I always do and have with these girls. I am not some 'Kardashian' that will nitpick things. I keep my mouth shut and don't say anything bad about anyone or anything. I'm not like that. I'm a considerate person but when it comes to hotels I have some level of comfortability and expectations and I have reasons for it. I was thinking if I just arrange my own for that we could still have a fun trip-- and because they already had their trip planned as a duo, I didn't think they would take offence if I joined in my own way.. dealing with the flight and accommodation and stuff on my own. So hope that clears up my perspective. I'm not trying to ruin their trip and wouldn't dream of it. My being there is supposed to be an asset not hinderance or cause issues.  I understand what people are saying. I agree with many of you. But there are some people assuming a lot negatively about me, so I felt the need to clarify it. I can be the Asshole and I accept if I am. But there's some things being assumed.. I'm not like that.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*  Final EDIT: \n\n*I think I need to change my wording about the whole 'Join' thing. People are misunderstanding. I just told my friend I can be there for her birthday (previously I couldn't due to schedule conflicts) They have a trip planned already and I'm in no way wanting to disrupt that so I told them if they want me to tag along, I can make it there and hang out\\~ but if its weird because I'm kind of separate ... then no pressure, just go on without me. I would be with them every day, just not here or there like a half day or few hours because it's things I've done already*\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1669354622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z455uw/aita_for_joining_my_friends_on_a_trip_but_staying/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You want them to be your \u201ctraining\u201d wheels to satisfy your goals - and to get what you want you\u2019ll be making other people, people you call friends, feel badly, make plans more complicated, and generally add unnecessary time, adjustments, and stress / tension- all so you can have your cake and eat it too. If you do this you won\u2019t be behaving like a good friend - or any kind of friend, or even a good person - at all. The flight is whatever: knock your socks off and take a direct flight.

It\u2019s also okay if you want to do a solo trip to wherever this is, and meet up with your friends for a night to celebrate their birthday. \n\nBut instead of doing that, it sounds like you invited yourself on their trip, they graciously welcomed you into their plans, and now you\u2019ve decided their plans aren\u2019t up to your standards. \n\nI think it\u2019s valid to take a step back and say that you were thinking it makes sense for you to travel solo but meet up some while you\u2019re all there. You shouldn\u2019t spend money on a trip you won\u2019t enjoy. \n\nBut they may not react well, and that\u2019s also okay. Particularly if you framed joining them as wanting to celebrate your friend\u2019s birthday, then backing out like this makes it clear that spending w your friends and celebrating your friend\u2019s birthday was never really your priority\u2014 which again, is okay, but from your description it sounds like you misled them.

I\u2019m sure their standards are comfortable and perfectly acceptable. Your post sounds a bit ridiculous, you may want to check your privilege.

This really shouldn\u2019t be any different. You aren\u2019t asking them to alter their plans at all to accommodate you. You\u2019re essentially just having two independent trips at the same time and meeting up a lot.

Since they are going together, I don\u2019t see why they need an extra person apart from cost sharing. If you can afford it, bring for an extra thingie for the bday celebration, a bottle of wine or some nice appetisers or something?", "NAH because you're just tagging along. You weren't involved in the initial planning. There may not even be seats on that flight or accommodation available where they're staying anyway. You can just hang out to do specific activities. They may enjoy some alone time too.", "You have to just talk to them. Something like \"Hey, is it cool if I do my own thing a bit, maybe pick my own hotel, and we can meet up and do stuff while we're both there? I want to try a little solo travel, but I also want to hang out with you two! No worries if you feel like it would be weird for me to be there, but kind of separately though.\" I would be careful how you frame anything you say about the hotel, because I could see how that might come off badly.\n\nIt just depends on what they're like. I can't imagine any of my friends pressuring me if I said I'd rather have my own sleeping space or that I wanted to fly direct because it's less stressful. We're all people with different needs and priorities. Some of us have anxiety about traveling, some of us have less money, some of us need more rest than others and would struggle to share a room with people who wanted to stay out late. You don't all have to have the same experience. But when I was in my late teens/early twenties, I feel like there was more pressure and less empathy around that stuff. I think there's also a cultural element, but I think you just have to talk it out.\n\nNTA", "Soooo income differences among friends is TOUGH. I honestly don't think there is any nice or good way to explain this to them. No matter how gently you put it, they will receive the message that they are not enough, they are poor and you look down on them EVEN IF THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU INTEND! Money is an extremely emotional topic for many people and it is important to be sensitive to that. \n\nIt's so hard not to compare ourselves to our friends and it can bring out A LOT of bitterness and resentment if someone has more money than others. \n\nI think you should sit this one out and do something when they get back for the friends birthday. \n\nI think if you tried to go along with your plan YWBTA, even if you don't mean to be. You're not TA for wanting to stay at nice places or for having money. You seem like a genuinely nice person who's in a tough social spot. \n\nAlso I notice the idea that you can't travel with these girls is bothering you. Unfortunately that may be the case unless you are willing to foot the bill for them to stay with you in nice hotels. If that's something you don't want to do there is no shame in that. However you probably won't be able to travel with these girls. This does not make you less of friends. This does not invalidate your relationship. It means you're not compatible with traveling together and that is 100% okay. There is no reason to feel bad about that.\n\nDon't try to force something that's not meant to be. Focus on building memories where you can all be comfortable. \ud83d\ude0a", "Totally NTA. I don't see why any of this would be a big deal. Would definitely be strange if they took issue with it.", "NTA nothing wrong with giving them time together without you or you staying in your own room.. perhaps as a birthday gift, upgrade their hotel to be the same as yours?  \n\nI'd be honest with them and just see if they have issue before even going. This gives everyone the chance to say it won't work instead of getting there and then fighting. \n\nOther option is just don't go. Use your vacation time to go somewhere new later on.", "Personally, I would *prefer* what you're suggesting if I was the other party. Some space and having solo time is literally a must-have for me on any trip--even visiting family or traveling with my husband, I always need at least a day or two that I'm just ALONE and can do whatever I want and not talk to anyone. I love going out to eat, going to a movie, a museum, etc. *by myself* after spending time with others. I need it.

I don't agree with those that are saying you have to settle for lower accommodations and flights to be able to spend time with the birthday girl and sister.

It\u2019s just how it is", "Duh", "NTA - I wouldn't say you're necessarily an asshole here - I just think that you're not travel-compatible with your friend, at least at this point in your lives.\n\nThe most core parts of traveling with a friend include consensus over (1) a budget, especially with regard to flights and quality of hotels, (2) common interests in types of activities, e.g. hiking vs. city and a broader itinerary, (3) speed of travel, \"vacation mode\" vs. \"tourist mode,\" and start/end time each day. You mentioned you have already visited this city before - it makes sense you wouldn't want to repeat certain activities but from what you described, it sounds like you are looking for a solo vacation with occasional meet-ups with friends. \n\nIf my friend asked to join a trip I had scheduled already with another person and then shared your plan, I would feel at the very least disappointed and at worst demeaned. It's okay that you have a different budget from your friend but it's very possible that she will feel bad that you can't actually join the trip as she expected because the plans/accommodations that she is looking forward to don't meet your expectations. You are implicitly making a statement that you have higher standards and what she can afford isn't good enough, even if you don't intend on giving off that impression (which it sounds like you don't as this is a good friend of yours).\n\nI would advise you to just pull out of the trip, find another city to travel to (one you haven't been to before), and celebrate your friend's birthday in some other way with her. Or you could also explain to your friend why the area you want to stay in is a better area (you have some experience you could impart from your previous trips there) and see if you can find an affordable option for all three of you in that area.\n\nI have traveled a lot with friends and individually and can share:\n\n(1) It's more difficult than you would expect to meet up with friends when you're staying in an entirely different part of the city, even if it's a small city.\n\n(2) The best way to achieve the group travel independence you're looking for is by staying in the same hotel as a friend and splitting up for activities during the day, meeting up in between for lunch or dinner and then going out together, if you both are interested in that. It's nice to have the same hotel as a common home base to share taxis/Ubers, get ready together, start off the day together, even if you have different interests and itineraries during parts of the day.\n\n(3) Travel compatibility is important. I was recently reminded of this when I had a very unfortunate big fight with one of my best friends while traveling together. I have fought with this friend only a handful of times over a 10-year+ friendship, and our biggest fights all happened on trips. I absolutely love her but have to admit to myself that at this point traveling together is damaging our friendship and is unhealthy. Ironically, what makes our friendship so tight at \"home\" causes us to increase each other's stress levels while away. This is a genuine disappointment because we otherwise share a passion for global travel, have really similar interests and preferences on activities, and our budgets align. But the long-term friendship takes precedence for me. \n\nI just think it's important to consider whether the fun of celebrating your friend's birthday abroad with her is worth possibly isolating her or getting into a disagreement that affects your friendship after you return. For example, say you want to go to a fancier place for dinner than she does but she can't afford it -- now she feels bad leaving you alone for dinner while she's with her sister and decides to join you anyway - but she feels uncomfortable about the cost and doesn't share that with you. These types of differences in preference arise all the time on vacation and if your friend doesn't communicate upfront with you, or vice versa, it can cause frustration or resentment that may hurt your friendship even after returning. Tread carefully and communicate openly if you end up joining your friend's vacation.", "Imagine \u201csetting boundaries\u201d about somebody else\u2019s birthday trip that you are *inviting yourself to join*", "I wish they could see it like that. \n\nI absolutely don't want to one-up them at all. For context. This trip is to NYC. The hotel they chose is a 2 star hotel in Queens. I've been to NYC twice before, I would not recommend a hotel in that area, and on top of that especially when they are going to be going into Manhattan for everything on their agenda. But still -- that is their choice and I am sure they have reasons,  I would never ever imply or even say anything bad about their hotel or the way they planned their trip. I am extremely considerate and have gone on past trips with them and done it all their way... But I also know myself and I struggled a lot in those accommodations and didn't enjoy the trip as much as they did. So I realize forever in this friendship we are not going to be compatible on those little things, even though we love each others company. I was trying to find a way to be there for my friend but also be as you said.. comfortable. I can't stay in a place like they have chosen. And I have the means to stay in a place I am comfortable with.  I've always been picky and paranoid about hotels and stuff.

You're joining them for the parts worth your time. But doing assumedly better things the rest. \n\nYou're not staying nearby, so you spend the whole day together.

Different living accommodations, different activities, plan to have a mutual birthday dinner and then go separate ways.

Which isn't necessarily a bad thing - but again, some people might feel slightly hurt about something like that.\n\nAll in all i'd say i couldn't really recomment what to do, i know neither you nor your friends. i'd suggest flying earlier/later (thus avoiding that discussion) and then simply discuss what your expectations/wishe for the trip are, and what theirs are.\n\nAlso - things you have done and they haven't yet, may still be fun, as you can be kind of a guide and experience it in a new way.", "AH?

I get that. But I am trying my best to make it to this birthday too.. paying a lot of premium to fly last min. Just to be there for her.\n\nSharing is hard for me because I got assaulted once during a shared room situation and so thats a personal anxiety of mine.. along with just.. needing my own space. The friends party more than me, invite people to the hotel and stuff..  it would just be nice for me to have my own space to have somewhere to go you know? I enjoy their company in every other way, but having some personal space is important (this could be some kind of a cultural thing a bit too, or idk maybe I'm weird).", "Thats all I wanted .. like a nice trip but we can all have our freedom.", "I don't want that : ( so I'll probably not go ahead with it lol I think most people agree here that it would be a bad idea", "It's a bad idea. No hotel upgrade for me!", "Its 7 days..", "It was more like.. they have already planned their trip. So for some things I can't do with them, I'd just do solo things and get that experience a bit? I already have to do a different flight because I'm booking after them. And the solo stuff.. it's like a few hours here or there not even a big chunk of time. We'd be together every day! and close by, it's like.. me not paying going up into the Empire State Building but them going together for a thing like that. Small things like this only.  I was just trying to explain my thought process .. but maybe that piece of info was unnecessary.", "You're totally right and I do see everyones point in some way! they are right (just some people go way beyond that and start insulting me, or calling me names and assuming what kind of person I am, like there's a girl in my DMs attacking me I had to block her)...\n\nThe togetherness is so true\n\nI don't want to ruin that and I think they have that expectation.. even if I'm joining late. And that includes hotel.\n\nThanks for respectfully sharing your insight!", "I totally agree with you and youre  right.\n\nI think I was focused on trying to make this trip work for everyone including me, given my emotions and circumstances .. like trying to be comfortable  at the same time but it made me blind to some important things that might make my friends feel bad.\n\nI was always going to be upfront with them though, even about the solo stuff. My way of saying it was so bad, but I just meant I don't mind not doing everything together for a few hours in a day here or there, because I can just see it as a safe 'solo' experience, like training wheels in that sense. Not using my friends without their knowledge or something like that.", "My phrasing sucks so bad.\n\nContext matters so much. These solo activities its like.. few hours here and there. Real life example: me not going up into the Empire State Building, and instead roaming around a bit while they do it. It doesn't take long. Just one or two small things like this, otherwise I'd be there for it ALL. Every day. Morning to night. And all the things they want to do are where I would get a hotel near. They for some reason chose a hotel in a totally different area and are choosing to commute into the area I rather just get a hotel more central. I respect that. It's their trip. I was just trying to kind of make myself accommodated too, I didn't think that it would ruin their trip as in my head they had already planned it all as a duo. I was just going to be a welcome surprise? like another friend that can make it out to celebrate the birthday. I really didn't think it would be offensive but I can see how me being there but kind of separate might make my friends feel bad. Because maybe they want more togetherness. It doesn't bother me but they are different. I have to consider that. And I will.\n\nThe hotel upgrade is going to come across shitty move no matter what I think. If I could upgrade them I would but its too last minute and too expensive \\*7day trip.  I think people are right about what they say in a lot of ways.", "You're totally right\\~ I don't want to do that to them.", "Different types of travellers answering this post I guess. I would never take offence for my friends doing their own thing a little bit here and there. And this solo stuff I'm talking about is like a few hours here and there.. we are together otherwise every day.. The hotel part ruins it though. I agree with people for saying it's an asshole move. Because maybe they will compare my hotel and theirs.", "Right. It's not. It's more like .. me being able to be there and join them for some of their vacation. They are still doing everything they want and planned. So just to clarify.. I was just being honest that I can use it as practice for being more independent.. like for the small parts of the trip where they do some things I can't be part of because its pre-planned by them already (things involving tickets for eg) or one or two small things I've done already (like going up inside to see the Empire State Building)... it was not some secret intention. I would be very upfront about it all. It was more like me sharing some of my thinking process but maybe that was unnecessary to write about", "I was invited. I couldn't come. Then I moved some things around with work so I let them know hey.. I'm able to come.. it's last minute so no pressure if you have your trip planned.  I won't be intruding on it. I can figure out flights and lodgings on my own since they have booked everything for themselves already. Just letting you know I can be there for your birthday and do things with you guys too.  Thats all I've said to them so far. My friends know I've been there before twice so they didn't really press me to go with them, they would also understand I think if I didn't want to repeat some things twice (and I'm talking like small stuff like a 2 hour thing here or there -- being nearby exploring while they do the thing). Me being there is something my friend wants.. it's not me just adding myself to their trip uninvited. I'm not trying to change their trip any way either. I just wanted a different hotel and asked here if that was too rude to do esp if there's a difference in the look of the hotel. Not drastic but noticeable. I feel that people are right and this is an asshole move.\n\nIt's not about poor or whatever. Some people don't care about the accommodation part of travel but I do. So we are just used to a different type of accommodation. I was just trying to get something I'm comfortable with since I'm separate anyway? but like I said.. I don't think in this situation it's a good idea.. and agree with the things people present (For the most part). So I'm not going to do that.", "I'm a nurse. And I haven't been anywhere since Covid. I love my friends so much too, and I had to swap so many shifts to make this happen last minute.. I missed so many life events due to being stuck at work because we are short staff. So this was my best attempt but I felt being cramped on top of each other was going to personally be hard for me, so I wanted to treat myself a little to at least some privacy and a hotel I'm comfortable with but I think my friends will take it the wrong way and thats understandable so ... not happening .. I was always going to frame it like this is a separate thing but  at the same time I'll be available to spend as much time as I can with them. But people here didn't understand me. Thats probably my fault", "I think you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole if this was just a fun trip with friends, so about all of you equally. But it\u2019s one of their birthdays, so this is NOT about you and if you are going to go, you need to prioritise your friend and suffer the discomfort. \n\nI don\u2019t think there are any assholes here really, but think about how the birthday girl would feel with you staying in a fancy hotel that she can\u2019t afford, on HER special day.", "I think they may have been excited to share a room so that their costs would be reduced when you pay your share, so it is worth considering that this was a bonus for them initially, they were maybe even hoping you would pay half for the hotel as you would have one bed to yourself\u2026. I would say NTA for wanting to have your own room on holiday, but this isn\u2019t going to make them happy I don\u2019t think.", "So tell them that. \nThat you'll be in NYC in around that time and you would like to join to for (some of) the celebration. \nDon't \"join\" their trip.", "If they\u2019re staying in Queens and you\u2019re staying in Manhattan, then arranging your meetups every day would be an inconvenience all by itself.", "Why don\u2019t you offer to upgrade her hotel as a birthday gift so you can join last minute? Tell her you\u2019d love for her to stay in Manhattan. Make it about her and get a suite or something.", "So, what happens when you're not comfortable with their \"slumming it\" choice of activities or restaurants. Are you going to ditch them to do more premium activities and dining?\n\nThis isn't about the bday girl at all. It sounds like you plan to do a Solo Trip but meet up with them if/when you get nervous traveling by yourself or lonely...", "NP and good luck. For what it's worth, I do understand what you're saying. Everyone just needs to be on the same page if you want to have different accommodations. Being late, deviating from plans, having to find each other, not being able to contact each other, being clear that no one is \"ditching\" anyone when you aren't together are just some things that all of you will need to be ok with.  \n\n  \nTo be clear, we were fine with former friend staying at a separate hotel. It was everything else that she and some of the others had issues with.", "I do t think you should go. Plan out a nice time for yourself elsewhere and not on the same dates as them lol", "I totally get that hence my vote for NTA, but I really think how you approach the issue of explaining it to your friends is crucial.\n\nJust don't make them feel like they are below your standards  nor that they are too much of party animals nor that you feel you may get assaulted by staying with them.\n\nTurn it around into making it the issue about you not them :\n\nI need more rest and space\n\nI like to take naps more often\n\nI know if I stayed with you it would cause you some discomfort due to my need of xyz\n\nI don't do well with long flights\n\nAirports give me anxiety\n\nI don't want to be ruining your fun\n\nEtc.\n\nFlights and stop overs are exhausting, I try to get everywhere I can directly too.

Even still. If you cant deal with the plans they have made, don't go. I can see getting your own room in the same hotel, even the flight, but thats it. Id be offended as a friend. I did see your comments so i know you're considering things. Good ouck!", "Unfortunately you were coming off as snobby.", "I think so and I think it ruins the togetherness of it which maybe is an expectation for them .. I don't want that!

I thought being a late and separate addition would excuse me a bit for choosing differently.
