Specially shaped for a good fit. Cons: Slicker surface makes you more likely to slip.\n\nTextured pre-shaped transparent. Pros: Less prone to slippage than the slick version. Cons: May be somewhat thicker and slightly more noticeable. On patterned soles like mine they will distort the pattern. \n\nRed pre-shaped. Pros: Specially made for these shoes So fit and colour will be ideal. Cons: Smooth surface.\n\nYou will also have a choice of ones to protect just the very bottom that connects with the floor (easier to apply, better texturing to reduce slips, does not protect the arch area) or one that goes all the way to the heel (harder to apply, more likely to be a slick texture, less Noticeable due to seamless fit.
