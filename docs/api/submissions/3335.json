Instead she wants to be petty in her attitude because she didn't get her way. \n\nIf she mentions the shoes again simply tell her you cannot afford to replace such an expensive gift if for any reason they are damaged.

A first edition book my parents had bought me and inscribed a sweet note in the cover. It was returned to me completely torn apart. Pages falling out, spine unglued and frayed and just dirty. It was as if the book got caught up in a tornado.
