They were also a gift from my mom, and the heel is very skinny and easily damaged\u2026. One misstep off a curb and the leather will get scraped off the stiletto. Not easily fixed.

Had she seen you wearing those shoes before? I have a feeling, from the way you've written this, that she knew about those shoes, and that she came over with the sole intention of borrowing them, and them only. Her reaction to being told no is very telling. If she was just after a pair of black shoes, she'd have kept looking. But she'd gone with only one pair of shoes in mind, so when she was told no to those, she left empty handed.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to be protective of an important gift, that was given by someone who is important to you.
