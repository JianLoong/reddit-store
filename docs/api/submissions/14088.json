{"id": 14088, "submission_id": "12cxe3b", "title": "AITA for removing my daughters from my health insurance plan?", "selftext": "Throwaway, fake names. \n\nI (57M) have two daughters, Jane (23F) and Lucy (20F). \n\nSome context: 10 years ago, while I was married to their mother Amy (55F), I began an affair with Sara (38F). I ended up moving to a different state to live with Sara, divorced Amy, and married Sara a year later. I was just very unhappy in my marriage with Amy, she is an very mentally ill woman and I couldn\u2019t continue the life I had with her. I did not fight for custody, as I felt that would further hurt Jane and Lucy. I paid child support and saw them once a year per visitation agreement until they turned 18.  \n\nOver the past few years, Sara and I have really tried to reconnect and build relationships with Jane and Lucy. I have apologized for my mistakes and do everything I can to be an involved in their lives. However, neither Jane nor Lucy are interested in a relationship with us, their reasons being that I destroyed their mother\u2019s life and they will never forgive me for missing their childhoods. I understand their pain but I can\u2019t change the past and considering it\u2019s been 10 years since the divorce and the girls are adults, I am of the opinion that they need to make an effort to see my perspective and work towards forgiveness. \n\nThe current situation at hand is where I may be TA. Jane and Lucy are both under my health insurance, as their mother doesn\u2019t work. I have really good insurance through my job and we are in the US, so Jane and Lucy are technically eligible for coverage under my plan until they are 26. However, when it was time for me to re-enroll for the upcoming year, I decided to remove the girls from my plan. I find it a bit ridiculous that even though Jane and Lucy are unwilling to even attempt to have any kind of relationship with me, they have no problem benefiting from my health insurance policy that I work extremely hard for. Sara and I notified the girls of the decision over an email, and even offered to help them find new policies of their own. I know that Jane has a good job that would most likely offer an insurance package, and Lucy is in college so she could probably enroll under the university\u2019s insurance. Or, the girls could convince their mom to finally get a job so she can cover them. Jane responded to the email, saying my decision is cruel and that I have now destroyed any chance of having a relationship with either of them.\n\nIt\u2019s been several months since I removed the girls as beneficiaries and I sometimes question my decision. The girls have blocked me from their social media accounts, which has been hard for me, as it was the only way for me to be involved in their lives. I still think I made the right choice by standing my ground, but also wonder whether or not AITA?  \n\ntldr; AITA for removing my (57M) daughters (Jane 23F and Lucy 20F) from my health insurance plan after several years of low contact from them?", "created_utc": 1680727765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cxe3b/aita_for_removing_my_daughters_from_my_health/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A massive one at that.  You wrote, \u201c I was just very unhappy in my marriage with Amy, she is an very mentally ill woman\u2026.\u201d\n\nSo, you cheated on your wife and then left your two young daughter with a woman who is so mentally ill that you, an adult, couldn\u2019t handle it.  Do you hate your children, are you that much of a selfish coward, or lying about the circumstances of your affair?  Because it has to be one of the three.\n\nThe absolute least you could do to is let them stay on your healthcarr.", "Info what\u2019s the problem? You got exactly what you wanted", "YTA. There are so many of the same story on here: I had a midlife crisis, left my wife for a younger woman, and basically abandoned my kids.

You are the definition of AH.", "So you cheated on your wife, divorced her and married your way younger wife and moved to another state, away from the family you created with your ex, going LC with your daughters.\n\n *I did not fight for custody, as I felt that would further hurt Jane and Lucy.*\n\nYou confirmed not wanting them by not fighting for them.\n\nNow they are adults and the parenting stage is over you want to reconnect with your daughters.\n\nAfter all you did it's obvious that rebuilding a relation, rebuilding their trust in you which you had shattered all those years ago, that it is something which is going to take time and patience.\n\nSo what do you do: kick them of your health plan...\n\nYTA", "**YTA and you are selfish.**\n\nThe health of our children is probably the number one concern for any loving parent. The fact a parent would willfully cancel health insurance (for any reason) for their child is absolutely, unequivocally disgusting. I have no words for you.\n\nAdditionally, expecting your children to just \"get over\" and \"understand your perspective\" for abandoning them is ridiculous. You have no idea of the impact you forced on your children's lives because of your selfish decision. You left them with a mentally ill mother and sacrficed their happiness for your own - what kind of parent does this? You need to grow up already.", "> I notified the girls of the decision over an email\n\nYes, the way to build a relationship is to notify someone of a fait accompli that will have an adverse impact on their lives without any prior discussion. In fairness, though, it does communicate loud and clear exactly how much you value building bridges.\n\n> I still think I made the right choice by standing my ground\n\nThere's absolutely no virtue in standing your ground if you make the wrong decision in the first place.\n\nYTA", "YTA, because this is the situation:\n\n1) You abandoned your children when they were 10 and 13 because you were \"unhappy\" being married to their mother, had an affair, divorce, and saw your kids once a year until they turned 18.\n\n2) Now when their young adults you want them to forgive you and see your \"perspective\" of it. You abandoned your children because you didn't want to stay married to their mother!\n\n3) When you failed to reach out to them and give them proper time to handle the fact that you abandoned them, then you PUNISH them by taking away their health insurance?\n\n4) How did you think this was going to work out? They would magically be happy with you when you abandoned them for a second time by ending the support with the health plan? Of course this decision would destroy any chance of mending this broken relationship. You punished them because they couldn't forgive you for abandoning them! Instead of giving them more time you just took away something good you actually did for them. Why?", "YTA. You abandoned your children. You cheated. You lied. And then you managed to find a way to abandon them again. \n\nAlso, university insurance is usually far too expensive for any college student to afford. I'd bet your daughter is going around with no insurance, not able to see a doctor when she needs to, all because of your selfishness. I'm sure they both felt so hurt and betrayed by this. \n\nI'm just so disgusted", "YTA.\n\nYou:\n\n1) Cheated on your wife; 2) Abandoned your children to someone you claim is mentally unwell; 3) Then get mad because they're still angry, and 4) Decide to cut them off from health insurance, something that can be a matter of life or death for them, not to mention the financial upheaval you just caused them in trying to suddenly find coverage before they get sick.\n\n\\#1 Father right here. Someone get this man a mug!", "Wow, what an asshole. I mean, I guess it\u2019s good you reminded them about your true character so that they didn\u2019t waste any more time on you? YTA", "YTA. You basically abandoned them and then tell them they need to get over it. If your ex was so mentally ill that you couldnt stand being with her anymore, what were you thinking leaving two children alone with her? You say you did it as to not hurt them but i think thats just something you tell yourself to feel better about dipping out of their lives and offering nothing other than basic financial support.  \nYou want the benefits of having a loving father-daughter relationship with them without doing the work. It takes a whole lot of time and effort to prove to one's children that you can be a source of positivity and support after such a deep betrayal. Instead of acknowledging that, you took away the one source of support left. You're absolutely allowed to do so. Its your money. You simply have to be willing to deal with the consequences.", "YTA. You waited until after they turned 18 so that you could circumvent the custody arrangement, and are now punishing them when they don\u2019t just accept you or your new spouse with open arms.  In MOST cases, the price increase on health insurance doesn\u2019t increase that significantly going from insurance covering you+spouse to you+spouse+dependents.  You waited until open enrollment to punish them.\n\nHow\u2019d that email go?\n\u201cHi Jane, hello Lucy.  It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ll never love me or accept Sara the way I expect you to.  You\u2019re over 18 now, so figure it out.  Love, Dad\u201d\n\nYou fucked around and you\u2019re finding out, and  you want people you don\u2019t know to tell you you did the right thing.  What if they were in the middle of treatment and were no longer able to afford the now out-of-pocket costs? What if they were afflicted with mental health issues similar to what you purported their mother had, and lost access to covered providers & medication.", "YTA. \n\nYou left your two children with a mentally ill, unemployed woman and saw them once a year AFTER you moved away, abandoning them to live happily ever after with the woman you had an affair with. You couldn't even be bothered to stay in the same state. All you had to offer them was this insurance plan. You left them high and dry and told them over email. Why would they want any relationship with you? Have you even asked them about the trauma you caused?", "YTA. You abandoned your daughters with someone you describe as very mentally ill. You do this by cheating on her, divorcing and leaving the area. \n\nDid you make any attempts to spend more time with them? Once a year???!!! Of course they don\u2019t trust you. The don\u2019t know you. And a handful of attempts over a couple of years isn\u2019t really trying to get to know them bub. You\u2019re a self centered ass, but you could have at least helped them in one very important way\u2026and you chose to stop doing that cause you don\u2019t want to do any work with them. You want it to be easy and it\u2019s not easy for kids to get over being abandoned by their dad. You are a huge AH", "TO recap: You had an affair, left to live with your affair partner, and left your children with a severely mentally ill single parent. But that was what was best for your children?\n\n>I am of the opinion that they need to make an effort to see my perspective and work towards forgiveness.\n\nNope. Not with the list of stuff you did. You should be wildly grateful they will even speak to you.\n\nYTA - health insurance is the least of what you owe your daughters.", "YTA, if they get seriously ill and can't afford insurance do not come on Reddit to complain about not being invited to the funeral.\n\nAlso, since you're tone deaf, do not attend the funeral with your wife/affair partner.", "YTA.  So you left your children with a woman you think was severely mentally ill, saw them once  a year after that, and you think they are the ones who owe you something?  What about your divorce necessitated you moving out of state?  If your ex-wife was so mentally ill that you think it excused your actions in having an affair, how did you convince yourself it was ok to abandon your children to her care? Removing them from your health insurance and trying to make yourself feel better by assuming there are other avenues for them to obtain coverage is just the last piece of evidence your daughters need to know you don't care about them at all.  Good for them for blocking you.", "\u2705 cheats on wife \n\u2705 blames her mental illness instead of being a true teammate and partner to help her through it \n\u2705 problematic age gap with AP twenty years younger than he is \n\u2705 abandons wife and daughters and moves away, makes no effort for custody, sees daughters once a year.

People can\u2019t just enroll in health insurance whenever the heck they want.  There are specific enrollment periods.  Do you know when the enrollment period at Jane\u2019s job is?  Can she even enroll if she\u2019s declined once?  You said her job \u201cmost likely offers an insurance package\u201d - WHICH MEANS YOU\u2019RE SUCH A TERRIBLE FATHER YOU DIDN\u2019T EVEN CHECK TO MAKE SURE.\n\nAs for Lucy - I know I can\u2019t enroll in my university\u2019s health plan in the middle of the semester.  Can Lucy?  Could she get coverage over the summer if she\u2019s not taking classes?\n\nWhat kind of vindictive AH are you?  You\u2019ve ripped heath care away from your own children.  What happens if they get sick?  \n\nI didn\u2019t have health insurance for a long time.  You know what happened when I got sick?  I suffered.  Because I sure as hell couldn\u2019t afford to go to the doctor.  That\u2019s how a spider bite on my leg developed into a staph infection that got so bad it became too painful to *walk*.  My boss had to drag me to the ER because she was afraid of what would happen to me.  I ended up needing surgery on my leg.  The infection was so bad, it literally ate away part of my leg muscle.  I still have a little crater in my leg because of it.\n\nIf I had had insurance, I could have gotten medical care as soon as I noticed the spider bite.  A few days on antibiotics and I probably would have been fine.  Instead I felt like my leg was on fire for weeks.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you can look at yourself in the mirror without vomiting, for allowing your own children to risk being put in the same position as I was.", "YTA you suck op everyone needs to go no contact with your ass", "YTA. First of all, your daughters get to decide when (and if) they get to get over you leaving them - they are the wronged party here, not you. You left them, so the onus of reestablishing trust is entirely up to you.

I ended up moving to a different state to live with Sara, divorced Amy, and married Sara a year later. I was just very unhappy in my marriage with Amy, she is an very mentally ill woman and I couldn\u2019t continue the life I had with her. I did not fight for custody, as I felt that would further hurt Jane and Lucy. I paid child support and saw them once a year per visitation agreement until they turned 18.  \n\nOver the past few years, Sara and I have really tried to reconnect and build relationships with Jane and Lucy. I have apologized for my mistakes and do everything I can to be an involved in their lives. However, neither Jane nor Lucy are interested in a relationship with us, their reasons being that I destroyed their mother\u2019s life and they will never forgive me for missing their childhoods. I understand their pain but I can\u2019t change the past and considering it\u2019s been 10 years since the divorce and the girls are adults, I am of the opinion that they need to make an effort to see my perspective and work towards forgiveness. \n\nThe current situation at hand is where I may be TA. Jane and Lucy are both under my health insurance, as their mother doesn\u2019t work. I have really good insurance through my job and we are in the US, so Jane and Lucy are technically eligible for coverage under my plan until they are 26. However, when it was time for me to re-enroll for the upcoming year, I decided to remove the girls from my plan. I find it a bit ridiculous that even though Jane and Lucy are unwilling to even attempt to have any kind of relationship with me, they have no problem benefiting from my health insurance policy that I work extremely hard for. Sara and I notified the girls of the decision over an email, and even offered to help them find new policies of their own. I know that Jane has a good job that would most likely offer an insurance package, and Lucy is in college so she could probably enroll under the university\u2019s insurance. Or, the girls could convince their mom to finally get a job so she can cover them. Jane responded to the email, saying my decision is cruel and that I have now destroyed any chance of having a relationship with either of them.\n\nIt\u2019s been several months since I removed the girls as beneficiaries and I sometimes question my decision. The girls have blocked me from their social media accounts, which has been hard for me, as it was the only way for me to be involved in their lives. I still think I made the right choice by standing my ground, but also wonder whether or not AITA?  \n\ntldr; AITA for removing my (57M) daughters (Jane 23F and Lucy 20F) from my health insurance plan after several years of low contact from them?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Seen this way too often, where men have emotional affairs and clock out from the relationship, the wives pick up on it and become mentally unhealthy because they can\u2019t figure out what the hell is going wrong for their husbands to be so absent, and then the men use their wives\u2019 mental health as an excuse to officially leave.", "Exactly!", "THIS", "For real, I wonder of they blocked him because he saw them once a year and waited until they were adults to basically say you're adults you should forgive me.", "I can't get over that he posted once a year like it was actually a custody arrangement, nah she was the parent and he swung by like Santa just seems like he didn't bring shit with him.", "You pay more for each individual on your plan, and monthly premiums can get quite expensive. That being said, it sounds like OP was just being vindicative, not frugal.", "Taking someone off your health insurance, if the girls aren\u2019t covered could mean thousands of dollars if they are hospitalized PLUS if they aren\u2019t covered they may not go to routine dr appts (ie gyno, dentist, etc). He did it out of spite. His premium (amount he pays for his plan) probably is higher with his daughters but he said they have been on it for a while\u2026basically it\u2019s a huge asshole move", "I am in a very high cost of living area. Employee contribution to employer based health insurance here usually runs about $100-200 per month for the first dependent, substantially less for numbers 2+ (after the employer's  pcontribution). It is not considered taxable income.\n\nSo not cheap, but OP does not seem to have an issue with affording it. He cut them off to be a dick and punish them, which makes him YTA.\n\nOP I hope neither of your children develops any serious health issues, because your actions are putting them at serious risk.", "The cut off for having your children on your insurance plans is usually 25 after that you start paying more. \n\nThe rule is there as then your children dont have to spend alot of money on health care for atleast 2 years after they finish school", "At my last 2 jobs, if I had just 2 children added on to my plan, it did not cost me more.  If I added a spouse plus 1 child, maybe $300 more a month.  I had 4 children on my plan so it was the family plan & was maybe $500 more.  Employer paid part if it.  The job before, I still had 5 children on my plan & it was $1200 per month for the entire policy (health, vision, dental & orthodontics).  I paid for the entire plan. \n\nThe last plan was a high deductible savings plan. Which means I paid for everything up to $4800 & then they started covering expenses (I think that went up to $5200 per year).  So that is why it was cheaper.  The previous one, I paid very small deductibles for each visit with an annual maximum out of pocket of $1000 per person, $2500 per family.", "He asked if he s TA for insurance thing not for complaining.", "Not a parent, and not particularly selfish (I hope).  But I still wouldn't feed the proverbial hand that bit me.  I continue to think the OP acted reasonably.", "And that insurance literally cost him nothing. It's an extra perk of a job he would have either way.\n\nYTA OP for abandoning your children to a mentally unwell mother (if that bit is true) and then doing quite literally the absolute minimum you could do... and now, at no cost to you either way, even less.", "It's crazy how she was so mentally ill he had to leave....but not too mentally ill to raise 2 seemingly successful daughters? Seems like someone just wanted the other woman more.", "Bingo", "Ya im probably getting banned cause of this one.....I tried lol", "Kinda seems like he purposely waited so he could use the excuse of you're adults you should understand to try and avoid actually having to make up for what he did.", "How mentally ill was she really If she raised 2 seemingly successful daughters, not saying it isn't possible but seems more likely she was probably a hell of a mom who made up for a deadbeat.", "Seeing as the current wife was fully complicit in helping this guy destroy his marriage, abandon his daughters and leave them with a mentally ill (in his words) mother when the girls were small, I'm pretty sure she doesn't really give a crap about them now. She's obviously not a reliable judge of moral or ethical behaviour", "I don\u2019t think little Miss Side Chick (excuse me 2nd wife) doesn\u2019t care since she willingly got involved with a married man with young children. They\u2019re both AHs.", "OMG you\u2019re good with words \ud83d\ude02 I hope OP reads this", "Well done.  \n\nAdd something about him wanting to establish a relationship with him AND his wife, the woman who he cheated with that ended his married & he moved so far away with that he could only see them once a year.  Instead of just him & his daughters.", "Wish I had an award to give you", "But, but it\u2019s been TEN years, surely by now they\u2019re over the scars OP inflicted willy, nilly! YTA OP. Big time.", "The visits once a year hurt his case as well. I get divorce and might not get the custody agreement you want but not even doing the every other weekend is just being lazy. YTA", "I\u2019m betting she wasn\u2019t mentally ill - just a younger model showed up.", "My partner of seven years left me 1.5 years into my chronic illness. Turned out to be a blessing in disguise", "I have a 13 and 10 yr old now.  They ALREADY struggle with mental health issues thanks to COVID (F COVID).  I can\u2019t IMAGINE what would happen to them if their dad cheated on me with a woman half my age, divorced me, moved across the country, and didn\u2019t want custody of them. I think it would destroy them.  I\u2019m talking unaliving kind of destroy.  I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be alive 10 yrs later to even GET an apology.  Not that ANY apology would be enough for that kind of behavior.  Not even close.\n\nOP, your daughters are strong women who survived a horribly TRAUMATIC experience that YOU put them through and you think ONE apology is enough or that you have ANY right to DEMAND that they \u201cconsider your point of view\u201d?  You\u2019re lucky that they even TALK to you.  And kicking them off your insurance because they are strong, independent women (because YOU forced them to be), who make up their own minds and have decided to hold YOU accountable for YOUR sh$tty choices instead of little robots that you can program to worship you regardless?  That\u2019s the tiny turd topping on the vomit icing on the sh$t cake that you\u2019ve served them for the last 10 YEARS.\n\nYTA, in case it isn\u2019t BLINDINGLY obvious.", "Also why he \u201chad\u201d to cheat on her. I mean, what else do you expect him to do? Obviously the cheating is really her fault.", "Yep, this pretty much sums up my FIL right there. I\u2019m so glad my sweet MIL found her awesome boyfriend and is living her best life, she finally gets to experience what it\u2019s like to have a good partner.", "I wouldn't blame them. The way he ripped their family up and then barely had anything to do with them for a decade isn't something that goes away with a simple \"I'm sorry, all is good now.\"", "It's like the exaggeration of that guy that says all his ex girlfriends were crazy...as if he wasn't the common denominator.", "It is SO hard to read this guy and stay civil.", "I was thinking the same thing.", "Those poor girls \nI feel so bad for what they went through", "Right!  My ex married a wonderful woman. Perfect for him.  When she married his dad, one of the first things she did was find out what his annual medical expenses were & got me a debit card to use for all of my out of pocket expenses.  She also added him to her insurance. He was already insured by me & his dad but I always paid all out of pocket expenses.  When he had eye exams & was getting new glasses, she asked to come, not to push her desires on my son but to make sure he got the best of what was available & she paid the bill.  When he needed goggle type glasses for baseball (he had poor vision), she paid for the entire bill.  \n\nThat is what a great step mom does.  Treats the child as one of her own even though there is an existing mom.", "OP will say I wonder who they are talking about", "Yes. He AND Sara want a relationship. He AND Sara sent an email cutting off their insurance. Sara should have no part in this except to stay in the background and forever hang her head in shame for having any role in breaking up the family. Obviously OP deserves even more disdain heaped onto him than Sara since these are his girls he left behind, but he should be the one going to these girls, alone, on his hands and knees to rebuild anything before Sara even enters the conversation\n\nAnd here is my ATA for OP.", "Right he never wanted to be a parent. He just wanted to move on with his new life. I hope those girls stay NC with him, he doesn\u2019t deserve a relationship with them.", "Something tells me his explanation to them was along the lines of I had to because of your mom, I didn't go to court and fight to see you more cause your mom's crazy, I bailed cause your mons crazy, and my favorite line among people like this, I paid child support so I helped in a way.", "I've never seen visitation agreement used with such a singular meaning before, who agrees to once a year.", "Like he doesn\u2019t have the balls to be accountable for these actions alone."]}
