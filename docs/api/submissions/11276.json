I thought before the trip he was OK. But when we got to Magic Kingdom he began to get on our nerves. Saying inappropriate jokes loudly and repeatedly. Even when he was told to stop. Then at dinner he said stuff about our mom that was not ok. I should have said something then but I just was not in the mood. When we were watching the fireworks he was screaming at us to move faster so he would not miss the bus. The last straw was when he began to scream at my sister calling her names and just putting her down. She was crying. I saw red and snapped at him. I told him we invited him and he does not have the right to treat anyone let alone my sister or any member of my family that way. He then called me a retard (I'm autistic) and that because I'm 32 I need to grow up. That set my sister off and she threw him off the trip. Got him off the hotel rooms, off the park reservations, and the other dining reservations. We had to get him removed from the property by security. While we were at EPCOT I got a message from him saying I ruined his first trip to Disney and he was looking forward to this. He also recently messaged me saying I'm the reason my sister broke up with him.  \n\nSo guys aita?", "created_utc": 1677757009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g0luv/aita_for_going_off_on_sisters_bf_and_getting_him/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just gave your sister the courage to do it because fighting for herself she convinced herself she was overreacting but when he went after you she realized how unacceptable his behavior was", "He is an ah clearly. You did the right thing. NTA.", "Nta!", "NTA\nHe's the reason your sister broke up with him.\n\nNot surprising that you can add \"doesn't take responsibility for his actions\" to the list of reasons your sister is better off without him. The treatment of her that you witnessed is domestic abuse.\n\nDon't give him another moment of your consideration, well done to you and your sister.", "NTA at all! I hope he doesn\u2019t sweet talk to your sister into getting back with him when she leaves the trip, but you probably did the best thing for her by pointing out how abusive and ungrateful he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
