I thought before the trip he was OK. But when we got to Magic Kingdom he began to get on our nerves. Saying inappropriate jokes loudly and repeatedly. Even when he was told to stop. Then at dinner he said stuff about our mom that was not ok. I should have said something then but I just was not in the mood. When we were watching the fireworks he was screaming at us to move faster so he would not miss the bus. The last straw was when he began to scream at my sister calling her names and just putting her down. She was crying. I saw red and snapped at him. I told him we invited him and he does not have the right to treat anyone let alone my sister or any member of my family that way. He then called me a retard (I'm autistic) and that because I'm 32 I need to grow up. That set my sister off and she threw him off the trip. Got him off the hotel rooms, off the park reservations, and the other dining reservations. We had to get him removed from the property by security. While we were at EPCOT I got a message from him saying I ruined his first trip to Disney and he was looking forward to this. He also recently messaged me saying I'm the reason my sister broke up with him.  \n\nSo guys aita?\n\nEdit: sister came clean afterward telling me that his behavior was typical. He's called her fat, said she's stupid, she'd fail as a nurse.

Sounds to me like your sister came to realize what kind of person he was after he verbally abused you and it's often the case that women who are abused will value themselves less than those they care about.

It sounds like everyone was joking and having a nice time, you read the situation wrong, caused a conflict and then it spiraled from there.

Thanks ;-)", "I won't. I'm just glad she left him. She deserves better than that guy.  She also found out he stole at the airport a headphone bag with a passport. She found it in their apartment. Asked him and he said he just picked it up. She's contacted the person saying if he wants to press charges to go ahead and she'll get it back to him.", "That is wild.
