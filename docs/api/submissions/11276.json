Your behavior was the total opposite of being an asshole. Good on ya.", "Do you really need to ask?", "so your behavior helped give your sister the courage to leave her abuser. what he was doing was emotional abuse and what likely caused her to snap was it was totally cool for her to be abused but for you, her sibling, to take the brunt of it was out of line.\n\nNTA\n\nside story\nmy autistic husband could literally be abused and he would take it but the second his siblings are it's kid gloves off. trying to get him to understand that things that make him uncomfortable are not ok is a challenge. Like someone once called him the femal version of his name, he doesn't like it but it's been that way since he was a kid and is a running \"joke\" and well this time my family saw it and were so upset.\n\nwhen i sat him down to explain i asked would he be ok with someone doing that to our oldest. would that be ok and it was an absolute no. he couldn't use that same logic for himself though. some folks are just like that.", " Nta I\u2019m glad you and your sister stuck up for each other in that moment. She deserves better.", "NTA. If you haven't blocked him yet, just reply \"Lol\" or \"Good\" to all his whining.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you block his number?", "It's so annoying when people make posts so obviously seeking adulation rather than actually wanting to know if they are TA.", "Absolutely nta, he would've been gone after the first time he was told to stop and didn't.

They don't deserve each other--him because he shouldn't have someone so good, and her because she should have better.", "NTA.  And if you are the reason she broke up with him, good job!", "You\u2019re def not the A-hole. Lord. Great job to both you and your sister for having each other\u2019s backs! He sounds like a real treat. Ya know\u2026cussing and calling people names and belittling them. Abusive AF. Plus, I think it\u2019s particularly interesting that he told you to grow up when he himself is 30. And, I\u2019m just gonna say it because that donkey beret won\u2019t: I am so SO sorry someone called you that. I\u2019m also neurodivergent (ADHD) and I know slurs like that can hurt like Hell. I hope the rest of y\u2019all\u2019s Disney vacation went super well! Cheers! And, I hope your sister finds herself a partner who is worthy of her in the future. If she wants.", "Clearly, you are NTA. Good riddance to that jackass! I hope the rest of the trip was better!", "NTA. Good on you. Also good to hear that your sister dropped this toxic ass.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to even ask.", "You aren't in the wrong, but your sister should have dumped this guy long ago; or at least had the guts to kick him out before you had to speak up. He sounds like a total jerk and isn't worth another thought. Good for you (autistic or not :) that you spoke up! I'm glad you did!", "NTA\n\nGlad your sister broke up with him. It's nice to see sisters having each other's back.\n\nEdit for grammar.", "He called you immature, but is a full  grown adult upset over his first Disney trip? \n\nNTA he needed to go. You did her a favor.", "Lmao, hope your sister tossed him out permanently.  Only he ruined his trip.  He could have gone back to the hotel by himself instead of rushing you and your sister. He could have not be an absolute ah about the women in your family.  But he did, so this is on him. NTA", "NTA - he was abusing you both. You are both better off without him around.", "Good job sticking up for you and your family.", "NTA\n\nGlad you and your sister have each other. Maybe it took her seeing him verbally abuse you go her to acknowledge he abused her too.", "NTA don't you love when other people behave like absolute monsters, suffer consequences, and then say it's all YOUR fault?  No buddy, acting like an ass ruined his trip.\n\nI'm so glad your sister dumped him, just sorry she put up with it before that.  Maybe treating her that way in front of other people, and seeing you stand up for her, was the final straw.", "NTA. Your sister is lucky to have you. You have her back.", "NTA, and neither is your sister for finally standing up to this monster.", "NTA. Your sister deserves better and honestly, sounds like it won\u2019t take much to be better than him.", "Any time *Disney World* security has to be called in, you know someone is clowning. Your sister's ex (thankfully) is the reason they're no longer together.  He's abusive, a boor, and doesn't know how to behave in public, especially at a place like Disney World. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he was a loser.  Good riddance.", "NTA\n\nBut f one takes the description you make literally, his behavior would\u2019ve made him be expelled from any place specially Disney parks. \n\nOr maybe the dude doesn\u2019t actually scream when saying all those horrible things but you wrote it for increase impact. Not needed. Abuse is often polite. It\u2019s still abuse and can be more damaging.\n\nBut one question though. We aren\u2019t in 1947 and your sister wasn\u2019t married to him? Why put up with all that crap?", "NTA.", "NTA\nHe did this to himself and is just placing blame anywhere but himself. Usually what people like him do.", "NTA, HE is the reason your sister broke up with him. You're a wonderful sibling for standing up for her. That might have been what she needed to see through the fog. I hope you and your family were able to enjoy yourselves after he left.", "NTA. Your sister's boyfriend is the reason she broke up with him and him making fun of your family and sister, plus making fun of your autism is just horrible. He is a sadistic clown and I hope you and your sister are doing better \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

I ruined his first trip to Disney and he was looking forward to this.\n\nHe's only 30 years old and acting like this? He's the one that needs to grow up. FFS.\n\nNo, OP, you are NTA. In any possible way.", ">He also recently messaged me saying I'm the reason my sister broke up with him.\n\nIf so, then you should be proud of that. NTA.", "NTA.  At all. \n\nMaybe that trip turned out to be a blessing in disguise - your sister may have never told you how he actually was until you saw it for yourself. And she likely didn't feel like she could stand up to him, until you did. There's absolutely nothing wrong with what you did or said, and ultimately it was her decision to boot him from the trip and break up.\n\nYou both made the right call here, he's just mad that he has to deal with the consequences of his own shitty actions.", "NTA. From what I've seen, you have done your sister a huge favor.", "Why are you even asking? Of course you're not. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your sister. NTA and really, Tom is. You did her a favor and no one needs that kinda nonsense on their lives.", "NTA. Being abusive EVEN ONCE is enough to kick his buns to the curb. I'm glad your sister ditched him. He ruined his own vacation, he would have finished it out if he had acted like a grown up instead of a childish jerk. And it sounds like you probably improved the vacation of a  LOT more people who now don't have to hear this guy yelling and being rude and inappropriate in the parks.", "NYA", "NTA. Probably you are the reason she had the courage to do this finally. If anything, you gotta be proud of yourselves for stepping up.", "You definitely didn't deal with it well.\n\nThis sub is bad because it's all or nothing generally. Either you're an asshole and the guy is a total victim or you're a total victim and the guy is an asshole.\n\nHe qasnt right to yell at your sister, but freaking out at him isn't the best way to resolve that. It would have been much better if things could have been talked down instead of screaming and escalating things. \n\nWhat did he say about your Mom that was not okay?\n\nSince you are autistic I think its important to remember that you view things through a different lens", "NTA. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s the AH.", "Why did you post this? You know you're NTA. The guy was a jackass", "NTA you just helped your sister see his abuse and that she didn't need to put up with it.", "Actually I would say he is right, OP is absolutely the reason her sister broke up with him. Because her sister was aware till now of his behaviour but was not able to come out of it. Even during the trip he was able to break down the sister. When he turned against the OP, it gave the sister a push she needed and hence was able to stand up for herself and get away from this toxic man. OP you did your sister a huge favour!
