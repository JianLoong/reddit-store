I hope you guys are staying safe because who knows how far this guy will go", "nta", ">While we were at EPCOT I got a message from him saying I ruined his first trip to Disney and he was looking forward to this. He also recently messaged me saying I'm the reason my sister broke up with him\n\nText back \"Good.\"\n\n(Don't *really* do that, you should just ignore him. But DO save those texts in case any member of your family needs a restraining order against this guy later on!)", "NTA for sure!!! Thanks for standing up for your sister! She may never have been able to get away from him if this hadn't happened. He is a manipulator. It's not YOUR responsibility to ensure he has a great first experience at Disney. It's HIS responsibility to not be an AH.", "She should send it back using certified mail. And then send the person all the paperwork from it so they can use it to press charges.", "Yup! Lock smiths can re-key a lot pretty easily", "You are today's hero, for me.  I hate that you had to go through all that abuse, but impressed that you turned it into gold for other people.", "I hope you a,l enjoyed the rest of your trip when the loser left.", "NTA. NOBODY gets to ruin a Disney trip. This is why I refuse to go with anyone but hubby and kids when we go every few months.", "NTA *you* didn\u2019t get him kicked out of your trip, nor are you the reason your sister broke up with him - *his behavior* is the cause of all of that.", "NTA. good job standing up for yourself and your sister. Sounds like he was bad news from the start and she will be much much better off without him. I hope the two of you enjoyed the rest of your Disney trip without him.", "NTA. Well done you, for helping strengthen your sister's resolve. Your rebuke of the bf gave her the real-world context she needed. She's probably been silently baulking at his abuse for some time, but your outside view helped her see just how messed up his treatment of her really was. Hero sis stepped up!", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry he spoke to you and your sister that way. I hope she leaves his ass in the dust. Absolutely gross behavior!", "NTA. Good thing you did it. Your sister needed a wake up call.", "YOU ARE ABSAFUCKINGLUTELY NOT THE ASSHOLE. he called you the r-slur knowing you're autistic (I'm also autistic btw) and that's beyond fucked up. Good riddance to that vile piece of human excrement", "NTA. I'm glad you stuck up for your sister.", "NTA- that is all.", "Absolutely NTA, you're a hero! Also, well done to your sister for having the courage to leave - it's hard to see your worth when you're in the middle of a relationship like that.", "Well actually I would give OP some credit, well more OPs relationship with her sister. But this is a good thing, OPs relationship to her sister saved her sister from a lot of future abuse. A lot of people have a hard time putting a stop when they are abused, but if their abuser targets someone they love they finally snap out of it.\n\nSo even though it was uncomfortable it was a good thing. I hope your sister shares this kind of thing more with you OP, you have her back and she has yours.\n\nSo feel proud, the love your sister and you shared saved her from this major AH. \n\nNTA.", "How did he think that he could get away with it in front of her family? Did he just get arrogant?", "I\u2019m happy for your sister. I hope you enjoyed your trip despite this ass hat. :D", "Oh yes.. you are absolutely right.. you see he completely got what he deserved. But more often than not it gets hard for people to take right decision for themselves and they end up enduring pain than they should. In this Op turned out to be great support for sister to think clearly. We are both saying the exact same thing with different angles.", "Guess most of Manhattan, including my grandmother, is yellow flags, JFL.", "Not gold. Maybe some shitty pearls though.\n\nWhat's heartbreaking is the night outreach vans, when we start running low on supplies.\n\nJust clean socks! Just clean socks y'all! \n\nAnd a ham and cheese sandwich on cheap white bread, and a bottle of water.\n\nThat's it y'all!\n\nNo, we're out of blankets, I'm sorry.\n\nI know it's cold, I'm sorry, socks are all we have left.\n\nI know....shit...\n\n...here...\n\n*seven volunteers, a driver, and two staff all take their coats/hats/gloves off and pass them out to people shivering in the snow*\n\nAnd then half of us cried all the way back to garage two, because we all know it's not fucking enough.", "NTA", "NTA. He is just a waste of skin and time. Your sister doesn't deserve to be treated like that and neither do you. He attempted to ruin the trip by making everything about him, plus being abusive to you and your sister. \n\nGood for you standing up to him and your sister for dumping him.", "NTA That guy is a jerk. It took your sister seeing you offended and protective of her to realize how bad things really were. You did everything right. She needed to face to truth and leave that creep.", "NTA. Sister, you are a bad ass for standing up to him the way you did. You may not think so, but you were probably the final push your sister needed to kick that abuser to the curb. \n\nFWIW I have never been to Disney World so I am very jealous that ya'll went. But I do recommend a Disney Cruise, expensive as all hell, but fun for Disnerds like your family and ours!", "NTA, and you facilitated a long overdue break up.\n\n          \nAlso, his behavior, not yours, is the reason your sister broke up with him.", "He got himself kicked off the trip. You and your sister both made the right call, eventually in your sister\u2019s case. She needed to have dropped him much sooner if he was abusive. . Edit fir verdict: NTA.", "If he told me I was the reason my sister broke up with I\u2019d tell him how proud I am of my accomplishment", "I don\u2019t speak to doormats like you.", "What do you mean, you TRY. You\u2019re doing an incredible job to make sure other people don\u2019t have to go through the same things you did. You should be really proud of yourself.", "Unfortunately, every day I am continually confronted with what little effect my labor really has.\n\nThere will be hundreds needing help, and only three of us on staff, and what little we have is used up so quickly, and it's all gone again by tomorrow.\n\nWhen you've got a guy who's wet from his own urine, wearing almost nothing in an alley while the snow is falling and you have no blankets...\n\nShit. Sorry. I've had a rough week. So much narcan."]}
