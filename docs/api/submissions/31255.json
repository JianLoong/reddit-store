{"id": 31255, "submission_id": "17ypja3", "title": "AITA for calling my daughter-in-law\u2019s parents deadbeats and not stepping down in my place at her wedding?", "selftext": "When my son, \u201cJosh\u201d, was 16, he and his girlfriend, \u201cChloe\u201d, told my wife and I that they were expecting a baby. We were reasonably concerned and upset, but supported the two in whatever they wanted to do. They decided they wanted to keep the baby.\n\nChloe\u2019s parents were not supportive at all and kicked her out of the house. We had her move in with us. My wife and I developed a close bond with her as we helped her prepare for the baby. After the birth of their daughter, \u201cBrynn\u201d, Chloe and Josh lived with us until they were 22. As they were so young, we really helped a lot those first few years as they got their GEDs, went to trade school, etc. It was not an easy road in the slightest, but it made us all closer. I consider Chloe the daughter I never had. They are now 25 and Brynn is 9.\n\nLast year, Chloe\u2019s parents got in contact with her and said that they were sorry, they wanted to be in their lives, etc. Josh and Chloe chose to hesitantly let them in their daughter\u2019s life. They have definitely played the part of overcompensating grandparents, who try to pretend no time has passed. Brynn is healthy, safe and loved, that\u2019s all that matters. They have been stand-offish with my wife and I. \n\nI feel they are jealous and maybe insecure when it comes to how close we are to Chloe and Brynn. We\u2019ve tried to arrange for times to talk, outings where all 4 of us can be with Brynn, etc, they always rebuff. So, we\u2019ve settled to be polite and kind, getting along with them for Brynn,Chloe and Josh\u2019s benefit. \n\nChloe and Josh have recently announced they\u2019re getting married. She asked me to walk her down the aisle. She explained that while her dad is too, she\u2019d love to have \u201cher other dad\u201d with her. I was touched. She has called me \u201cPapa Sam\u201d for awhile now (and my wife, \u201cMama Carol\u201d), but I still didn\u2019t expect this. I accepted.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s dad is refusing to walk her down the aisle because I will. He says that I am encroaching on a precious moment between him and his daughter. I said so long as Chloe wants me to walk her, I will. Chloe has said she doesn\u2019t want me to step down, but also wants her dad there. I\u2019ve said I\u2019ll support what she wants. She\u2019s remained firm that she wants to try to find a way to get her dad on board so we\u2019ll both walk her.\n\nChloe\u2019s mom said I should step down, because of course Chloe won\u2019t ask me to. I made a comment about how then I\u2019d be just as much of a deadbeat as they were for so long. This pissed her and her husband off.\n\nMy wife feels I\u2019ve fueled this drama and I should just step down so Chloe can have both her parents there. I\u2019ve said until Chloe asks me to step down, I won\u2019t.

He just doesn't want to have to explain to people why Chloe is getting walked down the aisle by two people and he's trying to blackmail with refusing to walk her down the aisle, and he's throwing a temper tantrum now that you're not abiding by his demands. \n\nGuy like this will probably cave in the end, it's clear that he's the kind of person who cares a lot about putting on a good face, and it'll look even worse for him if he's not even walking her down at all.", "NTA- They are trash parents who do not deserve such a wonderful daughter and grandson. At the end of the day it is Chole's choice so you should always respect that. I would also suggest you be on guard as they will try to remove you and your wife's voice in all the wedding planning and will possibly try to agitate the whole situation seeking to have you removed from the wedding.", "NTA - Chloe has said what she wants. It\u2019s up to Chloe to enforce her wants and boundaries. Her parents don\u2019t want to make a public display of their mistreatment of her. Well that fucking sucks for them, should\u2019ve thought about that before they abandoned their daughter. Chloe is blessed to have you. \n\nLet these people choke on their shame.\n\nCongrats to your son and Chloe, as well as you and yours!", "NTA - Chloe's parents KICKED HER OUT at 16. They deserve to feel bad.", "You're NTA. They're lucky she even allows them into her life after kicking her out of their home when she was still a child. Chloe obviously has a tremendous capacity for forgiveness towards her biological parents, yet is realistic and grateful enough to recognize that you're her parents as well.\n\nHer parents ought to just be grateful they are permitted to be in their lives and attend the wedding.", "You're choosing what Chloe wants. Her bio-father is choosing his pride. Only one of you actually loves that young woman and wants to see her happy.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Chloe\u2019s dad is creating a problem and people are looking at you to solve it. This is her dad\u2019s issue and it will be Chloe\u2019s call to make and it sounds like she\u2019s already made it: she wants you both.", "NTA you were there when her parents abandoned her. Now the tough part is over they want to pretend their actions don't have consequences. One of them is Chloe wanting you to walk her down the aisle.", "OP please make sure to tell Chloe and your son to set up code words or passwords with every wedding vendor. I might be paranoid but I wouldn't be surprised to see a later post where her parents tried to change something out of spite or to try to make you look bad. \n\nI personally feel you are right in saying you will do what Chloe wants. If you ever talk to her parents remind them you are the one that took in Chloe when they kicked out a 16 yr old pregnant girl, so now they are seeing some of the consequences for those actions.", "You made it a point to check with Chloe to ask what she wants you to do. As long as you continue to try and honor her wishes, you are NTA", "NTA - Don't allow their 'asks' or comments rattle you to respond cause it is what they want. Allowing Chloe to decide is the way to go. Your jab at the mom...did it make you feel good? You worked hard to build relations. You built relations out of love, empathy, patience and giving.  You have forever changed the trajectory of the kids  & gkid) lives. Many don't know an adult like you.", "NTA because I totally understand where you're coming from and I would find it hard to bite my tongue. But calling her parents names may hurt Chloe which I'm sure you're not intending. You do not owe them anything other than aloof politeness when you have to be around them. The rest you should leave up to Chloe and take her lead.", "*Now, Chloe\u2019s dad is refusing to walk her down the aisle because I will. He says that I am encroaching on a precious moment between him and his daughter.*\n\n**NTA - He is encroaching not you. He lost any rights to precious moments when he threw her out.** \n\nChloe asked you because you and your wife were there when she was most vulnerable and have accepted her into your home and lives and made sure she, your son and their child had a safe place to be. You have every right to walk her down that aisle even more so than her bio dad.  He should be grateful to you for taking is daughter in and making sure she was okay after he threw a pregnant 16 year old out.", "NTA. Any parent who truly loves their child would be happy they had love and support when they needed it. They're embarrassed by their behaviour, trying to sweep it under the rug, and being hostile to people who have been nothing but good to their daughter. They are prioritising their egos over their daughter's happiness.", "NTA. I think it's so special that Chloe wants to honor you in this way.  You've told her it's okay for you to not do it so dad can, and she's told you no way so that's that.  And as far as the deadbeat comment, truth hurts.  They abandoned their 16yo child when she was most vulnerable and needed them the most.  They were MIA for almost a decade.  You reap what you sow.", "You have indeed fueled the drama... that's obvious!\n\nYou're definitely NTA though.
