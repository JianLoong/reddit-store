We were reasonably concerned and upset, but supported the two in whatever they wanted to do. They decided they wanted to keep the baby.\n\nChloe\u2019s parents were not supportive at all and kicked her out of the house. We had her move in with us. My wife and I developed a close bond with her as we helped her prepare for the baby. After the birth of their daughter, \u201cBrynn\u201d, Chloe and Josh lived with us until they were 22. As they were so young, we really helped a lot those first few years as they got their GEDs, went to trade school, etc. It was not an easy road in the slightest, but it made us all closer. I consider Chloe the daughter I never had. They are now 25 and Brynn is 9.\n\nLast year, Chloe\u2019s parents got in contact with her and said that they were sorry, they wanted to be in their lives, etc. Josh and Chloe chose to hesitantly let them in their daughter\u2019s life. They have definitely played the part of overcompensating grandparents, who try to pretend no time has passed. Brynn is healthy, safe and loved, that\u2019s all that matters. They have been stand-offish with my wife and I. \n\nI feel they are jealous and maybe insecure when it comes to how close we are to Chloe and Brynn. We\u2019ve tried to arrange for times to talk, outings where all 4 of us can be with Brynn, etc, they always rebuff. So, we\u2019ve settled to be polite and kind, getting along with them for Brynn,Chloe and Josh\u2019s benefit. \n\nChloe and Josh have recently announced they\u2019re getting married. She asked me to walk her down the aisle. She explained that while her dad is too, she\u2019d love to have \u201cher other dad\u201d with her. I was touched. She has called me \u201cPapa Sam\u201d for awhile now (and my wife, \u201cMama Carol\u201d), but I still didn\u2019t expect this. I accepted.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s dad is refusing to walk her down the aisle because I will. He says that I am encroaching on a precious moment between him and his daughter. I said so long as Chloe wants me to walk her, I will. Chloe has said she doesn\u2019t want me to step down, but also wants her dad there. I\u2019ve said I\u2019ll support what she wants. She\u2019s remained firm that she wants to try to find a way to get her dad on board so we\u2019ll both walk her.\n\nChloe\u2019s mom said I should step down, because of course Chloe won\u2019t ask me to. I made a comment about how then I\u2019d be just as much of a deadbeat as they were for so long. This pissed her and her husband off.\n\nMy wife feels I\u2019ve fueled this drama and I should just step down so Chloe can have both her parents there.

Without drama.\n\nThe ceremony was 15 minutes, each father was the witness for the other kid, welcoming them into the families this way. We had a BBQ and everyone was in bed by 10 because we were pooped.\n\nIt was beautiful.  Utterly beautiful.\n\nDaughter and fiance had chosen this because they had decided that I was being the only freakin' ADULT and they only wanted adults at their wedding.  So, they invited those who honestly wished only for their happiness on their wedding day.

If anything, it's more likely that she feels guilty and is being a \"bad daughter\" if she doesn't let him share in this milestone moment.\n\nI felt that way about my biological Dad too, like I had to tell him first about milestones because he wasn't around, and it wasn't until I was 27 hanging out with my wife and her family that they made me realize, I wasn't failing and being a bad son, but my dad had actually failed me and I took that into adulthood.\n\nOP needs to let it play out.

It is a testament to your relationship with them that they stayed together and she now wants you to be a key figure in her wedding ceremony.\n\nIt is also understandable that Chloe would want to reconcile with her parents.  Its always a complex situation when someone has had dysfunctional relationships in their birth family.  Part of you is angry, part of you wants to repair and be the family you had always dreamed of having.   It sounds like this might be the point where Chloe is in her life right now.  \n\nIt sounds like you are being resoectful of her decision, but the biodad may be envious that you are probably perceived as more of a father figure than he is.  He wants to impress others, as if there hadn't been the huge gap where he abandoned his daughter.  And most likely, does want to reclaim that role in his daughters life (albeit, too late)\n\nUltimately, I agree that you should remain on point unless Chloe asks you to step down.

Do point out that if she chooses to have her bio dad walk her down the aisle, he and her mother are likely to see the win and push for even more until you and your wife are completely out of the wedding (in other words, not even allowed entry, invite or not) and then completely out of their lives. Tell her that you\u2019re sorry to be so blunt and negative about the situation, especially since she is in the middle of stressful wedding prep, but that it needs to be said.

After all, it's their wedding.  But a compromise could be to do a processional, rather than Josh standing at the alter....  He goes down first with you and your wife following him, she then comes down with her parents following her....  and instead of her being \"given away\" both sets of parents answer \"we do\" after being asked \"who stands in support of this union?\".

But that being said you were telling the truth but let's move on to the bigger picture here period you were chosen for that honor for a reason and that reason was because you were there and you supported them not just financially but emotionally when they were in a bad spot . You did what you did for unselfish reasons because you thought it was the right thing to do period no argument there. I think that I am a good authority on this subject because I faced a very similar situation. My daughter was born under similar circumstances and due to her mother's parents I was not able to be in her life until she was 16. So when it came time for her to get married her stepfather who was really not even that close to her thought he should have the honor of walking her down the aisle. Obviously I was hoping she would choose me but I did not force the subject because it was her big day not mine. In the end she chose her uncle because growing up he was the closest thing she had to a father by her own statement. So when all this discussion started right off the bat I knew what the best thing to do would be to tell her I'll respect whatever decision you make and that's that. So to make a long story short she chose her uncle and even though I was disappointed I never expressed any of that to her I just accepted her decision because in the end her happiness was more important to me. And to be honest she did have a valid point so that made it easier to accept the decision whether I really liked it or not. In the end her mother ended up divorcing The Stepfather so he would have been a bad choice but at the same time I didn't feel it was fair for me to put her in the position to choose me. Do I regret that she didn't choose me? Yes I do but at the same time I understand and I'm okay with it because it was about her not me on that day. A compromise was offered and it was for the best of everybody so I accepted it and so should they in my opinion. But I don't think you're ever going to see that because those people are more worried about their own image instead of their daughters happiness. I think the best answer here is the answer that you gave that you will accept whatever decision she makes and there will be no hard feelings. All that proves is that you really do care about this girl just as much you care about your son and your grandchild. No matter what decision is made somebody's not going to be happy but let her make that decision and then you know you did the right thing. If you pull out because everybody else thinks you should then in effect you're abandoning in her on her big day that's how she will feel I believe. You've always been there for her and if she wants you there for her now then there's absolutely no reason you should not be. She's not even your daughter and you're putting her desires before yours that's what her biological father should be doing. They have no one to blame but themselves for the fact that she calls you and your wife mom and dad. They need to learn to live with the problem that they created instead of trying to create more problems. In my opinion stand your ground let her make the decision just tell her whatever she decides you'll support her 100% no matter what.
