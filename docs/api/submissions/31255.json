We were reasonably concerned and upset, but supported the two in whatever they wanted to do. They decided they wanted to keep the baby.\n\nChloe\u2019s parents were not supportive at all and kicked her out of the house. We had her move in with us. My wife and I developed a close bond with her as we helped her prepare for the baby. After the birth of their daughter, \u201cBrynn\u201d, Chloe and Josh lived with us until they were 22. As they were so young, we really helped a lot those first few years as they got their GEDs, went to trade school, etc. It was not an easy road in the slightest, but it made us all closer. I consider Chloe the daughter I never had. They are now 25 and Brynn is 9.\n\nLast year, Chloe\u2019s parents got in contact with her and said that they were sorry, they wanted to be in their lives, etc. Josh and Chloe chose to hesitantly let them in their daughter\u2019s life. They have definitely played the part of overcompensating grandparents, who try to pretend no time has passed. Brynn is healthy, safe and loved, that\u2019s all that matters. They have been stand-offish with my wife and I. \n\nI feel they are jealous and maybe insecure when it comes to how close we are to Chloe and Brynn. We\u2019ve tried to arrange for times to talk, outings where all 4 of us can be with Brynn, etc, they always rebuff. So, we\u2019ve settled to be polite and kind, getting along with them for Brynn,Chloe and Josh\u2019s benefit. \n\nChloe and Josh have recently announced they\u2019re getting married. She asked me to walk her down the aisle. She explained that while her dad is too, she\u2019d love to have \u201cher other dad\u201d with her. I was touched. She has called me \u201cPapa Sam\u201d for awhile now (and my wife, \u201cMama Carol\u201d), but I still didn\u2019t expect this. I accepted.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s dad is refusing to walk her down the aisle because I will. He says that I am encroaching on a precious moment between him and his daughter. I said so long as Chloe wants me to walk her, I will. Chloe has said she doesn\u2019t want me to step down, but also wants her dad there. I\u2019ve said I\u2019ll support what she wants. She\u2019s remained firm that she wants to try to find a way to get her dad on board so we\u2019ll both walk her.\n\nChloe\u2019s mom said I should step down, because of course Chloe won\u2019t ask me to. I made a comment about how then I\u2019d be just as much of a deadbeat as they were for so long. This pissed her and her husband off.\n\nMy wife feels I\u2019ve fueled this drama and I should just step down so Chloe can have both her parents there.

Without drama.\n\nThe ceremony was 15 minutes, each father was the witness for the other kid, welcoming them into the families this way. We had a BBQ and everyone was in bed by 10 because we were pooped.\n\nIt was beautiful.  Utterly beautiful.\n\nDaughter and fiance had chosen this because they had decided that I was being the only freakin' ADULT and they only wanted adults at their wedding.  So, they invited those who honestly wished only for their happiness on their wedding day.  That narrowed the list down to immediate family, who were prepared to sacrifice for their happiness.\n\nThey announced their marriage, by phone, the day after, to all who should know.

Those people still can't seem to unkink from their graceless behavior when their own daughter was pregnant and begain raising her baby.  I do think you need to have a close talk with Chloe and your son about this situation.  Let her know that whatever she wants will be what you do . . . and you won't be hurt to have to step aside.

Then if she still insists that he walk her, he needs to stand firm.", "Perfection.", "This", "Honestly this is the common reaction to the situation.

She may be afraid of hurting him, or creating discomfort in a relationship that has clearly become extremely important to her. Personally, I hope that Chloe tells her bio-dad that he can either do what he's been invited to do, or he can miss out on the wedding entirely, but I can imagine that she might really, really want to be able to restore her relationship with her parents \u2013 some people just have a harder time giving up hopes like that \u2013 and I hope OP has made it clear that his love for her is not going to change, no matter what happens or what she decides to do. Frankly, he sounds like the sort of genuinely loving person who would do just that, but I obviously don't know.", "No, the best thing to do here is just to not say anything else to her parents, let's Chloe decide and don't engage. She asked OP to walk her down. If anything, it's more likely that she feels guilty and is being a \"bad daughter\" if she doesn't let him share in this milestone moment.\n\nI felt that way about my biological Dad too, like I had to tell him first about milestones because he wasn't around, and it wasn't until I was 27 hanging out with my wife and her family that they made me realize, I wasn't failing and being a bad son, but my dad had actually failed me and I took that into adulthood.\n\nOP needs to let it play out. Either Chloes parents will get onboard to support their daughter, or they will shoot themselves in the foot and destroy whatever relationship they have created this far", "Biodad cares more about his ego than his daughter. He is still a deadbeat", "Isn't that just infantilzing Chloe? \n\nShe wants both. \n\nIts her wedding and she gets to make that request. And she SEEMS willing to wait out biodad. \n\nSo how is OP the asshole by letting a grown woman make her own decisions about who will or will not be walking her down the aisle?", "Aww yes, let's take the choice away from her.\n\nThe biodad is choosing ego over his daughter.\nAt least op is honoring her wishes", "Why not esh? Shouldn't her parents also stay in their lane and not try to pressure or manipulate?", "They didnt make a \"mistske\" they made the choice every day for several years to cut out their child.", "Exactly.", "The biodad is still being a deadbeat by choosing ego over his daughter, AGAIN. It was called for.", "boo. takes an asshole to defend other assholes.", "I could see how OP's wife would feel conflicted about the \"standing up  for her\" part. On the one hand, Chloe is in a really stressful, heartbreaking situation. One could make a case that the kind thing to do for her would be to avoid a conflict that might affect her wedding, by any means necessary.\n\nOn the other hand \u2014 OP loves Chloe. Expressing anger at people who've hurt her so badly is not something one could call him an asshole for. And there are more important things than a stress-free wedding. If Chloe's biological parents are really determined to spend the rest of their lives avoiding accountability, pretending they never disowned their child and grandchild \u2014 I think it would really fuck someone up if they were expected to entertain that delusion at every family gathering. It means something to Chloe and to Brynn to see someone make another choice, motivated by love.", "Yes, this. She's already said she wants OP to walk her, but they do need that conversation. It's clear that her biodad is the wrench in the works, and while I like her optimism that he'll eventually come around... she also needs to consider how long it took him to come around last time he saw something coming that might affect his reputation.", "thanks for the correction", "[deleted]", "Common doesn't make it OK.  It may also be illegal.  Where I live, a parent is required to care for their child until 18.", "I don't disagree with the assessment, but I looked at it a \"Is this helpful, kind and true?\" It's only true.

She may not want to hurt op and might even feel embarrassed to admit that she still wants asshole dad there after everything so hasn\u2019t asked op to stand down. \n\nWorst case scenario would be that the asshole dad gets the hump and decides on the day of the wedding, he\u2019s not gonna turn up, rejecting her once more at another key moment of her life.

OP and wife, when push came to shove, super duper stepped up.", "Exactly, if they truly recognized their errors and wanted to make amends, they'd let Chloe have her relationship with them on her terms.

They're lucky Chloe is even giving them a second chance instead of telling them to sling their hook.\n\nInstead, they're trying to make demands of her and insist on everyone around them act like they never abandoned their pregnant 16yo daughter while OP and his wife helped her and their grandchild. They haven't been her parents in 9 years, but they want to pick up where they left off like nothing ever happened. It doesn't work that way.", "Their reputation is the crux of the issue.
