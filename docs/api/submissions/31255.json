We were reasonably concerned and upset, but supported the two in whatever they wanted to do. They decided they wanted to keep the baby.\n\nChloe\u2019s parents were not supportive at all and kicked her out of the house. We had her move in with us. My wife and I developed a close bond with her as we helped her prepare for the baby. After the birth of their daughter, \u201cBrynn\u201d, Chloe and Josh lived with us until they were 22. As they were so young, we really helped a lot those first few years as they got their GEDs, went to trade school, etc. It was not an easy road in the slightest, but it made us all closer. I consider Chloe the daughter I never had. They are now 25 and Brynn is 9.\n\nLast year, Chloe\u2019s parents got in contact with her and said that they were sorry, they wanted to be in their lives, etc. Josh and Chloe chose to hesitantly let them in their daughter\u2019s life. They have definitely played the part of overcompensating grandparents, who try to pretend no time has passed. Brynn is healthy, safe and loved, that\u2019s all that matters. They have been stand-offish with my wife and I. \n\nI feel they are jealous and maybe insecure when it comes to how close we are to Chloe and Brynn. We\u2019ve tried to arrange for times to talk, outings where all 4 of us can be with Brynn, etc, they always rebuff. So, we\u2019ve settled to be polite and kind, getting along with them for Brynn,Chloe and Josh\u2019s benefit. \n\nChloe and Josh have recently announced they\u2019re getting married. She asked me to walk her down the aisle. She explained that while her dad is too, she\u2019d love to have \u201cher other dad\u201d with her. I was touched. She has called me \u201cPapa Sam\u201d for awhile now (and my wife, \u201cMama Carol\u201d), but I still didn\u2019t expect this. I accepted.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s dad is refusing to walk her down the aisle because I will. He says that I am encroaching on a precious moment between him and his daughter. I said so long as Chloe wants me to walk her, I will. Chloe has said she doesn\u2019t want me to step down, but also wants her dad there. I\u2019ve said I\u2019ll support what she wants. She\u2019s remained firm that she wants to try to find a way to get her dad on board so we\u2019ll both walk her.\n\nChloe\u2019s mom said I should step down, because of course Chloe won\u2019t ask me to. I made a comment about how then I\u2019d be just as much of a deadbeat as they were for so long. This pissed her and her husband off.\n\nMy wife feels I\u2019ve fueled this drama and I should just step down so Chloe can have both her parents there.

In my opinion, she wants a stable and secure plan with a man she considers her second father (OP) and the best grandpa her kid could have, VS asking you to step down for Bio Dad's pride and now rely on someone she hasn't spoken to in 6 years for one of the most emotional days of her life.

That is them going around Chloe's back to get what they want.\n\nIf responding to Chloe's parents \"fuels this drama,\" according to your wife; then you no longer responding to them is you not fueling this drama. Chloe has asked you; you've agreed. The only thing more that you can/should do is let Chloe know you are honored she asked you and you love and support her unconditionally. (Notice that the wording does not hint that you are willing to step down; it only says that your love for her will not change.) That is the beginning and the end of your role.\n\nThe parents will either back down or they will push Chloe... to the point that either Dad chooses to not to walk (with you and) her down the aisle OR Chloe decides that (since her bio Dad won't accept and allow her what she wants), she is going to settle the matter with her second-preferred choice. That is when she will either (sadly) ask you to step down or she will tell her dad he is no longer going to be walking her down the aisle.\n\nSaying nothing and leaving it to Chloe does several great things:\n\n1. It recognizes that this is Chloe's decision from start to finish and allows her to be the adult that she is and make the decision she feels is best, given what she has to work with.\n2. It doesn't enable her parents to do an end-run around what Chloe wants. If I were Chloe, I would not want you (or them) to decide the matter for me.\n3. It forces them to either behave better or show their true hearts and souls. It also gives Chloe support and shows her your true heart and soul. Then Chloe can make her decision with that knowledge.\n4. It does NOT add fuel to the drama. Because you are neither taking the decision out of Chloe's hands, nor antagonizing her parents.\n5. I know that if Chloe ended up asking you to step down from that role, you would have compassion for her coming to that decision and your relationship with her would continue to be healthy and strong.
