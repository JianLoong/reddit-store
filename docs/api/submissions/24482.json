{"id": 24482, "submission_id": "15p872m", "title": "AITA for calling my sister's kid a spoiled entitled brat?", "selftext": "I'm a 34f and I have an older sister who is a 37f (Annie). She has 3 kids, Jacqueline (12f), Jasmine (10f), and Vincent (9m). Out of her three kids, she makes it incredibly obvious that Vincent is her favorite. She never ever punishes him and always lets him get his way and I'm assuming that is why he's so entitled. \n\nShe recently got divorced with her (now ex) husband and has been staying with me so I could help support her. I watch her kids for free while she's working and it hasn't been the easiest. I'm a stay at home mom with 2 kids (8f and 6f) so when she's at work, I'll be watching over 5 kids. Jacqueline has honestly been a big help though, she's well-mannered and always helps around the house.\n\nOn Wednesday, I was watching her kids while she was working. It was around lunch and I was going to make everyone peanut butter and jelly sandwiches when Jasmine came to me complaining about Vincent trying to rip up my daughter's Uno cards after a match. I followed Jasmine over to her room where Vincent was looking really angry and trying to tug some Uno cards out of my daughter's hands. \n\nI asked Vincent why he was doing this and he just burst into tears. My daughter explained to me that they were just playing a match and then Vincent ended up losing. I tried to explain to him that it was okay that he lost and he could play more rounds to get better. Vincent got really mad and stormed out of the room. \n\nWhile babysitting him, I've noticed that he can't stand losing, has anger issues (he tends to take it out on Jasmine), is extremely picky, and must get what he wants. I went to continue working on the sandwiches because I thought he should take some alone time to cool down (I later found out what he wanted me to do was yell at Jasmine and my daughter. Apparently that's what Annie does. Jacqueline told me this). \n\nWhen I finished making lunch, I called all the kids over to eat. When Vincent came over, I expected him to be happy about lunch because I had everyone vote for something and he voted for pb & j. Turns out, he was not happy. I had forgotten to cut the crust off. He started screaming at me that I should've cut the crust of the bread because I should know that he doesn't like it. \n\nI tried to stay calm, and told him that I would just cut it off. He said no and threw the plate with the sandwich on the wall. I was absolutely furious, and it looked like that 9 year old was equally furious as I was. I started yelling at him, but Jacqueline pulled him away to their room before things could escalate further. The other kids ate while I cleaned up the glass and food on the floor. \n\nWhen Annie got home, I told her I didn't want to babysit her kids anymore unless she started paying me. This was just one of the incidents and also the worst. Annie said no. This made me pretty mad and I told her her son was a spoiled entitled brat. Annie just went to her room and shut the door and hasn't spoken to me a lot since.

I think he\u2019s angry due to the divorce being so out of his control and trying to find something else to control like you and the sandwiches. He needs therapy to help regulate his emotions and deal with the fallout of a divorce. He\u2019s 9, angry, confused, frustrated and this is literally his entire world being turn upside down. I\u2019d have more kindness in your approach rather than writing him off as a spoilt kid.", "Yes yes yes absolutely YTA.", "YTA. A better conversation with your sister might have been \"Hey, Vincent seems to be struggling with the divorce and change in circumstances and is acting out while you're not here. I'm trying to take care of everyone, but Vincent's emotional well-being may require more resources than I am equipped with. Can you think about ways we can get him the help he clearly and demonstrably needs?\"", "Getting paid isn\u2019t the issue here. If they are going to live with you then Vincent needs to follow the house rules which are pretty simple: respect each other. You have to chat with your sister and point out that allowing Vincent to be the prince of the house is harming him and the other children. He is not only mean to the other children but it\u2019s clear he isn\u2019t happy either. It can\u2019t feel good to be this frustrated and mad all day. It\u2019s important for children to learn how to manage their big feelings and allowing him to get his way (I assume to avoid a fight) isn\u2019t helping him to be a kind, empathetic, happy, healthy well adjusted individual. \n\nYou don\u2019t want your kids to be subjected to this child or to pick up any of his entitled behavior. Sadly I think it\u2019s time for your sister to move. This is how she chooses to raise her kids and I\u2019m sure nothing you say will change her ways. It\u2019s a shame. She\u2019s doing a real disservice to all three of her children. Won\u2019t be surprised if the older 2 go no contact when they are older.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA.  Anyone else notice that he is the only male child.  Your sister is raising a little misogynist.  He expects to be treated like a little king because that is the way he is being raised.  This is definitely a case of my house, my rules.  You should not allow your nephew to get away with bad behavior.   Treat him like you treat the other kids, no better and no worse.  Expect him to respect you and your rules and your daughters and his sisters.  Don't let him get away with throwing tenper tantrums.  If he lived with me, he would have cleaned up the mess he made. If your sister doesn't like it, she can move out and take the awful little tyrant with her.  Sounds like his sisters would be happier staying with you.", "NTA. You would be if you'd said that (using that phrasing) to Vincent directly, but you didn't. You are helping your sister out in an enormous way. When you're both feeling calmer, lay out some clear boundaries for her regarding how Vincent is allowed to behave in your home. \"If you do not want Vincent to follow the rules in my household, you're going to need to find somewhere else to live and someone else to provide childcare. This is what I expect in my home. It is not negotiable.\"", "Your sister is facing the reality, that she raises a spoiled entitled brat son. NTA.

Time to start the eviction process. You nor your own kids deserve that in your home.", "NTA\n\nApart from the fact that she is staying in your house with her kids, eating your food, using your things and having you take care of her children, she has to teach her son manners. It will escalate and he will become a problem child. Your kids might even get hurt. The shards of that plate could have hit someone.\n\nI don't know what being mad at a 9 year old that can fully well know better is wrong for some people. But that was not acceptable. Or the fight. He can't cry and try to manipulate things on his favor. Nine is not two, he is old enough to know better.\n\nIf Annie can't parent her child, well she can do that under the bridge with him and you keep the nice ones until she gets her life together.", "Nta.

She better get her shit together.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nIt hasn't occurred to you that your nephew (not just \"your sister's kid\") is having behavioural issues because of his parents' recent divorce? You're an adult here, yelling at a kid under these circumstances makes you an asshole. \n\nFair enough to talk to your sister about the situation, she and her children should probably be in family therapy.", "NTA. Annie sounds entitled herself which is rubbing of on Vincent. \nI would tell her she needs to find somewhere else to stay before Vincents behavior starts to effect your girls.", "Tell her the girls can stay, and little Vince needs to go to daycare.

If that kid is going to act that way, I'd tell your sister she needs to leave. You're doing her a lot of favors in this situation. Her son is a spoiled, entitled brat, and she's very ungrateful.", "NTA \nTell her to get the fuck out.", "NTA but your discussion should have been about how unacceptable Vincent's behavior was, not an immediate demand for pay.

Will she react much the way Vincent does when he doesn't get what he wants, if you start setting strong boundaries? Will she cut you off, or threaten to never speak to you again if you don't do what she wants? Getting paid to deal with Vincent won't change his behavior.

The tell her she also needs to sign a liability waiver.", "Kids like Vincent usually learn pretty quickly that this type of behaviour isn\u2019t acceptable when clear boundaries are put in place, consequence of behaviour are stated and then carried through.  OP you\u2019re the adult here, and yelling at a 9 year old who\u2019s probably struggling emotionally due to his parents\u2019 divorce doesn\u2019t help.   This kid needs love, support and attention, not a screaming match.  When he yells at you about crusts, calmly give him the option of cutting it off himself or helping you do it.  Or better yet, get him to help you make lunch.  \n\nHe throws food against the wall?  Give him time to calm down, then ask him if he wants to clean it up himself, or he wants to help you do it.  He\u2019ll push back, but if you keep repeating choices calmly, he\u2019s going to pick helping you clean up, and while you\u2019re doing it, talk about other things he might have done rather than get mad and throw the food.  I guarantee if you spend some one on one time with this kid he\u2019ll start to open up to you, and will want to do things to gain positive attention from you.   Kids that act like this are a lot harder to interact with at first, but often it\u2019s their only way of getting the attention they crave (positive or negative), and they need more positive interactions to learn to regulate themselves emotionally.\n\nAnd work with your sister to try to use the same approach when interacting with him, and allow her to develop other ways to parent him effectively without giving into to his meltdowns.  And please also recognize that poor Jacqueline shouldn\u2019t be forced to be the peacekeeper for her brother and the adults around her.  If this is allowed to continue it will become a form of parentification (look it up if you don\u2019t know what it means), as this isn\u2019t fair to her.", "NTA. I\u2019d kick Annie and Vincent out tbh.", "NTA but you need to set some boundaries calmly with your sister about V's behaviour and combat it together. He is clearly not good at managing his behaviour and emotions and it's something all the kids can get involved in together. If your sister isn't willing to help address these issues then she needs to find alternative care for V such as a second babysitter that comes and manages him and her kids with you or some therapy for V. It's not healthy for anyone especially his older siblings and while he was way outta' line, they are probably still reeling from the divorce/new living situation etc.", "NTA.

Try talking to your sister when you\u2019re both calm.  Explain to her the situation and your feelings and if she seems like she doesn\u2019t care or want to help explain to her she\u2019s got to go for the safety and mental well-being of your children.
