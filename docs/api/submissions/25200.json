Old people get a pass for terminology, but not willful ignorance. Her use of Oriental probably is offensive, but if she takes correction on it I think it could be not a big deal. Taking her statement at face value, her assuming you only eat food that 'matches' you ethnicity is... stupid. Does her son think she's a stupid woman in other respects? No? Then why is she being stupid about this one particular thing, does he think?", "NTA, weird how the dementia took her manners only towards you. the bigger problem is that your boyfriend is not only comfortable with you being demeaned in your own home, he would prefer it to you setting any kind of boundaries or being treated with respect by his family. he's making it clear that you expecting to be treated with basic decency in your own home is an unacceptable ask, and that you're unreasonable and causing problems by wanting that. even if she were suffering from special racism alzheimers it would not be your responsibility to make yourself a small, easy target because it's easier for him not to bother caring about how you're treated.", "NTA. Sorry sweetheart, but you have a deal-breaker here. I firmly agree with earlier comments. You really need to find a new way for your life that doesn't include this man and especially his family. \n\nYou deserve better.", "NTA: My mom is 73, and she would never behave this way. In fact, she would have went off on boyfriends mother herself.", "NTA but the fact you're willing to put up with him defending her racism isn't going to end well.  Eventually it's going to be \"Your mother is a racist and so are you.  I have no interest in being around racists so have the life you deserve.\"  Remember if a known nazi sits down at the table with nine other people and no one leaves, there are 10 nazis at the table.", "NTA, and Steve needs to understand that his Mom, in her sixties, has been around long enough to get rid of her prejudices.  I'm in my sixties and I wouldn't dream of assuming that Asians only like \"Oriental food.\"  That's just stupid.  I like all kinds of ethnic foods, as do most people.\n\nYou need to have Steve tell his mother that she can't keep making these hurtful comments. Until that happens, she is NOT welcome in YOUR home.", ">And now my boyfriend wants to have a family get-together at our home. I have told him that he could invite his siblings, but not his mom because I feel uncomfortable around her, and would love to not have her negative energy around in my house anymore. \n\nWhat about being petty?

She can visit when he stomps out racist behavior.", "Nta. Your boyfriend is the problem. His mom was born in the 80s, not the 50s. We have to put our foot down to disrespect and honestly you should\u2019ve made a stink sooner. By him not telling her off he is condoning these racists comments towards you, and I wouldn\u2019t be together with someone that allows me to be insulted over something that I cannot change (my race/culture). You will always be second to mom and her opinions just know that. I guess the question is how much disrespect are you willing to tolerate? Because you also cannot just ban his mom from your shared home.", "NTA. If he loves you, he would see that what you mom is doing\u2026there\u2019s no excuse for. Either he put her in her place, or you may want to rethink the relationship", "My mother is in her 60's and growing with racist parents and having lived around white people most of her life, she sometimes says racist things.

Why does your boyfriend think it is ok to invite guests that the other person occupying the home is not wanting to invite?  Don't you get a say?  Since the boyfriend is supposed to care about you, why doesn't he set boundaries with his mother and shut down the blatantly racist comments?  \n\nWhen you think you're in lust/love, you may rationalize and put up with ridiculous behavior so step outside the love haze.   \n\nHIS MOM WILL NOT CHANGE, he will continue to tolerate her behavior since he isn't even acknowledging your feelings as valid over the past three years despite your conversations with him.  You're only 22, there are other boys to date and boys with moms  who are decent human beings.  \n\nLook for new accomodations and dump the boyfriend.

I\u2019m in my 60s and I\u2019m not a racist. You shouldn\u2019t have to listen to that filth. Especially on your own home.

It\u2019s never too late to set boundaries, especially in one\u2019s own home. \n\nIt\u2019s time for your boyfriend to step up and support you as a partner, or admit that his mother has the no 1 place in his life. At that point you need to make some choices. \n\nAlso, Wagyu and Hanwoo beef exist.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur partner is an AH for wanting you to just accept her racism.", "NTA. Good grief, her age is irrelevant,  except she is absolutely old enough to know she shouldn't act that way. Your BF needs to shut her down. Like, yesterday.\n\nBut hey, I'm petty. If he insists on the family meal, serve everyone else some delicious food from your culture and give her a plateful of saltines. ;-)", "You have a spineless mama's boy problem.", "Another 60 year old mother here. I am continually amazed at the incredible rudeness and lack of basic kindness some moms show to their sons (and daughters) partners! I do not understand the racist jabs and other cruel and hurtful comments. None of us should just excuse this behavior for age or ignorance or any reason. I've personally asked these types of commentors to please repeat that...I wasn't sure if I heard it right. Sometimes it does help the offender to see it wasn't right to say. Others...well they meant it exactly how it sounded and get defensive. I'm sorry you had to deal with this woman and her disrespect for you.", "Geeze I am in my 60\u2019s and that\u2019s not an excuse for racist behavior!  BF is a tool.  Him excusing that behavior due to her age is as bad as her actions\u2026maybe worse.", "Age excuses don't work anymore. And using the term Oriental? Ugh!!! NTA.
