That wasn't almost racist, it definitely was racist. Your bigger issue is your bf. He didn't even attempt to defend you and he makes excuses for her. He needs to get his shit straight or you should leave him in the dust. \n\nY'all have been together for 3 years. Do you plan on continuing. What about marriage, will she be racist to your family? What about if you guys have kids? They'll be biracial, do you want her to treat your kids that way? Will your SO continue to allow her to disrespect you that way? Will he allow her to treat his children like that while he continues to make excuses? \n\nThese are serious questions that need answered asap and honestly the boundaries should have been set ages ago and he should have stepped up the first time she said something disrespectful. \n\nDon't get trapped in a miserable relationship with someone who won't defend you and makes you deal.with their racist family. Look up the sunk cost fallacy.", "MIL sounds like the perfect christian", "60's is not that old and to use that as an excuse for her behavior is just stupid.

OP, why are you with someone who enables racism towards you?? This isn\u2019t ok. Take a step back and think. If you and him ever have kids, they too will be the target of those remarks.

He grew up with segregation, and told me about how there was a black boy when he was a kid who went to the school next to his, and their homes were in the same direction.
