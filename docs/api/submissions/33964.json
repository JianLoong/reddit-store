They got married when I was 14. \n\nMy dad's wife wanted me to divide Mother's Day between my sisters and maternal side with her. My sisters were not expected to do the same. But she would say she wanted to celebrate the day with her kid.\n\nShe signed us up for mother/daughter things. She would get hurt when I didn't want to go and would never ask my sister's. I asked her before why she expected me to do these things with her but she never invited my sisters. She said she was raising me and wanted to be a mother presence in my life but they were grown. I told her (and my dad on separate occasions) that I didn't want or need and wouldn't accept someone else into that kind of figure. I was ignored.\n\nI had a small run in with my sisters when dad was getting married because I said he shouldn't and they said he should be allowed to move on and mom would want him happy. When I explained what was going on they realized why I was feeling that way. They tried talking to dad but it did no good.\n\nMy dad's side of the family would all make comments that I was lucky to have another mother figure, or how I don't seem to give her the care and consideration she deserves. They would ask why I seemed to spend no time with her of my own free will. Or why I was never loving toward her.\n\nMy dad told me I should show her more love and affection and he told me I made her feel left out when I didn't tell her stuff or when I made plans with others but not her.\n\nI know some people would love to have someone like this in their lives.

It's very bizarre to me that for some reason your dad and step mother assumed that this would somehow be under some weird age threshold where you'd be accepting someone new in a \"mother\" slot without resistance. \n\nIt seems to me that stepmom wanted a kid, and that was part of her attraction to dad, and somehow it was presented to her that the older two were probably too old, but that OP was up for grabs? Very odd rational. \n\nIf she wants a relationship with you, she could have pursued one on your terms, in ways you were comfortable. She could have been an ADDITIONAL parental figure, rather than just trying to slot in and be a replacement mother. There's room in our hearts and minds for more than just two parents, as long as everyone is respectful of the roles that each guardian plays, but this is a thing that's earned over time and building a relationship, not something that should be thrust upon you because you're a minor and they're sleeping with your dad. \n\nGood luck op.", "NAH your father and stepmother are in the wrong, but it makes sense they had different plans with a 14 yo than a 19 and a 21 yo. It would have been better that you saw your stepmom as a parental figure, but they approached it the wrong way. They were pushy with the affection, what obviously made you uncomfortable, but they didn't punish you for not reciprocate it, so I don't think they are AH, just misguided", "NTA - your outburst was based upon years and years of them ignoring how YOU felt, and only caring how your step-mom felt.

Dad doesn\u2019t care how you\u2019re feeling, new wife obviously doesn\u2019t care or she wouldn\u2019t be pushing it down your throat.\n\nYour sisters obviously love and support you, they are the figures you need in your life, and sounds like they do a great job.

You were and are bonded to your own mother.\n\nYour father should have insisted she ease up,  He should have paid attention to what was going on with you but I guess he felt you had another mother to step in.  \n\nYour situation could have been handled by a therapist early on.  This is on your dad and partly on the step mom who should have been bright enough to see what was happening.\n\nI am sorry for you.  Your step mom should dry her tears, your dad should calm down, the relatives should butt out.  If there is ever going to be respect and friendship between, they will have to start listening to you and stop playing happy little family.", "NTA.  It's really wonderful that she wanted to step up and be a \"mother\" figure to you, and was happy to join your family and welcome you to hers!\n\nBut!  That role should expand to fill whatever spot is needed.  It could be big, it could be small, it could be more friendship than motherhood, it could be more guidance than friendship.  It could be anything.  The point is that it should fit where it's NEEDED.\n\nWhat her and your father did is force it into where it's not wanted or needed, thus probably preventing it from filling in where it could have been.  And it sent a message that your grief wasn't important and that you should just \"get over it\" when it came to losing a parent.  (Neither of them could identify with that by the way, losing a spouse is hard, but an 11 year old losing her mom is far worse in my view.)\n\nOn top of that, the weird mix of pushing you, but ignoring your sisters made it worse.  It showed you she was totally capable of providing a relationship where needed, and not overstepping where she's not needed.\n\nDid you blow up a bit too much?  Perhaps.  But so what?  This was years of pent up frustration where they didn't listen to you, so you had to do *something* to get them to listen to you for once.", "NTA.

I do believe this was all done in good faith, though.

Or when they don\u2019t allow the child and new spouse to develop whatever relationship comes naturally.  Also odd when the spouse pushes that role.  You don\u2019t need a mom, you had one and it\u2019s ok now that you just have a dad and his wife, who I\u2019m sure you would have had a great relationship with and chosen to spend time with if she just backed off.", "NTA. \n\nThe difference in expectations between you and your sisters is bizarre. I guess your dad saw them as \u201cgrown\u201d and you as \u201cstill needing a mom\u201d and built everything out of that paradigm. I can follow the logic, but it\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s bizarre that he would follow it so rigidly. \n\nIn a vacuum, what you said and did could be considered AH behavior. But in the context of the expectations they placed on you and the disparity between you and your sisters? You\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re not the one with the problem. Your dad created this problem and you just responded to it. \n\nEDIT: You tried to communicate that this isn\u2019t what you wanted and were ignored. And then they kept pushing. And then this happened. Because when someone tries to communicate calmly but continually goes unheard, they eventually blow up. \n\n(Edited due to misapprehension)", "NTA. My mom remarried when I was 9, and I very clearly remember my soon to be stepdad reassuring me that he didn\u2019t want to take my dad\u2019s place but would love to be someone I could depend on & trust. Shortly after I turned 21 (12 years of him in my life), I started to call him dad because he *was* a second dad. There was never any pressure to do it, even though he would proudly tell people he had 2 kids; I just realized he stepped into the role without any expectations. My actual dad remarried a few months before I got married. His wife & I both agree it\u2019s odd to consider her my stepmom because of when she came into my life.

The widowed parent should find happiness and love again.

Tell him that your boundaries considering your relationship with his wife needs to be respected.\n\nIf this discussion doesn't help, then there's no point in continuing to try, you're already 17, I'd start an escape plan to leave your father's home when you turn 18, you sisters and mom's side of the family will help you for that, they can house you for a time, help you find a college away and/or help pay for it, they can help organise the escape per say, it means you'll need to grow up and mature quickly because you won't be able to rely on your father for learning adult stuff but he'd shown time and time that even though he probably had (at least partially) your best interest in mind, he never listened what you had to say about what you needed and decided he knew better what you needed to grieve.\n\nAs I said, I'd give him one last chance to change his way of thinking by trying to explain to him as clearly as possible the damages his actions over the years have done to your relationship with him and to your relationship with his wife and how the difference of treatment between you and your sisters also affected your relationship with them, it might be enough for him to realise how he wronged you and try to make amends, but if it doesn't work, I would stop trying and plan leaving the house ...\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, I'm sorry for how your father tried to force you to grieve and I wish you luck and the very best for the rest of your life !", "Why do people try to shove this type of thing down your throat?

Your expected family contribution for undergraduate education will consider your Dad\u2019s resources; his wife\u2019s will be included if they file taxes jointly.\n\nSo if your expected family contribution is say $20k, and Dad refuses to pay, you\u2019re expected to come up with the $20k yourself with savings, private loans, etc. That only changes if you become officially independent from them (emancipated) based on the standards set for determining how much you can be expected to contribute. The Federal Department of Education (FAFSA form for Federal aid), the College Board (via its CSS form which some private institutions use), and individual universities will each have their own standards for distributing aid funds they control. Some schools just use the FAFSA to determine your need for need-based aid, while as noted above some private schools also use the deeper information from the CSS.\n\nHopefully your school or someone can refer you to a counselor for financial aid to strategize. Some people will decide to swallow the nonsense from your Dad and his wife until they get what they want; others will break away and forgo help from them.

The best they can hope for is something new and unique with you. There is no drop in drop out mother system like some video game. The biggest offender in this situation though is your father. How dare he force this upon you. Should he be allowed to move on? Yeah of course.

They need to treat you the same way as your sisters. Having said that, you're still young enough to need some parenting and believe me, parenting is a 2 person job.

She's likely cooking you dinner, contributing to the household, either financially or in other supportive roles or both. She's the woman your dad chose and it's true, your mom would have wanted him to be happy. That doesn't negate your feelings, but there is more than one dynamic at play.\n\nI suggest that you talk to your dad and his wife about family counseling so that you all can navigate family dynamics, expectations, and boundaries in a neutral environment.

To me that's the only way their mad reactions to this situation would make any sense?", "NTA - So many parents think they are doing the right thing by bringing in another parental figure, or the lacking mother/father figure, but they forget that to the kid, they already have a parent that made lasting memories. I swear, when people see this happening, they should hand some sort of paper to the couple getting married and remind them this. You are being forced to go along with an uncomfortable situation. One you have already explained to them and they ignored. The saddest part is, if they didn't force anything and she was just nice to you and your family, she likely would have been accepted as a part of the family. Maybe not the mom she wanted to be, but these people also need to realize it's not a reflection on them personally. If either of my parents died right now, I'd hope they both consider finding a companion when they are ready, but that person will never be anything more than their name to me. I hope they are a nice person and treat my parent well, and will always be welcome to come for family gatherings and stuff, but yeah, that's it. You're good, though expect things to be weird. Perhaps try to speak to her at some point and explain that you weren't lying when you said what you wanted, and explain to her how you can have the best relationship, like, be a friend or be supportive when things come up, if that's something you want. Otherwise, just avoid like the plague until you're on your own.", "NTA but learn to communicate better. They ignored your words and feelings for 3 years now and while your timing could have been better, that's on them for ignoring your feelings. Let her cry.

This is a classic case of why you don\u2019t push this relationship on a stepchild. It doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s also a classic case of your dad marrying to have someone raise you. I am sure he was lonely and picked someone he could love, but she was picked specifically to raise you. That\u2019s why they married so quickly after starting to date. My kids wouldn\u2019t have been introduced for 6 months if it was me. Adults their age don\u2019t usually marry so quickly because it\u2019s foolish. Sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this.

The ones that do is because they weren\u2019t pushed like you.", "See this? This is what 6 years of dismissing and disregarding your child's feelings does.

You were polite until she ignored your feelings.  She's been passive-aggressively pushing you into something you don't want.", "NTA. Omg, OP, I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019ve been going through. Someone should have stepped in & tried to help you get through to your Dad & his wife.\n\nWould you be open to going to a few sessions of family therapy with your Dad & stepmom? I think you would find it a relief, & a therapist could help them to see the situation through your eyes.\n\nI had a friend marry a man with 3 children, the youngest was 14 at the time. She was starting the exact same crap as your stepmom & Dad with the youngest son. In her defense, she truly cared about him, wanted to be there for him, wanted him to feel he had a mom. She didn\u2019t have kids of her own, & wanted to have a child to bond with, she had a lot of love to give.\n\nLuckily for her, she also had friends, a brother & a sister with children who kept her in line. We were vocal that she was going to push him away if she kept it up, she was trying to force a relationship on him that he never wanted or asked for. I can\u2019t tell you how many arguments she had with us, or how many times we all said to knock it off, simply be a friend to him. It was bad at times, she had some fantasy in mind, there were tears & upset, but we were all truly relentless. I have been friends with her since we were in high school, 30+ years at the time. The first time I ever yelled at her was when she signed up for a Mom & kid school function without telling him. That her not having kids wasn\u2019t this kid\u2019s fault, & just because his father fell in love with her & they wanted to build a life together, the kid shouldn\u2019t be expected to live in their bizarre fantasy world where his memories & past never existed. Were they trying to emotionally abuse him, or were they just selfish, inept, & clueless? I had the benefit of bringing up her life at the same age, & remind her of things. It took roughly 2 years to get to a good place for them. Fast forward 10 years, she has a great relationship with him. She is grateful that she had people who cared enough about her to call her out, & show her where she was going wrong.\n\nYou may want to share your post with your Dad & StepMom. I think your Dad was pushing you because he knew his wife was going to be sharing in raising you, the sacrifices she would have to make/accept. In his mind, you treating her as instant Mommy would be her reward for that. For marrying a man with children. That seems to be the same mindset your paternal family has. They see the situation as adults knowing how hard it was for her to have a new marriage that includes a teen kid. And that she was willing to try to be everything to you. They must have been somewhat relieved that this wasn\u2019t going to be a wicked stepmom situation, that she is a good person, with a good heart.\n\nUnfortunately, everyone saw you as a small child. But how they handled it would have been wrong, no matter what your age. The Christmas card & picture story tells it all. Honestly, the cards worry me. Look at the pictures. They\u2019re trying to split you into two, like your sisters are your half sisters. You have one foot in two different families, they don\u2019t accept that you don\u2019t. Instead of respecting & honoring your Mom, they\u2019re trying to erase her from your life, but it\u2019s ok for your sisters to remember her. This is insanity. You\u2019re the same age your sisters were when they married, why are they getting such different treatment? You are not the sacrificial lamb that everyone gets to gaslight while telling you that you should be grateful that stepmom cares about you. They\u2019ve, especially your Dad, created this mess. He refused to listen to you & your sisters, his decision was final. His youngest daughter was to play the role he assigned her to make his new wife happy. The hell with your mental health, that he was asking you to betray your Mom\u2019s memory. No one else, just you. Truly, this is bizarre.\n\nThe entire situation could have been handled better, if only they had listened. Stepmom could have been a good friend & support to you. You could have had a really warm relationship with her, you still may. I really hope you get professional help, OP. No one else has gotten through to them. Be prepared for the fallout if you do. If anyone can get your Dad & stepmom to see what they\u2019ve done, expect that they\u2019re going to be very upset once it hits them the expectations they forced on you. As angry as it makes me to read your story, I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone. I think they were living in their heads, not realizing how selfish & obtuse they were being.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so long, you reminded me so much of my friend\u2019s stepson, I wanted you to feel seen & understood. None of this is your fault, you acted maturely from the start trying to address it, asking your sisters to talk to your Dad. You actively tried to avoid the situation they\u2019re in now. Take care, OP, feel free to vent to me anytime.", "This is so sad.  I\u2019m sorry for you OP.

I think it\u2019s an important point to also kind of understand that they were also in a way trying to alienate you from your sisters as making you different than them. Since you already lost your mother, this probably also made you feel like you were losing part of a relationship with your sisters. They should\u2019ve treated your sisters the same as they treated you.  Also you cannot force relationships into existence they take nurturing and care on both sides.

I love that they respected the daughters enough to have a photo with Dad and no wife, but I\u2019d bet that was likely for the two sisters. It\u2019s weird that then they would want one with just you and not all three daughters. It would be fair to do the girls and Dad, then add in the wife and do all of you. It would be respectful for all involved. To single you out is just weird. \n\nThey are going to be mad for a while. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that. \n\nRepeat to them over time when they need a reminder: you don\u2019t want to be singled out and don\u2019t want to be treated differently than your sisters. You should be considered equal with your sisters and not part of a separate family. \n\nIt might take them a while, but help them understand it\u2019s wrong/weird to single you out when all three of you are full blooded sisters who all grew up in the same family. You shouldn\u2019t be treated as someone who is different from your sisters just because you are younger.\n\nIf your sisters are able to help you out, they should try to insert themselves in the mother daughter activities with you whenever one or both of them can so that there is a buffer and no one is singled out. That way you get some bonding time with them and can slowly grow a relationship with your step mom.\n\nMy advice for how to proceed to help you get through this: \n\n1) Talk to your sisters about helping be a buffer for mother daughter things so you are not alone.\n\n2) Apologize sincerely to your Step Mom and Dad for blowing up. And then have a conversation about how you\u2019ve been feeling. (You don\u2019t have to apologize for your feelings, just that you let them explode out. It will help them calm down some.)\nHow to apologize sincerely: \n1. Say \u201cI\u2019m sorry for\u2026\u201d explain exactly what you did wrong. This is for only what you did wrong\u2014this is not the time to give excuses or reasons for doing the wrong. This show that you understand what it was that you did wrong. \n2. Explain why what you did was wrong. \u201cIt was wrong because\u2026\u201d This shows that you understand how it affected the person. \n3. Say what you will do in the future to try to prevent it from happening again. \u201cIn the future, I will\u2026\u201d \nNever say \u201cI will not\u2026\u201d. You are telling what you WILL do when you are faced with the same scenario. It\u2019s too easy to say \u201cI will not _insert wrong done here_\u201d and then easily repeat that wrong again. Saying what you WILL DO helps you to actively analyze the situation and gives you a game plan to use in the future. This step shows to the wronged person that you have thought about how you got to the wrong and that you have a plan to help you to not do it again. \n4. (Optional depending on the circumstances) State how and when you will make restitutions. \u201cI will pay for the damages by\u2026\u201d This step is used when you damage something and need to pay for, fix, or buy a new one. Kids can offer to do certain chores to pay back, if needed. \n5. \u201cWill you forgive me?\u201d The last step is to ask for forgiveness. They do not have to give it to you. It is your responsibility to apologize, but they do not have a responsibility to forgive. You need to be prepared to accept their response; whatever it is. They do not have to forgive you. \nThe purpose of a sincere apology is to get you to actively think about what you did wrong, how it affected/effected the person wronged, what you will change in the future to prevent it from happening again, what you will do to repair the damage, and to show that you have thought about all of this to the wronged party. \nHere is an example of what you might say in your case: \u201cStep Mom and Dad (use whatever you call her here), I\u2019m sorry for blowing up and yelling when you wanted to take a picture of the three of us. It was wrong to yell like that. I was disrespectful in my tone and with how I said what I said. In the future I will take a few deep breaths and then try to calmly explain why what you have asked me to do has hurt my feelings and how I feel disrespected by it. I will also try to express my feelings more often when they are hurt rather than keep them bottled up so I don\u2019t explode like that again. Will you forgive me for blowing up at you?\u201d\nYou make it work for what you are comfortable saying/apologizing for. If you want to apologize for some specific phrases of what you said, if you feel bad about it, you can do that too. \n\nAfter you ask for forgiveness for yelling, then explain what I said above\u2014that you don\u2019t like being singled out when you and your sisters are equal family members and should be treated as such. It\u2019s disrespectful to them and you to treat you so differently than them. \n\nAlso explain that you are willing to put this behind you and would hope that they would be willing to do that too, but things do need to change going forward. If you feel up for trying, then explain that you would like to have a relationship with your step mom, but aren\u2019t sure what that looks like yet and would be willing to get to know her gradually and figure out what your relationship looks like over time. (Hopefully they haven\u2019t burned the bridge and you are willing to have some kind of a relationship with your step mom.) \n\nTell them that forcing a relationship too close, too fast is making you feel the opposite and you need some time with nothing forced on you to be able to cool down and feel like your feelings are respected. Then you can start to do things with your sisters and step mom or dad and step mom and gradually build the relationship from there. \n\nI suggest writing out what you want to say so you can make sure to get through everything you want to during the discussion. It will help you to be calm. You could ask your sisters for help to write it. I also recommend asking them to be there when you read it to your dad and step mom.\n\nI hope some of this helped and got you to think about things and what you want going forward. I really hope your adults listen to you and keep trying to do better. If your adults don\u2019t listen and disregard everything you say when you have this calm, open, honest conversation with them and continue in what they want while disrespecting your feelings, then you will likely need to keep your head down and plan for getting out like others have said. But, at least try a conversation first. \n\nWishing you the best outcome and that this is just a bump in the road of traveling life with family and not a fork.", "yes and once again, like any woman can be a mother.

In all likelihood the police will just want to know that you are alive and well and any legal exercise your dad threatens won\u2019t be heard before you are 18 if you are less than 3 months away.\n\nI would definitely strategize moving out when you turn 18 tho. I don\u2019t know if your dad is vindictive enough to withhold college money or anything thing to keep control over you. You\u2019ll have to figure that out and how important it is to you.", "Oh my adhd strikes again. Woof. Who just decides to play mommy to an unwilling teenager.

He's a bigot and I'm a lesbian. He came in hot like the king of the castle into OUR house when I was 18, and started saying phobic shit from day 1. I never had to live with him as I'd moved away to college the week before. It's been a long 18 years and things gradually changed. He eased up in a lot of ways. Even came to my gay wedding. When my son was born 8 years ago I drew a pretty solid boundary about respect. Whatever his issues are with gay people, he will never disrespect my family in front of my son or both him and my mom are dead to us. To his credit, he hasn't even come close to crossing it. And so, 8 years later, he is just as much my son's grandpa as my dad is. He's earned the title. As it should be.\n\nPeople are complicated. No one is all good and all bad. But when someone comes in and marries a parent, and forgets that children have their own needs and wants in relationships, they do everyone a disservice. My mom is firmly in the \"I serve my husband second to God and my children thrive under that\" so I was worried she would be pulled to his side. I think she's actually been backing me up 100% behind the scenes all these years. OPs dad is the one who failed here.

She likes you, and surely feels like a photo was a reasonable request. What she\u2019s neglecting to account for is the context of everything as a whole - what you\u2019ve been trying to tell her all this time.

Calling it mother daughter time won't make you magically her child.  \n\nIn time,  you may come to respect her contribution to your life.   Here again,  I've seen this.   My husband came into the picture when my daughter was 12. Though he legally adopted her,  he never pushed her to call him dad,  treat him as dad (other than the basic respect of a child in the home of their parents).  But he went to all the school meetings.   Went on outings.  Spent time,  cracked jokes,  comforted broken hearts,  sat by the hospital bed in his turns when she got sick. Helped pay for college,  advised her,  fixed her car.   In short,  he got busy parenting,  but never pushed the \"father daughter\" relationship.  She still uses his first name,  but calls him \"my dad\" when referring to him.  If she's well intentioned and a good parental figure (i.e., doing the parenting stuff without asking for the title), I suspect in time you'll accord her the title on your own.

Peoples feelings are hurt. \n\nIf you had a conversation, different time or place, or just refused to be in photo (without an Outburst) the ongoing situation (that you have to make clear) is about YOUR Feelings. By having an Outburst, the current situation (that is mighty clear to everyone) is about THEIR feelings (especially your Dad and Stepmom).
