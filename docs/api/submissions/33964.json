My sister's were expected to be civil but if they weren't close it was no big deal. But almost everyone (minus my sisters and minus my mom's family) expected me to see my dad's wife as some second mother or maternal/parental figure. They got married when I was 14. \n\nMy dad's wife wanted me to divide Mother's Day between my sisters and maternal side with her. My sisters were not expected to do the same. But she would say she wanted to celebrate the day with her kid.\n\nShe signed us up for mother/daughter things. She would get hurt when I didn't want to go and would never ask my sister's. I asked her before why she expected me to do these things with her but she never invited my sisters. She said she was raising me and wanted to be a mother presence in my life but they were grown. I told her (and my dad on separate occasions) that I didn't want or need and wouldn't accept someone else into that kind of figure. I was ignored.\n\nI had a small run in with my sisters when dad was getting married because I said he shouldn't and they said he should be allowed to move on and mom would want him happy. When I explained what was going on they realized why I was feeling that way. They tried talking to dad but it did no good.\n\nMy dad's side of the family would all make comments that I was lucky to have another mother figure, or how I don't seem to give her the care and consideration she deserves. They would ask why I seemed to spend no time with her of my own free will. Or why I was never loving toward her.\n\nMy dad told me I should show her more love and affection and he told me I made her feel left out when I didn't tell her stuff or when I made plans with others but not her.\n\nI know some people would love to have someone like this in their lives. But I want the same relationship my sisters have with her. But more is expected.\n\nSo Christmas Day came and everyone was at our house for Christmas (minus my mom's family). My dad and his wife gave me a card \"from my parents\" and my sisters got them with \"dad and his wife\". Then when it became time for family photos we got one with the three of us and dad but then my grandparents wanted me in the family one with my dad and his wife but my sisters weren't expected to be in it. I tried to step out and my dad's wife said it wasn't a family photo without their kid. \n\nThis was the point where I lost it and I told her I am not her kid, she is not my mother figure, that she is dad's wife just like she is to my sisters and I want it to be that way. I said I do not love her and hate how they all treat her like she suddenly became a parent to me.

It's very bizarre to me that for some reason your dad and step mother assumed that this would somehow be under some weird age threshold where you'd be accepting someone new in a \"mother\" slot without resistance. \n\nIt seems to me that stepmom wanted a kid, and that was part of her attraction to dad, and somehow it was presented to her that the older two were probably too old, but that OP was up for grabs? Very odd rational. \n\nIf she wants a relationship with you, she could have pursued one on your terms, in ways you were comfortable. She could have been an ADDITIONAL parental figure, rather than just trying to slot in and be a replacement mother. There's room in our hearts and minds for more than just two parents, as long as everyone is respectful of the roles that each guardian plays, but this is a thing that's earned over time and building a relationship, not something that should be thrust upon you because you're a minor and they're sleeping with your dad. \n\nGood luck op.", "NAH your father and stepmother are in the wrong, but it makes sense they had different plans with a 14 yo than a 19 and a 21 yo. It would have been better that you saw your stepmom as a parental figure, but they approached it the wrong way.

Them marrying a year later doesn't mean you automatically view her, or she becomes someone she's not. You have sisters and a maternal side of the family, too, so it's not like you are lacking female support, influence, or whatever a motherly figure is to you.\n\nThey most likely seized on you being 'their' child because your sisters were out of the house.

What seems really tough is how you and your sisters have been treated differently and how you\u2019re being pushed too hard to fall in line w the new family dynamic. You blew up. People do that.
