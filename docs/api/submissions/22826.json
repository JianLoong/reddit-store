{"id": 22826, "submission_id": "155pqgy", "title": "AITA for touching my gf?", "selftext": "I (24M) got into an argument with my girlfriend (26F) a little while ago. We've been in a long distance relationship for almost two years now. I live in France and she lives in the UK. We get to see each other in person every few months but have been looking for her to move to live with me.\n\nFor context, she's  had a difficult past. She has a long history of depression and PTSD,  which is all fine to me. Her work has been taking a lot out of her recently and she's been struggling mentally. Which is totally understandable and doesn't change how I feel about her. She's also part of the LGBTQ+ and uses she/they pronouns (says which one is fine, but prefers they/them pronouns). She's also in the autism/adhd spectrum or whatever it's called. But she's one of the sweetest people I know.\n\nAll of that is fine to me, I don't mind and I try to be there the best I can. But  what the issue is, is that she was here a few weeks back for little over a week as  it was all she could take off from work. But most of her trip, she was really tired and depressed. I know it's tough sometimes, but I'm bummed out that she couldn't cheer up for the duration of being here. Wouldn't just seeing me and spending time  with me be enough  to be happy? Also, I'm a bit upset over what happened on one of the last nights.\n\nShe was having a rough evening for some reason and kept spacing out on me and couldn't hold up a conversation.  I tried to hold her hand, to let her know that I'm there with her, but she kept pulling her hand  away quickly and said that she can't hold hands now. Okay, so no holding hands. I sat next to her at my desk and put a hand on her thigh, like I do all the time. But she pushed my hand away quickly and asked me to not touch her right now as \"sensory issues make it feel bad\". But I do it all the time, so I don't understand how all of the sudden it feels bad. I feel really hurt by that and don't know what to think. Does she not love me anymore? Why would my touch be repulsive all of the sudden? I don't get it. But I gave up and left her be. I  went to the gym and for a drink, to let her calm down. She later texted me to tell me that it's nothing personal, that her ptsd and sensory issues are just acting up that evening and can't handle touch, but she still likes to have me around and that she loves me. But I'm really upset over this because I feel like those are just excuses.\n\nI get it she has bad memories and dreams sometimes from her past, but it's not my fault and my intentions werent anything sexual in nature. Just wanted to feel close to her and I don't feel like she loves me anymore. And now she's back to UK and she's back to normal. She texts me a lot and stuff but it doesn't feel the same. I wish she would have put the same effort while she was here in person, but instead I feel like she was constantly too tired and sad to pay attention to me properly.\n\nSo AITA for touching her when she was having a hard time?", "created_utc": 1689950006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155pqgy/aita_for_touching_my_gf/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They ask not to be touched; you escalate the touching. Do you even like this person? Do you have any respect for their preferences?", "YTA\n\nWhere do I start with this post? You tell us that this person prefers to use the pronoun \"they\", but you use \"she\" to describe them throughout. And you claim to be in an intimate loving relationship with them? I don't get that at all. How can you claim to love a person, and in the next sentence say \"they prefer the pronoun \"they\", but I'm not doing that.\n\nIf you love someone, using whatever name or pronoun they prefer shouldn't be a difficult thing.\n\nNow the touch thing. They told you they didn't want to be touched right now. So no touch. That doesn't mean \"try touching something else\". It means \"my skin is crawling and I can't abide another human touching my body at the moment\". It doesn't mean \"I don't love you\".\n\nConsent isn't just about sex, dude. It's about everything. You agree, I'm sure, that she can love you, and also not be in the mood to have sex with you on a particular day, and that's OK. Non-sexual touch isn't different. She can also love you, but not want you touching her body at all today.", "Yes YTA.\n\n'I tried to hold her hand, to let her know that I'm there with her, but she kept pulling her hand away quickly and said that she can't hold hands now.

Try thinking about her instead of focusing on your own wants.", "Based on your post and your comment/edit, YTA. You were not trying to be there physically \"for her\", you were imposing yourself on her. She asked not to hold hands, so you escalated to touching her leg. You've said she has sensory difficulties, do you have a learning disorder?", "YTA. She wanted to not be touched at that moment and you took it all personally and made it about you. You need to back off when she asks you to and stop acting like you're the victim when she's upset.\n\nShe said not to do it. So don't do it. You're an asshole if you do after she says not to.

And that's WITHOUT touch-related trauma to make it even worse!\n\nBy insisting that they're \"excuses\" and touching her anyways, you are choosing to hurt them to satisfy your desire to touch them.

It feels like your comfort is more important than theirs.", "YTA\n\nAllow me to lightly explain a few things as best I can, as someone with some similar brain soup as your gf.\n\n1. One of the first things you say is your gf uses she/they pronouns, she is fine but prefers they, and then refer to them as she/her the entirety of your post. Not the end of the world, but interesting to notice. Maybe put more effort into mixing it up if they prefer the latter. Trust me, little things like that make a difference.\n\n2. You also said \"that's totally fine with me\" when mentioning your gf has ptsd, depression, sensory issues, asd and adhd. However, the rest of your words and your actions show that you lack an understanding of what those things really mean or how they manifest, which brings me to 3.\n\n3. It's truly *not* about you, honey. When they said it's not personal, they were being completely honest. Calling it an excuse is frankly disgusting and dismissive as hell, not to mention ableist. Please never say that to their face if you value your relationship. It will break their heart and trust in you.\n\nA few things to note about what they might have been experiencing (disclaimer, this is anecdotal from my own experiences and research and therapy and is not a blanket statement, just offering some insight for OP to learn):\n\nPTSD sometimes causes dissociation. It's possible that's what was happening and their sensory issues at the time were exacerbating it. They cannot help when these things strike, they just do, and if you want to be helpful, ask *them* what helps during these times and don't do what *you* think would help. Example, staying in the room so they know you're there with and can keep them grounded but not touching.\n\nSometimes, sensory issues caused by asd act up. Maybe it's being in a new place, the sheets felt weird, or their brain decided \"fuck you\". For example, touching certain Starbucks cups make me feel really gross and I have to wash the sensation off my fingers. I get irritable when I feel them (so I don't lol). Brains are weird.\n\nI don't know (and don't want to know) what their ptsd and depression are from, and maybe you don't know either, but trust them; it's not personal.\n\nYou're taking them trying to deal with a serious mental moment and making it about how it affects *you*, and that's the wrong approach.\n\nImagine if they were on fire, and you got upset because they were dealing with being on fire but *you* wanted to hold their hand. Do you think that's ridiculous? Well, their brain was on fire at that moment. It's no one's fault, and it's certainly nothing against you, OP.\n\nI highly recommend you do a bit of research on these topics so you can better understand. I don't think you mean to be an asshole, but if you don't do better for them, I don't see this relationship being successful. Also sorry this was so long I just had a lot to say lol \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude2d", "\nYTA for a multitude of reasons good lord.

Who cares what they present as? I am a military vet and I was trained to call people sir/ma\u2019am. My boss right now is nonbinary, so I sat down and ASKED them what they wanted to be called, as they are my boss.

Knowing all the things you do about your gf, you obviously haven't taken the time to understand what all those things combined mean. You definitely should have stayed close, but not touched her. Not touching her is what she needed at that time, and whether you like it, or not, her mental health doesn't hinge on her proximity to yourself. Especially considering her being on the spectrum. If you want to be with her, you gotta accept all that entails. My son is autistic, though definitely moreso on the spectrum than your gf, and you have to accept the boundaries when they put them up. I wouldn't carry this AH burden too heavily, but definitely learn from it if you want to continue the relationship. Best of luck.", "YTA but I\u2019m putting this lightly.

I have epilepsy and my husband gets it when I want to be left alone and he has problems with depression and adhd and other things not diagnosed.

I have to go to him and figure out when he actually wants me with him and when he doesn\u2019t. \n\nYou were hurt by what she did because you don\u2019t know and as hard as it is to understand something you have no idea about you have to try if you want you and her to work. Another thing to remember is she can\u2019t predict when she\u2019s going to have an episode, it\u2019s just like people can\u2019t predict when they are gonna get sick or when like me they have a seizure.", ">Wouldn't just seeing me and spending time with me be enough to be happy?\n\nNo, it's not. I think you don't understand. Having depression doesn't mean that you are sad and someone can make it better just buying you ice cream and being there. Depression is a disease. It can make you lose interest in doing activities, eating, seeing people, it can give you trouble sleeping and a number of other issues. According to some theories, depression could also be caused by the alteration of neurotransmitters like serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine, in that case it would represent a chemical imbalance in your brain and you need meds to fix that. Or to make it better. So no, being with you doing fun stuff is not enough, even if your being there and the knowledge that you wanted to spend time with her even if she couldn't give you her 100% probably made her feel less lonely. It's like taking someone with pneumonia to climb a mountain and complain that they are not having fun. \n\n>Does she not love me anymore? Why would my touch be repulsive all of the sudden? I don't get it.\n\nThat's clear. This is not about you. She was getting sensory issues. It means that what she sees, hears or feels (by touch) could be heightened or messed up in some way. Have you ever been in a room so loud that you had to get out? Have you ever been so hot in the summer that someone touching you would irk you and make you step back? Have you ever spent so much time in front of a screen that your eyes burnt and you had to take a time out? That's all annoying, isn't it? Think of your touch in that moment as someone hugging you during summer, without air conditioning, out in the sun with 30/40\u00b0C. The fact that she has PTSD also means that being touched sometimes brings back bad memories and she just can't handle being touch in that moment. \n\nYou need to figure out if you are ready and willing to have a relationship with a person that has her kind of issues. You wouldn't be an ass for stepping back because this is too much to handle for you, but it's not on her. If you decide to stay with her, then ask her more questions about her issues, if she's willing to teach you. Moreover read about them online (there are medical websites and stuff you can read). Try understanding completely. In your post you just listed a bunch of things, you can name her issues, fine, but you still react too emotionally, meaning that perhaps you haven't fully grasped what it really means.", "As a gf with depression, anxiety, and possibly adhd (planning to get tested soon), I know I can be a lot for my bf to handle at times. I also can be rude and snap when I get overwhelmed with my emotions, especially with sensory overload. It can be hard on him at times, and I sympathize with OP not understanding how to help/ if he can help. However, some of his language around their mental illness is horrible. OP should\u2019ve asked what he could have done for gf in the moment and respected their wishes; sometimes we all just need some space and time to breathe. When someone with on the spectrum shuts down, it can be hard for their loved ones, but that means you should have a conversation about why it hurt you and how you can communicate better (which it seems like gf is actively trying to do by asking bf to not touch them). \n\nFor the above reasons, I would\u2019ve given an soft YTA, but the whole thing with not respecting their pronouns makes it a hard YTA. If you can\u2019t respect your partner\u2019s pronouns, you def shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship.", "YTA- So people on the spectrum or really people with sensory issues in general can be severely affected by small touches like that. When the depression and dysthymia are set in, especially for a neurodivergent, it makes those other problems bubble to the surface. And no, just being around the person you love does not automatically cheer them up on the outside. That\u2019s part of the problem with clinical depression. Inside she could be much better, but you\u2019ve looked past that and have only seen that you\u2019re not getting the type of attention you want. It doesn\u2019t have to be sexual to bring up past trauma. Many times abusive situations start in a manner that seemed loving, which is why it\u2019s so hard for the person suffering, in this case, that\u2019s your girlfriend. You\u2019ve discounted her feelings and invalidated her trauma. What she probably needs is love and support, just across the room or other side of the couch. When she is ready for physical contact, she will probably let you know. It might be subtle and she may not say it so if you think she is hinting, ask her first. Neurodivergents are usually harder to read.", "Yes you are.", "YTA. If she was physically or sexually harmed in the past and she is dissociating (\u201cspacing out\u201d) then touching her may actively trigger her more. Your gf deserves better tbh..your interpretation of this is extremely selfish", "YTA read up and learn about autism and ADHD, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault she is having some stimulation and sensory issues. It happens. When she doesn\u2019t want to be touched DONT TOUCH HER. It\u2019s not your touch that is repulsive, it\u2019s just the stimulation of anything touching her. You really need to educate yourself, even if you and her aren\u2019t together, please seek education on these topics and work on your empathy", "YTA. Use they/them if they prefer that, and also take some time to talk with them about their experiences. You clearly seem to be uncaring about them.\n\nBonus YTA points for continuing to touch them when they clearly expressed they do not want to be touched.\n\nHere\u2019s a little exercise for you; instead of touching them, ask \u2018is there anything I can do to help?\u2019 This is far more comforting. And if she says \u2018nothing\u2019, accept that.", "Alright first of all if your partner prefers they/them pronouns, use those. Second, there doesn\u2019t need to be a reason for someone not to want to be touched. If they don\u2019t want to be touched, don\u2019t do it at all. On top of that your partner has legitimate sensory issues and ptsd so you should be treading more lightly regardless. Obviously YTA but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re more oblivious than insidious. Your desire for physical touch never outweighs someone\u2019s boundaries.", "YTA. it doesn\u2019t even sound like you respect your girlfriend at all. you said they mention using she/they pronouns but PREFER they/them and you spent your entire post using she/her for them.\n\non top of that, you spoke dismissively about her autism \n\n>She\u2019s also in the autism/adhd spectrum or whatever it\u2019s called \n\nleading me to believe you sort of don\u2019t take her diagnoses seriously.\n\nproven by how you acted around them when they were having a bad sensory day. you kept touching her after they expressed discomfort in it. and then you made their bad day about you in thinking \u201cthey don\u2019t love me anymore because she wouldn\u2019t allow me to push past her simple boundaries so i can touch them\u201d\n\ninstead of being supportive and asking your GF what you could do to help, you sulked around and made it about you. \n\n>i\u2019m really upset over this because i feel like those are just excuses \n\nher PTSD is an excuse??? oh buddy. i hope they dump you. YTA YTA", "I'm going to go with gentle YTA because you don't seem to know much about your GF's diagnosis. You can recite what she has but your post shows no real comprehension of what it means. She sounds like she's trying to explain and you're just acting emotionally about it. You seem like you genuinely care but you need to actually research and understand ADHD, autism, depression and PTSD.", "You were trying to be there for them and that's nice but intentions aren't as important as the impact they have. Sensory issues come and go so it's been fine before because it was but at that moment it was making things harder for them and not being helpful. YTA for taking this personally, making yourself the victim of her trauma, not doing enough to understand their neurodivergency after being together for 2 years, and basically throwing a tantrum when you didn't get your way. It just doesn't sound like you're ready to be in a relationship yet or at least not compatible with them.", "Before getting on the right medication I was like this. My senses overwhelmed me, I would get overstimulated and I would start having meltdowns where I was very angry from the constant irritation. In those times touching me would be very bad just adds to the overstimulation. It has nothing to do with not love/liking you and everything to do with needing time to decompress, have time away from the stimulation then be ready for touch again when calm. YTA not everything Is about you some people just need time away from touch for their own mental health.", "Info: It sounds like you are very accepting of her needs and her conditions.  But have you really taken the time to research not only the conditions she has (especially the neurodivergent ones) but also what it means to be a partner living with an ND person? Odds are her feelings for you haven't changed, but that it literally was too much to have anyone touching her.  It happens, it'll happen again.  So you need to be prepared, and learning why these things happen to her will help you both in the future.", "Soft YTA from me, because I don't think you're being malicious. \n\nIt's important to remember that people with mental health issues literally process the world differently than you. There's this thing called overstimulation, where someone is trying to process too much information and it's overwhelming. I often use this comparison: it's like if there's 20 TVs on at full volume and your brain doesn't have the ability to automatically sort out which one you're supposed to be watching. \n\nThings that set people off vary from individual to individual, but if your girlfriend says touch is one for her, you're doing the emotional equivalent of turning another TV on in a room full of 25 loud TVs. They most likely enjoy holding hands, they just need time to turn down the noise in her brain. \n\nTry asking your girlfriend what you can do to help them. Are there any date ideas that could help her turn the noise down in their brain? Maybe there's an activity that could distract them, like watching a movie or taking a nature walk.\n\nMost importantly, don't take lack of touch as a lack of love. Spending time with someone when you're mentally strained is a huge sign of trust. She's doing her best to be with you when she's at her worst because she loves you.", "YTA this is actually really sad just because they have never had a problem before with you touching them does not mean when they are oversimulated they have to accept your touch. As a person with touch sensitivity I completely understand where your partner is coming from. My boyfriend loves physical touch and it's way of comfort too. It was a learning experience for him to ask me first when I was upset if he could touch me. But if you love someone you should communicate with them on what they need for comfort", "Edit: Changing to YTA I missed a key point in your post, after the hand holding was a no-go you should *not* have gone any further, despite your intentions.\n\nI'm going to say N A H\n\nIt sounds to me like you had good intentions in your actions, but I will say for future reference that PTSD and sensory issues, especially when combined, can be *extremely* awful. They are *not* just excuses. I hope you haven't told them you think they are excuses. \n\nI understand your situation to some degree because I am personally a very touch-oriented person when it comes to love and affection. Much like you it seems, I have an inclination to hold a hand or rub a back or some sort of physical touch to show affection and care. My partner also has some issues with physical sensation. \n\nWhat I have learned is that it truly is not personal when they cannot be touched. I know it's difficult, but the best thing is not to touch them when they can't handle it. It doesn't mean they love you any less. \n\nI would recommend making sure they know that they aren't at fault for their sensory issues and PTSD, because it sounds like your partner has some feelings of guilt regarding these problems.\n\nAgain, you aren't an asshole, and you have good intentions. Just make sure you trust your partner and it should all work out.", "Slight yta but mostly nah. Sounds to me you need more from your relationship than she can give you.  She needs someone that completely understands her issues and respects them. It's not that shes not making an effort. Sometimes with her mental issues, she has to shut down as a defense mechanism to recover. It does not mean she loves you less.  Sometimes she's just overly simulated, a touch can make things worse. There's not much you can do to help her feel better, she's in her own world at that point. She has to get out on her own. It's one of the worst feelings of being helpless or useless as a partner. I understand this situation a bit because my wife has some similar issues. We've had few arguments because I was you who just couldn't understand and wanted more from her.  We were also in a long distance relationship. I decided to move to her state and move forward in our relationship. There will be at some point where she will see you as a safe place and she can rely on you if you truly accept her the way she is and understand her triggers and defuses. It takes a lot of work and a long time.  It's something you'll constantly have to make an effort to understand forever.

I (24M) got into an argument with my girlfriend (26F) a little while ago. We've been in a long distance relationship for almost two years now. I live in France and she lives in the UK. We get to see each other in person every few months but have been looking for her to move to live with me. \n\nFor context, she's  had a difficult past. She has a long history of depression and PTSD,  which is all fine to me. Her work has been taking a lot out of her recently and she's been struggling mentally. Which is totally understandable and doesn't change how I feel about her. She's also part of the LGBTQ+ and uses she/they pronouns (says which one is fine, but prefers they/them pronouns). She's also in the autism/adhd spectrum or whatever it's called. But she's one of the sweetest people I know. \n\nAll of that is fine to me, I don't mind and I try to be there the best I can. But  what the issue is, is that she was here a few weeks back for little over a week as  it was all she could take off from work. But most of her trip, she was really tired and depressed. I know it's tough sometimes, but I'm bummed out that she couldn't cheer up for the duration of being here. Wouldn't just seeing me and spending time  with me be enough  to be happy? Also, I'm a bit upset over what happened on one of the last nights. \n\nShe was having a rough evening for some reason and kept spacing out on me and couldn't hold up a conversation.  I tried to hold her hand, to let her know that I'm there with her, but she kept pulling her hand  away quickly and said that she can't hold hands now. Okay, so no holding hands. I sat next to her at my desk and put a hand on her thigh, like I do all the time. But she pushed my hand away quickly and asked me to not touch her right now as \"sensory issues make it feel bad\". But I do it all the time, so I don't understand how all of the sudden it feels bad. I feel really hurt by that and don't know what to think. Does she not love me anymore? Why would my touch be repulsive all of the sudden? I don't get it. But I gave up and left her be. I  went to the gym and for a drink, to let her calm down. She later texted me to tell me that it's nothing personal, that her ptsd and sensory issues are just acting up that evening and can't handle touch, but she still likes to have me around and that she loves me. But I'm really upset over this because I feel like those are just excuses. \n\nI get it she has bad memories and dreams sometimes from her past, but it's not my fault and my intentions werent anything sexual in nature. Just wanted to feel close to her and I don't feel like she loves me anymore. And now she's back to UK and she's back to normal. She texts me a lot and stuff but it doesn't feel the same. I wish she would have put the same effort while she was here. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You know they aren't neurotypical, though i guess not how, but autism in particular can cause sensory issues. You maybe...should know that? Read the wikipedia page about what your partner is going thru?\n\nThis might not be the most amazing example but think of holding hands like something like chocolate cake. Now chocolate cake sounds like it should be good all the time but I can think of a lot of reasons why I wouldn't want a cake, even though I really like cake -- my stomach might hurt, it might be too early in the morning, i'm not hungry, I've already eaten, etc. That doesn't mean I suddenly hate chocolate cake. Just that I can't handle it right now.\n\n\"It's not my fault\" Yeah she's not blaming you, so why do you need to assert that? If you can't handle dating someone who is coping with mental illness that's fine, but don't act like she's having a mental illness deliberately to upset you. You say work has been a grind, they've been exhausted -- maybe they just needed a vacation where they slept and hung out at home, but instead they powered thru and visited you.

Wouldn't just seeing me and spending time with me be enough to be happy?\n\nThis isn't how depression works at all. It's not a switch that she can flip off while she is around you. Despite what you think of yourself, you are not a cure for depression. Thinking that she should be happy because you are around is an indication that you have no real understanding of depression and its impact on a person.\n\n>I tried to hold her hand, to let her know that I'm there with her, but she kept pulling her hand away quickly and said that she can't hold hands now.

But she pushed my hand away quickly and asked me to not touch her right now as \"sensory issues make it feel bad\". But I do it all the time, so I don't understand how all of the sudden it feels bad.\n\nAgain, you do not understand depression and potentially how her autism may factor into things. She told you she didn't want to be touched. She gave you a reason why. It doesn't matter if at other moments she is fine with the touch, in that moment, she wasn't. \n\n>I feel really hurt by that and don't know what to think. Does she not love me anymore? Why would my touch be repulsive all of the sudden?\n\nYou are making this about you when it isn't. Why are you jumping to conclusions about her not loving you? Why are you relating not wanting to be touched at a specific time to her being \"repulsed\" by you?\n\nAgain, you do not understand depression or, potentially, her autism.\n\n>She later texted me to tell me that it's nothing personal, that her ptsd and sensory issues are just acting up that evening and can't handle touch, but she still likes to have me around and that she loves me. But I'm really upset over this because I feel like those are just excuses.\n\nThey are not excuses. She is telling you exactly how she reacts and what her boundaries are in the moment.

For me, it\u2019s always worse when I\u2019m under stress and/or my PTSD has been activated in some way. When I\u2019m in sensory overload, even the things I usually like affect me in ways they normally don\u2019t. My favorite foods don\u2019t taste right. The volume where I usually play music is too loud and it hurts. My normal lighting setup is too bright and it also hurts. My skin becomes intensely sensitive. It\u2019s too tight and itchy, and my favorite clothes feel heavy and scratchy and wrong, and even touching the people I love doesn\u2019t feel the same as it does when I\u2019m not overloaded.

It\u2019s an indicator that they are under a lot of stress right now, and this is the way their body responds to that stress. \n\nOP, if you intend to stay in this relationship, you need to start learning and understanding neurodivergence and LGBTQ identities. How can you claim to love your partner and not try to understand them?", "This right here. \n\nOP, YTA. \n\nYou seem to be far more concerned about how your gf makes you feel rather than what they need as a person. Them not being automatically happy to see you probably has a lot more to do with whatever is going on with them than you. \n\nFor context, I'm autistic and my sensory experiences are often vastly different from allistic folks. Studies have suggested that autistic brains produce 42% more information than allistic brains. Plus we often experience things in more acute detail that can be really overwhelming and even literally painful.\n\nIt's possible that your gf was dealing with being hyper aware of all the different sounds of your place, the lack of safe foods, the different taste of water, the different temperature and humidity, etc and struggling to adjust to all the minute changes that you don't even notice. When I experience overwhelm like this it *literally* hurts, like my brain perceives overwhelm *as pain*. It's also possible that they were not at all concerned by any of that (because all autistic people experience the world differently), though based on their concerns about touch I'm inclined to say that they were probably overwhelmed. Oh, and none of this is consistent - tolerance and comfort can vary widely depending on any number of things and the person often can't control it. \n\nI'll also add that it is possible your gf was stressed out from your lack of understanding. Did you check with them about how to make them more comfortable? Because it sounds like all you did was shame them for experiencing the world the way they experience it and get mad at them for not pretending they were fine. Your comment about them not being happy just because they were with you is especially egregious here - it sounds like you want them to mask so you can feel more emotionally comfortable as opposed to addressing the things that are hurting your gf.\n\nFor the record, I get wanting people to behave a certain way, but demanding behaviour from someone with ASD can be really harmful long-term. Some studies have suggested that the average lifespan of autistic women (I'm unaware of studies that address gender non-conforning folks) is 36. I've also seen studies that suggest 39, 54, or 16 years younger than the general population (there really isn't a consensus beyond the fact that we tend to die younger). Many have pointed to the stress from masking being a key contributor to this as it leads to burnout, depression, loss of skills, and potentially suicidal ideation. One recent study suggests that 1/5  women with ASD and ADHD have attempted suicide. Like, this is statistically notable. \n\nWanting to spend time with your gf and be happy totally makes sense. Being disappointed that didn't happen makes sense. Getting mad at your gf for being who they are doesn't. Even beyond that though, you crossed a boundary that they had established by continuing to touch them. Given that you also consistently use \"she/her\" despite saying that they prefer using \"they/them\" I worry that you don't respect their comfort at all.", "But aren't they to a certain degree excuses? What happened to her happened a long  time go and I don't have anything to do with it.

Sometimes I\u2019ll only hold it for a few minutes, but that\u2019s a compromise I\u2019ll make for my kids.  But I make that compromise, no one makes that compromise for me. \n\nMy SIL has PTSD and was not from lovingly expressive family.  We are words and hugs and all those things.

I won\u2019t initiate any touch her anymore unless she asks or initiates it herself. It\u2019s odd for me, but it\u2019s how I can respect her. \n\nAnd depression. The things that can usually make you super happy don\u2019t. \n\nAll these things there is no off switch. You can\u2019t control them.  But they can and do snowball into really bad moments or days.

It is NOT an excuse, it is 100% real and outside of their control once it starts.\n\nHere's how PTSD works - their brain *literally* behaves in a way they can't control sometimes.
