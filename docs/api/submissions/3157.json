Only got to do it after we agreed to split the money 50/50 too.", "Aren\u2019t you super embarrassed to ask a literal child to financially support your adult ass?", "That's not something to really laugh about, dude. You admit your nephew is barely an afterthought, while also asking him for $200. \n\nYou need to move on from this situation and get your life together. Coming to this sub reddit, asking about your moral compass, while asking for financial support from a 10 yr old, should be giving you some kind of sign to be better.", "Yea well it ended up being an awesome present cause now this kid can get four big lego sets", "Dont you feel, i dunno... kinda embarrassed by the way youre acting?", "If I could up vote this 1000 times I would lol but true!!!", "I actually had to Google this because I didn't understand, apparently this means the kid is his friends son\n\nIt's the term used for a close friends kid", "I'm guessing \"nephew who is my brother's kid\" (vs., what? A \"sisphew\"?) but honestly, yeah, I'm giving it a hard YTA regardless of what it means.", "This is the kind of gift my children\u2019s great aunt gives them *along with candy and other things* at Easter. This is a fun gift when they also receive something *tangible*.", "i'm not surprised. You are probably the kind of man that cheers when a boy gets raped by a female teacher. You are disgusting, please never reproduce.", "In my partner\u2019s family it is a common Easter gift for the older kids. And they *always* get to keep their winnings.", "Honestly i would bet money if his brother wasn\u2019t there to stop him he probably would have snatched the ticket out of his nephews hands.", "This.\n\nEdited for typo because I can't spell this correctly.", "BOOM \ud83d\udca5", "My brothers kid", "Gos I can\u2019t upvote this enough.", "We've always done stocking scratchers at Christmas, usually about $20's worth, like a $10 and 5 $2. The kids love it. Most of the time, they win like $4, but every once in a while, they'll win like $100. \n\nMy son still talks about a 3 years ago, when everyone but him had won money, which made him sad, so his grandfather said, \"I'll match whatever you win on that last one,\" and he won $100. He was 7 at the time.", "My uncle, lol. The cousins all got 2 or 3 scratch cards for Christmas. He also claimed that we'd split any winnings every time. I always assumed he was joking about it...", "I\u2019ve done it many times. But I\u2019ve never asked for, or expected, a cut.", "My white trash relatives.  What else can you get when you stop on the way for smokes?", "I'm surprised an anemone can even claim winnings at all.", "Here too I think. Luckily his dad can cash it for him. I wouldn't trust uncle with a stick of gum at this point", "They can\u2019t in the states either but the brother will have to claim the $400 and give it to his son.", "Oh yeah for sure. I actually read this post to my husband and in laws and everyone agreed major YTA. We all agreed there\u2019d be major beef if one of the adults tried to pull that!", "True. I can see that happening. He\u2019ll probably remind his nephew years from now how he helped him and deserves to be paid back", "Yeah. That\u2019s a nephew.", "That\u2026is just a nephew, my dude.", "Yes, but that's a stocking stuffer. Not their only gift from you. If they win nothing, it's not a huge deal.", "My family did this too!", "An anemone must be accompanied by an adult marine biologist to claim winnings. Everyone knows this.", "\u201cRemember how I generously let you keep all the money from that lottery ticket? You owe me so give me 10 grand now which is the interest from what you owe me\u201d", "True."]}
