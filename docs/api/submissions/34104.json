Why is the possibility of your kid having ADHD so offensive to you?\n\nYour response as a parent should be one of concern, and getting them access to any diagnosis and/or supports they may need, not way over the top defensiveness. \n\nYour MIL's overstepping here is pretty shitty too (and the trance thing is utter bs), but not nearly as abhorrent as the gross ableism you've displayed. \n\nYes, your kid might have ADHD. *Any* kid might have ADHD. This is not an outrageous statement, nor should it cause anger, or offense. \n\nAt this point, an apology to, and conversation with, your MIL would be appropriate. Find some neurodiverse (or at least neurodiverse-affirming) sources to learn about ADHD, and discuss her concerns with an open mind. Then maybe (*hopefully*, given some of the stories we see here) she won't feel the need to overstep like this again - assuming it comes from a place of genuine concern on her part. \n\nIf it is not genuine concern from her, and the overstepping is continuing, then that is an entirely different issue to be addressed - but one that should absolutely not take precedence over concern and support for your child.", "Autistic person here! Why on earth would you be appalled by this?\n\nESH.", "NTA", "YTA. She has a genuine concern for him and you\u2019re calling it an accusation. We had a teacher suggest our kid be evaluated. We said, \u201cthank you for your concern.\u201d and went on our merry way (kid has had other teachers with zero concerns they have ADHD and was seeing other specialists for other reasons who also had zero concerns when asked). \n\nHer bringing pictures over to test your child or experiment on him is unacceptable too. \n\nif your child has ADHD, it\u2019s just something to know to help inform how you help them succeed (be it therapy, special tutoring, or medication). It is not a moral failing or judgement on your parenting.", "ESH. MIL is wrong for the trance picture nonsense. You are wrong for treating her original concern about ADHD as an \u201caccusation.\u201c", "NTA because even IF your son has ADHD, your MIL's actions were inexcusable. That said, please consider discussing the possible symptoms with his pediatrician just in case. ADHD isn't a shameful thing and can be ameliorated especially early.\n\nWhen I was 15 yo, I told my parents my sister (3 yo) had lazy eyes at times. They ignored me until 6 mons later dad saw it happen. She got surgery & glasses, and by 10 had perfect vision - she would have lost substantial vision otherwise. My cousin lost vision in one eye because his parents denied he had a lazy eye intermittently.\n\nSo checking can't hurt. But don't allow MIL around your son without you or your husband (if he agrees with your evicting her).", "NTA - Your MIL is not a certified doctor is she?  If not, then she can just shut her pie hole and that goes for the rest of that side of the family.  You owe her nothing but to call her out for what she is...a quack.", " She was wrong for the pictures. You are wrong for your attitude about it .  \n\nTake your child for tests to either prove her wrong and you feel better, or to give you all coping mechanisms if she is right   \n\nIt's nothing to be ashamed about. I wish this diagnosis was around in the late 60s and 70s  would have saved a lot of kids a lot of issues.", "Info:  why would you be appalled if your son had ADHD?", "Wtf is a picture that puts people with adhd into a trance?!?\ud83d\ude02", "Please explain to me how ADHD is an \u201caccusation\u201d\n- explain the insult to me\u2026 an adult ADHDer. \n\nGo ahead.

Throwing her out of your home because she said he might be neurodivergent is such a wild overreaction on your part it really concerns me about how you\u2019d react should he actually be so. I think some resistance is normal when someone suggests something like this, but this reaction was just so OTT it puts it into a different level.", "??

Only people with ADHD understand that joke. Maybe OPs son would.", "I'd ask her about it.  You might be blind to it, you also might be right.  I'd ask her what she is seeing.", "You are misinformed about ADHD. It presents in a number of different ways. You could have at least heard your MIL out. YTA.", "I have 3 kids who were all extremely well behaved in school, at friends\u2019 homes, and at home.  All with ADHD.  Good parenting works.  However, it doesn\u2019t make them not have adhd.  \n\nA kid who is about to bounce off the walls while waiting at a restaurant, you take outside, just in time, and have them do jumping jacks.  Then go back in and play counting games.  Give them brain teasers to solve.  Work out patterns in the tiles.  Ordinary stuff that good parents do keeps kids with adhd happy, productive is and well behaved.  \n\nIn the car, on road trips, you read to them. Sing songs that have seated movement exercises. Have them knit.  Yep, we kept the kids happy on our many road trips (we traveled a lot) without tablets, or video.  \n\nOne of my kids was dx\u2019d quite old and I feel badly about that.  Their life would have been easier had the \u201clight dawned on marble head\u201d (me) earlier.  \n\nIf anyone suggests that the kid has symptoms, evaluate them critically, carefully, and with an open mind.  Poor behavior isn\u2019t a reliable symptom.", "Fwiw, adhd does not require \u201cbehavior problems\u201d. Particularly if it\u2019s associated with anxiety or worry about punishments.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your son is one way or another, but you have clearly stated a bias that suggests you are not an objective observer at this time.", "With respect, I didn't have the \"classic\" behavioral issues that people tend to attribute with ADHD, but I still very much have ADHD. I didn't get diagnosed until I was 26, and I constantly struggle with the question of what could have been. \n\nAssuming you're a competent parent, you take your kid to the doctor on a somewhat regular basis for check ups, so it doesn't hurt to bring it up then. Say, \"Hey, MIL thinks he's showing signs of ADHD, I disagree, what do you think?\"\n\nThe trance thing is 100% BS though.", "That part of it is bukkshit", "My poor mother was so upset that she may have done badly by me by not recognising that I had ADHD before my diagnosis as an adult... like mum, I was a female born in the 80s, it is a societal fault not YOURS. (But she was a very caring mother, is my point).", "Or parents of kids with it!  The other kids on a trip with one of mine got my kid that tshirt!   She wore it proudly!!!", "Thank you for the advice!", "One of my kids wasn\u2019t dx\u2019d until middle school when I made a comment about them being like their dad\u2026who has add\u2026I felt so badly, not seeing and getting the treatment earlier.  We already had one kid dx\u2019d!!!", "Replying to myself here to say: OP I did not mean to imply you are not a caring mother (even if it could read that way). Honestly, you may have been influenced by one of the issues in the ADHD name - hyper. Behavioural issues is often linked to the idea of hyper lil boys running around, and thus the 'plague' of women being diagnosed now in our 30s, and FINALLY understanding why we are different. \n\nI recommend learning more (I recommend articles on ADDITUDEMAG) about all facets of ADHD, so that if needed you can be the advocate your son needs, and bonus - debunk any ridiculous pseudo-science from your MIL)."]}
