You and your father seem to be the responsible adults, I suggest looking into resources to help her overcome what sounds like a gambling addiction.

I can see the medical (brain) side of it but she needs to sort herself out or she is going to lose everything.\n\nYour issue is what happens when you move out.  You are not obligated to your brother, sister or father and definitely not your mother.\n\nI'm guessing you don't want to find your siblings and your dad homeless.  I nearly think your dad is better off divorcing your mother so that he is no longer financially tied to your mother.  Would he get any welfare for his disability?  How old are your siblings now?  Is your sister working now?  What about your brother?  How severe is his ASD?  How old is he?  Can he do some sort of work?  Even from home with your dad's support.\n\nOnce your income is gone from the household, will your mother still pay the bills or will they end up evicted.", "NTA\n\nYou are not an arsehole for saying you will no longer underwrite her gambling addiction. That is perfectly appropriate.\n\nI was about to write that you could, nonetheless, have delivered the message matter of factly, stating exactly what I said above. I was about to write that there was no need to personalise by saying \"I am no longer your son\" -- addiction is, after all, a disease, not a moral failing. ANd you are delivering that message because you care about her and the rest of your family.\n\nBut in your text, I don't see that you actually said \"I am not longer your son\". You said \"I am turning my back on you\", which is not quite the same thing. You further state that you \"took action to threaten our mother-son relationship\". Does that mean you formally sought emancipation as an adult?\n\nIt doesn't sound like you did any of this. Instead, you said you would not have a relationship with her until she gets her gambling under control. I applaud this.", "NTA, but you will probably have to move out. Gambling is an addiction, and like other addictions, is difficult to kick. There is Gamblers Anonymous, similar to AA but for gamblers, but I don't know how good it is or whether there is a group in your area, but if there is, point your mother to it.", "As I had identity theft done against me by my mom, NTA\n\nBut, as others said, you need to be hardcore with this. No empty threats, you leave, stay gone.\n\nSomethings to protect yourself. Make sure you do a credit check on yourself. My mom did a signature loan in my name and I had no idea until a FBI agent came to my government job asking me why I'm not paying my loans.", "Info: why do you think your stern comment is going to change something your father hasn\u2019t been able to address over years? You aren\u2019t the asshole for establishing a boundary but it is a bit immature to think your mother will change her behavior. The ultimatum was pointless as most are.", "NTA", "NTA but you need to move out NOW. You need to make it clear to your siblings they should not give their mother money, and if you don't follow up a warning speech with action, the message won't sink in.\n\nYour mom will NEVER stop. Gambling is am addiction, and addicts can use anybody and tell any lie with an audacity that decent people can't believe humans are capable of. No tactic is too low or mean for them. Yes, I know from personal experience. There was no manipulative tactic my mom was above doing to get money out of her kids, from outright lies to CONSTANT harping on how \"God loves a cheerful giver.\" Just typing that made my stomach turn.\n\nDon't make the same mistakes I made. Cut off your funding NOW and do your best to instill on your siblings that they should never be guilted into supporting her.", "NTA\n\nShe needs a wake up call to see what harm she's doing to everyone, not just herself. Just be sure to follow through. Its not fair on your sibs, but something has to change, either warning letters gets sent or other things happen. I'm sorry that you're going through this", "NTA. Your mom is an addict, plain and simple. Deep down she knows what she's doing is wrong, but she lies to herself and everyone else to justify her actions. This is a compulsion for her and she needs rehab or she will continue to gamble away until your family is homeless. \n\nDo not give her any money. Have a talk with your siblings, heck see if you can set them up bank accounts for their money so it won't be in the house for her to steal or try to guilt them into giving to her. See if you and your dad can set up an account that she doesn't have access to that all the household money goes into. Then try to set up bills so that it's online or automatically drafted from that account so that there's no money loose in the house for her to gain access to. \n\nNormally I'm against cutting off someone financially like that, but I grew up with a gambling addict and they will spend every dime they have on their dopamine rush instead of bills or groceries. So you can't trust them to be responsible.\n\n If she works that's her money. Make it clear she still has responsibilities, but you and your dad need to proceed as if it's only you two with any income and take whatever steps necessary to protect yourselves and your siblings. I'd get valuables like jewelry, watches, etc out of the house into a safe deposit box because as soon as she realizes she is cut off, she will escalate and start trying to steal stuff to get money to feed her addiction.\n\nIf she needs money for specific things like a doctor's appointment or gas, you can go with her and pay or there are specific cards you can use. Like some gas stations have gift cards/prepay cards. Check your health insurance because some offer a medical pay card that you load with money and it's only able to be used for medical bills. My husband's employer has this so we can add a little each month and use it when necessary.  It's called an HSA account. Here's a [link](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-savings-account-hsa/#:~:text=A%20type%20of%20savings%20account,your%20overall%20health%20care%20costs.) with information about it. You may be able to get an HSA on your own too so check with your bank or credit union.\n\nHonestly the best course of action would be to document everything to prove she's a gambling addict and then for your dad to divorce her using that evidence. Your dad would be able to get more assistance without her there and your family would do better financially and mentally without her. It sucks and you feel guilty because she's your mom, but she's an addict and her addiction is a danger to the household. It's best for everyone if she's out of the house.", "My mom is a gambling addict too. It sucks being the kid of an addict. Sure, it motivated me to become a psychologist, but my childhood was trash a lot of the time. So I completely understand the urge to cut contact, and no, you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for doing so.  But I want you to have realistic expectations for what will happen. \n\nFirst, your mom will not change because you cut contact. She has deep-rooted psychological pain that she\u2019s coping with by gambling - some people drink, others cut themselves, our moms gamble. And until she accepts that she needs help and goes to therapy (to learn more adaptive coping mechanisms), she won\u2019t change. And you can\u2019t make her change - so try not to waste your time or energy convincing her to. \n\nSecond, she will demonize you and make you out to be the bad guy. Addicts are experts at this. They\u2019re often spinning the narrative so that they\u2019re the misunderstood victim and everyone else is the uncompassionate asshole. If you cut contact with her, you need to accept that she will tell everyone that you\u2019re the bad guy - consider how that will affect your current relationships and go from there. \n\nThird, you cannot control her behaviour - only your own. What that means is you can\u2019t stop your mom from gambling, but you can make damn sure it isn\u2019t with your money. You also can\u2019t stop your siblings or other family members from giving her money - all you can do is explain to them what will happen with the money, and they\u2019ll have to make their own decisions. \n\nFourth, remember that your dad has been enabling an addict for years. This isn\u2019t to shame him or blame him - enablers are often coerced or manipulated into protecting the addict. And the fact that your dad is disabled means he is likely financially dependent on her, which makes it easier to coerce him. However, this means that he *will not* be an effective ally for you. He will almost always side with your mom because *that\u2019s* who he has to deal with at the end of the day. Just be sure to make a mental note of that if you ask him for help. \n\nFinally, consider therapy for yourself. Being raised by an addict, you\u2019re going to have emotional trauma (emotional neglect at the very least). I know it sounds like it might be \u201cno big deal\u201d, but emotional trauma can have similar long-term psychological effects as physical or sexual abuse. I specialize in emotional trauma and most of my clients have suicidal depression, PTSD, or both - don\u2019t let that happen to you. Process your feelings before they can spend years piling up inside - it\u2019s a lot harder to deal with if you wait. It\u2019s kind of like cancer - you don\u2019t wait to go to the doctor until you\u2019re at Stage IV because then it\u2019s much harder to treat.  \n\nAnyway all that to say - you\u2019re NTA. There\u2019s no guidebook for how to be the child of an addict. Just protect yourself and don\u2019t invest too much mental energy into your mom\u2019s problems- she\u2019s the only one who can decide to get better.", "NTA. You can't heal an addict. And your parents staying together for the kids simply makes no sense when one of the parents is gambling away the money needed for the family. So maybe have that talk with your father about setting up home without your mother. You can't safe her, but you can help each other, if that is what you want. If you want to move out and live your life it is also OK. But don't feed any more money into her addiction.", "NTA. It sound like your mother has a gambling addiction. Like all addictions, she\u2019ll only get better when she is ready. You will not be able to stop this. \n\nHaving said that, you are the child in this family and are not responsible for your siblings or to maintain the house. You may need to move for your own mental health. You can help your siblings in other ways but they are not your responsibility, even though your parents put you in that situation.", "No, not if he follows up.", "NTA I strongly suggest you move out for your sake ASAP. As long as you are there to help, you are enabling her gambling.", "NTA, but now that you know your mother has a gambling problem, STOP handing her cash. If you want to pay off one of the bills, contact the company directly.", "INFO\n\nWhy didn't you confront her about her gambling addiction?", "NTA. You were so generous to give her that money to help. That was no small thing. And to find her blowing it all at a casino? I would love to know if you confronted her there. Op, your mom has an addiction, and while I do not believe it\u2019s your responsibility, you may want to give her resources on how to handle addiction for the sake of your siblings. I don\u2019t know where the future will take you, but I urge you to never leave your younger siblings to her.", "NTA. Tell your siblings so they don\u2019t give her money.", "NTA.  Even parents need tough love.  Your mom has an addiction that's only going to get worse unless she admits to it & gets help.", "NTA.", "NTA but remember that once you leave, your siblings will have no one to protect them and she\u2019ll use them too. Leaving them on the ice alone will make you TA.", "NTA but maybe look into addictions, the addict will always choose the addiction, her #1 relationship is with the addiction, and she will protect it at all costs, yes, even choosing it over family. It's very sad. Try to understand that an addiction is a brain disease, and addicts only change when they decide to, but they have to hit rock bottom. Let her hit rock bottom.", "NTA. You can't change your mother.  But you can control your own choices and behaviour.  You can start by NEVER giving her money again.  If your siblings need food, you can give them food, but your mother will lie, cheat and steal to support her addiction.", "NTA\n\nIn my opinion, you're underreacting.\n\nGambling is an addiction. Money obsessed behavior is usually only given the spotlight for alcoholim and drug abuse, but it's not a behavior specific to either of them. Money obsession is a behavior specific to gambling in general.\n\nYour mother is willing to lie to you. \n\nI don't know how severe your brother's autism is, but your mother is showing that she's willing to take the money of a possibly disabled child who can only depend on her and possibly doesn't know better.\n\nYour sister is underage or is near that.\n\nYour mother is taking advantage of her position. She's clearly guilting your siblings into giving her money for her addiction. You just don't know how far she's gone or if she's done it before.\n\nIf your mom is lying about needing money for bills, then she could've spent the money that was available to her. That could include the grocery budget or money that was supposed to be put away for the future.\n\nIf your mother spent the grocery budget, she's taking food out of your family's mouths.\n\nIf she spent money that was to be put into savings or the future, she's harming your family for the long run. What if there's a medical emergency? An accident? \n\nYou need to take a look at all of the money within your family and make sure it's accounted for.\n\nCheck the family checking and savings accounts. Has she drained the savings or retirement money?\n\nDo your brother or your father receive any monetary benefits? Or, anything that can be converted into something of value?  It's potentially very illegal if your mother missed the funds.\n\nDoes your mother share a banking account with any of the children or her husband? Has there been any cash suddenly disappearing? Can you pull up her credit report to see if she's opened any credit cards for it?", "NTA, but you are sacrificing your life op. It's your dad's job to protect those kids. If he isn't or won't and you're paying the bills anyway,  get custody and take them with you.", "NTA \n\nBut, you had better follow through. Your dad should have alerted someone to the situation so that all the family funds could be safe.", "[removed]", "Yeah, OP make sure you look at your credit reports (dad and even the kids)", "There is also the equivalent of Al Anon for family members of the gambling addict.", "Bot!", "NTA. Wow. You were right to do this. Get a checking account with just YOUR name on it and pay the bills directly. Do not give her any money again.", "Nta bout your father is", "NTA\n\nYour mother is wasting your hard earned money and you have a right to be pissed off and give her an ultimatum. Not too harsh.", "NTA. I do hope you discussed with her why, so after all this time, she was blindsided by all this. Context to know what she is doing wrong so she can work on fixing it. But you aren't wrong for your feelings or for how you handled them.", "NTA. Make sure your brother and sister are on the same page. Can't get money from you they're next. Offer to hold it for them if necessary. Mom won't change till she's ready.", "NTA & in my opinion not to harsh at all.  I probably would have taken it a step further.  I get way your father stayed but he's not doing any of you a favor...", "Nope, NTA.  Maybe what your mother needs to see her addiction.", "Nta", "NTA - but if your threat is empty she's just going to get reenforced into her addiction. You HAVE to put your foot down and be strong about this or she's going to just take nobody seriously ever, and keep walking on them until they really do have enough and all leave her. If you're serious with your threat, it may be a wake up call to how she's treating her family and you can reconcile after healing.", "Nta but realize that your father isn\u2019t necessarily blameless he sounds able enough to have a desk job. People cope in different ways but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to enable them. You should be contributing to the household in the form of rent and that\u2019s might mean paying bills directly instead of to your mom", "NTA. OP, sit down with your siblings and let them know your mother has a gambling addition and to not give her money. Tell them to come to you if she asks. You can also volunteer to open savings accounts with them to keep their money from your mom. I'd also suggest NEVER giving your mom money. Pay bills directly, or not at all.\n\nAnd I'm not sure how old your siblings are, but maybe talk to your dad. Would life be easier if your mom lived elsewhere? I know you said she works and your dad is disabled, but if he gets a check, would it work?", "Assuming they are in the United States, disability is not raising a family money. And depending on how much Dad has worked in the past, disability might be poverty for one person money. Dad might be able to get child support for another couple years, but he is in a really bad situation if he divorces. To be fair he's not in a good situation now, but while it might be a good thing for Dad to explore his options for leaving, they might not be very good. He might feel stuck here for really good reasons.", "I would add plenty of people initially stave off trauma by being hyperfunctional as well as feeling tremendously guilty about setting healthy boundaries. As a result, even after moving on from one addict, they may attract others who consciously or unconsciously manipulate them for their own benefit perpetuating a similar and familiar cycle from the one they grew up in. Starting work on skills like boundary building and unlearning feeling guilty for focusing on your own needs sooner rather than later is important.", "NTA, its sad but If you followed through with it I wonder how you are now, do you wish you hadn't, since you said you were 18 and the time.", "NTA", "Absolutely not, you\u2019re looking at for your family and she used your good heart and hard earned money. NTA", "NTA. She needs more that harshness.", "[removed]", "Because he has no other options and is desperate.  Why are you asking questions that are answered by reading the post?", "NTA", "NTA but your mother has a gambling problem, and the fact that she cannot see that is heartbreaking. She needs professional and 12 step help", "You would only be the asshole if you don't follow through with that... NTA gambling addiction is the worst."]}
