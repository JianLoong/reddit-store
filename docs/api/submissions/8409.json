Unfortunately addicts are liars, and often end up losing everything and everyone. You cannot save an addict from themselves.", "NTA. You and your father seem to be the responsible adults, I suggest looking into resources to help her overcome what sounds like a gambling addiction. Also, change your passwords or pin codes on all credit cards, make sure she hasn't acquired cards or debt in family members' names and do not keep cash in the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can see the medical (brain) side of it but she needs to sort herself out or she is going to lose everything.\n\nYour issue is what happens when you move out.  You are not obligated to your brother, sister or father and definitely not your mother.\n\nI'm guessing you don't want to find your siblings and your dad homeless.  I nearly think your dad is better off divorcing your mother so that he is no longer financially tied to your mother.  Would he get any welfare for his disability?  How old are your siblings now?  Is your sister working now?  What about your brother?  How severe is his ASD?  How old is he?  Can he do some sort of work?  Even from home with your dad's support.\n\nOnce your income is gone from the household, will your mother still pay the bills or will they end up evicted.", "NTA\n\nYou are not an arsehole for saying you will no longer underwrite her gambling addiction. That is perfectly appropriate.\n\nI was about to write that you could, nonetheless, have delivered the message matter of factly, stating exactly what I said above. I was about to write that there was no need to personalise by saying \"I am no longer your son\" -- addiction is, after all, a disease, not a moral failing. ANd you are delivering that message because you care about her and the rest of your family.\n\nBut in your text, I don't see that you actually said \"I am not longer your son\". You said \"I am turning my back on you\", which is not quite the same thing. You further state that you \"took action to threaten our mother-son relationship\". Does that mean you formally sought emancipation as an adult?\n\nIt doesn't sound like you did any of this. Instead, you said you would not have a relationship with her until she gets her gambling under control. I applaud this.", "NTA, but you will probably have to move out. Gambling is an addiction, and like other addictions, is difficult to kick. There is Gamblers Anonymous, similar to AA but for gamblers, but I don't know how good it is or whether there is a group in your area, but if there is, point your mother to it.", "As I had identity theft done against me by my mom, NTA\n\nBut, as others said, you need to be hardcore with this. No empty threats, you leave, stay gone.\n\nSomethings to protect yourself. Make sure you do a credit check on yourself. My mom did a signature loan in my name and I had no idea until a FBI agent came to my government job asking me why I'm not paying my loans.", "Info: why do you think your stern comment is going to change something your father hasn\u2019t been able to address over years? You aren\u2019t the asshole for establishing a boundary but it is a bit immature to think your mother will change her behavior. The ultimatum was pointless as most are.", "NTA", "NTA but you need to move out NOW. You need to make it clear to your siblings they should not give their mother money, and if you don't follow up a warning speech with action, the message won't sink in.\n\nYour mom will NEVER stop. Gambling is am addiction, and addicts can use anybody and tell any lie with an audacity that decent people can't believe humans are capable of. No tactic is too low or mean for them. Yes, I know from personal experience. There was no manipulative tactic my mom was above doing to get money out of her kids, from outright lies to CONSTANT harping on how \"God loves a cheerful giver.\" Just typing that made my stomach turn.\n\nDon't make the same mistakes I made. Cut off your funding NOW and do your best to instill on your siblings that they should never be guilted into supporting her.", "NTA\n\nShe needs a wake up call to see what harm she's doing to everyone, not just herself. Just be sure to follow through. Its not fair on your sibs, but something has to change, either warning letters gets sent or other things happen. I'm sorry that you're going through this", "NTA. Your mom is an addict, plain and simple. Deep down she knows what she's doing is wrong, but she lies to herself and everyone else to justify her actions. This is a compulsion for her and she needs rehab or she will continue to gamble away until your family is homeless. \n\nDo not give her any money. Have a talk with your siblings, heck see if you can set them up bank accounts for their money so it won't be in the house for her to steal or try to guilt them into giving to her. See if you and your dad can set up an account that she doesn't have access to that all the household money goes into. Then try to set up bills so that it's online or automatically drafted from that account so that there's no money loose in the house for her to gain access to. \n\nNormally I'm against cutting off someone financially like that, but I grew up with a gambling addict and they will spend every dime they have on their dopamine rush instead of bills or groceries. So you can't trust them to be responsible.\n\n If she works that's her money. Make it clear she still has responsibilities, but you and your dad need to proceed as if it's only you two with any income and take whatever steps necessary to protect yourselves and your siblings. I'd get valuables like jewelry, watches, etc out of the house into a safe deposit box because as soon as she realizes she is cut off, she will escalate and start trying to steal stuff to get money to feed her addiction.\n\nIf she needs money for specific things like a doctor's appointment or gas, you can go with her and pay or there are specific cards you can use. Like some gas stations have gift cards/prepay cards. Check your health insurance because some offer a medical pay card that you load with money and it's only able to be used for medical bills. My husband's employer has this so we can add a little each month and use it when necessary.  It's called an HSA account. Here's a [link](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-savings-account-hsa/#:~:text=A%20type%20of%20savings%20account,your%20overall%20health%20care%20costs.) with information about it. You may be able to get an HSA on your own too so check with your bank or credit union.\n\nHonestly the best course of action would be to document everything to prove she's a gambling addict and then for your dad to divorce her using that evidence. Your dad would be able to get more assistance without her there and your family would do better financially and mentally without her. It sucks and you feel guilty because she's your mom, but she's an addict and her addiction is a danger to the household. It's best for everyone if she's out of the house.", "My mom is a gambling addict too. It sucks being the kid of an addict. Sure, it motivated me to become a psychologist, but my childhood was trash a lot of the time. So I completely understand the urge to cut contact, and no, you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for doing so.  But I want you to have realistic expectations for what will happen. \n\nFirst, your mom will not change because you cut contact. She has deep-rooted psychological pain that she\u2019s coping with by gambling - some people drink, others cut themselves, our moms gamble. And until she accepts that she needs help and goes to therapy (to learn more adaptive coping mechanisms), she won\u2019t change. And you can\u2019t make her change - so try not to waste your time or energy convincing her to. \n\nSecond, she will demonize you and make you out to be the bad guy. Addicts are experts at this. They\u2019re often spinning the narrative so that they\u2019re the misunderstood victim and everyone else is the uncompassionate asshole. If you cut contact with her, you need to accept that she will tell everyone that you\u2019re the bad guy - consider how that will affect your current relationships and go from there. \n\nThird, you cannot control her behaviour - only your own. What that means is you can\u2019t stop your mom from gambling, but you can make damn sure it isn\u2019t with your money. You also can\u2019t stop your siblings or other family members from giving her money - all you can do is explain to them what will happen with the money, and they\u2019ll have to make their own decisions. \n\nFourth, remember that your dad has been enabling an addict for years. This isn\u2019t to shame him or blame him - enablers are often coerced or manipulated into protecting the addict. And the fact that your dad is disabled means he is likely financially dependent on her, which makes it easier to coerce him. However, this means that he *will not* be an effective ally for you. He will almost always side with your mom because *that\u2019s* who he has to deal with at the end of the day. Just be sure to make a mental note of that if you ask him for help. \n\nFinally, consider therapy for yourself. Being raised by an addict, you\u2019re going to have emotional trauma (emotional neglect at the very least). I know it sounds like it might be \u201cno big deal\u201d, but emotional trauma can have similar long-term psychological effects as physical or sexual abuse. I specialize in emotional trauma and most of my clients have suicidal depression, PTSD, or both - don\u2019t let that happen to you. Process your feelings before they can spend years piling up inside - it\u2019s a lot harder to deal with if you wait. It\u2019s kind of like cancer - you don\u2019t wait to go to the doctor until you\u2019re at Stage IV because then it\u2019s much harder to treat.  \n\nAnyway all that to say - you\u2019re NTA. There\u2019s no guidebook for how to be the child of an addict. Just protect yourself and don\u2019t invest too much mental energy into your mom\u2019s problems- she\u2019s the only one who can decide to get better.", "NTA. You can't heal an addict. And your parents staying together for the kids simply makes no sense when one of the parents is gambling away the money needed for the family. So maybe have that talk with your father about setting up home without your mother. You can't safe her, but you can help each other, if that is what you want. If you want to move out and live your life it is also OK. But don't feed any more money into her addiction.", "NTA. It sound like your mother has a gambling addiction. Like all addictions, she\u2019ll only get better when she is ready. You will not be able to stop this. \n\nHaving said that, you are the child in this family and are not responsible for your siblings or to maintain the house. You may need to move for your own mental health. You can help your siblings in other ways but they are not your responsibility, even though your parents put you in that situation.", "No, not if he follows up."]}
