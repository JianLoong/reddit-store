Your mother is the one letting you and the rest of the family down by gambling away your money. She broke your trust and now she has to earn it back. It will take time but if she gets help for her addiction it could happen. \n\nAre there any other family members you could reach out to in order to help get her some support? A grandparent or aunt/uncle? \n\nI hope you can move out soon and be free from her manipulation.", "NTA I am not sure what your relationship with your mother has been in the past, but just hearing this story. Your mother does not seem like a good person. She is manipulating you, and your siblings to give her money for gambling. Because of that, I think your actions are justified. I hope that she gets help for her gambling addiction. I am also sorry you have to go through this.", "NTA. Your mother is being manipulative and not taking responsibility for her gambling problem. Unfortunately addicts are liars, and often end up losing everything and everyone. You cannot save an addict from themselves.", "NTA. You and your father seem to be the responsible adults, I suggest looking into resources to help her overcome what sounds like a gambling addiction. Also, change your passwords or pin codes on all credit cards, make sure she hasn't acquired cards or debt in family members' names and do not keep cash in the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can see the medical (brain) side of it but she needs to sort herself out or she is going to lose everything.\n\nYour issue is what happens when you move out.  You are not obligated to your brother, sister or father and definitely not your mother.\n\nI'm guessing you don't want to find your siblings and your dad homeless.  I nearly think your dad is better off divorcing your mother so that he is no longer financially tied to your mother.  Would he get any welfare for his disability?  How old are your siblings now?  Is your sister working now?  What about your brother?  How severe is his ASD?  How old is he?  Can he do some sort of work?  Even from home with your dad's support.\n\nOnce your income is gone from the household, will your mother still pay the bills or will they end up evicted.", "NTA\n\nYou are not an arsehole for saying you will no longer underwrite her gambling addiction. That is perfectly appropriate.\n\nI was about to write that you could, nonetheless, have delivered the message matter of factly, stating exactly what I said above. I was about to write that there was no need to personalise by saying \"I am no longer your son\" -- addiction is, after all, a disease, not a moral failing. ANd you are delivering that message because you care about her and the rest of your family.\n\nBut in your text, I don't see that you actually said \"I am not longer your son\". You said \"I am turning my back on you\", which is not quite the same thing. You further state that you \"took action to threaten our mother-son relationship\". Does that mean you formally sought emancipation as an adult?\n\nIt doesn't sound like you did any of this. Instead, you said you would not have a relationship with her until she gets her gambling under control. I applaud this.", "NTA, but you will probably have to move out. Gambling is an addiction, and like other addictions, is difficult to kick. There is Gamblers Anonymous, similar to AA but for gamblers, but I don't know how good it is or whether there is a group in your area, but if there is, point your mother to it.", "As I had identity theft done against me by my mom, NTA\n\nBut, as others said, you need to be hardcore with this. No empty threats, you leave, stay gone.\n\nSomethings to protect yourself. Make sure you do a credit check on yourself. My mom did a signature loan in my name and I had no idea until a FBI agent came to my government job asking me why I'm not paying my loans."]}
