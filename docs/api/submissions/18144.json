He asked me if it was cool to invite her for dinner, I say no problem, and help buy groceries for the dinner at 6:30pm on a weekday night.

Eventually I say \"I need to go to bed\", and do so - they are still up and talking so loudly at nearly midnight that I'm texting him to wrap it up. I'd normally go out and say so, but the fact that this kid is closely associated with a rather judgmental gossipy colleague makes it pretty weird to stomp out in my pajamas and tell them both to wrap it up or go somewhere else. Eventually she leaves, I tell him it was super inconsiderate.\n\nI feel like the situation has a lot of weird red flags and shitty boundaries in general, but I spent the following day exhausted, not really able to do the work that I need to do, and not really inviting conversation aside from expressing it was disrespectful and inconsiderate in the morning before leaving the flat. I feel guilty that I am spoiling a connection he has to home, but I also feel like they could manage to do that at a bar and keep me out of it.\n\nedit with more context: He's known the parent for 7+ years, and the kid for probably as long, they have a relationship where he could tell her to buzz off and I don't. We've also had multiple conflicts about him disrupting my sleep this week (think running the dryer at 4am), and I have a major career impacting work deadline in four days, so my fuse is shorter than standard.", "created_utc": 1685016928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rg6h1/aita_for_getting_upset_over_a_dinner_gone_on_too/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should have had the basic consideration to cut things off at a reasonable hour on a work night or at the very least try to keep quiet. He\u2019s even more of an AH for lack of consideration being a normal thing.", ">We've also had multiple conflicts about him disrupting my sleep this week (think running the dryer at 4am), and I have a major career impacting work deadline in four days\n\nAre you sure he should have moved in with you?", "NTA- and there seems to be some pattern of disrespect going on here generally. I think you need to decide if there's something larger going on. If it was the one night, eh, but repeatedly over a short period of time where he knows you're under extra stress from work is more than a little bit shitty. It's inconsiderate at best and sabotage or worse in the other end. Basically, there's no good excuse for it and it is a major red flag for me.  The question is- are there others?", "NAH. It\u2019s normal to be annoyed that you couldn\u2019t sleep, but in the same way that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking her to leave, maybe he also didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking her to leave. Also, perhaps in his mind it\u2019s normal to have guests stay so late. \n\nNext time, take guests to a restaurant.", "He might not feel comfortable going to the bar with her", "NTA. Tell him to please mind your sleep schedule more because it's a stressful time. If he finally respects your boundaries, i'll change my judgment.", "NAH but you could let it go. It may have been awkward for him to kick her out (most people would have gotten the hint after you went to bed). It's one bad night's sleep, you'll be ok.", "\"they could do that at the bar\"\n\nInfo: did you say and/or ask him this before the dinner? Maybe \"we have dinner here, but by 9pm you have to go to the bar, etc. because I need to sleep\"\n\n Have you talked to him about the previous sleep interruptions? And that now is even more important because of this major work deadline?", "NAH. \nOne night of crappy sleep isn't the end of the world, OP. Let it go after this post.", "This has happened only one time. Seems like there\u2019s maybe more to the story or you may be overreacting.\n\nI\u2019m guessing they spent a lot of time catching up because they don\u2019t see each other often. If it happens again, ask them to meet somewhere else. You don\u2019t have to host a dinner just to be polite. \n\nI think you may have just been tired & annoyed.\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s one night. It happens. Sometimes guests don\u2019t realize they have overstayed their welcome.\n\nI honestly think you are tired and you are over reacting", "NAH. it just something that happens with family but I would also get pissed anytime someone started a racket at 6 am or otherwise disturbed my schedule because they know I have to work so the least they can do is accommodate me by reducing my stress at home.   \n\n\nIts night like she is flying to home country the next day. I don't see why they could not wrap it up and then meet up for another dinner at a different time. I mean the flow of conversation could not have been THAT good.", "YTA - one day doesn\u2019t matter, you can be tired for a day and call an early night the next day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I work with dangerous equipment and maths and it's hard to adequately do either if I'm running on fumes.", "Fair, but then she probably shouldn't be drinking wine at our place all night either.

He needs to start respecting your boundaries and be more understanding, otherwise you should reconsider having him as your partner. \n\n\nYou already have to deal w stressful 12hr shifts, you don't need lack/disruption of sleep to contribute to that as well", "Overall NTA because you are sleep deprived already, but you are a bit, it's normal to talk with someone you haven't seen for ages.", "He definitely should not have, no. At best they aren't compatible at worst he's an assholr and even sabotaging her."]}
