He should have had the basic consideration to cut things off at a reasonable hour on a work night or at the very least try to keep quiet. He\u2019s even more of an AH for lack of consideration being a normal thing.", ">We've also had multiple conflicts about him disrupting my sleep this week (think running the dryer at 4am), and I have a major career impacting work deadline in four days\n\nAre you sure he should have moved in with you?", "NTA- and there seems to be some pattern of disrespect going on here generally. I think you need to decide if there's something larger going on. If it was the one night, eh, but repeatedly over a short period of time where he knows you're under extra stress from work is more than a little bit shitty. It's inconsiderate at best and sabotage or worse in the other end. Basically, there's no good excuse for it and it is a major red flag for me.  The question is- are there others?", "NAH. It\u2019s normal to be annoyed that you couldn\u2019t sleep, but in the same way that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking her to leave, maybe he also didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking her to leave. Also, perhaps in his mind it\u2019s normal to have guests stay so late. \n\nNext time, take guests to a restaurant.", "He might not feel comfortable going to the bar with her", "NTA. Tell him to please mind your sleep schedule more because it's a stressful time. If he finally respects your boundaries, i'll change my judgment.", "NAH but you could let it go. It may have been awkward for him to kick her out (most people would have gotten the hint after you went to bed). It's one bad night's sleep, you'll be ok.", "\"they could do that at the bar\"\n\nInfo: did you say and/or ask him this before the dinner? Maybe \"we have dinner here, but by 9pm you have to go to the bar, etc. because I need to sleep\"\n\n Have you talked to him about the previous sleep interruptions?

Let it go after this post.", "This has happened only one time. Seems like there\u2019s maybe more to the story or you may be overreacting.\n\nI\u2019m guessing they spent a lot of time catching up because they don\u2019t see each other often.

It happens.

I don't see why they could not wrap it up and then meet up for another dinner at a different time.

I work with dangerous equipment and maths and it's hard to adequately do either if I'm running on fumes.", "Fair, but then she probably shouldn't be drinking wine at our place all night either. I suggested the bar because it would be considerate to go somewhere else if they want to continue late into the night and it's not my place to dictate their relationship.", "Yes, he is fully aware that I am under a massive time crunch for work, and that previous issues this week have interfered with my ability to do my job well.\n\nI did not think it was necessary to tell him that a 6:30pm dinner with a kid I've never met before should not go until after midnight on a weekday given the circumstances.", "They saw one another less than 2 months ago, so it's not terribly pressing.\n\nAgree that I am tired and annoyed.", "You need to set parameters with your partner for how late guests can be there after dinner and at what point he needs to tell this one to buzz off. \n\nIf he routinely disrupts your sleep the two of you need to have a separate conversation about that.\n\nAfter that, if sleep disruption continues, you need to think about the relationship entirely", "I think this may be more about your stress level.

He needs to start respecting your boundaries and be more understanding, otherwise you should reconsider having him as your partner. \n\n\nYou already have to deal w stressful 12hr shifts, you don't need lack/disruption of sleep to contribute to that as well", "Overall NTA because you are sleep deprived already, but you are a bit, it's normal to talk with someone you haven't seen for ages.", "He definitely should not have, no. At best they aren't compatible at worst he's an assholr and even sabotaging her.", "Um, not to be that Redditer, but you say your partner, who recently relocated to your home (why?), is doing things that could potentially sabotage your performance at a high-stress job? Interesting. Do you think he wants you to quit, or could he be jealous of your achievements and not want you to get promoted? Even if you don't want to believe this could be true, all of the things he's doing, ESPECIALLY last night's \"dinner,\" are annoying and show a lack of respect for you. The dinner was just extra weird, though. \n\nBottom line is: How much do you like your job? If you like it, and you want to keep doing it, I would deeply consider finding your own place to be until you pass that deadline.", "INFO: Do they sell earplugs in this small country?\n\nI'm not sure it's reasonable to expect an adult to sit on their hands staring at a wall in their own home.", "NTA but kind of YTA \n\nI mean, you are within your rights to leave and go to bed but if you are a light sleeper you might need ear plugs. Those are easy to procure and would allow an occasional later night to occur given your apt is small.\n\nIf he did this every night, that would be another thing. \n\nBut also he should be allowed to entertain at home on occasion.", "NTA disrespectful on both their parts. Read the room.", "NTA. This had a significant impact on you.

(They can find a place they like and look forward to it)\n\nC. Is it hosting them at a restaurant where they can stay as late as they want and you can leave?\n\nD. Is it finding a day where they can stay late at your house but you are best able to deal/rest the next day?", "NTA. It's common sense to not have a guest over late on a weeknight.\n\nBut when my husband and I first started living together, he moved into my small one-bedroom apartment. We got in each other's hair a lot, he sort of crammed his stuff in around mine, and I felt  territorial and cranky. We just didn't have enough space or peace. \n\nWe got along much better once we moved into a slightly larger place elsewhere in the building. More space and a fresh start. We also started taking turns giving each other the place to ourselves. \n\nIf possible, I'd set some ground rules to reduce these tiffs.\n\nA partner is still a roommate.", "I feel like the biggest issue is that he doesn't seem to respect your sleep. Does he work? Because who runs the dryer at 4? I only do that if I'm home alone and like.. fried or something. I'd say NTA, and usually I'd say he's also NTA, because a visit from a family friend or loved one is a special occasion, but it isn't the special occasions it happens. He seems to not respect your sleep schedule and therefore career.", "Slight YTA. I live in a house with other people that stay up later fhan me and/or have to get up earlier. It\u2019s my own responsibility to manage my sleep and manage my stress. White noise machine, ear plugs, exercise etc", "if you have such a deadline and clearly haven't been sleeping due to other things why agree to the dinner at all? i would have said next week is better.", "You should check out OP's edit, sounds like the partner is doing this (interrupting her sleep) every night.", "No point wasting your life on inconsiderate people. Kick him out and live a better life.", "yeah that is different and makes her frustration much different and more justified...  but also -- not really about this particular incident."]}
