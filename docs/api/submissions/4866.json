This week he shared that he was debt free after 12 months of saving and paying things off and we celebrate and congratulated him. He didn't sale any of the purchases", "Definitely NTA with this kind of behaviour. I'd suggest future trips with Jim that you say pay in full before no fee cancellation dates close. I'd also chat with Jake about this kind of behaviour so he's aware of why there's new holiday paying agreements.", "In that case NTA.  Debt free and not willing to pay for a trip he suggested.  Not only that, trying to make you feel guilty about it.  What an AH.", "Good idea, I doubt that he will go NC with us and not pay but better be safe and I'll talk to Jake", "NTA, but you know when January rolls around he's going to try to tag along because \"There's space for one more\", right?", "NTA.\n\nYou were very clear about what payments needed to be done.  You even texted him an offer of cancellation and he then put all you guys on the hook for it.

So you can see what the actual cost is.", "NTA. Jim may learn to pay closer attention to details in the future.", "NTA. Idk there's much to judge here. The people who paid are going on the trip. \n\nI do think it was risky turning this into a \"OP loans his friends funds\" situation by not requiring payment the moment the cancellation period ended.  You were able to front the entire cost of the trip, so the other attendees should be expected to pay their share once the cancellation window closes. Though I'm privileged with a disposable income so trying to include him was probably worthwhile for the sake of including him. \n\nBut yeah, in the end, again, everyone who didn't need to cancel the plans ended up confirming on going and paid their fair share.  He's soft AH for backing out of a payment agreement, but really doesn't look like much harm was done here. He's not wrong to ask for your compassion during his financial struggle, but he was remiss in planning his budget when putting you on the hook for paying up front for him, which you are right to be upset about and point out. \n\nI don't see that anyone is upset about y'all going anyway. Rest assured y'all are in the moral clear. Bummer he can't go, but he'd be TA if he expected y'all to eat the loss on your payments if y'all cancelled solely to prevent his FOMO", "NTA.

He has never failed to pay so I didn't have reason to not believe him, he is the kind of person that complains about spending money but still does", "He does bail, he says he will have dinner and then not show up because he was asleep, went to the wrong location (even when we sent the address), said he didn't have money after accepting. At the end he pays his things but always complains about spending and not having money but days after comes bragging that spent over 1k in car parts.\n\nI'm aware that he might do that tagging along thing, I set boundaries with the others that we are going without him no matter what, we won't allow this behavior to continue", "I bet he'll still expect for him and his partner to go on the trip since its paid for 6 instead of 4.", "I would not plan anymore trips with him without a rule that he either pays up by the last cancellation date or he is out.

Isn\u2019t empathy a two way street?", "I second this. The only way to go is 100% payment before the cancellation window or you don\u2019t go.

It's a group choice, votes get counted, budgets discussed. If someone doesn't go then, they lose their deposit while everyone else attends. But they are expected to stump up the rest, as we all would have chosen somewhere else initially if they weren't going, somewhere for 11 of us instead of 12 or 10 instead of 12 etc... And expecting those who went to simply pay more. We all make the same plan and committment, we all have the same time to see ahead and budget.", "Too bad for old mate. The ship has sailed.\n\nAnd he didn't pay his deposit, he can't get on.", "No, for sure but the idea is - say yesterday he\u2019d lost his job unexpectedly or had his car totaled then saying *come on you knew about the cancellation deadline ten days ago* would be a bit harsh. His expectation for empathy in that situation would have made more sense but OP confirmed this wasn\u2019t the case.", "Yep, he was thinking that you guys would pay for it and he would still get to go because he always went.", "I'm very happy that your friend is out of his difficult situation! It may spread good will and reduce any chance of hard feelings if you allow him back on if he wants to and can pay his share (assuming nothing was cancelled due to his dropping out, since y'all are still paying full price). If he can't, yeah he'll feel bad, but he won't feel purposely excluded. \n\nRegarding the credit card bill not having cost you anything financially until your billing date: your lodging cost was nonrefundable. The credit card payment being due EOM is a pertinent detail but you accepted the bill on your ledger immediately, and it became completely committed after 48 hours. Good budgeting practice is to consider that money spent at that point (at least that's how I treat credit card charges. It's earmarked and gone, it cannot be spent on something else). It's very difficult and tricky to look at the credit as a debt rather than a spent amount, I've found. Kudos to you if you're able to reliably budget while keeping track of every credit card's individual due date and spending that money before payment is due. Maybe folks with more accounting chops than I can do it, but I certainly can't and I budget diligently. \n\nGood luck!", "In his book the trip is cancelled, he doesn't know our plan of going", "Wow, what is wrong with you? You say \"in that case\" as if she somehow owes him a vacation if he was responsible with his money?

Dear God.\n\nHe may have been robbed, spent all his money on medical bills, gambled it all during a psychotic episode brought on by grief, given it all to a homeless mother of five, etc. etc..  I never said he wasn't responsible or that she owed him a holiday, I was just checking she hadn't left out the part where she was the evil and callous woman stomping on his kind and wounded heart, which would have made her the AH in this scenario.

I took my car to restoration a month ago with only 2/3 of estimated payment to give to shop owner aswell (owner agreed since he's my good friends neighbor) and got it back few days ago and paid the rest i owed upon receiving it on spot.

You didn't actually do anything wrong. I feel like it is such a shame when there is a clear asshole and the good guys go down too because they responded in a way that hurts.
