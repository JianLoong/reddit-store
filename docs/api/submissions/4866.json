This week he shared that he was debt free after 12 months of saving and paying things off and we celebrate and congratulated him. He didn't sale any of the purchases", "Definitely NTA with this kind of behaviour. I'd suggest future trips with Jim that you say pay in full before no fee cancellation dates close. I'd also chat with Jake about this kind of behaviour so he's aware of why there's new holiday paying agreements.", "In that case NTA.  Debt free and not willing to pay for a trip he suggested.  Not only that, trying to make you feel guilty about it.  What an AH.", "Good idea, I doubt that he will go NC with us and not pay but better be safe and I'll talk to Jake", "NTA, but you know when January rolls around he's going to try to tag along because \"There's space for one more\", right?", "NTA.\n\nYou were very clear about what payments needed to be done.  You even texted him an offer of cancellation and he then put all you guys on the hook for it.  That was very inconsiderate.\n\nI dunno what you want to do about this friendship, but trusting him financially is off the table now.", "This guy is inconsiderate beyond words . empathy? F\u2026k him", "NTA, but you should have pushed it then when he said he didn't have the money.", "NTA- he knew what was expected and agreed. I have been in a situation like this and it\u2019s stressful. If he didn\u2019t have the money or wasn\u2019t taking it seriously he shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it.", "NTA", "Don't be surprised when he tries to tag along anyways or changes his mind. NTA though. Does he usually bail on plans or balk about paying his way? If not typical behavior I'd have whomever is closest to him reach out and ask if he's okay and if there's something going on.", "NTA he\u2019s 33 he needs to grow up.", "NTA.\n\nBeing that he is in debt quote needlessly because of frivolous luxury purchases, I would say it's quite obvious that Buddy doesn't have a good handle on making financial decisions.\n\nIt's nice to plan trips with friends, personally, the future I would calculate two sets of numbers. 1 for if Buddy follows through, and the other for when Buddy drops the ball. So you can see what the actual cost is.", "NTA. Jim may learn to pay closer attention to details in the future.", "NTA. Idk there's much to judge here. The people who paid are going on the trip. \n\nI do think it was risky turning this into a \"OP loans his friends funds\" situation by not requiring payment the moment the cancellation period ended.  You were able to front the entire cost of the trip, so the other attendees should be expected to pay their share once the cancellation window closes. Though I'm privileged with a disposable income so trying to include him was probably worthwhile for the sake of including him. \n\nBut yeah, in the end, again, everyone who didn't need to cancel the plans ended up confirming on going and paid their fair share.  He's soft AH for backing out of a payment agreement, but really doesn't look like much harm was done here. He's not wrong to ask for your compassion during his financial struggle, but he was remiss in planning his budget when putting you on the hook for paying up front for him, which you are right to be upset about and point out. \n\nI don't see that anyone is upset about y'all going anyway. Rest assured y'all are in the moral clear. Bummer he can't go, but he'd be TA if he expected y'all to eat the loss on your payments if y'all cancelled solely to prevent his FOMO", "NTA. He was hoping that he would still get to go when the booking was still in place after the due date.", "NTA. My MIL was like you in she would book places and breakdown the cost and dates money needed to be paid by. There was always someone or a few people who suddenly couldn\u2019t come up with the funds, had to cancel, etc. This happened so many times that she now refuses to book anything for anyone except herself and family. She\u2019ll send people the hotel/airb n b listings still available and that\u2019s it. Everyone is on their own.", "That's when you say \"glad to have you! We'll need payment in full no less than 48 hrs before the first day, which will include a $25 convenience fee per person in the group who covered a share of your share of the fee when your dropped out after the cancellation date had passed. \"", ">but perhaps you were too blunt at a difficult time?\n\nWe're not talking about rent money. This is a vacation.", "He WANTS compassion and empathy\u2026..yet doesn\u2019t seem to feel you and the others deserve compassion and empathy for your work on this and the damage to your pocketbooks!", "Right, that is what upsets me. Is the lack of respect towards us", "Definitely that is off the table, the reason he still in our life is because my husband is having a harder time letting go, but with this and other things he has done is clearly in a different life path and not bringing much to my life.", "I did the first time and he got offended saying that he was just venting and that I was taking his comment personally and he would figure out the money. He has never failed to pay so I didn't have reason to not believe him, he is the kind of person that complains about spending money but still does", "He does bail, he says he will have dinner and then not show up because he was asleep, went to the wrong location (even when we sent the address), said he didn't have money after accepting. At the end he pays his things but always complains about spending and not having money but days after comes bragging that spent over 1k in car parts.\n\nI'm aware that he might do that tagging along thing, I set boundaries with the others that we are going without him no matter what, we won't allow this behavior to continue", "I bet he'll still expect for him and his partner to go on the trip since its paid for 6 instead of 4.", "I would not plan anymore trips with him without a rule that he either pays up by the last cancellation date or he is out. Where is his \u201c empathy \u201c for people that have to pay cash that could have been used for entertainment because he was to inconsiderate to cancel? Isn\u2019t empathy a two way street?", "I second this. The only way to go is 100% payment before the cancellation window or you don\u2019t go. But you need a cheaper backup Airbnb option if it falls through or the result is the same \u2014 everyone else pays more money"]}
