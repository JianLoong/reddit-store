Anyone who wants more than one (or more than two per couple -- and new partners do not warrant an extra!) should have to buy a voucher from someone who is not using theirs.

I've never heard of people having children to replace themselves though.\n\nFor some reason a post I read a few weeks ago popped in my head. It was siblings and I think there were four or five and all of them had a buttload of kids except one who didn't and she had money, while the ones with kids were broke. And apparently the parents had a bunch of kids and they kept saying stuff like the most important thing you can do is have a big family then you're truly wealthy, but they were always broke. So the ones with all the kids were trying to shame the one without the kids... The post was actually about them wanting the money from the one without the kids, but it made me think of this because it's so similar with the people with all the kids shaming the people who don't have them.

But you knew this.\n\nHowever, you did basically make it seem like they were spending a massive amount of time, effort and money to do you a favour, even if it was a joke. And the woman carried 4 pregnancies to do it, with all the risk it entails. You must have looked like a full blown AH to her eyes when you said that.\n\nThere's also a massive birthrate problem in the western world, and couples like you ARE THE PROBLEM.
