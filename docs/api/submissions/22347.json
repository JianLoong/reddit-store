I'm Muslim and the fact that you're so terse about her wanting to revert to Islam and her Muslim fiance shows that you not only handled things poorly, you don't care about your daughter at all.  Islam is a beautiful religion and the fact you're not even taking the time to learn some about Islam and firmly believing that she's going to Hell is not showing love to your daughter at all.  Love is learning about Islam, not necessarily reverting/converting, but learning about it.  Love is true acceptance of your daughter, her choices, and her fiance.  Love is not telling your own daughter she's going to Hell.  Telling someone you believe they're going to Hell is not any kind of way to show that you're trying to adjust.  Love is embracing a good, solid man into the family.  Love is being considerate of the Muslim religion and the company you were in to refrain from eating something that is not eaten in Islam (while we're on the subject, and even though it's only mentioned once, Leviticus 11:7 also tells you to not eat pork, and once is more than enough); I mean, would it really have hurt you to refrained from having pork that meal?\n\nActing cold and being unaccepting towards others is not what God teaches in either Islam or Catholicism.  Jesus said, \"Love one another as I have loved you and love your neighbour as yourself.\"  Islam has the same prophets as you, the same God as you. \n\nPlease find it within yourself to change your heart.  It is not your place to judge.  Only God is the Judge.", "YTA\n\nTell me if I'm wrong but from your comments I can see helplessness regarding your daughter's decision. Helplessness to understand and do and say what's right for her and yourself. \n\nHowever, if your faith makes it so easy for you to say that your own child will go to hell then it's your faith that's vile and poisonous and I'd seriously contemplate the beliefs that lead to such conclusion if I were you. You might not like it, might not like that your daughter doesn't share your faith and openly states her dislike but you chose the absolute worst thing to say to your child. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with what she says give her boundaries. That's the adult thing to do. Ask her to respect your faith but also respect hers and her choices. Educate yourself to understand her decision. Because no matter how faithful you are to Christianity what harm does it do to be tolerant and accepting and maybe even learn from other religions?

The Catholic clergy, for all its deep DEEP flaws, has a rich history of critically examining the Bible and all of its various interpretations, and a plethora of differing opinions between priests, bishops, even popes. This should also apply to the laypeople - don't take everything that's been taught to you at face value, including your belief that anyone who doesn't accept Jesus as the One True Savior is likely going to Hell. Catholic doctrine is not without its flaws (beavers were once classified as fish so they could be eaten during Lent, for Pete's sake), including anything stating that non-believers are going to Hell.\n\nI'd also encourage you to learn more about Islam. We have much more in common than most Christians think, and it's worth learning what your daughter and future son-in-law's religion is actually about. This shouldn't surprise anyone but groups like al-Qaeda do not accurately reflect mainstream Muslim faith; it's a beautiful and compassionate religion. Other religions are not a threat to you, and if you don't believe me, [maybe you'll believe Pope Francis himself.](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/04/03/pope-francis-dont-be-afraid-god-has-allowed-different-religions-world)\n\nI do hope you can patch things up with your daughter - hell, I'll even pray you can. And hopefully it comes after a lot of reflection on your part and a genuine apology to her and your future relatives.", "NTA. Someone else\u2019s religion shouldn\u2019t dictate what food you eat. Also, if you truly believe that non Christians are going to hell you should be truthful about that.

Where was her fianc\u00e9 saying it was okay for you to order what you want? \n\nI think you handled it fine and I don\u2019t blame you for struggling with it tbh. She\u2019s an adult that can make her own choices. I\u2019m not religious so the hell thing is whatever, but hey - don\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answer to, right - especially while also expecting that person to cater to someone else\u2019s belief.", "NTA. You could probably try harder, but daughter asked a question she *knew* the answer to, and if she meant anything else, she shouldve asked that instead. Love all the YTA votes because they don't like that you are religious but ignore the fact that if your daughter didn't convert and commit to raising the children as Muslims then the marriage likely wouldn't even be happening. Husbands parents likely would not support the marriage. But hey, they can't be the assholes for insisting on religious conversion, it's their culture! Just you and your beliefs are bad!

And BTW if you had hoped of her ever coming back to your faith, it\u2019s never going to happen now.", "NTA.  It's a hard thing when a child goes so far from how you raised them.  That is one heck of a conversion.     Faith is a deep-seated matter. Your feelings are valid.. I wonder if the inlaws are having similar struggles..", "NTA. I'm a full-on atheist but it's always so cringe to me when atheists don't care to understand the perspective of believers. I always find their lack of empathy ironic because atheists often hate cultural centrism, but that is exactly what they practice when they haughtily put down the deep-seated values of other religious cultures. I think people here need a reality check that for a mother who genuinely believes her daughter is destroying her life and damning herself to eternal hellfire, this woman is taking the situation surprisingly well.\n\nYou are a catholic. You believe those that do not serve god and the catholic faith will go to hell. Your daughter specifically asked you for your opinion, and you gave it to her honestly, which by the way is what your faith calls you to do. The other people in this thread who don't understand Catholicism are probably projecting their feelings toward their disapproving religious parents onto you. You did nothing wrong here. You have a right to disapprove of (and actually be *extremely* upset about) a marriage that you believe jeopardizes your daughter's eternal soul.\n\nI think this was just a bad interaction between you and your daughter, because she happened to want to elicit a negative response from you when she asked if you thought she'd go to hell. I think there's a way you can stand firm on your beliefs, while making it clear that you love her and want the best for her.

You answering that way and really giving your thoughts on it and only (also saying only God really knows) is as best of an answer you could have given. I'm just some rando on reddit, but for what its worth I do think you handled it gracefully - asking the wrong crowd though. Reddit isn't exactly friendly to Catholics as you can probably see from the comments. \n\nTheres another matter here that could be at play. Why is she converting? I don't know if you've discussed this with her. If you havent, you should consider it but with no prior judgement. Help her and guide her through this no matter what she chooses, only time will tell what happens with this situation but best you can do is be supportive and show her you love her.\n\nGetting guidance from your church could help you and/or possibly your daughter  - do be supportive though and don't let your thoughts on it bias your love for her or her fiance.

If she and her new tribe want to adhere to their own dietary laws, that's up to them. Is she not rejecting your faith by converting? How is that not disrespectful? If your husband is Catholic, how is it he is so willing to bend over backwards to accept this conversion?

You should have asked her why she even came up with that?", "NTA", "NTA for what you said to your daughter, but the belief itself is a-holish.  How arrogant for ANY religion to assume that their way is the only way to heaven.  The TRUTH is, no one knows what the truth is, and no one knows what happens after we die.  \n\nYou are also NTA for having concerns about her conversion to another religion, and her attempting to police your dinner is worrisome already.  She doesn't get to dictate what anyone else eats.  If her future in-laws are offended that you ate pork in their presence, that's their problem.", "NTA since you are entitled to believe what is taught in Catholicism. \n\nYour daughter and her soon to be husband and in-laws probably think you are going to hell too since you are not following Islam.", "I\u2019m going with NTA because I can only imagine my family\u2019s reaction if I were to have converted from our religion to be with my husband. It wouldn\u2019t have gone well and I don\u2019t think my parents would have made even a tenth of the effort you have made. I think your daughter was a bit reactive and definitely super defensive about things which tells me maybe she isn\u2019t as cool with converting as she seems. Expecting you to know what meats are ok to order according to her in laws religion is a bit weird. Also if your kid asks you if you think they are going to hell? To me that shows they are asking themselves that question and haven\u2019t come up with an answer they feel right about yet. \n\nFor some background I grew up in a fairly fundamentalist Christian community and was a full time missionary for 4 years after graduation, but I went through some really horrible experiences with my leadership which forced me to reevaluate my faith. While I haven\u2019t left the religion entirely, I\u2019ve stopped attending church and even that has lead to asking myself some pretty existential questions. My family has stayed supportive however which has helped. I can only imagine how much she is thinking through if you raised her in one faith tradition and she\u2019s chosen to leave it for a guy. \n\nSo to sup up: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for responding honestly when she asked you such a pointed question. I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for ordering pork at dinner if you honestly didn\u2019t know it was offensive.

No one knows for a fact. I  think the only time there is a problem is when others lash out in hate. We are all human, and we don't have to agree with what others do or believe. We just need to take care of ourselves. I have an issue when someone shoves their ideals down my throat. Not an \"I believe this...,\" but \"I believe this way and so must you,\" or \"This is how I live, so must you.\" We are all free to make our own decisions, however, we do have to live with the consequences.\nTry talking to your daughter again on her time.", "NTA. I think for what you wrote you handled the situation with as much grace and mercy as you could. It is her choice whom she marries and how she reacts to the conversation you had with her.

She wanted to feel in the right, righteous in her anger or opinion. \n\nThings may change for your daughter in time as she matures.

They have never once asked either my bf or me to not eat beef, we just avoid ordering it when we eat with them - it doesn\u2019t kill anyone to order chicken or lamb or beef - OP choosing to order the one meat her daughter\u2019s future family is Strictly no no about is disrespectful", "and exactly how the fuck is one supposed to know what respect is to a religion they aren't a part of.  Fuck all religious everything.  If op wants a pork chop, she should order one.  If anybody is going to be offended by that, they should have not gone to a place that sells pork chops.

However I think she should have deferred the conversation for another time if daughter would have allowed it. But, I do think it was thoughtless to order pork around the new in-law family. It such an easy thing to avoid it and just order something non-controversial (chicken, beef, vegetarian) that wouldn\u2019t make them uncomfortable. I\u2019m sure OP didn\u2019t do it on purpose, just thoughtless, but this was a major occasion, try to avoid any unnecessary clash of values/ culture/ religion.

Those are the things they \u201cpick and choose\u201d. If you choose to believe that you do not have to believe that Jesus is your lord and savior in order to escape hell, then you have chosen to not be Christian, much less Catholic.

You gotta realize that logic isn\u2019t what they use to make these decisions, it\u2019s faith. So logic just isn\u2019t really a mechanism that\u2019s used or even considered.
