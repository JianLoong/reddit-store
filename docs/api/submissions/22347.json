I don't understand what's so difficult here or why you're struggling. It seems like you're (unnecessarily) adding drama by being unaccepting.

I'm Muslim and the fact that you're so terse about her wanting to revert to Islam and her Muslim fiance shows that you not only handled things poorly, you don't care about your daughter at all.  Islam is a beautiful religion and the fact you're not even taking the time to learn some about Islam and firmly believing that she's going to Hell is not showing love to your daughter at all.  Love is learning about Islam, not necessarily reverting/converting, but learning about it.  Love is true acceptance of your daughter, her choices, and her fiance.  Love is not telling your own daughter she's going to Hell.  Telling someone you believe they're going to Hell is not any kind of way to show that you're trying to adjust.  Love is embracing a good, solid man into the family.  Love is being considerate of the Muslim religion and the company you were in to refrain from eating something that is not eaten in Islam (while we're on the subject, and even though it's only mentioned once, Leviticus 11:7 also tells you to not eat pork, and once is more than enough); I mean, would it really have hurt you to refrained from having pork that meal?\n\nActing cold and being unaccepting towards others is not what God teaches in either Islam or Catholicism.  Jesus said, \"Love one another as I have loved you and love your neighbour as yourself.\"  Islam has the same prophets as you, the same God as you. \n\nPlease find it within yourself to change your heart.  It is not your place to judge.  Only God is the Judge.", "YTA\n\nTell me if I'm wrong but from your comments I can see helplessness regarding your daughter's decision. Helplessness to understand and do and say what's right for her and yourself. \n\nHowever, if your faith makes it so easy for you to say that your own child will go to hell then it's your faith that's vile and poisonous and I'd seriously contemplate the beliefs that lead to such conclusion if I were you. You might not like it, might not like that your daughter doesn't share your faith and openly states her dislike but you chose the absolute worst thing to say to your child. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with what she says give her boundaries. That's the adult thing to do. Ask her to respect your faith but also respect hers and her choices. Educate yourself to understand her decision. Because no matter how faithful you are to Christianity what harm does it do to be tolerant and accepting and maybe even learn from other religions?
