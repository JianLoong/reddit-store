I'm Muslim and the fact that you're so terse about her wanting to revert to Islam and her Muslim fiance shows that you not only handled things poorly, you don't care about your daughter at all.  Islam is a beautiful religion and the fact you're not even taking the time to learn some about Islam and firmly believing that she's going to Hell is not showing love to your daughter at all.  Love is learning about Islam, not necessarily reverting/converting, but learning about it.  Love is true acceptance of your daughter, her choices, and her fiance.  Love is not telling your own daughter she's going to Hell.  Telling someone you believe they're going to Hell is not any kind of way to show that you're trying to adjust.  Love is embracing a good, solid man into the family.  Love is being considerate of the Muslim religion and the company you were in to refrain from eating something that is not eaten in Islam (while we're on the subject, and even though it's only mentioned once, Leviticus 11:7 also tells you to not eat pork, and once is more than enough); I mean, would it really have hurt you to refrained from having pork that meal?\n\nActing cold and being unaccepting towards others is not what God teaches in either Islam or Catholicism.  Jesus said, \"Love one another as I have loved you and love your neighbour as yourself.\"  Islam has the same prophets as you, the same God as you. \n\nPlease find it within yourself to change your heart.  It is not your place to judge.  Only God is the Judge.", "YTA\n\nTell me if I'm wrong but from your comments I can see helplessness regarding your daughter's decision. Helplessness to understand and do and say what's right for her and yourself. \n\nHowever, if your faith makes it so easy for you to say that your own child will go to hell then it's your faith that's vile and poisonous and I'd seriously contemplate the beliefs that lead to such conclusion if I were you. You might not like it, might not like that your daughter doesn't share your faith and openly states her dislike but you chose the absolute worst thing to say to your child. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with what she says give her boundaries. That's the adult thing to do. Ask her to respect your faith but also respect hers and her choices. Educate yourself to understand her decision. Because no matter how faithful you are to Christianity what harm does it do to be tolerant and accepting and maybe even learn from other religions?

My mom missed out on a lot of things, and I regret not reaching out to her. My husband was an amazing person. He would walk to the ends of the earth for me and gave me everything I ever wished for and more. We had 4 amazing kids together that my mother would have adored. Unfortunately, he passed away recently. Life is short. This will be a learning experience for everyone involved.  Try to take the time to understand her feelings. As a parent of 3 daughters, I know how it is to watch your child make decisions you might not agree with. As long as she is loved and taken care of, what more could a parent want? Family means everything to this religion/culture. Try to keep an open mind. You will always be her mother, and she will always need you.

There is no kind way to say that. \n\nIt\u2019s also a very stupid and petty belief. If there is a God he is bigger than the silly divisions that humans make. Churches are institutions. God is bigger than institutions. \n\nIslam is a branch of Judaism just like Christianity. Muslims believe in the Bible. They believe Jesus and Moses were prophets. They do not believe in the divinity of Christ and they have the Quran as an additional holy text. Some branches of Christianity believe that Christ, God, and the Holy Spirit are one entity, others believe they are three separate beings. These are essentially academic distinctions that have little to do with being a good Christian, Muslim, or person. \n\nThe God you believe in is omnipotent. Do you really believe that he is so petty to split hairs on minor details? Is she a good person? Does she help people? If there is a God judging her, he is judging her on that, not which particular group of worshipers she belongs to. \n\nMaybe you should reflect on your religious beliefs by reading some bible passages. Here are a few suggestions: \n\nMathew 7: 1-5,\nLuke 6: 37-42,\nJames 4: 11-12,\nRomans 2: 1-3.\n\nThey are all about not judging others in case that\u2019s not clear.

How can you not see how messed up that is? Enough with the \"I can't talk about my beliefs\" b.s. That argument doesn't hold any weight when you are talking about your own children. That's awful behavior. You wanna talk about eternal damnation? The fact that you believe you have the ability to judge people as God would is absolutely blasphemy. You are not God, you do not have the power to judge and condemn people. Truly, shame on you.

Until 1) she learned my mother was Catholic and 2) the wedding would be a big Catholic wedding at her church. \n\nMy grandmother was furious. Even though my mother is Christian!! She literally boycotted and refused to attend. That is, until my grandfather and her other children told her she\u2019d be home alone. So, she ended up coming.

Any other way isnt going to cut it. The core of Christian beliefs is that Jesus is the son of god. Islam doesn\u2019t teach that. In the eyes of a Christian that is a rejection of our god. Just because Jews and Muslim have some similarities in their faith, it doesn\u2019t make them brothers. Heck even Baptist don\u2019t think the Catholics are really believers because of all the idol worship and praying to the saints that they do.

You say you don\u2019t know but a believer knows. You have to remember that in the Christian religion you have to love god more than you do your own mother, daughter, son. Jesus spoke about how mothers will turn against daughters and fathers against sons over their belief in him. For the mother to say anything other than that would be encouraging her daughter to sin and in Christianity those who cause others to sin are worst off than the sinners. I also get that there\u2019s a time and place for everything and that certainly wasn\u2019t the time for it but if she was to lie to her daughter she would be going against her beliefs. It\u2019s easy for a non believer to say \u201c well you didn\u2019t have to tell her all of that\u201d just as it\u2019s easy for a a non vegan to tell a vegan to eat meat.

Yes there are distinctions in doctrine, but my point is compared to their faith in the same God and the basic tenets of all Abrahamic religions, those are trivial distinctions. \n\nYou are right that plenty of people think their version of Christianity is correct and that everyone else is wrong, but it is a stupid and petty belief like I said. \n\nI didn\u2019t call them brothers, The Pope did. According to Catholic doctrine he has a direct line to God. The Quran also explicitly says that good Christians and Jews will go to Heaven. The Bible says not to judge individuals. \n\nSo yeah, lots of people think those things but that belief is not supported by their own holy texts.", "Catholics don\u2019t worship idols.\n\nI think it\u2019s more productive to recognize the values of any faith that include respecting others, kindness, helping the less fortunate, etc.  Much less productive to insist that only our own beliefs are the correct ones.", "She asked, \u201chow would you have handled it?\u201d \nThat\u2019s how I answered.

When they pray to the saints to ask god for help instead of just asking god, that\u2019s a form of idol worship. But you are right when you say that it would be more productive to focus on the values of the faith rather than fighting over which is the correct faith. For example one can say he\u2019s a Christian but doesn\u2019t put his faith into practice where a Muslim may not be a Christian but puts his faith into practice.

What you describe sounds more generally Christian to me than specifically Catholic.

At the rate you are going,  you are going to end up being completely cut out of your daughter's life.", "they're all ignorant hypocrites, why argue?", "You\u2019re wrong about the idol worship but I agree with your points on focusing on the values we have in common.", "My main church wasn't that way either.
