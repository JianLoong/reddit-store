I was doing my second job and came home. Started cooking dinner and texted my wife to find out when she\u2019d be home.  No response.  I figure that\u2019s fine. She probably can\u2019t answer bc her hand is occupied. \n\nMy older son tells me that mom is at dinner with her friends  to sober up bc she got over served at the nail shop.  I check life 360 and see she\u2019s been at a Mexican restaurant for 2 hours and she still hasn\u2019t responding to me.  I also noticed that my younger son was at the mall(that was closing right about that time) so I text the family group chat and asked him if he needed a ride home.  My wife responds that he has a ride.  She never responded to my original question so I ask again in the group chat as well as ask her if she needs a ride home since i knew why was going on.  She did t respond until almost an hour later and said her friends were driving her and the car home. \n\n30 minutes later later she and the car come home but no friends.  I was furious because it\u2019s seems to me that she still has a buzz and drove home. She acts like everything is fine and I just told her, \u201cnow that I know you\u2019re home safely, I just need to be a way from you for a minute. \u201c I got in my car and drove off.  While I\u2019m driving she acknowledged that she drove home but was \u201cfine\u201d and then said that she loved me.  I just responded \u201cwhatever\u201d and spent the next 2 hours parked in a target parking lot and just reflecting on my reaction.   I know I was petty AITA in this situation?\n\n\nEdit for info/clarity:\nMy son was at the movies which is why he didn\u2019t respond and came home with his friends. She told me he would be with her before they left.  \n\nWe had made plans to eat together that night which is why I was cooking and wanted to know when she would be home so that everything would be ready on time or to put it off til later so it wouldn\u2019t be cold when she got home.  \n\n\nThanks for the input.  I think I should\u2019ve definitely not left and for sure not texted \u201cwhatever\u201d. I just needed to have some space. My dad was an alcoholic so I have trauma with alcohol.  Im not anti-alcohol, but I am concerned since her drinking has increased and we have talked about it in the past.  This is the first time she has driven after drinking since she usually has a dd or I come get her.\n\nUpdate: i wish I could give the \u201cexactly how many drinks\u201dquestion an answer but we haven\u2019t talked yet. I got home at 11 pm and she was asleep so we couldn\u2019t talk then.  It is now after 11 am the next day and she is still asleep.  I checked on her to make sure she was not ill, and she was snoring. I am sitting in the living room and my 2 high school aged children are at work.  I\u2019m hoping to talk with her when she wakes up and before the kids get home.\n\nUpdate 2: just talked with her.  She had 4-5 whisky drinks at the nail place.  She said they only had coke at dinner and she didn\u2019t see my texts.  Her friends were going to bring her home but they all agreed she was fine when she got to her car.  \n\nShe told me that o should trust her and she\u2019s hurt that I even was worried like that. I know I overreacted but something doesn\u2019t add up.  I\u2019ve known this woman for over 20 years.", "created_utc": 1673881996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dgzt1/aita_wife_possibly_drove_drunk/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cockpits were designed for an \"average\" pilot, where the average was found by measuring several hundred men along 11 or 12 dimensions in 1926, and finding the average for each of them. For decades, cockpits were designed to fit this average. But the air force kept having to deal with operator error causing crashes, and some suspected that it was the cockpit design.\n\nLong story short, someone measured several thousand men on 140 bodily dimensions like thumb length, crotch height, etc. The thought was that these improved measurements would result in a better cockpit. But one researcher thought otherwise:\n\n> He decided to find out. Using the size data he had gathered from 4,063 pilots, Daniels calculated the average of the 10 physical dimensions believed to be most relevant for design, including height, chest circumference and sleeve length. These formed the dimensions of the \u201caverage pilot,\u201d which Daniels generously defined as someone whose measurements were within the middle 30 per cent of the range of values for each dimension. So, for example, even though the precise average height from the data was five foot nine, he defined the height of the \u201caverage pilot\u201d as ranging from five-seven to five-11. Next, Daniels compared each individual pilot, one by one, to the average pilot.\n\n> Before he crunched his numbers, the consensus among his fellow air force researchers was that the vast majority of pilots would be within the average range on most dimensions. After all, these pilots had already been pre-selected because they appeared to be average sized. (If you were, say, six foot seven, you would never have been recruited in the first place.) The scientists also expected that a sizable number of pilots would be within the average range on all 10 dimensions. But even Daniels was stunned when he tabulated the actual number.\n\n> Zero.\n\n> Out of 4,063 pilots, not a single airman fit within the average range on all 10 dimensions. One pilot might have a longer-than-average arm length, but a shorter-than-average leg length. Another pilot might have a big chest but small hips. Even more astonishing, Daniels discovered that if you picked out just three of the ten dimensions of size \u2014 say, neck circumference, thigh circumference and wrist circumference \u2014 less than 3.5 per cent of pilots would be average sized on all three dimensions. Daniels\u2019s findings were clear and incontrovertible. There was no such thing as an average pilot. If you\u2019ve designed a cockpit to fit the average pilot, you\u2019ve actually designed it to fit no one.\n\n[When U.S. air force discovered the flaw of average](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html)", "That is really true.
