For fun. You fly to a different state at least once every month to sample different restaurants. And you are still financially secure after *all that*--You aren't middle class.", "NTA", "If you're going to be anonymous, just say the numbers.", "NTA, she just sounds like one of this people they like to bitch and loan all the time; because they have nothing better to talk about.\n\nI have a friend just like this, eventually if you tell them enough; they\u2019ll get the hint and just stop talking to you about it.", "NTA. Anyone that can live off of a trust is not middle class.", "I was raised pretty up there in terms of class, and I have no trust fund. Trust fund is usually for like\u2026 big money. \n\nHaving more expenses does not make you lower class", "My parents always defined it growing up is that if you would lose your housing if you stopped working.", "Depends where you live. $200k in many parts of CA is not a lot and you won\u2019t be living large in any way.", "In my area in 2018, $74k was considered the upper limit of low income if you were the sole provider for a family of 4.", "To show how out of touch the sil is: I get less than $2k a month and live on it. I'll admit it's not easy and I'm not going on any vacations but I survive.", "It really doesn't matter what \"class\" your BIL and SIL think they are. The truth is that they are living beyond their means, and that can be done at ANY price point. \n\nSo really, next time your SIL complains, point that out. It's not about \"class\", it's about having a budget", "No lie.  They aren't middle class.  They're just bad with money.  You can be a billionaire and be bad with money.  Just ask Elon.", "Believing she\u2019s middle class feels better than acknowledging they\u2019re fiscally irresponsible", "I'd argue that a trust fund that pays the mortgage on *any* home automatically removes you from the middle class.", "I get that. My parents recently retired after scrimping and saving themselves into financial comfort. When we were little, there were several years they didn\u2019t buy themselves any new shoes. But now they\u2019re in a position to comfortably care for themselves for the rest of their lives as long as they\u2019re somewhat prudent. My dad is still a total tightwad in so many ways, but he just bought a $30,000 Tundra. WITHOUT us having to bully him into replacing his unreliable truck. This man has never sold a car: he runs them into the ground and then he turns around and buys something else reliable but old, and he is replacing his running truck with the most expensive car he has ever purchased. \n\nSometimes I tell him I think he\u2019s been body snatched. But then he quibbles about throwing out freezer burnt bagels and fixes his shoes with duct tape and I know he\u2019s still my dad.", "It's not weird. It's called having your priorities in the right place. Save money where you can, and splurge on the truly enriching things like travel. Especially Europe! Have an amazing time!", "That\u2019s called priorities.", "My sister makes pretty good money and is single. She bought a $5,000 bike no sweat but then REFUSES to buy meat unless it\u2019s on a good enough deal. She also only had one bath towel for awhile and would be like, \u201cI can\u2019t shower til my laundry is dry.\u201d I looked at her and said, \u201cYou have money! Go buy another towel!\u201d I make fun of her lots for her \u201cspend nothing or spend thousands\u201d style.", "I feel you.  Me and hubs both come from families that struggled and our household income is now solid mid six figures.  A few weeks ago he came home from city hall, delighted, because he found out the city gives out free tampons.

In that different people prioritize different things. \n\nStuff that I like prioritize I have no problem spending money on, but other things lower on the list, I won't buy unless I can find a good deal on. \n\nLike clothes I buy \"cheap\" clothes and/or buy clothes that fit okay enough, shoes half a size too big if it's on sale/clearance etc.... \n\nBut beer/video games/restaurans I have no problem paying full price and/or going to fancy places. \n\nI have friends/family who rarely go out to eat, and usually when they do it's fast food. But spend hundreds/thousands on x/y hobby no problem. \n\nSpending money in different ways is fine, nothing wrong with it if you can afford it and it makes you happy.", "Depends on where you stay but you do need to know the local idiom for animal crackers.", "And I should clarify, the making fun of her is all in good fun.
