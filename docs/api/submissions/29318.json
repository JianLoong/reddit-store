They aren't middle class and your not an AH for pointing that out.\n\nFor reference, the middle class is defined to be from 2/3 of the median income to 2x the median income.  That's about $50K to $140K on average, but obviously higher in HCOL areas.\n\nI'm no trust fund baby; there was a time we got food stamps.  Now my wife and I each make over $100K and we have a hard time remembering that we are NOT middle class.", "Is unpaid leave to change careers a thing middle class people do?

She sounds jealous and resentful because maybe she's living under the illusion that you and your partner have a bigger trustfund?", "Going with NTA - folks with trust funds should not be complaining. That alone probably puts them in the top 5% of income earners.", "NTA I think you gave her a taste of reality. Many live beyond their means and that is a huge problem worldwide. Not sure she'll listen to your advice on spending priorities though.", "Yeah, they don't understand that \"living paycheck to paycheck\" has nothing to do with getting a fat paycheck every month and spending it all. Like yeah, if I made 100k every month and spent it all because I'm a queen of expensive lifestyle. Middle class, sure.\nYou're NTA. They sound insufferable.", "NTA - Sounds like she needed some perspective", "The real problem is that the term middle class has become meaningless because for decades people have pushed its bounds at the top and bottom ends.", "People who live a lie never respond well to the truth. NTA.", "NTA. She not middle class. Good luck trying to convince her though: it sounds like she\u2019s defined it as living paycheck to paycheck rather than as not having access to much money in the first place. It sounds like she\u2019s got an emotional investment in being salt of the earth and/or middle class as an identity thing. You\u2019ll never convince her logically, because identity is often more emotional than intellectual: she feels like she\u2019s middle class and views herself as middle class, so anyone who says otherwise *just doesn\u2019t get it*", "NTA - I think giving her a realistic perspective on what life is like for the majority of people, *especially* at the moment is something she really needs.\n\nImagine if she says this to someone who is actually struggling.", "NTA.

If there's someone poorer than you and someone richer than you, then people find a way to think they are middle class. \n\nThey're doing what the vast majority of humans do. Think that they are average. \n\nGood on you for recognizing your privilege. Just know that the worst way to change someone's mind is to point out how they are wrong with facts and examples. Counterintuitive at first, but we all do it. If we're told we're wrong, we immediately start coming up with reasons why we thought we were right in the first place.", "Some people just don't understand that \"I'm broke because I spent all of my money\" is **not** the same thing as not having money to begin with.\n\nNTA", "She did use 80% instead of 80th percentile in the first paragraph, so she was using the numbers wrong.\n\nEach percentile represents 1/100 of the total.  The first percentile would be the lowest, and the 99th percentile would be the highest in value.\n\nA percentile is the value at a particular rank. For example, if your score on a test is in the 95th percentile, a common interpretation is that only 5% of the scores were higher than yours.
