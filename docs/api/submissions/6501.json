Because I'm guessing that a lot of folks in the Midwest will disagree with me (longtime midwesterner) about this, and that might be where your friends are coming from. \n\nWe're a polite people, midwesterners. We do our neighbor's sidewalks and driveways without being asked. I've been the beneficiary of this more than once - I have a bad back and snow clearing is difficult - and I've done my best to repay with homebaked goods (acceptable midwestern currency). \n\nAs a result of this \"help your neighbor without being asked\" approach, entitled people who happen to reside in the midwest develop an even greater sense of entitlement because other people pick up their slack so frequently. \n\nBut the thing is, this midwestern politeness does ultimately rest on the notion that *we take care of each other.* We're used to people doing things for us, ON THE UNDERSTANDING that we'll do our best to repay it. (If you can't, you can't; you do what you can.) For example, I'll distribute baked goods when I have them, or pass out live plants from my garden. And it doesn't need to be direct \"payment\". If my neighbors did my driveway all winter and I helped the old folks across the street with their garden all summer, and we all know the old folks take care of their grandkids because their kids have full-time jobs -- I think everyone involved would feel like things were fair. It doesn't need to be 1:1, it's very much \"do what you can do.\" \n\nBut when entitled people like your upstairs folks arrive, the whole system gets thrown for a loop. We're so polite that most people not only won't *say* when something's wrong, they will get upset at *other* people for pointing out something is wrong (i.e. unequal). \n\nSo to me it seems like you've landed squarely in the space where midwestern community-mindedness collides with entitled behavior. \n\nI think you're handling this exactly the way it should be handled. The neighbors aren't adding anything to the community; they're not doing anything for anyone else. But a lot of midwesterners will be appalled that you called them out on this (because that is Not Done), and shocked that you weren't just \"nice\" enough to let them abuse your helpfulness. \n\nThese folks don't add to the community; they are only willing to take. As such, I wouldn't treat them as part of my community, which means they don't get their sidewalk shoveled and they don't get tomato plants or fresh baked bread. And that's how you need to explain it to midwesterners - not that they didn't pay, but that they *never* help, and they *don't* act like they're part of a community.

I dont mind returning a favour that costs me nothing in the long run.\n\nI also shovel snow for my senior neighbour immediately to the other side, even though we don't share a driveway, as well as for an elderly couple that could barely move. Again, I'm young and strong. The couple gave me a thank-you card once and I was so touched I never left their driveway with snow on it. They didnt have to give me the card, a simple wave of thanks would have sufficed, but gosh darn did they make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. They've both since passed and I still have that card. \n\nThe new neighbours, however, do not shovel my driveway. I've done theirs a few times, but they neither thank me nor return the favour, so I stopped concerning myself. No problem; no harm, no foul.

Kindness costs nothing and you kindly offered to pay to be kind; they refused your offer on the grounds that they could do it themselves, so let them do it themselves and forget your troubles. Hey, if they decide to be kind and do your driveway one day, that's lovely. Return the favour if you feel so inclined but, again, don't worry about it.

That's why.", "It was a better offer than half!  OP was willing to pay the entire cost.  All they needed to provide was their permission.  Which neighbors' withheld.", "What a gentle perspective and break down of the situation! Culture clash and community; never would I have thought about it like that nor put it in those words. If I ever get midwestern neighbours, I'll think of this.", "You should've told them about your asthma.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, your neighbours refused to let you help them and yourself. So you agreed to their terms, and they said they had their own shovels, so it's only fair that you both do your own halves.", "NTA. In what world do you owe them a thing? I'm unclear why you even offered to pay for a service for them. They are grown adults and should manage their own affairs. Weird this is even an issue.", "NTA... I have to do mine in pieces or I wont be able to walk. You have asthma, you need to keep it simple", "NTA - but for the sake of being neighborly, explaining about your asthma & the limitations it puts on you might help smooth out relations. Falling out with neighbors is a drag b/c they're always around!", "You don\u2019t owe them shit. And they fact they feel entitled enough to tell you that you do? F*** \u2018em.", "NTA. You offered something and they refused. Not your property not your problem.", "Didn't they say they have shovels??", "NTA \nIs he supposed to be a mind reader and just know they expected him to shovel out their driveway? What if they got upset if he did shovel their driveway? So ridiculous.", "I shovelled my neighbours shared driveway for 20 years until one day she called at 10pm and demanded I do it before I go to bed. I told her I\u2019ll never touch it again. I complained to a friend at a party and every snowfall my half was professionally shovelled. I asked him he said no idea who. Months went by and I dropped in and had a few drinks when his brother walked in and told me he overheard at the party months earlier and his petty ass stopped on his way home every snowfall with his plow and blower just because. Nta", "They didn't even have to share the expense.  OP said he would pay for the entire driveway to be cleared if they would agree to it, they just didn't believe in snow removal services, they had shovels and wanted to do it themselves, so thus op gave them what they wanted, to shovel themselves out.", "So he pays for the damages, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so different about someone else doing it vs him doing it", "Ohhhh wow. I missed that bit. \n\nHahahahahahaha. \n\nNeighbours are entitled a*******es biiiig time!", "Why should he do it? Do you work for free?", "Not sure how that\u2019s relevant, but maybe you misunderstood me. I was talking about how the neighbors don\u2019t want OP to hire someone else to clear the driveway", "Have you ever had someone plow your driveway? How do you talk on reddit?", "All I was saying is that if OP had a plowing truck it would be no different, if OP hired someone to do it then OP would pay for any possible damages. Hopefully you don\u2019t misunderstand that \ud83e\udd1e. Wait bidoof\u2019s law applies here, why am I even talking", "He shoveled the driveway. How do get to op plowing the driveway? Did you not understand the post?", "NTA. You need better friends. Also, just hire someone to do your half.", "Nta. Why should you shovel someone else's driveway?", "NTA\n\nI don't understand why you'd need their permission to hire a snow removal company if you pay for it anyways?", "The entitlement lol I would\u2019ve laughed in their face just kept walking", "Hard NTA. Their snow their problem", "NTA", "WTF did your neighbor seriously imply that shoveling twice the amount of space is barely any extra work?! Totally NTA!", "NTA. If they have an issue with you paying a snow removal service, then they should be okay with you not doing their side of the driveway.", "NTA. They fucked around and found out!", "Yes they did.  \ud83d\ude04\n\nPlus, to add, OP has asthma, and the last long-term study showed that almost 1,000 people die of snow shoveling heart attacks annually in the U.S.  Why stress himself when his neighbors said they would handle it?", "They also were quite clear that they didn't want someone else to clear the driveway.", "Yeah sadly that\u2019s how my FIL passed away back in November :(( he was a hardworking man who didn\u2019t know when to have breaks for myself. I think I almost got myself into the same boat too when I was shoveling a couple years back. Didn\u2019t even realize it until I stopped and felt my heart pumping fast. \n\nThat stuff can get to you if you\u2019re not careful in doing that. I was surprised to even read that OP shoveled despite being asthmatic!", "Did you read the post? The commenter is referencing the first paragraph, where OP mentioned hiring snow removal services (aka a snow plow), and the neighbors didn't want that.", "They\u2019re talking about OP hiring someone, not plowing it themself. Your entire argument to this commenter comes of extremely dense, so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just late and you misinterpreted the other commenter.", "What was my first reply? Have you ever had your driveway plowed?", "\u201cBut you said you have shovels\u2026.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAsk them if they'd pay for your hospital bills if you had an attack while doing the stuff they clearly were responsible to do themselves.\n\nYour landlord is an idiot for making it dependent on their agreement.", "NTA. They played themselves", "I don\u2019t understand why your neighbor feels entitled to complain that you didn\u2019t clear their part of the driveway. Unbelievably rude. NTA", "NTA. The level of entitlement is insane. Your friends can come and shovel the neighbors driveway", "Lol the balls on some people! NTA. F them.", "NTA. They said they have shovels, so they need to shovel away!", "NTA. Who are your friends? Entitled neighbors are one thing; I can't fathom why your friends think you, who (1) are asthmatic and (2) offered a solution that would have given them a cleared driveway that they chose to reject, should have any responsibility for their part of the driveway. If anything, they should be responsible for clearing your half of the driveway for you (since they won't agree to you being able to use a health-safe method)!\n\nIn fact, I have to wonder how the landlord can require you to have the upstairs neighbor's permission to hire a snow-clearing service. What if you have an asthma attack because your only allowed way to clear the driveway is through your own physical labor? Talk to the landlord and tell him about the neighbor's expectations. Tell him that he should consider updating both leases to state that the landlord will contract for a snow-clearing service and that both tenants will be responsible for half of that bill.\n\n(If that fails...) Entitled neighbors aside, can you hire a neighborhood person to shovel your half of the driveway so that you don't have to exert yourself physically?", "N T A", "What do you mean? They told OP they had their own shovel.", "Which is why I posted about the damage. If op hires a service to plow the driveway or does it himself, any damages will come out of op pocket. What shape is the driveway in? Is it concrete or asphalt? Is the driveway sealed?", "NTA.\n\n\nIf your \"friends\" feel so strongly about it, at least they know where your neighbors live and can do that job for them for free. \n\n\nIt's always very telling when a person will admonish you for not doing something will also baulk at the idea of actually doing that exact same thing.", "NTA. They're asking you to risk your health or your life to do them a favour.", "NTA\n\nWhy would anyone turn down free snow removal and then complain about not getting their snow removed?", "NTA & please hire a snow blower for your half of the driveway and your walkway. Don\u2019t mess with your health.", "Maybe it\u2019s because I live in south, but I just don\u2019t understand why they said no to a snow clearing service at no cost to them. What\u2019s the downside?", "You have a disability. You cannot be denied hiring a reasonable accommodation.", "NTA.", "NTA. OP, tell your friends they\u2019re welcome to shovel your neighbor\u2019s driveway!  You offered a solution your neighbors didn\u2019t want. Oh, well! Not your problem OP!", "Severe asthmatic here, NTA. So many people really don\u2019t understand how painful and exhausting it is not to be able to breathe. Idk where you are or the laws, but you might be able to get documentation about your asthma and needing to hire a snowplow as an accommodation. It might be worth checking out.", "The only reason they would have to complain, is if you piled the snow that you cleared on top of their snow-covered half. You did not.\n\n**NTA.**", "INFO: did you shovel snow onto their side?", "NTA", "In my favorite saying to circumstances such as this ... This looks like a you problem, not a me problem.", "I have the type of asthma where before I was medicated up to my eyeballs, going out in the cold would make my throat fill up with mucus to the point \u013awhere I felt like I was drowning. And I would have a hacking cough for a week. OP's friends are terrible", "NTA at all but please please please get a snow blower they are fun and easy to use and the best part is you can blow it all to their side just how the snow falls bwahahahaha \u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udf28", "Definitely move - the landlord put the power of help in your neighbors hands. And now you're given grief. They are terrible people. Nta", "FUCK THAT SHIT!\nShoveling snow sucks, nothing fun about it. Neighbor has HUGE BALLS getting mad at you.", "NTA. They refused for you to pay someone else to do it but wanted your own labor for free? That\u2019s just weird. I\u2019d have laughed in their face", "NTA. Hire someone to do your side only. Neighbors are on their own.", "NTA. You were right to remind them of the options you offered them and you have no obligation to shovel their side. You might share with them you have asthma and shoveling one side is all the risk you can take. Depending on timing could also have added that you needed to get to work. Think about going to the landlord and saying you have a medical issue and must have a snow removal service.", "NTA. I share a driveway with my neighbor and we each do our own sides. We often help each other out but it\u2019s not an expectation on either side. And, when my neighbor uses his snowblower to clear my driveway before I can get outside, he gets a six pack of beer.", "NTA. As they said, they have snow shovels. So now they can use them like they wanted to.", "NTA, the bare faced cheek of the neighbour. I\u2019d be embarrassed to call a neighbour out on MY laziness. Not OP\u2019s section, not their problem. Hire someone who will do your half, good luck \ud83d\ude09"]}
