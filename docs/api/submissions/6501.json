Sometimes when I\u2019m out shoveling I will go over and shovel everything I can. I don\u2019t though when the snow is heavy because it\u2019s too much to do it all.

If they do then yes you take your turn doing the whole thing AS LONG AS they are continuing to return the favor and do the whole driveway on their turn. If they don't however, you don't continue to shovel for them. You also don't confront anyone about it either or demand they shovel your path just because you're already doing yours.\n\nIn my municipality there is a by law about shoveling your walk in front of your house because people are really bad for not doing it (technically the front walk belongs to the city) and mail workers and citizens were getting hurt walking along the icy sidewalks that wouldn't be icy if the people living there weren't so damn lazy. So now you have 48hr after a snow fall to shovel your walk in front of the house or you get fined. And you're encouraged to help out you're elderly neighbors obviously and likewise elderly neighbors are encouraged to ask for help if they need it because not everyone knows their neighbors.", "What really gets me is that he offered to get someone to do the whole driveway at no cost to them.

I'm the sort of person who shovels the driveway to the very edges every time, even though it's twice as big as my small car. I also do my neighbours walkway on occasion because their snowplow guy doesn't do it when he shows up and the neighbours are nice to us. If I've got some time and energy left when I finish my whole driveway, I'll pop across the lawn and do theirs. I really don't mind shovelling most days, and the folks on either side are always super grateful, so I don't mind doing it.

No way. No how.

Buy a program and get you half of the driveway done. Neighbor can kick rocks", "NTA. Petty me would hire a service for my half only.

The neighbor's?  No way.  The neighborly thing was to offer to have a service come in and do the entire driveway at OP's own full expense - the exact thing OP offered.  Because they legitimately need the service for their own safety.  The neighbors responded that they \"have shovels\".  Well, now they can *use* them.\n\nOP taking the risk for their own side is one thing (and again, they shouldn't be) but for neighbors, especially neighbors like these?
