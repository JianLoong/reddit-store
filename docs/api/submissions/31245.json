I snapped that he needed to buy a pair of fucking headphones and stop fucking ruining movie night by playing his YouTube videos over the movie.\n\nMy dad got pissed and said that there was nothing wrong with him wanting to watch videos on YouTube. I told him that it was fucking rude to play them over the movie when the family was trying to bond and have a good time, and that I was tired of him ruining every movie night by not having the decency to just use a fucking pair of headphones.

If he doesn't want to participate in movie nights, why does he sit close enough that you can hear his phone and he can hear the movie? Who else is in the family and why are none of them saying anything about it?\n\nI would hate this too; I can't listen to two things at once. Your dad sounds like an asshole. I just don't understand why this is a thing.", "You're clearly the asshole here. Do you not understand who's house you're living in? He's probably watching some cool motorcycle video or something. He needs to hear that. YOu're probably watching some dumbass marvel movie or something. Apologize NOW. He's sad.", "YTA. As my stubborn dad used to say, \"when you get your own house, you can make the rules.\" Your dad is being inconsiderate for sure, but making brash demands that he change his behavior for your benefit is AHish.", "I don't think your an asshole here. Swearing wasn't the most ideal way of handling it, but in the moment emotions were high and you probably weren't thinking. You're dad isn't necessarily an asshole, but he could try to at least be understanding to your needs. An honest conversation is probably the best way to go about this.", "NTA. But in my experience, older men have a hard time coming to terms with hearing loss. I'm not excusing his behaviour because it definitely is inconsiderate, but that might be where it's coming from.", "ESH\n\nHe is being incredibly rude. No doubt.\n\n\u201cEvery single time, my dad will loudly play videos on his phone.\u201d His rudeness is a long-established pattern, but you and your family keep doing the same thing hoping it will somehow be different. Snapping at him the way you did was not the way.\n\nTry:\n- rotating the hosting of movie night\n- agreeing together that other devices are either turned off, on silent or used with headphones\n- buying him headphones (you could all pitch in - Christmas is coming up)\n- letting dad opt out of movie night altogether so he doesn\u2019t get a headache from \u2018the noise\u2019.", "NTA. \"My house my rules\" is a lame excuse to be a dick. I'm assuming you guys have more than one room, so why would he sit with you all, knowing you're having a family movie night, and play his videos on full blast? It sounds like he's either just an asshole, or maybe he feels left out and doesn't have enough emotional intelligence to express it. Do you think he feels excluded in some way and is acting out because of it? Is there any reason why your other family members haven't said anything?\n\n\nMy experience with people like this is that you kind of have to play into their ego to make them listen. I think you may need to sit down with him and tell him (calmly) that movie night is important to you and the rest of the family *and you really want him to spend time with you guys too*. Maybe try and get him to pick a movie so he feels more involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I absolutely hate loud noises and the fact that he said the movie was \"too loud\" would have pushed me over the edge.
