It's a 1 person job. I have attended parties with children who have both parents but it's a rarity unless it's a family member.\n\nIn fact, at this house, we fight to be \"not it\" when it comes to attending parties. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIs it possible Dad has a little bit of social anxiety and didn't want to be there alone having to talk with other parents that he may not know very well? That's not your problem, that is definitely something a grown adult will have to handle on their own, a lot of us go to therapy or read books to learn better social skills since social anxiety is something a lot of us struggle with. There are books you can read, and therapists who can talk to who can help you navigate the challenges of social anxiety, and if that's his issue, it's something he will have to do like the rest of us.\n\nIf he wanted you there to parent the child, instead of him, too bad, he's a dad, He can handle being a dad for an afternoon at a party on his own.\n\nThere's really no need for two people to be there, so whatever his other reason is, whether it's social anxiety, or he wants you to do the parenting instead of him, whatever it is, He needs to focus on developing those skills so he doesn't need your assistance.", "NTA. I've never seen both parents take a kid to a birthday party unless all the parents are friends as well and they are going to gang put together. If this is just a random classmate there is no need for both parents to go.", "NTA \n\nIf a parent is invited/encouraged to stay, we usually just have one go. We take in turns who goes depending on who feels up to it and what type of party it is. \n\nAlso made it easier when we have multiple kids, one attends, the other is home with the other kids.", "NTA. \n\nIm in the uk and apart from my child\u2019s own birthday party I\u2019ve always taken her to other parties alone. \n\nTbh most parents drop their kids off and leave them. Maybe he wanted to bring you along so everyone could see he has a new partner or something?", "NTA. U.S. here but usually just 1 parent if it's a school friend or day care friend. If it's a friend of the family or relatives then both since everyone knows each other.", "NTA, to answer your question, usually just one parent attends with their child in my area (in the Midwest, US). Most families have other kids that need to be watched or one partner will take time for themself. I thought we were all in agreement that attending birthday parties with your kid is miserable and we would want to spare our partner of this! \n\nWith that said, you may need to have some larger conversations around expectations of your involvement in your husband\u2019s child\u2019s life. Even as the most engaged step parent, this feels like a clear scenario where it would be a given that you would get to spend some time on your own and he would step into his parenting role. \n\nAlso agree with other commenters who mentioned there may be more to this for your husband (i.e. social anxiety) that might put a different lens on the situation.", "NAH How old is the son? My nursery aged boy has been to multiple parties over the last year where I have been the only parent to come alone. It is a little weird as you have no one to chat to! My older two I rarely stay but when I do there is still a mixture of one or two parents per invited child to all types of parties! I am in the UK too.", "NTA. My God, why on earth should both adults waste a weekend day on a kid's birthday party? Not to mention it's more expense for the hosts. Your husband is being ridiculous.", "NTA, he just wants you to share in his pain because these parties are hell on earth.", "NTA. Both parents typically don\u2019t go and there often isn\u2019t enough space or food to accommodate both parents. If it\u2019s a situation where they\u2019re good friends with the family/parents, then sometimes both will. \n\nIs this his son\u2019s first party ever? Or is it that his ex-wife has typically handled party duty and he didn\u2019t want to do it himself?", "Why not drop the child and go do errands?", "Nta. Usually my husband and I both go because we enjoy hanging out with the other parents, but he's taking our daughter to a birthday party today by himself cause I'm working.", "A tiny bit the AH. He probably felt a little awkward being the dad in a room full of couples and mums with young kids. Many people would possibly call it creepy for a man to be hanging around unless a single dad. It may not have necessary for his son but is was necessary for him to have your support. I can see both sides but don't consider exercise a \"chore\" you do instead of being a supportive step mother and wife", "Nah as a parent usually only one parent goes and stays. Unless you\u2019re family or friends with the couple.", "Nope, we take it in turns with ours. Who wants twice the number of adults at your kids' party, than the number of kids invited. I have never been to a birthday party where both the parents/partner stayed.", "NTA A child's birthday is not a couples event. Unless all those kids got plus ones. If parents are being encouraged to attend it's because the host is anxious about having that many kids without back up. Or it's doubling as a social engagement for the adults. But that's usually something that happens with close friend groups that happen to include a lot of families with children. I feel like you would've mentioned if the adults there were all close friends with you and the SO. If it's just some random kid from your Step son's class then there's no reason for more than one parent to be there. Moms do it all the time. His ex probably does it. He needs to learn to suck it up. It's part of parenting.", ">I offered to come and be with him but he declined. He is upset with me for not initially agreeing to come. \n\nYou gave him the opportunity to attend together and he declined. He is no longer justified in being mad. NTA. Not UK, but birthday parties are generally attended by just one parent.", "I miss the days where you held a birthday party, kids were dropped off then picked up at the end\n\nI get the norm these days are to attend, which is awkward if you work full time and don\u2019t know any of the other parents who have bonded during drop off/pick up times \n\nESH that he wanted you both to go, he\u2019d have a feeling he\u2019d be hanging by himself and wanted company \n\nI\u2019m in Australia", "NTA\n\nIt does not need to adults to take a child to a party and wait for them. I am pretty sure many Mums(and Dads) manage quite fine on their own.", "NTA I never had kids parents stay at my kids party\u2019s they always just dropped them off.", "NAH. \n\nIt can be one parent, both parents and in some cases where specified no parents. There's no wrong or right answer. Me and hubby typically both go if we are both free but we have no issues going alone if that's the way it's gotta be", "NTA my husband never attended parties ever, one if sufficient. Sounds like dad doesn't want to bother parenting his own child and wants you to be on hand for that.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but you didn\u2019t do anything right. Your husband just wanted to spend time with you. That\u2019s the issue. HE wanted you there with him just so he could be with you, and he\u2019s sad you said no.", "I mean\u2026he probably just wanted to go with you. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH for asking. He shouldn\u2019t get upset though. Do you normally spend time together as a trio? You, your stepson, and husband. Also why did you say no before? And what made you change your mind? Honestly ESH", "YTA. It could have been a family growth situation that you missed out on. In a year when you are posting about how you feel like the outsider between this dad and his son I hope you remember this post. Part of being in a family is showing up when you really rather not. This could have went a long way to show your stepson that you care and are involved in his life. Remember this when he tells his friends that \"she is just my dads wife\".
