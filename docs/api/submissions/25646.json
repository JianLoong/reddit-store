What happens if two animals need expensive work done in a few years?\nForget about being able to save for a wedding, how are you ever going to save enough to buy a house?  Lord knows you won\u2019t be able to rent a place with that many animals if you ever have to move.", "Thanks for the opinion. In my original post, I laid out the details and stated that the trip is possible but will push us back a bit. We're not endebted with the exception of the student loans, thankfully. We have pet insurance for any unforseen visits and should hopefully not need it... Bases are covered, but 5k is too much for a trip for us.", "NTA.  When you plan a destination wedding, you have to understand that not everyone will want to participate.  They're already married! Not sure why you're giving up your honeymoon suite at your wedding.  The gift is enough.", "What the heck do they get the honeymoon suite at YOUR wedding?!", "NAH but are you ok if they don't show up to yours?", "I'm not going to a destination wedding unless my hotel , flights and food are paid for me", "NTA.  In my opinion, destination weddings are an economic imposition on the guests, which is just plain rude.  In fact, that is the intent of some weddings.  My niece had a destination wedding specifically so that certain relatives would not attend (because they would not be able to afford it).", "NTA. You are just being financially responsible", "For 2-3k you could spend 1-2 weeks at an all inclusive resort in Cancun. Outrageous prices for a wedding lol.\u2014NTA", "NTA - destination weddings are for when the couple doesn\u2019t want everyone there. If you truly were on the must attend list, they\u2019d have a regional location or cover your cost\u2026.", "Basically they want you to go on a very expensive vacation with them and making sure they're the center of attention.  They are already married and this isn't a 'real' wedding.  Why WOULD you go?  NTAH.", "The whole point of a destination wedding is that no one will show up.", "NTA and I\u2019m glad you found a workaround. Dealing with debt and not overflowing with money can make it really difficult to do things with loved ones.", "You should not have to go if you can't afford it, but there are plenty of people who go to their family members' celebrations without their partner. So what if you get a vacation and he doesn't? It's not really about what is \"fair\". It's a vacation with a purpose. He can do something later on.\n\nIf you're fine with missing it, then you're fine with missing it. Just make sure you don't regret it in the future.\n\nFocus on your own wedding.", "NTA I think if people truly believe you attending the wedding was the highest priority, they should provide you with the tickets and hotel to allow for you to get there. You shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice you\u2019re important life goals for one night.", "I really hate it when people say that if you really want to be there, you'll find a way.\n\nSince I haven't started counterfeiting money yet, no, I can't find a way.  The mortgage still needs to be paid.  The bills need to be paid.  The family needs to eat.  The only way I can 'find a way' is to not do those things.\n\nNo one's wedding is that important to me.\n\nIf you really want people to be at your wedding, don't make it so expensive.", "NTA\n\nThat's the thing with destination weddings. Not everyone can afford to come.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks that you can't go but if you can't afford to pay a huge amount to attend this, then you can't afford to. Simple as that. If they desperately want you there, they need to foot the bill.", "He\u2019s nta for not wanting to attend but there is no way in hell it costs 2 people 3k to fly to the Caribbean from the eastern us", "Yeah I read that and went wtf? Cause OP does not owe his brother anything esp if it's basically just a destination party since they're already married. OP is allowing his brother to treat him AND his future wife like shit.", "Yes. This is the weirdest concession to make. What on earth? Why would he even ask that?", "I really hope OP sees this, because that update is gross. They'll be a huge AH if they give up their suite at their OWN wedding to their brother, an AH to themselves!", "yeah, I did not understand that AT ALL.", "If they have to board multiple dogs it could easily be in that ballpark. Plus, depending on the flight times, you might have to drop the dogs off the day before you leave and pick them up the day after you return. Most boarding facilities have specific hours for drop-off and pick-up. The place we use is something like 7 or 8 am to 6 pm. And it's more limited on the weekends. We have a big dog and it's $92/day to board him. So say you have 2 or 3 dogs for 4-6 days? Gets expensive fast.", "I can certainly understand them wanting it, but not demanding this level of financial outlay from their guests.", "I will never understand the whole concept of destination weddings. \ud83e\udd37", "It seems very self absorbed. Especially the way that many of them are really designed to give the bride and groom a cheap wedding at the expense of their guests.", "If your vrother really wanted you there he shouldn\u2019t have picked a place so expensive and in another country. Its should be a rule that if one decide to do a destination wedding then the bride and groom should know not everyone have the means to attend. And please, you don\u2019t owe anything to your brother. Dont take those 3k to give him as a gift, that\u2019s kinda a lot. Save it for your life foals and if your brother cares he will understand", "NTA. But if he's already married, I see no reason that you have to give him a  monetary gift.  That's ridiculous.", "Just to play devil's advocate, did you call the resort and ask them how much it would be for the room without telling them you were with the wedding party? Some resorts have higher rates for those blocks of rooms so they can cover the honeymoon suite for free. It might be cheaper to book outside \"the block\".", "NTA - y\u2019all should not be giving up your honeymoon suite at your own wedding!!! That\u2019s insane!", "NTA!\n\nRather greedy of them wanting to get married twice and expecting you two to go into debt for it.\n\nPS - nice updates to read!", "No one is ever the asshole for not attending a destination wedding. It\u2019s extra insane that they\u2019re already married and trying to do a destination wedding-style celebration. NTA, if you\u2019re on the need to attend list then he\u2019s the need to pay for all of your attendance list.", "This. My husband and I had a destination wedding.... Precisely so that we didn't have to offend anyone by not inviting them (big families, big drama) but could still have a small party/low number of attendees. We literally didn't care who came, other than our parents and grandparents, who we paid for to come.", "Slightly further down OP has clarified that they have a separate, private lodge booked for themselves \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162vn3t/comment/jy0bw62/\n\nWhich makes more sense cos I was confused by this at first too!", "The cost for animals is completely believable. For my dogs, it\u2019s $40 a night and if they need medicine that\u2019s extra, for my anxious dog that can\u2019t interact with a large number of dogs it\u2019s extra for her to have more one one on time etc. I live in the Midwest so costs are nearly what they are like on the coasts. Airfare is halal expensive.", ">My brother has put me specifically on a \"need to attend\" list and has stated that \"If people want to be there for our wedding they will find a way\".\n\nWTH?!, that's pure manipulative bullshit.\n\nNTA, having a destination wedding means not everyone can attend, your brother and his wife are assholes for trying to force to spend a small fortune just to be there for 3 days.", "NTA\n\nWhen it comes to destination weddings, they can either pay for the people they absolutely \"need\" to be there or not complain when people can't afford to go.", "NTA\u2026. Butttt, why are you providing your brother and his wife the honey moon suite at your own wedding?! Please don\u2019t be a push over.", "NTA\n\nYou want your guests to attend your destination wedding? Then you should pay the extra expenses for your guests."]}
