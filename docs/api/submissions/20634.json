The women in this thread commenting that it\u2019s a red flag know, likely from personal experience like I do, that a partner controlling what they wear is the first step toward trying to control other aspects of their lives. It starts with subtle digs at clothing choices and escalates to \u201cyour sister is biased against me, you shouldn\u2019t hang out with her.\u201d And then to \u201cI\u2019m taking away your debit card.\u201d  \n\nAgain, you\u2019re cool with your partner picking your clothes maybe because they know and care more about fashion than you do. That\u2019s completely different than OPs situation where she says I\u2019m becoming confident in my body and my bf doesn\u2019t like it and wants me to run my outfits by him because he\u2019s bothered.", "Just some reasoning of why some women will not be ok with anyone trying to dictate them while it might not bother men in the same way:\n\nIf you take a look though history women are constantly being repressed and dictated, never being in charge of their own. Even to this day we get a lot of shit from different angles of people still trying to decide for us. I live in a super advanced country when it comes to gender equality and female rights, and even here it annoys the shit out of me. \n\nIt is more than just compromise for a lot of women, it is us finally trying to just be ourselves the way we want for the first time. And having people try to fuck with that freedom does not make us happy. \n\nBut again I bet you a lot of women and men will be ok with compromising on how they dress for their partner, but that does not mean everyone has to be ok with it. And that is their right.", "Do happy healthy couples/spouses really dictate only 1 person has to change what they wear? And call that compromise? Yeah no. Why date someone if you hate them showing off skin & assume the worst?"]}
