Dad won't see the bruises mom might.

Your 17 year old daughter was pregnant and you never had a significant enough conversation with her at the time to realize how she felt and that your wife was pressuring her? You have been married for this long and you were unaware your wife had strong religious beliefs? Were you even around?

No wonder your daughter doesn't take any responsibility for her choices. She learned it from you. And your still doing it. When you have the opportunity to own up to your part and maybe build a bridge before you pass you are helping make the riff worse. Your all assholes. Your daughter has a mind and doesn't seem to have problem with confrontation now, so I doubt your wife coerced her into having 3 more kids with her husband. And as well as you seem to get along now, if you had been involved I find it hard to believe she wouldn't have told you in the beginning instead of several years later?? Your wife obviously worried more about appearances than your kids feelings and should have offered support no matter the choice. And your TAH because you still aren't admitting to your fault in all this. Where were you?
