Dad won't see the bruises mom might.

Your 17 year old daughter was pregnant and you never had a significant enough conversation with her at the time to realize how she felt and that your wife was pressuring her? You have been married for this long and you were unaware your wife had strong religious beliefs? Were you even around?

No wonder your daughter doesn't take any responsibility for her choices. She learned it from you. And your still doing it. When you have the opportunity to own up to your part and maybe build a bridge before you pass you are helping make the riff worse. Your all assholes. Your daughter has a mind and doesn't seem to have problem with confrontation now, so I doubt your wife coerced her into having 3 more kids with her husband. And as well as you seem to get along now, if you had been involved I find it hard to believe she wouldn't have told you in the beginning instead of several years later?? Your wife obviously worried more about appearances than your kids feelings and should have offered support no matter the choice. And your TAH because you still aren't admitting to your fault in all this. Where were you?

I would also be taking a good long hard look at myself and wondering why I was so absent in my daughter\u2019s life and that I had no idea she was being abused by my wife and son in law. \n\nI understand that you are dying, so prioritise the people that are most precious to you. So go on holiday.", "NTA, but your wife is. \n\nShe completely betrayed your daughter, and she is reaping what she\u2019s sowed. \n\nGo on the trip. Spend time with your kids. \n\nLeave your narcissistic wife at home. \nBecause she\u2019s literally making this trip about her, not you, the person who actually has cancer. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your diagnosis.", "[removed]", "Nta. This trip is about you, not Debra. She lied to you for years. When you were in the service and found out one of your fellow officers lied, endangering the enlisted people, what would you do? She made your daughter\u2019s life miserable and covered it up. In the end, you were willfully blind to her excesses, so you bear some of the blame. \nConfront your wife. What have you got to lose? Not to be mean, but the cancer will get you before she does\nNta in this situation, but YTA for not protecting your daughter\u2026.really, you could have investigated her marriage a little deeper and found all this out much earlier.", "Yeah I\u2019m confused about why he\u2019s still with this woman who forced her own daughter into an abusive marriage.

THEN when the daughter goes to her mother about her abuse she\u2019s shut down and told to basically \u201ctough it out\u201d, THEN when daughter finally leaves the abuse mom is distraught. So yea. I would take my kids side a million times. Just because that\u2019s my wife doesn\u2019t make her right.

Somehow you've skirted any consequences for being so absent from your child's life that all this happened and you had no idea?\n\nYou *are* sending mixed messages here.

Everyone has shared responsibility and needs to communicate. You picked a job you wanted to do to support your family. That's awesome. I'm sorry you were left out of the loop by the kids, they have responsibility too. I totally understand the wife situation too, I've personally heard and seen this exact same story a thousand times. However that was then and this is now. From a former hospice nurse - it's the past, it happened, you can't change it but you can do everything you want and need to do in the present. Cherish your children. Love them. Tell your wife all the things that burden and pain you. You'll never get another chance to. It's YOUR end of life, and it's all about what YOU want, and how YOU want to go out. If you see this message at all .. let it go, you can't go back, you can only move forward with what you have now.

Like I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not saying anything new that OP doesn\u2019t realize himself. You\u2019re acting like he was absent by choice he was working, some people have to work difficult hours just to live and becoming navy pilot is absolutely difficult so the fact he was able to do that is major, Just give your judgment."]}
