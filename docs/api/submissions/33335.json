A few weeks ago I got a letter from a lawyer saying I am given a house and some money (low six figure USD) in my mom\u2019s stead.\n\nWhen my dad passed when I was 15, my mom and I moved. We managed to buy smallest house in a nice neighborhood. Our next door neighbor was Ella (now 62) who lived alone. She was divorced and her two children lived several hours away. \n\nElla and my mom were fast friends and they worked in the same building until Ella\u2019s retirement (different companies). I knew they hung out often though I was usually busy with my own things. I was often playing the errand girl dropping and picking things up between our houses. Ella\u2019s children visited every new year and they were cordial with us.\n\nI got a scholarship for university overseas and since then didn\u2019t visit much. I learned that Ella\u2019s health was bad and she was often in and out of the hospital.\n\nI took a break from grad school and visited my mom in November. She got into a car accident a week after I went back. She clung to life for several days before leaving me forever. I am still grieving even as I have to settle all her affairs. I\u2019m her only relative so naturally I inherited all she had. I also learned Ella passed a few days before my mom in the hospital.\n\nElla\u2019s lawyer reached out to me, saying Ella left the house she lived in and money for my mom in her will. Her children got her other properties and more money. Because my mom passed, as her next of kin, I am to inherit Ella\u2019s house and money.\n\nElla\u2019s children reached out to me. They said though I have the right to the inheritance, I should relinquish because I am almost nothing to Ella. They are OK with my mom receiving the inheritance because she has been an active part in Ella\u2019s life. They said it\u2019s greedy of me if I decide to take the inheritance.\n\nI think back of all the nice things my mom did for Ella over the years. Ella would want my mom to live a comfortable life and I\u2019m sure my mom would want that money allotted for her to help take care of me. Still, I wonder if I\u2019m AH for receiving the inheritance intended for my mom just because I\u2019m next of kin with no special connection to Ella herself", "created_utc": 1702982741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lz2d8/aita_for_receiving_an_inheritance_given_to_my_mom/", "score": 274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am truly sorry for your loss and also their loss, however Ella wanted your mom to have it. And therefore, you would have inherited it anyways down the line.

Your mother had a good heart and was friends with Ella.

Ella's family are being greedy.

If there is anything in the house that holds sentimental value for her children, it would be nice of you to offer that to them, but otherwise you are all in the clear here. Yes, it was meant for your mom - but it would eventually have been passed on to you anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add; my sincerest condolences for your loss. I can't imagine how devastated you must be.", "NTA. If your mum hadn't passed you would have got that money anyway.", "NTA it\u2019s your inheritance because it\u2019s your moms", "NTA, you likely came up a lot in their conversation. Take the inheritance.", "I am sorry for your loss. I hope you are doing well in these circumstances.\n\nYou received an inheritance from your mother. This is completely legal. The inheritance is yours only as no part of it is legally for the children of Ella to have. If you mother were alive the same thing would happen. This money would never go to the children of Ella (they are being manipulative and showing their greed).\n\nNTA", "Ella children are being vultures and greedy. they know you will be mentally weak while you are still grieving for your mom, and now is easy for them to guilt trip you and harass you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou keep the inheritance.", "NTA.  This is highly personal business", "NTA. It is quite a big thing that Ella left the house to your mother. She had her reasons not to give it to her children. She specifically chose for that. \n\nYou inherit in your mothers place. It is as simple as that and there is nothing greedy about it.", "NTA.\nFirstly, sincere condolences for your loss. Can\u2019t even begin to imagine what you\u2019re going through, and then having this weigh on your mind.\nElla\u2019s kids, if they took a step back, would realise they\u2019re not being reasonable. Ella\u2019s kids, as you say, got her other properties. They\u2019ve been more than catered for.\nElla\u2019s wish was to include your Mum as a beneficiary, and that absolutely means that you, as her only child, also de facto benefits, regardless of whether tragically it happened sooner than she might have envisioned.\nElla\u2019s wishes for her estate to be so divided, are not in alignment with her kids\u2019 perspective. Legally, ethically and morally, the estate of your Mother\u2019s is now yours, and that includes what she was left by Ella.\nBest wishes to you. I hope you are able to put the inheritance to good use and change your life and future in doing so.", "NTA. If it was ok for it to go to your mom, it would've gone to you regardless at some point. Why then do they care about timing?\n\nIt's legally yours and that's what matters. You have a legal and moral right to your mother's estate as her sole heir.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Ella wanted your mother to have what she needed and a little more. \n\nWhat your mother wanted most was to make sure you were going to be okay and be there for you as you grew up. Your mother can\u2019t do that now, but she has an inheritance to leave you instead, as a cushion against life\u2019s little mistakes. \n\nThis is sad, but the money is being used for your mother\u2019s wishes. Which is what Ella wanted.", "we're they expecting your mother to give them back the inheritance when she passed? it would have always gone to you as the next of kin. seems the only ones being greedy are Ella's kids", "If Ella wanted her kids to have money she would have changed her will. Don\u2019t you give those kids a thing", "NTA\n\nElla left your mother a legacy. That property became your mother's when she passed.\n\nyour mother sadly passed a few days later and everything she owned including her neighbour's gift became yours.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to retain a lawyer, though, and direct all future communication from Ella\u2019s family through the lawyer.\n\nElla gave your mom and you a gift. She knew that you would end up benefitting from it as your mom\u2019s heir and she did it anyway, so she clearly had no problem with you ending up with the house and money. She obviously hoped it would be much farther in the future, but she was aware that you would eventually inherit.", "NTA. Take the money. You don't know what life will be. That's a gift. They have much more money so they won't live in poverty. \n\nI don't know how to say it in english so...\n\nJe vous pr\u00e9sente toutes mes condol\u00e9ances pour la perte que vous venez de subir. J'esp\u00e8re que votre m\u00e8re veille sur vous l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle se trouve et que vous trouverez la paix.", "Ella, in her mind, already intended to give that to your mom op, so while legally it had been Ella's till she had passed, I'm sure ella would also understand that when she had passed, reasonably, that your mother would more than likely give her assets to you. So i think it's not like ella probaly didn't think about this outcome.", "There should be no ground for legal challenge. Ella died first then OP's mom. People often die together and the law is equipped to handle things like which will takes precedence, so Ella dying days before OP's mom is much clearer."]}
