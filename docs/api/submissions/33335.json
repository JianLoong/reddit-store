I learned that Ella\u2019s health was bad and she was often in and out of the hospital.\n\nI took a break from grad school and visited my mom in November. She got into a car accident a week after I went back. She clung to life for several days before leaving me forever. I am still grieving even as I have to settle all her affairs.

They said it\u2019s greedy of me if I decide to take the inheritance.\n\nI think back of all the nice things my mom did for Ella over the years. Ella would want my mom to live a comfortable life and I\u2019m sure my mom would want that money allotted for her to help take care of me.

And legally, you're in the clear. \n\nMorally, though... Ella wanted to make sure your *mom* had a place to live and money to live on. Not you, your mom. She put that wish above providing for her own children, but that may have been because she thought your mom needed it more than her kids did. It doesn't seem like you were a factor in her decision.

If not, then YTA.", "NAH. Sounds like a tough time for everyone. They have the right to ask, and you have the right to refuse, but I think the charitable thing to do would be to split it.", "Well... technically... it did go to your mom, for a week. \nSorry to put it so bluntly.  My condolences for your loss. \n\nFor me personally,  it would depend on wether I would need it. \nIf you are in a comfortable place in your life,  and you can do without it, it would be nice of you to leave it for Ella's children. If it makes the difference between struggling,  and having a comfortable life, would keep it,  and maybe start a college fund for Ella's grandchildren,  should she have them.\nOr rent out the house, and put it in your will that it can return to Ella's family in the end. \n\nBut you know... It's all legally yours. You can do with it as you please. \nThey'll call you greedy. But remember they too are probably grieving.", "I'm going to go with YTA/NAH.  The kids were right; that money was meant to be left to your mother, not for you.  Like you said, you two did not really have a relationship.  I'm guessing the will would have been amended if Ella had more time.\n\nThat being said, I most likely wouldnt give it back either.", "You're NTA. Talk to a lawyer and see what you can do.

Your mothers were best friends and im sure they are together right now.", "Don\u2019t give Ella\u2019s children a damn thing. Elle left them them to your mom and now it is yours.

There was a huge estate contest tired to them and a long court process to determine which one of a married couple survived the longest.\n\nIn the US, lawyers can extend the time period for survivorship. Most don\u2019t. They leave it as the default 48 unless clients ask.\n\nI do know some lawyers who put in 7 days. Almost no one does 30 days because it slows down the estate administration process. \n\nThis is a popular belief bc of tv shows and media, but it isn\u2019t reality on the ground. \n\nAlso, the whole point of having a survivorship. Is because of the whole Tylenol debacle, and determining who died first it\u2019s not some race to the finish line where people have to live a certain amount beyond to inherit.\n\nNow, there are provisions you can put in about people having to attain a certain age before they get handed things outright. The movies typically get those wrong as well. I was just watching a TV show last night where the inheritance was split between a wife and a nephew nephew had to survive until 21 to take outright. the show tried to make it that if he died before 21 the wife got it back that would be highly unusual and almost would-because the nephew share would go to someone else upon his death, either by terms of the trust, or will, or by his own estate.\n\nThe survivorship period is that pop culture and general population get really wrong", "I would argue they're already being unreasonable.

I wish you nothing but goodwill and healing.\n\nRegarding your post, I actually do think yes, YTA.  Of course you are legally protected if you claim the inheritance - this is a purely moral judgement.\n\nIt does not sound like you had a close relationship with Ella.  That's completely fine - she was your mom's friend, you didn't owe her love or a friendship.  But were it not for your mom, you would not likely have been considered in Ella's will.  If I'm right, it is likely that if she were still alive, Ella would have rewritten her will after your mom's tragic death.  As it actually is however, your legal windfall is due to coincidental timing - not an intentional bequeathal.\n\nSome have pointed out that had your mom lived a full lifespan, you would have naturally inherited her estate when she eventually died decades down the line, and no one would blink twice about that including what she inherited from Ella.  But that is a much different situation than what we have today, even in a legal sense (decades of asset commingling is not an issue here).  Mom would have benefited from her very intentional inheritance for the rest of her life first, before you received what was left.  THAT was Ella's hope, not how things actually transpired.\n\nI also don't think the children could have really waited and raised their objection later, when your own grief wasn't so raw.  It was Ella's lawyer who started the ball rolling here (as was their duty).  If the children hadn't spoken up when they did, it may have had legal implications, and also would have been much more difficult for you to give them what was theirs even if you were willing.  I chalk it up to exceptionally horrid timing, which I'm sure everyone would agree is the case here.\n\nIf you keep the inheritance, by no means are you a villain.  And you do have the legal right to do so.  But ultimately, I think you need to ask yourself honestly what Ella would want, if your mom had died before she updated her will.

Her kids however will never admit to that because what they want is money. If they truly cared about their mother they would\u2019ve tried to see her at minimum more than once a year. It just goes to show how detached they were from her. Regardless though, you have every legal right to this money as well as moral considering your history with Ella. If I were you I\u2019d block her children\u2019s numbers, social media, etc. & go meet with an attorney. There\u2019s a change they\u2019ll try to challenge the will, it more likely than not will end up in your favor. You still need a lawyer though. They weren\u2019t disinherited, and Ella didn\u2019t have diminished mental capacity so their case is small. That is unless your state has a death clause/period for the inheritor to live past. Either way you need a lawyer.\n\nYou need them to walk you through the possibilities step by step, tell you what they can or can\u2019t do, and if you hire them then they will deal with any correspondence with Ella\u2019s kids so you don\u2019t have to. They\u2019re also not likely to change you hourly and may just ask for a small percentage of any cash you inherit.  I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty if I were you, you have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. That they were fine with it going to your mom but not her child upon her death is a them problem and has nothing to do with you. That\u2019s their opinion, not Ella\u2019s, and definitely not the right one from where I\u2019m standing. So please see a lawyer, cut contact, and release whatever it is you\u2019re holding onto and get their words out of your head. They\u2019re biased as all hell, no matter the circumstances they\u2019re never going to admit that you have a moral claim to it, that you should have it, that there\u2019s nothing wrong with keeping it, or that their mother would want you to have it because it goes against their personal interests. Don\u2019t take a word they say a moral final say, it\u2019s a biased opinion with a lot to gain by convincing you of it.", "NTA - Sounds like they had no special connection with Ella either.", "NTA, they got a bunch too, you just \u201clucked\u201d into it through a series of unfortunate events. If your mom lived there 10 years before passing and directly inherited it to you, would they care? They likely would have never known. \n\nSo keep the house and the money and at least make something of what is given to you.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve done (and are continue to do) nothing wrong.\n\nElla wanted to pass something to your mom, well aware that it would likely go to you when your mom passed.\n\nThat the timing sounds tragically close in timing, there is no way to know if your mom passed first that Ella would have changed her will to exclude you.\n\nDon\u2019t be defensive.  Be grateful and make an annual (once a year regardless of month/day) to visit their graves with a heart full of gratitude for the roles they played in your life.", "NTA.\n\nDeath brings out the worst in people, I stg. Look at it this way though. Ella wanted your mum to receive that inheritance, and your mum wanted you to receive everything she had. It\u2019s a simple chain, and going against it would be disrespecting both Ella\u2019s and your mother\u2019s wishes. So you take that inheritance and you enjoy it - it\u2019s what they both would have wanted.", "Nta and you should have a lawyer draft a cease and decist so those people don't contact you anymore\nIf Ella gave it to her friend I imagine she understood that said friend could do as they please, and that meant giving it to their kid. It's rightfully yours because it was your mother's, it's not Ella's.", "Nta by the the inheritance  is your keep it live the life your mother would want for you", "NTA. Ella's left that for your mom knowing it would be passed to your moms heirs. Its yours.", "Ella's children got \"her other properties and more money\". It sounds like they are doing ok and Ella wanted to thank your mom for being such a good friend. I bet she would not have minded you inheriting  the money meant for your mother. NTA. Enjoy your inheritence.", "NTA.", "NTA", "You are 1000% NTA  Ella's will gave the property to your mom and your mom to you. The fact that i was a few days or decades does not matter. It is unkind that her children would pressure you to give up what is rightfully yours.", "NTA. Take the money. You are entitled to inherit your mother\u2019s estate. Ella\u2019s greedy kids can fuck clean off.", "NTA. It would be one thing if her children had been left with nothing, but as you point out, they are well taken care of already. Ella intended for this particular inheritance to pass out of the family -she was aware of that when she left these things to your mother- and so you should not feel obligated to give it back.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA- Ella & your mum are hanging out again right now. Your mum said all the mum things about you still being her baby and her wanting to be able to look after you even though your all grown up and educated. Ella smiles kindly at your mum and says much as she was hoping not to see her here so soon, it turns out she left her daughter a larger nest egg than she thought and a guarantee that you'll never be without a place to live whatever happens. Your mother relaxes a bit and Ella feels great that she's been able to help her good friend, who looked after her, look after her daughter after she's gone.", "Is this a Mom/Ella love story where they cherished each other so much that they couldn't be on the earth without the other? Then one of each of their children fall in love with each other during the settlement of this estate, so in the end they officially become the family that they didn't feel society would have allowed when the two of them were together? Then there's a conversation about masking and acceptance and how it changes over the generations and the hope for the next generation.\n\nYeah I'd watch that movie.", "NTA. You\u2019re not an ah for keeping the inheritance because who\u2019s to say after Ella passed your mom wouldn\u2019t have shared with you anyways. She might have given you Ella\u2019s house since she has one and money for you. Ella knowingly gifted these to your mother knowing she would/could potentially gift/share with you. She cared enough about your mother to know this.\n\nI would definitely hire a lawyer to mediate all this for you and have the lawyer handle contact with relatives and if the lawyer thinks it would be good to offer them all of Ella\u2019s sentimental and personal possessions in the house like photos, jewelry, clothings, or things that can be passed down.\n\nMy condolences for your mother and hopefully this doesn\u2019t stress you out during your time of grieving.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but when you leave money or a house to someone you leave it not knowing how long they will live for. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a big decision. It\u2019s not like hey you can get my stuff but only if you live a long healthy life. You give it unknowingly, unless otherwise stated. If the mom had passed a year from now or 10 it would still go to OP. It just so happened that tragedy struck and this is how it played out. And who\u2019s to say OP\u2019s mom wouldn\u2019t have just gifted to her anyways. Once the mom had possession maybe should would have given the house to OP since mom has a place. So that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s reasonable for OP is keep the inheritance. Seems like Ella took care of the other relatives and set this aside for OP\u2019s mom and whatever mom decided to do.", "Exactly. All these N T A responses are absurd. If you were the kids in this scenario, you'd be just as annoyed. Friend of the mom? Fair. Kids of the friend of the mom? What??", "Ella's kids are assholes. They just lost their mother and they're more concerned about inheritance than anything else. They're trying to get OP to give up what is rightfully theirs because they're greedy.", "\"Almost no one does 30 days because it slows down the estate administration process.\"  \n\n\n\\---I am a lawyer as well. In my state (in the U.S.) 30 to 60 days is very typical. It doesn't really slow anything down. No normal estate is ready to be distributed within two months. The time period for creditors to make claims is a lot longer.", "Put yourself in their shoes. You'd be pissed too.", "OP didn't even know her. They're her kids. The kids should have it not a stranger.", "As we've seen on Reddit, some people go nuts when money is involved.", "Right! It's interesting that they called OP greedy for keeping what is lawfully hers. Aren't they also being greedy for asking to keep her portion when they have already received a fair inheritance?", ">Another lawyer here that handles decedent estates and also was a probate court clerk. In my state (in the U.S.) 30 to 60 days is very typical. It doesn't really slow anything down. No normal estate is not ready to be distributed within two months anyway. The time period for creditors to make claims is a lot longer, so by the time that comes around, it is long known if a beneficiary died in the time period.", ">She didn't do that, which means she was fine with it going to whoever OP's mother chose to leave it to\n\nNo it doesn't. We don't know why she didn't do it, probably didn't even think about that possibility.", "I think I'd not go after a grieving daughter. I can't even imagine being so entitled", ">It is the right thing to do.\n\nThat isn't what Ella wanted.", "Greed for the kids to want the inheritance versus a stranger that never knew her?!", "If the mom had lived, the money would have been passed on to op, not reverted back to the kids on her death. The only thing that's changed here is the timing. Not the person's wishes.", "And that's the crux of the matter her kids do have most of it!", "It also seems like the house is their mom's primary residence, so it would confer much more sentimental meaning to them than some rental properties.", "The required survival time varies widely, and there is no minimum. In my state, the second to die has to survive the first by 120 hours to be regarded as \"surviving,\" but the will or trust can change that period.", "I second this.", "One of my brothers had that in his will so that if they both died, the money was less likely to go to our estranged SIL, although I was to give her a share if she and my other brother had reconciled.\n\nedited for clarity", "makes sense."]}
