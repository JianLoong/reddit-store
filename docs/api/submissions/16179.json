For context, I am throwing my brother a graduation BBQ at the house we rent together. He worked hard to earn his undergraduate degree and I want to celebrate him. \n\nI told him to invite any of his friends and girlfriend and am planning to invite family and a few of our mutual friends. Today, he told me that his gf requests we make the BBQ a non-alcoholic event, as his gf is uncomfortable around alcohol (she\u2019s never drank before due to anxiety issues). \n\nI responded that there will be non-alcoholic and alcoholic options for anyone\u2019s preferences. I firmly believe that if an event I\u2019m planning is at my house, I shouldn\u2019t have to tell a group of people not to do something in order to make one person happy.

I would say NAH. It's both of your house so the decisions should be mutual. \n\nBut then again, the party is for him so it should be the way he wants.. maybe consider having a no-alcohol party to make him happy? \n\nGirlfriend might get judgement and resentment from family members if they can't drink alcohol in her presence... That's something she needs to work on", "While I personally think the girlfriend is being overly fragile, it IS a party FOR YOUR BROTHER. In any other situation, you would not be the AH, and the girlfriend is going to have a rough time in life if she can\u2019t be around anyone drinking, ever. But since it\u2019s a party in your brother\u2019s honor, you ought to honor his request. And tell him next time there will be alcohol whether she\u2019s there or not. YTA (slightly)", "NTA. Your brothers girlfriend will have to work out her issue with alcohol with a therapist. Is she going to request this of everyone at any event she\u2019s invited to?!? It\u2019s unrealistic to expect every party or any event she goes to to be alcohol free.", "YTA if the party is for him and he asked for this (even for his girlfriend) then there is no question that you shouldn\u2019t have alcohol there. If not having alcohol would \u201cruin the BBQ\u201d then consider if alcohol has too much a role in your life. You can celebrate without it.", "NTA.  If she's uncomfortable she doesn't have to go.  I'm a sober alcoholic and would never dream of asking something like this.  The selfishness is absurd", "NTA\u2026How does she go to restaurants? They serve alcohol\u2026", "NTA. I think she has nerve even asking such a thing. If she has a problem with people partaking of alcohol, she should stay home.", "NTA - it\u2019s not a party for her and it\u2019s obnoxious to expect everyone to obey what she wants for no reason.", "NTA. If she was a recovering alcoholic/addict, it would be a different story. But she\u2019s the only one responsible for managing her own anxiety about what other adults are consuming.", "I'm a little torn on this one. I am leaning towards NAH because while you have the best intentions for everyone invited to have a good time, it's to celebrate his achievements and his wishes should be taken into consideration. If it's his party and he insists while you argue it makes Y T A.\n\nHowever, if anything the Brother and brother's GF need to learn that she doesn't need to drink but she can't expect to stop others from drinking every time there is a social event or celebration in life. (It's a little different if it's your own celebration but this stood out to me). It's perfectly fine to visit bars or parties where alcohol is being consumed. You just politely refuse and stick to your non-alcoholic beverages. There are far more tee-total people around than people think, especially for medical reasons like anxiety, medication etc... so she isn't alone. If the being around alcohol causes anxiety however she should see someone about that as it will cause huge problems in the future.", "Her anxiety is her problem. Inflicting it on others is incredibly rude. NTA", "NTA you are hosting the party. You\u2019re footing the bill. You have both alcohol and non alcoholic beverages available. I think it\u2019s rude of his girlfriend to ask alcohol not be served at an event that is neither at her home nor is she hosting.", "Does she also want a vegan BBQ? Where do you draw the line when accommodating people that are not family.", "NTA! Supporting people with mental illness is important... but they should expect their own triggers to be everyone's problem. The BBQ is for your brother not her.", "NTA It's your house your rules. If you want both alcoholic and nonalcoholic options have them. If gf doesn't like it she doesn't have to attend.", "YTA. The BBQ is a graduation party for your brother, right? So prioritize making his gf comfortable so it'll be a better party *for him* over your general belief", "YTA. The party is for your brother and he wants to accommodate someone important to him. What if her anxiety is due to growing up with alcoholics in her family?\n\nDoesn\u2019t he also live at that house?\n\nIf you and other guests can\u2019t have one event without alcohol that\u2019s a big red flag about your behavior and habits.\n\nIt\u2019s one day (part of one day). Accommodate them. Do you have to have alcohol on Christmas morning or Easter Sunday or Flag Day?", "It's a celebration for him. By definition you should be trying to make it enjoyable for him.", "YTA, \n\nThe party is to celebrate his achievements. You may be the host but his preference of having no alcohol is reasonable. And you rent the house together. \n\nPlus this is to make the guest of honor as well as his girlfriend happy and comfortable. Surely family and friends will understand that.", "YTA. It\u2019s his celebration. I think this is fair.", "YTA. The BBQ is to celebrate your brother. I imagine he wants his girlfriend there as well. If the idea of having one event without alcohol is so inconceivable to you I\u2019m incline to say his gf is right to feel anxious about attending.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t throwing your own bbq\u2026 you are throwing one for your brother. As a congratulatory celebration. The least you can do is make him and his girlfriend comfortable.", "> I firmly believe that if an event I\u2019m planning is at my house, I **shouldn\u2019t have to tell a group of people not to do something** in order to make one person happy.\n\nSo, the GF doesn't just want you to not serve alcohol, she wants you to tell your guests that they are not allowed to bring any? Not bring beer to a barbeque?\n\nNAH, but she does sound a bit of a princess, doesn't she?\n\nIf she doesn't want to drink, that's fine. If your brother doesn't want to serve alcohol, that's fine. If they want you to tell your guests they are not allow to bring beer to a barbecue, take them out to dinner.", "NAH.\n\nTalk to your brother about what would happen if other guests brought alcohol to the party.  I see this happen a lot and you need to have a plan beforehand.\n\nI would have non alcoholic drinks galore.  Maybe you could have a dirty soda/juice/water bar?  Look up a drinks place called Swig and browse their menu for ideas.  You could lean into the concept for one party.", "YTA. The party is for your brother. Most normal people firmly believe that a party is for the guest of honor, not the host.

When you throw someone a party you generally accommodate their preferences not your own.", "NTA..she\u2019s a gf not a wife, she could be the ex gf the next day and you did a party non alcohol only for her..", "YTA\n\nYou're correct, EXCEPT if you're planning an event to celebrate/honor someone else.  If that's the case, the guest of honor's wishes for the party override all else because the party literally is about one person.  You can't \"celebrate\" a person by throwing them a party they hate or aren't comfortable with.  That's just an imposition dressed up in party clothes.  You should either throw your brother the sort of BBQ he wants or not throw him a BBQ at all if this is a dealbreaker for you as a host.  \n\nThis is your brother's party to celebrate your brother's accomplishments.  If he wants that party to be non-alcoholic, then it should be.  And everyone should respect *his* choices for *his* party.  They can drink elsewhere.", "YTA. The party is for HIM and you rent the house TOGETHER so your points are extremely invalid.", "Soft YTA because it's his party so it should be however he wants, but she should stop making her problem everyone else's problem.\n\nI'm probably an AH, but I would just serve soda and have a flask for anyone you feel can be respectful and low-key about it. What she doesn't know won't hurt her.", "If it was a normal BBQ I'd say N t a, but it's literally for your brother and this is his request. YTA", "Don\u2019t serve alcohol but be sure to let people know. I know that I would be annoyed that I couldn\u2019t have a glass of wine with dinner but less so if I was told upfront. How does she handle going to restaurants? Sporting events?", "YTA because the party is for your brother.\nTake a personal inventory and consider why it is absolutely necessary to have alcohol.", "NTA she can have her own \"better\" party.", "No alcohol at a BBQ? I don't know man.. I know it's a party for the brother and it's his gf making the request but... No beer? At a BBQ? I'd probably cancel the party and plan like bowling on something. Beer and BBQ is like Pb&j.", "ESH except the brother. OP is throwing the party for brother and he won't be happy without his gf there, so OP sucks for not agreeing to brother's request. Gf needs to learn her anxiety about drinking doesn't get to influence other people's choice to drink so she sucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We would just be accommodating her request", "Look. I drink, but good lord people have to learn how to be around each other and have fun sober. No idea why anxiety that keeps you sober needs to be worked on but the social anxiety that causes people to need to drink at all events is fine?", "Idk, if Im going to a BBQ with adults,  I dont want to feel like im at 10 year olds birthday party.", "Sober alcoholic as well.  One of the first things I told myself when I quit drinking was that it's my problem and no one else's so don't make it someone else's problem.  To ask people not to drink is ludicrous.", "Ok, gonna say this - maybe she has/had an alcoholic parent or family member that was inappropriate or abusive in some way.  Wouldn't a scenario like that give you some kind of anxiety?  Empathy my friend.", "I agree. If she were an alcoholic, I could understand.

It\u2019s your brother\u2019s party, so the goal is to make him not look like too much an asshole. \n1. Throw a kegger, you\u2019re 100% TA. \n2. Have a secret flask party. Let all your friends know about it except her. See who can get the drunkest without letting on they are actually drinking. \n3. Multiphase the party. No alcohol early on, have a buddy who \u201cdidn\u2019t get the memo\u201d show up later in the night with booze in a cooler. \n4. Just have everyone drop some acid?\n5. Peyote sweat lodge party?", "I agree.  Also a drinker, but I would never expect alcohol at every adult-sponsored event.  Whether it's a child's birthday party or even an adult event.  If I've been invited, I'm cool with whatever.", "I never said that it's fine for people to drink because of anxiety.. but that wasn't part of the post.\n\nI don't drink btw", "That's quite the jump.

I am also responsible for managing my own anxiety when in similar situations.", "Just off the top of my head, family members being abusive drunks could easily cause this type of trauma. This isn't exactly undocumented behavior lol", "There's no indication that this is the case, but I could see someone who grew up with a violent alcoholic parent having some pretty legitimate anxiety around alcohol consumption.

Where can you get enough acid for a whole party?", "Finally some voices of reason! I\u2019ve seen way too many posts where the main issue isn\u2019t how people can\u2019t seem to be sober at a social gathering but instead getting mad at the ones throwing the party.

Like too many of us don't know what to do with our hands without holding a glass lol. So we do a lot of fun mocktails and seltzers and make your own Italian sodas. Carbonated juices are another favorite. So much of drinking culture is that we all just learned and socialized around alcohol and assumed it was necessary. Now we are getting old and know our awkwardness better and also know we all should probably be hydrating more than we do - so this is a win win.", "A party at his home in his honor.", "I agree but my days of following the dead around are long gone."]}
