In any other situation, you would not be the AH, and the girlfriend is going to have a rough time in life if she can\u2019t be around anyone drinking, ever.

She\u2019s a gf today, so it\u2019s really your brother\u2019s circus and monkey but will that circus continue if their relationship does? I would personally just ask him how he feels and how he sees this progressing. If he wants to take care of this request of hers by eliminating the alcohol, that should be his decision, but any comments from attendees need to be addressed to him. Also how does he plan to approach get together in the future? If gf is uncomfortable, will he stop attending gatherings that have alcohol? If not, her adapting now would be better than a more formal gathering. \n\nIf he honestly does not care, then does he want to take his gf preferences over his friends and family?

And than the girlfriend to be vegan an expecting OP to host a vegan bbq because meat makes her uncomfortable. I think based on the available info the girlfriend (and potentially the boyfriend depending on how that went) is the ass here. she needs to accept that other people will make other choices and she should respect those choices like she expects others to respect hers instead of trying to control those other people.
