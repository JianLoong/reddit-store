She\u2019s a gf today, so it\u2019s really your brother\u2019s circus and monkey but will that circus continue if their relationship does? I would personally just ask him how he feels and how he sees this progressing. If he wants to take care of this request of hers by eliminating the alcohol, that should be his decision, but any comments from attendees need to be addressed to him. Also how does he plan to approach get together in the future? If gf is uncomfortable, will he stop attending gatherings that have alcohol? If not, her adapting now would be better than a more formal gathering. \n\nIf he honestly does not care, then does he want to take his gf preferences over his friends and family?

And than the girlfriend to be vegan an expecting OP to host a vegan bbq because meat makes her uncomfortable. I think based on the available info the girlfriend (and potentially the boyfriend depending on how that went) is the ass here. she needs to accept that other people will make other choices and she should respect those choices like she expects others to respect hers instead of trying to control those other people.

It's not that I won't have fun, but to me the perfect setting involves coke zero. To my dad his coke zero is beer. Not because he is an alcoholic (he is not, let's be clear) or because he won't enjoy it without. He likes the taste, he likes the way it makes him feel, and to him it's the perfect combination with the BBQ.

Is it the only way people have fun? Absolutely not, but most people like alcohol, and prefer to go to social functions where they have alcohol. Not everyone is a closeted alcoholic if they aren't happy a party won't have alcohol. I'd be pretty bummed if they didn't have coke zero.", "Because one allows someone their choice and the other is trying to stop everyone else have their choice. \n\nIf it was a non alcoholic party and one person was trying to change it to be alcoholic they\u2019d be just as much of an asshole. \n\nPeople are allowed to drink to cope with their anxiety if they want.\n\n*\u201cMy anxiety makes it so I like to have a drink or two at a party\u201d* is a far cry from *\u201cmy anxiety makes it so **YOU** are not allowed to drink at a party\u201d*", "Boy, this response is refreshing.\n\n I've been sober 6 years. I honestly don't care if alcohol is served where I am. I'm comfortable and secure in my sobriety, and I just don't like to hang out for hours at social events anyway. \n\nBut I read posts on Reddit about people who don't want alcohol at their weddings and everyone - and I mean *everyone* - is condemning them. Pretty much saying that no one is ever going to want to come to a wedding when there's no alcohol there.", "One thing about healing trauma, though, is realizing and fully embracing the idea that others aren\u2019t responsible for our reactions. Just because we have trauma responses to things doesn\u2019t mean that other people in the world need to change their behavior to cater to us. \n\nI agree that this particular situation should probably result in a dry barbecue because the guest of honor requested it, but in other situations, his girlfriend\u2019s problems with being around alcohol in general don\u2019t lie with anyone else. She needs to be able to manage those feelings and responses herself, or choose not to attend events where she will be triggered. Nobody needs to bend over backward for her, and if she wants to be included in her partner\u2019s family\u2019s social events, it sounds like this is a hurdle she needs to start working on in therapy. Not because alcohol should be ubiquitous, not because she\u2019s wrong for having trauma, but because the unfair and terrible experiences she had can\u2019t dictate other people\u2019s lives, and the reality is that those who don\u2019t share her trauma want to have a beer at a barbecue. It sucks for her, but it\u2019s reality.", ">isnt overly fragile\n\nI have PTSD from a series of events a number of years ago. I have a very specific trigger that I know to avoid. I AM a fragile person, and the sooner folks with trauma realize that they are fragile, the better.", "OP's brother can plan his own party and not serve alcohol.  A party is about hosting multiple guests, which OP seems to understand.  If it's that important to the brother, brother can pay for and host his own party", "How is that anyone else\u2019s problem? Yeah I\u2019d feel bad but I\u2019ve got issues with my own personal life, I deal with them and move on.", "Lol. Not attend the party thats supposed to be to celebrate him?! \n\nThen its just a party.\n\nBy all means do that, but you blew the reason for it.", "yea it\u2019s this, she can stay sober all she wants but she can\u2019t force a whole group of people not to do something because she gets anxiety from it, she definitely needs to work on that, what happens when she goes out to a restaurant? is the table two down from her making her anxious from the glass of wine they have? NTA.", "Seriously. The core issue is that one side wants to dictate what others do at a party based on their anxiety.\n\nPeople who might drink from social anxiety (which, as you said, is still a stretch and we can\u2019t assume that\u2019s their reason) aren\u2019t telling others that they must drink.", "As a recovering alcoholic, i beg to differ. People will force you to drink - even if you explain that you\u2019ve had a problem. \n\nI\u2019ve had to leave a 2 year olds birthday party because an adult spiked my drink.", "And I think one of the points some commenters are missing is that what happens at the next event, will the girlfriend demand that there's no alcohol served there too.", "Yeah. It should be up to him", "yeah, honestly op, you need to actually sit down with your brother and talk with him - it's *for him,* not you.\nand tbh brother is kind of the ah for trying to put this off onto you. I see several likely scenarios here:\n1. he's worried about your response and actually wants to accomodate gf, but is putting the responsibility(/blame, if you or guests are upset) entirely on her. 2. he wants to avoid blame from gf if she's upset about alcohol at the party, so he's making you the bad guy. 3. he is avoiding making a decision and and is putting you in the middle of issues that should be addressed internally wrt his relationship with his gf. 4. he just doesnt care that much and knows one of you will prob be upset, but wants to make you decide bc he'd rather \"avoid the drama\" (ie he doesnt want to actually deal with the effort of maintaining relationships with people and their pesky emotions)\n\nnone of these could be true! several of them could be! we just don't know from op's account, and op won't either unless he sits down and has a real conversation with his brother", "If 5 is happening, I want in", " But the party is supposed to be for his brother. If OP only cares about what OP wants (which seems likely given that there is no indication he ever asked his brother what his preferences were) OP shouldn\u2019t say the party is in honor of his brother.", "This. I lived with a mean verbally abusive drunk for 8 years and to this day I still face some internal anxieties. But on the flip side I just suck it up to prevent scenarios like the OP\u2019s and get a nice coke or seltzer water with a lime.", "He may care whether or not she attends.\n\nIf so, he needs to let OP know what his choice is", "I don\u2019t think he would do that if he didn\u2019t want to honor that, unless in the context of asking for advice which he clearly didn\u2019t do.", "Nonsense, OP wanting to let people to decide whether or not to have a drink at their BBQ party does not mean anyone has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.\n\nPeople work hard, they're entitled to enjoy themselves as they see fit during their free time. Why does one person take priority over everyone else? I don't like drinking due to the fact both of my parents are alcoholics and have been my entire life. That doesn't mean I'm going to be a judgemental asshole and throw a little hissy fit just because others and to have a couple beers with their food.", "You don\u2019t understand the problem. It\u2019s not that they always have to drink at an event. It\u2019s that there\u2019s one person trying to dictate what everyone else does.", "Yes, they are. There's definitely a whole bunch of drinkers out there that take it very personally when someone in their group isn't drinking, and pressure the fuck out of them to change their minds. And if that's not anxiety/insecurity talking, you tell me what it is!\n\nAnd besides that wasn't the argument anyway. The argument they were making was that people who like to drink alcohol often pressure other people to serve it at their parties, and that's seen as acceptable. And it shouldn't be that way. It's an unreasonable reaction because you shouldn't ever need alcohol so bad that you can't go one party without it - that's being a crutch not enjoying the taste.\n\nAnd it's true. Would you say that someone who doesn't serve Coca-Cola products is being an asshole to you? Or that no party is worth going to if it doesn't have lemonade? Or that if someone doesn't serve sweet tea, you'll sneak it in in a flask and that will show them that you can't be controlled? No? So why is it socially acceptable to pressure and insult people who don't serve alcohol at parties?", "I don't know their reason for drinking, but many drinkers don't like when others aren't.", "Spiking your drink is a crime, full stop. We aren\u2019t discussing that but a standard party in which someone chooses their own beverage.", "If I\u2019m throwing a party at my house I\u2019m going to be drinking, so alcohol will be there. She should throw her own party at her own house. Problem solved.", "I foresee a ton of problems with brother's girlfriend and the family in the future.", "Having to have alcohol isn't the same as wanting to have alcohol", "The thing is you\u2019re getting past the main issue of the post to rant about alcohol culture. And even if your feelings about alcohol are valid, I think it\u2019s unfair to look at the OP\u2019s post and extrapolate it to other drinkers you\u2019ve met throughout your life. It\u2019s better to stick to the basic facts.\n\nI think the people who are saying that OP should give this to his brother because the party is a celebration for him have the right idea. But the GF is pretty audacious in this request and OP feelings of resistance are a natural response. I wonder what she plans to do for the rest of her life around alcohol.", "Those people exist but are irrelevant to the post since there\u2019s no indication that\u2019s an issue. So it\u2019s still one person requesting to control all the others.", "The argument being made is that NO ONE FORCES anyone to drink. \n\nI begged to differ. \n\nThis is not a one time thing. Also try reporting that to small town RCMP because I was told that since I just spit it out & left, there was no harm done, it was just a prank & I shouldn\u2019t waste their time.", "So many of my friends have stopped drinking in the past few years, and it's fun to go to parties and see the fun non-alcoholic drinks we all make. There's an Asian market around the corner from me, so I usually get a bunch of Japanese sodas when I have people come by. They like the flavors and pressing the glass ball into the bottle.", "Following that through, so would it be the brother at his gf's place for a party, and then OP is hosting a graduation party in his honor without him being there? Is this party about the brother, or is this about having an excuse to drink?", "!!! \n\nI also don\u2019t know how as the host you couldn\u2019t be completely insulted or hurt from hearing that people would refuse to go to your wedding if there wasn\u2019t booze.

I'm explaining the point someone else was making about AITA's habit of villifying people who don't serve alcohol.", "This *is* about alcohol culture, whether you want to acknowledge it or not.\n\nHaving to serve alcohol everywhere all the time when a  group meets for any reason is exactly alcohol culture.", "You're comparing her to drinkers. You made them relevant", "Again, force is a crime. I\u2019m sorry that you have horrific friends and/or family. As an adult child of an alcoholic, my experience is vastly different than yours. I\u2019ve never been forced. My advice, get better friends and dump the ones that you think are your friends. They aren\u2019t.", "Okay but my point is that this post is about a non-drinker trying to control an aspect of a party they aren\u2019t throwing or that isn\u2019t for them.

Force is a criminal action whether or not there\u2019s a conviction. Continuing to associate with those that would force said action speaks volumes about you. Please seek counseling and one can receive counseling online. If you feel the need to associate with those horrific people, bring your own canned beverages to guarantee safety and maintain visual contact at all times. Personal responsibility dictates you take self care seriously and quit blaming small town, access to alcohol at parties, or other. As an adult child of an alcoholic, Ive heard all the excuses.
