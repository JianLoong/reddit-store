Heat and or bleach don't kill all of these things.\n\nFor instance, C diff is a bacteria that lives in your gut. It is almost impossible to kill this with bleach, because it reproduces by spores which survive bleaching.  It's like killing all the fleas, but not killing any of the eggs. A week later you got fleas again.  If you are exposed to C diff from the outside, you get violently ill and people routinely die from it. \n\nAlso, a lot of the microbes can't be killed with bleach or hot water or soap, so you guys are just asking for violent GI issues.

Personally I use disposable gloves for cleaning the toilet and also don't reach into toilets filled with poo... but if you clean and disinfect the RUBBER gloves before using them again, I don't get the bacterial issue here.\n\nEdit to add: if sex toys can be cleaned, so can rubber kitchen gloves.
