I found it weird (and a little offensive) that she was basically saying that my hands are generally gross enough to contaminate the stuff that had been washed, but she was hurt that I didn\u2019t understand it was important to her to think that the plates and things are properly clean.\n\nI\u2019ve no problem with washing my hands before making food etc, but this seemed unnecessarily fastidious and something it had never occurred to me to do before.

She\u2019s not telling you that your hands, personally, are grosser than anyone else\u2019s. Presumably she\u2019d want anyone putting away the clean dishes to do so with freshly washed hands. It\u2019s just a reasonable precaution to keep everyone healthier. Because people eat off the dishes. \n\nYou took it personally and that wasn\u2019t necessary. You should probably consider whether you need to work on any underlying insecurities that made you take offense.\n\nEvery person should ideally also be washing their hands for a full 20 seconds with soap and water whenever coming home from public (where you\u2019ve e.g. touched communal doorknobs), after using the bathroom and after any activity that involves touching one\u2019s own or another human\u2019s orifices.\n\nETA: it doesn\u2019t matter whether hand washing before putting away clean dishes is a common expectation in other people\u2019s homes, rather it\u2019s just about your partner having an easy-to-accommodate and politely communicated preference that doesn\u2019t imply anything negative about you personally.

You're not a child to get offended at being asked to wash their hands, are you?", "YTA. Try to keep up. You are first up in the morning.

That's pretty gross. I live alone and I'm the only one who eats off of my dishes and I still wash my hands before I put them away.

Wash your hands before touching clean dishes.  Wash your hands before cooking and every time you change what you're prepping (ie, wash your hands after prepping meat and before moving on to veggies, and then wash again after prepping veggies).

Didn't the pandemic teach you that germs are on every single surface you touch, and then you transfer those germs to the next surface you touch?", "YTA.

Like you, it had never really occurred to me to wash my hands before putting away dishes. It never even came up when I was living with family/roommates/partners. And now I live alone and no one but me ever has to touch or eat off those dishes. So, N T A for not being in the habit to begin with. The part where YTA is that your partner has made it clear that it's important to her that you wash your hands first, and instead of obliging by adding a mere 30 seconds to your dishes routine, you're being argumentative and insisting that it's no big deal. When you live with a partner, you learn to compromise to make that living space comfortable for both of you. In this case, it does not harm you to wash your hands, but it does harm her to feel like the dishes are not hygienic.", "NAH.\n\nI can understand why you never thought of it but actually your girlfriend is right.

This is basic food safety that you seem to think is an affront to your character or something.", "YTA. How is this even up for debate???", "YTA. And honestly, she probably said something to you because she noticed smudgy fingerprints on things, which means your hands aren't clean.", "YTA. I always do just that and would appreciate that it was reciprocal.\n\nI also do it before folding clean clothes and towels.", "YTA, can you absolutely guarantee you haven't touched the more private parts of your body while asleep? Your hands could very well be disgusting.", "NTA I\u2019ve literally never heard of washing hands before putting dishes away. This post really brings out all the germaphobes and hypochondriacs. Of course I\u2019m assuming you did shower before getting dressed and that you wash your hands after using the toilet.", "YTA. I  clean my hands before I put away clean dishes.  It\u2019s the same thing as not wearing muddy shoes in the house.  Wash your hands", "NTA. You understand that this is important to her to feel this way and that\u2019s cool. it\u2019s really up to you. If it\u2019s that important to her, she can do it.

I wash my hands after using the bathroom and cleaning dirty dishes. Is this the hill you want to die on? Probably not. But you\u2019re not the AH for not wanting to do this. Don\u2019t take it personally.\n\nEdit to add: ppl are way too germophobic.  This is why folks end up with allergies. You have an immune system for a reason. Unless someone is immunocompromised, you\u2019re probably not gonna get sick from waking up and putting the dishes away unless you\u2019ve been scratching your ass all night", "Info:  Are you going to wash your hands before?", "NAH, but people need to pick their battles more carefully. What\u2019s it take, 30 seconds to wash your hands? So wash them. Or go nuclear and break up if your hygiene expectations are so different.", "NTA Being too strict on hygiene is as dangerous as not being strict enough. Your immune system will not be able to properly fight anything. And no, it is not normal to wash hands before handling dishes.", "NTA because that's not something that I've ever heard of being done, but also I don't think she is being a total AH or suggesting your hands are dirty. I think her family may have done something differently and to her this might be normal.

Wash your hands, it's not a big ask to have clean hands to put up clean dishes.", "NTA.

It\u2019s a simple and reasonable request with a logical explanation. Plus, why would you NOT want your hands to be clean when TOUCHING WHERE YOUR FOOD WILL SIT? Everyone has dirty hands most of the time. You should wash them periodically throughout the day to minimize germ spread, but ESPECIALLY before you touch food receptacles.

On one end of the spectrum are people who will walk straight into their bedroom carpet with their street sneakers. On the other end are people who ask their guests to remove shoes at the door and give everyone house slippers. There\u2019s no absolute right way, it culturally varies and individuals have different cleanliness preferences on top of that. The people who keep shoes out of the house will definitely have the cleaner floors, and that doesn\u2019t mean the shoes-inside people have to switch to the same priorities. \n\nBut two people who choose to live together and presumably love each other have to find something that works for both of them, and it\u2019s much easier for OP to just take the 30 seconds to wash his hands than it is to, say, have his wife take over dish-unloading duty instead. \n\nAnd I\u2019m someone who showers at night.", "As far as concessions in relationships go, this one is incredibly small and tame, and I think if OP was annoyed that he was constantly being asked to concede so many such things, he would have said so to back up his point. I\u2019m not really worried about a slippery slope to her controlling him here. More likely, cheerful clean hands without argument = happier wife who is more willing to jump up and do OP the next favor he asks for.", "Hahaha I was agreeing with you too", "I mean if you did that then yes wash your hands.
