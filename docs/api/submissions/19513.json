Nine years old is plenty old enough to know better.\n\nYour parents are major AHs as well as your brother. Are they not aware that adults who commit cruel acts often started out with animal cruelty in childhood? They go looking for something smaller than themselves that they can hurt, and animals and small children are often their targets.\n\nYour parents need to step up and act like parents. They need to teach him that it is wrong to hurt sentient beings. This really is a turning point for them and for your brother. If they brush aside deliberate cruelty with \"kids will be kids\" and \"he didn't know any better\" and they don't do something about it, they are failing him, and you.", "NTA. Forgiveness is earned.

What are they trying to catch you doing? That behavior is creepily controlling and violates your right to a safe, private space (if you'd been caught sneaking people in or growing weed in your closet this would be a slightly different convo). So just understand this isn't normal and isn't okay.

What in the world ?", "You are NTA and you have every right to be upset over how your mice were treated. Protect them and keep him away", "Came here to say this.\n\nOP, your parents are major AHs. It's not normal to place cameras in your rooms. What reason do they have to do such a thing?\n\nYour brother could have a mental health issue, but it's also likely he's acting out because he and you are both mice in the cage your parents built for you.", "I understand the concern but I promise my parents are not abusive. The reason the cameras are all over the house is because I struggle with my mental health a bit and my parents are worried I\u2019ll harm myself or make a suicide attempt.", "This as well! Totally not normal.", "I'm a psychologist in my day job. I would say 9-year-olds don't comprehend the entirety of their actions, it's true. However, they DO know on a basic level, that it's very wrong to hurt animals. So I personally think you're being way too dismissive, of the potential seriousness of this situation. \n\nUnless he has a significant mental health/developmental disorder, he KNEW he was distressing/hurting these little animals (that would have been clear to a 9-year-old before he did it - and definitely clear, as he actually was doing it). So it's worrying he continued, despite their distress. \n\nIt's even more disturbing, that he even had the impulse to hurt/distress these animals in the first place. Even if 9-year-olds don't comprehend the entirety of their actions, most AREN'T hurting animals regardless. That's because most kids that age, don't have the impulse to hurt animals. He has a sadistic streak (combined with a lack of empathy), and that's a worry.\n\nIt may well be a reaction to how he's being parented (which sounds unhealthy and controlling, as it involves filming in bedrooms). It doesn't automatically make him a developing sociopath. But I see why OP feels she can't forgive him, despite his age (since he DID know he was doing wrong, and was acting out of a sadistic impulse). \n\nWhether she eventually forgives him or not is her choice - but it is a bit much, under these circumstances, for the parents to expect quick forgiveness. I hope OP doesn't get pulled into the minimisation and dismissiveness her parents show, and realises this is potentially serious. With a sadistic streak, lack of empathy, and parental minimisation - there's a significant risk of it happening again. OP needs to at least find a way to stop him accessing her mice (such as a lock on her door).", "Your parents need to be more concerned with your brother. Animal cruelty is an early warning sign of sociopathy/psychopathy", "It's definitely a serious situation, but still I could see things being unclear. Look at how we treat cows, pigs, chickens in our society in farming ... and mice are often seen as vermin and killed (I kill mice in my house with snap traps for my own safety from disease). The difference between acceptable and unacceptable animal cruelty is not necessarily clear cut. \n\nThis is an opportunity for the parents and possibly OP to say, these are pets. Your sister loves them. What you did was wrong.\n\nIf she doesn't want to forgive him, that's fine, but obviously unless he continues this pattern of behavior indefinitely, she will probably want to forgive him eventually. If children act on cruel impulses, treating them like pariahs forever isn't going to make them less cruel. It's not on OP to fix this, and the parents should absolutely be more understanding of the cruelty and allow OP to take the space she needs, but this is not an unforgivable offense imo.", "NTA, but I\u2019m very concerned about the fact that there is a camera in your bedroom. This is deeply unsettling.", "NTA\n\nWhile I appreciate that your brother totally did the wrong thing, the fact that there are cameras in every room in your house, including your bedroom, is extremely disturbing.\n\nThis kind of monitoring and control is abuse and unacceptable. You need to find a way to alert someone, a school counsellor perhaps, that this is happening.   \nI\u2019m concerned for you as you seem to think this is completely normal, something any strict parent would do, which is totally not true.   \nI wonder if your brother is acting out because of how strict & controlling your parents are. After all he knows there are cameras in every room yet he still abused the mouse, knowing he\u2019d get caught on camera. Or does he not yet know about the cameras?", "Nta\nHe's 9, not a toddler. I teach younger kids than him and they know it's wrong.\nYour parents are also ah here.

Any injuries?", "NTA. \n\nAsk you parents what\u2019s the point of having cameras in your bedroom if they do nothing while your little brother is working his way up the serial killer ladder?\n\nWhen you turn 18, gtfo. Cameras in every room including bedrooms is not normal.", "NTA.  Based on your replies to other comments your parents are worried about the wrong child.  Your brother being cruel to animals can be a sign of serious mental illness.  They need to get him evaluated sooner rather than later.  He's 9, he knows how to properly treat an animal unless your parents failed to teach him to be gentle when he was a toddler.", "NTA, your brother needs precessional help, it\u2019s not likely that\u2019s just behaviour he would just do out of the blue, and even if it is he still needs to tan to someone about why he would do it in the first place.", "Nta. He's 9, the mouse showed distress and he kept hurting her. A little monster.\nIf smart and old enough to open cage and hurt her for pleasure,then old enough to know it was a bad thing he did. He waited until you were out if house to hurt her.", "NTA, this is honestly extremely alarming behavior and children that torture animals often end up being serial killers and abusers. \n\nI would keep an eye on him, and put a lock on your door to keep your poor little mice safe. It's NOT normal to do this. I wouldn't forgive him either and would sleep with my door locked. \n\nIf there are any missing or killed pets in the neighborhood, I'd truly consider him. Absolutely terrifying", "The fact that your parents are not trying to get him immediate therapy is extremely alarming. If he does something like this again, you said I was you, I'd report him to CPS. \n\nNTA and be careful", "NTA", "Nta that is some serious signs of getting the kid to see a psychiatrist", "I\u2019ve replied to another comment under here further explaining the camera situation. They\u2019re there not only because my parents are strict but also mainly because I struggle with my mental health a bit and they are concerned about me harming myself or attempting suicide.", "Hun, even if that is their reasoning it's still not ok and is abusive. Abusive doesn't just refer to physical abuse but also emotional and mental trauma and being monitored like that isn't healthy for you or them. They should seek out help for you and get you a good psychiatrist and therapist, not put cameras in your room. If you have a doctor you speak to regularly about your issues please bring up the cameras because it's not ok. Your parents may have good intentions but it doesn't mean it's still not abusive.", "My wife attempted suicide 17 times. I can promise you that if I installed cameras in every room, she would have succeeded. \n\nWhat you and your parents need to do is to go to the nearest emergency room with a mental health unit and tell them you have suicidal thoughts. They will take good care of you. \n\nAlso take down the cameras. Even the fucking mental health institutes do not have cameras, thats extremely abusive.\n\nI can promise you that the cameras are not helping you. How did your brother manage to hurt the mice with your cameras? Shouldnt your mom have beem able to stop your brother on the spot? How does she hope to stop a suicide attempt then? 9h later??", "NTA. Ask his parents to punish him. That is, sitting on the ground, with no TV, etc. apologizing is not enough", "I understand that they are concerned. However, I still think it's unacceptable to be monitored 24/7. \n\nI hope you are getting therapy to get better. \n\nRegarding your brother: Animal cruelty is a early sign of serious mental illness. Your parents should be concerned and seek help. He is old enough to understand he is harming the animal.

It is a massive over step in the best case scenario.", "Op Im going to be serious for a moment. Cameras in your bedroom is potentially a CSA crime. If they have video footage of you undressed or whatever else, they are actively producing explicit material of you and this is not normal or okay. \n\nPlease stop justifying this weird and creepy behavior, there is no good reason at all why cameras should be in a minor's bedroom. Nothing on earth justifies this violation of privacy. \nI hope you have a trusted adult in your life that you can talk to about it, be it a teacher or family member other than your parents. \n\nNTA. My ex watched my mice at his house for a few weeks once and they both suddenly and mysteriously died. I suspect he starved them or worse. Im very sorry your little friend is scared, and I hope she warms back up to you soon. Something is very wrong with your brother.", "Yeah no it's abusive.", "That's not the reason they're doing it, it's about control. A camera isn't going to stop you from hurting yourself just like it didn't stop your brother from hurting your mice.", "Intentionally harming the living. Targeting the weakest.
