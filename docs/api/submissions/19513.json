Nine years old is plenty old enough to know better.\n\nYour parents are major AHs as well as your brother. Are they not aware that adults who commit cruel acts often started out with animal cruelty in childhood? They go looking for something smaller than themselves that they can hurt, and animals and small children are often their targets.\n\nYour parents need to step up and act like parents. They need to teach him that it is wrong to hurt sentient beings. This really is a turning point for them and for your brother. If they brush aside deliberate cruelty with \"kids will be kids\" and \"he didn't know any better\" and they don't do something about it, they are failing him, and you.", "NTA. Forgiveness is earned.

What are they trying to catch you doing? That behavior is creepily controlling and violates your right to a safe, private space (if you'd been caught sneaking people in or growing weed in your closet this would be a slightly different convo). So just understand this isn't normal and isn't okay.

What in the world ?", "You are NTA and you have every right to be upset over how your mice were treated. Protect them and keep him away", "Came here to say this.\n\nOP, your parents are major AHs. It's not normal to place cameras in your rooms. What reason do they have to do such a thing?\n\nYour brother could have a mental health issue, but it's also likely he's acting out because he and you are both mice in the cage your parents built for you.", "I understand the concern but I promise my parents are not abusive. The reason the cameras are all over the house is because I struggle with my mental health a bit and my parents are worried I\u2019ll harm myself or make a suicide attempt.", "This as well! Totally not normal.", "I'm a psychologist in my day job. I would say 9-year-olds don't comprehend the entirety of their actions, it's true. However, they DO know on a basic level, that it's very wrong to hurt animals. So I personally think you're being way too dismissive, of the potential seriousness of this situation. \n\nUnless he has a significant mental health/developmental disorder, he KNEW he was distressing/hurting these little animals (that would have been clear to a 9-year-old before he did it - and definitely clear, as he actually was doing it). So it's worrying he continued, despite their distress. \n\nIt's even more disturbing, that he even had the impulse to hurt/distress these animals in the first place. Even if 9-year-olds don't comprehend the entirety of their actions, most AREN'T hurting animals regardless. That's because most kids that age, don't have the impulse to hurt animals. He has a sadistic streak (combined with a lack of empathy), and that's a worry.\n\nIt may well be a reaction to how he's being parented (which sounds unhealthy and controlling, as it involves filming in bedrooms). It doesn't automatically make him a developing sociopath. But I see why OP feels she can't forgive him, despite his age (since he DID know he was doing wrong, and was acting out of a sadistic impulse). \n\nWhether she eventually forgives him or not is her choice - but it is a bit much, under these circumstances, for the parents to expect quick forgiveness. I hope OP doesn't get pulled into the minimisation and dismissiveness her parents show, and realises this is potentially serious. With a sadistic streak, lack of empathy, and parental minimisation - there's a significant risk of it happening again. OP needs to at least find a way to stop him accessing her mice (such as a lock on her door).", "Your parents need to be more concerned with your brother. Animal cruelty is an early warning sign of sociopathy/psychopathy", "It's definitely a serious situation, but still I could see things being unclear. Look at how we treat cows, pigs, chickens in our society in farming ... and mice are often seen as vermin and killed (I kill mice in my house with snap traps for my own safety from disease). The difference between acceptable and unacceptable animal cruelty is not necessarily clear cut. \n\nThis is an opportunity for the parents and possibly OP to say, these are pets. Your sister loves them. What you did was wrong.\n\nIf she doesn't want to forgive him, that's fine, but obviously unless he continues this pattern of behavior indefinitely, she will probably want to forgive him eventually. If children act on cruel impulses, treating them like pariahs forever isn't going to make them less cruel. It's not on OP to fix this, and the parents should absolutely be more understanding of the cruelty and allow OP to take the space she needs, but this is not an unforgivable offense imo."]}
