Townes got in trouble for selling snacks. Townes has a friend who he met on vacation a few months ago, a boy from Panama. They both love baseball and will send each other gifts or souvenirs and snacks from each kid\u2019s country. Townes said that he sold some of the snacks this boy sent him with the boy\u2019s permission, which was against school rules. He got 2 days of detention and said what was worse was his coach telling him he\u2019s disappointed in him, since he\u2019s normally a good kid.\r  \n\r  \nThen we asked Emaline what she did, she didn\u2019t answer because she said she was being \u201cunfairly bullied\u201d for it. Townes then started to look like he was going to hold back tears, we asked him if he needed to talk to someone and he asked to talk to me. \r  \n\r  \nHe said that Emaline had said some racist things to a Hispanic boy, making jokes about his culture and heritage and how she got suspended for 3 days and that she was getting some pushback, but he thought it was justified pushback.\r  \n\r  \nI then asked my husband to speak to me, after talking, we asked Merlin to talk to us. \r  \n\r  \nWe told Merlin we were concerned about Emaline\u2019s behavior and he said that both kids got in trouble, so we should also be concerned about Townes then. We told him it wasn\u2019t the same and also told him he needed to address Townes\u2019s feeling about this. He dismissed us. We then told him if he didn\u2019t take these actions that him and Emaline wouldn\u2019t be getting Christmas gifts. \r  \n\r  \nHe then talked to his wife and I could see her get uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nWhen they got home, he called me to say I was acting immature and overstepping my bounds.

Christmas and birthdays should stand alone.\n\nP.S. I'm curious how a kid gets two days of detention for selling snacks. That's crazy.", "You might be the AH. What she did was fully wrong, horrible even, but you're the grandparents now, and if your son says he's got it, he's got it. Gotta step back and let him do what he has to do, can't undermine him or step in. Causes friction for no reason.\n\nI think your son is a little old for the Christmas threat. I really thought I was gonna come see this was about an adopted child or something, won't lie.", "Maybe YTA.  \n\nWhy does it seem like everything revolves around Townes for you?  Why should your son address Townes feelings in regards to Emaline's punishment?\n\nSurely, she deserves punishment but that shouldn't be dictated at all by her brother.\n\nFirst, I think you're unfairly interfering in your Son's parenting.  If you want to have a frank conversation with Emaline then that seems reasonable but setting ultimatums with your adult son is ridiculous.  \n\nSecond, I think you have favorites here.  Emaline is her own person and should be treated as such.  She's not an extension of Townes feelings, she is her own person.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's why your son pushed back.  You seem to come at all of this from Townes feelings and him being an emotional child.  That's fine that he is, but his feelings don't get to dictate everything and everyone around him.", "YTA\n\nYour son is right, you are overstepping your bounds. Both children have already faced consequences for their actions. Their parents have been dealing with this as they see fit. What do you expect to gain by withholding gifts? Unfortunately, it would likely be a rift with all of them.\n\nEmpathize with what each of them is feeling. Make yourself available if anyone wants to talk. Encourage them to keep discussing it among themselves. Then, butt out unless your help is requested. Anything else is meddling and manipulative.", "Of course your son dismissed you - you were chiding him at a family dinner, in front of his wife, kids, and siblings, as if _he_ was a misbehaving child and not a grown adult. You are not owed details of how he is disciplining his kids, and the extended family is owed them even less. You poked and prodded and overstepped your role as grandparents, all because your son wouldn\u2019t open up a public litany of the punishments doled out to his children, and refused to drop everything and prioritize your concerns about the feelings of one kid.\n\nThis is not being a loving and supportive grandparent. You may mean well, but you are overstepping, your son clearly feels that your behaviour is inappropriate, and it sounds a lot like you\u2019re trying to undermine his parenting because he\u2019s not giving you every tiny detail that you want. And then you doubled down and tried to blackmail him into doing what you wanted by threatening him and your granddaughter over Christmas.\n\nYou have no idea what actions your son and his wife are taking, what steps have already been taken to \u201cconsider Townes\u2019 feelings\u201d, because instead of asking if there\u2019s anything you can do to help, you started telling grown adults off and tried to threaten them into doing what you wanted,\n\nIt sucks that Emaline was racist, but her parents and the school are dealing with it. You don\u2019t need to get involved unless your son _asks_ you to be involved, and you shouldn\u2019t be levying your own punishments in an attempt to exert control.\n\nAt this rate you\u2019ll be lucky if you see any of Merlin\u2019s family over Christmas. That\u2019s certainly how I\u2019d deal with your overstepping and threats, if you were my parent.", "Both kids received punishment from school authorities for breaking school policies.  Emaline received 3 days, one day more than your grandson.\n\nWhile it\u2019s positive your grandson talks to you about his concerns, the answer isn\u2019t for you to insert yourself, act like a superior court arbiter, and demand greater punishment or you will withhold Christmas gifts.  \n\nFrankly, the likely lesson learned for Emaline is to admit to nothing, say nothing, around her grandparents.  Is that the outcome you want for this relationship?\n\nYTA for threatening to withhold gifts to get your way.  Manipulative.  Shame on you.", "I think it's because, hustling for money on school grounds, and being racist, are not the same , I'm not even sure why they considered punishing townes. Emmaline is the only one who actually did something bad.", "NTA. This is hugely problematic (the racism issue). If it were a matter of breaking curfew or not doing hw, everyone who is calling you an AH would be right - but you are merely showing consequences for a VERY serious issue that your son does not seem to be taking seriously. Xmas gifts aren't *owed*, and if she wants to be a little racist turd and your son and wife want to be ok with that, F them all. Townes sounds like the only one who has done nothing wrong here, get him xmas gifts and the rest f-ing coal.", "YTA. Emaline was already punished, she didn't want to say what she'd done so was clearly embarrassed by what she'd done. You want your son to give Emaline more punishment, and are going to withhold Christmas gifts from your son and Emaline. \n\nCongratulations on being the \"bad\" grandma eho wants to control everyone else and uses gifts to punish relatives. Don't be surprised if your son decides to start a new Christmas breakfast tradition that doesn't involve you.", "YTA- what gives you the right to dictate how a grandchild is punished for their behaviour?  Why do you think you have the right to place yourself in the role of the parent and dish out punishments for an incident you were not involved in? \n\nThe school has intervened, the parents have already dealt with the situation and now both children have seen what happens if they show poor character again. \n\nYour concerns are justified, your intervention is not.", "Your granddaughter was suspended (your grandson only got detention) and it sounds like she knows what she was wrong or she would have told you what she did and try to justify it.\nThreatening to take away Christmas presents seems like an overreach.", "YTA...your concern is justified, your demands are not.", "YTA - wow you are so unreasonable with this. Wind your neck in \n\nYour son is dealing with it, school has dealt with it by a suspension. Your son and daughter in law are the parents. By all means be disappointed your GDTR behaved in a racist way. But you don\u2019t control your son\u2019s parental behaviour  like this, he\u2019s already dealing with it. You had your parenting time. Let your son have his now", "Nope, NTA. At all. Your granddaughter is being racist and her dad doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything about it.

Sure christmas is about generosity but there's also a HUGE PUNISHMENT ASPECT people are willfully ignoring. It's not just culturally acceptable but encouraged for Christmas to be used as a negative consequence to bad behavior. (And for anyone thinking the coal and no presents part is santa only well then I guess the generosity is, too?)\n\nIf someone in my life on my gift roster got outed for racially harassing someone I wouldn't buy them a gift that year. Gifts are not mandatory, NTA", "Yes YTA. My goodness you are nosy, invasive and pushy.  You have raised your family. It's not your place to parent your grandchildren or issue ultimatums regarding parenting to your son. I hope he and his wife decide it's in the best interests of their family to put some distance between you and their family and skip Christmas at your home altogether. I certainly would.", "YTA - I appreciate your thoughts on this and in the whole I kind of agree with your thought process.\n\nBut - you weaponised christmas presents. 'Do this or they won't get anything off us...'\n\nWho does that benefit? It makes everything worse and sounds very petty and although I agree with a lot of what you put but Merlins wife is right - you are being immature.\n\nThese are their kids. In general it seems they are well looked after and supported and you seem to have raised a good son.\n\nIt is also clear in your text that you favour your grandson, and perhaps that is obvious to your son as well.", "YTA for using gifts as leverage.\n\nBut as a grandparent myself, what I have learned is this:\n\nWe do not have control over our children.  We have only influence.  If we exert control, we risk giving up influence.  \n\nThis is ESPECIALLY true for adult children, and even more true for our kids who are already parenting teenagers.  \n\nYou need to apologize, asap, or there won't be any Christmas breakfasts that include Merlin's family.", "I'm thinking your granddaughter picked up her racism from her dad seeing as he thinks selling snacks and bullying using racism are on the same level.", "The Y T A votes on here astound me. Racism isn't ok. It certainly isn't the same as a side-hustle selling snacks. Telling your kid you are concerned that your granddaughter is showing racist tendencies seems... pretty responsible. She isn't getting that from nowhere. Someone is showing her that is normal behavior. If it is at home, the parents need to be corrected. If it isn't at home, the parents need to get a fire lit under their ass to find out where and correct it. Nothing suggests her parents are taking her racist comments seriously.\n\nNobody is entitled to Christmas presents. Grandparents can withhold them if their grandkids are behaving poorly, just as grandkids can do so to grandparents that behave poorly.\n\nNTA", "NTA - \n\nYour son is correct. He is the parent and he and his wife get to call the shots in THEIR house.  \n\n\nThat doesn't include whether or not his children get gifts from their grandparents, does it?\n\nWithholding gifts from 13 year old teenagers for being a racist bully and/or getting suspended for selling things against school rules isn't being petty. It is consequences for actions.", "NTA - racist kids, and their parents, deserve dirt and coal", "YTA\n\nYou definitely are overstepping.\n\nTrust that your kids can parent their kids.", "YTA if you actually named your kid Merlin", "Absolutely NTA.  It\u2019s extremely disturbing that your son somehow thinks these incidents are remotely equivalent.  If he is not going to be a parent here I feel terrible for the son.", "YTA - your overstepping when it\u2019s your sons job to parent.", "YTA - They are not your children. They are your grandchildren. Their parents should be the ones managing their discipline. Also withholding Christmas as a punishment is real petty.

NTA. That\u2019s more than a fair punishment and her parents don\u2019t seem to be doing anything. But it also seems like someone should talk to her about the specific comments so she can learn why they\u2019re SO wrong.\n\nPeople are not entitled to gifts, it\u2019s your choice if you want to give them.", "I\u2019m afraid YTA.  You need to defer discipline to the actual parents.  You\u2019ve said yourself that these are good kids and have, up to this moment, been good students and people.  It\u2019s fair to say that their parents have been doing a very good job at raising them. \n\nInserting your opinions, forcibly I will add, is heavy handed and likely to backfire.  You are choosing a high friction pathway that can easily go very bad for you.  \n\nFor instance, if I was in your son\u2019s place and you chose to withhold gifts unless I did as you said, I wouldn\u2019t be coming over to visit now, on Christmas morning or any other time soon.  I\u2019ll take my child\u2019s side as \u2018ride or die\u2019 and leave you out because my children are entering an age that is the most perilous so I\u2019m not doing anything that will reduce their trust in me.  \n\nDespite what you think are good intentions, you\u2019re substituting your judgement for theirs and not very gracefully.", "ESH this is an excellent opportunity for you to give a different kind of gift this year. Instead of the usual gifts you could give experiences where they could learn about a different culture or encourage the older one to come up with different ideas for income (cause really that\u2019s what this was about). \n\nSo you shouldn\u2019t threaten withholding gifts and the parents seem a little blas\u00e9 about the racism which is really not good but they are the parents and you likely aren\u2019t privy to the discussions that were had.", "YTA. You\u2019re the grandma. NOT the parent. It\u2019s not your job to punish your grandchildren, nor is it your job to tell your son and DIL how to parent. That\u2019s up to them. Also, you may not mean it this way, but it *really* seems like your grandson is your \u201cgolden grandchild\u201d, at least between the twins. You might want to get a handle on that.", "YTA.  I am your age with adult kids and grandkids.  \n\nDon't weaponize Christmas.  \nButt out and stop interrogating them.  Your son has it under control.  Apologize to him for overreacting and overreaching.", "YTA\n\nYou advised your children. That's fine, if done delicately and done ONCE. Then the parents have to make their decision.\n\nBut to punish your grandkids by not giving them gifts when you're not happy with their decisions as parents? How does that make sense?", "I think your intentions are good, and your concern is justified.  I think your son is making a huge mistake trying to equate the two transgression.  Unfortunately, that\u2019s his mistake as a parent to make.  I don\u2019t think you were wrong to express your concern, but you are not in control here, and you are leveraging Christmas and material things, Iie. money, to get your way.

If he doesn't do what you say, will you send him to his room without dinner?", "YTA, and if you were my parents, I would have quickly escorted you back to your lane. It is not your place to dictate how your son and DIL discipline their children with the exception of unnecessary cruelty. All your threats will do is drive a wedge between you and your son's family, and you might start seeing less of your twin grandchildren.", "YTA, you have no say or position in the discipline of your grand children.   Your son and his wife have sole authority and can do whatever they\u2019ll feel is best for their kids without having to consider your input.", "YTA - A grandparent\u2019s role is not to discipline their grandchild or to diminish them.", "YTA You are the grandparent not the parent. Let the parents parent. \n\nIf you single out a grandchild and don\u2019t get them Christmas gifts, then expect your family to be rightfully furious and cut off contact.", "YTA because you are taking Townes word on everything. Yes, it is good that, as a guy, he isn't afraid to cry/show his emotions, but he seems to be using your sympathy to that to get your favor over Emaline. \n\n\nMaybe she didn't want to talk about it with you because she doesn't trust you to actually listen to her or nuance. \n\n\nYes, racism is wrong. But there is a difference between if it's out of the blue or if this kid was otherwise bullying her/being inappropriate beforehand. Racism is wrong, but there are certain nuances about it. There are differences between \"eww, you eat with your hands,\" and \"brown people are stupid\". I work in a school, albeit with mostly younger kids, and I've definitely gotten statements that are racist, but said entirely out of ignorance, not malice. And you have no idea if she apologized, how the school is addressing it, etc. Education, not punative punishments, are the answer.\n\n\nBut Townes cried because he didn't like his sister's behavior and that's enough information for you?", "YTA: you are a grandparent not a parent, you are crossing serious boundaries. Grandparents have zero say on how to discipline children unless they have custody or are helping to raise the kids", "YTA\n\nYou were very much in the N T A territory to raise the issue Merlin and explain why his daughter\u2019s racist remarks were far more serious and definitely needed more punishment and correction than his son\u2019s.\n\nBut then it\u2019s up to the parents to dole out any punishment. Not you. And especially not with Christmas presents - that sounds sooo petty and unrelated to the crime. It completely undermines the valid point you were trying to make by refocusing the discussion around how stupid your threat was rather than how bad Emaline\u2019s actions were.\n\nAlso, Christmas - especially for kids - is a time of joy and celebration. Don\u2019t ruin that for your grandkids by making their Christmas celebration conditional over a punishment that overrides their parents.
