{"id": 30180, "submission_id": "17m22rd", "title": "AITA rewarding both daughters despite different results", "selftext": "I have two daughters Zoe (18) and Alexis (17). They're both in year 12 and almost done with their final exams. Zoe is my stepdaughter if it makes a difference.\n\nWhen it comes to school the girls are opposite. Alexis is like young and dumb me, and chooses to coast on her natural ability. She puts in the minimum yet has amazing grades. Zoe, on the other hand, struggles. She tries extremely hard and is tutored but always struggled to get C's in more academic subjects. To be clear, I'm not saying this to diminish Alexis, I was exactly the same as her back then and she's gotten amazing results. However I have literally never seen her study aside from the literal day of a SAC/exam. I'm proud of her for a lot of things, but her attitude to education just isn't one. Both girls are great even if both have their flaws. So I plan to reward both girls for finishing school and their results/efforts.\n\nThe issue is yesterday Alexis had her math methods exam and Zoe had her business exam. Alexis refused to give more than one word answers as usual, so I left it at saying I'm proud of her and sure she did great. Zoe on the other hand was happy with how it went, telling me she managed to finish and felt really confident on it. Considering last week she was crying because she couldn't finish English (it's designed so most students don't or barely), it was an achievement. I was really proud of her and let her know, making sure to be supportive. However Alexis later got upset and claimed it's not fair that I 'baby' and favour her. She thinks I'm proud of Zoe despite her being worse, so she must be the favourite. Even though I literally told Alexis I was proud of her earlier. I don't agree with her attitude and have tried to motivate her to study, but I'm still proud of the results she's gotten so far. She's valedictorian and I'll eat my hat if she doesn't get into uni. But I'm not going to not be proud of Zoe because she's getting worse results. \n\nAlexis insists that I should be more proud of her, and that it's unfair for Zoe to get the same reward, but thats nonsense. I tried to explain it to her but she just got increasingly more upset, so I told her we'd talk about it more today and tried to assure her I love her. Unfortunately she decided to go to my ex's instead today so we haven't talked beyond my ex accusing me of being a piece of shit father and saying I need to prioritise \"your actual daughter\".\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to reward both. Alexis has better grades but Zoe put in a lot more effort. Both will finish high school in the next two weeks and I'd say they're almost guaranteed to achieve their goals. So both deserve praise and reward. If I had to guess I think it's just my ex being so results-focussed as usual twisting her perspective but it's possible I'm not being as equal as I think. I didn't mean to upset Alexis with this", "created_utc": 1698927119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m22rd/aita_rewarding_both_daughters_despite_different/", "score": 502, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had siblings and step siblings that struggled. There is going to be a point in her education that she isn\u2019t going to be able to rely on only her natural ability any more and it is going to be a harsh lesson for her. When this happens? It will hopefully be the point she realises that others have had to do this hard work the rest of the time and she may begin to respect their work ethic more. \n\nHonestly? You are treating the girls as fairly as you can and I have a suspicion it is your ex putting it into your daughters head that she should be treated \u201cmore\u201d than the stepdaughter. Everyone should be treating their children equally whether they are 100% biological, adopted, a step sibling, half sibling, foster sibling etc. Good on you for trying to keep it fair.", "INFO: have you rewarded Alexis for being valedictorian of her class?", "NTA but your post does say re: Alexis \u201cI left it at saying I\u2019m proud of her \u201c and Zoe \u201cI was really proud of her and let her know \u201c. Could Alexis be sensing  that you are more proud of Zoe\u2019s efforts and subtly communicating that. Even if she is naturally gifted and the need for perfect grades is instilled by your ex;  Alexis perhaps can\u2019t understand the difference in praise when she is valedictorian.\nEdit letter", "I want to be clear, my response here is based on my personal experience as the gifted child with a sibling who had to work hard for noticeably worse results.\n\nIt sucks to be doing better academically but receive less praise or recognition for your work. I\u2019ve had teachers who refused to give awards at the end of the week because \u2018I didn\u2019t improve\u2019 as I started/ended the year with straight As. I\u2019d do an exam, get 100%, and get a pat on the head. But my brother would get 60% the following year and be taken out to dinner or given cash for results. I once got punished for getting a B overall in a class, which I only got due to missed homework during a medical emergency. My brother got Cs that year and was given congratulations and a reward. And what no one seemed to notice was that I did work hard. Easily 3 hours a day on homework. An afternoon each weekend on studying for exams. I\u2019d have an exam prep timetable approximately 3 months before major exams. But because I never received lower than a B+, and was a big multitasker who did it whilst watching tv or chatting with my family, it counted for nothing. Ironically, my brother worked fewer hours, put less effort in, but because he had disabilities and learning difficulties, him putting in an hour a day was a big achievement to be celebrated. \n\nNow, your post says Alexis never really tries. But I do wonder (from my own personal experience) if she does more than you perhaps realise\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m just projecting. And to be clear, I won\u2019t be upset if I am. But I want to offer the perspective that sometimes the gifted child\u2019s hard work can be overlooked, especially in the face of the child who struggles.\n\nEither way, I\u2019d at least try to respond more \u2018equally\u2019 to your daughters in these sorts of situations. It reads as you gave Alexis a simple one-line \u2018you did great and I\u2019m proud\u2019 but Zoe a multi-stanza \u2018congrats for working hard and getting it all done and you\u2019re awesome and I\u2019m SUPER proud\u2019. Those may feel similar, but they\u2019re different responses. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. Im not sure anyone is here. NAH. But I do think that sometimes, in trying to give everyone what they \u2018need\u2019, it\u2019s easy to overlook the emotional needs of the gifted one who \u2018needs\u2019 nothing to achieve highly. Hope this helps, even slightly.", "A 17yo is not the same as an adult and will not react or rationalise like an adult. Your adult logic does not apply here.\n\nWhy is she quiet\n\nWhy does she only give one word responses. \n\nIs this in general or just when it's about school.\n\nYes, teenagers are moody, but there is usually a reason. Sometimes, it's small drama, sometimes not.\n\nShe's your daughter, and you need to look back and remember if she was always this way. If not, when did it start? Is she different when it's 1-1 with you, how does she interact with step sis and step mother, is she quiet when at mothers house is there a step dad/step sibs what's her interaction like with them. Have you spoken with your ex about it and asked what she's like at her house?", "NTA, BUT\n\u201cI left it at saying I\u2019m proud of her \u201c\n\u201cI was really proud of her and let her know \u201c\nit's much more expressed towards Zoe, I can understand why your daughter think you prioritize her", "If I was Alexis I'd give you one word answers too. You call your VALEDICTORIAN CHILD dumb. \"Alexis is like young and dumb me.\" She probably sees talking to you as a waste of breath because she's not your C Student Angel Princess. I'd really recommend you try your hardest since effort important to you to remove your head from your rectum unless you wanna be back here in 5 years complaining about being estranged from your daughter", "NAH for the question asked but I do think you favour Zoe. She trades in the only currency you use which is the amount of hours and effort that is put into to something. It sounds like this isn\u2019t about rewards for Alexis, but praise and being acknowledged. You can treat your children like they do everything the same and are equally good at everything, but children aren\u2019t the same. Alexis apparently needs something else from you, since she doesn\u2019t talk to you and accuse you of favouritism.", "Honestly, seeing the way you talk about Zoe vs. Alexis, you do come across as favoring Zoe. I don\u2019t disagree with giving them both gifts for their achievements or trying to encourage Alexis to study but the way you talk about Alexis is very detached compared to Zoe. When talking about Zoe you make sure you clarify you\u2019re not trying to diminish her or her achievements in school when acknowledging her struggles but you then call Alexis both lazy and dumb in this post without blinking twice. Not to mention diminishing her hard work to become valedictorian because she doesn\u2019t study enough, even though valedictorian is not something someone can just achieve without lots of hard work, studying or not. Clearly you love both of them but, whether you know it or not, there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019re treating them differently in favor of Zoe. It also seems as though you don\u2019t put as much effort into interacting with Alexis as you do with Zoe after reading your comments. Most likely, Alexis\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t really about the gift, it\u2019s about wanting to feel seen, loved, and supported by her father in a way she feels she\u2019s not getting (not saying you don\u2019t see, love and support her but that she might not feel it because of the differences in the way you interact with her vs Zoe)", "Ehhh I\u2019m gonna go with NAH because I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s about the grades. Judging from her behavior,  I think Alexis is maybe (and I may be reading too much into this) wanting some individual recognition and attention and she might be struggling to communicate that. \n\nYou can give both girls that individual recognition and attention if you\u2019re worried about playing favorites and do it in a way that is not comparable between the two. You can reward Alexis for all her accomplishments and Zoe for her hard work. Just do it individually. Make the rewards related to their individual interests and accomplishments. It\u2019s a lot more effort and I know this all started from a few comments in a conversation, but it could really make a world of difference.", "YTA. Being valedictorian is a great achievement. Even if it seems like she doesn\u2019t care she\u2019s clearly listening in school and doing her work which does require effort. Your daughter is clearly crying out for some special attention from you, and I think it sucks that all she got was a pat on the back.", "Unless you have a cam in your daughter's room and monitor her laptop, you don't know how much she studied. What she does is extremely impressive and many parents' dream, however she does it (except for cheating but there's no reason to suspect it). She deserves more than a couple words even when (and especially when) she is a moody teen. So NTA for rewarding both but you need to pay more attention to Alexis. Show her you appreciate her achievements, talk to your ex to decide on a nice graduation gift (and it does not have to match with the Zoe's gift).", "NTA\n\nAlexis needs to understand (meaning you need to explain it better) that the result is not the only thing that matters. It's also the attitude and effort. There also seems to be some deeper issue as the \"favoritism\" talk is definitely not only because of this. Better to talk it through with her or even better, go for a counseler session together.\n\nShe also needs to understand that different people have different goals but achieving them may take a lot of effort even though their objective value is different. Its fairly easy for a fit person to run a mile in like 7 minutes, but a person with asthma may even be glad that they managed to keep running the whole mile and not stopping halfway. While running all the way is stupidly easy for the first person, the amount of effort it took for the second one is unimaginable to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe studying habits that kids get early on prove to be very useful later in university. I was the same as Alexis, I needed to barely do any work to get full scores. This later bit me in the ass in university, when it simply wasnt enough anymore and I actually needed to start working quite hard. From putting in like 1hr/week outside of school to like 20hr/week outside of school. I was desparate and barely gettign by. If I had the habits, I would be used to putting in atleast some work (like looking over what I need to know and making sure im okay) and I would find out much earlier than like 3 weeks in that I actually need to work hard.", "INFO: Is Zoe your step-daughter? I'm asking because of the \"your actual daughter\" comment. If so, how long have the girls been in each others lives?", "Honestly I wanna go NAH here. You\u2019re fine praising them both but I can see where Alexis is coming from if only because I was Alexis at 17. I really didn\u2019t study or go the extra mile but took my honors and APs, finished top 10 all that jazz and couldn\u2019t figure out why other people would get praised just because they tried harder for a worse result. That being said your ex is a massive AH and I have a feeling this is more about Zoe\u2019s existence in Alexis\u2019 life than the actual praising issue.\n\nAlso I WISH I was the Zoe when I was younger because college hit me like a bus when I had to actually try and couldnt just coast whereas my friends who did way worse than me in HS had a much easier time in college", "YTA. You are doing a terrible disservice to both your daughters. \n\nOne, who, even if you don't call her 'dumb and lazy' to her face, are probably doing it through your actions and attitudes, is being informed that being freaking Valedictorian isn't good enough.\n\nThe other is the one who will have the rude awakening once she starts her career and realize her boss doesn't give it shit that she puts in a lot of effort, or that her coworker is 'coasting', only which one is bringing more money. \n\nAlexis is being set up to go NC with you, and Zoe is being set up for failure.", "YTA. Gentle one. I think you shouldn\u2019t call it reward when talk about Zoe. Efforts doesn\u2019t deserve reward, results does. So you are a good parent for wanting to support your daughter for struggles and efforts. You should just change naming, imo.", "NAH - I think Alexis is being a bit dramatic BUT you just told us how different they are from each other and next how you try to treat them equally. That never makes sense to me. \n\nTheyre different kids. If one kid is telling you something, listen and try to understand why they feel that way. Dont just assume you\u2019re doing everything right because you\u2019re treating them the same. Whats best for one kid isnt always whats best for the other.\n\nedit - updating judgment", "NTA -- but I suspect more going on.   Your kid feels she is getting the short end of the stick. Many times, in a second marriage, moms kid get favored.  But do not worry, your kid will go to college, likely have a great career and leave you in the dust.", "This is tough. In my family I was the Alexis and my sister was the Zoe. I got praised less because more was expected of me. \n\nI don't think that is what you're doing here though. It sounds like Alexis isn't engaging with you for whatever reason. I would have interpreted that as being less interested in receiving praise and so being less willing to give it. \n\nMaybe it's time for a heart to heart with Alexis about how you both feel, what she's looking for from you, and how her actions make it hard for you to understand how she's feeling. Overall I'm going with NTA.", "NTA.  It's not a competition, with one winning 1st prize and the other 2nd.  They have both made significant achievements.", "if both have achieved their goals--then definitely rewarding them for \"achieving goals\" is a good thing.\n\nThat said, you won't convince Alexis that you are right, not right now(maybe when she's a parent).", "NTA but I would give Alexis something extra for being valedictorian. They have both worked to get to the end of school their own way and that should definitely be celebrated for both of them! But I get why Alexis expects a little extra and despite recognizing your own flaws in her I think it would be okay to give it to. I think Zoe can probably understand as long as it's not like, here's a car!!!! or w/e. \n\nAs someone who was friends with high-achieving coasters, you can absolutely hit a top GPA without having to study...and it will absolutely bite you in the ass once you go to college or get a job.", "NTA you celebrate each child for where they're at individually. Zoe is like my kid and that hard work/effort deserves the same credit as a high grade. Alexis sounds jealous which to some extent seems normal for her age and the family situation.", "NTA\n\nYou need to have a talk with Alexis, though. She needs to understand two things. \n\nOne, that you can reward her her for her results and Zoe for how much effort she is putting into it and that doesn\u2019t diminish her accomplishments.\n\nSecond, you need to break her of the idea of her happiness being based on how she compares herself to other people. As an old guy who has managed a lot of people in my working career, I will take the downvotes by citing a \u201cstereotype\u201d that was usually true. When male employees were unhappy, it was always because they weren\u2019t getting the pay, promotion, etc. they thought they personally deserved.  When female employees complained, it was often about what another employee (especially female) was getting or doing and how that was unfair.", "NTA. You are tailoring your praise to each child and treating them as individuals by recognizing the differences. This is not favoritism.  It\u2019s simply not holding one child to an impossible measuring stick created by another.  \u201cTo each according to her needs.\u201d  You\u2019ve set expectations based on each girl\u2019s abilities.  You\u2019re offering encouragement and praise accordingly.  \n\nActually, here\u2019s a pat on the back for recognizing that praise shouldn\u2019t just be about who gets the best results.  That just puts them in competition with each other\u2026one in which Zoe was always going to come in second best.  When a child struggles to achieve, they need to know that their efforts are recognized or the risk is that they just stop trying.", "NTA OP you're being as fair as you can. I will say this though - you and a lot of people on here seem to think that Alexis is due some sort of \"come uppance\"  for not working hard enough. The world is not a fair place and sometimes people are just more gifted than others. I was one of those gifted kids in school and wound up going to a top uni. I actually found things got easier when I entered the working world. At a top school or uni everyone is gifted. In the working world it's a more level playing field. If Alexis is coasting because she's gifted, more power to her for working smarter, not harder. Instead of expecting her to work harder, maybe you could encourage her to use her gifts to help others, eg helping her sis from time to time with her studies. Not as a free tutor, mind, but rewarding her by recognising her talents could help lift others up.", "NTA\n\nI'm exactly like Alexis. I look over the stuff like two hours before the exam (unless it's something I really don't get or something that I actually need to practice for) and still manage to get mostly A's or B's, sometimes C's. \n\nHowever, I know how lucky I am. Most of my friends sometimes struggle with learning. They put in a lot of effort, yet I'm still better than them. It does make me feel bad sometimes but that's unrelated.\n\nI do get how she feels though because when you always get good grades it feels like no one's really surprised or proud anymore. It's like you're just livng up to expectations at this point.\n\nBUT she has no right to be rude. It's not like you're only rewarding Zoe. You're rewarding both of them. Alexis for her good grades, Zoe for the effort she put in. \n\nYou're being fair, it's not picking favourites. So no, you're not the asshole.", "NTA \n\nThis isn't a hard one as a parent, but it's a hard one to understand as a kid.\n\nYou've got the toughest job, the hardest lesson to teach.... empathy.\n\nAnd I would approach it a a 'class' to your daughter, and tell her she's going to get graded in her responses and actions. ( I have a feeling her struggling to get an A in this class would be incredibly frustrating to her)\n\nExplain that school is easy to her, she gets top marks effortlessly. If her SS put in her same level of 'work' she would be failing. So her SS works harder to be average, and should she be punished for that? How would she feel if the roles were reversed. And more importantly, how would she respond as a parent in this situation. If she really is a smart kid with empathy, she should be able to come up with the correct response.\n\nIf she won't or can't, that's a bigger discussion about who she is as a person...and maybe a need for a therapist", "NTA.\n\nYou are rewarding Zoe's \\*efforts\\*, as should be.", "Nta sit down and talk to her about how she responds to you.\n\n'Alexis, how am I supposed to comment on your tests when you literally give me 1 word answers?

Your reasoning is sound, both your girls deserve praise for their achievements and for graduating soon! Of course, your choice of words matters and maybe you praising Zoe for her hard work, while you merely acknowledge Alexis' achievements by the by, seems to the latter as if you are less proud of her. Try to talk it out with her and acknowledge her feelings.", "NTA.\n\nThe objective is to treat both fairly (and fairly does not mean equally).\n\nAlexis sounds a little entitled (and it sounds to me she learned that from her mother as that is who she ran to).\n\nAll you can do is explain your position, but do so without anger.", "NTA. They are both your daughters it doesn't matter about one being your step daughter my dad isn't my.bio dad and has never treated me differently to my younger brother. \n\nThey got rewarded for two different things. Alexis for her grades and Zoe for the effort she put in. \n\nYou know what each daughter is capable of and to expect one daughter to match up to the other daughter when their academic ability is different would be unfair.

I wish more people would understand that life is about the effort you put into it, not the results you get out of it. You are being an incredibly fair parent. \n\nIs it possible your daughter might be struggling with fears of being replaced by her step-sister?", "NTA. \nI think effort should be rewarded as well if not more. \nAlexis is jealous of Zoe. Simple as that. But I agree she\u2019s gonna get a rude awakening later in life", "NTA.\n\nHell, I personally think you should reward Zoe more than Alexis.  As a teacher, the one thing I look for above all else is students who are putting in the effort.  \n\nAlexis is in for a rude awakening when she runs into something she can't skate by with natural talent on.  Zoe has learned the studying & test taking skills that will help her tremendously.  Alexis hasn't, and university is where that's most likely going to start biting her in the ass.\n\nI was similar to Alexis in a lot of ways, but I ran into some trouble about midway through high school, so I actually managed to develop semi-decent studying skills.  In many ways, knowing \\*how\\* to learn is way more valuable than just knowing what's expected of you, and it's a shame that grades don't have a place for that.", "You matched your enthusiasm to the person you were talking to. That\u2019s pretty normal. If Alexis doesn\u2019t want to take any time to discuss her achievements then what are you meant to do? Find something she wants to talk about.

But she has not. \n\nHaving a poor work ethic is not something to be congratulated for or celebrated, so she\u2019s lucky so got praise for doing the bare minimum.\n\nZoe on the other hand has strived to improve her situation and worked really flipping hard. That is deserving of praise. Coasting is not.\n\nI\u2019m not going to judge her too harshly because she\u2019s a teenager and teenagers have a bit of a weird perspective on things sometimes.

Zoe will be in a BETTER position to excel as she's already used to studying and practicing her skills and focus. \n\nIt's extremely reasonable to award both. Alexis on her grades and Zoe on her amazing efforts. You need to explain to Alexis that if Zoe didn't put in the work, she wouldn't keep up- that it's great Alexis has a natural ability, but not everyone does and it's a lot more work for Zoe to excel than her, and that doesn't mean her B is worth less than Alexis' A.

They're both in year 12 and almost done with their final exams. Zoe is my stepdaughter if it makes a difference.\n\nWhen it comes to school the girls are opposite. Alexis is like young and dumb me, and chooses to coast on her natural ability. She puts in the minimum yet has amazing grades. Zoe, on the other hand, struggles. She tries extremely hard and is tutored but always struggled to get C's in more academic subjects. To be clear, I'm not saying this to diminish Alexis, I was exactly the same as her back then and she's gotten amazing results. However I have literally never seen her study aside from the literal day of a SAC/exam. I'm proud of her for a lot of things, but her attitude to education just isn't one. Both girls are great even if both have their flaws. So I plan to reward both girls for finishing school and their results/efforts.\n\nThe issue is yesterday Alexis had her math methods exam and Zoe had her business exam. Alexis refused to give more than one word answers as usual, so I left it at saying I'm proud of her and sure she did great. Zoe on the other hand was happy with how it went, telling me she managed to finish and felt really confident on it. Considering last week she was crying because she couldn't finish English (it's designed so most students don't or barely), it was an achievement. I was really proud of her and let her know, making sure to be supportive. However Alexis later got upset and claimed it's not fair that I 'baby' and favour her. She thinks I'm proud of Zoe despite her being worse, so she must be the favourite. Even though I literally told Alexis I was proud of her earlier. I don't agree with her attitude and have tried to motivate her to study, but I'm still proud of the results she's gotten so far. She's valedictorian and I'll eat my hat if she doesn't get into uni. But I'm not going to not be proud of Zoe because she's getting worse results. \n\nAlexis insists that I should be more proud of her, and that it's unfair for Zoe to get the same reward, but thats nonsense. I tried to explain it to her but she just got increasingly more upset, so I told her we'd talk about it more today and tried to assure her I love her. Unfortunately she decided to go to my ex's instead today so we haven't talked beyond my ex accusing me of being a piece of shit father and saying I need to prioritise \"your actual daughter\".\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to reward both. Alexis has better grades but Zoe put in a lot more effort. Both will finish high school in the next two weeks and I'd say they're almost guaranteed to achieve their goals. So both deserve praise and reward. If I had to guess I think it's just my ex being so results-focussed as usual twisting her perspective but it's possible I'm not being as equal as I think. I didn't mean to upset Alexis with this\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. Tell them you are proud of their hard work and accomplishments. I think Alexis will be in for a rude wake up call in Uni when she has zero work ethic and can't coast by any longer.", "NTA. Your daughter is exhibiting an entitled and envious attitude which is not appropriate. The fact that she thinks that her sister deserves less praise simply because her grades aren\u2019t as good is so selfish and self-centered. We all learn at different speeds and in different capacities and I respect that you try and make both of your daughters feel proud over their personal accomplishments. Your daughter needs a reality check.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place. The biggest problem is that they\u2019re graduating at the same time. I think if they were graduating at different years, there\u2019d be considerably less comparison.\n\nI think you do need to have a 1-on-1 conversation with Alexis about not wanting her step sister to feel bad. Literally, every kid at that school will have parents who celebrate their graduation. Zoe should not be the exception. Maybe find out how Alexis would handle the situation in your shoes. Even if Alexis doesn\u2019t want to talk, you need to.\n\nWhile this wasn\u2019t addressed in post, I\u2019m wondering what the custody situation is? It\u2019s just if Zoe spends more time with you than Alexis it could be leading to resentment. You mentioned you see Zoe as a daughter, but if Alexis doesn\u2019t see her that way it could be leading to friction. Maybe Alexis needs more 1-on-1 time with you.", "You are correct for wanting to acknowledge both girls accomplishments, and seem to understand that the accomplishments are different.  Alexis's academic achievement and Zoe's effort.  However, YTA for not understanding how much Alexis might be struggling with your blended family.  If you are spending all of this time helping Zoe (which is needed), are you making the same kind of time for just Alexis?  She might be seeing you spend all of this time with Zoe, sing Zoe's praises for getting average grades, and are very involved on a more regular basis with Zoe, and might feel as if you do NOT view her as being as important as Zoe.  \n\nWhatever the underlying problem in your relationship with Alexis is, you should be very concerned that she is about to graduate and there won't be near as much time for you to try to make your relationship with her better.  As it stands, Alexis's mother will be making a lot bigger deal about her being valedictorian than what you are planning, she will feel that her mother values her more than you, and eventually, she will probably be no or low contact with you.", "I think NAH.", "YTA\n\nBased on what you said you do seem to favour Zoe based on how you talk about her. You call Alexis lazy and dumb, that's not positive things to say about her. It's like you almost resent her for being naturally gifted. How do you know how much she does study? She may not study as much as your other daughter, but she doesn't need to so she spends less hours doing it. I don't know if that makes her lazy. You're not acknowledging her achievments as special. Even though she is doing really well, and you should celebrate that. \n\nYou can still reward Zoe but maybe reward Alexis a little more. She's valedictorian and has all this extra stuff you're not really giving any attention to. \n\nNow she may struggle in uni when she has to really study", "NTA \n\nMy 18 year old is a honors student who gets A's without even trying. \n\nMy 17 year old just coasts by with A's and B's...

She gets C's in her classes and works her butt off to get those. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf my 18 or 17 year old got C's I would be annoyed, because I know they didn't try at all.

The way I\u2019ve always discussed school with them is that it\u2019s not about marks, but instead effort. After every test, i ask them did they do everything possible and work hard to do as well as they can do - if so, then whatever they achieve is amazing, whatever the mark is, but first the effort must be there. With my older nephew, we have set up during the Term 3 holidays, a study schedule for Term 4 and he has stuck to it really well. I\u2019ve given him tips on focusing during the studying which he has been following, and he is coming into yr11 exams feeling confident. \nNTA - rewarding effort is what will set them up for success in the future", "YTA. You complain about your daughter giving you one word answers and then when she does open up to you you shut her down and say you\u2019ll talk about it later.

I also would get upset when my sister got the same as me but now I get it. I'm not more intelligent, my brain is just wired for the school environment. I remember facts, I know how to give teachers what they want, I can bullshit. That doesn't make me better.", "While on one hand I would prefer her not have to go through a harsh awakening, I definitely wish she could see that. I got hit like a truck with work and uni. I definitely hope she can develop a work ethic.\n\nI've always tried to treat them equally. I love them both.", "I am in the same boat. I could study on the day of or day before the exam and get good results. For me the awakening happened when I started to work.", "This- Alexis is in for a nasty shock if she\u2019s going into tertiary education. The higher you go, the more work you have to put in- research, labs, projects etc. It\u2019s no longer read and remember, and spit out facts for exams. I knew a lot of people like Alexis- most of them struggled when it came to thesis work because they were so used to everything coming to them easily.", "I am not sure OP has a realistic idea of the amount of effort his daughter is putting in. I am not sure if it is because she doesn't live there full time or some other reason.\n\nStudents who are valedictorian are not, \"typical lazy teen\"s , she is not coasting and putting in minimal effort. She may not deserve more of a reward but she doesn't deserve to be called lazy and her accomplishments should not be dismissed as low effort.", "I left it at that because she was giving one word answers. When she doesn't communicate it's like drawing blood from a stone, so I left our conversation at the I'm proud of her stuff. Zoe was actively talking and responded so we had the conversation. Obviously a longer conversation I can say more. It's not about being more proud, it's that only one girl was talking to me.\n\nI don't quite understand the last sentence, sorry.", "That makes sense but it's only because she wouldn't talk. When she's giving one word answers it's hard to really talk about all this. Obviously I want her to know I'm proud and support her, so I still said it. But ugh, if that's it it's so frustrating.", "That's why I tried to explain its not meant that diminish. But its pretty standard laziness, not wanting to put in effort in thing (school, chores, basically anything she's not interested in). Like I said I'm not judging that because I was the same. All kids have imperfections, it doesn't mean I think little of them.\n\nAlso I didn't call her dumb. I just mean she was how I was before I grew up. Perhaps the figure of speech is less common where you're from though.\n\nAnd it doesn't inherently need effort. I certainly didn't put any in, and unfortunately Alexis takes after high school me. From what she's said and I've seen, she does the minimum required work but does really well on the SACs (the graded tests).", "I agree she's got great achievement. She is being rewarded and I do try to make sure to let her how proud I am. I just think both deserve attention for their achievements, rather than thinking one deserves it more.", "Yep. There are tons of really smart kids who don't put in the effort and coast through. They are usually b students who don't take the more difficult classes.\n\nA person on track to be valedictorian  earned their grades. Sure, natural intelligence helps, but there had to have been work and effort put in.\n\nOP is the AH for not recognizing that. Sure they may say good job, and that they are proud, their whole attitude, though, is, \"I am proud of you but...\".\n\nThat \"but it is easier\" negates everything else said. \n\nI feel bad for both kids.", "I've repeatedly tried to explain that. But as a typical lazy teen (no shame, I definitely was), Alexis doesn't really like that idea when she can coast instead. I have tried hard to talk and develop study habits, but I can't really force her to study in a meaningful way. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets the same kick I did, but I've definitely tried to help her avoid it.\n\nI didn't consider therapy, but I suppose it's certainly an option.", "Yeah she is, I said that in the third sentence. And since she was 6.", "I very much disagree with that philosophy. Effort and ethic are (imo) more important than mere results. In practice ignoring results doesn't work, but that doesn't mean effort shouldn't be rewarded.", "Different people have different needs and different capabilities. You cant treat someone the same way as one person and call it equality because let\u2019s say (for example)  1 kid eats more and one eats less and you feed them both the same amount (which could leave one hungry) and call it \u2018fair and equal\u2019 when its not.\n\nWhat i\u2019m saying is equity to equality y\u2019know? I think thats where OP is coming from but there also needs to be better communication between them as a family.", "I mean what do you suggest instead of equal? \n\nReward Zoe less and say grades are all that matter? That all her effort is meaningless compared to natural ability?\n\nReward Zoe more because Alexis doesn't put in effort? On a philosophical level I'd say trying and struggling is more worthy of praise than coasting. But in practise that would just demotivate Alexis and defeat the point of it.", "Agree on this - and teenagers REALLY want to be individuals. Alexis probably prides herself on her intelligence, and there are probably other areas (maybe social?) she sees Zoe thrive in and reap rewards from which she doesn't because the \"reward\" isn't so direct. You can recognise the strengths of EACH, it doesn't mean you have to make them feel \"equal\" in every domain.", "I wouldn't agree I want her to have comeuppance. \n\nI just have personal experience getting hit like a rock when I couldn't coast anymore. And I don't want her to go through that.\n\nThere's zero chance she would do that, she is barely willing to do her required work let alone more. I don't mean that in a bad way, not everyone likes school whether they do well in it or not.", "What a shitty suggestion. \u201cGrading\u201d her on whether or not she\u2019s ok with her stepsister being rewarded for accomplishing less than her in school is dumb.

It's probably more my ex than anything, but with how upset Alexis was I was worried I may have misjudged somewhere along the line.", "Honestly? When it\u2019s a kid with natural ability who hasn\u2019t ever had the need to study properly? It\u2019s unfortunate but it is always a harsh learning curve that hits them like a truck. There will be that one test that they think they\u2019ve \u201caced\u201d\u2026 They will get it returned and realise that they\u2019ve done really poorly. They\u2019ll question why they did poorly and have the realisation that coasting isn\u2019t going to cut it any more. It\u2019s up to them at that point to buckle down\u2026 I honestly hope she gets that work ethic down as well. \n\nIf you want?

I\u2019m also terrible at complicated maths and lack creative skills. \n\nBut there are still things I\u2019ve struggled with- the thing about school is that the class tends to move at the pace of the middle to low scoring kids. The repetition makes it a no brainer for children who find academics easy. At uni they don\u2019t really care if you pass or fail and the class moves at the pace necessary to finish the content, of which there is a lot. I also think that kids develop cognitively at different rates, and once that development is finished the differences begin to even out. \n\nThe advantage of being a more \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d kid academically is that they have to actually figure out HOW to learn.

Anyone you see a lot of favoritism on here. This isn't that. This is just being proud of how well one did & how hard one worked. NTA", "NTA \n\nThe goal for both girls was to graduate from high school and go to college.  \n\nDid they both achieve that? Then they both get the award.", "I smell self fulfilling prophecy here", "NTA.  Alexis and Zoe should both be proud of their achievements, as should you.  It's not like you're ignoring Alexis or refusing to acknowledge her achievements so there's no problem with you giving encouragement to Zoe as well.  On a side note, Alexis is going to eventually learn, the easy way I hope, that natural ability itself will only take you so far.  Eventually, in order to be successful, motivation and hard work have to take over.  In that regard Zoe may actually have one up on Alexis.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a case of you giving Alexis a twenty dollar gift voucher for some gift shop she doesn\u2019t even like for passing her exam with flying colours whilst Zoe got to pick a restaurant of her choice to celebrate how she did in her exam regardless of what her end result for it was. You told both girls you were proud of them in ways that acknowledged their individual achievements without any unnecessary or demeaning comparisons being made between the two of them.\n\nAlexis has no right to be mad about anything and I find it incredibly amusing that she has the gall to claim you baby Zoe, yet the very first thing she does is run off to her mum so she can cry about how you don\u2019t love her because you didn\u2019t pretend Zoe had nothing to be proud of and validate her when she tried to demean her stepsister.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. But you do seem to speak more negatively of your daughter, even though she\u2019s a valedictorian. I understand that you want her to study and work hard. Things are only going to get more difficult as life goes on but you\u2019re also diminishing her achievements, because she doesn\u2019t have to work hard for them.", "NTA but as someone who used to be a teenage girl not too long ago I understand her being upset about op seemingly favouring a step child. How long have you been a step dad. It wouldn\u2019t be fair treating a step daughter equal if it a not too long ago thing. Because kinda diminishes her importance putting another child same value as someone whose been your daughter her whole life. I know I\u2019ll get hate for it but that\u2019s how teenager think and their feelings and thoughts are valid to them.", "All three of my kids have done well academically but my younger two are considered gifted.  I have told both of them that they are very lucky to be smart but they cannot be conceited about it.  Their intelligence is something that they both lucked out on and were given.  It wasn't earned.  It just is.\n\nHaving said that, I do praise them for their hard work and commitment to their studies.  THAT is something within their control.  That is what I focus on.\n\nAlexis sounds like she doesn't put any effort in at all, so she is wanting to be rewarded for the intelligence she is lucky enough to have, but didn't actually earn.  On the other hand, Zoe has actually done something, and done something really difficult.\n\nI used to be a teacher, and years later, I still remember one student who was the hardest working student I ever met.  That kid tried so hard, yet it was very rare that he got more than a C.  It killed me to have to give that kind of grade when I knew what kind of effort he went to.\n\nYou may find that the girls do quite differently in later education.  Whilst both of my younger kids are extremely smart, my son used to coast all through primary school.  He just never needed to make an effort.  On the other hand, my daughter had to work a bit harder.  She learned how to learn.  We warned our son that coasting would not work in high school, and he understood but it still took a couple of years for the real understanding to kick in.  Now they are about to start their final year of high school, and my daughter achieves significantly higher than my son, and I think a lot of it is that she learned how to learn effectively and got really good habits.  My son tries much harder now, but doesn't achieve the same.\n\nAll that work Zoe has put in will stand her in good stead either in further education, or her working life.  She may not have the same grades, but she has learned a lot of other things like work ethic and best ways to maximise her learning.  This will show through.\n\nPlease tell Zoe this.", "Dude, YTA\n\nNot for the praise but how you describe this.\n\nIf you can get Aces without studying it would be dumb on so many levels to bother studying.  Also some people don\u2019t like attention on certain things or unknowns.  I never celebrated a test or felt a way about it until I got results.  \n\nYou absolutely need to find a way to teach A about celebrating effort when needed, without slamming the lack *when it\u2019s not needed*.  The way you word this really sounds like significantly slight to A for not needing to study, she\u2019s feeling that.  Also she may work harder than you realize but isn\u2019t the type to talk about it\n\nAlso You reward them both but maybe you aren\u2019t doing it in a way that meets individual needs..  One may thrive one words of affirmation while another on getting small gifts, so if you only do one form there\u2019s a gap.  \n\nI think your intention is good but you\u2019re missing more nuances in their personality", "it's hard to want to put in effort when you know you'll be treated the same as someone who didn't perform as well.", "Honestly that may never happen.  Even honors classes in Uni were ridiculously easy.", "I totally agree with you.  It was the same here.  Not only did it totally hurt my relationship with my mom, but I have developed performance anxiety as a result since I grew up feeling that anything other than perfect was not good enough (and even perfection was nothing to be proud of, since it was expected and I didn\u2019t have to work hard at it). \n\nI never hit that wall that other \u201cgifted\u201d kids hit later in life.  I never had to study other than listen in class, and doing the required work never took long.  So OP I really hope you realize what a special kid Alexis is.  Her \u201cdumb\u201d mistakes might also be a way to get your attention since you only seems to value imperfection and provide feedback at that moment.  \n\nBoth kids should be rewarded but not equally and not at the same time.  Let Alexis shine as valedictorian.", "But you don\u2019t. You praise Zoe and then praise Alexis however there is always a negative For Alexis. Why can\u2019t you just accept that alexis is great and leave it at that. Why bring her up then drag her down?", "Yep. I even got told by a HS teacher that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get away with being smart forever\u201d and damn it he was right. \n\nAt some point you have to learn to actually study and it\u2019s so much harder at uni when everyone who struggled in high school already have it down. \n\nIt would be incredibly unfair just to reward the child with better results and not the child who actually put the effort in.", ">I got hit like a truck with work and uni.\n\nI can relate. I coasted through high school and got into a top school. The minute I got there I found out that I was suddenly in the bottom half of ability. I had to learn how to properly study otherwise I would have failed out. She's going to get a rude awakening but you have to continue to encourage her to develop a work ethic so that the transition isn't so terrible. My parents did that for me even through high school when I didn't need to study so I was able finally listen to their words when I needed them so I finally developed that work ethic.", "the education is not the issue here. Your daughter is for some reason feeling maginalised. look into your level of praise.", "Your a good mom. Kids are different and should be treated the same.", "I mean, you can coast and still do well. From OP's post I'm pretty sure I went through the same system as their kids, and I not only topped my school but the state with zero work. Got slapped down in my first year of a top five US college because I had no idea how to work. I figured it out and did well eventually, but man that first year was a huge reality check.", "So because you couldn\u2019t handle it you think she will fail. What a way to give encouragement. My kids had dreams and no matter how much I knew that is what they were, I NEVER told them they would probably fail or discourage or talk them down. \n\nI told them I would do whatever I could to help them and encourage them.", "Then tell me... What was I supposed to do to actually get praise? I did study. It was just never seen. You can't get all As without studying even a little.", "you're all projecting hard.", "/u/3570526 just want the videos in this course:[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\n...you can probably skim them all in a day or so, and then you'll know the \"tricks\" for learning that come from all the brain science (so far).\n\nVery interesting.  \n\n\n(The developers I knew who worked at Coursera - making their mobile apps - said this was the favorite course in the office.)", "What are you talking about? He never said that.", "You absolutely can if you just paid attention in class. I got them that way.", "Unfortunately you absolutely can. I got straight As through high school and graduated 4th in my class. I can tell you I never studied once. College was a rude awakening for me and it was wild trying to figure out how to study at 18-19 years old.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he would really care. As long as Zoe\u2019s there he\u2019ll be fine", "I mentioned is specifically because he mentioned she struggled with staying on task and doing things she\u2019s not interested in. You can well in school and still have ADHD. People with adhd are frequently accused of being lazy. What is manageable her her now could easily become unmanageable when she loves out for the first time. I see this more as a \u201c I think we should look into this to help you because I want you to thrive in college\u201d than saying she is broken and needs fixing.", "He didn't say anything to her. He wrote it to us, in the post.", "my issue is that zoe is not talked about negatively but Alexis is talked about very negatively she is smart but\u2026..  if he would stop at smart but he doesn\u2019t. He praises zoes achievements but talks more about Alexis faults.", "And he was comparing his daughter to himself who he called young and dumb that\u2019s what he thinks of her and if you don\u2019t think that he doesn\u2019t come across like that to Alexis then you don\u2019t understand teenagers.\n\nThe problem is in his whole post he talks negatively about his own daughter but doesn\u2019t say anything negative about Zoe.  He has no faith in his own daughter that\u2019s the problem and it comes across to Alexis that way.", "Again I understand why that's your perception but if you don't see why I see it differently, I don't think I could ever explain it to you because I don't know how to express it any better than I already have.", "If you wanna go in circles, see my previous comments."]}
