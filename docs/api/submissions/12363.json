The family have had them since last year and I started working for the family in Feb.\n\nThe other day the daughter came to me and said \u201cWE need to go pick up poo, my mom said you must help me.\u201d I was a bit taken aback because surely I\u2019m not needed for such? It can be a one man job and the daughter is old enough to do it. Anyway, reluctantly I did it with her and showed her a quick and easier way of getting it done.\n\nThe next day, the same story. I told her that I\u2019m sure she knows how to do it after yesterday and doesn\u2019t need me. After a lot of hesitation and procrastinating from her, she went outside and I held the bag open. \n\nNow, again yesterday before taking the dogs for a walk she said we have to pick up poo. I said \u201cOh, but we did it yesterday? Isn\u2019t it your brothers turn?\u201d She said \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d He actually sits and plays video games and doesn\u2019t even walk the dogs with us. Not once have I seen him picking up the \ud83d\udca9.\n\nShe then says, \u201cif we are going to take the dogs for a walk then we need to pick up poo.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d really like to bring this up with the mom as I really don\u2019t believe this falls under my list of responsibilities and unfair that I have to be involved but her son isn\u2019t? \n\nI do have five dogs of my own and pick up after them everyday. It\u2019s unfortunately one of the things that comes with owning dogs. \n\nBefore I go to the mom (I hate confrontation), am I wrong for thinking this isn\u2019t part of my job and I shouldn\u2019t have to be a part of it?", "created_utc": 1678879428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rtio0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_the_child_i_aupair/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are making you a dog walker for free when they are paying you for looking after the child. Do take it up with the parent that you aren't going to walk their dogs and they need to find someone else to do it. Also do make it clear that the dog is not your responsibility and if the child isn't trained to take care of the dog poo, then its her problem to deal with it. Also refuse to go walking with the dog to avoid the situation as a 10 year old is well capable of cleaning up after the dog and their reluctance to do it is not your responsibility. Leave the dog at home or stay at home.", "NTA. Your responsibility is to take care of the children, nothing else.", "Info: what was discussed regarding taking care of the dogs when you were hired?", "NTA.

Usually there is a line about what duties are and are not included, and I thought most specifically cover pet care.  For example, I wouldn't expect an au-pair to groom a pet or feed a pet unless it was specifically covered in the contract.  Usually there is a note about \"light housework\".\n\nWhere I debate a little is that if you're out with the child and playing with the dog who poops, it feels like you should/could probably help tidy up after the dog.  If you showed up at the house and they handed you a bag saying \"clean the poop out of the yard\", that's a hard no.\n\nI don't think it would hurt to help, but if you absolutely don't want to, you're probably in your rights not to.", "NTA. You\u2019re a baby sitter, not a dog walker or dog shit scooper. They should know how to pick up their own dog\u2019s shit, they\u2019re old enough to figure it out and don\u2019t need you to do it. It shouldn\u2019t have to be a hard chore to pick up your own dog\u2019s feces and throw it away. \n\n  But question tho on the \u201cI held the bag open\u201d are y\u2019all picking it up with your bare hands or\u2026 bc usually ppl flip the bag inside out and pick it up *with* the bag. Just wondering lol.", "NTA asking nannies to pick up extra housework without extra pay is pretty common. Don't start doing more than you agreed to unless you want it to continue happening. \n\nIt would be worth clarifying with the mom exactly who is supposed to be picking up after the dogs in the yard and when. That way it's not a he said/she said when you tell the daughter that she needs to do her own chores.", "NTA.  Au Pair is child care, not doggy care.", "I would be very surprised if their mother actually told her that you are supposed to do it for her. NTA, unless your actual employer asked you to do this and it\u2019s within the scope of your agreement. That hasn\u2019t happened.", "NTA. \n\n> I hate confrontation\n\nThe personal mantra of 90% of the people who post on here. \n\nThis isn't a confrontation. This is an au pair confirming something with their employer that a child informed them about. This is you being a 24 year old adult and fact checking something that one of your kids told you their parents said, which was new to you.", "Info, I'm not 100% sure based on your wording - are you talking about cleaning up after the dog while out for a walk in the neighborhood, or cleaning up the backyard of the house?

Yeah that\u2019s a little different. Huh. I really don\u2019t know if you should be responsible for that.

I really appreciate it.", "[deleted]", "They aren\u2019t the smallest dogs and it\u2019s not the biggest yard.
