If you're not willing to do that, you will be TA. For the record, I only say this would be a reasonable thing to gently bring up because this is something she could quickly rectify with a 5-minute trim. She wouldn't need to shave, only trim to whatever length is both comfortable and suitable. It's not like you're asking her to color her hair (head or otherwise). \n\nIf you do approach her about it, you should be clear that you will absolutely not change her place in the wedding regardless.\n\nAll of that said... I don't think I would make this request. If she's in your wedding party, you can accept her as-is without it putting a damper on your evening or photos. And if it really was somehow that much of a bother... I'd rather just pay for the editing.", "Buy her a jacket, wrap, or something to cover.

Be prepared for her to react poorly if you decide to ask.", "YWBTA-I don't think you should even ask. You knew about her body choices when you asked her to be in your wedding party.

For someone who never does it, shaving could cause her itching, redness, and discomfort that either throws off your photos anyway or makes it difficult for her to enjoy your wedding and focus on you as your bridesmaid. A simpler solution that doesn't attempt an infringement on her bodily autonomy would be to find a cute, formal bolero or shrug to wear over her dress. It doesn't even need to be solid/opaque.

Why does it matter to you so much to make your sister attractive to your fiance and his family exactly???\n\nAlso whatever editor you hired that would charge you hundreds of dollars to photoshop out some hints of armpit hair is ripping you off and that's on you.

There are other suggestions you can make like trimming the hair so it isn\u2019t visible as much or wearing something that would cover the hair if she doesn\u2019t want to shave.

I also don't think that anyone owes it to another person to be pretty or attractive. \n\nThat said.

That's pretty healthy and mature so kudos to you.", "I think YWBTA for asking her to shave. Even if she agreed to do it, she may end up with irritated skin or ingrown hairs.

Why can\u2019t she just look like your sister? \n\nIf you find her body hair truly so disgusting that you must cover it for your wedding, you should make her change the style of her dress to cover her pits. If she\u2019s already chosen and paid for her first dress that means you will need to pay for a second one, since you already told her she could pick what she wanted and you now want to override it. But it\u2019s not okay for you to ask her to shave because you find her body unattractive. \n\nI just don\u2019t get how people don\u2019t want their friends and family to actually be represented in their wedding photos. When you and your friends and family look at your wedding pictures in the future, don\u2019t you want them to say \u201cOh look, there\u2019s Susie\u201d and not \u201cWhoa, who\u2019s this photoshopped person who kind of looks like Susie?

You will only become an asshole here if:\n\n1. You force her to shave; or\n2.

You\u2019d never see a man wearing a sleeveless top bearing armpit hair at a wedding either.** If she didn\u2019t want to shave, she shouldn\u2019t have chosen a dress that requires shaving. \n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s fine to ask her to give her the option of shaving or switching to a more appropriate dress. Imo it\u2019s the same as asking a man to neaten up his unkept beard before the wedding - you shouldn\u2019t have to ask because they should just do it, but they shouldn\u2019t be offended if you do ask politely. I have a few friends who don\u2019t shave their arms or legs, but they do shave for formal events.\n\nA lot of people are just voting based on whether they personally are ok with body hair which is weird. \n\n**The reason sleeveless tops aren\u2019t formal wear for men is *because* they don\u2019t shave.
