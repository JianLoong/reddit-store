If you're not willing to do that, you will be TA. For the record, I only say this would be a reasonable thing to gently bring up because this is something she could quickly rectify with a 5-minute trim. She wouldn't need to shave, only trim to whatever length is both comfortable and suitable. It's not like you're asking her to color her hair (head or otherwise). \n\nIf you do approach her about it, you should be clear that you will absolutely not change her place in the wedding regardless.\n\nAll of that said... I don't think I would make this request. If she's in your wedding party, you can accept her as-is without it putting a damper on your evening or photos. And if it really was somehow that much of a bother... I'd rather just pay for the editing.", "Buy her a jacket, wrap, or something to cover.

Be prepared for her to react poorly if you decide to ask.", "YWBTA-I don't think you should even ask. You knew about her body choices when you asked her to be in your wedding party.

For someone who never does it, shaving could cause her itching, redness, and discomfort that either throws off your photos anyway or makes it difficult for her to enjoy your wedding and focus on you as your bridesmaid. A simpler solution that doesn't attempt an infringement on her bodily autonomy would be to find a cute, formal bolero or shrug to wear over her dress. It doesn't even need to be solid/opaque.

I also don't think that anyone owes it to another person to be pretty or attractive. \n\nThat said.

That's pretty healthy and mature so kudos to you.", "I think YWBTA for asking her to shave. Even if she agreed to do it, she may end up with irritated skin or ingrown hairs.

Why can\u2019t she just look like your sister? \n\nIf you find her body hair truly so disgusting that you must cover it for your wedding, you should make her change the style of her dress to cover her pits. If she\u2019s already chosen and paid for her first dress that means you will need to pay for a second one, since you already told her she could pick what she wanted and you now want to override it. But it\u2019s not okay for you to ask her to shave because you find her body unattractive. \n\nI just don\u2019t get how people don\u2019t want their friends and family to actually be represented in their wedding photos. When you and your friends and family look at your wedding pictures in the future, don\u2019t you want them to say \u201cOh look, there\u2019s Susie\u201d and not \u201cWhoa, who\u2019s this photoshopped person who kind of looks like Susie?

You will only become an asshole here if:\n\n1. You force her to shave; or\n2.

Imo it\u2019s the same as asking a man to neaten up his unkept beard before the wedding - you shouldn\u2019t have to ask because they should just do it, but they shouldn\u2019t be offended if you do ask politely. I have a few friends who don\u2019t shave their arms or legs, but they do shave for formal events.\n\nA lot of people are just voting based on whether they personally are ok with body hair which is weird. \n\n**The reason sleeveless tops aren\u2019t formal wear for men is *because* they don\u2019t shave.

However, this will only comes across as you telling your sister that you think her body is disgusting. You can control a lot of things about your wedding, but this is a small thing to fixate on and could be seen as invasive or insulting. Consider this: if one of your older female relatives had a mustache or chin hair, would you approach them and ask them to shave because it\u2019s unsightly for photos? Would you request that all of your guests lose ten pounds before they show up to your wedding because being overweight is unattractive and you don\u2019t want them to ruin the photos?", "This is not an either/or.

It\u2019s possible this would fit within whatever standard retouching they are including in your package. Worth checking if photos are the primary concern.

We told our groomsmen that shaving wasn\u2019t needed, just make sure it looks clean/neat. I think the same logic can apply to your sister\u2014no shaving necessary, just make sure it looks clean/neatly trimmed.", "NTA I feel like it would be sloppy for a man to wear something that showed his armpit hair pushing out.

Maybe get her a long sleeve dress instead if she doesn\u2019t want to trim the ferrets in her armpits.", "NTA I think the bride and groom have the right to behave, to an extent, a little like divas.

Lol", "Going against the grain here but YWNBTA.\n\nCan people stop pretending that armpit hair on display would not bring attraction from other guests? It may even end up being the discussion during the wedding and this may ruin the experience for OP. A certain amount of hair on the body is ok, no one said it wasn\u2019t, however when you have a literal bush sticking out of your arm when it is not even raised, you have an issue here. Armpit hair makes your body odour smell way worse as the hair traps the smell, which would raise another issue of her smelling bad during the wedding and no one wants that. \n\nI think the issue here is, you cannot ask her to shave as she clearly will refuse even if it is your big day and I do agree with commenters that that isn\u2019t really your right to ask. However, what you can ask of her (which is more than appropriate) is to wear a shawl/overcoat that matches with her dress so it doesn\u2019t look out of place and she doesn\u2019t have to shave. I believe if she refuses even that then there is an issue of her just being annoying and wanting to be the centre of attention. Especially if she understands that this is your wedding and this is the only favour you\u2019re asking of her.", "I don't understand how the top two comments are negotiating with OP and calling her N T A.

Ok, thanks.\u201d  There\u2019s no polite way to make a rude request.", "She's not demanding anything, she would ask her politely. The armpit hair won't be visible on the men as they'll be wearing suits.", "I think you're wrong. If the armpit hair of men were visible it would be equally bad. \n\nThe only places it would be ok to run around with armpit hair would be the beach or park etc. \n\nBut a special occasion where people have to dress up and take extra care of their appearance is not the place where you can go unshaved.

OP seems very considerate of her sisters choices. That being said, it is OPs wedding and they\u2019re not cheap. It would be totally unacceptable for a man to have his armpit hair showing at a formal event, not sure why everyone is equating armpit hair to men\u2019s facial hair? If OPs Sister had a bit of a mustache going on I think it would be super rude to confront her about that, but armpit hair? Wear a dress that covers it and don\u2019t give your sister who is getting married something to be upset about in her wedding photos that she\u2019s spending thousands on. Imo if the sister had an issue with this, she\u2019s the AH. Just trim the hair or wear a different dress. Or some type of cover up or scarf to wear during pics. I don\u2019t think this is a huge ask by any means. Asking her to flat out shave might be a bit much, but covering up the hair in general just for the pics does not make OP an AH.
