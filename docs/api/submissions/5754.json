If you're not willing to do that, you will be TA. For the record, I only say this would be a reasonable thing to gently bring up because this is something she could quickly rectify with a 5-minute trim. She wouldn't need to shave, only trim to whatever length is both comfortable and suitable. It's not like you're asking her to color her hair (head or otherwise). \n\nIf you do approach her about it, you should be clear that you will absolutely not change her place in the wedding regardless.\n\nAll of that said...

Imo it\u2019s the same as asking a man to neaten up his unkept beard before the wedding - you shouldn\u2019t have to ask because they should just do it, but they shouldn\u2019t be offended if you do ask politely.

I think I still come down on team YWBTA though?\n\nI personally don\u2019t see body hair as a big deal though.", "OP isn\u2019t demanding just asking", "Weddings are typically formal dress codes, and body hair on anyone isn't very formal. As others have pointed out, the men's body hair will be covered.", "She isn't, read the post again please.", "yep bumping! NTA", "It's not the same thing. Like, at all. How many tops on men don't naturally cover their armpits? It's not like wife beaters are common wedding attire.\n\nMost bridesmaid dresses I've seen in real life have straps, not sleeves (short or otherwise).\n\nRidiculous comparison.", "Bruh dont expect women to cover their armpit or even shave them for you or for people. Their body, not your choice", "I\u2019m with you here. NTA.", "That just makes seem, at best, that you honor her choices but you're criticizing specifically her grooming.", "She's requesting a hairstyle. The hairstyle of her sister's pits.", "That's all op is thinking of doing", "This sounds very contrived. Just be straightforward and genuine", "Ugh I had a free award and I already gave it away otherwise it would have gone to you! This is the perfect suggestion! \n\nShe can say she wanted to have a unifying item of clothing for the photos and they can\u2019t complain. She shouldn\u2019t say anything at all to her sister about her armpit hair. Just make it about wanting to have the pashmina featured.", "This is the best suggestion I've read on this thread.", "Still going to hard to find in the group photos unless OP plans to blow them up life size.", "I\u2019m sorry, this comment has me giggling to myself in bed right now trying not to wake my boyfriend, I love it", "But a model gets paid. If she pays here fine", "Similarly, if a groomsman had a huge unkempt beard, plenty of brides would want them to shave/tidy that up for a wedding", "I don't get how people dont find it a big deal. I find underarm hair *viscerally* gross, on men and women and nonbinary folks and myself. It's all equally gross to me, underarms are sweaty and all that sweat is getting mixed up with *hair* and I'm grossing myself out just thinking about it. So I get the ask, for a wedding, to shave or cover it.\n\nBut even with my strong reaction, normally that is my business and the business of anyone I date. Other people should have their body hair any way they please, even if I don't like it. Their body, their business.", "Yeah I imagine the men with hair will be in full shirts. The bridesmaid couldve chosen a pink dress with sleeves or even an off the shoulder look to be considerate of the bride on her special day. It\u2019s sort of like washing your hair, maybe you don\u2019t normally wash on that day of the week but it\u2019s someone else\u2019s wedding and day and the last thing any one should want is for their hygiene to be a topic of discussion (regardless if it\u2019s sexist or not). \n\nAt minimum OP, I\u2019d ask her to trim? I assume that\u2019s a thing\u2026 at least trim to a length that doesn\u2019t stick out with her arms by her side/carrying flowers.", "So if the men's arms will show then they should shave their arms right? Since bodyhair is apparently \"not formal\" \\*eyeroll\\*", "REMOVE THOSE EYEBROWS, YOU SLOVEN.", "Body hair is independent of the hairstyle I'm talking about and you know it. Hair on the top of one's head is the only thing a bride could maybe have control over, and that is only with enthusiastic consent.", "That we need to see!", "she gets to be involved in something a lot of people don\u2019t get the chance for. if she wants to be a bridesmaid trimming her armpit hair isn\u2019t the worst thing ever", "Tidy up? Maybe. Shave? Back off. People are weird with how they overstep on a person's body. It's not ok.", "I have to agree. Personally, I do not appreciate how armpit hair looks and how stinky it looks like it smells. But I know that this is my issue to deal with, so I would never ask anyone to shave their armpits to appease me. But I think it's okay to acknowledge that some of us do not like the way armpit hair looks.", "Fascinating! I suppose I don\u2019t see it as too different to the hair on my head, and tbh on partners (I date men) I often find it sexy", "Agree.  And yet, only women are expected to shave it.  It's so very sexist.  That said, I don't think this is too big of an ask.  But it's also something that can be worked around with a jacket or the bride offering to buy a dress with sleeves.", "Shaving body hair doesn't mean less hygiene tho unlike washing yourself obviously, what ?? That's the worst comparison I've read about that", "She may have honestly not thought about it! Sounds like they haven\u2019t spoken about it yet, and the sister may well see it as a true nonissue", "Sorry I'm half asleep and didn't pick up on that before your reply and edit.", "Its still asshole behavior to hold this over her. Like either the hair or being a bridesmaid. Imo she can do that, still YTA tho\n\nNot that OP said this ultimatum. Just responding to your comment", "Well OP seems to mostly care as the armpit hair is visible even when the arms are by her side, so a tidy up would mean you\u2019d only see the hair if her arms were above her head", "i respectfully disagree. i dont think she\u2019s the AH and if she goes about the situation correctly all will be resolved"]}
