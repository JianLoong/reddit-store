If you're not willing to do that, you will be TA. For the record, I only say this would be a reasonable thing to gently bring up because this is something she could quickly rectify with a 5-minute trim. She wouldn't need to shave, only trim to whatever length is both comfortable and suitable. It's not like you're asking her to color her hair (head or otherwise). \n\nIf you do approach her about it, you should be clear that you will absolutely not change her place in the wedding regardless.\n\nAll of that said... I don't think I would make this request. If she's in your wedding party, you can accept her as-is without it putting a damper on your evening or photos.

Why can\u2019t she just look like your sister? \n\nIf you find her body hair truly so disgusting that you must cover it for your wedding, you should make her change the style of her dress to cover her pits. If she\u2019s already chosen and paid for her first dress that means you will need to pay for a second one, since you already told her she could pick what she wanted and you now want to override it.

Imo it\u2019s the same as asking a man to neaten up his unkept beard before the wedding - you shouldn\u2019t have to ask because they should just do it, but they shouldn\u2019t be offended if you do ask politely.

I guess my question is what's more important to you, your sister being at your wedding or your sister being attractive? By all means ask your sister if she would mind shaving for this one occasion or wear something to cover the hair, but be prepared that she might not like that question and that you might not see her at your wedding. Your priorities are your own and if you'd rather your sister not be at your wedding than her being there looking the way she wants, that's your prerogative.

Make sure whenever you ask her you\u2019re being clear that you don\u2019t have anything against it, it\u2019s just for the pictures and you\u2019re willing to find a compromise, and she\u2019s not getting removed from the wedding party either way", "You are NOT the asshole.

It's like if somebody tried to tell me that they charge 800 bucks to remove the red eye from the flash of 40 photos. I'd find that ridiculous. \n\nMy main Adobe platforms are Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, and After Effects. I have been learning and working on Adobe platforms since 2007. Photoshop is incredibly sophisticated now. That price may have made sense a number of years ago, nowadays you don't even need something like Adobe to make convincing and well blended touch ups on a tiny bit of hair. If money is the issue for her she could quite literally do it herself if this meant so so much to her.\n\nThere are so many tools in Photoshop now that take care of little details and touch ups like that with a ridiculous amount of ease. It doesn't take any significant amount of time to select a hyper specific selection any more. You can convincingly select, replace and content-aware fill entire backgrounds with a click of a button.\n\nSimple cut outs and touch ups are quickly becoming a cheaper and cheaper line of work because of how efficient our devices can do this for us now. Years ago I would make quick cash on top of my larger jobs by working on platforms like Fiver to offer quick cut-outs of people in photos so it's just an image of the people with a transparent background. iPhone updated just a few days ago where now you literally just tap and hold and it does it for you immediately and it does it very accurately for general purpose use. Thus rendering that service nearly obsolete save for those who don't have access to these devices at all and those who need the highest of quality editing. Why would anybody who has an iphone with that capability pay me 5 dollars to do this service when they have the means right at their fingertips now?\n\nIt would make sense to charge at least hundreds for the overall editing of the overall batch obviously. It doesn't make sense to tack on hundreds of dollars as an \"armpit hair removal fee.\" If the armpit hair is literally the only thing she wants edited in her photos and she's not going to be seeking tons of little touch ups and lighting editing and such then she can do it herself or hire somebody through a platform like Fiver to edit a specific handful that she wants to show to others and save herself from being ripped off and her sister the indignity.", "Don\u2019t even need to trim. Just style it with some gel.", "No they don't. There's not even remotely the same view on men and women's armpit hair by society lmao. Clearly men are not under the same pressure to shave that part as women are and are WAY WAY less likely to be called disgusting for not shaving it. Why do you think there is so many women who shave their armpits compared to men ? \n\nWhich is why this is firmly in YTA category : the sister knows most people find it unattractive, you cannot live in this world and not be aware of this. She *chose* to not shave and will either be very embarrassed or angry if OP bring it up but she will never answer like \"oh I didn't know most people would have a problem with it ! Guess I will shave then to please everyone else but me and contribute even more to the cultural norm of shaming women for their natural body :)\"", "Attractive in the sense of being aesthetically pleasing, not sexually attractive...", "Yes it would be wrong", "Exactly.

Shaving is a personal choice that shouldn\u2019t have to be defended in this day and age.\n\nThere's only something to defend if you perceive as an attack.

Dieting is hard and rarely successful. Dying hair can fuck it up. I wouldn't ask someone to shave a big beard they'd spent a lot of time growing, but I'd ask them to shave stubble. To me, armpit hair falls in that category, especially if covering it is an option. It's also common to have bridesmaids do their hair a certain way, wear a style of dress  they may not normally wear, etc. It is, currently in western culture, always going to involve some compromises on individual style.", "Wait it's not an expectation here you are from that men trim their pit hair back?

And this is coming from a woman who doesn\u2019t shave her armpits - I\u2019m all for fighting social norms but someone else\u2019s wedding photos isn\u2019t an appropriate place for that.", "Body hair has absolutely zero to do with cleanliness.", "I shave my armpits regularly but to this day I still find the feeling of the razor on my skin to be unpleasant, so I would never ask someone to shave just for the aesthetic", "Why not?\n\nAnd I didn't say shave, I said trim. Some guys get one or 3 hairs in their brows that go crazy. I get too much that grows in between my hairline and brows, and over the ridge of my nose. Trim those suckers up and look good.", "Why would she? OP is the one ashamed of her sister\u2019s body hair, not her sister.

You trim the hair on your head for hygienic purposes. Why wouldn't that apply to any other hair on your body.", "Having a well kept beard doesn't have anything to do with cleanliness either.  You're not wrong for asking someone to be well groomed at a wedding.  You're completely reasonable in making the request OP is here, or asking a man to tidy up his beard.", "Just in general, regardless of if you want to shave because of the smell, or would either way, this works for hairy or hairless.\n\nAntibacterial soap. It makes a world of difference.\n\nNow, not for every wash. Just to get to a neutral base. And then, if you notice it coming back and remaining after showering, next shower, use the antibacterial soap again.", "So interesting how different everyone's bodies are. One of the big bonuses of stopping shaving my armpits was the reduction in BO.", "Oh yeah, id have no problem with trimming, in fact I do it myself fairly regularly snyway", "Wouldn't it be just as much of an issue if OP let all her bridesmaids choose their dresses except her sister? The underlying message would still be that the armpits are a problem. Either way, at this point her sister has chosen a dress that will show her armpits so OP can't do anything about the dress now", ">So if some bride doesn't want men with beards in their wedding they should have to shave it off, wouldn't they? it's just hair \ud83d\ude44 \n\nI mean, if the guys were down with it but it's a much bigger ask because a face is more visible than an armpit, generally, and it has a much bigger impact on the face.

There was plenty of room to avoid the situation all together.", "I am very sweaty and do not shave my pits or wear stick deodorant,  but I do a lil spritz of isopropyl alcohol every morning and I'm fine.  Seconding the bacteria- killing", "She could have chosen ALL the dresses. If OP had problems with certain body parts of her bridesmaids, then she shouldn\u2019t have given them the opportunity to choose their dresses. It\u2019s just as discriminatory to ask *one* of your bridesmaids to change *their* body to make it acceptable *to you* in the dress they chose.", "I mean, it would be extremely reasonable to ask someone to trim their beard for a wedding", "I'm fully aware of that but they're usually shaped up. It's also not the same as arm pit hair visibly sticking out at a dressy event. That is tacky AF. Either way that's irrelevant. I never said she needed to shave her pits.

Wear sleeves, wear a jacket. It\u2019s not even hard to compromise. The bride isn\u2019t even demanding she shave.

That is what is meant here.", "I'm hairy and for my brother's wedding I planned on just staying completely covered even on a hot June day.  My mom still tried to force/ guilt me into shaving for NO REASON", "Do you think the sister needing to prioritize a message about what she believes in can be back-burnered for a wedding? If my sister asked me to mildly change my appearance in a reversible fashion I wouldn\u2019t hesitate.", "\ud83d\ude02 this is too real.", "I'd think bringing it up sooner is better. Why wait last minute? Mention it now and give your sister time to either choose a new dress or agree to shave/find another compromise. Waiting until a closer date just seems to cause drama. I don't see it as an unreasonable or rude request. Coming from someone with dark hair who sometimes just doesn't care enough or gets too lazy to shave, I'd just shave or if I had sensitive skin find a way to hide it. If I don't shave my legs, I wear darker tights, if I don't shave my armpits I wear long enough sleeves, not a big deal to accommodate. Everyone saying you shouldn't judge is missing the point. You aren't telling your sister to completely change herself, you're asking her for one day to meet a dress standard that you've set.", "Body hair on others is a real hit topic if you're a boring person.  My mom finds endless opportunities for fun charts w her friends about mine,  I get to hear later,  apropos of nothing \"oh signe was telling me HER NIECE doesn't shave either and everyone could see it on vacation\" life wow that's so cool mom", "If I found out the fiance had been talking about my body in a critical way I'd skip being a bridesmaid entirely. Weird vibes.", "Ya thats the part that bugs me too. Not enough to say OP is the AH but maybe the family should stfu about it cuz if I was the sis and found out these conversations were happening, I'd probably tell them all where to go and how to get there.", "I agree. She said she will not insist.\n\nI think, in 2023, a bridesmaid in a photo with bushy armpit hair would draw attention from the bride in the picture. And I\u2019m a non shaver. \n\nTotally wrong that it\u2019s been discussed behind her back. But I think it\u2019s better to bring it up and ask her to trim, shave, or cover up for the photos rather than sit and stew.

I have two that let it go a few days between shaves. \n\nIf they had beards, I\u2019d ask them to trim and condition.", "I should have been more clear sorry, I didn\u2019t mean that she was ok to demand it being done. But I don\u2019t see the harm in asking politely. If her sister is like me then she will, if she isn\u2019t keen on it she will decline. I don\u2019t think it has to be a huge deal.", "Yeah, but she\u2019s not paying for them. If she orders her own photos,  they can be natural.", "NTA. That was my very first thought. Why are some people so offended about the possibility of a polite request of trimming her armpit bushes? If men wore sleeveless attire to a wedding and had such a big armpit bush that it showed even with their arms down, that would be every bit just as unsightly and worth a request to shave or trim. I mean the vast majority of grown men I\u2019ve known don\u2019t have THAT much visible armpit hair or even any at all when wearing tank tops unless their arms are raised in the air. Sounds like this chic has enough armpit hair to make a small wig if it\u2019s showing like the way it was described. She CHOSE a sleeveless dress. If she doesn\u2019t have enough common sense to trim it on her own for a wedding that bride is paying thousands in pics for then she must be an asshole and an attention seeker just looking to push her agenda and ruffle some feathers at a very inappropriate place and time for it. Might as well hang out both tits to breastfeed while making the moh speech. Same type of attention seeking people aiming for shock value and love of just making people uncomfortable at inappropriate moments.", "A woman's armpit hair is natural and shouldn't be an issue, but that's not the world we live in. If the sister's pits are unusually hairy... to the point where her bush is sticking out from beneath her arms, even in a resting position, people will notice it. Period. Should they keep their judgments to themselves? Yes, but again, that's not the world we live in. OP recognizes this and wants to avoid that discussion from resurfacing each time her photos are shared. OP already knows that the family is very traditional, will notice the bushy pits, and will probably want to make comments about them. She simply wants to avoid the confusion, while respecting her sisters right to do what she wants with her bodily hair. She's seeking some type of respectful compromise, which is so much better than simply demanding that her sister shave the pits.", "I trim my armpits to finger length. Even just a trim with the electric razor would keep the pit hair off camera and not nessitate complete shaving", "Same! Best decision ever for me! Big reduction in BO and it stopped all the infected armpit hair follicles I kept getting. Not much hair either, not enough to show up on wedding photos even with a sleeveless dress.\n\nOP please ask her to consider trimming it up, but asking her to shave it might be a bit too much. People don't shave their pits for all sorts of reasons and unless you know hers you could be treading on dangerous ground.", "She bought a dress that exposes it", "I don't shave (well, every 4 months, I'll take clippers to everything) and sweat a lot, and using African Black Soap (NOT the stuff you find at stores that has a million ingredients that can trigger odors, but the 3 ingredient one) has changed my life. That, and some coconut oil to cut bacteria on sweatier days are game changers.", "That's what I'm saying: choosing a dress vs asking her sister to alter her body hair has the same intent so it's not a better solution. If op chose a dress for her sister she could just as well be making the same post \"wibta if I chose a bridesmaid dress for my sister to hide her hairy armpits\" it's the same thing as her current situation. The non asshole thing to do is just to let her sister do what she wants with her body hair", "Except choosing your own bridesmaid dresses is perfectly reasonable and standard. Asking your bridesmaids to change their bodies is not. This could have been avoided if OP decided to do the former in the first place. Since she didn\u2019t, she has no right to now ask the latter.", "Not really - if the bridal party has a wide range of body shapes, then choosing a dress for everyone could be seen as unreasonable. Just because it's a common practice doesn't change the fact that OP is only engaging in the tradition just to hide her sister's armpits. If the intent is the same for either action, then it's still an asshole-y thing to do. OP asking her sister (or all of the bridesmaids) to wear a certain dress just so that OP can avoid her weird aversion to body hair is still unkind."]}
