If you're not willing to do that, you will be TA. For the record, I only say this would be a reasonable thing to gently bring up because this is something she could quickly rectify with a 5-minute trim. She wouldn't need to shave, only trim to whatever length is both comfortable and suitable. It's not like you're asking her to color her hair (head or otherwise). \n\nIf you do approach her about it, you should be clear that you will absolutely not change her place in the wedding regardless.\n\nAll of that said... I don't think I would make this request. If she's in your wedding party, you can accept her as-is without it putting a damper on your evening or photos. And if it really was somehow that much of a bother... I'd rather just pay for the editing.", "Buy her a jacket, wrap, or something to cover.

Be prepared for her to react poorly if you decide to ask.", "YWBTA-I don't think you should even ask. You knew about her body choices when you asked her to be in your wedding party.

For someone who never does it, shaving could cause her itching, redness, and discomfort that either throws off your photos anyway or makes it difficult for her to enjoy your wedding and focus on you as your bridesmaid. A simpler solution that doesn't attempt an infringement on her bodily autonomy would be to find a cute, formal bolero or shrug to wear over her dress. It doesn't even need to be solid/opaque.

I also don't think that anyone owes it to another person to be pretty or attractive. \n\nThat said.

That's pretty healthy and mature so kudos to you.", "I think YWBTA for asking her to shave. Even if she agreed to do it, she may end up with irritated skin or ingrown hairs.

Why can\u2019t she just look like your sister? \n\nIf you find her body hair truly so disgusting that you must cover it for your wedding, you should make her change the style of her dress to cover her pits. If she\u2019s already chosen and paid for her first dress that means you will need to pay for a second one, since you already told her she could pick what she wanted and you now want to override it. But it\u2019s not okay for you to ask her to shave because you find her body unattractive. \n\nI just don\u2019t get how people don\u2019t want their friends and family to actually be represented in their wedding photos. When you and your friends and family look at your wedding pictures in the future, don\u2019t you want them to say \u201cOh look, there\u2019s Susie\u201d and not \u201cWhoa, who\u2019s this photoshopped person who kind of looks like Susie?

Imo it\u2019s the same as asking a man to neaten up his unkept beard before the wedding - you shouldn\u2019t have to ask because they should just do it, but they shouldn\u2019t be offended if you do ask politely. I have a few friends who don\u2019t shave their arms or legs, but they do shave for formal events.\n\nA lot of people are just voting based on whether they personally are ok with body hair which is weird. \n\n**The reason sleeveless tops aren\u2019t formal wear for men is *because* they don\u2019t shave.

It's difficult to judge because I don't understand why you even want this. Throughout the whole post you keep saying \"I obviously don't want to dictate what she does with her body\" and \"this is of course not our choice\", the only reason I can find is that you don't find it attractive. I guess my question is what's more important to you, your sister being at your wedding or your sister being attractive? By all means ask your sister if she would mind shaving for this one occasion or wear something to cover the hair, but be prepared that she might not like that question and that you might not see her at your wedding. Your priorities are your own and if you'd rather your sister not be at your wedding than her being there looking the way she wants, that's your prerogative.

Make sure whenever you ask her you\u2019re being clear that you don\u2019t have anything against it, it\u2019s just for the pictures and you\u2019re willing to find a compromise, and she\u2019s not getting removed from the wedding party either way", "You are NOT the asshole.

It's like if somebody tried to tell me that they charge 800 bucks to remove the red eye from the flash of 40 photos. I'd find that ridiculous. \n\nMy main Adobe platforms are Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, and After Effects. I have been learning and working on Adobe platforms since 2007. Photoshop is incredibly sophisticated now. That price may have made sense a number of years ago, nowadays you don't even need something like Adobe to make convincing and well blended touch ups on a tiny bit of hair. If money is the issue for her she could quite literally do it herself if this meant so so much to her.\n\nThere are so many tools in Photoshop now that take care of little details and touch ups like that with a ridiculous amount of ease. It doesn't take any significant amount of time to select a hyper specific selection any more. You can convincingly select, replace and content-aware fill entire backgrounds with a click of a button.\n\nSimple cut outs and touch ups are quickly becoming a cheaper and cheaper line of work because of how efficient our devices can do this for us now. Years ago I would make quick cash on top of my larger jobs by working on platforms like Fiver to offer quick cut-outs of people in photos so it's just an image of the people with a transparent background. iPhone updated just a few days ago where now you literally just tap and hold and it does it for you immediately and it does it very accurately for general purpose use. Thus rendering that service nearly obsolete save for those who don't have access to these devices at all and those who need the highest of quality editing. Why would anybody who has an iphone with that capability pay me 5 dollars to do this service when they have the means right at their fingertips now?\n\nIt would make sense to charge at least hundreds for the overall editing of the overall batch obviously. It doesn't make sense to tack on hundreds of dollars as an \"armpit hair removal fee.\" If the armpit hair is literally the only thing she wants edited in her photos and she's not going to be seeking tons of little touch ups and lighting editing and such then she can do it herself or hire somebody through a platform like Fiver to edit a specific handful that she wants to show to others and save herself from being ripped off and her sister the indignity.", "Don\u2019t even need to trim. Just style it with some gel.", "No they don't. There's not even remotely the same view on men and women's armpit hair by society lmao. Clearly men are not under the same pressure to shave that part as women are and are WAY WAY less likely to be called disgusting for not shaving it. Why do you think there is so many women who shave their armpits compared to men ? \n\nWhich is why this is firmly in YTA category : the sister knows most people find it unattractive, you cannot live in this world and not be aware of this. She *chose* to not shave and will either be very embarrassed or angry if OP bring it up but she will never answer like \"oh I didn't know most people would have a problem with it ! Guess I will shave then to please everyone else but me and contribute even more to the cultural norm of shaming women for their natural body :)\"", "Attractive in the sense of being aesthetically pleasing, not sexually attractive...", "Yes it would be wrong", "Exactly.

If so, OP is nor a sexist neither an asshole", ">People can say really mean and dumb things in really nice ways sometimes. \n\nWait, are you saying that expressing that you don't find armpit hair 'attractive' on a person (bearing in mind that word is actually pretty broad) is mean and dumb? But saying you like it isn't 'nice' by comparison. So how can that be true?\n\n>Op would be YTA for even asking. Shaving is a personal choice that shouldn\u2019t have to be defended in this day and age.\n\nThere's only something to defend if you perceive as an attack. This is a trickyish context because of how symbolic underarm hair is for feminism, but ultimately...it's hair. It grows back. It's not a big deal.\n\nI have a beard. I grow my hair out for years at a time sometimes.

What's the difference between us, because I don't understand why I can be so ambivalent yet some people see it as a hill to die on.\n\nForcing that on someone, or looking down on them for having that body feature, would be different. Asking them to temporarily adjust something impermanent and reversible is completely reasonable. If they say no, that's fine too.\n\nBut imo if you care more about asserting your individuality than supporting your friend on their wedding day, you're kind of being a dick - but maybe there's something I don't understand and am missing.", "Most of the population", ">Who gives a shit?

Dieting is hard and rarely successful. Dying hair can fuck it up. I wouldn't ask someone to shave a big beard they'd spent a lot of time growing, but I'd ask them to shave stubble. To me, armpit hair falls in that category, especially if covering it is an option. It's also common to have bridesmaids do their hair a certain way, wear a style of dress  they may not normally wear, etc. It is, currently in western culture, always going to involve some compromises on individual style.", "Wait it's not an expectation here you are from that men trim their pit hair back?
