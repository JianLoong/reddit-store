She wasn't a terrible mother, but not a good one either. We don't have much contact.\n\nMy aunt (51), we'll call her Anna, is much closer to me than my mom. Anna has a really rough past, she found out she was pregnant after her partner died and decided to abort the baby. I see her as a mother figure and she's viewed me as her daughter, and we've always been there for one another.\n\nMe and Anna live in the same area, she's the only relative I have regular contact with. Anna is a college professor and she's been in a relationship with another professor for about a year. They met when he came here for a conference or something, but he lives in a different state. I didn't consider this that serious as Anna didn't care much for long term relationships, and she's not exactly young anymore. \n\nA few days ago, we met up for lunch and Anna dropped the little tidbit that she was planning to move to her boyfriend's state, and she's already received job offers. I was pretty shocked. Anna said she was waiting for everything to be confirmed, and she'll be moving in February.\n\nI told her she should've at least discussed things. Anna said this is what's best for her. I got upset and replied that she's throwing away her successful life here, and ditching me to run off like a teen.\n\nAnna was snarky and said she doesn't need to go over everything with me, and I called her selfish. Anna got mad, I called her later because I do realize I might've gone too far saying that, but she didn't pick up.\n\nI don't think I said anything that bad initially, considering she didn't even bother telling me before making a rash decision. My fiance agrees with that she should've said something, but Anna is still clearly mad, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1668693175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxqw38/aita_for_calling_my_aunt_selfish_because_shes/", "score": 397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you actually saying how dare your aunt try to find happiness and make her own adult decisions?", "YTA - your aunt is a grown adult; she doesn't need to ask for your permission to make major life decisions.\n\nFrankly, you're the one being selfish and acting \"like a teen.\"\n\nYou should be happy that she's found someone who makes her happy and that she's able to make this move work to pursue that relationship. Just because she moves doesn't mean she won't still be there for you. The assumption that she's making a \"rash decision\" because it's not something that lines up with what you want is pretty cruel.", "YTA. Her move isn't about you. Given everything that has happened in her life, she deserves to be happy and is making moves to achieve that happiness. You should be happy for her! You're the one being selfish by making her move all about you.", "YTA here. You\u2019re criticizing a grown woman for making a perfectly rational decision to relocate to where the person she loves is. The fact that your aunt lost a partner isn\u2019t a \u201crough past\u201d, it\u2019s a tragic event. The fact that your aunt is 51 does not exclude her from having love in her life. It appears to me you perceive your aunt in one way: as the sad loser who exists to replace your mother. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your birth family\u2019s situation was what it was; that doesn\u2019t oblige your aunt to live a solitary life in order to be your mother substitute.", "You don't get to call her selfish when she raised you, that was very ungrateful and nasty to say.\n\nAnd unlike you who have a whole life ahead, she doesn't, and if she found happiness she should go for it.\n\nYTA, what you did was incredibly obnoxious and uncalled for. At least apologize properly", "YTA. You're 25, not 15; why are you throwing a temper tantrum bc your aunt is making a decision about *her* life? She doesn't have to run anything by you. \n\nShe raised you, you view her as a mother figure, and now she's leaving you and you feel slighted and like you're being abandoned. All understandable feelings, but no reason to act like a child about it.", "YTA. What exactly makes you think your very much adult and completely independent aunt needs to discuss her life plans with you? \n\nShe was a mother figure for you growing up, supported you where your own mother couldn't, she remained close to you as an adult... and you pay her by openly admitting you expected her to be alone forever just so you could have her around whenever you needed, adding that you thought she was too old to ever have a serious partner anyway. How dare you. \n\nYou're twenty-five years old. Anna has more than fulfilled her self-imposed (and never obligated) duty with you. She has every right to make any decisions she wants for her life. And absolutely no one knows what's better for her than herself. \n\nShe doesn't need your opinion, let alone your permission, to move and follow new life opportunities. \n\nAlso, you and your fianc\u00e9 think she should've said something? Guess what, she did say something. That lunch meeting was her giving you a heads-up that she's moving away IN THREE MONTHS. \n\nHonestly, how dare you. You owe her a huge apology.", ">My (25)\n\n>My aunt (51)\n\nSo you are not at an age that necessarily requires care for.\n\n>she found out she was pregnant after her partner died and decided to abort the baby\n\nShe has nobody who relies on her and nobody but you to keep her where she lives right now, I guess?\n\n>she was planning to move to her boyfriend's state, and she's already received job offers.\n\nYou should be happy for her. That's a big step and one she most likely very carefully thought through.\n\n>I told her she should've at least discussed things.\n\nShe does not need your consent to move if that is what she really wants and makes her happy.\n\n> I got upset\n\nThat's a you problem.\n\n>she's throwing away her successful life here\n\n>she's already received job offers\n\nDoesn't sound like she throws away anything. Sounds like she moves to someone she loves and she seems to have things planned.\n\n>Anna said this is what's best for her.\n\nAnd you should listen to her.\n\n>ditching me to run off like a teen\n\nAgain, no. It seems like you just don't want to share her with anyone else.\n\n>she doesn't need to go over everything\n\nVery true.\n\n>I called her selfish.\n\nThen what are you? Why do you want to keep her where she is now so badly? Don't you want her to be happy, too? She's moving states, she's not moving out of your life.\n\n>she didn't even bother telling me before making a rash decision.\n\nAgain, it doesn't sound rash when she already has several job offers. She doesn't need to tell you. Hell, she could have told you on the day she moved and you wouldn't have the right to decide for her.\n\nConclusion: YTA. Stop trying to control the only relative you actually do have contact with. It'll only drive a wedge between you... if that didn't happen already because of your poor reaction.", "YTA. Why would a grown ass woman need to discuss her moving plans with you before she finalized them? Does she need your approval?", "She isn\u2019t the selfish one. YTA - a MASSIVE one. You\u2019re making her life about you.", "Wow... YTA - also incredibly selfish and entitled.", "YTA, \n\nShe isn't a child so she can make decisions over her own life. Your behaviour seems controlling over her tbh. Sometimes loving someone is letting someone go and it seems like she will be happier if she moves so let her go.", "YTA.  Seriously?  I\u2019m sorry, did you say you were 25 or 5?  Anna could be your *biological* mom, and it would still not be selfish of **her** to assume you as a(n allegedly) grown, independent adult can handle her having a life and priorities of her own without needing to run those by you for your approval.  If you want to *stay* part of her life going forward, apologize profusely and immediately for not saying what you *should* have said in response to her news: \u201cCongratulations; I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d", "Your aunt is a grown ass woman who has every right to decide what's best for herself, the only selfish (and quite entitled) person here is you, since you think it's perfectly acceptable to think you have a say in what she does with her life. Why shoudn't she join her partner?  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nSeriously? It's not like you're 12. You are a full adult. Your aunt is a full adult. Full adults make their own choices about jobs, where they live and significant others. It is not a committee decision. People in their lives, who love them, support them and go visit when they can and call often.", "YTA - she doesn't have to discuss anything with you, she's an adult and by the sounds of it she's a capable one at that. She's received job offers, she's happy in a relationship and she has every right to that.\n\nEdited to add: who cares what your SO thinks. It's not his life and his opinion means nothing.", "YTA - You can't call someone selfish for following their own happiness when you're entire goal in calling them selfish is to make them drop their own happiness to cater to your happiness.\n\nIf you love something, let it go.\n\nFurthermore, you're not entitled to having a decision in your aunts life  in any way, shape, or form. She would have been in her right not to tell you at all and disappear in the night.", "YTA.\n\nYou are an adult. I get that it's hard for you to lose your mother figure, but she can't put her life on hold just to stick around for you.\n\nYour reaction was totally selfish and unsupportive. \n\nYou have the right to be upset and sad, but trashing her decision was very, very immature. Clearly, it's what is best for her. That's all that matters.", "YTA\n\nShe is an adult and has a right to move, find happiness, and live her life. \n\nIn this day and age, there are numerous ways to still keep in contact.", "Uh huh. \n\n*She* is the selfish one. Yup.\n\nYeah no, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour aunt doesn\u2019t need to discuss decisions with you before making them.  If she wants to move, that\u2019s her call.  She doesn\u2019t have to stay in one place all her life just to make *you* happy.\n\n>I didn\u2019t consider this that serious as Anna didn\u2019t care much for long term relationships, and she\u2019s not exactly young anymore \n\nSo because *you* dismissed her relationship (because people in their 50s can\u2019t have serious relationships?), you missed your chance to talk with her about her plans for the future with this man.  That\u2019s on you.\n\nShe likes him, she wants to move to be closer to him, she has job offers already.  She\u2019s not \u201cthrowing away a successful life\u201d - you\u2019re bitter because you took her for granted for so long.", "YTA, I get you're close to your aunt because of your history.  This probably feels like another parent walking out, which is horrible no doubt and you have my sympathy.  But the comments about your aunt are rude,  especially that jab about her not being young.  How do you know this is a rash decision? More importantly,  this is her life and she should be able to live it.  I think you should apologize, and perhaps also seek therapy.", "YTA. How is rash decision after a year of dating? You clearly have some abandonment issues you should tackle in therapy, as you said your aunt have been there for you all your life and your are unable to give her support when she making a move for her happiness? YTA 100%", "YTA. Hello, your aunt wants to live HER life, not be constantly babying  you. You are 25, not exactly a kid anymore, and not HER kid to boot. She has the full right to be together with a man she wants.", "You're old enough to get married and have a fiance but it's not okay with you that your aunt wants to have her own life?\n\nYTA", "YTA.  She, an adult, informed you, an adult, about a decision, she, as an adult, made for her life.\n\nPerhaps that was not wise or perhaps she will be happy wirh a new start.  That is up to her though. It is a pity, that your closest relative leaves and it is ok to be sad. But it is not up to you to call her selfish, just because she takes a shot at happiness with a man.\n\nPerhaps sit down and think for a moment. Does your anger possibly come from disappointment, that she is no longer available to you? That would make you the selfish one.", "YTA. I think you were hurt and shocked that Anna is leaving. You\u2019ve been abandoned a lot, and Anna has been a source of safety, family and steadiness in your life. It is probably hard to suddenly remember that she is an adult, with her own needs and desires, and she\u2019s also in her 50s, which can be hard to find love if you have been alone. \nAnna gave up a large portion of her life to parent a kid that wasn\u2019t her biological kid. She sounds like a good person. I know it\u2019s probably hard to process she\u2019s leaving, but you need to apologize and be happy for her. You\u2019ll still have a relationship, you can still visit one another. You need to let her be happy and not let this harm your relationship.", "C'mon... You know YTA. She in fact DID tell you first as this is November and she's tentatively leaving in February. Even if she was your bio mom she still wouldn't have to consult with you or get your permission in this matter. Do better before she walks away for good. You were wrong and hopefully you will tell her so. \n\nAlso just FYI 51 year olds actually still have a life....they like to go to places like the Bahamas, and Italy, and Ireland, and they even ....have sex (gasp!)  Try to remember that she's lived twice the life you have and she may know herself better than you do. Also try saying thank you to her for staying around so long just to be there for you when she had absolutely no obligation to do so.", "Did you ask her for permission every step of the way in your relationship with your fiance? Were you willing to end the relationship at any eif she didn't approve? \n\nProbably not because you are an adult...so why do you expect her, an adult with more life experience than you to run everything by you when it comes to her relationship?\n\nYTA. You don't get to control how she lives her life and you don't get a vote on what she decides to do.", "YTA \n\nAnna stepped up to the plate when your mother couldn't/didn't.\n\nShe is a grown adult responsible and capable of making her own decisions.\n\nAnna is entitled to live her life without running it past you. Anna does not need to seek your approval or permission. She is not a teenager.\n\nThis is not a rash decision. She is letting you know now, because given your level of entitlement and selfishness of how she should live her life according to you, you'd probably have tried to talk her out of it before throwing your tantrum. Shes got job offers. A place to go and a relationship there. \n\nDid you seriously expect her to stay round forever while you lived your life, got married etc and do what exactly? YTA.", "YTA. Your aunt doesn\u2019t need to tell you what she does with her life. And shame on you for thinking she\u2019s apparently too old for a relationship. She\u2019s not ditching her successful life and \u201crunning off like a teen.\u201d She\u2019s changing jobs and moving cities to be closer to someone she\u2019s been seeing for a while now. People change jobs and move sometimes. Get over it\n\nETA: Don\u2019t you dare call your aunt again unless you\u2019re going to give her a genuine, heartfelt apology. If you can\u2019t accept how ungrateful you\u2019ve been and apologize properly, she\u2019s better off not hearing from you at all", "The only selfish person here is you. Sounds like you expect her to devote her life to you, and adult women, and forget about her own personal life. Grow up. She owns you nothing. You, on the other hand, own her a sincere apology and congratulation on moving on with her love life. YTA.", "Dude YTA you're a grown woman let another grown woman live her life and be happy for her she's found someone!!", "YTA. It\u2019s her life, her choice. Her life life choices don\u2019t involve you.", "YTA. I understand you were hurt but you really should support her. She supported you all those years, now you need to return the favor. Don't call her, go to her in person and apologize.", "YTA. You are adult, engaged, she's in love, job prospect, not throwing away a successful life, moving on.\n\nIt's time for her to enjoy life again, she suffered, she helped raised you, now she's just over 50, not that old, ready for change. \n\nThat different state, is it far away or \"next door\" ? She's not ditching you. You might want to consider therapy (abandonment issue ? Isolation ?). You can always visit each other, depending on distance. \n\nShe warned you 2-3 months in advance (February). That's not last minute, is it ? Not much discussion, but...\n\nConsider this, then go apology in person. Don't forget to calm yourself down first, breathe...", "YTA.  Damn,  She isn't young anymore? Seriously?  So because she's 51 she's not allowed to find love?  It's ok for YOU to tell HER what to do with her life?  She can't be happy because it will upset you?!? WTF?!?!   You're being selfish and controlling.   You said it yourself that she had a rough past, so now is her chance to be happy.  So stop being a selfish witch and show some love and support.", "YTA. Your life doesn't just stop when you get to a certain age. I understand you're sad about it but you're an adult now, she doesn't need your permission and she actually did give you a heads up..she hasn't accepted any job offers yet and doesn't plan to move until February.", "YTA - You\u2019re the one being selfish. You\u2019re an adult demanding that your aunt not move because it suits your preference for her to stay. News flash - she doesn\u2019t need your permission. You sound completely ungrateful for all that she has done for you and like don\u2019t particularly care if she\u2019s happy. Grow up and stop being so self-centered.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re the one being selfish. Why shouldn\u2019t your aunt be free to do what makes her happy? Do you run all your decisions by her first? Her moving isn\u2019t a joint decision and she doesn\u2019t need your approval. She\u2019s a grown woman. I understand she\u2019s an important person in your life but she can\u2019t stop living to please you.", "Soft YTA.  Your aunt is a grown woman and doesn't need your input to move to another state.  Her partner died, she raised you.  OP, I know you will miss your aunt, but you sound selfish and entitled.  That said, it has to be really hard for you.  Try to be happy for your aunt.\n\nETA:  I say \"soft\" because OP has already lost both her parents. 25 years old is an adult for sure, but this has to be really hard for her. I can't imagine what she is going through with the sole family member who was ever there for her moving away. Say it was me at 25 and one of my parents was moving away after a lifetime of stable connection. It wouldn't be nearly so traumatic for me as it must be for OP.  It isn't the same.  OP needs to talk to aunt about it and do what she can to repair the relationship.", "A soft YTA for me. You were abandoned by your parents and your aunt saying she's moving seems like it's brought some of those issues to the fore. But she is right: she's an adult (and so are you tbh) and doesn't need your permission to live the life she wants. Apologize to her and look into therapy if you can.", "YTA.   You were the one being selfish; not your aunt.  Apologize and admit you overreacted because you'll miss her so much.  She didn't do anything wrong.\n\nShe didn't need your permission to make arrangements to live the life she wants.", "YTA. Your aunt is doing NOTHING wrong. There\u2019s absolutely NOTHING selfish about her moving. You owe her a huge apology.", "Holy moly, YTA. \n\nYou are an adult. I get you may be upset and have feelings of abandonment, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to berate your aunt like that.", "YTA. She sacrificed her life to take care of you. I hope she NC you", "The assholery is strong in this one. YTA. Your aunt is a grown woman and does NOT have to run anything by you. She didn\u2019t even have to give you a three month warning that she was leaving.", "YTA.\n\nAnna told you now (in November) that she is planning to move in February. She doesn\u2019t need your permission to go live her life and be happy.", "I\u2019m just curious because you listed other people\u2019s ages but not your own. How old are you? It feels like you\u2019re maybe in your teens? I understand you feel hurt, maybe even a bit abandoned, but this woman has every right to move if she thinks it will make her happy, and she\u2019s right when she says she doesn\u2019t have to run her personal plans by you.\n\nEdit: I misunderstood the age listed on the post as the father\u2019s age, not OP\u2019s. Thanks for the corrections, gang!", "YTA. There\u2019s nothing to discuss. This decision is hers and hers alone.", "YTA.

You had a chance to say, \u201ccongratulations, if you ever need anything, I\u2019m here for you\u201d. Instead you blew it and treated her like she was a teenager.", "Why does a grow women has to check with you to live her life. The only selfish person here is you. Shame on you. Let her be happy!!\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re hurt that the only family member you are close to is leaving. It feels like she\u2019s leaving *you*, so you\u2019re lashing out. You don\u2019t want to be alone.\n\nBut instead of expressing that, of talking to your aunt and explaining you want her to be happy but will miss her terribly, you called the person who has always loved and cared for you selfish.\n\nShe has always been there for you. It\u2019s time for her to take care of herself.\n\nYou owe her a huge apology.", "YTA you are not a child, you are a full blown an adult, she has every right to make this decision on her own\n\nYou think people in their 50\u2019s are standing with 1 foot in their grave or something? She still has a lot of life to live\n\nYou need to seriously grow up, you are the selfish one here", "YTA. So you've had time to reflect on this and still came to the conclusion that you come first and she's the selfish one. Well ok then.", "YTA.. It's understandable that you're hurt the only relative you keep in contact with, lives close by, and are close with is moving away.\n\nYour aunt is living her own life and making decisions she feels is best for her and makes her happy.

You have a fiance and your own life to live yet she does not coddle you and cut you off from him. Be an adult and apologize.", "Op, go to bed. Sleep on it. Re-read your post. Go look in the mirror. You'll see an AH looking back at you.", "YTA. I understand she\u2019s like a mother figure to you and I don\u2019t know the relationship dynamic too much but if she\u2019s been there for your whole life, she sounds like a great person. The reason I think YTA is because clearly your Aunt is happy enough to make this life change for herself and decided to talk to you about it during lunch together. She told you, so that\u2019s not the issue. It sounds more like you wanted to be able to be a part of the decision, and honestly that\u2019s not a right you should have. It\u2019s her life, and she has a right to be happy and if she has cared for you for so long, why don\u2019t you want her to be happy and live the life she wants? It\u2019s honestly selfish to expect her to drop everything to stay there just because you\u2019d be upset about it. Her going to another state doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to see her or something, she could visit you still. So again, YTA because you\u2019re thinking selfishly.", "YTA - You are both adults. She has every right to live her own life without your permission or input. Its not like she disappeared in the middle of the night and just left a note telling you where was was. She is letting you know three months in advance. \n\nGiven your history it is reasonable that you have some abandonment issues, but that is something you need to work on with a therapist. Not something your aunt needs to put her life on hold to cater to.", "I did that once when my father was telling me he was selling his house. It wasn't anger it was broken heart I didn't want to give that close relationship up. I know you want her to be happy but she is such an important part of your life it was hard your 1st reaction. Try to work through it with her because each of you deserve happiness.", "YTA, but I empathize with you. I think you should talk to someone about possible abandonment issues, which of course you would have. Your aunt has no obligation to stay with you or factor in how you feel about what she does with her life. It sounds like she's done a lot for you. You're 25. People move away. It sucks, for a while, but that's life.\n\nI think your aunt will understand if you apologize. It's not like you can't visit her, and surely she still cares about you. You were a dick about it, but it's like blaming a toddler for making a mess: due to your experience and stage of development, of course you'd feel/act this way. and that's fine, but please talk to someone about this and apologize. Best of luck", "\u2026you\u2019re an adult, obviously have Internet access, and she\u2019s not even living the country (even if she were, would be fine as well) your aunt owes you nothing, however you should have the decency and maturity to be happy for her. She\u2019s not running away like a teenager (she\u2019s looking for jobs ffs) she\u2019s a woman in her 50s who has no reason not to relocate, even if it wouldn\u2019t involve her partner of a year. YTA but in a way that makes me feel sorry for you\u2026 talk to a therapist", "YTA\n\nSo she\u2019s been there for you and supported you moving forward with your life, your relationship and everything. Now that she\u2019s doing something for her own happiness she\u2019s selfish?\n\nShould she not be happy because she\u2019s old? Is it rash?", "YTA\n\nI missed your age at the beginning and was ready to give you a soft answer because I assumed you were twelve or something. Then I went back and saw your age.\n\nYou're an adult. There's no way to justify your belief that your aunt needs your approval or permission to get another job, have a romantic relationship, or move. It sounds like maybe she's indulged some of your fantasies of control previously, but -- good for her -- she also realizes you're not the center of her world.", "Sorry, but YTA here.

She wasn't a terrible mother, but not a good one either. We don't have much contact.\n\nMy aunt (51), we'll call her Anna, is much closer to me than my mom. Anna has a really rough past, she found out she was pregnant after her partner died and decided to abort the baby. I see her as a mother figure and she's viewed me as her daughter, and we've always been there for one another.\n\nMe and Anna live in the same area, she's the only relative I have regular contact with. Anna is a college professor and she's been in a relationship with another professor for about a year. They met when he came here for a conference or something, but he lives in a different state. I didn't consider this that serious as Anna didn't care much for long term relationships, and she's not exactly young anymore. \n\nA few days ago, we met up for lunch and Anna dropped the little tidbit that she was planning to move to her boyfriend's state, and she's already received job offers. I was pretty shocked. Anna said she was waiting for everything to be confirmed, and she'll be moving in February.\n\nI told her she should've at least discussed things. Anna said this is what's best for her. I got upset and replied that she's throwing away her successful life here, and ditching me to run off like a teen.\n\nAnna was snarky and said she doesn't need to go over everything with me, and I called her selfish. Anna got mad, I called her later because I do realize I might've gone too far saying that, but she didn't pick up.\n\nI don't think I said anything that bad initially, considering she didn't even bother telling me before making a rash decision. My fiance agrees with that she should've said something, but Anna is still clearly mad, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you don\u2019t feel those things you really are a big A H. \n\nYou seem to be lashing out because the one stable adult in your life is leaving - but you\u2019re not a child anymore. You\u2019re a grown adult and need to accept that your aunt owes you nothing and do some self reflecting.", "Since she\u2019s old at 51, I hope she has her walker with her to get on the plane <eye roll>, to love and happiness, because apparently that\u2019s only good enough for you \u2026 yta", "YTA. your aunt gets to live her life however she wants. she doesn't owe you anything. you also sound incredibly dismissive of your aunt's happiness.", "YTA. ms.girl. The woman raised you and youre now 25. \nIs she suposed to stop everything ro hold your hand forever?", ">I got upset and replied that she's throwing away her successful life here\n\nShe's not throwing away her successful life. She's using it as a springboard to a new one. She's even got job offers, plural, to choose between.   \n\n\n>she's not exactly young anymore.\n\n51 isn't that old, really. And even if it is, all the more reason to take the risk and have a go at being with someone who obviously makes her happy. And for new adventures and experiences! Is she supposed to not want \\*more\\* in her life?  \n\n\n>ditching me to run off like a teen\n\nHow is she ditching you? Is she throwing you out of the home you and her share? Is she going NC with you? OK, things will change with the loss of proximity but there are these things called phones. You can even, like, facetime and see each other. And the two of you can also visit. \n\nAnd... are you always going to stick around for her? Not get married? (your poor fiance!) Why is it OK for you to move on to a new stage in your life, but not for your Aunt?\n\nIn case you still haven't worked it out - YTA", "The move is a little about OP. Aunties waited 25 years to do something for herself!!!", "Yep OP has abandonment issues. Dad took off before she was born, mom also took off when taking care of a kid by herself got too hard. Now auntie is \"taking off\". She needs therapy.\n\nExcept she's not just taking off. She took up role of mom when OP's bio mom took off even though she was probably still hurting from losing her partner and having to make the decision to abort her own potential child. She raised OP to not just 18 but to see her as a stable adult who is about to embark a new chapter of her life and starting her own family.  She's not leaving OP all alone and helpless. Even if the aunt was biomom at this stage in their lives it would still be normal and acceptable for the aunt to go off and move states where she has job offers already and a relationship waiting for her.", "I saw that too. \n\nI guess at a certain age you just give up on love? Since the aunt is in her 50s, what would that be \u2014 40? Oops, 40 now. Can\u2019t date or find somebody to love. \n\nOP - you do realize that \u2014- wait for it \u2014- you could move too? If she means that much to you, you can \u2014- wait for it \u2014 find a job and a place to live near her. \n\nCrazy thought. \n\nOP - YTA", "No joke! I had to scroll back up to confirm OP was in their 20s!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I laugh at the idea that anything planned 3+ months ahead of time with someone you\u2019ve known and trusted for years could be considered a \u201crash decision.\u201d I\u2019ve moved across the county on much less notice with much less planning", "Old and cold and so very full of mold!", "With a rash"]}
