He's also an idiot for claiming stolen valor, because simply lying about being in military ain't it.", "NTA. \"Worked for the Navy\" is not the same as \"in the Navy.\" The services have a metric shitload of civilian employees and many of them describe themselves as  \"working for\" that service.

He entrapped himself in his eagerness to accuse you of stolen valor. You aren't even E-S-H. He assumed and made an ass of himself.

Setting aside the fact that he assumed something you in fact did not say and tried to make it your fault, he should have known not to press too hard if someone is being vague about what exactly they're doing for the military. Even if the work isn't classified, you're not usually supposed to describe it in detail for OPSEC reasons.", "NTA. I've never heard anyone who serves refer to it as \"working for\" a determined force. They commonly say they're \"in\" said force or that they \"are\" a (force) officer. So from the beginning is weird that he assumed you served when your wording implied you didn't. \n\nBeyond that, you didn't purposely try to mislead the guy; he just jumped to conclusions and embarrassed himself. \n\nThings that happen when people are tipsy or plain drunk.

I've been out more times than I can count. We ran into all sorts of people that lied about service.  When we went out, we would lie and say random stuff. \"I'm an inflight missile repair man.\" (Lol). \n\nAnyway, there were guys that lied outright and said they were in war. You ask them a couple questions about war and could tell they were lying. But we never talked shit or felt embarrassed. \n\nYou were drunk, maybe just a miscommunication or whatever. Don't feel bad about it buddy. And by the way, no one that's been in war actually cares. We're there for our brothers.
