If you\u2019re antisocial, and you prefer not to be approached to like this, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see you drunk in a bar chatting away with strangers.

It's not OP's responsibility to perpetuate or not perpetuate anything, but basic tact should tell anyone that if you're a stranger to this woman and her child, don't bring up her nightlife in front of the elementary schooler.\n\nAs I've said before, this sub isn't about being right or wrong. It's about whether or not a person is being an AH. OP put this woman in an awkward spot. Whether he was right, wrong, or neither doesn't matter.

They know that it's weird for their mom to be coming home drunk.", "But does that matter? Also, that she has some shame should be obvious because this OP himself said that getting wasted at a bar seemed to be \"her usual thing\". The core issue here really is that he shouldn't have referred to her nightlife in front of her 10-year-old son. Given that she seems to be a barfly, she probably would have been happy to talk to him about the bar if it wasn't for the presence of her *10-year-old son.*\n\nAnd think of it this way. Where was OP expecting the conversation to go (in front of her son)? If she hadn't booked it out of there OP would have probably talked even more about the bar, since they have absolutely nothing else in common. All in front of her son.\n\nYou get my point here. OP earns the YTA badge because of the fact that the very young son was present, and he brought up that his mom hangs out in bars.

No OP isnt the asshole either", "Pfft that's why I am suggesting next time try to feel out first if the person even wishes for a small talk (trust me not everyone enjoys it with strangers) and it is also good to see if they even recognize you as well.\n\nThen yo udon' t even risk blurting out something unwarranted.", "My bad.

I should have said half Irish and 80% (actually 82.something%) from the British Isles in general. \n\nI think I was thinking that Ireland was part of Britain, but subconsciously forgot it's not.

That parents should trust their maturity more often. \n\nBut I'm not the parents. It's not my call. In this situation, unless I somehow knew that the mother was okay with talking about her nightlife in front of her kid, I wouldn't bring it up.\n\nIt's sort of like cussing. Some of my friends with kids don't care when the occasional f-bomb is dropped in front of their kids. Other friends have practically ripped my head off when I slipped and cussed in front of their kids. \n\nIt's just part of the social contract. There are certain subjects and topics of discussion that you avoid in front of little kids. \n\nJesus. Honestly? I've typed up a lot on my opinions in this post.

So no, I think OP just did her one-sided unwarranted piece whilst maybe comitting a faux-pas in the process.  Well it is not an great issue, it was a small incident and Maggie probably won' t return after this, so no biggie. But OP came here to as kfor opinion, and whilst I don; t think she is necessarily an AH, I think if she has the need , she can start the chat in a better way next time.", "That's according to 23andMe anyway.

To be honest, I'm only barely in the YTA camp because my overall opinion is that it's common sense and part of the social contract that OP shouldn't have brought it up in front of the kid. As I said in another comment, I don't actually think that what OP did is that bad. It's on par with farting in a crowded elevator.\n\nTo answer your other comment, the issue of the mother being an AH is completely separate from this incident. Her alcoholism and lack of addressing it have nothing to do with what OP did. If I voted E-S-H, I would be saying that the mother did something wrong *in the store* when OP greeted her.\n\n(BTW, I'm putting dashes between in the initialisms of the judgements that I don't agree with because that bot that counts the votes doesn't pick up judgements that aren't initialized correctly, such as YTA and as opposed to Y-T-A. Also, an acronym is when you put together the letters you get from shortening whatever it is your shortening and pronounce it like a world or name, like DARPA. An initialism is when you can't use the letters to make a new word or name, like USA.

It\u2019s not something you need to shelter children from in the slightest", "Some people in this thread are weird. IMO maybe Maggie shouldn\u2019t motorboat strangers in bars if she doesn\u2019t want to be recognized for that. I personally see no reason why OP is TA - she never mentioned her behavior in front of said kid and a bar is a normal place for adults to visit. The kid also likely might have no idea what a bar even is.", "Do you live in the US?", "I think its beyond a fair assumption that someone's child can handle the fact they go to bars especially at 10. Would you really not bring it up without asking if it was okay?", "I actually agree. I think most 10-year-olds are well aware of the existence of bars. They might not be aware of the extent of the \"adult stuff\" that happens there, and this mom's kid probably doesn't know that she regularly gets hammered at bars (at least I hope not), but they are aware that these places exist and basically know that people go there to drink.\n\nThe problem is that when I say, \"most 10-year-olds\", that automatically implies that some 10-year-olds really have no idea what bars are or what they're for. And I'm willing to bet that we're talking about a fair number of kids here, given how common it is for kids to be overly sheltered.\n\nAnd no, I would never bother to go so far as to ask, \"May I discuss the subjects of bars and drinking in front of your wee child?\" I'm just saying that I wouldn't assume that it's okay to specifically bring up that I was hanging out with a drinking mom in front of her kid, especially when they're both basically strangers.\n\nAs I've said before, I don't think that OP did anything shockingly wrong here. Ironically, I would call this a party foul. I do think OP put the mom in an awkward situation (given that she said so), but not in a truly difficult situation.

I'm European, and this would be regarded as highly inappropriate. Smile and greet customers, and leave it there, unless the customer recognises you and wants to chat. Otherwise...just be discreet. She didn't even remember you!", "Yeah probably. But OP doesn\u2019t even know her outside of this. Or the ex? Are you a bot?", "Yes, discretion doesn't seem to be highly valued in the US, from what I'm reading. I'm European, and while polite pleasantries are fine, it would be inappropriate to bring up anything remotely personal, like this, to a customer you didn't actually know. Maybe NTA exactly, but a little tactless and tone-deaf just the same.", "Jesus ,nosy people like you are why Europeans think all Americans are this intrusive. A bar is a social setting. This was a professional one. Different entirely .", "There's a time and place though .", "Jesus, your perspective on reality is horrifically skewed.", "This isn't a social setting, it's a business situation! Aside from pleasantries any further conversation should be initiated by the customer, if at all. She didn't even recognise OP, and it was highly inappropriate to bring up their random meeting. This is why Americans have such a pushy reputation  abroad. NTA, but tactless and tone deaf. Read the room in future!", "In a social setting, sure. This was not, and any chitchat should be initiated by the customer, if they want it .", "Don't just spit out ad homs. That's the cowardly approach to debate. Explain yourself.", "Uh...okay.  Messy.  Messy?  In any case, you're now misrepresenting what happened, which is kind of a messy approach to the information we've been given.", "The bot doesn't look at nested comments at all, just the top voted top level comment. Plus what the other person said about manual review, but even if you want to save someone effort, you don't need to do it here", "I'm not beholden to explaining anything to somebody who displays a disconnect from reality and falsely accuses me of employing fallacies. What I said was short, 100% applicable, and not \"just some personal attack\". It was a genuine analysis of what you brought to the table.", "Really? So, if the top voted comment judges NTA, and even if all the votes beneath that total more YTA judgements, the post will be labeled \"Not the Asshole\"? That's ridiculous.", "Edit and disclaimer: I apologize to anybody who recognizes that this is basically an intellectual pissing match between Adventurous-Sir-8326 and me. One of my guilty pleasures is locking horns with anybody who *thinks* they have an understanding of informal logical fallacies but obviously does not. But in this case, he actually is trying to criticize my position on this post. He's completely failing, but he's trying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst you throw an ad hominem at me by telling me that I'm essentially crazy (don't play innocent, you're smart enough to know what an ad hom is, now own up to the fact that you clearly used one), and now you're refusing to justify your position by throwing another ad hom at me (I'm \"somebody\", blah blah blah, who's crazy). Therefore, you're superior and don't need to make an actual point for the likes of some moron like me.\n\nZero percent of what you said has any \"genuine analysis\" of the debate or my position in it. I mean seriously, you didn't say anything about anything I said other than that my \"perspective on reality is horrifically skewed.\" Seriously, how do you know what an ad hominem is and not recognize that what you said is a textbook ad hominem?\n\nWhat's going on? You mad bro?", "Well, if there's one amazing YTA comment with 400k upvotes and 99 NTAs with 1 vote each, it doesn't sound that ridiculous anymore. They had to choose some strategy and that's the one they chose.", "I thought it was clear that I'm familiar with ad hominems when I said \n\n>not \"just some personal attack\"\n\nAnyway, OP left a comment detailing how she had heard the woman rambling about all the different bars she goes to, what drinks she gets, and what her schedule is for doing so.\n\nSo, there's a huge problem with someone who has such a level of alcohol abuse raising a child, and another problem arises when she gets pissed at other people for the mere fact that they mentioned she was at a bar. There isn't any reason for this alcoholic to shield her child from the fact that she \"was in a bar that one time\" that would be beneficial to the child. \n\nThere's no good reason to think OP was going to take the conversation anywhere beyond \"Hey, I remember you.\" \"Oh yeah, I remember you too. That's neat.\" \"Anyway, your total comes out to-\"\n\nAlso, take a look at the edit in the original post. Not only is it shared that she motorboated OP's friend, which is something she *obviously* wouldnt have mentioned in front of the kid, OP explicitly states that she would only have let the conversation continue if the woman chose so herself.", "Okay, those are good points. Despite my blathering, I vastly prefer a debate over the facts, and you're pointing out some good ones. \n\nAs I mentioned in other comments I made, I only barely think that OP is the AH because the general social contract is that you don't talk about personal \"adult stuff\" in front of kids, especially when you're a stranger. In the grand scheme of things, OP's public party foul is not really important or impactful. \n\nAt the same time, I think the mom has an actual serious drinking problem, and her addressing that is far more important to the kid than OP's public comment to her.\n\nStill, all of that is separate from the central question: is OP the AH for saying what she said. IMO, technically, yes."]}
