Our entire group scored him low. Afterwards we were all subjected to really nasty abusive texts. I felt bad at the time, but years later with the benefit of hindsight I just think it was entirely in his gift to pull his weight and do the work.\n\nThat said, if I were you I'd ask for feedback from the peer reviews, as it seems odd that they all scored you low when you did all the work e.g. did they think you 'took over' the assignment. I'd ask purely so you can use it for personal growth in the future if that's the case. But if you did all the work, they don't deserve the credit for it.", "NTA!

The other members of your group did no work.\n\nThis is a textbook example of why group work in an academic setting is a terrible idea -- it's almost always a terrible idea, but particularly so for a weeding course in a pre-med curriculum. (I'm assuming you're talking about organic chemistry here.) You don't want to weed out entire groups, particularly where the bulk of the group isn't pulling its weight. You want to weed out the slackards.\n\nThere's a debate to be had about the justification for requiring an A in o-chem as a method of weeding out medical school applicants. But as things stand, that's what most pre-med programs do, for good or ill. Thus, no one has the slightest grounds to tell you that you \"should have accepted\" a B in the class.\n\nAs for those who argue that group work simulates \"real world\" workplace teams: ridiculous. You don't have hiring and firing authority. You don't have the ability to appeal to a more senior person for help. You don't have authority to give bonuses.

He did eventually get his degree but he had to go through a lot to get back to where he was (psychologically, physically, and monetarily). No one should have to go through that for a damn degree.", "I feel the best thing group work does is improve communication skills and teach people how to identify people that won\u2019t do work and get them out of their group before it is too late, a good skill to have in a professional setting.", "I wouldn't say \"shouldn't exist\", just because my major/career is essentially just a lot of group work.

This advice comes from personal (worked on many groups projects during my Masters) and professional (I'm a college level Academic Advisor) experience. Good luck in your studies!", "From someone who just puttered around in various non-at-all-competitive liberal arts majors, this is crazy to me but I saw it happen to friends. Still blows my mind years later.", "What an off-putting system. I would think the goal is to be good, not to be better than everyone else. Your work should be judged on its own merit, not based on comparison to anyone else's.", "I mean, even \"communist\" countries have a leader - and the whole point of communism is true equality where nobody is higher than anyone else.", "I get that sometimes that's all you can do.  I reached out to the professor after the first week when I couldn't get a student to respond.  Professors don't want students to fail.  Sometimes if a group is struggling they will reach out and interject into the group to help establish expectations if they want participation points.", "I'm also a person who likes to just get it done but you have to keep in mind every one's managing different things.  You can establish a large part of the project on your own then give filler parts of an assignment to each student so that everyone is contributing.  For instance you can find the research for your research articles and send it to someone and assign apa citations to one person.  You can assign one person to be an editor check for spelling and consistency exc.", "No.", "[deleted]", "I'm infectious disease, so yeah premed.", "The only thing is that sometimes that can bleed into setting unreasonable expectations for the rest of the department.", "Honestly calling themselves an overachiever is what put me off\n\nClearly NTA, and the group was wrong. But this gave me flashbacks of college students who legitimately think they are gods gift to the world", "I had this same issue. Was in the workplace for a decade before I returned to university, so I treated it like a job. There were certain classes where students \"had it out for me\". I remember a few students getting angry because I wouldn't agree to tank a final so the grades would be curved. Very bizarre behavior.", "I knew that'd be a problem from the beginning, especially because they kept assigning me \"leader\" roles. I was to write up the plan we discussed and get it to the people who couldn't be there, I was to make and turn in all documents, schedule our meetings, etc. So it feels like they meant that they don't like bring told what to do.", "That's not a bad idea. Thanks", "Speaking on the different circumstances point, what would you suggest about a groupmate who does nothing(literally doesn't even open the document or come to the presentation) but claims a fever of 104 and covid. I dont wanna rate her poorly in case it's true but also she did nothing so idk what to do.", "One girls entire job was completing the citations, assured us it was done. But the day of the deadline I reviewed it and our \"citations\" were just a bunch of links, she refused to respond and I had to do that too.", "Yeah, imagine that situation and everyone else in the group is a brick wall who doesn\u2019t respond to anything except actively trying to bring you down for no reason. That team is a detriment to both doctors and patients. You can be a devil\u2019s advocate, but remember you\u2019re still considering them the \u201cdevil\u201d", "If the doctor\u2019s team behaves like the group members, they would be fired and replaced with competent people who can contribute. It\u2019s absolutely not the doctors job to bring the team along, as in the real world there will be problems the doctor can\u2019t solve all by themselves", "I'm surprised the professor intervened. In my experience, if everything was already submitted, most would say \"too bad, you should have worked it out before.\"\nGlad you had one of the good professors for this course.", ">at the very least such group project structures should be saved for grad students, who have proven they're serious and capable of buckling down to do college level work. \n\nYou shouldn't be in college, as an undergrad, if you aren't capable of doing college-level work.", "As a professor, I have to admit, these students irritate the shit out of me.", "Teacher, and same. \n\nNTA, but the unnecessarily embellishments gave me a worse impression of OP than I\u2019d have had if they just gave the facts.\n\nAlso, wall of text. I know it\u2019s not fair as it\u2019s an app and not a written assignment, but it just irritates me."]}
