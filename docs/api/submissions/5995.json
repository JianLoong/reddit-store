I felt bad at the time, but years later with the benefit of hindsight I just think it was entirely in his gift to pull his weight and do the work.\n\nThat said, if I were you I'd ask for feedback from the peer reviews, as it seems odd that they all scored you low when you did all the work e.g. did they think you 'took over' the assignment. I'd ask purely so you can use it for personal growth in the future if that's the case. But if you did all the work, they don't deserve the credit for it.", "NTA!

The other members of your group did no work.\n\nThis is a textbook example of why group work in an academic setting is a terrible idea -- it's almost always a terrible idea, but particularly so for a weeding course in a pre-med curriculum. (I'm assuming you're talking about organic chemistry here.) You don't want to weed out entire groups, particularly where the bulk of the group isn't pulling its weight. You want to weed out the slackards.\n\nThere's a debate to be had about the justification for requiring an A in o-chem as a method of weeding out medical school applicants. But as things stand, that's what most pre-med programs do, for good or ill. Thus, no one has the slightest grounds to tell you that you \"should have accepted\" a B in the class.\n\nAs for those who argue that group work simulates \"real world\" workplace teams: ridiculous. You don't have hiring and firing authority. You don't have the ability to appeal to a more senior person for help. You don't have authority to give bonuses.

I was in an M.BA program where there were both day cohorts and evening cohorts.  Sometimes, evening students needed to take a day class and vice versa. The evening students would all be balancing full-time employment and many of us families too along with our schoolwork. As a result, we were highly organized and driven to get things done. From our first classes in the cohort, all were able to take measure of each other, as in who would do the work, and who would not. We learned to sit together with people that we could trust, and immediately group-up when it came time.\n\nThe goal as to help each other to pick up the slack for each other when needed, to count on each other. I took up lot of slack on the first few semesters, because most of the other people in my team had families as well as work that they were trying to juggle. My second to last semester, I had to deal with a bad situation, and the other team members stepped in to pick up my slack. It was amazing.\n\nThe apple cart was upset though in our last semester. Day students were placed  in the evening class, and you know where this is going. We had a group project that was a presentation,  and that project included a day student. Her assignment was to do the title page of the deck, the names of the participants, and any upfront references and summary. That was it. The rest of the 70 page deck was done entirely by the rest of us. As we tick towards the end of the semester, we start asking her over and over again for this one page. One excuse after another.

But she decided to show up, hair wet and with chlorine odor from a quick dip in the campus pool. We did our presentation with the deck and while she stood with us, she had no lines in our script presentation. We gave the professor our grades for each other. He only accepted the grades that we gave to her, and none that she gave to any of us,  because we had CCed him on her final notice from the week before and he knew what the score was.\n\nHer trip to Sweden was not for her graduation.

One person did their part, one person did the bare minium, and the 3rd one never attended any of the conference call meetings. They were in a different time zone, but they agreed via email to the times we selected. I am a worrier (although others might label me an over-achiever), so I picked up the slack and made sure everything was completed and turned in on time. It is a lot less stressful to do the extra work than worry about whether my teammates were going to tank the project and ruin my grade. \n\nLater on in the MS program, a different professor gave us a team assignment. But he gave us a week to form our own team if we wanted; the remaining classmates would get assigned randomly by the professor the following week. \n\nEven though we had never met in person, I recognized two names from other classes we had shared - they both participated in group discussions and seemed to be decent students, so I invited them to be part of a team together.  I liked those odds better than a random team.\n\nIt worked like a charm - we agreed to divide and conquer and everybody had their portions complete by our next check-in. I didn't have to stress out and our project was completed on time with no sacrifice in the quality of the work. We all agreed that if we were in any future classes that required forming teams we'd try and work together.\n\nThis happened with another class and a differnt professor. We ended up having to complete 4 mini-projects in the course of an 11-week quarter. I guess the 3 of us were the only self-starters in that class because the professor's feedback was that he would have liked to have given us a grade higher than A.

You really should not have enabled that behavior. They'll just screw another person over in the future.\n\nESH. Don't be complacent with asshole behavior. You ended up supporting it. Good job getting the truth sorted out!", "I gotta ask the WHY..\n\nWhy were these folks so vindictive towards you. WHOA..You must be really good and they are jealous. NTA..I love your professor.", "I am an adjunct professor and I can\u2019t tell you how many times this happens. I meet with all the groups at least once a semester to make sure they are on track and encourage them to talk to me if any of them are having problems keeping up with the group project. I\u2019ve only had one or two groups a year have problems with people, not keeping up their part, because I asked him to do intermediate draft as we progress. So some of this is on your professor, but I admire you for stepping up and doing the work that was needed. Oh yeah, NTA.", "You are NTA. You should always stand up for yourself. I would have likely done just as you, give the benefit of the doubt and treat them kindly. Also, I would have gone to the professor, if they had reviewed me like that. \nI guess they all found out, right?", ">I gotta ask the WHY..  \n>  \n>Why were these folks so vindictive towards you. WHOA..You must be really good and they are jealous. NTA..I love your professor.\n\n**I asked the same**", "THIS", "completely agree! a couple of my classes my grades would have been fine without peer group work crap. we had days we had to meet except in my case, and its my own issue nobody elses, I have a special needs child, no family or support except for my husband who hung out with out son on days I was in class. but the days they wanted to meet it was impossible. nobody could have concentrated with my kid around which would have then tanked everyone's grades. so I failed the class and was deemed lazy because of my situation.", "I think the \u201coverachiever\u201d and needing an A to keep their scholarship comments are relevant. This was me in college, and man- having a reputation for being smart & being on scholarship REALLY works against you when it comes to group projects! The other students know that you can\u2018t afford (literally) to not do all the work yourself if necessary because you need that A, and plenty of them are willing to take advantage.\n\nDefinitely NTA for being honest about it!", "Also in a real life work scenario and team lead may be able to remove you from the project or even fire you for not meeting expectations", "Amplify the pain and throw away the med basically. The worst is the ones who did jack, yet questions every decision you made.\n\nThe best ones Ive had... Had little to do with teamwork. People just took initiative and do their own thing, mainly because the assignment were fairly segmented with just a bit of communication needs to who's doing what.", "NTA but the rest of the group needs to be dropped from the program for their lack of integrity and inability to support the team. What if the deliverable was patient care for someone high risk. And to band together to screw you over after you picked up the slack. That takes some serious entitlement. They sound like a bunch of mean girls from a high school in a wealthy community.", "Can\u2019t stand group projects. Yes, I know it\u2019s a character flaw. I don\u2019t care.", "NTA - hopefully they learned about the FAFO system from this", "NTA", "I cant tell if this is meant as a sarcastic insult or a compliment. I dont know that they think im smart necessarily, just no fun bc I try to stay on track and remind about deadlines. Why they hate me to this extent I have no clue. They acted really friendly with me up until this point, even invited me to dinner. It wasn't until I asked them about my grade that they started saying nasty things.", "I truly meant it as a compliment and feel these classmates were intimidated by you. The professor rocks.", "Now that I'm actually in the working world I would love to work with someone like OP. Recording the minutes of a meeting copy and who is supposed to do what tasks, amazing. That is somebody who will get deliverables delivered and someone I want on my team."]}
