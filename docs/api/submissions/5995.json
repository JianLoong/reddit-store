You did not ask for their grades to be dropped and you asked your professor to consider the work you did. You had no control over the fact that they did not do their work, nor did you have any control over the fact that they tanked your peer review. It is unfortunate that they failed the class, but you were not in the wrong for asking your professor to look at the evidence that you had done the work.", "NTA I had a similar situation in university where one group member didn't do a thing. Our entire group scored him low. Afterwards we were all subjected to really nasty abusive texts. I felt bad at the time, but years later with the benefit of hindsight I just think it was entirely in his gift to pull his weight and do the work.\n\nThat said, if I were you I'd ask for feedback from the peer reviews, as it seems odd that they all scored you low when you did all the work e.g. did they think you 'took over' the assignment. I'd ask purely so you can use it for personal growth in the future if that's the case. But if you did all the work, they don't deserve the credit for it.", "NTA! Especially after what they did to you. Also where I went for UNI, even in nursing, if you made a C you were failing and a B was pretty low! You did what you had to do!", "NTA. More like just desserts.", "NTA, no idea how anyone could vote otherwise. You didn't ask for THEM to get tanked, you merely asked that YOU get the grade you deserved. Nothing wrong with that. If your groupmates' punishment was too harsh that's on the prof.", "NTA!!!! Group projects always play out the same way. \n\nI was always the \"editor\" for group projects (in addition to my own section), so I'd always be the one staying up the night before to piece everything together. \n\nOn one group project. One guy blatantly plagiarized his portion (data/calculations didn't match etc), I told him to fix it, he didn't, so I ended up having to do his part as well. Thankfully during the presentation he read from the notes I gave him. During the questions he tried speaking, I had to cut him off. I sent an email to the professor throwing him under the bus that afternoon. I never questioned whether I was an asshole. \n\nGroup projects are a great primer for the real world.", "NTA, so very NTA. Your groupmates, on the other hand... This story illustrates exactly why I never set my students assessed group work.", "NTA. Get it how you live", "NtA. They had time to get together to plan and execute your peer review but didn't have time to get together to actually work on the assignment. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA- if you were to have finished the assignment and submitted it before the deadline in that case you would be the AH. But if the deadline came and went and yet nothing was done you did what you had to do. They clearly were spiteful and all gave you a poor peer review on no basis but you just did what you had to do. Don't be guilty for having to look out for yourself.", "NTA\n\nSo let me get this straight.\n\nYou did all the work.\nGave them good reviews.\nThe fools, for some reason, gave you bad reviews.\nYou retaliated and showed factual information to save your scholarship.\n\nThose dumbos (the kindest words I can think of right now) screwed you over sooo many times, they deserved to all get kicked out.\n\nI usually give bad peer reviews when I have to do all the work and can be pretty \u201cunhappy\u201d over it, but the amount of patience you had with these fools is very astonishing.", "NTA", "NTA in the slightest. The other members of your group did no work.\n\nThis is a textbook example of why group work in an academic setting is a terrible idea -- it's almost always a terrible idea, but particularly so for a weeding course in a pre-med curriculum. (I'm assuming you're talking about organic chemistry here.) You don't want to weed out entire groups, particularly where the bulk of the group isn't pulling its weight. You want to weed out the slackards.\n\nThere's a debate to be had about the justification for requiring an A in o-chem as a method of weeding out medical school applicants. But as things stand, that's what most pre-med programs do, for good or ill. Thus, no one has the slightest grounds to tell you that you \"should have accepted\" a B in the class.\n\nAs for those who argue that group work simulates \"real world\" workplace teams: ridiculous. You don't have hiring and firing authority. You don't have the ability to appeal to a more senior person for help. You don't have authority to give bonuses. And most workplace projects reflect on the company; they're not scholarly work, and they're not weeding projects to determine who gets to be a doctor.", "NTA fuck em,", "NTA. they fucked around and found out :)", "YTA. A successful doctor should be able to reach a favorable outcome for themselves and their team.", "YTA, however, sometimes it\u2019s okay to be an asshole and in my opinion it was well warranted. Screw those people. I salute you.", "true but group projects still shouldn't exist. People like OP always get stuck with lazy do-nothings who coast on their work. What does that teach you, other than that life's unfair and full of assholes?  \n\n\n...I mean, well, on second thought that IS true. So maybe it is useful education. But it definitely shouldn't cause you to fail a degree!", "They probably assumed OP would give them low ratings since, you know, they didn't do anything and thought if ALL of them gave OP a low score then the prof would believe them over OP", "I thought so too. They said in their reviews that I didn't communicate properly but I think that was a cover up. I dont always come across as the most likeable and they were friends before the assignment came up. Personally I think they believed I would drop their grades and it was a kind of preemptive revenge but thats just my speculation because when I asked they ignored me.", "Story doesn\u2019t add up", "There\u2019s a reason every company has a CEO, every government has a prime minister.\n\nLeaders are important and learning how to lead is an important aswell", "Imo this isn't really a revenge story as much as it is self defense. He didn't try to screw them over, he tried to get the truth out.", "Rule 13", "They said that I failed to communicate with them, which is why I included the text logs to the professor. I think people resent me bc I try to momma bear too much, which I'm working on.", "In a major/career that is pretty much all group work, I absolutely was in courses where group projects were meant to simulate the real thing.\n\nBut seeing as my major is extremely uncommon in colleges and most careers don't require that sort of teamwork, I'm confused as to why other programs include group projects in the first place.", "?\n\nWhat is your logic here?\n\nThe only logical way you don\u2019t see the group as the AHs if you are that type of person to not do the work and feel attacked by this post", "I completely agree that group work specifically in a college setting isn\u2019t conducive to good work ethic. You never know if you\u2019re paired up with someone who is trying their best or just coasting. Trying to see if you can manage other people to do their jobs all while trying to juggle your own gpa is ridiculous and lazy on the schools part.", "My friend failed the one class he needed to graduate *three times* because of group projects and his teachers refused to help him, no matter what he said- even when he *begged* them. He had a mental breakdown the fourth time it happened, dropped out, left all his things, including his car and phone, behind. We all thought he either joined the military (he briefly toyed with the idea even though it was *very* not him) or dead. He finally got in contact with me and his sister a month later on the opposite side of the country. That was one of the most terrifying experiences of my entire life. He did eventually get his degree but he had to go through a lot to get back to where he was (psychologically, physically, and monetarily). No one should have to go through that for a damn degree.", "I feel the best thing group work does is improve communication skills and teach people how to identify people that won\u2019t do work and get them out of their group before it is too late, a good skill to have in a professional setting.", "I wouldn't say \"shouldn't exist\", just because my major/career is essentially just a lot of group work. Our lazy do-nothings were non-majors that didn't understand the importance of our major, only that the class was required as part of their majors.", "God I love to see it\n\nHoisted by their own petard", "They ignored you, so it sounds like they deserved the grades you got and you deserved yours. I know your professor won't be able to disclose their feedback, but ask if he/she can disclose any general themes or give you feedback to help work as a group in future.\n\nBy the way, I'm not saying this because you did anything wrong, the others in your group (apart from the one who did their bit) sound like they just expected you to either carry them through or fail along with them, so good on you for not doing either of those things. I'm saying it because I don't see why they scored you down when you did all the work, so you might get some good tips for working as a team in future, e.g. the momma bear thing you are already working on. Good luck, you sound like you work hard and deserve every success.", "at the very least such group project structures should be saved for grad students, who have proven they're serious and capable of buckling down to do college level work. Undergrad courses are full of washout party boys who have no interest in working. Undergrad should be about identifying and lifting out the students with work ethic, not letting them be dragged down by their inferiors.", "I understand why you said that, the first thing I did was ask for their feedback. And actually my professor did give it to me, quoted and everything. That's part of how I knew they worked together for the feedback, everyone's speech was nearly identical."]}
