She's a single mom, so the family tries to help her when possible. My husband and I agree that both Seth and Anna are very self-centered. When we can, we try to help Seth learn to see other's perspectives and break out of his self-centered-ness, while acknowledging that he is 10 and this can be a challenge for a child. We had him an extra day yesterday because we were both off work and he was out of school.\n\nWe limit the beverages Seth has at our apartment. If he wants something to drink that's not a cup of water, one of us has to get it for him. This is because we've caught him guzzling multiple sodas in a matter of minutes after telling him he can have *one*, or he'll drink our chocolate milk from the carton, etc. He can't control himself with sugary beverages.\n\nWe had just finished eating lunch and Seth asked if he could have a cup of milk. My husband said he would get him one in a few minutes. Unfortunately, my husband ended up blacking out and had a short convulsive episode This happens occasionally, so I tried to keep myself together to get him on his side, time it, etc. I was also trying to tell Seth to leave the room until it was over because it's distressing to see, but Seth stayed in the room. Thankfully, my husband woke up right after the episode subsided. He was alert but said he wanted to lie on the floor for a while. As I was getting him a pillow, Seth asked my husband, \"Well, can you get my milk first?\"\n\nMy husband didn't respond to him, but I did. I pulled him into the kitchen (where I could still keep an eye on hubby) and told him he was being \"unthinking and selfish.\" I will admit my voice was raised, in part due to the stress of the moment leaving my body but also, admittedly, out of anger at Seth. I permitted him to get his own milk for the moment because I thought I would lose my cool if he asked again.\n\nAnna apparently heard of this after Seth went back home. She has been going back and forth with me and my husband through text (and one very angry voicemail) saying how dare I scream at her son (which I did not do) and how it was our fault for having \"stupid rules\" for him. My in-laws are trying to play referee but they want me to apologize to Anna because \"it would make things easier for everyone if she wasn't angry.\" I said it would be easier for everyone if Seth (and Anna) were taught to be a little less selfish. She hasn't shown any interest in how her brother is doing.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699487473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qzhj8/aita_for_raising_my_voice_and_saying_my_husbands/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anna does not deserve.  NTA, I would absolutely have yelled at my kids here as the adrenaline left my body in this situation and they asked something so SELFISH.", "Would it make things easier on Anna if you stopped watching Seth for a while? I think  Yes.\n\nUntil she can learn to have a calm conversation with the adult that was present during the situation, shes on the naughty step.\n\nAnd maybe suggest therapy or parenting classes. She's not teaching her kid empathy, his ten years are going to be a horror\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour post implies you\u2019ve been trying to teach him some kind of awareness, so this isn\u2019t the first time.\n\nHe\u2019s a kid, so I wouldn\u2019t be TOO incredibly hard on him in general, but after your husband JUST having a seizure? Completely understandable to speak at an elevated volume.", "NTA- you were in a high stress situation and this shows an incredible and potentially dangerous lack of awareness on Seth's part, beyond the clear and obvious selfishness.\n\nWhile he is a child, he is old enough to understand that other people exist, have needs and feelings, and even be criminally charged in some jurisdictions. Barring some undisclosed mental challenge, at least. He may not have a fully developed sense of empathy or boundaries yet, but he should at least be aware that a medical event takes precedence over his immediate desire for milk. That kind of question is something that might be reasonable for a 5 year old, but not a 10 year old.\n\nAs for your in laws...yes, I'm sure it would be easier for them if Anna wasn't angry. It would also be easaier for them if they had instilled a sense of contrition and understanding of other people or at least social norms in their daughter. If Anna is going to be upset at you, let her be. If the in laws press and you want to be reasonable, remind them that you were doing a favor for Anna and that while you love Seth he will be expected to act like a reasonable human being of comperable age and mental ability in your home. If  you're willing to potentially make them flip out, ask them why them failing their daughter means your husband has to suffer and if they truly want Seth to grow up and enter the real world only to find that people think he's entitled, selfish, and unpleasant.", "NTA do not apologize. The reason she is the way she is is because people have catered to her atrocious behavior. Enough of that.", "NTA. Seth sounds like a spoiled brat, honestly, the result of permissive indulgent parenting. It's normal for kids raised under this parenting style to lack empathy. I was once with a child like this on an outing and someone with us starting profusely bleeding and she showed absolutely no empathy for him and wanted to keep playing. I would refuse to watch Seth anymore. Let his mother figure out her own child care...and figure it out when her precious angel starts getting in trouble at school. Since you know, there will be rules and stern teachers there.", "Nta. She needs to respect your rules, and confirm to Seth that he needs to respect them as well\u2026if they want to continue receiving free childcare at your house. The kid is 10 years old he\u2019s old enough to understand\u2026my kid is 6 and he gets it. There is nothing wrong apologizing to Seth for raising your voice though. Hope you guys can all sit down and figure out a healthy way forward.", "NTA and stop watching mahi-mahi for awhile. At 10 he is old enough to recognize a medical emergency. He should also be able to follow instructions regarding following rules regarding drinks. My 4 and 5 year old grandsons ask permission for drinks and snacks, accept when I limit or say no and can be trusted.", "Easy answer.  Stop watching Seth. Problem solved.  NTA", "NTA. A ten year old is expected to have some semblance of social awareness. And yelling at a kid for showing a complete lack of their surroundings during a minor emergency in the heat of the moment is perfectly natural.\n\nAlso, a ten year old can definitely get their own beverages. I have a 7 year old that gets his own drinks from the fridge, albeit with minor supervision. But that's unrelated to the post as a whole.", "NTA.  Bad parents make bad kids.", "Time to stop watching Seth.", "NTA. And maybe it is time for Anna to have new child care arrangements.", "NTA. Let Anna deal with Seth. It\u2019s not your job to teach a self centered kid manner or empathy. No more weekends until he can learn control and manners.", "NTA but I wouldn't watch him anymore if I were you, I understand where you are coming from wanting to show him other perspectives but at this age it all comes down to you aren't his parents so he's not going to change for you and your home especially if it's not tangibly benefiting him.\n\nKids learn from the adults closest to them which would be his mother who not only allows but condones his behavior by defending it.\n\nFor a parent reteaching a 10 year old empathy and sympathy would be a feat but for an outside caretaker to try to do that against parent wishes is impossible especially since kids need constant united reinforcement at home to correct this, even having one in home parent on board and the other spoiling the kid during bad behavior will not get great results.", "Stop babysitting it\u2019s not appreciated", "Tell me, OP, is your SIL angry enough to turn down your free babysitting services?", "NTA\n\nThe in-laws are enablers. Stop watching Seth. Anna or the in-laws can cough up money for a babysitter or an after school program.", "NTA.  Do not apologise.  He will not learn a valuable lesson if you give in. \nDon\u2019t stop minding  him, you\u2019re the sensible one in the family- he needs you \n\nYour in-laws need to back you on this one.

Even if you DID raise your voice, the fact remains that he\u2019s an ahole with an enabling mother. Don\u2019t apologize to make her feel better.

Your rules are reasonable.\n\nIt would make things easier if Anna parented her kid and people didn't act like the world revolves around her.", "To be fair to Seth, it's not usual for children to be familiar with seizures (what I assume you mean by \"convulsions\") and what to do when someone has one. But since, from what you describe, this is something your husband deals with in his life, it probably would be good to teach Seth some basic skills at his level around this. With my kids I've found it's really helpful to explain it to them explicitly, without judgement. As soon as you judge or criticize the child, their defenses go up, and they can't hear what you're trying to tell them. So the less threatening you can seem, the better. You want to give him, if possible, a simple and explicit, and short, set of instructions, for whatever you want him to do, at a level appropriate for his age. How will he know that your husband is having a seizure and not just goofing around? What will happen if your husband has a seizure when Seth is in the room but you are not? Does Seth know how to call an adult if your husband has a seizure? And so on. If what you want him to know is that your husband will be very tired for the day after having a seizure, you should tell him that directly. \"Seth, I'll get your milk in a few minutes but Bob has just had a seizure. After someone has a seizure they will be very tired for a few hours, so Bob needs to rest right now. What you can do to help is you can get him a pillow from his bedroom and put it under his head like this.\" \n\nI think Anna is very rude and your in-laws are being quite presumptuous to ask you to apologize to Anna when you are the ones doing Anna a favor, and Anna's lack of gratitude is probably at least part of why Seth was rude (he's picking up on her attitude I bet). Anna was also pretty callous about your husband's seizure, since all she cared about was that she didn't like Seth being snapped at during your husband's medical emergency. So her behavior is not very nice either.", "No judgment. Even if Seth is objectively self-centered in other cases, I don't think it's possible for a 10-year old to truly understand what had just happened to your husband. Blacking out, waking right back up. I just don't think he understood", "NTA. But it would also help Seth to have you apologize for raising your voice and explain to him how you were feeling at the time. Anna is an adult, so she should know better, but as you say, Seth is still a kid and still learning. Help make this situation into a positive learning experience for him.", "*My husband (26M) and I watch his nephew Seth (10) one weekend a month while my husband's sister Anna (30F) works extra or takes a weekend to herself. She's a single mom, so the family tries to help her when possible*\n\nSeth isn't being parented, just fobbed off on whoever will agree to take him for the weekend. Of course he is going to lack a whooooole lot of manners, ability to have empathy, a lack of understanding of how to behave that isn't self-centered. This kid is trying to scrape up whatever he can that might account for a normal upbringing and is basically bringing up himself. Rather than blame him for the sins of his mother, have empathy for him and become a solid place for him. \n\nUnless and until you decide to do that, YTA to think some 10 yr old kid should 'know better'.", "I mean this really depends.  Because he's 10 there's a good chance he didn't know your husband was having a medical emergency and didn't knwo the serious of it.  So calling him selfish with 0 context doesnt help him change his behavior.", "i dont think the 10 year old really understood what happend. i mean you are not wrong but i dont think a 10 year old understands the aftermath of a seizure. NAH", "YTA \n\nYou were expecting a 10 year old child to react to an intensely stressful situation with more composure than yourself. \n\nTake a look at your own emotions throughout the situation. You were the one who lost control of their emotions. Your nephew did ask for milk at an inappropriate time but it was your emotional state that caused you to react in an inappropriately angry manner.", "YTA he\u2019s 10. Adjust your expectations.", "I don't think you're an asshole. But if you're gonna watch a 10yr old, maybe read up on how to help them learn how to do shit for themselves. They'll like it, you'll like it. It's a wonderful win for everyone. Also tough love shit only works if there's actually love there.", "INFO: did Seth know that what was going on with your husband was a medical emergency?  \n\n\nNext... Get Seth a little mini fridge that only has HIS drinks in it that he's allowed to drink while at your home. Stock it with some shelf stable milk a soda or two or whatever you are okay with him drinking. That way he can help himself and doesn't expect to be waited on hand and foot which is contributing to his self-centered point of view.", "Honestly a little bit YTA\n\nFirst he is 10 and does not have a full grasp of what your husband's medical condition is or how serious it is regardless of you telling him when he was 8. You also really have no business trying to teach him any lessons or see any perspective. Kids that age learn from mimicking. I get that you think you are doing his mother a favor, but if you are going to not just try to make sure he is safe and love him as he is, then just stop watching him.", "The hilarity of calling a 10-year-old \"self-centered\" as if that's ... unusual.\n\nJust stop watching Seth. \n\nMild YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
