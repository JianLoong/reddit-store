My boyfriend asked what time the event that my program was hosting to reveal the match day results and I just knew he would be over the top with emotion and cause me embarrassment so I lied and told him a time well after I\u2019d find out. Match day was Friday and I got my first choice. My boyfriend arrived an hour before the event ended and was visibly upset with me. He went home after and won\u2019t return my calls. AITA?\n\n EDIT: Thank you everyone who has commented and gave me advice. I\u2019d like to preface by saying I love my boyfriend and know what I did was shitty and could have been avoided by a conversation. That being said he did text saying he wants to talk.

I\u2019m all for happy tears and tears of support but you shouldn\u2019t have to stop celebrating to calm him down or reassure others that he is fine. You also shouldn\u2019t have to leave your event so he isn\u2019t disrupting others. \n\nBut also you need to have a conversation about what\u2019s going on. He should be able to manage himself emotionally and you should be able to have that conversation. Crying is fine but the length, loudness, and attention it takes away is excessive.

If his emotions are embarrassing to you, why are you even with him?", "YTA. You lied to someone who needs to be able to implicitly trust you. Intimate, romantic relationships involve so much trust, and trust is delicate. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest, if you are embarrassed by him being himself and having feelings, especially to the point of lying to avoid him attending important functions\u2026 why are you guys together? \n\nAnd how is it any different when you aren\u2019t in public?

Why do you even stay with him?", "Lying about ANYTHING is just plain wrong. How can anyone trust you? YES, YOU ARE THE ASS. I wouldn't blame him for dumping you after this stunt.

I wouldnt want my special occasions to be sidelined by his uncontrollable emotions. Causing a scene at a baby shower and having to be removed to be calmed down sounds like way too much.

That's honestly just sad. \n\nCongrats on matching with your #1, but holy cow do you ever need to make it up to him.

I get where you're coming from because I used to be a lot like this, but if you keep people out of big moments in your life to avoid discomfort, it will push them away.

Maybe not common, but definitely normal. \n\nYou're so annoyed with him **being himself** that you actively excluded him, in a way that had to have been humiliating for him.

Which could just as easily be an inappropriate response. \n\nAnd let's be honest, if OP was talking about a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend, no one would assume he's being truthful about how inappropriate the emotional reaction was.\n\nPoint 9 here sums it up well: https://www.bellybelly.com.au/pregnancy/9-things-that-will-definitely-happen-at-your-baby-shower/\n\nOther big events are known to commonly elicit happy tears: https://www.insideweddings.com/news/planning-design/what-moments-make-guests-cry-at-weddings/41267/\n\nWhile crying unprompted can be a sign of poor emotional regulation, crying during milestone events is **not** in that category. Crying during milestone events is a way of sharing joy. It's not rare. And it's not inappropriate.  https://www.healthline.com/health/happy-crying#easy-communication\n\nOP specifically only references major events where crying is a normal reaction, and mistreating his BF over having that normal reaction. I don't see any reason to believe that OP's stated bias isn't an issue, when his other comments support the idea that he's the one who's overreacting.", "Soft YTA.  This type of behavior only perpetuates the stigma against men showing emotion.   \n He trusts you enough to be sensitive around you, which is a positive thing.  You should return the respect by including him in major life events, which includes Match Day.  My brother had Match Day this past Friday as well, and his wife stood by him the entire time we were waiting for the email to arrive (and 'we' included my parents, me, and my partner.)", "YTA. You should have just told him you didn\u2019t want him there when you found out. Instead you lied which is never a good idea", "NTA!", "YTA only for lying. I am also easily embarrassed so I don't think I can handle an overly emotional man.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. I feel there are certain accomplishments that others might not understand or over insert themselves in. Match day is a big deal (congrats on getting your first pick). Sometimes people just want to celebrate alone before sharing it with their inner circle. Especially if OPs bf is overly emotional, her having to tend to him might take away from the excitement and relief of match day results. Have a conversation why you wanted to absorb the info alone and go from there.", "I haven\u2019t checked, but I\u2019m wondering if the updates are about her boyfriend breaking up with her? \ud83e\udd14", "I don't think you need to jump straight to breaking up, because two people have some emotional growing up to do. I would say, without knowing further information, this is within the realm of the fixable.", "There's a difference between being \"openly vulnerable\" and loudly weeping to the point where you make everyone around you uncomfortable. OP wants to be able to enjoy match day without it being about his boyfriend and his boyfriend's over-the-top reactions. \n\nAgreed that he's wrong for lying and should've just told his boyfriend he didn't want him at the event rather than lying, though.", "She shouldn\u2019t have lied but it is hard to tell from her post whether she is embarrassed about him having emotions or being his \u201cauthentic self\u201d or if he is emotional in the way that makes major events in her life about him. Because one of those is a problem. I had a breast cancer scare and my ex was so emotional about it I had no room to feel my own feelings about it. I ended up comforting them and ignoring my own stress about what has happening to my own body.", "Yeah apparently OP had to escort his boyfriend out of a baby shower because his bf started openly weeping when the mother-to-be started opening her gifts. It sounds like he just wants all the attention to be on him....", "why is this so downvoted? That's excessive! Sure, people might shed a tear or two but to openly weep to the point where you have to be escorted outside? Super dramatic.", "Yeah, that's about how I read the post too. He's not being his authentic self excepting that his authentic self is at least a little bit of a narcissist.", "If they can't get a handle on their emotions, then they will be excluded for some events. It's BS when they become the focus when it is suppose to be about YOU!", "Yup. My mother has over the top displays of emotion,to the point where I have had to check my own stress about something happening yo me (traumatic birth) to make sure she was OK. It's exhausting and inconsiderate. I would have lied too. Actually I did this week. Selling my house at auction today, told my mom it is on  Friday so I dont need to deal with her if it gets passed in.", "Did you watch it in Spanish as well? If so how did they translate the cartel leader scene? My family quotes \"estoy hablando Espa\u00f1ol!\" scene all the time but I imagine it wouldn't be nearly as funny if the whole movie up till that point was also in Spanish lol", "yeah I can see shedding a tear or two at a baby shower if you're super happy for your friend, but openly weeping? Nah, it sounds like he wants to stay at the center of attention....", "Check out my account posted updates", "I said the same thing. \nI don't condone her lying, but I understand why she did it. I can understand something without agreeing with it.", "Well your comment certainly made it seem like all the fault of this incident was on him.", "Crying to the point she took him out to comfort him is not a good emotional regulation. Op saying she isn\u2019t comfortable with BIG display of emotions doesn\u2019t mean you can simply make up scenarios as you please like her talking upon herself to \u201cmute\u201d him. \n\nAnd him and his family categorizing themselves as crying connoisseur is nit a red flag ?"]}
