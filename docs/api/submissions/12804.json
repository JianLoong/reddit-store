Match day is YOUR accomplishment, and you don\u2019t have to share the initial moment it happens, even with your significant other. You knew he would likely become overly emotional and ruin it for you so you decided to tell him it was later in the day so that wouldn\u2019t happen.

Maybe he will understand and try to tone it down. But lying about this is gonna hurt like hell for him.", "YTA. I get where you were coming from- sometimes you want to find out important news privately. But lying was unnecessary, he was probably so excited for you and you crushed that.\n\nCongrats on your match.", "YTA for lying to your partner.\n\nI have a partner who can be pretty weird and not themselves in certain professional group settings to the point where I can feel embarrassed. Most of the time I can accept this because who cares. However there are times I am bothered a lot by it-- usually because I am very stressed or insecure around said people we are going to be around (colleagues, judgemental peers, people i don't know well, etc.).\n\nWe talked about it together, and it was really helpful for me to acknowledge my own anxiety and fear of judgement from others that is creating the embarrassment. This stems from childhood bullying. However, my partner also acknowledges she can be pretty weird when she gets anxious. Then it's not a fun time for either of us. Me explaining my feelings went over pretty well. Now we communicate more if it's a good idea for her to attend certain things that I'm feeling super worried about. Half the time she is neutral about attending these things, and doesn't care that much.\n\nI would never deny her something if she was super into it out of fear of embarrassment. The stuff above is all like optional social/professional situations. I would definitely want them there to support and celebrate with me during big events like match day. She is my rock.  I wouldn't care what other people were doing.\n\nIf you can't have a partner to cry with you or celebrate with you what is the point?", "YTA. Why have you been with someone for four years if you can\u2019t communicate with them honestly or have difficult conversations with them? Are you going to spend a lifetime being ashamed of them?", "As someone who also recently matched (congrats btw). I\u2019ll give you a very soft YTA. Most people can\u2019t fathom how much work and time it took to get to that momentous day and I totally understand not wanting to have to deal with your boyfriend during it. That being said, this is a huge thing that also affects him and he deserved at least a conversation around it prior to being left out.", "Yes, YTA for actually lying.\n\nYour post's title is misleading.  You DID lie to him, and that makes you the AH.", "YTA\n\nWhat other important life events will you want to exclude him from?", "YTA. You\u2019re embarrassed by the sincerity and care of the person you claim to love. You clearly care more about what some people might possibly (probably not) think than about sharing an incredibly emotional moment with your closest person. That\u2019s tragic. I hope  you find healing, OP. And I hope part of that is a sincere apology to your boyfriend.", "YTA, so what if your boyfriend has big emotions?\n\nhe feels he freely to be himself/safe around you, and instead you feel embarrassed? he was proud of you and wanted to celebrate you, so you lied to save your own feelings, of COURSE he would be upset, cause you lied\n\ngive him time to decide what he wants to do, and he\u2019ll return your calls when he wants to, you lied so you get the consequences of having to wait and let him be ready to talk to you", "Can I do a half and half? Like YTA for lying but NTA if he takes away from the event. This is a big moment and you (and other participants) deserve to be have a second to be proud of yourself and going the direction you planned for yourself. You worked really hard to get here. I\u2019m all for happy tears and tears of support but you shouldn\u2019t have to stop celebrating to calm him down or reassure others that he is fine. You also shouldn\u2019t have to leave your event so he isn\u2019t disrupting others. \n\nBut also you need to have a conversation about what\u2019s going on. He should be able to manage himself emotionally and you should be able to have that conversation. Crying is fine but the length, loudness, and attention it takes away is excessive. If you love him, you should be able to talk about this. It wasn\u2019t nice what you did but hopefully you can figure it out.", "YTA. Lying accomplishes nothing.", "YTA. I feel so bad for him. If his emotions are embarrassing to you, why are you even with him?", "YTA. You lied to someone who needs to be able to implicitly trust you. Intimate, romantic relationships involve so much trust, and trust is delicate. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest, if you are embarrassed by him being himself and having feelings, especially to the point of lying to avoid him attending important functions\u2026 why are you guys together? \n\nAnd how is it any different when you aren\u2019t in public? If his feelings aren\u2019t a problem while alone, then they shouldn\u2019t be a problem when out with people. It\u2019s one thing if your partner just doesn\u2019t know how to behave in public, and is doing offensive things, or divulging personal information that hurts or violates you\u2026 but it\u2019s another thing to just have a personality that you find embarrassing, \u201csensitive\u201d seems to be describing the kind of people who aren\u2019t \u201ccool,\u201d and NOT the kind of people who harm anyone or make people upset\u2026 if what you mean is that he\u2019s just not cool enough in public, then double YTA.", "YTA - you don\u2019t understand how lucky you are to have a boyfriend who wants to be at these events for you and loves you so much that he\u2019s genuinely happy and gets emotional about these milestones in your life. Understand how many people would kill for their significant other to be like that.", "I feel like you should've communicated your feelings first, then decide if it was appropriate for him to show.", "Yta you really thought he was stupid enough to fall for your lies about a giant school event. Why do you even stay with him?", "Lying about ANYTHING is just plain wrong. How can anyone trust you? YES, YOU ARE THE ASS. I wouldn't blame him for dumping you after this stunt. What is the next lie going to be? YTA\nYOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED.", "YTA, poor fella. He obviously cares about you. Lying is not okay and being embarrassed of your significant other is even worse.", "Nta. I wouldnt want my special occasions to be sidelined by his uncontrollable emotions. Causing a scene at a baby shower and having to be removed to be calmed down sounds like way too much. If every event turning into a scene where I have to help my partner I would be exhausted and over it too.", "YTA, yes. So now you have to apologize and mend bridges, if you want him to trust you again.", "YTA you tricked/deceived your bf", "Damn. And here I am, wishing the men I had relationships with would have shown some sort of emotion.", "if you cant handle big emotions youre really not going to fare well in a childrens hospital lmfao. YTA.", "Yta. Need to be more honest and communicate. However, I can understand finding a grandiose display of emotion that is meant to be about you taxing and wanting to avoid it.", " YTA. My wife (then fianc\u00e9) would\u2019ve flipped out if I did what you did. You two need to figure this out. Residency is super stressful, especially at CHOP. Your SO will also be stressed.

That was a really, really mean way to treat him. He wanted to be there to show his love and support, and you were too focused on what others might possibly think? That's honestly just sad. \n\nCongrats on matching with your #1, but holy cow do you ever need to make it up to him. We see people constantly hurt by not having the support of their loved ones, and you just tossed his aside. I hope you two can talk and heal and move past this together.

I get where you're coming from because I used to be a lot like this, but if you keep people out of big moments in your life to avoid discomfort, it will push them away. I'd really suggest therapy to deal with these feelings so the same things don't happen in the future.\n\nCongratulations on the match!", "YTA that's a pretty big thing to not like about your boyfriend, but hey. Lying may have just solved this problem from ever occurring again.", "YTA. I would be devastated if my partner kept something big like that from me.

It's not his fault that he is an emotional man, I think that your pride is preventing you from appreciating him properly. So what if people think it's strange, that's their problem not yours. He is the man you love and you are prioritizing random strangers at an event over him.", ">I think I was just thinking about myself in that moment \n\nI could be misinterpreting, but is the issue less his emotions and more the stoplight shifts  to him and his big feelings? like, I can understand not wanting to be focused on calming down someone else when you should be celebrating the culmination of years of hard work.

Communication and trust are HUGE for a healthy relationship.", "Your thinking was clear. It is your ethics that are cloudy.", "But that is a conversation you need to have, how sometimes his big feelings cause stress for you.  He is entitled to his feelings and you\u2019re entitled to your peace, but people who love each other talk about their differences and find ways they\u2019re both comfortable, safe, and heard.

Based on what it was, I'd be shocked if there weren't a few family members reacting that way. It's completely normal. Maybe not common, but definitely normal. \n\nYou're so annoyed with him **being himself** that you actively excluded him, in a way that had to have been humiliating for him.

If he was bothered by it, he shouldn't have become this invested: someone who's like that isn't just going to stop being openly emotional one day. \n\nThis attitude towards his boyfriend is extremely disrespectful. If he didn't like it, that's something you decide a few months in. Not 4 years. It's not remotely fair to treat the boyfriend this way.", "They are both guys", "Is he able to calm himself down, or does the behaviour continue until others come to calm him down?", "OP said they had to go outside at her friend\u2019s baby shower to let him calm down because he was so overwhelmed. If he\u2019s getting very worked up in these situations then I definitely understand not always loving that, because it seems to leave potential for it to become about him and calming his feelings instead of the person that the event was actually meant to be about", "Just for clarification, there is no \u201cher\u201d in this story", "I totally missed that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Must be a sign I need to go to bed.", "I read that scenario differently. The people I've known with big emotions in that way don't **want** to be calmed down. I read it as OP deciding the boyfriend needed to chill, and enforcing a shallower reaction. \n\ni.e. the situation doesn't become about calming the boyfriend down if OP would just leave him be.", "oops sorry mistyped, I did read that it was M/M", "OP clarified it is usually noticeable and draws attention, so it\u2019s not necessarily fine to just leave it be. I wouldn\u2019t want my SO\u2019s huge displays of emotion to always overtake mine or other people\u2019s moments either", "Yta", "INFO: how are you planning to save your relationship after you openly showed him that he\u2019s not allowed to be part of your life?", "NTA I understand how someone who gets overly emotional at times can be exhausting and you wanted to be in a good head space and didn\u2019t have enough spoons to be entirely honest. You messed up but you can fix it. Explain it to him without being judgmental or bringing others into it. Best wishes and congratulations. \ud83c\udf8a", "NTA. Reading your comment about his bizarro crying fit a friend\u2019s baby shower put me firmly on your side. That sort of outsized emotional response is concerning. \n\nMaybe this is a sign it\u2019s time to end things. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid of sharing wonderful news and moments with your partner because he has wildly over the top emotional outbursts.", "I'll probably get down voted for this, but NTA.\n\nI think you should have been honest, and just set a boundary, but no one is entitled to be present for your important moments unless you want them to be. That was your moment, and you didn't want to have it be about him.\n\nAlthough I would suggest that you take some time to evaluate if you're really in the right relationship, if your partner is not the person you want to share those moments with.", "NTA the problem here is him making things about him during YOUR DAY  its fine to lie when the person you are lying to is going to be severely embarrassing at the event just break up okay dude good luck at your job. Also look at comments people he doesn't have a problem with patients just people hes close to", "YTA you're about to professionally have to tell a lot of people bad news and have hard conversations. Now's a good time to practice.", "NAH. I'm going to say it's not truly his business, and you told him well within a reasonable window. When people ask things they aren't necessarily entitled to know, I'm not going to judge people harshly on people who tell little lies.\n\nThat said, it doesn't sound like a healthy dynamic. He is putting too much emotional pressure on you, and you are avoiding him. While I'm not going to come down on you for a little white lie, you saw first-hand that it wasn't necessarily a good choice on your part. And why are you so embarrassed by emotions?", "Hmm you treat him the way I treat my parents. I just don\u2019t tell them things until after the fact because they just stress me out and not help at all. But it\u2019s definitely not the way I treat my spouse because unlike my parents, I got to choose my own partner. I had some non-dependable partners in the past and learned what to avoid. So glad I had my currently partner through the Meded journey. \nWhat I am trying to say is, I am sure your bf is great in so many ways. But would he be someone whom you can share your troubles with, be a dependent partner for not just the residency, but with having kids, which is as much challenge? Life is full of stressful events. Either you embrace your partner and learn to grow together, or find a different partner who doesn\u2019t stress you out when you are stressed.\nNo assholes here, just young adults learning about self and others.", "YTA. And a liar too. Just break up with him if he\u2019s so embarrassing to be around.", "Lol oh come on now, this is excessive.", "Okay, so this doesn't validate lying to him, but it certainly adds context. You two need to have a long conversation about this, maybe why his emotions are so big, and why you felt like you had to lie to him. There's is no excuse for the lie, but crying so hard you have to leave the room at a baby shower sounds like some kind of hormonal imbalance. Does he see a doctor regularly? It might be something to chat about?", "NTA, he sounds like an attention hogger.\n\nHe makes every situation about him.     \n\nYou are so busy consoling him that you can't even enjoy the moment.     \n\nSounds like one of the Brendan Fraser's character in Bewitched who was crying over sunsets.", "Does he have autism or something of the like?", "Hark at you, the appropriateness deemer.\nThe comment stands, break up with him rather than fuck with him.\n\nYTA", "If this is a problem then why do you continue seeing them?", "Good thing there are no emotions at a children\u2019s hospital", "And you decided to be a med student and applied to be matched at a children's hospital where these kids are full of emotion and feelings? You're telling me you have a hard time reacting to it or you're going to have a hard time?", "This is totally valid! NTA", "I highly doubt that. It's obvious that you can think clearly when you first decided to lie to him instead of having a serious conversation with him.", "Its not wrong to think about yourself okay", "*Having emotions isn't the problem, it's the expressing of them that troubles me.*\n\nAs someone who bottles up every ounce of emotion I've had in my life and also gets uncomfortable when people are demonstrative with theirs, you're still a massive AH in how you handled this. Hopefully you don't emote when you discover the impact this betrayal is likely to have on the health of your relationship.", "Agreed, I was with one. Everything is about him. Can you imagine being drained from residency and coming home to bf?", "No. He and even his family are self proclaimed cry connoisseurs", "This is ridiculous. 'You deal with big emotions as a pediatrician, social worker, grade school teacher so you should deal with the exact same emotions and outbursts from your own partner in your own home and important events. If not, go work in the boonies bro'", "Wrong comment but still", "OP said in another comment he caused such a scene at a friends baby shower while the Guest of Honour was opening presents that OP had to bring him outside to calm down.\nThis is not remotely normal behaviour.", "It\u2019s not normal behaviour, but my question still stands. If he is unable to calm himself, this requires intervention from a therapist because he\u2019s not learned self-soothing techniques as a child. If he only does it till the attention is on him and he\u2019s then able to calm quickly, it\u2019s a narcissistic behaviour. In this case, there\u2019s no point in trying interventions and OP just needs to leave.\n\nEdit: mis gendered", "The comments here are wild! I'm leaning towards ESH. You could have dealt with this in a less sneaky way but my god your bf needs to also realize it's unfair that you have to focus on comforting him when it should be a fun and wonderful time for you. I think if you sit down and have a serious discussion about it, really listen to each other you could come out stronger from this if you choose to stay together. Tell him how you truly feel, even if it's a hard conversation to have it's worth it. Congrats! Good luck!", "Is he an attention wh* re, or is he a genuinely overly emotional guy. Because there's a difference between wh* ring and genuine that should be handled differently. If it's genuine then that's a part of him, and if you can't handle it and think it's OK to not want to share your special events with him then you need to leave him so he can find someone who accepts him for who he is.\n\nIf it's the former you probably need to end things and find someone who can share things with you without narcissistic tendencies.\n\nA lasting relationship is one where you accept your partner. A short term relationship is one where you tolerate them.", "NTA he's an adult who needs to control his emotions", "YTA - you should have just told him about the stress and that you wanted to go alone.\n\nYou just doubled down on the potential negative feelings you gave your bf by lying.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable having these kinds of discussions either you need to get used to talking about things and do some growing up, or if its just him you can't talk like this to maybe look into why.", "Yta but if he\u2019s too much for you, end things here. If he\u2019s a burden to you, you cant keep him in your life", "Lies always make things worse than the circumstances the liar presumed would of happened had they been honest. Trying to protect yourself at the expense of your partner will not build a solid foundation, but will build unhealthy resentment. Trust is must, embarrassment is fleeting.", "YTA because you lied. Talk to each others people ffs.", "YTA big time!!!! He wanted to be there to love and support you during what was a very important time in your life and you told him with your actions that you didn't want him there. How hurtful and disrespectful a way to handle it.", "NTA", "I think gender neutral posting is a must in AITA", "YTA\nYour boyfriend being emotional is embarrassing to you? That's pretty problematic and likely something you should look into. But it's definitely not cause to lie to him especially when he's trying to support you.", "First - Congratulations on getting your first Choice !\n\nES - you were already well wound up about the event and it was a potentially explosive situation.  Not everybody is good having this as a group event.  Some people need time to deal with potential grief situation.  He shouldn't think that his feelings mattered more than your feelings.  Sure its nice that he was supportive but he could be supportive of you needing to do this alone - if only for an hour or two", "YTA. You stood him up much like it was a date. I'm curious what the talk is going to be about.", "NTA \u2026. At first I was iffy but after reading your responses to people, definitely NTA.  The BOY needs to grow up/ get therapy/ learn to self regulate.  It is OK for anyone to be emotional BUT when it is done in such a manner as to divert attention from others (OP or Mom to Be for example) and on to himself it is childish, self centered, rude, disrespectful and so much more.  \nTBH you are starting your Medical Career and he will be nothing but a dead weight for you emotionally, mentally and quite possibly professionally.  Please take time and talk to someone yourself and do some major internal and intentional reflection on this relationship.  \n\nBTW CONGRATS!!!!!", "I know several  docs at CHOP they all love the place. Congratulations  and thanks from all those lucky kids.", "I hope he splits up with you and ends up with someone that isn't ashamed of him.", "ESH - everyone sucks here works for this case", "But by the time the boyfriend caused the scene, OP had had time to process the news and be emotionally available to deal with his emotions. So it is not an equivalent outcome. \n\nHaving the hard conversation beforehand may have required more emotional bandwidth that was available at the time.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend should figure out that not everything is about him.", "To be fair to OP, until that envelope is opened it might not be a happy moment.", "Are you sure it isn't that you don't want to deal with *him*?\n\nIt seems like *all* of the times you could talk to or interact with him about this are the wrong times.  Why are you so stuck on convincing yourself that you're happy but us that you aren't? Figure out which one you are- happy or not- with *****who he is right this second, without changing anything at all***** and then move forward accordingly. \n\nIt sounds like you may be doing him and yourself a massive disservice by trying to keep this ship sailing long after it ran ashore.", "I do t understand why this comment is getting downvoted", "He's explained that it's not the boyfriends emotions, it's the fact that in crying he takes the spotlight from him and his day would go from celebrating his accomplishment to having to focus on his boyfriends crying instead. Like he cried so much at a baby shower that he had to be removed, from just seeing her open gifts?? It's a bit attention seeking.", "She\u2019s the AH for the way she went about it, and you know that. If you can\u2019t communicate with your partner then break up with them. They aren\u2019t married it\u2019s a clean break. If you feel like you have to hide your special moments from your partner, why would you want to be with them?", "Soooooo break up with him?", "This is a weird thing to say about oneself.  Is this a competition his family has to see who can get the most attention?  It's like they're ... bragging almost?\n\nI can see how it would be disturbing to the other people on their happy day if your BF was having a full-on, inconsolable cry in the middle of the crowd. \n\nThat could quickly turn things from \"Yay!\" to \"Oh my God, is that guy OK? Is he hurt? Does he need help?\"\n\nIf he's crying during parties, shows, etc., it may be a kindness to him to NOT expose him to situations that cause him this level of distress until he's had the chance to talk to a therapist about coping techniques.\n\nNot everyone will be comfortable with a grown man in tears, especially if it interrupts the point of the gathering.  And you won't be comfortable knowing that at any moment, he may need to be taken out.  There's a lot to unpack there. Couples therapy might be the way to do that.", "For whatever reason, he has learned this behavior. That you mention his family makes me wonder if he had to have Bigger Better Feelings in order to get attention for his needs as a child. \n\nBut he is **not** a child **now**. And others around him have needs. And you are going to be on a long, long road of feeling depleted and needing him to be stable for you (med school residency, then medical practice).  You can\u2019t always be the one in charge of regulating the emotional climate. Parity is needed.", "*he - both are men", "*he. They're both men.", "Thanks. I\u2019ll correct. I forgot to check the genders again when I answered."]}
