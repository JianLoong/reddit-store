Match day is YOUR accomplishment, and you don\u2019t have to share the initial moment it happens, even with your significant other. You knew he would likely become overly emotional and ruin it for you so you decided to tell him it was later in the day so that wouldn\u2019t happen.

I get where you were coming from- sometimes you want to find out important news privately. But lying was unnecessary, he was probably so excited for you and you crushed that.\n\nCongrats on your match.", "YTA for lying to your partner.\n\nI have a partner who can be pretty weird and not themselves in certain professional group settings to the point where I can feel embarrassed. Most of the time I can accept this because who cares. However there are times I am bothered a lot by it-- usually because I am very stressed or insecure around said people we are going to be around (colleagues, judgemental peers, people i don't know well, etc.).\n\nWe talked about it together, and it was really helpful for me to acknowledge my own anxiety and fear of judgement from others that is creating the embarrassment. This stems from childhood bullying. However, my partner also acknowledges she can be pretty weird when she gets anxious. Then it's not a fun time for either of us. Me explaining my feelings went over pretty well. Now we communicate more if it's a good idea for her to attend certain things that I'm feeling super worried about. Half the time she is neutral about attending these things, and doesn't care that much.\n\nI would never deny her something if she was super into it out of fear of embarrassment. The stuff above is all like optional social/professional situations. I would definitely want them there to support and celebrate with me during big events like match day. She is my rock.  I wouldn't care what other people were doing.\n\nIf you can't have a partner to cry with you or celebrate with you what is the point?", "YTA. Why have you been with someone for four years if you can\u2019t communicate with them honestly or have difficult conversations with them? Are you going to spend a lifetime being ashamed of them?", "As someone who also recently matched (congrats btw). I\u2019ll give you a very soft YTA. Most people can\u2019t fathom how much work and time it took to get to that momentous day and I totally understand not wanting to have to deal with your boyfriend during it. That being said, this is a huge thing that also affects him and he deserved at least a conversation around it prior to being left out.", "Yes, YTA for actually lying.\n\nYour post's title is misleading.  You DID lie to him, and that makes you the AH.", "YTA\n\nWhat other important life events will you want to exclude him from?", "YTA. You\u2019re embarrassed by the sincerity and care of the person you claim to love. You clearly care more about what some people might possibly (probably not) think than about sharing an incredibly emotional moment with your closest person. That\u2019s tragic. I hope  you find healing, OP. And I hope part of that is a sincere apology to your boyfriend.", "YTA, so what if your boyfriend has big emotions?\n\nhe feels he freely to be himself/safe around you, and instead you feel embarrassed? he was proud of you and wanted to celebrate you, so you lied to save your own feelings, of COURSE he would be upset, cause you lied\n\ngive him time to decide what he wants to do, and he\u2019ll return your calls when he wants to, you lied so you get the consequences of having to wait and let him be ready to talk to you", "Can I do a half and half? Like YTA for lying but NTA if he takes away from the event. This is a big moment and you (and other participants) deserve to be have a second to be proud of yourself and going the direction you planned for yourself. You worked really hard to get here. I\u2019m all for happy tears and tears of support but you shouldn\u2019t have to stop celebrating to calm him down or reassure others that he is fine. You also shouldn\u2019t have to leave your event so he isn\u2019t disrupting others. \n\nBut also you need to have a conversation about what\u2019s going on. He should be able to manage himself emotionally and you should be able to have that conversation. Crying is fine but the length, loudness, and attention it takes away is excessive. If you love him, you should be able to talk about this. It wasn\u2019t nice what you did but hopefully you can figure it out.", "YTA. Lying accomplishes nothing.", "YTA. I feel so bad for him. If his emotions are embarrassing to you, why are you even with him?", "YTA. You lied to someone who needs to be able to implicitly trust you. Intimate, romantic relationships involve so much trust, and trust is delicate. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest, if you are embarrassed by him being himself and having feelings, especially to the point of lying to avoid him attending important functions\u2026 why are you guys together? \n\nAnd how is it any different when you aren\u2019t in public? If his feelings aren\u2019t a problem while alone, then they shouldn\u2019t be a problem when out with people. It\u2019s one thing if your partner just doesn\u2019t know how to behave in public, and is doing offensive things, or divulging personal information that hurts or violates you\u2026 but it\u2019s another thing to just have a personality that you find embarrassing, \u201csensitive\u201d seems to be describing the kind of people who aren\u2019t \u201ccool,\u201d and NOT the kind of people who harm anyone or make people upset\u2026 if what you mean is that he\u2019s just not cool enough in public, then double YTA.", "YTA - you don\u2019t understand how lucky you are to have a boyfriend who wants to be at these events for you and loves you so much that he\u2019s genuinely happy and gets emotional about these milestones in your life. Understand how many people would kill for their significant other to be like that.", "I feel like you should've communicated your feelings first, then decide if it was appropriate for him to show.", "Yta you really thought he was stupid enough to fall for your lies about a giant school event. Why do you even stay with him?", "Lying about ANYTHING is just plain wrong. How can anyone trust you? YES, YOU ARE THE ASS. I wouldn't blame him for dumping you after this stunt. What is the next lie going to be? YTA\nYOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED.", "YTA, poor fella. He obviously cares about you. Lying is not okay and being embarrassed of your significant other is even worse.", "Nta. I wouldnt want my special occasions to be sidelined by his uncontrollable emotions. Causing a scene at a baby shower and having to be removed to be calmed down sounds like way too much. If every event turning into a scene where I have to help my partner I would be exhausted and over it too.", "YTA, yes. So now you have to apologize and mend bridges, if you want him to trust you again.", "YTA you tricked/deceived your bf", "Damn. And here I am, wishing the men I had relationships with would have shown some sort of emotion.", "if you cant handle big emotions youre really not going to fare well in a childrens hospital lmfao.

My wife (then fianc\u00e9) would\u2019ve flipped out if I did what you did. You two need to figure this out. Residency is super stressful, especially at CHOP. Your SO will also be stressed.

That was a really, really mean way to treat him. He wanted to be there to show his love and support, and you were too focused on what others might possibly think? That's honestly just sad. \n\nCongrats on matching with your #1, but holy cow do you ever need to make it up to him.

I get where you're coming from because I used to be a lot like this, but if you keep people out of big moments in your life to avoid discomfort, it will push them away. I'd really suggest therapy to deal with these feelings so the same things don't happen in the future.\n\nCongratulations on the match!", "YTA that's a pretty big thing to not like about your boyfriend, but hey. Lying may have just solved this problem from ever occurring again.", "YTA. I would be devastated if my partner kept something big like that from me.

Maybe not common, but definitely normal. \n\nYou're so annoyed with him **being himself** that you actively excluded him, in a way that had to have been humiliating for him.

OP can appologise for not handling this ideally when OP was managing their own emotions  but he needs to step up and get control or get support from specialists, or he needs to come to terms with the reality that because he cannot handle reality, he's not entitled to all the realities of OP's life, and they should probably break up.\n\nEdit: fixed misgenders of OP", "Exactly what I was coming here to say. You worked hard to match at CHOP you deserved to enjoy the moment.  \n\nWhen he is done over reacting you can explain this to him. If you don\u2019t see his behavior change, perhaps consider if you get enough support to warrant staying in the relationship.", "I think that person meant dramatic, but agreed nonetheless.", "But, that does not take away from what I said. If you're over the top dramatic displays of emotion are literally taking focus away from the guests of honor at an event, then you don't get to be surprised when you're no longer invited to those events. As an adult it is your job to regulate your emotions, there is a time and place for everything. And an event where you are not the guest of honor, is not the place to steal attention. However intentionally or unintentionally.", "Yes, they broke up then and there and will never have any more conversations for the rest of their lives.", "So simply because he is going to be working at a children's hospital that automatically means he has to now essentially do the duty of a parent towards his partner, and help him regulate his emotions because he never learned how himself? Because that's what it seems like here. Having to constantly monitor and regulate your partners in motion so that they don't get overworked and steal a spotlight from everyone else, is not the work of a partner. That is the work of a parent.", "Words to live by!!", "Well yes the boyfriend would be crying about their success, eventually it would get to a point where they would have to ignore their own success in their own feelings in order to calm down their boyfriend or remove their boyfriend from the event. It's already happened once, at an event that was honoring neither of them. So who's to say it wouldn't be even worse or even bigger, if the event is honoring one of them? \nBottom line, if OP has to sacrifice their achievements and their feelings, and events they've been invited to in order to help regulate their partners emotions, then that's not healthy. That's not acceptable. That seems more like being a parent than a partner.", "OP already stated that they don't have an issue with their partner being emotional, it's when they take it over the top and draw every ounce of attention towards them. As they mentioned in another comment, their boyfriend during a baby shower where the guest of honor was open gifts, started sobbing and crying so loudly, and for so long they actually had to take them outside, in order to calm them down. That is excessive. There's emotional, and then there's over the top emotional. And not everyone can handle over the top emotional all the time, especially in public, and double that when the event is supposed to be for you not for them. \nThere is nothing wrong with being emotional, I'm emotional, I barely have a grip on my emotions. But I can even recognize that there is a time and place for those really big emotions, and sometimes you have to be able to control them. If you can't, then that's something that you need to work on, not something that you put on your partner to just accept and deal with.", "That is not being emotional that\u2019s lacking basic emotional regulation. You teach that to children .", "This is so patronising to men. As if having emotions is an excuse to be inappropriate with them.", "It's not about the tears. It's about the fact that OP then has to ignore their feelings and their own achievements, and whatever event they've been invited to in order to help their partner regulate their emotions. That's not healthy partnership behavior. That is the The behavior of a parent and child. Adults know how to regulate their own emotions, and if they can't they can remove themselves from the event. Barring extreme circumstances like grief or something like that.\nBut if you as an adult cannot manage to remove yourself from an event, because you can't show a proper display of emotion, which includes not drawing everyone's attention to you especially at an event that's not for you, then you Don't get to get mad when people don't want you to come to stuff anymore. Because you are not doing the work to make sure that you are healthy enough to be in those situations.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with being an emotional person, I'm an emotional person myself. But, there is a time and place for everything. And an event that's not for you, is not the place to be drawing all of the attention to yourself, because you never learned how to regulate yourself.", "How dare he want an event where the focus is on her; selfish woman.", "That\u2019s a pretty unkind thing to say to a stranger. Especially now that we know that what he was trying to avoid was his boyfriend taking ops positive event and having a big emotional reaction to make it about him. The guy had to be escorted out of a baby shower for crying in a way that attracted attention for 20 min while the mother to be opened presents", "OP also clarified that he has hangups about emotional reactions, which suggests he may be exaggerating: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x4j8e/aita_for_not_lying_to_my_boyfriend_about_my_match/jd1ekuy\n\nI read the baby shower example differently. It's one thing if the boyfriend was actually overwhelmed and wanted to be calmed, but OP didn't indicate that. Based on his stated hangups, it seems more likely that OP decided that the boyfriend is too embarrassing and decided that his emotion level should come down. \n\nIt seems relevant that he hasn't mentioned getting complaints; i.e. his friends from prior asking to limit the BF's presence at events like these. Which suggests that OP is **assuming** his boyfriend is drawing attention.\n\nIt's also highly relevant that they've been together for years. If it had been a few months and OP was trying to figure out if he can cope with these emotional responses, that's one thing. But this is a fundamental part of who the boyfriend is; he knows and is aware of it. He didn't decide it makes them incompatible; instead he's trying to change his boyfriend, actively excluding him from things they should share as a couple, and lying to him in a particularly hurtful and embarrassing way. \n\nIn combination with the comment I linked to in the previous post, it's clear he doesn't respect his boyfriend. I have a strong feeling that if the boyfriend were posting his own AITA, we'd hear a very different perspective about a boyfriend trying to suppress him.", "\u201cNah-ah-ah!\nI wish to be the most EMOTIONALLY sensitive man in the world\u201d\n\n\u201cOh darn, I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t catch that. I could\u2019ve had a lot of fun with that one.\u201d", "Corrected! Thank you!", "Thanks for pointing it out! I've corrected my comment!", "I\u2019m glad you recognize that. But I also understand how there comes a point where if someone displays too much emotion it distracts from the main event, and starts becoming about them.", "Oh so they manage to make everything about themselves. I read your baby shower comment and it sounds like you wanted to celebrate your match. Congrats!!!\n\nI think you should talk to him about the fact that it's not that he gets emotional it's that he requires attention away from the person of honor. I mean if I were that mom to be I'd be pretty pissed and maybe some guests were wondering if there was a secret affair. \n\nHe has to learn to manage his own emotions. You won't have time to do it \n\nNTA", "You mean there's MORE THAN ONE of this guy? What the fuck? That would be more than I could handle, personally.", "Ah, true.", "\"about this\"; did you not finish the sentence?  It isn't very long", "he said himself that he and his family are \u201cCry Connoisseurs.\u201d and he has shown that any emotional event where he is not the focus will turn into an event where he will be the focus.\n\nyou suck for how you went about this, but also consider that this behavior will repeat itself\u2026*forever* (unless he chooses to go to therapy, which i kinda doubt bc this behavior has been normalized in his family).\n\nit\u2019s emotionally (& at times physically!) exhausting having to manage someone else\u2019s emotions for them.", "I think best scenario would have been to sit him down beforehand and say you'd love him to be with you for the event, but that he would need to bring his own support person to console him, as you want to be allowed to feel whatever emotions you need to first without having to prioritize his, given that it is your special day.\n\nRather than Y T A, I'm gonna say ESH because I do think his behavior (at your friend's baby shower for example) is spotlight stealing whether he intends it or not, and he needs to know when to control himself better", "Did you see this comment where OP said he's just not comfortable with big emotional reactions? https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x4j8e/aita_for_not_lying_to_my_boyfriend_about_my_match/jd1ekuy He's made a few other comments about this throughout. \n\nIt doesn't sound like the boyfriend's emotions are hijacking events; it sounds like OP is deciding to make these events about the BF out of embarrassment. i.e. OP is hijacking these events because of his own hangups. \n\nEven in the baby shower example, he didn't indicate that his boyfriend wanted or needed to be calmed down. He decided his BF needed to be calmed. Based on OP's comments, I don't trust his ability to judge what an \"inappropriate\" level of emotion is--he's admitted to having hangups about big emotions and not being emotionally mature enough to address it appropriately. \n\nTo be clear: some people find emotional displays to be annoying. It's fine to be annoyed by that. It's not fine to continue dating someone like that for years with the hope of changing who they are fundamentally, excluding them from important milestones because of it, and lying to them because their personality is too much to deal with. It's callous. Foolish. And unfair to the BF, who could find someone who appreciates him.", ">That\u2019s a pretty unkind thing to say to a stranger.\n\nWelcome to the Internet.", "Residency hours are brutal, and if he can't change, then I'm going with the unpopular decision for her to make a final decision. It all depends on op, is she willing for him to be the main character in her life, achievement, and celebration?\n\nI couldn't do it.", "This isn\u2019t just being emotional but being obnoxious. Emotional regulation is a thing.", "Sometimes things don\u2019t seem like a big problem until after we\u2019re deeply invested.", "Yes I most definitely meant dramatic.

He seems to strongly resent and be embarrassed by his boyfriend. You don't reach that point unless it's been an ongoing issue. The fact that he decided to lie to avoid the problem says he hasn't been communicating with his boyfriend prior, to let it be known that it's a point of conflict that needs to be navigated.\n\nBecause of his own hangups, it seems likely that he's exaggerating--based on his assumptions of how others are reacting internally--his BF's emotional reactions. It sounds more like he's being controlling of his boyfriend's emotions that, while more open than most people, fits within a fairly normal variation.", "He also clarified that he has hangups about emotional reactions: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x4j8e/aita_for_not_lying_to_my_boyfriend_about_my_match/jd1ekuy\n\nIf someone has admitted hangups about emotional reactions, why should their claim that someone's emotions are inappropriate and drawing attention be taken at face value? \n\ni.e. isn't it more likely that someone with hangups about emotional displays is going to misperceive others' reactions as an exaggeration of his own feelings?"]}
