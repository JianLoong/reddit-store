It\u2019s a big house on a farm in the middle of nowhere. It\u2019s  beautiful but slightly creepy because of how old and run down and secluded it is. The people who live in this house are myself (f24), my husband, John, (m37), my brother in law (m38) and his wife (f25), my other brother so in law (m42 and m26) and my father in law (m60).\nI\u2019m a stay at home wife, hopefully, mother soon (we\u2019re trying) and my sister in law and I are responsible for the house while the guys work on the farm. It\u2019s a very traditional family. Something I wasn\u2019t quite used to.\n\nWithin a few days, I\u2019ve noticed that the house, including our bedroom, living room and bathroom had cameras installed. It made me extremely uncomfortable and I confronted my husband about this.\n\nHe told me it\u2019s for safety and not to worry about it. I questioned cameras in the bathroom and he said those were just fakes and to drop the subject. I did because his tone told me he didn\u2019t want to discuss it any further.\n\nBut the cameras kept bugging me and after a few days, I covered them up. I felt weird being under constant camera presences.\n\nWhen my husband got home he asked me to come to our bedroom and he was furious. He started shouting at me that I had no right to change anything in his family home. He said he already told me to ignore the cameras. \n\nI questioned the cameras again and explained how they made me feel but he asked me if I didn\u2019t trust him. I said that I trusted him. He asked if I trusted his family, I said that I did. Then he said \u201csee, there\u2019s no problem then. Only family has access to these cameras.\u201d I tried telling him that it wasn\u2019t better but he told me to never touch the cameras again and to stop being a problem.\n\nThe next morning, no one would talk to me. Including my sister in law. When we were alone, she told me to stop making a mess and that she can\u2019t talk to me as that\u2019s punishment for being disrespectful. She told me to stop being an asshole and listen to John and not get her involved in my marital problems.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was being an asshole, I only tried to express my feeling and that this made me feel uncomfortableness. But everyone in the house thinks I\u2019m in the wrong and I\u2019m confused. Am I really the asshole for covering up the cameras?\n\nPs. My apologies for any mistakes. English isn\u2019t my first language and I\u2019m typing this on my phone and my autocorrect can get weird sometimes.", "created_utc": 1669576257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z69nu6/aita_for_covering_up_cameras_in_the_living_room/", "score": 1533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is priming you for further abuse, you should leave him or it WILL get worse.", "Okay, so\u2026 here\u2019s the thing. \n\nCameras in the living room, I can get for security. Cameras in the bedroom\u2026 I\u2019ve heard of it, it\u2019s not THAT unusual, I can justify that as security too, if a bit paranoid - to me, anyway. Cameras in the BATHROOM, though - THAT is odd. Not just odd, creepy. Downright strange. I don\u2019t buy that they\u2019re fakes. (More on that last point later).\n\nA traditional family, I can understand. Doing farm work, it\u2019s a simple life, I can get that too - some people are into the simple life. All the women staying at home, I mean it\u2019s a little odd, but if the family is sufficiently traditional and simple I could maybe see it? But it\u2019s still very strange to me, and slightly creepy. (More on THAT soon).\n\nHere\u2019s the soon and the later, and the part that paints it all together for me as something genuinely sinister. You all move to the family home once married, right? I\u2019m assuming that because you did and so did the other woman - once marrying into the family, you are MADE to move into the TRADITIONAL family home where you live surrounded by cameras and are subservient to the men? And Mother-in-Law is gone, right - again, on its own, not that extraordinary. People divorce and separate all the time. In this context though, where people seemingly just come to live at this family home where there are cameras everywhere and women stay at home and do housework, THAT seems a bit\u2026 I dunno, like a red flag? She saw something there? Or, yknow, straight up: what happened to her?\n\nI ask that because I see a Father-in-Law at 60, living with his sons, 26, 37, 38, and 42. Two of the sons, both in their late thirties, are married to women in their mid twenties, age-wise around or right after the time brain stops developing, and depending on the degree\u2026 potentially straight out of college. Both marriages have an over ten year age differential between the men and women. That\u2019s creepy, right? On its own, when it\u2019s one guy like a Leo, that\u2019s strange, less than preferable, kinda creepy. When it\u2019s two men, both brothers, both living in. a \u2018traditional\u2019 home with cameras everywhere, that\u2019s capital-C creepy, man. \n\nThe only other woman there though seems paranoid, and asks you to stop digging, she can\u2019t talk to you because\u2026 there is punishment? Because that is punishment?\n\nSo just\u2026 stick with me. When the cameras are everywhere, including the bathroom and bedrooms, in a traditional family home with two young women both married to middle aged men who are brothers, that\u2019s SINISTER. \n\nThe traditional family home is a bit odd on its own - when it\u2019s home to two couples, the men being brothers of similar ages, both married to women who are NOT similar ages to the men but ARE to EACHOTHER, and BOTH are early/mid twenties? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s creepy. That\u2019s SINISTER, sinister, like what? And after marriage, you move into the home that has just everyone in it? No other women apart from the other girl, a father and four sons? And cameras everywhere? That\u2019s hardly traditional traditional, we\u2019re not talking amish, this is like\u2026 this is something else. \n\nWhen the only other woman there tells you to NOT ask about the cameras, or talk to her about your problems, because there is either punishment for being disrespectful OR no-one can talk to you as YOUR punishment for being disrespectful?! THAT is fucking CREEPY, man. THEY\u2019RE ALL HAPPENING HERE, TOGETHER. \n\nEach thing on its OWN crosses the line in their respective category into creepiness level, AS SAID AT THE START! And they\u2019re all happening AT THIS PLACE, AT THE SAME TIME. Fucking RUN and do not look back.

You don't know them as well.\n\n2. Even if you do trust them, the question that the husband is asking is irrelevant. Is not a matter of trust, is a matter of privacy and being/feeling violated. He is deflecting your concerns; it's gaslighting and is a form of violence. If your husband cared about you, he would put your sense of wellbeing above something as stupid as having cameras in the bathroom.\n\nAs an example, I trust my partner, my siblings and my parents. I don't give them access to my email account or my phone.\n\n3. A secluded farm sounds bad. It appears you are away from the people you trust, and whatever happens, the men in that family control everything. They control the money, the household, the narrative of what's happening, and it seems you are falling under that control. It's unhealthy.\n\n4. Honestly, it's not a common thing to have cameras in the bathrooms and bedrooms. Usually cameras are installed on entrances (front and back door), and in certain common spaces (patio, living room). Having a camera in the kitchen is already rare enough, let alone restroom or bedroom.\n\n5. Do you have access to the camera footage? Is there a a log of who access that footage?
