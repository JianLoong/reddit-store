They had a rocky relationship at times but overall my friends and I viewed them as a \u201cgolden standard\u201d. That was until about 2 months ago when my friends and I found proof of her cheating. We gave her every opportunity to come clean to at least us (her supposed best friends) and she lied at every turn. Throughout their entire relationship Katy had us keep small lies from James and we all finally had enough. So as a collective we decided to divide and conquer. On group was going to confront Katy while the other told James the truth. At the end of all of this Katy confessed and we all stayed friends since she knew she was wrong and her and James were going to try and work it out. Fast forward a couple weeks and Katy continues to cheat on James and they finally break up. Katy doesn\u2019t blame any of us but now her parents hate everyone involved.

If her parents can't accept that then F them.  If my friends had solid proof my partner was cheating then I would be very pissed if they said nothing in like 99% of the possible cases.  Sure, if I am on my death bed - keep that to yourself and let me die ignorant.", "NTA, but I also would not be referring to them as a \"best friend.\"", "NTA - You guys did all the right step for James and gave Katy a chance to quit the cheating bullshit.  Katy continued to cheat.  Let James know, again and if he isn't a fool he can permanately dump her this time.  As far as her parents go that will no longer be a problem for you as the rest you are going to throw Katy to the curb as well.  She and they will then be out of your lives, James will hopefully get over the cheater Katy and find a new relationship.", "NTA She ruined it,  not you.  Cheaters deserve to be revealed.", "NTA.  Ask yourself this one simple question:  'if my SO was cheating on me, would I want to know'?", "NTA thank you for telling James you are good people & its sad to hear he gave her a second chance & she still betrayed him again & again\n\nIMO Katy is a person I wouldnt want in my life to ever have the chance of her being a role model/influence on me, hopefully her parents know the truth & don't just hate you because she spun her web of lies to them too.. I  would make sure they saw the proof & block Katy&Parents & all would be right in the world..\n\n\nWhatever you decide I wish you the best of luck and remember be kind to one another", "ESH, except maybe James. \n\nThe group planning out confrontation and revelation events feels super gross and intrusive. A friend counseling another friend is normal friendship stuff. Your thing seems performative, like someone wants to use it for online content.

I thought Katy did that all by herself...\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nI don't know why you'd even question this if *Katy* doesn't blame any of you.
