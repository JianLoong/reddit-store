My mother is upset and thinks I should let it go and pretend nothing happened. I\u2019ve been doing that for over 20 years and I\u2019m honestly done. I feel bad because I really love my mom and don\u2019t want her to feel sad on Christmas. \n\nThey also spent a lot of money on the travel expenses and room reservations that I\u2019m now abandoning 4 days early. \n\nPerhaps I should also mention that I can be a little moody at times. I\u2019ve somewhat recently been through a tough breakup, and I\u2019m not always feeling sociable. However, I would never dream of speaking to someone the way my stepfather spoke to my mother and I this morning. I told him that and he responded with \u201cget used to it\u201d before locking himself in his bedroom.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My dad has an anger problem of his own. They can't be reasoned with at times. Holding up a mirror up to them is the only way to get it though their scull.

It\u2019s understandable to be yours as well. \n\nIf your step dad is heated enough to cross your boundary with his words\u2026 well you said anger issues so hard to know how physical this could become, and unlikely to be resolved today/now. You clearly expressed a boundary and he doubled down. It\u2019s up in the air what other boundaries could be crossed.\n\nBUT- it\u2019s unclear why they were arguing. He\u2019s just a jerk? This is how they talk before getting frisky? Who knows, don\u2019t walk into other peoples conflict and imply you\u2019d like to join (you asked what the issue was, better to stay in your room/take a walk/anything but sit down and start talking). Definitely don\u2019t insert yourself into your mother\u2019s marriage.\n\nI\u2019d invite your mom to breakfast tomorrow or to exchange gifts back at your hotel room (which is a good idea to leave the scene of conflict). Your mother is clearly your priority for your trip anyway. Step dad not invited if he\u2019s going to cross boundaries, and mom needs to come visit you in the future unless step dad wants to learn how to respect your boundaries. Relationships are managed with expectations, boundaries, and consequences. Not your job to train a 68 year old, and it\u2019s your mom\u2019s choice what she wants to put up with and not an obligation on your part, just don\u2019t distance from mom or she\u2019ll feel isolated and closer to step dad.\n\nAnyone tries to pin a \u2018ruined trip\u2019 or anything else on you, \u201cmy only mistake was asking what was going on, it was his choice to escalate- and I don\u2019t know what other boundaries such an angry person would cross.\u201d", "NTA.

Do not regret it. \n\nI felt at her older age, us long moved out, she wasn't looking to be single and just put up with it to have someone there and not be alone.
