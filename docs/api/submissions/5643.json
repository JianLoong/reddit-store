My mother is upset and thinks I should let it go and pretend nothing happened. I\u2019ve been doing that for over 20 years and I\u2019m honestly done. I feel bad because I really love my mom and don\u2019t want her to feel sad on Christmas. \n\nThey also spent a lot of money on the travel expenses and room reservations that I\u2019m now abandoning 4 days early. \n\nPerhaps I should also mention that I can be a little moody at times. I\u2019ve somewhat recently been through a tough breakup, and I\u2019m not always feeling sociable. However, I would never dream of speaking to someone the way my stepfather spoke to my mother and I this morning.
