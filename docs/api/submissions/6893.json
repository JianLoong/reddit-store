{"id": 6893, "submission_id": "107czu8", "title": "AITA for having much more food than initially though at my SIL birthday party?", "selftext": "A few years ago I (34M) moved to a different country with my wife (31F) but I always like to come back to visit my family during the Christmas period. Like for many other families, Christmas and the following days for us has always been a time for celebrating and having A LOT of food at my mom's. This year it was even more exaggerated for me. Recently I started weight lifting and my hunger has gone up quite significantly so during the holidays I basically ate the portion of 2/3 people without any guilt. In all of this it might be indeed important to add that I am a perfectly healthy weight and that I normally have a very healthy and balanced diet.\n\nDuring these holidays on the contrary my brother (38M) and my SIL (32F) were very moderate. They noticed that they were starting to put on some weight and they watched very closely what they ate. Nothing to complain, good for them. They also noticed and commented on how much I was eating.\n\nIn early January it was my SIL birthday and she decided to invite my wife, my mom and myself to her house and we gladly accepted. It might be helpful to point out that their house is in a fairly remote area and buying groceries for me is not very convenient. Then when we got there the menu was...underwhelming to say the least. She just cooked some very basic food, with smaller portions and some left overs. Both my wife and I were fairly perplexed but we didn't complain. My SIL still noticed that we were not exactly joyful so she offered us some more food that she bought for them and for her kids for the next days. At that point it was quite late and my wife were getting hungrier and hungrier so we ended up eating all that food that apparently was supposed to last for dinner and for the next day for the whole family (them + their kids). My SIL made us notice by saying that now they had to make a long trip to buy groceries again.\n\nThere was no fighting or arguing over this but I could clearly see that my SIL and my brother were not very happy about us so I wonder...AITA for basically eating much more food that they planned to offer? Should I have been more considerate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: something worth adding. What I had after the initial (in my opinion crappy) lunch, was not \"great\". I was not having that food because it was great and out of gluttony, but just because I was really hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: my wife doesn't work out and she still had much more food than initially served. That was makes me think that yes, the portions were really really small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  I think it might also be helpful to add some times to this. We were invited for lunch and we showed up around 12 as required. They were late and served us food around 1. We had the poor, light lunch basically until 2 and at that time I was offered more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since a lot of people in the comments mention reimbursing them. The extra-food I (we) had on that day was basically brought (and bought) by my mom on the same day. They don't have any money issue. The main problem for them is that it is inconvenient going to the nearby town to buy more food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I prefer to avoid putting the exact menu here for several reason (main one, it's local food, not very well known outside of my home country) but I would say what I was initially given was approximately 500 calories. What I had in the end was maybe almost 2000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since I've been asked multiple times. My wife and I brought them a plant for my SIL and some sweets for the whole family as a gift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I need to clarify this better I think. We had the lunch that my SIL prepared, after that my wife and I were still hungry. We didn't say anything (not to my SIL, not to each other) but my SIL understood we were still hungry (maybe because we didn't give her any compliment about the food? I don't know) and so she took out some stuff which didn't need to be prepared out of the fridge, put it on the table and offered it to us.

They guessed (correctly) it was a problem and they offered to fix it.", "While OP is a whiny ass over having a small lunch a single time, whether or not a 500kcal serving is a normal amount heavily depends on several circumstances (size of the involved people, for one, calorie density as well). It could be akin to a single BigMac - and I honestly don't know a lot of people that would be satisfied after a BigMac and nothing else. It could've also been a veggie platter to snack on and I don't know a lot of people who can easily eat 500 kcal worth of veggies in a single sitting and demand the same amount twice more.\n\nThe thing is, it doesn't really matter, does it? OP won't starve from eating a smaller than usual lunch once. Drink a glass of water or two to keep you semi-filled until you're home and then make a huge portion of food there if you require that. I eat once a day, I essentially scarf down 2.5-3k kcal in a single sitting (I'm rather active in my day2day) - yet you won't see me eating an entire party sub all on my own or demand my hosts cook me additional meals. I can absolutely deal with a \"small\" portion of food for some time. Will I be hungry? Yeah. Can I deal with being hungry for some time like a big boy? Definitely.
