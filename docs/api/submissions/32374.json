Facebook is still the only social media I use. But my husband (62M) suggested that I should create an account here and ask Reddit if I\u2019m the AH. \n\nSo here goes.\n\nMy daughter and her wife (36F) eloped in 2016. She came out to me 10 years before that, so I\u2019d already come to terms with the fact that she wasn\u2019t going to marry a man and have a traditional wedding. But I was really upset when she went behind my back and got married without telling me. \n\nAnyway, fast-forward to two years ago. I was up late and loopy from my Ambien. I was scrolling through Facebook and commented on a photo of a \u201cgirl next door\u201d type who was standing next to a guy whose whole face was covered in tattoos and piercings. \n\nAgain, this was back in 2021, so the details are a little fuzzy now, but I think the caption said something to the effect of, \u201cWhat would YOU do if your daughter brought THIS guy home?\u201d Most people said things like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my shotgun,\u201d but I thought it would be funnier to say \u201coh thank GOD!\u201d \n\nWell, apparently, as I found out this morning, my daughter saw the comment\u2014and she\u2019s been mad about it ever since. I told her it was a joke, and I asked her why she waited two whole years to bring it up. She didn\u2019t really answer the question, but she said she was so offended by it that she\u2019s probably not coming for Christmas this year. \n\nBut she\u2019s been at our house for the last two Christmases, no problem, and she just came to Thanksgiving a few weeks ago. So I think she\u2019s seriously overreacting here. It was just a dumb joke. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. And it happened such a long time ago. It\u2019s unfair for her to retroactively punish me. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think anybody I knew would ever see the comment, let alone my own daughter. My profile is set to private, so I still don\u2019t know how she saw it. (I asked her if she had hacked into my account, but she just laughed, called me a \u201cBoomer,\u201d and told me I don\u2019t know how Facebook works.)\n\nSo now she wants to ruin Christmas over something that happened two years ago.

I think my traditional, you meant straight. Kids don't go and get married behind their parents back for no reason. Based on the rest of the post, it seems she didn't feel supported by you at all. Homophobia tends to make people feel that way. Saying you wish your daughter was a different sexuality/closeted (which this can def come across that way) is not a joke. It is homophobia - homophobia isn't blatant, spit on queer people, kick them out, call for their deaths hatred. It's also little truth people tell in the words and then call it a joke. It's depicting queer people in a stereotypical way or bad light, calling a queer wedding \"non-traditional\". \nIta really rather obvious that homophobia - especially from a loved one will stick with a gay person for a very long time because it's damaging, dangerous and often ruins their image of the person before. \n\nAlso: setting boundaries by not coming over, when you've hurt her is not a punishment. It's her taking space. It speaks volumes that you're calling it a punishment, as if she's out to hurt you in some wicked way. It doesn't matter whether it happened 2 years ago or a decade ago. It's still her right to distance herself. Admission/accountability go a long way.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did you react to your daughter coming out? Were you supportive of her or were you upset by it? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but judging by the fact that you had to \"come to terms with the fact that she wasn't going to marry a man and have a traditional wedding,\" it seems like initially you weren't supportive of her. Even if it was ten years ago and you've \"come to terms\" with her sexuality, that stuff sticks with you for the rest of your life. Not to mention the amount of homophobia going around today and all the anti-LGBT bills being passed. As a lesbian, it is scary. I'm scared to go out in public and be affectionate with my girlfriend. It may seem like a joke to you, but homophobia isn't funny to your daughter and the rest of the LGBTQ+ community. It's incredibly upsetting and scary to see people making homophobic jokes, especially your own mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI completely understand being up late at night and being loopy from a medication and thinking something is absolutely hilarious. It happens to me all the time.  However, now that you're not sleep deprived, why would saying \"oh thank god\" to the idea of your lesbian daughter, who had a wife of five years at that point, coming home with a man be a joke? Joke or not, that statement gives off the vibes that you don't actually support her sexuality and relationship and that you're just tolerating it. How would you feel if you introduced your partner to your parents and they disapproved of him and wished that you were with someone else? I'm sure you would be upset, or annoyed, or angry. Whether you meant it or not, that's exactly how she feels. She has a right to be upset when her own mother expressed relief at the idea of her being in a relationship with a man instead of a woman. She has a right to be upset that her own mother would joke about something like that. I don't know why she waited two years to bring it up. It's possible that she was trying to push the upset and anger away and be cordial with you during holidays because you're her mom, but she can't keep the negative emotions down anymore. She's not overreacting at all. She feels as if her mother doesn't support her because she's married to a woman, and has felt this way for these past two years. She's been keeping these negative feelings in for that long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologize to your daughter and acknowledge that you made a horrible joke and why it's offensive and upsetting to her.

If not, then she likely still suspects there is regret or resentment there on your side and therefore joking about it is not OK** *(for example, my mom used to joke in family gatherings about when I'm finally gonna have kids... I didn't find it funny and it made me said cause I know that is how she really feels and making a passive agresive joke might have seem harmful but it just made me feel bad )*\n\n**---> Issue number 2- Joking on Social media**\n\nJoking about sensitive topics in the privacy of your home is one thing.. on social media... that is whole other universe. **Even if you had the best relationship with your daughter and everything was rainbows and unicorns, posting a joke about it online, when it can be easily misunderstood, to a community where people might not be supportive or understating is potentially harmful.** Did it occure to you that someone saw that comment, thought you are bitter about your daughters choices and then used it as a jab at her during a random conversation? Your family is supposed to have your back. This was not OK.\n\n\\--> issue number 3 - she didn't say anything about it till now\n\nWell, firstly, she might have not seen it until recently. As I said somebody might have brought it up... even if you facebook profile is private you likely have hundreds of people on there. Or something you have done or said recently might have brought her to rethink her stance on it. **you should not be so hung up on the timeline. it doesn't matter if it was done 2 years ago or yesterday, it hurts now.** \n\nInstead of focusing on whether or not your daugther is overreacting, i would look inward and reflect about your word-choices and behavior.\n\nIf it really and truly was a harmless joke, ask yourself  why  your daughter still doubts your acceptance? Or is it the online thing? In daily interactions how do you talk about it? What words do you choose... do you use passive agressive \"jokes\" in normal communication... and **instead of telling her she is overreacting, acknowledge her feelings and listen and talk to her about** (because deciding which one of you is an Ahole will not help anybody not really, if your ultimate goal is to have a good relationship with her). \n\nLastly, however you look at it, you did something wrong.

It's been out there for people to see for TWO YEARS  (I don't care what your Facebook settings are. You put it on the internet.) The fact that it happened two years ago doesn't make it better. It means you've been doing it for 2 years! That makes it worse! What you intended and what you did are two very different things. Take accountability for what you did.\nInitially, I thought it was just a harmless joke, but then I really started to think about it.  This is a much bigger fuck up than you think it is.", "62 and he knows about social media? \ud83d\ude32", "D: it was just a joke and it was two years ago! I was on Ambien. It's not my fault she saw the comment.\n\nA: why didn't she bring it up earlier? did you hack me? You're the one who \"went behind my back\" and got married!\n\nRVO: my daughter and husband are ganging up on me and running my Christmas", "P]QA,A,A Z A A- !", "Assuming you meant it as only a joke, the joke itself can be funny with the correct audience. Which is clearly not the way it was delivered, so YTA", "Yes, YTA. And you still are by the way you frame that you had to accept that your daughter wouldn\u2019t have a \u201ctraditional wedding\u201d and bla bla bla. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but you COULD choose to love your daughter over tradition. Just a thought.", "YTA. I like dark/offensive jokes, so that was a little funny. But yeah, YTA because you daughter had to elope to marry her wife and you made that joke lol. You should delete that comment, tell your daughter about it, and apologize.", "I think I make these kind of jokes too much and I\u2019m bi.i saw nothing wrong till others pointed it out", "To clarify how Facebook works - people who are your \"friends\" on Facebook can generally see what you post (unless you made a post in a private group). Not only that, Facebook will likely specifically highlight your comment to people in your friend group as part of their feeds (in the same way that your feed likely shows activity from your Facebook group.\n\nIt is likely that many of your Facebook friends saw your comment.", "I think everyone is overreacting.", "I would almost be inclined to side with you that it was a dumb joke that you meant nothing by IF YOU DIDNT GIVE SO MANY DISCLAIMERS. You have a guilty conscience and you should. YTA.", "YTA (obvi) but how fb works is anyone you're friends with can see comments and likes you make on other posts (particularly if that persons post is set to public), it will sometimes pop up on their timeline. The privacy settings is for people youre not friends with. There are ways (or at least there used to be, not sure now) when you make a comment to edit it to a certain privacy.", "YTA. Ambien doesn\u2019t make you homophobic.", "Considering the daughter eloped...I'm going to say a non zero number.", "cringe", "I love it in AITA when someone uses these ambien/it was just a joke/I was tired/I was drunk/I'm not \"fill in the blank\"phobic disclaimers before describing the conflict.\n\nNever seen one where the person was subsequently NTA. If they are making up lame excuses, they kind of know it too.", "I agree with your sentiments in general, but a traditional wedding is absolutely gendered.  That doesn't make it better or ok, but it's silly to pretend that \"traditionally\" weddings weren't opposite sex affairs for the past couple thousand years, in the west anyway.", "Yes, words of a bully.", "My daughter-in-law doesn\u2019t come over for the holidays even though she\u2019s always been invited. My daughter says it\u2019s because she hates the holidays\u2026 but I\u2019m realizing there\u2019s much more to it than that, and I owe both of them an apology.", "1964 is the cutoff year for boomers - but 59 *should* still be young enough that OP should be capable of fathoming how Facebook works.  OTOH it's not clear they know how IRL relationships work either, so understanding that your comments are visible on other peoples' walls or groups might be a big swing here.", "My first thought when I saw the word ambien was wondering if RB had started a seminar on how to deflect and excuse and OP had attended.  I\u2019m sure it has an effect but it doesn\u2019t create any prejudices, seems more like it\u2019s a truth serum cuz the underlying crap sure seems to come out. Or does that make it a mental laxative?", "Drugs or alcohol don't make you say crazy shit you don't believe - they only loosen inhibition about saying what you already think.  To me, it's the Mel Gibson rule - like most people I'm pretty sure I would die of alcohol poisoning before I was drunk enough to accidentally say an antisemitic slur.", "Sorry, just taking it all in.", "I agree. It wasn\u2019t even a mean joke. This thread is insane.", "Exactly. All she said was she didn\u2019t have to worry about a man covered in face tattoos coming home with her daughter.", "Why do we need to understand her perspective for any reason?", "OP really thought we wouldn't call that out ...", "> Who chose to browse facebook while they know they are on a drug that might make them comment stupid things..\n> \n> \n\nPretty much every drunk college student?  \n\nYou people really have some high expectations if you think people don't go on facebook impaired on a regular basis.", "The eloping unexpectedly without her being invited part is what the OP says she objected to. That is not something that only queer people do.", "The daughter probably only saw it now because Facebook memories and Timehop periodically pull things out from the past. And Facebook comments are public, so OP demanding to know how her daughter saw it and asking whether she \u201chacked into her account\u201d (lol) is idiotic and demonstrates a lack of understanding of how social media works. Also, the joke literally does not work unless the person who sees it 1) knows OP\u2019s daughter is gay and 2) thinks that\u2019s a bad thing. Therefore, it\u2019s an unfunny and homophobic joke with a very limited target audience. Comparing it to comedy shows and movies is disingenuous.\n\nAnd I have a strong hunch that the daughter is upset about it now because OP *hasn\u2019t* changed her attitude much in the past 2 years. The way she speaks about her daughter\u2019s marriage in the post is very very clear. If OP really had changed her views, she\u2019d be apologizing to her daughter and having an honest conversation about it, not going on the warpath about \u201csome time has passed, therefore you are not allowed to be mad\u201d.", "yah.... i was tryna be compassionate to her. :)", "Good on you for acknowledging that you made a mistake and need to apologize; people never stop growing\n\nThat said, if your DIL hasn't ever spent the holidays with you and they eloped without telling you... I think you need to seriously and honestly reflect on other comments and \"jokes\" you've made over the years. I would posit that, from the very little context I have, the Facebook comment is not the only thing you have to apologize for \n\nSelf reflection is always hard and this is a big one so you have to be very honest with yourself before you can be honest with others. Good luck OP", "please change your behaviour immediately if you want to have contact with your daughter long term\u2026 my situation is very similar to your daughter\u2019s, my parents are just like you. they are also not saying obvious homophobic things or that they don\u2019t like my fiance, but everything they say is still screaming disappointment and homophobia they just think it\u2019s funny or don\u2018t even realise it. my fiance is also invited always but we have so much pain because of my family and all the ways they hurt me, us, and the fact i have to also leave her home alone for christmas!!!! please just imagine a happy loving relationship and it\u2019s easier to go through christmas alone(!!!!) for her than dealing with my parents, and in your case, you. your daughter in law spends christmas separately from her loving wife because of you. let that sink in\u2026 i can tell you that those days are just survival mode painful days because of you and honestly after some time we realise it\u2019s not worth it at all\u2026\n\nedit: we also plan on eloping for the same reasons \ud83d\ude43", "Daughter-in-law is smart and doesn't want to waste time on homophobes. Have fun being alone this year.", "If the comment was made on public post, it's public for _everyone_, no matter what privacy settings you're using on your own profile...", "I hope you can do enough soul-searching to salvage your relationship with your daughter.", "Maybe so, I would, however, point out that this was acceptable to my mate. Which given he was the one involved means that it was acceptable and, therefore, a pass. Which is my point. Jokes do not necessarily reflect a person's viewpoints contrary to your point of view.", "You don't.", "Tbh, OP comes across a lot like my own parents.  They'll never admit they did anything wrong.  They always have an excuse for why something wasn't their fault or was really someone else's fault.  Or they'll even rewrite history in their mind so it happened a different way.  They're very narcissistic. Everything is about them and how it impacts them.  \n\nEvery single part of OPs post is about denying or deflecting about what happened.  Having the parents I do, it is easy to see why they would bring up the elopement.  In their mind, the reasons for it and what they did don't matter.  Tha daughter could explain in detail and OP would just ignore it and say something like \"but you made me upset\" (with my mother it is all about her so called anxiety...but we do not have the time to get into all her bullshit and it is off topic).  The only thing that matters is that they were sad they didn't get to go to a wedding, so that means their daughter is bad.  So people, in their mind, should feel bad for them and think their daughter is a bad person.    They do not care about other people.  Even if they can pretend very well at times.  That is how their minds work.  If you meet someone like this, run the fuck away.  Though they can be hard to spot.  Like I said, some are good at pretending.  My parents sure are with the outside world.\n\nLook up the missing reasons.  Very applicable here.  I'd not be shocked if this is a first step to cutting off OP.  The daughter will be much better for it if I've analyzed it correctly.  I'm working to this myself.  Saving money and trying to get out.  I know I'll be healthier.", "They're not saying people don't do it. Obviously they do, but that doesn't make being on Ambien an excuse for posting shitty things. It's not some kind of get out of jail free card, at most it's an explanation, but it doesn't make it any better. \n\nIf you make the choice to browse social media while on mind altering substances, and then you post something shitty about someone you care about, that post is still your fault and your responsibility to own up for. You can't just brush it away with \"but I was on Ambien so I'm not actually to blame here!\"", "I'd posit that it is they who have the high expectations, thinking that they ought to incur no consequences for their words because they spewed them irresponsibly.", "I never said it was?  All I said was that a traditional wedding is two opposite sex people, because that's what weddings have been in the west for centuries and that's what \"traditional\" means.  Traditional doesn't mean \"what our current morals are ok with\".  I never said only traditional weddings are good.  I never said gay people shouldn't be able to get married.  I never said anything supporting the OP.  I personally think tradition sucks and is just bullying by dead people.  But it's still tradition.", "I think it might be that mom would be relieved she was dating someone coded as a dirtbag rather than be married to her daughter-in-law (who is likely a perfectly nice enough person).\n\nSo. Yeah. Homophobia.", "Yeah the past few days I\u2019ve started to come to the conclusion you\u2019re average Redditor isn\u2019t too good at that", "Then why open your comment like that? You essentially dismissed those of us who are younger just for our age. And then you agreed with us.", "My parents too. Cut me to the core and then play the victim when there are consequences for it.  Distance, physical and emotional, is the best thing you can do for yourself.", "It absolutely is because they are choosing not to make the effort.  Some people change when it is someone close to them, but some don't or just pretend.  These people may even think themselves accepting and tolerant because they think of prejudice as being outwardly hateful or discriminatory behaviour towards the group.  But they aren't.  The bar isn't - did I shout slurs at someone in the street.\n\nI have parents like this and they just don't get it.  They don't get why my sibling was afraid to come out to them.  It's because of every single thing they said over the years about LGBT+ people.  So what they didn't use slurs.  Now, my sibling is the favourite, so they at least pretend to accept them.  For me...no chance.  I'm asexual and I know from past comments and behaviour  exactly the bullshit I'd get.  My parents have never cared for me, so I can't count on favoured status to overcome their prejudice.  So I just quietly don't date and make excuses and wait to move out.  I know my parents haven't really changed at all.", "Exactly.. or every drunk driver would be free to go..\n\n\"Sorry officer, I'm drunk so it's not my fault this school bus of children is now drowning in the river..\"", "I never said she wasn't responsible, just that it's a bit ridiculous to think it's normal for people to avoid social media when on mind altering substances.  It's not some universal rule everyone knows and follows.", "The \"traditional\" wedding that OP is referring to is an American wedding, which is not that old and can certainly be done with two women. (And is done by lesbians! Frequently!)\n\nAll the same events -- dresses/tuxes, her being the mother of the bride, walk down the aisle, flowers, ring bearers, attendants, reception toast, dance with the parents -- ALL of those can be  and is frequently down by lesbian couples.\n\nThat's the traditional wedding that's being discussed.\n\nOP would have \"lost\" none of that by the fact that her daughter's partner is a woman not a man.\n\nOf course, she did lose all that because she's homophobic.", "I'm not accusing you of bigotry. What I'm saying is that \"traditional\" in the context that the OP uses it, contrasted to an elopement, has nothing to do with the genders of the people getting married. It's clear that the OP is bigoted, so maybe the meaning you're getting at is implied too, even if not intentionally. But in the sense that OP is using it, two people of the same gender can absolutely have a \"traditional\" wedding.", "Your definition completely leaves out a fundamental requirement of any joke: it should be funny", "I am the ParaprosDovahkiin.", "I know.", "I mean, it could go the way you're describing, or it could go in the opposite direction. OP apparently has trouble keeping her thoughts inside when she's under the influence. She could just as easily have a few too many drinks and make similar passing comments, and not everyone wants to deal with that kind of energy on their wedding day.\n\nEven if it is \"just a joke,\" there's obviously a deeper sentiment underlying it. There's a clear premise that OP views her daughter's relationship as being less desirable than a straight one; the joke makes no sense if you don't go in with that assumption. I agree that the joke doesn't convey Westbourough baptist church levels of contempt for gay people, but it's not really the goofy, tone-deaf boomer joke that you're describing either, in my opinion.", "I completely feel you. We are in very similar situations. Homophobia  is way more and way deeper than just outward obvious hate like shouting slurs. We feel it and know it the most...", "OP didn't really contrast the \"traditional wedding\" with elopement though. She said that because her daughter had come out years earlier, she had come to terms with the fact that she wouldn't have a \"traditional wedding\" and was then later upset when the daughter decided to elope. \n\nSounds like OP would have very much deemed any same sex wedding to be \"untraditional\" - which, from a historical standpoint - sure, I guess.", "fair point\n\nit's especially not funny because the only people who would 'get' the joke are those who know OP and understand the context", "Yes but who says there can be only one AH per situation? Your daughter is an AH too. Like mother like daughter. Your husband maybe would like a peaceful holiday and that\u2019s hard to do with the two of you together.", "The daughter's an asshole for wanting herself, her wife and their marriage to be treated with some respect by her mother?"]}
