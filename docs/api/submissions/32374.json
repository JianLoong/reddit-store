Facebook is still the only social media I use. But my husband (62M) suggested that I should create an account here and ask Reddit if I\u2019m the AH. \n\nSo here goes.\n\nMy daughter and her wife (36F) eloped in 2016. She came out to me 10 years before that, so I\u2019d already come to terms with the fact that she wasn\u2019t going to marry a man and have a traditional wedding. But I was really upset when she went behind my back and got married without telling me. \n\nAnyway, fast-forward to two years ago. I was up late and loopy from my Ambien. I was scrolling through Facebook and commented on a photo of a \u201cgirl next door\u201d type who was standing next to a guy whose whole face was covered in tattoos and piercings. \n\nAgain, this was back in 2021, so the details are a little fuzzy now, but I think the caption said something to the effect of, \u201cWhat would YOU do if your daughter brought THIS guy home?\u201d Most people said things like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my shotgun,\u201d but I thought it would be funnier to say \u201coh thank GOD!\u201d \n\nWell, apparently, as I found out this morning, my daughter saw the comment\u2014and she\u2019s been mad about it ever since. I told her it was a joke, and I asked her why she waited two whole years to bring it up. She didn\u2019t really answer the question, but she said she was so offended by it that she\u2019s probably not coming for Christmas this year. \n\nBut she\u2019s been at our house for the last two Christmases, no problem, and she just came to Thanksgiving a few weeks ago. So I think she\u2019s seriously overreacting here. It was just a dumb joke. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. And it happened such a long time ago. It\u2019s unfair for her to retroactively punish me. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think anybody I knew would ever see the comment, let alone my own daughter. My profile is set to private, so I still don\u2019t know how she saw it. (I asked her if she had hacked into my account, but she just laughed, called me a \u201cBoomer,\u201d and told me I don\u2019t know how Facebook works.)\n\nSo now she wants to ruin Christmas over something that happened two years ago. And my husband already told my daughter (his stepdaughter) that it\u2019s perfectly fine if she wants to skip Christmas this year.

Admit full responsibility for the hurtful comment you made. Apologize to everyone and (hopefully honestly) say that your attitudes about same-sex relationships and \"traditions\" have matured since then. \n2. Recognize that your daughter is an adult and she didn't \"go behind your back\" to get married. You were not entitled to advance notice or any say in the matter whatsoever. This entitled attitude you are still demonstrating has got to go. \n\nYour daughter is not overreacting. She also gets to decide where and with whom she wants to spend Christmas.

They're right to be mad at you. You need to delete the comment, apologize, and start showing support. In time, if you do it right, she'll return to you.

At worst, it shows you really dislike and disapprove of her being gay. And I would bet there\u2019s a lot more behind that and her decision to elope and note invite you to the wedding. There\u2019s some clear issues there that this stoked and provoked\u2026", "YTA. Your daughter eloped behind your back. How is that not getting through to you? That speaks volumes to me. She didn't feel comfortable having her mother at her wedding. It's obvious she's dealt with years of homophobia. It's also pretty likely you make your daughter in law extremely uncomfortable. Apologize and do everything you can to mend your relationship before it gets worse or before it's too late.", "So when she comes over for holidays, does she bring her wife?

If you apologized for upsetting her and she's still reacting this way, that's just bizarre, especially as you've apparently interacted with her since she saw this before and it doesn't sound like she was upset then.\n\nSo what else happened?  Did this lead to an argument in which she felt like you weren't respecting how she felt?  Or is this something else that's coming to the surface in the form of some old grievance because it's easier than bring up what's really wrong?\n\nI don't know, but it would be a good time to take extra care about showing empathy and openness to accept her feelings and talk openly.", "NTA. Something else is going on. Something bigger. She's just using that as an excuse. Let her skip it. Tell her if something is going on she can tell you to not be afraid that you're there for her. Because I suspect something happened that she's avoiding telling you and is avoiding you as much as possible.", "NTA\n\nYou had a child with your husband thinking you were getting one thing but ended up getting another. I don't blame you for being salty for your daughter's sexuality. Imagine a parent discovering their child never grew out of their sexual appetite for kids. We'd all be understandably frustrated and disheartened.\n\nI do think invoking God by using His name in a sarcastic manner is blasphemy, so that diminishes my view of you a bit.\n\nHowever your daughter called you a slur, and laughed about it when she said \"boomer\". Your daughter is ageist. She doesn't deserver someone as kind and wonderful as a mother like you. \n\nI recommend distancing yourself from the hedonistic lifestyle of your child and suggest bringing another life into this world. Maybe they will turn out normal and you can enjoy all the splendid life events you anticipated for your daughter. \n\nTake care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
