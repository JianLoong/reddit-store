Facebook is still the only social media I use. But my husband (62M) suggested that I should create an account here and ask Reddit if I\u2019m the AH. \n\nSo here goes.\n\nMy daughter and her wife (36F) eloped in 2016. She came out to me 10 years before that, so I\u2019d already come to terms with the fact that she wasn\u2019t going to marry a man and have a traditional wedding. But I was really upset when she went behind my back and got married without telling me. \n\nAnyway, fast-forward to two years ago. I was up late and loopy from my Ambien. I was scrolling through Facebook and commented on a photo of a \u201cgirl next door\u201d type who was standing next to a guy whose whole face was covered in tattoos and piercings. \n\nAgain, this was back in 2021, so the details are a little fuzzy now, but I think the caption said something to the effect of, \u201cWhat would YOU do if your daughter brought THIS guy home?\u201d Most people said things like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my shotgun,\u201d but I thought it would be funnier to say \u201coh thank GOD!\u201d \n\nWell, apparently, as I found out this morning, my daughter saw the comment\u2014and she\u2019s been mad about it ever since. I told her it was a joke, and I asked her why she waited two whole years to bring it up. She didn\u2019t really answer the question, but she said she was so offended by it that she\u2019s probably not coming for Christmas this year. \n\nBut she\u2019s been at our house for the last two Christmases, no problem, and she just came to Thanksgiving a few weeks ago. So I think she\u2019s seriously overreacting here. It was just a dumb joke. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. And it happened such a long time ago. It\u2019s unfair for her to retroactively punish me. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think anybody I knew would ever see the comment, let alone my own daughter. My profile is set to private, so I still don\u2019t know how she saw it. (I asked her if she had hacked into my account, but she just laughed, called me a \u201cBoomer,\u201d and told me I don\u2019t know how Facebook works.)\n\nSo now she wants to ruin Christmas over something that happened two years ago. And my husband already told my daughter (his stepdaughter) that it\u2019s perfectly fine if she wants to skip Christmas this year.

I think my traditional, you meant straight. Kids don't go and get married behind their parents back for no reason. Based on the rest of the post, it seems she didn't feel supported by you at all. Homophobia tends to make people feel that way. Saying you wish your daughter was a different sexuality/closeted (which this can def come across that way) is not a joke. It is homophobia - homophobia isn't blatant, spit on queer people, kick them out, call for their deaths hatred. It's also little truth people tell in the words and then call it a joke. It's depicting queer people in a stereotypical way or bad light, calling a queer wedding \"non-traditional\". \nIta really rather obvious that homophobia - especially from a loved one will stick with a gay person for a very long time because it's damaging, dangerous and often ruins their image of the person before. \n\nAlso: setting boundaries by not coming over, when you've hurt her is not a punishment. It's her taking space. It speaks volumes that you're calling it a punishment, as if she's out to hurt you in some wicked way. It doesn't matter whether it happened 2 years ago or a decade ago. It's still her right to distance herself. Admission/accountability go a long way.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did you react to your daughter coming out? Were you supportive of her or were you upset by it? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but judging by the fact that you had to \"come to terms with the fact that she wasn't going to marry a man and have a traditional wedding,\" it seems like initially you weren't supportive of her. Even if it was ten years ago and you've \"come to terms\" with her sexuality, that stuff sticks with you for the rest of your life. Not to mention the amount of homophobia going around today and all the anti-LGBT bills being passed. As a lesbian, it is scary. I'm scared to go out in public and be affectionate with my girlfriend. It may seem like a joke to you, but homophobia isn't funny to your daughter and the rest of the LGBTQ+ community. It's incredibly upsetting and scary to see people making homophobic jokes, especially your own mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI completely understand being up late at night and being loopy from a medication and thinking something is absolutely hilarious. It happens to me all the time.  However, now that you're not sleep deprived, why would saying \"oh thank god\" to the idea of your lesbian daughter, who had a wife of five years at that point, coming home with a man be a joke? Joke or not, that statement gives off the vibes that you don't actually support her sexuality and relationship and that you're just tolerating it. How would you feel if you introduced your partner to your parents and they disapproved of him and wished that you were with someone else? I'm sure you would be upset, or annoyed, or angry. Whether you meant it or not, that's exactly how she feels. She has a right to be upset when her own mother expressed relief at the idea of her being in a relationship with a man instead of a woman. She has a right to be upset that her own mother would joke about something like that. I don't know why she waited two years to bring it up. It's possible that she was trying to push the upset and anger away and be cordial with you during holidays because you're her mom, but she can't keep the negative emotions down anymore. She's not overreacting at all. She feels as if her mother doesn't support her because she's married to a woman, and has felt this way for these past two years. She's been keeping these negative feelings in for that long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologize to your daughter and acknowledge that you made a horrible joke and why it's offensive and upsetting to her. Show her that you support her and her relationship. I don't know your daughter or if she's one to hold grudges, so I can't say that doing these will make her change her mind and come over for Christmas, but apologizing and actively supporting her and the rest of the community will go a long way and help repair the relationship between the two of you.", "Oh man, this one is nice to unpack.
