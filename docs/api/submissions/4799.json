You do what you need to keep yourself healthy, safe and in a good headspace. They clearly haven't dealt with anything difficult like that.", "NTA,\nYou did the right thing and so did your coach. \nI\u2019m also concerned about the girls in your teams lack of understanding regarding eating disorders. What sport is this ?", "NTA not in a million years. you weren't trying to censor anything, you asked them to be considerate of your own struggles and when they refused you took yourself out of this harmful situation. good on you for standing up for yourself, keep doing that please", "NTA.  You got yourself out of a situation that could've caused a downward spiral for you.  Good for you on recognizing it.  Anyone commenting on you being a \"snowflake\" is being ignorant.  They'll never understand what you've had to overcome.", "NTA- people do not understand triggers for some reason, you left the situation and as a person that is a long time out of an ed recovery i can promise you it gets easier and you can also enforce your boundaries by removing yourself from situations guilt free eventually. it sucks having to leave situations due to peoples lack of understanding on the severity of the situation but you have to look after yourself.", "NTA anyone that says otherwise has either never had a trauma effect them or wants to see everyone burn.\n\nEdit to say: OP get a good pair of headphones. People are cruel and it is possible if the people you were rooming with are popular that a lot of people will go out of their way to try and trigger you as some twisted revenge", "NTA.\n\n>But I had to share a room with them, so I asked them to cut it out (and very explicitly told them why).\n\nThis should've been the end of the discussion. You brought up a boundary that you wanted respected and they decided to ignore it and be AHs about it. They're not your friends if they pull things like that, deliberately making you feel uncomfortable. Good for you for standing your ground and for getting yourself through the worst of your ED, that's a very difficult thing to do. Wishing you the best of luck for the future!", "Nta. You asked, they said no. You asked to be separated instead of being near them. Problem solved. They, however, need to learn a little empathy.", "NTA your mental and physical health cones first, you did everything right.", "NTA. You have a good understanding of your mental health and what you need to continue healing. It is possible these two have never had to deal with or face mental health and physical health struggles so it was easy to brush off discussions as being triggering as they don\u2019t know what that is. You did what you needed to do. The chaperone could have moved you with ir without chewing them out so that isn\u2019t on you. Perhaps they have a better understanding now", "NTA. You need to work with professional therapists that specialize in EDs. It is not everyone else\u2019s responsibility to worry about your recovery, but it IS your right to take yourself out of situations that can be toxic to you. You spoke up about your needs, and you\u2019re allowed to do that. Everyone else can go kick rocks.", "NTA. Never an asshole for taking care of your mental and physical well-being.", "NTA\nyou made a choice that would help you", "NTA.  Their behavior was disgusting.  I've seen what ED's can do.  They deserved to be chewed out.  Snowflake is an insult used by giant A's trying to justify bad behavior.", "NTA. That was a perfectly reasonable request and there isn't a single thing about it that justifies calling you a snowflake. You weren't trying to censor anything, you gave context to your very real and valid physical and mental health issues and asked for a bare minimum amount of respect and then when they refused and escalated you did the only thing you can control which is removing yourself from the situation. This is setting and maintaining healthy boundaries and is super important to your wellbeing. Keep it up and don't let anyone shame you or belittle you for taking care of yourself. (Edited for typo.)", "Definitely NTA.\n\nWell done for setting boundaries and advocating for yourself in helpful and constructive ways. It takes a lot of courage to do so at any age, but it's even more challenging in a high school/teenage environment where surviving peer pressure, cliques, social dynamics, etc. is particularly challenging.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the majority of people have a disordered relationship with food, exercise and physical appearance to the point where it's so ubiquitous and insidious that many are comfortable to leave it remain unremarked upon. You did a great thing. Wishing you the very best on your recovery journey.", "NTA. You did what you needed to do to stay healthy and not relapse. We are all proud of you for taking such a difficult step. We know it\u2019s hard at that age with all the opinionated teenage egos, but you did it. They\u2019re the assholes.", "NTA. Diet culture is so normalized it\u2019s ridiculous. Good for you for enforcing your boundaries and prioritizing your recovery!", "NTA at all, a lot of people don't understand the severity of eating disorders and how hard recovery is. Good on you for getting away from the situation, and good luck on the rest of your recovery journey \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA in the slightest, my younger sisters struggled for years with an ED and I understand how triggering dieting/calories talk can be when you're in recovery.\n\nETA: I can't read, there was a coach involved.", "NTA at all. You took the appropriate steps to ensure your mental health and safety. I\u2019m glad your coach helped too. These girls are bullies and it\u2019s time they got called out for it.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYou were protecting yourself and your health and that should always take priority. You gave them a chance to shut it down for good reasoning, and the fact they continued despite knowing your history was an AH move. \n\nThe fact that your team thinks you\u2019re the \u2018snowflake\u2019 for protecting yourself is alarming and has so many red flags. Where is the empathy for others in this day and age? What a bunch of AH. \n\nI\u2019m proud of you for stepping up for yourself and doing what YOU needed to do for YOU! I wish you all the best, don\u2019t let them get to you because they\u2019re not worth it. Never stop fighting and prioritizing your well-being. \ud83d\udc99", "NTA \nim tired of people with dangerous or unhealthy opinions getting mad that other people don't want to hear it and cry about censorship, especially when it comes from comedians or famous people no one is censoring them they can spew whatever they want the reality of it is that people don't have to listen, they are choosing to stop being fans and stop listening because they realize \"oh shit this person is crazy/radical/dangerous/misinformed and is spreading it and I dont wanna support that\" \n\nthere are times and places for certain conversations, not all topics are for everyone. You wouldn't discuss murder docs with a 6 year old, you wouldn't talk about drug use with recovering addicts, you SHOULDNT talk about diets and how to lose weight with someone who had an eating disorder. They aren't censored they are talking about an inappropriate topic in a school setting with someone who has a traumatizing history with the subject, they can still have their conversation just not with you.\n\nCensorship is the suppression of POLITICAL stances that are considered unacceptable or threats to security, it is not your teacher stopping an inappropriate conversation due to its insensitive nature during a school trip.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't go out of your way to raise to make others uncomfortable. \n\nIt wouldn't be acceptable in adult social circles to target someone with a history, who specified it and asked to stop for that reason, and then escalate it further. \n\nThese aren't friends, these are just people you spend time with at school, coz friends wouldn't do this.", "That seems very convenient\u2026."]}
