I (F36) am really happy for them both.\n\nMy sister and I are very different people. I will admit that I am very type A, and my sister is much more laid back. I will also admit that as someone who really likes plans, watching my sister plan her wedding has stressed me out, especially because I am with her a lot. Neither her or her partner have really had strong opinions regarding anything in the planning process.\n\nSome examples: -Someone in the bridal party group chat finally asked what they would be wearing a couple months back. Her response? \"IDC just don't let your genitals show.\"\n\n-Her future mother in law showed up wanting to show us the dress she got for the wedding. It was a floor length white gown. My sister's comment? \"Oh that's cool. I like that.\"\n\n-Catering? She got annoyed with all the choices so her and Jason said fuck it and are now ordering pizza for their wedding.\n\nObviously this is all okay but I guess my point is they just haven't really seemed to care much about what their wedding is going to be like.\n\nLast week I asked if my two girls (4,6) could be flower girls. She said \"No we're having the dogs do that.\" I was a little stunned that she didn't want her only nieces to take part in the wedding. So I asked if they could be given some other task for the wedding because they were really looking forward to it. That's when she told me her and Jason don't want kids at the wedding at all. I was really taken back. I asked why and she says that just wasn't the vibe they were going for. I reminded her that her \"vibe\" was currently pizza being served at someone's house with her four dogs running down the aisle. She laughed and said that was the decision they had made. I was obviously upset and told her that it was really selfish to not include her nieces and they were going to be heartbroken. She just shrugged and said it was my fault for telling them they were going to be there.\n\nI left in tears and called our mom. To my surprise, she said that it was my sister's wedding and she could do what she wanted. I said that I was just upset that she didn't seem to care about anything else but the one firm decision she made was that my children couldn't be there. My mom said I was being an ass and to just get a babysitter for one night.", "created_utc": 1688992749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vswbw/aita_for_pushing_back_against_my_sister_having_a/", "score": 346, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love a small registery office / courthouse ceremony and I think children should be welcome there especially if it's their parents getting married. However the more 'traditional' weddings which is normally a whole day of celebrating its not fair on children and I actually don't think they belong around usually drunk adults. Weddings are boring and often tense and I don't think children really enjoy themselves.", "YTA I will admit your sister\u2019s idea of wedding is very close to what I had. Minus pizza cause I love good food. \nIt\u2019s her day let her have what she wants. Childless weddings are becoming the norm and are a hit or a miss.

It also doesn't mean she loves you any less. It sounds like she likes spending time with you, and she is good at explaining her baundaries and keeping herself at piece. \n\nI get that you love seeing your sister be crazy about your kids, that that feels like love to you. But she didn't reject you or your kids, as this day is not about that, it's about her and her fiance, and she wants you and the rest of the familly there to celebracte ot with. \n\nIt can also be that she actually likes you to focus on her that day, and spend the other days focussing on your kids. I would recommend doing some introspection as to why you feel so rejected by this. Non-judgemental introspection. Cause it's okay to feel strong emotions, even ones that don't make sense to others. It's just important to not project these emotions onto others. Best of luck :)", "YTA. Her wedding, her choice.\n\nAlso, running to mummy about it like an 8 yo whose sister won't give you her toy?

Letting her bridesmaids pick their own dresses or choosing to serve pizza seem like very firm decisions to me. \n\nThis is their wedding, and you have to respect that.

It sounds to me like she\u2019s going for a no fuss adult party vibe. People can wear what they want. They can eat pizza. And they can drink a lot because no kids. Assuming they would be invited and pushing for them to be included was an AH move. If you\u2019ve made the mistake of hyping the event up to your kids, see if you can convince your sister to attend a celebration brunch with your kids (on your dime, because you\u2019re fixing your mistake).

I know it's hard to believe for some people with children, but the ear-piercing screech of children isn't a good time for a lot of us. But I don't even see that as the biggest problem here.

I (F36) am really happy for them both.\n\nMy sister and I are very different people. I will admit that I am very type A, and my sister is much more laid back. I will also admit that as someone who really likes plans, watching my sister plan her wedding has stressed me out, especially because I am with her a lot. Neither her or her partner have really had strong opinions regarding anything in the planning process.\n\nSome examples: -Someone in the bridal party group chat finally asked what they would be wearing a couple months back. Her response? \"IDC just don't let your genitals show.\"\n\n-Her future mother in law showed up wanting to show us the dress she got for the wedding. It was a floor length white gown. My sister's comment? \"Oh that's cool. I like that.\"\n\n-Catering? She got annoyed with all the choices so her and Jason said fuck it and are now ordering pizza for their wedding.\n\nObviously this is all okay but I guess my point is they just haven't really seemed to care much about what their wedding is going to be like.\n\nLast week I asked if my two girls (4,6) could be flower girls. She said \"No we're having the dogs do that.\" I was a little stunned that she didn't want her only nieces to take part in the wedding. So I asked if they could be given some other task for the wedding because they were really looking forward to it. That's when she told me her and Jason don't want kids at the wedding at all. I was really taken back. I asked why and she says that just wasn't the vibe they were going for. I reminded her that her \"vibe\" was currently pizza being served at someone's house with her four dogs running down the aisle. She laughed and said that was the decision they had made. I was obviously upset and told her that it was really selfish to not include her nieces and they were going to be heartbroken. She just shrugged and said it was my fault for telling them they were going to be there.\n\nI left in tears and called our mom. To my surprise, she said that it was my sister's wedding and she could do what she wanted. I said that I was just upset that she didn't seem to care about anything else but the one firm decision she made was that my children couldn't be there. My mom said I was being an ass and to just get a babysitter for one night.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
