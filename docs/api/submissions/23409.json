We didn\u2019t had a lot of interactions and they broke up. He never told me exactly why\n\nWell, turns out he got her pregnant and when she told him, he simply said he didn\u2019t wanted nothing to do with her or the baby. She gave birth to L(15M), no one in my family knew about it since they never spoke again \n\nThe information that i got from his social worker isn\u2019t a lot, but this is everything I managed to gather: L and his mother lived together for two years before he was taken away from her due to neglect. Since then, L went from foster home to foster home. All I can say is that the system wasn\u2019t nice on him and he endured a lot in it. He has partial hearing loss, apparently has PTSD and behavioral issues due to his surroundings\n\nIm not sure how they got the information that we are his bio family, probably his bio mother finally told on T. I don\u2019t know if Im angrier about him never telling us that he got another girl pregnant or that he simply send her away\n\nAnyways, his social worker talked to my brother and asked him to take L in. T asked for a DNA test and its 100% his child. L was introduced to my family and, honestly, L is a lovely kid. Everyone thought he would be difficult to deal with, but he\u2019s just a kid who desperately needs a family and somewhere safe away everything he endured\n\nBut, T said that he was not going to take L in. He explained that he has another family now. To say i was angry is an understatement. I just can\u2019t understand how dare him, knowing everything he went through and knowing that if he says no, L will be forced back into this system that failed him countless times, to reject him\n\nI fought a lot with my brother, but he wouldn\u2019t budge, saying that he can\u2019t bring an unknown child with mental problems to his house that he has small children in\n\nSo yesterday, I reached out to his social worker and asked her if I could be the one to foster L. I explained to her my brothers motives (about the small children) and told her that I wouldn\u2019t have that problem since my children are older than L and it would be better for L to get used to his family that way. They liked the idea and started to look into it, and my brother was notified of that\n\nWe got in a new argument. He said that I have no right to do what I am doing, that L is not real family. I said that he is rejecting his rights as a father to L, so he couldn\u2019t tell me what to do with his child\n\nMy brother got involved. He scolded T, but said I over stepped when I asked to foster him, since he\u2019s still Ts child and it was obvious that he doesn\u2019t wants L around\n\nIm not changing my mind if im actually the asshole, i wont let L into this system again, but I want to if AITA", "created_utc": 1690640584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ctjxs/aita_for_fostering_my_nephew_against_my_brothers/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is trying to pretend this poor child never happened, and by having him around in the family he can't pretend.  Give that baby a good life!  NTA", "NTA! You're doing a great thing for that kid and you should feel proud of that. As for T he's probably just upset because either his wife doesn't know and he doesn't want her to find out, she knows but it causes tension because T probably lied for years about not having kids, or T is just that big of an A that he genuinely doesn't think anyone in his family should have anything to do with L because he already rejected him several times.\n\nThing is it's not T's choice, he had several chances to step up and be a father, but chose not to. You want to get to know your nephew and help him, there is nothing wrong with that. T is the one with the issues.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA your brother has disowned him so therefore he classes as an orphaned child (aware he has a mother, but she is out if the picture) You as a kind hearted human being are taking in this child. \n\nI guess you will never know what happened between the Mom and your brother, but for him to disown a child due to their mental status isn't right. It sounds like the rest of your family is also happy to disown him due to the mental issues which doesn't sound great either. They are being TA for not putting themselves in your shoes and seeing it from your point of view", "NTA - providing a child a loving home is one of the greatest things an adult can do. Kudos to you for volunteering to be this kid\u2019s hero.", "NTA for deciding to take care of the child, but don't expect L to ever be accepted by your brother or his wife and kids. You may just have accept some distance between you and him for a while.", "I think you\u2019re about to make a new family OP. Full of the good people and away from the crappy ones", "No judgement. I understand both of you. You want to help a kid and he doesn't want someone potentially harmful around his children.", "NTA, you are being the bigger person, and willing to take on a lot, this is what you do for family. Your brother wants to play, but does not want to pay, maybe he is embarrassed, but it is out now and hopefully the rest of the family takes him in and shows him what family can do for somoneone.", "ESH.  The 37 year old brother made some unfortunate choices when he was still (just a kid, basically)  But the variable missing is why he ghosted the mother of his child, as well as the child.  We might think that is extreme and un-necessary (or even irresponsible).  But sadly, it's possible to have a toxic girlfriend and get her prego before you realize that it's better not to have her in your life.  The fact that mother lost the child due to NEGLECT gives us some insight that (most likely) the mother would have been a severely toxic influence on anyone she was involved with.  Seeing that the father is 37 and STILL wants nothing to do with her, we must assume that the 37  year old honestly believes that he's better off without his EX having any contact with him or his family.\n\nBoil it down?  Best evidence suggests that it's a \"good  idea\" for 37M brother  to insist on no contact with his ex gf for both himself and his family.\n\nBut that doesn't mean your brother is totally innocent.  He should have been (at least) on the hook for child support, obviously.  So I judge him to be an AH if he hasn't at least been contributing financially to support his child.\n\nBut OP is an asshole for dragging the kid into close contact with the family, against the wishes of the 37M brother who is the bio dad of the kid.  See, you can't just foster the child.  It's a package deal.  You bring the kid into the family, and you are also bringing the MOM into the family.   37M brother is upset, as he doesn't want the toxic ex gf to bring her toxicity back to him, or any of his family.  But OP is using kid as an anchor to allow the toxic ex gf to get her hooks into the whole family now.  Yes, that is truly an AH move, for OP to do that to the younger brother and his family.\n\nI can understand the concern for a kid who  you have learned is your biological nephew.  But in this circumstance, there is no way forward that doesn't suck.  There are just degrees of suck.  Like, this situation sucks, but doing this will suck a bit less...\n\nBest outcome for all would be for the kid to be adopted in a closed adoption by a loving family that has no (zero) genetic relation.\n\n2nd best outcome would be foster with a family that is not related to OP.  But if OP still wants to help, OP could offer to support the kid financially, which is (unfortunately) more than the bio dad did.\n\n3rd best outcome would be for OP to foster the kid.  It would be great for the kid, obviously.  But don't be surprised if this causes a permanent rift between yourself and your brother.  He might ghost you and other family members.  Is it worth it to insert yourself into your nephew's life?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur brother is the AH.", "Nta. Your brother is for not wanting you to foster the kiddo. However I\u2019m going to say at the same time his logic for not wanting to take the child in is kinda sound. Taking in a child who has lived in the foster system and has been through a lot of damaging situations is a wild card and I get why your brother wouldn\u2019t want to expose his young kids to that. But him throwing away his kiddo is a huge issue. With that said. A child needs a loving and stable home. If you think you can provide it for her and you want to\u2026go for it!

I'm sorry he has to see what an ass his sermon donor is.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a loser and honestly it sounds like you are better off without him in your life.

Your other brother sucks as well. Save that kid and don't look back, and frankly, lord it over your two brothers as much as you can.

Just because your brother doesn't want his son, that doesn't mean his family doesn't want him. Take the kid and help him through the trauma of being in the system. Tell your brother that you have made the decision and if he doesn't like it, he needn't come around.", "I really misunderstood the title; I thought you were sending him back into foster care!

He had his change to care for his child and he chose not to ( I do understand his concerns but not him telling you you cannot do this, he did not step up, you did )\n\nThis however would mean for interesting situations and questions with family visits ( i assume this situation means you will go LC or NC with at least one brother ) \n\nI dont know if your parents are around.
