We didn\u2019t had a lot of interactions and they broke up. He never told me exactly why\n\nWell, turns out he got her pregnant and when she told him, he simply said he didn\u2019t wanted nothing to do with her or the baby. She gave birth to L(15M), no one in my family knew about it since they never spoke again \n\nThe information that i got from his social worker isn\u2019t a lot, but this is everything I managed to gather: L and his mother lived together for two years before he was taken away from her due to neglect. Since then, L went from foster home to foster home. All I can say is that the system wasn\u2019t nice on him and he endured a lot in it. He has partial hearing loss, apparently has PTSD and behavioral issues due to his surroundings\n\nIm not sure how they got the information that we are his bio family, probably his bio mother finally told on T. I don\u2019t know if Im angrier about him never telling us that he got another girl pregnant or that he simply send her away\n\nAnyways, his social worker talked to my brother and asked him to take L in. T asked for a DNA test and its 100% his child. L was introduced to my family and, honestly, L is a lovely kid. Everyone thought he would be difficult to deal with, but he\u2019s just a kid who desperately needs a family and somewhere safe away everything he endured\n\nBut, T said that he was not going to take L in. He explained that he has another family now. To say i was angry is an understatement. I just can\u2019t understand how dare him, knowing everything he went through and knowing that if he says no, L will be forced back into this system that failed him countless times, to reject him\n\nI fought a lot with my brother, but he wouldn\u2019t budge, saying that he can\u2019t bring an unknown child with mental problems to his house that he has small children in\n\nSo yesterday, I reached out to his social worker and asked her if I could be the one to foster L. I explained to her my brothers motives (about the small children) and told her that I wouldn\u2019t have that problem since my children are older than L and it would be better for L to get used to his family that way. They liked the idea and started to look into it, and my brother was notified of that\n\nWe got in a new argument. He said that I have no right to do what I am doing, that L is not real family. I said that he is rejecting his rights as a father to L, so he couldn\u2019t tell me what to do with his child\n\nMy brother got involved. He scolded T, but said I over stepped when I asked to foster him, since he\u2019s still Ts child and it was obvious that he doesn\u2019t wants L around\n\nIm not changing my mind if im actually the asshole, i wont let L into this system again, but I want to if AITA", "created_utc": 1690640584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ctjxs/aita_for_fostering_my_nephew_against_my_brothers/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is trying to pretend this poor child never happened, and by having him around in the family he can't pretend.  Give that baby a good life!  NTA", "NTA! You're doing a great thing for that kid and you should feel proud of that. As for T he's probably just upset because either his wife doesn't know and he doesn't want her to find out, she knows but it causes tension because T probably lied for years about not having kids, or T is just that big of an A that he genuinely doesn't think anyone in his family should have anything to do with L because he already rejected him several times.\n\nThing is it's not T's choice, he had several chances to step up and be a father, but chose not to. You want to get to know your nephew and help him, there is nothing wrong with that. T is the one with the issues.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA your brother has disowned him so therefore he classes as an orphaned child (aware he has a mother, but she is out if the picture) You as a kind hearted human being are taking in this child. \n\nI guess you will never know what happened between the Mom and your brother, but for him to disown a child due to their mental status isn't right. It sounds like the rest of your family is also happy to disown him due to the mental issues which doesn't sound great either. They are being TA for not putting themselves in your shoes and seeing it from your point of view", "NTA - providing a child a loving home is one of the greatest things an adult can do. Kudos to you for volunteering to be this kid\u2019s hero.", "NTA for deciding to take care of the child, but don't expect L to ever be accepted by your brother or his wife and kids. You may just have accept some distance between you and him for a while.", "I think you\u2019re about to make a new family OP. Full of the good people and away from the crappy ones", "No judgement. I understand both of you. You want to help a kid and he doesn't want someone potentially harmful around his children.", "NTA, you are being the bigger person, and willing to take on a lot, this is what you do for family. Your brother wants to play, but does not want to pay, maybe he is embarrassed, but it is out now and hopefully the rest of the family takes him in and shows him what family can do for somoneone.", "ESH.  The 37 year old brother made some unfortunate choices when he was still (just a kid, basically)  But the variable missing is why he ghosted the mother of his child, as well as the child.  We might think that is extreme and un-necessary (or even irresponsible).  But sadly, it's possible to have a toxic girlfriend and get her prego before you realize that it's better not to have her in your life.  The fact that mother lost the child due to NEGLECT gives us some insight that (most likely) the mother would have been a severely toxic influence on anyone she was involved with.  Seeing that the father is 37 and STILL wants nothing to do with her, we must assume that the 37  year old honestly believes that he's better off without his EX having any contact with him or his family.\n\nBoil it down?  Best evidence suggests that it's a \"good  idea\" for 37M brother  to insist on no contact with his ex gf for both himself and his family.\n\nBut that doesn't mean your brother is totally innocent.  He should have been (at least) on the hook for child support, obviously.  So I judge him to be an AH if he hasn't at least been contributing financially to support his child.\n\nBut OP is an asshole for dragging the kid into close contact with the family, against the wishes of the 37M brother who is the bio dad of the kid.  See, you can't just foster the child.  It's a package deal.  You bring the kid into the family, and you are also bringing the MOM into the family.   37M brother is upset, as he doesn't want the toxic ex gf to bring her toxicity back to him, or any of his family.  But OP is using kid as an anchor to allow the toxic ex gf to get her hooks into the whole family now.  Yes, that is truly an AH move, for OP to do that to the younger brother and his family.\n\nI can understand the concern for a kid who  you have learned is your biological nephew.  But in this circumstance, there is no way forward that doesn't suck.  There are just degrees of suck.  Like, this situation sucks, but doing this will suck a bit less...\n\nBest outcome for all would be for the kid to be adopted in a closed adoption by a loving family that has no (zero) genetic relation.\n\n2nd best outcome would be foster with a family that is not related to OP.  But if OP still wants to help, OP could offer to support the kid financially, which is (unfortunately) more than the bio dad did.\n\n3rd best outcome would be for OP to foster the kid.  It would be great for the kid, obviously.  But don't be surprised if this causes a permanent rift between yourself and your brother.  He might ghost you and other family members.  Is it worth it to insert yourself into your nephew's life?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur brother is the AH.", "Nta. Your brother is for not wanting you to foster the kiddo. However I\u2019m going to say at the same time his logic for not wanting to take the child in is kinda sound. Taking in a child who has lived in the foster system and has been through a lot of damaging situations is a wild card and I get why your brother wouldn\u2019t want to expose his young kids to that. But him throwing away his kiddo is a huge issue. With that said. A child needs a loving and stable home. If you think you can provide it for her and you want to\u2026go for it!

Thanks for being a good person. The world needs more kindness.", "NTA. \n\nAnd good gracious, how horrible of your brothers for abandoning this poor baby. \n\nYou're an angel op, I hope you make tons of good memories with your new nephew and so do your kids and wife.

You're a good egg, OP.  Don't doubt yourself.  Your nephew needs someone in his corner.  <3", "You stood up to the challenge...and as a parent of a child with special needs/spectrum, be prepared for a long haul.  That said...little brother abandoned his child and your fostering him will be a perpetual reminder of his shame.  Perhaps it's a win win...Liam gets a home and as a result, it's unlikely you're little brother will be around much.", "NTA.\nT renounced all rights to an opinion on where L goes when T was a deadbeat who rejected his own son for the second time. He decided he wants nothing to do with him, so that's exactly what he gets. No vote, no opinion, no nothing. His voice does not count in this issue.\n\nYou're not the AH. Your brother, and everyone making excuses for and enabling him, are AHs.", "NTA and you may well be that young persons last hope. People can heal from trauma but it takes work and a lot of love and compassion along the way. Thank you for trying!", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. \n\nHowever - be sure you're going into this with your eyes wide open. Your nephew, by your account, has behavioral issues and PTSD. Sure, he's a nice kid. I believe this! But meeting him a few times isn't the same as living with him. You cannot expect him to be on his best behavior the whole time he's staying with you. A lot of foster and adoptive parents sorta think that's what's going to happen, or worse, that the child will be \"grateful\" to them, and... that's just not how it works.\n\nHe's probably already getting mental health care. Be sure that there's absolutely no gap in services when he comes to stay with you. Also be prepared to have your *own* therapist, because there is a nonzero chance that you're going to need somebody to talk to.", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.  Fostering a child because you want to give them a good home? 100% NTA.", "Your brother has abdicated his responsibilities, and has given up his right to have an opinion.

You are not an asshole for wanting to foster your nephew and give him a loving and stable home.\n\nYour brother is an asshole for abandoning his son, rejecting him again, and trying to stop you from helping him. \n\nHe has no right to call himself a father or to tell you what to do with L. He is the one who overstepped by being irresponsible and cruel. \n\nYour other brother is also an asshole for siding with him and not supporting you.\n\n You are doing the right thing, and I hope you and L can have a good relationship.", "NTA.

You have every right to step in, and you decided to so.\n\nThe brother that said since T doesn't want HIA SON around, you shouldn't foster him is dead wrong.\n\nL needs a place to land.  L is likely to be more broken remaining in the system for 3 more yrs and then being cycled out.  \n\nIt won't be easy.  I am sure there will be time where L lashes out, and tests you.  Kids do that.  You know, you have raised your children.\n\nTY for fostering your nephew.\n\nNTA", "The only thing I can add here is that many states have funding and support programs for college students who are current or former foster youth - as I see he is in HS now so this may become relevant soon. So, when he applies for college, please look into scholarship and program options for him as a former foster youth.", "Nta, but seek help and counseling for both of you, because you are taking on a teenager with a lot of trauma, and now you can add rejection from his bio father to that list. And frankly your brother's opinion isn't worth s***.", "If his wife and kids are in the same opinion of the brother then it's not a great loss.", "Thank you. I think I just had to listen to my brothers for too long and started to doubt myself a little", "I wont try to push a relationship with T, since im not even sure if i will remain contact him after all of this\n\nIf T one day would like to have a relationship with L, i would obviously be 100% happy to help it (if L is also ok with it), but i wont force it on my on him, especially since it can damage Ls mental health even further", "Im aware of the difficulties that fostering him will bring. My BIL is a child therapist and already talked with my wife about RAD and other issues children in the system can have. \n\nI don\u2019t expect any kind of gratitude from him. In my eyes, this is my responsibility, and i shouldn\u2019t expect praise from him for doing it. And after all, i brought this upon myself if he really turns out to be a difficult person to deal with.\n\nIm not sure if he is having mental health care, but im already having therapists recommendation just in case. I also already have a therapist I see once a month.\n\nIm sure this wont be easy, but im willing to try everything. \n\nThank you very much!", "Nope. If he could own a gun, drink, vote and be drafted, he can take responsibility. I'm really tired of this boys will be boys or boys mature slower than girls bs.

Everyone knows that the foster system here is brutal.  Your brother (T) is a despicable human being if he prefers his son stay in the foster system when there is a clear way out.", "It may be worth considering, for L's sake.\nI think it's wonderful that you're able to take L in, and that it's unquestionably better than him having to go back into the Foster system.\nBut my biggest hesitancy is that it puts him in the firing line with T. T not wanting anything to do with him is going to hurt, but L having to be around a father who very openly wants nothing to do with him and resent him being with you is likely to be extremely difficult on him, if not potentially damaging.", "Your wife is a real one \u2764\ufe0f", "Yessssss, go for it then", "Sadly you will have to protect L from the pain of more rejection. He\u2019ll know his father didn\u2019t want him, and that others in the family want nothing to do with him. \n\nKeep strong, keep him in therapy, and shower him with love and stability.", "Your brother has been a jerk since the day L's mom got pregnant, if not before", "Sounds like you're eyes are open to the reality that this WILL come with challenges,  which is good.  Talk to your therapist first, to get another view from someone who knows you but isn't family?", "She is. Im lucky I have her around", "I try to be realistic about things. It doesn\u2019t makes sense expecting him to be an angel to be around\n\nI will speak with my therapist soon, so it\u2019s ok\n\nThank you!", "\nHis solution is making L go back to the system and pretend he doesn\u2019t exist again. I wont let that happen to him. Maybe that is passive aggressive and he does feels like im disregarding him, but this isn\u2019t a simple subject. L is a person, his son, our blood. He is helpless at this point and needs help, and its not Ts feelings being hurt because he doesn\u2019t want L around that are going to change that\n\nI don\u2019t know the extent of Ls issues. We met him twice and my brother had one visitation with him alone. Both times i met him, he just looked like an anxious and quiet kid. The time my brother met him alone he also described him as such and there was so issues about his behavior.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know last comment. The issue is not exactly him rejecting L but forcing him back into a broken system that constantly fails him because he doesn\u2019t want L around. He already said no, so i took on my own hands to fix the issue, and its still a problem to T", "What exactly do you mean? His brother's \"feelings\"? He's abandoned his child, wanted nothing to do with him, and now he won't allow family members to look after HIS CHILD? \n\nThat child is innocent and he's suffered so much due to his parents. He's the victim in all this. OP can foster the child, and I'm so happy to see that he, unlike his brother, is a decent human being.\n\nThe brother's feelings, when compared to a traumatised child, mean f all. That child didn't ask to be born.", "If foster placement is working out, could you adopt him? Then you can stop talking about bro being his dad - in the end he is just sperm donator. You have already done more parenting than bro \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", ">Maybe that is passive aggressive and he does feels like im disregarding him,\n\nI'm not saying it is, i'm saying that i think he sees it that way. \n\nWeak people are always disturbed when strong people succeed. It's the same thing here. He hates that you are doing what he is incapable of doing.", "Don't bring the child where he has to see his dad be the perfect family to his other kids, you would be bringing him into a toxic environment if you take him since his dad clearly doesn't want him around....it's better for the kid to find a family who loves him unrelated to you guys", "I agree with everything you said. But i think that's how op's brother sees the situation (even if he obviously is wrong). Like i told op in another comment, his brother resents op for being strong enough to do what he is incapable of doing himself.", "True, that might be the case. But the brother needs to stop feeling sorry for himself and realise that his kid needs love. I can't even image what horrors he must've seen, for him to have PTSD from being in the foster care.\n\nThe brother doesn't have any feelings towards his son, which is fair enough, considering he abandoned him. But he should have the human decency to not be an asshole. He's not 22 anymore.", "I agree and i'm not defending him. I just answered op's question on why would brother won't let him and their sister to take care of L. The only thing i would say in his defense is that if (a very big if, and highly unlikely) L was violent towards his little children, he is right to not want him around them, because they're also innocent kids. \n\n>He's not 22 anymore.\n\nI don't think it's an age thing. I know a guy who was the most womanizing asshole, who had a few girlfriends at once and cheated on them, who thought of nothing other than having fun, anyway, a real prize. Long story short he became a single dad at 22 and now he is the kind of dad who bakes brownies for the kid's sleepover and is in all the mommy groups.", "And that I can understand, L being a danger to the brother's kids. We do not know how traumatised he has been, so it's highly possible.\n\nHowever, OP will have L. The kid won't be living in OP's brother's house. And by the way this whole drama has unfolded, I doubt OP will take L to their house anytime soon.", "According to op, he only saw him twice, but there were never any problems with his behaviour in his files. That's why i said it's highly unlikely, but then again, i seriously doubt someone actually paid him enough attention to notice his behaviour. And sometimes, traumatized kids act out more when they feel safe, when they aren't afraid anymore. Either way, and i don't mean that in a bad way, but L really needs therapy.", "Saying that he needs therapy isn't a bad thing, and I do agree with it. L needs all the help in the world."]}
