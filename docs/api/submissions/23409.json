We didn\u2019t had a lot of interactions and they broke up. He never told me exactly why\n\nWell, turns out he got her pregnant and when she told him, he simply said he didn\u2019t wanted nothing to do with her or the baby. She gave birth to L(15M), no one in my family knew about it since they never spoke again \n\nThe information that i got from his social worker isn\u2019t a lot, but this is everything I managed to gather: L and his mother lived together for two years before he was taken away from her due to neglect. Since then, L went from foster home to foster home. All I can say is that the system wasn\u2019t nice on him and he endured a lot in it. He has partial hearing loss, apparently has PTSD and behavioral issues due to his surroundings\n\nIm not sure how they got the information that we are his bio family, probably his bio mother finally told on T. I don\u2019t know if Im angrier about him never telling us that he got another girl pregnant or that he simply send her away\n\nAnyways, his social worker talked to my brother and asked him to take L in. T asked for a DNA test and its 100% his child. L was introduced to my family and, honestly, L is a lovely kid. Everyone thought he would be difficult to deal with, but he\u2019s just a kid who desperately needs a family and somewhere safe away everything he endured\n\nBut, T said that he was not going to take L in. He explained that he has another family now. To say i was angry is an understatement. I just can\u2019t understand how dare him, knowing everything he went through and knowing that if he says no, L will be forced back into this system that failed him countless times, to reject him\n\nI fought a lot with my brother, but he wouldn\u2019t budge, saying that he can\u2019t bring an unknown child with mental problems to his house that he has small children in\n\nSo yesterday, I reached out to his social worker and asked her if I could be the one to foster L. I explained to her my brothers motives (about the small children) and told her that I wouldn\u2019t have that problem since my children are older than L and it would be better for L to get used to his family that way. They liked the idea and started to look into it, and my brother was notified of that\n\nWe got in a new argument. He said that I have no right to do what I am doing, that L is not real family. I said that he is rejecting his rights as a father to L, so he couldn\u2019t tell me what to do with his child\n\nMy brother got involved. He scolded T, but said I over stepped when I asked to foster him, since he\u2019s still Ts child and it was obvious that he doesn\u2019t wants L around\n\nIm not changing my mind if im actually the asshole, i wont let L into this system again, but I want to if AITA\n\nEdit: I have no words to the amount of support im receiving. Thank you so much for the awards and your kind words. This just makes me sure im doing the right thing. \n\nIm already looking at the paperwork to get L with us and I\u2019m totally ignoring my extended family for now. If anyone is worried about my wife and kids, everyone at home is on board with this idea.\n\nAgain, thank you very much.

Your brother is trying to pretend this poor child never happened, and by having him around in the family he can't pretend.  Give that baby a good life!  NTA", "NTA! You're doing a great thing for that kid and you should feel proud of that. As for T he's probably just upset because either his wife doesn't know and he doesn't want her to find out, she knows but it causes tension because T probably lied for years about not having kids, or T is just that big of an A that he genuinely doesn't think anyone in his family should have anything to do with L because he already rejected him several times.\n\nThing is it's not T's choice, he had several chances to step up and be a father, but chose not to. You want to get to know your nephew and help him, there is nothing wrong with that. T is the one with the issues.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA your brother has disowned him so therefore he classes as an orphaned child (aware he has a mother, but she is out if the picture) You as a kind hearted human being are taking in this child. \n\nI guess you will never know what happened between the Mom and your brother, but for him to disown a child due to their mental status isn't right. It sounds like the rest of your family is also happy to disown him due to the mental issues which doesn't sound great either. They are being TA for not putting themselves in your shoes and seeing it from your point of view", "NTA - providing a child a loving home is one of the greatest things an adult can do. Kudos to you for volunteering to be this kid\u2019s hero.", "NTA for deciding to take care of the child, but don't expect L to ever be accepted by your brother or his wife and kids. You may just have accept some distance between you and him for a while.", "I think you\u2019re about to make a new family OP. Full of the good people and away from the crappy ones", "No judgement. I understand both of you. You want to help a kid and he doesn't want someone potentially harmful around his children.", "NTA, you are being the bigger person, and willing to take on a lot, this is what you do for family. Your brother wants to play, but does not want to pay, maybe he is embarrassed, but it is out now and hopefully the rest of the family takes him in and shows him what family can do for somoneone.", "ESH.  The 37 year old brother made some unfortunate choices when he was still (just a kid, basically)  But the variable missing is why he ghosted the mother of his child, as well as the child.  We might think that is extreme and un-necessary (or even irresponsible).  But sadly, it's possible to have a toxic girlfriend and get her prego before you realize that it's better not to have her in your life.  The fact that mother lost the child due to NEGLECT gives us some insight that (most likely) the mother would have been a severely toxic influence on anyone she was involved with.  Seeing that the father is 37 and STILL wants nothing to do with her, we must assume that the 37  year old honestly believes that he's better off without his EX having any contact with him or his family.\n\nBoil it down?  Best evidence suggests that it's a \"good  idea\" for 37M brother  to insist on no contact with his ex gf for both himself and his family.\n\nBut that doesn't mean your brother is totally innocent.  He should have been (at least) on the hook for child support, obviously.  So I judge him to be an AH if he hasn't at least been contributing financially to support his child.\n\nBut OP is an asshole for dragging the kid into close contact with the family, against the wishes of the 37M brother who is the bio dad of the kid.  See, you can't just foster the child.  It's a package deal.  You bring the kid into the family, and you are also bringing the MOM into the family.   37M brother is upset, as he doesn't want the toxic ex gf to bring her toxicity back to him, or any of his family.  But OP is using kid as an anchor to allow the toxic ex gf to get her hooks into the whole family now.  Yes, that is truly an AH move, for OP to do that to the younger brother and his family.\n\nI can understand the concern for a kid who  you have learned is your biological nephew.  But in this circumstance, there is no way forward that doesn't suck.  There are just degrees of suck.  Like, this situation sucks, but doing this will suck a bit less...\n\nBest outcome for all would be for the kid to be adopted in a closed adoption by a loving family that has no (zero) genetic relation.\n\n2nd best outcome would be foster with a family that is not related to OP.  But if OP still wants to help, OP could offer to support the kid financially, which is (unfortunately) more than the bio dad did.\n\n3rd best outcome would be for OP to foster the kid.  It would be great for the kid, obviously.  But don't be surprised if this causes a permanent rift between yourself and your brother.  He might ghost you and other family members.  Is it worth it to insert yourself into your nephew's life?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur brother is the AH.", "Nta. Your brother is for not wanting you to foster the kiddo. However I\u2019m going to say at the same time his logic for not wanting to take the child in is kinda sound. Taking in a child who has lived in the foster system and has been through a lot of damaging situations is a wild card and I get why your brother wouldn\u2019t want to expose his young kids to that. But him throwing away his kiddo is a huge issue. With that said. A child needs a loving and stable home. If you think you can provide it for her and you want to\u2026go for it!

I'm sorry he has to see what an ass his sermon donor is.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a loser and honestly it sounds like you are better off without him in your life.

Your other brother sucks as well. Save that kid and don't look back, and frankly, lord it over your two brothers as much as you can.

Just because your brother doesn't want his son, that doesn't mean his family doesn't want him. Take the kid and help him through the trauma of being in the system.

I know the kid has some mental and physical health issues.  But OP assumed those issues were caused by some judge ordering the kid into foster care.  Not necessarily.  It's just as likely that the kid's issues were caused directly by two years of abuse and neglect inflicted on him by his bio mom.  In other words, the kid was probably damaged (as much as he is now) before he entered foster care and that is WHY he ended up in foster care.  I'm making assumptions also, but based on the best evidence, my guess is probably closer to the truth.\n\nHow to illustrate?  Let's say kid is a toddler still living with bio mom.  He chases a runaway ball (or kitten, or whatever) into the street and gets hit by a car.  Unfortunately, he ends up in a wheelchair.  Then later, he is taken away from bio mom because bio mom was literally abusing him.  Then he meets his bio UNCLE about \\~12 years later.  When uncle sees him wheelchair bound, uncle reacts with, \"OH MY GOD...what has FOSTER CARE done to you?!?!?!??!?\"\n\nIf his uncle is his foster for the final \\~2 years of foster care, is it going to get the kid to ditch the wheelchair and start running again?   \n\nLook, I can see this from the emotional/illogical angle.  Uncle's heart is in the  right place.  He wants to be the hero, to save this kid from his past.  I'm not sure uncle can do that, but I do not question his motive to TRY.\n\nUncle has a difficult choice to make, and he can clearly blame his younger brother for being an idiot \\~16 years ago, which forced uncle into this predicament now.\n\nIt boils down to...Does OP wish to exchange a brother for a nephew?

He's most likely looking at the bounced around until he's 18 and then kicked to the curb.\n\nNo, not at all.  Let's assume kid is put back into foster care with a family with no genetic relation.  Or maybe he gets \"bounced around\" from one family to another.  That won't last long, as he will be 18 soon.  \n\nBut then, he's not \"kicked to the curb\".

He's got a family to watch out for him now.  \n\nSo, does that mean I support OP fostering the nephew?  Not necessarily.  As I wrote earlier, this foster the nephew thing probably boils down to a choice between a brother and a nephew (choose one only).  And that choice sucks.  \n\nBut looking forward, after the kid is out of foster care (just two years away now).  The legal adult can maintain close ties to uncle, and other family members and (most likely) bio dad won't get too upset about that.\n\nIf OP plays this right, he might have a good relationship with his nephew without destroying his relationship with his brother.

But most foster parents are really good parents.  Is it possible the kid in this scenario met some bad foster parents?  Sure, that's possible.  But not known.\n\nWhat IS KNOWN:  Some judge at some point declared bio mom to be unfit due to abuse and neglect.

Or do we blame bio mom?  What fits the known evidence?  What is most likely to be true?\n\nI'm assuming bio mom is the villain.

I\u2019m lucky to have amazing support from people close to me, they are all looking out for me to make sure I don\u2019t open myself up to anymore emotional trauma from him but they know I have to do this. As I say I need to be able to sleep at night but it is my personal choice. Thank you for the reminder though. It can be easy to lose yourself in situations like this.", "Im doing what I need to do to be able to sleep at night. A few years back we had a neighbour whose wife passed after a battle with cancer. She was a lovely woman and a friend of ours. We tried so hard to look after her at the end, we are similar in ages to her son who was extremely grateful to us for having supported her and walked her dog daily and things when she couldn\u2019t. Her husband was a vile man. Physically disabled but he was verbally and emotionally abusive to her and quite frankly to me also when we kept helping him with the care of her dog after she passed (I was not going to let the poor dog suffer because of my feelings towards him and that dog was her joy so I did it for her). Of course because of the person he was there was no one who wanted to help him in any way so I did the same for him. I contacted his doctors and registered concerns for his well-being and reported the situation to adult social services to make sure that he was provided what was needed for the future. Once it was in place I was done and he is still getting what is needed fro what I hear (we moved away). I certainly didn\u2019t do it for him and quite honestly I didn\u2019t even do it on behalf of his wife as I know she would have told me to let him rot (but she would have been eternally grateful for us looking after her dog). I did it because it was the right thing to do and I wanted to be able to sleep at night. \nI\u2019ll do the same here. The reason this is more difficult it because it is far more emotionally complex but once it is all in place I can step away and know I did the decent thing as a human being and leave it there. I do get that it is hard to understand but I am doing it for myself ultimately. I need to to feel right about my actions so I can gain closure.", "Thank you for the reminder. I completely agree and am a firm believer that you cut toxic people out of your life no matter who they are. I am doing this for my own peace though. I will not be involved in his long term care but I am just making sure it is set up so he is registered within the systems he needs to be. Strangely enough the dementia seems to have made him a much nicer person for the moment.", "The issue with that is he may not find a good family. He may continue to suffer abuse in the system, and feel even more abandoned when literally all of his bio dad's family reject him.", "He's 15. It's very, very unlikely for him to find a permanent placement at this age, frankly. It's a whole lot more likely for him to be bounced between shitty homes.", "Well the boy has a social worker assigned to him\u2026 which is whom I suspect op has gotten the information that mom is no longer involved in his nephews life\u2026 since it sounds like the kids never been back in his mothers care since entering the system indicates her parental rights have probably been terminated ..", "I don\u2019t get why you think the baby mom would be in this equation at all. This kid has been in the foster system since he was 2. She hasn\u2019t had custody, been his legal guardian, or likely had any contact besides something supervised (assuming she cared to make that happen in the first place) for 13 years; he hasn\u2019t had parents for 13 years. OP said no one even knows where the baby mom is or if she\u2019s even in-state\u2014 why the hell would she randomly materialize now, JUST to stir up trouble in the family of this person she\u2019s had no contact with for 16 years, with the information we have?\n\nAlso, if brother had told his family about having fathered a child, again literally where and why are you getting that bio mom would be an inescapable part of that equation? *How* would it \u201csubject the whole family to the toxic influence of the baby mama\u201d? Do you think she\u2019d be hanging out with them, or at family dinners? No! If he had told the family about the son, what actually would have happened is that they would have been able to intervene and the son wouldn\u2019t have had to go into the system when his mom lost custody. The son *had* safe family who could have taken him in (no bio mom needed, dude), or at least could have been present as an advocate for him. That option was taken away from everyone, by the brother. The brother subjected his son to an entire life (to date) of unending trauma when there *was* family that could have helped. Again, the mom isn\u2019t part of this, she has no legal rights to this child!", "Very glad you have that support person who will drag you back when you start giving too much!  But I think it's beautiful that you're helping him \\*within boundaries\\*.  <3", "I almost needed up in the foster system due to my moms severe mental health issues, I can\u2019t imagine the trauma this kid went through. You are NTA by miles. Maybe just consider how you will navigate your brothers potential behavior towards L and how this will impact family gatherings or how it will make L feel. You didn\u2019t overstep. The kid needs a home. Good on you to take care of him", "NTA.  You may not know this yet, but T is going to have to pay child support to the state, bc the state is fostering (supporting) his child.  This is likely at least part of why T is mad.", "You are a rare, wonderful. Lovely person. Nta. And thank you!!", "Nta. Just like he doesn\u2019t want L around, don\u2019t want your brother around. He\u2019s a deadbeat and the way he\u2019s treating him to this day solidifies that. Who cares if he\u2019s there for his younger children. He\u2019s choosing to be cruel to this kid for no reason. He deserves to be cut off.", "NTA.  You deserve a medal.  I wish you all the best in parenting this little boy.", "Fuck your brothers. You are this kids family and you want to take him and give him the live he needs and deserve. You're awesome. NTA", "NTA. Am I wrong in thinking there's a fair amount of dysfunction, trauma and/or abuse in your family's past?", "I\u2019m suspecting that your sarcasm has gone over some heads here", "Other brother might also have an unclaimed kid out there as well judging by his behavior. OP is NTA", "Oh, it still hits. That low expectation doesn\u2019t mitigate any of it.", ">OP will respect T's wishes and keep L away from him; however, this also means that T won't see OP or OP's family anymore since L is now a part of OP's family.\n\nI hope so, sounds like the kid has been through a lot and doesn't need his sperm donor around if he doesn't enthusiastically want to be. \n\nit's really heat-warming the young man already appreciates the newfound family, especially cause 15 is a notoriously moody age. \n\nGood Luck OP!! You've got a lot of internet stranger rooting for you", "You're a real one too, mate.", "If that's what you feel you need to do to gain closure then I applaud you for your efforts and wish you only the best in life.", ">he hasn\u2019t had parents for 13 years.\n\nTell that to the face of any foster parent, anywhere.  (Maybe don some protective clothing first?)\n\n\"The brother subjected his son to an entire life (to date) of unending trauma when there was family that could have helped.\"\n\nSigh.  We can't undo the past, and this thread is not about that.  The little brother is not here posting \"AITA for abandoning my kid and his baby momma?\"\n\nOP asked about himself/uncle fostering the kid starting around age 16.  My judgement would have been totally different 15 or 16 years ago.  As the saying goes, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube....\n\nAnd in this case, trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube is likely to cause a huge rift in the family.  I don't see the sense, as there are other ways OP could help the kid.", "I mentioned in another comment but the dementia has actually made him a much nicer person for the moment. Obviously that will all change as it progresses but at least he is bearable as a person while I get things sorted.", "Glad to hear that!  You don't need him making this any harder!", "NTA If T refuses to take responsibility for his own kid then he has no say in who CPS places him with. It's great that you're willing to step up and help your nephew.", "Nta.   You and your wife areva blessing gor this kid.  He needs someone.", "You're a God damn super hero. Screw Superman and Wonderwoman, you're the real deal. Keep doing what you are doing.", "Sounds like ur brother basically wants to forget this kid exists, I\u2019m glad he had u, as a child of the system u taking him in could honestly change the corse of his life! But plz NEVER let T be alone with L I\u2019m legit worried he would hurt him", "NTA, but I wish they could have reunited L with your family before he went through all that he\u2019ll. L didn\u2019t ask to be born. Then to be rejected by both parents?! This is one of the most heartbreaking stories but you make the difference. Please be there for your nephew", "Can I say \u201cyou are the angel\u201d?\n\nNTA\n\nand fuck your brother and his fragile ego.", "NTA\n\nIf you want to foster ANY  child that is your choice. That  one is related by blood and actually family,  cherry on the cake. \n\nYour brother is being a dick and doesn't want to be reminded of his choices at the cost of someone elses  life. \n\nThe kid is 15, he what knows his biological father rejected him,  at least he can have a few years with a caring family.", "ESH", "Your brother disgusts me. NTA. You and your wife are amazing people for taking your nephew in. I hope that poor kid gets all the love, affection, and attention he can handle.", "Thank you, same to yourself (the best in life\u2026I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need closure lol!)", "NTA\n\nYou're doing the right thing, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You doing this will forever paint them as bad guys who abandoned their family and the kid will be a constant reminder of it. That's why they're mad. Both the father and your other brother are gonna have to face the fact that they're embarrassments but they aren't ready to accept it.", "NTA you\u2019re a good person and I wish you all the best in the upcoming housing of  your nephew.", "You need to ask? You're a HERO. NTA. \n\nT is going to be terminally embarrassed every time L is around. That's why he's unhappy. His secrets are exposed: T ran from responsibility, hid the truth from your family, and continues to reject L. No one is going to approve, and T already feels judged. He knows he should do better. No one likes to be considered with contempt. He deserves it though.", "NTA - your An amazing person.  And both of your brothers are trash.  T for abandoning a child and utterly and selfishly trying to even prevent him from having any family, total trash.  Your other brother for somehow thinking T\u2019s opinion is more important then the literal life of a child, a child he abandoned into foster care.\n\nLook at this as a blessing, you now know who the assholes and trash are in your family", "Your brother is inhumane. He's denying his own child and then getting mad because you want to help him. How do your parents feel about this?", "Vile, disgusting, pathetic man.", "Logical persona acting illogical\u2026. May mean he has ulterior motives\u2026. Might had a kid as well and not want to set a precedent", "Read up on secondary trauma... it almost took me out because I didn't understand what was happening.  \n\nYou're doing a good thing and you seem really realistic in your expectations.", "It'll be very different from the parenting you're used to but if you keep reminding yourself where the behaviour is coming from (fear and trauma) it's a lot easier. \n\nAlso there's loads of resources out there these days for understanding stuff like this. There's whole 'care experienced' online communities just desperate to help. Seek them out, they've been a game changer for me. (So much better than some of the 'professional advice')"]}
