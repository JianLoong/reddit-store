I've been very open to her about situations in my life as she's always invited me to treat her as the older sister I never had. I introduced her to my mother and even had her stay at my home for a while. She told me she had to move out from where she was, (she never told me why) because I grew to love her as a sister, I asked my mom if she could stay with us and she agreed. We made the space, my baby sister moved into my room with me, and collegue (Cassie) got her own room. \n\nShe never purchased any groceries neither paid any bills.\n\nAbout 7/8months later she just walked in the house with a suit case, went to her room, and left.  All she said was \"bye\" and dropped her keys on the counter. My mom and I were confused, but we didn't say anything. I know we didn't mistreat her or show her any bad faces. We gave her all that she needed. I figured she'd call or something g and explain  what happened, but she didn't.  I didn't run her down for an explanation either.\n\nAbout a year later, around Christmas, she told me that she didn't want to be by herself and asked if she could stay with us for the period. My mom and I agreed , and she came and spent a couple of days. We made plans to go on a road trip, which would take most of the day. She said she would come as soon as she finished working. \"We work in different locations.\" She never came. She had my mom and I waiting all day, and she never even called. \n\nYou might think I'm stupid at this point. Sometime in between Cassie and Sabrina (Cassie's BFF/other co-worker from another country) wanted to have a road trip, and they invited me. I agreed. I assumed I'd have to drive them since Cassie didn't have a car   and didn't want to get one because of some mental trauma. She's terrified of driving... as it turns it she does have a car and she does drive she just never told me about it. \n\nAfter that, I decided to drop all contact with her. I've stopped replying g to her texts or answering her calls. I wanted to bow out of her life gracefully. \n\nSometime later, she told me that she really doesn't have a place to stay as she can't pay the rent to her landlord anymore. (She found this place before she moved out of my house and didn't even tell me about it at first.) She really really needed a place to stay just until she gets back on her feet. I told her that my house was under renovations and space is really limited right now. She still insisted and I just never responded.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675007277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10oapa1/aita_for_leaving_my_collegue_without_a_place_to/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
