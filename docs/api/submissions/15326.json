I was a little bit drunk, had a good time and was also just carefree. So without thinking to much about it I made a dumb joke along the lines of: \"If I were to hug my mom I'd probably be jailed as a gravedigger.\" I didn't say these exact words but it was in a similar taste. Then this dude turns to me and almost seems angry and just says I'd better shut up because that's really distasteful. I felt pretty bummed afterwards and almost a little bit violated because it's just how I grief and someone tried to take that away from me and shame me for it. I just like to make dark humor as a sort of coping mechanism. My mom already died 5-6 years ago and I went to therapy so it isn't recent or anything.

My dad has been dead for almost 21 years now, I'm mixed race but white passing (this is relevant to my story, I swear) and my father is/was Pakistani, a few months ago I went on a first date and the guy I was with asked if my dad was pale skinned too, and I had to stop myself from replying, \"Honestly, I'm not sure if he's still got skin at this point.\" I told the guy I couldn't tell him what I was thinking but gently informed him my dad had died, and he's welcome to ask questions about it but it's why I talk about my dad in the past tense.\n\nLater on in the date he asked what I'd stopped myself from saying... So I told him. And he just went totally blank for 5 minutes. He was clearly not my person. Whilst I was travelling home I messaged all my friends and told them exactly what happened. They all almost cried laughing. They are my people.\n\nI hope you find your people and never feel bad for your humour, there are plenty of us out here.", "I would want my children to make dark jokes about me being dead.

This is a fundamental rule that few here on this sub seem to be aware of, because everyone here always seems to cheer on tit for tat. Telling OP to shut up was rude.

Having someone repeat a lame joke, and having people not laugh at it twice can make a person realize they shouldn't have said it. It's especially effective to pretend to take someone seriously and show concern for that person, makes them feel like a heel without you being rude. 3. You can react with stony silence that makes it clear you heard and understood the joke, but did not think it was funny. 4. You can calmly but adamently say \"I'm sorry, but I don't think that is funny.\" I save 3 and 4 for blatantly racist, sexist, homophonic, ableist, or violence-tinged jokes.

That will hurt other people and might invalidate their feelings.
