I was a little bit drunk, had a good time and was also just carefree. So without thinking to much about it I made a dumb joke along the lines of: \"If I were to hug my mom I'd probably be jailed as a gravedigger.\" I didn't say these exact words but it was in a similar taste. Then this dude turns to me and almost seems angry and just says I'd better shut up because that's really distasteful. I felt pretty bummed afterwards and almost a little bit violated because it's just how I grief and someone tried to take that away from me and shame me for it. I just like to make dark humor as a sort of coping mechanism. My mom already died 5-6 years ago and I went to therapy so it isn't recent or anything.

My dad has been dead for almost 21 years now, I'm mixed race but white passing (this is relevant to my story, I swear) and my father is/was Pakistani, a few months ago I went on a first date and the guy I was with asked if my dad was pale skinned too, and I had to stop myself from replying, \"Honestly, I'm not sure if he's still got skin at this point.\" I told the guy I couldn't tell him what I was thinking but gently informed him my dad had died, and he's welcome to ask questions about it but it's why I talk about my dad in the past tense.\n\nLater on in the date he asked what I'd stopped myself from saying... So I told him. And he just went totally blank for 5 minutes. He was clearly not my person. Whilst I was travelling home I messaged all my friends and told them exactly what happened. They all almost cried laughing. They are my people.\n\nI hope you find your people and never feel bad for your humour, there are plenty of us out here.", "I would want my children to make dark jokes about me being dead.

Such as when someone says they fucked my mum when I'm playing a video game, I reply with \"Oh, so you fucked the piece of ground some twats kicked my mother's ashes over!?\"\n\n- my mother's ashes were in a community urn outside the church, until some kids from the next village over, kicked and broke the urn to pieces... What a bunch of Twats!", "NTA. Please, my mom made jokes about being an orphan on the day she learned her mom passed away. You're fine, don't worry.", "NAH - sounds like a classic \u201cknow your audience\u201d situation. Dark humor is great, but not for everyone. In the future maybe hold off on making jokes like in a group you don\u2019t know", "NTA - it's how you cope but you don't know what people around you are dealing with. If someone has a sick/recently deceased mom it's gonna hit hard. Save it for when you're around people you know.", "NTA the other day a someone asked how my dad was. I said I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d need a ouija board to find out. Took them a second to figure out what I meant. It was funny.", "NTA. Someone who doesn't know you judged you for a joke you made because they were uncomfortable. You're not responsible for some stranger's feelings. TBH, I have the same kind of humor and thought it was a funny joke. Grieve how you want, that's all that matters.", "NTA. It\u2019s your mom and your grief. Dark humor is how I get thru life.", "NTA. My dad died and it was very difficult. At the time my close friends who had lost their fathers banded together to support me and we all used humour as a coping mechanism. After he died we formed Dead Dad's Club and we meet every fathers day to joke around and have lunch. Some people don't get the dark humour, but you gotta be in the club to understand. You keep doing you!", "I mean. You can make dark jokes all you want but don't expect everyone to laugh along with you.", "YTA... A little bit. You can deal with grief however you want. If you want to make jokes, that's on you. If you're in a room full of people you don't know talking about how much they love their moms, maybe it isn't the time to make that kind of joke though. Consider the atmosphere.\n\nAlso, not everyone likes dark humor... One person being uncomfortable with dead mom jokes does not discount your entire grieving experience. Just think a little more critically about the audience before telling them.", "NTA", "Slight YTA, Hate to say it but there is a time and place for dead parent jokes.  It is okay to joke as a coping mechanism, but I just feel like at a birthday party might not be the best place.", "NTA.\n\nI have a dead mom. I laughed.", "NTA. Some of us use dark humor as a coping mechanism. I am some of us.", "NTA at all. Watch Daniel Sloss\u2019 comedy show Dark and read his book Everyone You Hate is Going to Die. He\u2019s really good at talking about how it is making jokes about a dead relative and how absolutely horrible people are at handling it", "NTA. You're allowed to speak about your experience with your mom any way you want to. Other ppl's discomfort with how you relate to your own life experience is not your problem, it's theirs.", "NTA. You were making the joke about your own mother. Too bad for him. You\u2019d fit in well with my friends. We are all about gallows humour.", "NTA at all. My dad passed away 14 years ago and my sister and I both use \"dead dad jokes\" as a way to cope with it. It doesn't mean we don't miss him; but it definitely has helped us both cope with it. My fiancee and friends will crack the occasional joke about it now around me too and it sounds really morbid, but it helps in a weird way.", "NTA\n\nMy dad died when I was 9, and my younger siblings and I make jokes about it all the time. I have known other people who lost parents young who also do this. I honestly believe it's a very common cope/catharsis. \n\nIf you were making a dead parent joke about someone else's parent, then there would be an issue, but no, I don't think anyone else should be telling you what to say on this matter.", "NTA", "NAH you made a joke about your own deceased mother. Someone there was disturbed by your dark humour and stated as much. He didn\u2019t enjoy your joke and he doesn\u2019t have to. You made a dark joke and you didn\u2019t have to. Best way woulda been to apologise for upsetting him and move on", "Um, spoiler, everyone dies. Perfectly normal to make jokes (like yours) about it. NTA", "NTA you are allowed to make whatever jokes about ur mom u want.", "NTA fuck that guy", "I\u2019m going w/ NAH. I get using dark humor as a coping mechanism- I do it myself. But you need to be able to read your audience. I think you failed to do that in this situation & the other person did not find your comment humorous. Chalk it up as a learning experience.", "I\u2019ll steal your joke for my dad also NTA", "My father died in 2010.  He always joked that he wanted to come back as the spoiled rotten dog I had growing up.\n\nMy mother got a four-year-old dog in 2014.  Maybe we're just projecting, but the dog will frequently do things that remind us of Dad.  We'll even call him Dad, Jr.!  (I figured it up, and puppy was likely conceived a week or so after Dad died!)\n\nSome people would likely be horrified at that.  I have a fairly dark sense of humor (occupational hazard).  It brings us comfort to think Dad is still with us.\n\nOP, NTA.  Dark humor at your own \"expense\" is rarely a problem.", "But OP get to inflict his dark coping mechanism on a stranger? Funny how no one can tell OP what to do but everyone else just has to be okay with their actions and have zero agency.", "Dealing with grief differently doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to tolerate or be subjected to it at all times. \n\nThey were having a nice, happy conversation about their moms. If OP couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to participate then he should\u2019ve removed himself, not try to change the vibe by making dark jokes.\n\nAnd dark humor is called that for a reason. People need to understand that some won\u2019t find it funny and accept the reactions.", "Agreed. My 15 year olds father died when she was 7. Tbf, he was an alcoholic and wasn't in her life much at all due to this, and died as a direct result of alcoholism, but she uses dark humor to cope. People are constantly like, \"Oh my god, (daughter's name)!!\" And laugh awkwardly at her morbid jokes. But like, why would they be offended? Most people didn't even know him so it's def not abt that, which seems similar to OPs situation. Like I could get if she said this to her grandma and she was upset she spoke of her child that way, but these are people who didn't know OPs mother. Definitely NTA.", "Some former family friends who I literally grew up with no longer speak to me because they got *so offended* that when we were looking at old family pictures from 10 years ago and said their dad looked so much better then, I chimed in with \u201cmy dad looked so much better 10 years ago too! I don\u2019t think a wooden box is his best look.\u201d (He\u2019d died like two months ago.)\n\nOP is for sure NTA but boy do some people not know how to react if you joke about death, and especially if you\u2019re in America.", "I get asked all the time, where is your husband???\n\nI give the name of town, that has the largest cemetery in the metroplex.   I let my friends fill in the blanks from blank stares.\n\nI use humor, as grief management - otherwise, I\u2019d never get out of bed.", "Because he was part of the general conversation perhaps? Have you even considered that maybe Angry Dude had lost his mom too and OP's comment hurt? Why is only OP allowed to react like he wants to?", "\"if this guy has an issue, why is he listening\"\n\nWhat a weird take lol Imagine someone says a bunch of homophobic and racist shit then is like \"well if you have an issue why are you listening??\"", "Loooool", "Your sister worded it beautifully! Sorry for your loss", "My family went to the movies after my mom passed. It had been an in-home hospice situation, and my dad decided we all needed to get out of the house. I didn't love the idea initially, but ultimately it worked for us. And looking back on that day I can remember seeing the movie, and getting food after, instead of sitting around at home, with a big empty bed in the living room.", "Thank you! I felt the same way myself about OP after reading his post. Including rolling my eyes at him feeling \u201cviolated\u201d that his crass joke was found to be crass.", "He also said he was at someone's *birthday* party and that he hardly knew anyone there. This was not the audience or the environment to make that kind of joke.", "Probably because they don\u2019t remember exactly what they said.", "OP didn\u2019t make a joke at any ones expense.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Most people that know me get it. Those that don't? They aren't worth knowing my grief.", "Just because OP is free to say what he wants doesn't mean the other person has to be okay with it. Everybody can respond how they like. He told OP to shut up, so he does have agency.", "People keep saying \u201cwell it\u2019s MY grief, \u201cthis is how I cope\u201d while also thinking they have the right to subject other people to it.", "Absolutely. Some people are so precious about the dead and have more respect for them than the people who are alive and trying to cope with the loss.  Your daughter sounds like she is coping well with a bad situation.", "We took an urn full of fireplace ash to dinner with us for mother's day after my mom died, and pretended it was her, and spilled it on the table. She told us to do it before she died. It was her friend's restaurant, and they always pranked each other. It was hysterical. He admitted she won!", "Your last line there is something I use all the time. People come to my house for the first time and as I\u2019m showing them around I gesture to the urn and say something like \u201cand here\u2019s where my mom sits to judge my poor decisions\u201d\n\nPeople never know how to react, but I find it hilarious lol", "Sounds like my mom\u2014I miss her but I still laugh at the dark humor we shared! I have a little mini urn (because she told me she expected me to keep her in a baggie in my pocket so she wouldn\u2019t miss anything!) We watch tv together!", "His enquiry came from compassion so yes, I said something like \"Sorry to have to tell you.\" I hope that I used the term \"passed away\" rather than \"popped her clogs/ fell off the twig.\" I want my epitaph to read \"Next time read the bloody instructions.\" I'm only going to do this once, so I want to do it right.", "It is also possible that he or a loved one recently suffered a personal loss, like a mother or other parental figure, and it triggered deep emotions or they could have been trying to protect someone else nearby that they knew was in that situation.", "He can shut his mouth", "You never know what the other person has experienced though. They may have lost someone recently. And if they don\u2019t know the guy, it might take a beat to realize what he\u2019s getting at. Plus the joke wasn\u2019t funny.", "Most definitely. He had a sarcastic and joyful sense of humor. He would have loved it :)", "Thank you. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to be downvoted to the gates of hell, even though everyone inherently knows that you should know your audience and watch your timing when making certain jokes. If I were OP\u2019s friend, I\u2019d think his quip was funny, but as a stranger at a party with aging parents\u2014 not so much.", "There\u2019s a lot of \u201cyou can do whatever you want and don\u2019t owe anybody anything\u201d creeping over society and it\u2019s increasingly common on social media. So it\u2019s sadly not surprising that people here think OP can say whatever he wants at someone else\u2019s party even when it completely goes against the tone of the conversation and think that he was completely in the right.", "But is it so stupid when op makes a joke about dead mothers while they are having a conversation about how they love their mothers? Its just weird as hell. Like if someone was talking about how they love their cat. And you switch the topic to your dead cat. How is that reasonable? And how are they supposed to react otherwise? Either they laugh at your dead parent or its incredibly awkward. There's no winning when you say that kind of thing in that kind of situation.", "[removed]", "At 16 my wife found her mom in a coma and had to help her dad get her downstairs and into his truck. It's still something she has nightmares about, although EMDR has helped that one. She makes dead parent jokes because it honestly helps her to process it.\n\nShe also jokes about bringing her dad's ashes to things he'd have liked and wants to get Dolly Parton to sign his container.", "Exactly! That is precisely the point I wanted to get across but you made it beautifully and succinctly.", "I can\u2019t even stand how fucking funny that is. Cheers to your mom", "I don\u2019t, which is completely rubbish of me and I damn well shall from now on- what a great idea! She\u2019d love that.", "I asked my boyfriend of 12 years if when he dies, if I could keep his skull and put hats on it during the holidays.

Generally just \u2018shut up, I didn\u2019t ask you\u2026 no, you can\u2019t have any, it would make you all slushy\u2019 when I\u2019m bringing in a bottle of wine to drink on my own, or something like that.\n\nLike talking to a cat, but the cat doesn\u2019t move, never hugs me any more (rude, except for instructing strangers to set fire to her I\u2019ve been a great daughter), and is a dead woman in a very handsome antique rumtopf.", "Not only that, he was meeting these people for the first time. He has no idea what's acceptable in their social circle. IMO you don't go around tossing out dark humor then get mad when someone says 'Hey, that's fucked up. Can you not?
