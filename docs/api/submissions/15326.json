I was a little bit drunk, had a good time and was also just carefree. So without thinking to much about it I made a dumb joke along the lines of: \"If I were to hug my mom I'd probably be jailed as a gravedigger.\" I didn't say these exact words but it was in a similar taste. Then this dude turns to me and almost seems angry and just says I'd better shut up because that's really distasteful. I felt pretty bummed afterwards and almost a little bit violated because it's just how I grief and someone tried to take that away from me and shame me for it. I just like to make dark humor as a sort of coping mechanism. My mom already died 5-6 years ago and I went to therapy so it isn't recent or anything.

My dad has been dead for almost 21 years now, I'm mixed race but white passing (this is relevant to my story, I swear) and my father is/was Pakistani, a few months ago I went on a first date and the guy I was with asked if my dad was pale skinned too, and I had to stop myself from replying, \"Honestly, I'm not sure if he's still got skin at this point.\" I told the guy I couldn't tell him what I was thinking but gently informed him my dad had died, and he's welcome to ask questions about it but it's why I talk about my dad in the past tense.\n\nLater on in the date he asked what I'd stopped myself from saying... So I told him. And he just went totally blank for 5 minutes. He was clearly not my person. Whilst I was travelling home I messaged all my friends and told them exactly what happened. They all almost cried laughing. They are my people.\n\nI hope you find your people and never feel bad for your humour, there are plenty of us out here.", "I would want my children to make dark jokes about me being dead.

Some people are too sensitive. Everyone dies, it\u2019s just a joke.", "ah, only saw the part where it said that the guy turned to op after the joke, apologies.\n\nregardless, it\u2019s still stupid to get mad at someone making a joke about their own mother,", "unfortunately jokes are easier to see in hindsight than in the moment", "Trying to judge one comment in isolation can be hard because we don\u2019t know the rest of the context.  The particular joke might have been inappropriate for that particular conversation (e.g., if someone had just made a comment about their mother being really ill and OP proceeded to make a dead mom joke).  Or the guy may have been annoyed because OP had been making marginally relevant attention-seeking jokes the whole conversation.  It\u2019s important to read the room before making an off-color joke that may not land well unless you can accept people thinking you\u2019re TA (in which case there\u2019s no need to run here for validation that you\u2019re not).", "Nah, some people are too sensitive."]}
