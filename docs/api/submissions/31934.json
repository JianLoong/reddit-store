Since I met him he had a four door, large pickup truck. In August of 2022 it broke down & would cost up to 10k to fix. Since then, it has been sitting in front of our home basically rotting (we have a driveway & then gravel in the front of our home for more parking, the truck is in the gravel). \n\nHis mother had bought him the car, and it is \u201ctechnically\u201d hers so he wanted to see what she would like to do with it. She said she wants to try to sell it but no action has been taken. Well it\u2019s been over a year and the truck is still sitting in front of our home. \n\nIt came to a head today when I asked him for the 10th time what is going on with the truck, I would like it gone by the end of the year. He became annoyed with me and told me to back off because he\u2019s handling it. I told him he clearly isn\u2019t, it\u2019s been over a year and he has done nothing to sell or move the truck. He has barely had any conversations with his mom about next steps. I kinda lost it and told him he was a lazy pos and if the truck was not gone by the end of the year I was calling a tow truck (the tags are expired and it does not start). He told me I was an AH and it wasn\u2019t a priority for him and that I have no right to tow his truck. \n\nFor more info we live on a street with 6 other houses & no neighbors have complained. \n\nAITAH for wanting the truck moved & threatening to do it myself?\n\nEDIT: y\u2019all I have not only asked very politely at least 10 times over the past year but I have offered to list it, spoke to his mom with no avail, we have had people come to the house to ask to buy it for parts and I have shared all and any information I have for him. Yes the truck does not \u201caffect me\u201d but it takes a good chunk of parking for guests, it\u2019s rotting & looks gross. There is no sentimental attachment it is pure laziness.

No, don\u2019t do it.", "NTA, tow it to his moms house than see how quickly it gets junked, fixed or sold.", "Soft NTA- calling him a POS wasn't nice and the reaction is probably why he is upset. \n\nBut it was good you recognized what you could do in this situation. Giving him the option of taking care of it, or you will is a reasonable solution.", "YTA - it's not in anyone's way. It's not in the neighbours way, they clearly don't care. It's only in the way in your mind. Get over yourself.\n\nWhat would happen if he started tossing clothes and shoes you haven't worn in a year?", "NTA for the desire to move it but you shouldn't call him a POS.  Now to get creative - why don't you have someone look at it and get an estimate for repair.  Then approach him and or the MIL and offer to split the cost for repair  as his Xmas present?  If they don't like that option,  tell them you'll be happy to post it as is for sale and take a commission for you doing the work?  Either way - I know you are frustrated but you should apologize for calling him a POS.", "If it is his mothers then get it towed to her property.", "YTA.

Have it towed to your MIL\u2019s house.", "Honestly, YTA here.\n\nYour husband and his mom should be doing more to get rid of the truck, because they're taking up a surplus parking space and losing resale value sitting on it. But that doesn't really make them assholes; they aren't breaking some social convention or acting immorally by not prioritizing this.\n\nAs far as what you're doing, though, calling him a lazy POS and threatening to have the truck towed because... I dunno, you haven't really given a reason? is over the top. If not selling the truck was causing financial issues or preventing y'all from parking or even causing HOA issues then yeah, it'd be justified to push hard on it, but going straight to (effectively) scrapping the truck as a threat is unnecessary if you just don't like that it isn't sold yet.", "I'm going with YTA as this seems to be a *you* problem. You are frustrated he's not accomplished anything but have you actually tried to help or just complained about it? Who actually owns the vehicle? Have you sat down with both spouse and their mother to discuss the issue? Your spouse isn't seeming to be bothered by the truck while you are - you are not on the same page and name calling or threats aren't going to get you there.", "Soft NTA. But communication is key so I\u2019m leaning ESH. \n\nHave you offered to help him figure this out? Obviously it\u2019s not your responsibility. But perhaps going at it in a civil manner may help. People feel antagonized when called out on their BS. Does that excuse them lashing out at you? Nope. Should you go to these lengths? Probably not. Ultimatums are not the best. Speak to his mother? You\u2019re family. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you can even call for his car to be towed if he is also a property owner of the home?", "YTA if you don't explicitly need the additional parking.  If he didn't change it to non op most states are gonna gouge you in fees though and will ticket and tow if it is on street.", "YTA for the threats and the name-calling.  N T A for being pissed off and THINKING he's a lazy POS.", "eh... it's clearly a priority for you but not for him, and there doesn't seem to be any concrete reason why it is problem other than you don't like it there. On the other hand, I don't really think you're wrong to want it gone, but towing it won't accomplish anything except cost everyone involved more money. I think it's clear that both him and his mom still think of it as his truck, so for all intents and purposes it is. \n\nESH", "YTA calm the fk down. That wasn't a constructive way to deal with a problem. What's your problem with it being parked outside?", "Info; why not try to sell the truck yourself instead of towing it?", "ESH.  Both of you are being unreasonable.\n\nThe root problem here is that the truck is in your MIL's name, but she \"gave\" it to your husband.  Neither of them is clear on who owns it.  Husband doesn't want to make the effort to sell it when MIL won't name a price or even say whether she wants part of the proceeds.  It currently isn't costing anyone anything to store it, so there's no rush.\n\nYes, your husband should have taken care of the truck a long time ago. No, that does not make it right for you to \"threaten\" to take unilateral action.\n\nMy suggestion:  Decorate it with outdoor Christmas lights.  Put a sleigh and reindeer on the hood and roof.  /s", "Have it taken to a storage facility and have him pay $50 a month until him and his mom can decide what to do with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not a problem they created.\n\nIt may be their financial liability if there are municipal laws against having disabled vehicles in public view. Even if that's not the case, and even if they don't need the parking, asking that busted car be removed from the property is not unreasonable, in any situation. Disabled vehicles can rust and be damaged further, leading to leaks that can be personal injury and environmental hazards. \n\nCould they have handled this situation better? Probably.

I bring it up here and there, express my feelings on it again, and then drop the subject because it makes no material difference to me either way!

He should be able to tell you what is actually the goal.\n\nThat all said, it will be a grand mess if you have it towed, regardless of what would happen otherwise.
