My son said that if we gave him the money that me and my husband could just slowly put the money back over the next couple of years. I told him that me and my husband doing that would put us in financial strain. We aren\u2019t struggling by any means but the amount of money set aside for my daughter is too much to just \u201cput back\u201d. \n\nHe and his wife accused me of favoring my daughter.

That still would not be an even trade, but it\u2019s still your money to do as you choose.\n\nHonestly, to me, the last paragraph it sounds like you are punishing your son for trying to live his life and not staying home with you. Also, how was your son supposed to know he had an option of you guys saving money for him if you did not tell him?\n\nYour son is not entitled to any of your money. But let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s your money that you are choosing to put in a savings account for your daughter.

Which is essentially what it would be if you just hand over all the money your daughter paid for rent, then have to pay it back to her. Which you would, because if she sees you give big brother $X0,000 for a house down-payment gift, she is going to expect the same if you're keeping things fair. \n\nLesson learned here, though. There was no reason your son needed to know the financials behind that money being saved, especially when your daughter doesn't even know the savings exist. \n\nMaybe you could inform her of the funds existing and suggest she look for a suitable condo or small house for herself.  She might appreciate that if she knows it's an option.", "NTA because the money is yours, not your daughter\u2018s and you have the right to spend it however you want.  She is paying you rent.

Right now it isn't. Also, as per the post, her motivation was not saving money, she simply wasn't \"ready\" to live on her own. Honestly her still living there now 7 years later (apparently still not because of money) and OP saying the world's to dangerous to live alone as a 29!!! year old grown ass woman, i get the feeling she pretty much gets coddled living at home (which may also be a reason why she still lives there). In most cases I don't think that this situation is really healthy, detaching yourself from your parents is an immensely important part of growing up. \nThat being said, I think ESH. I get why the son feels like you are favouring his sister. That doesn't make it his money tho, as it is completely your decision what happens with it. As for your OP, I think it would've been better to find a way to benefit both your children.", "NTA but I can see why he believes you favor your daughter. She sounds like she\u2019s insecure or childish for living at home this long. Generally kids want to live on their own and you comment of just come home and save is silly as he\u2019s an adult.

You have not been saving money for your son to buy a house. \n\nNta for not giving him all of your savings for your daughter, of course. There's no way he could be entitled to everything you've put aside for her. \n\nBut you may want to consider whether you were the asshole for having this secret arrangement to begin with. When you decided you would help daughter save for a home, why not tell her? Why not tell your son he had the same opportunity available to him, if that was the case? When you say that \"he could have chosen to live with us and save too\", how is that not disingenuous? Of course at 22 he assumed he would pay rent to you, just as your daughter did.  Now he is 31 and has a wife. Saying he can have access to this opportunity to live with you 10 years later than sister did is not quite the same.\n\nChildren do not necessarily deserve and are not entitled to equal amounts of monetary support from parents. Daughter could need or deserve more money from you on a variety of counts, such as her job, her being single, her overall skills or capacities, or her having given up freedoms to live with you or helping you around the house.  But I do believe you should own up to the fact that this is monetary support from you that you are choosing to gift to your daughter. Maybe your idea of what support you could consider providing your son would be different in that case. Or maybe not, if he's an entitled jerk who thinks he deserves all of the saved up money and sister gets an IOU. \n\nBut also...tell the sister she has money to help her buy a house.

Parents are (or will be) essentially making a gift to the daughter in the amount of monthly rent, just because she is living with them. Parents will only give the son the same gift if he lives under parents roof. Seems quite manipulative on the part of the parents.

Frankly, that's a bit of a worry.", "No. That is not fair. \n\nThe son could have had the same arrangement. He could have it now.

Right now they are mad about that. Everyone would need to process their feeling about that before they can move on.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest son and wife are already mad about the situation, they most likely will not be the best house mates right now for anyone.

You're doing it on the condition that you get what you want (your kids comming back home).\n\nI can totally understand why your son (in his 30's) and his wife don't want to move in with their parents/in laws. You said in your post that they're trying to find a house that fits their needs. Are they planning to have kids? What's the plan?
