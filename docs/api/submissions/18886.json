My daughter was nervous about living on her own and after college she asked if she can come back home until she is ready. With the prices of houses right now and how dangerous the world has become, me and my husband decided it was best if she stayed at home. She doesn\u2019t know when she plans on moving out, but she isn\u2019t in any rush and me and my husband don\u2019t plan on rushing her either. She pays us rent once a month. Her only other bills is the stuff for her cat and what she chooses to do on her own time. My husband had the idea to save the money she was giving us as rent and give it all back to her when she\u2019s about to move out as a surprise. My daughter does not know that we have been saving her rent money. \n\nRecently my son (31M) and his wife have been house hunting. They haven\u2019t found anything in there budget that fits their needs. They are short on money and recently found out about what me and my husband have been doing with our daughters rent money. Recently he and his wife sat me and my husband down while our daughter was at work and asked us to give them the money we have been putting aside for our daughter. \n\nI told them no because it wasn\u2019t our money to give away and that it belonged to his sister. He argued that she wasn\u2019t moving out anytime soon and he and his wife needed the money now. I offered to gift him some money but it wasn\u2019t nearly as much as the amount of money my daughters rent money has created over the last 7 years she has been living with us. My son said that if we gave him the money that me and my husband could just slowly put the money back over the next couple of years. I told him that me and my husband doing that would put us in financial strain. We aren\u2019t struggling by any means but the amount of money set aside for my daughter is too much to just \u201cput back\u201d. \n\nHe and his wife accused me of favoring my daughter. I told him that wasn\u2019t true because he had the opportunity to live at home and save up for a house but chose to not live at home after college. I tried my best to explain to them that I couldn\u2019t just give away money that didn\u2019t belong to me.

You/your husband OR your daughter, but never your son.  He seems something that would benefit words and is trying to manipulate the situation and get it.  This is super sad as a parent, but you did the right thing.  Horrible behavior.", "NTA.  Have to wonder how the son found out about the rent money if his sister doesn\u2019t know what your plans are.", "NTA, and no one is allowed to tell you what to do with that money, other than if your daughter refused it and wanted you to have it for your retirement.

Your daughter is 29! She needs to be encouraged to move out on her own. You\u2019re coddling her anxiety instead of helping her to gain the confidence to live independently. The more you enable her, the less likely she is to move forward. What happens when she\u2019s 35 and living at home? 40? 50?\n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to kick her out, but maybe start having a discussion about timelines. Consider helping her get an apartment or at least talk about a timeline for when she might buy a house of her own. Discuss with her the fun things about living independently instead focusing on how \u201cdangerous\u201d the world is. You could even go with her every so often to look at open houses just to see what\u2019s available, talk about what to look for/avoid in a house, etc\u2026. Activities to help her gain confidence and optimism about one day being on her own. \n\nThat aside, I think it\u2019s wonderful and generous that you\u2019ve put her rent aside for her. Your son is acting entitled. You and your husband don\u2019t OWE any adult children money.", "I really can not put a judgement. Because it is your daughter money technically because you are saving it for her.\n\nIn reality you are saving money for your daughter to purchase a house in the future. But not your son.\n\nYour son should be happy for what ever help you guys are willing to give him but at the same time you are saving more for your daughter. \n\nYour daughter is paying you \u201crent\u201d. If she wasn\u2019t living with you guys, she would not be getting that money back. It\u2019s your money to do so as you choose, and you are choosing to save it for your daughter. If you take the money and choose to give it to your son, your daughter isn\u2019t giving your son money, nor is it coming from your daughter saving account (well yes but that\u2019s just because of how you labeled the account) you chose to gave your son some money from your income (rent is income). That still would not be an even trade, but it\u2019s still your money to do as you choose.\n\nHonestly, to me, the last paragraph it sounds like you are punishing your son for trying to live his life and not staying home with you. Also, how was your son supposed to know he had an option of you guys saving money for him if you did not tell him?\n\nYour son is not entitled to any of your money. But let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s your money that you are choosing to put in a savings account for your daughter. I think it would be a little different if your did not charge your daughter rent at all, and  she was the one saving the money up. But with you being in control of the savings account and putting her \u201crent\u201d money in there. You are saving money for your daughter and not your son", "Wait - no - that money is YOURS and you can choose to use it for whatever you want.   \n\n\nAnd why is your daughter more important than your son? If you hand over all or even just part of that money, your daughter will still be paying rent, and you can save up for her again.  \n\n\nI'm not sure but you might be TA.", "NTA, but you are absolutely favoring your daughter and your son having upset feelings is justified.

They basically can't afford to financially help that much, what they can do is let the kids live rent-free so they can save their own money. But they were sensible when their daughter moved back in as a young adult and pretended to charge her rent to help her learn how to budget and keep up with her financial obligations. They have put that money away to give back to her as it's not money they wanted to take from her aside from teaching her those valuable life lessons. The son didn't want to accept their support of a free room (fair enough) but expects them to make it up with a financial gift that they simply can't afford.", "That if they give money to their daughter but not their son, that is certainly favoritism. Simply having he right doesn't mean you aren't an asshole. Favoring one child over another is being an asshole.", "It aint favoritism if he was presented with the same opportunity as the daughter all those years ago"]}
