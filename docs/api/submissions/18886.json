Your daughter is 29! She needs to be encouraged to move out on her own. You\u2019re coddling her anxiety instead of helping her to gain the confidence to live independently. The more you enable her, the less likely she is to move forward. What happens when she\u2019s 35 and living at home? 40? 50?\n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to kick her out, but maybe start having a discussion about timelines. Consider helping her get an apartment or at least talk about a timeline for when she might buy a house of her own. Discuss with her the fun things about living independently instead focusing on how \u201cdangerous\u201d the world is. You could even go with her every so often to look at open houses just to see what\u2019s available, talk about what to look for/avoid in a house, etc\u2026. Activities to help her gain confidence and optimism about one day being on her own. \n\nThat aside, I think it\u2019s wonderful and generous that you\u2019ve put her rent aside for her.

That still would not be an even trade, but it\u2019s still your money to do as you choose.\n\nHonestly, to me, the last paragraph it sounds like you are punishing your son for trying to live his life and not staying home with you. Also, how was your son supposed to know he had an option of you guys saving money for him if you did not tell him?\n\nYour son is not entitled to any of your money. But let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s your money that you are choosing to put in a savings account for your daughter. I think it would be a little different if your did not charge your daughter rent at all, and  she was the one saving the money up.

There was no reason your son needed to know the financials behind that money being saved, especially when your daughter doesn't even know the savings exist. \n\nMaybe you could inform her of the funds existing and suggest she look for a suitable condo or small house for herself.

Honestly her still living there now 7 years later (apparently still not because of money) and OP saying the world's to dangerous to live alone as a 29!!! year old grown ass woman, i get the feeling she pretty much gets coddled living at home (which may also be a reason why she still lives there). In most cases I don't think that this situation is really healthy, detaching yourself from your parents is an immensely important part of growing up. \nThat being said, I think ESH.

When you decided you would help daughter save for a home, why not tell her? Why not tell your son he had the same opportunity available to him, if that was the case? When you say that \"he could have chosen to live with us and save too\", how is that not disingenuous? Of course at 22 he assumed he would pay rent to you, just as your daughter did.

But I do believe you should own up to the fact that this is monetary support from you that you are choosing to gift to your daughter.

Daughter, mom and dad decided daughter is going to pay rent like she would do as a tenant in any other situation.\n\nMom and dad takes rent which is now their income from the space they are renting out to their daughter. They can do whatever they pleases with said money, like all landlords. Mom and Dad chooses to put money away for daughter into a savings account for daughter.

And yes he can move in now since parents are now giving him the option. But he just found out his parents has been saving money for his sister.\n\nAgain it would be different if daughter was living for free and she was putting the money up ( are parents conditions of living for free was to put money up) but it\u2019s not.

Belatedly offering him the same deal when he's 31, has a wife, and is looking for a house to buy isn't really equitable given the limited info we have. But maybe it would be, depending on other factors.  \n\nWhile kids are not entitled to help from their parents like this, nor are equal amounts of money necessarily equitable amounts, there are situations where parents clearly do favor or give more opportunities to one kid over another, and that could definitely be an a h move depending on the circumstances", "That doesn't quite work.  They wanted to do this as a surprise for their daughter.  If it wasn't a surprise, there really isn't a need to charge her rent at all because then she could just be saving that money herself.

Sure it works out about the same in the end but the optics do give off that the daughter is reviving a gift of a lump sum of money from the parents for living at home meanwhile he has missed out on the opportunity for 7 years of rent rebate because he went out and lived a life after college.

So any other bills that they would have to pay would be bills such as phone or car or any other things that they want / need.

Perhaps he is saving because of slightly below market rate rent, shared space or food or utilities...which is a different calculus.

All of my replies has been from exactly what OOP as said and replying to you. \n\nYour second paragraph has legit been what I\u2019ve been saying this whole time so why are we arguing.

I just gave a different example.Again, you are assuming and bringing up things that we do not know is fact or not. So I going to give you a different example. For all we know the son has Mr. independent this whole time, and it\u2019s not an act. The son and wife has been able to keep their jobs pay their rent, bills and live fine. They can probably still do that but instead wants to stop renting from others and buy their own home\u2026 idk where they live but I\u2019m pretty sure the housing market is crap\u2026 where I live the same house that was 250k 3years ago is now 400k with  no new renovations done to it. Interest rates are high and you need 3% down with 3% closing cost. The houses in their budget may not be move in ready and probably will need some repairs. So of course he is going to as his parents for help if they need it. Just because your independent doesn\u2019t mean you would not need help..\n\n\nAlso how do you know he hasn\u2019t been apart of the family? For all we know he going to family dinner once a week. Calls 2 other times during the week. Every other holiday. He just chooses to live with his wife instead of his parents and not afraid to be out in the world (because if we can assume things about the daughter we can assume things about the son).\n\nI said it many times yes he is entitled and should not be asking for the full money. But I do think asking for half is reasonable. And feeling slightly that his parents saved money for his sister and not him ( read previous comments for more explanation)\n\nThe way you are adding facts and assumptions makes this seems personal for you. I hope you were able to get it all out here", "Exactly! My mom is an Italian immigrant. I lived with her until I was 26, now she lives with my husband and I because she got sick and couldn\u2019t live on her own. I am thrilled to raise my daughter in a multigenerational home. If my grandma was willing, I\u2019d move her in too! It\u2019s called being a family. The individualism in this sub is astounding!", "Didn't say that, just said this whole charging one kid fake rent for 7 years and not telling either kid about it suggests they weren't really given the same opportunity. It just makes more sense to have been upfront at the start.\n\nI'm responding to \"this changes everything, he was offered the SAME deal!\" Well, no, I don't think he was.", "Son is insisting on them handing over the money his sister paid. That's some serious entitlement. \n\nSounds like if they could swing it, they would just give their son the money he needs, but they can't financially do it.  \n\nSometimes you think of things in the moment, like their dad just putting the money aside that daughters has paid them. \n\nIn this sense, not one single cent comes out of the parents' wallet.", "\"Sometimes you think of things in the moment, like their dad just putting the money aside that daughters has paid them.\"\n\nThey've been doing this for 7 years, though, since daughter was 22 and son 24. There was plenty of time to be like, hey son, we are letting your sis live here for free and you could too. The fact that they were charging sister rent, even fake rent, and then spontaneously decided to save it, suggests to me they told son he'd owe them rent if he moved back home after college. I just think it would have been most fair to have clear expectations around financial help like that for both kids, all other things being equal, which is usually not the case but the post sure makes it sound like it", "Uhhhh no?? Daughter lives at home, same exact deal was offered to the son who didn\u2019t want it. \n\nThey\u2019re not favoring anyone. In fact it would be favoring the SON if they gave him any of the money."]}
