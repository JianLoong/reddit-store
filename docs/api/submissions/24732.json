Your SIL sounds like a woman who sees other females as competition. If your brothers wife can send out an invitation with an insult, she should't be surprised when people are fed up with her behavior.

She must not be used to pushback.", "Is soft ESH a thing? SIL sounds extremely difficult. Should you have told them you hope they get divorced?

Just a *bit* mind you. A polite RSVP declining the invitation would have sufficed.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming baby!

I would have do it in a heart beat.  Then go NC--which I sincerely hope you are going to do now.  It was probably a bit low to wish her divorce, but seriously she deserved it.  Still not right, but excusable.", "The text was childish but isn't the most important part of the story. You probably do hope she gets divorced so she will just go away, that's understandable.

I hope they get divorced too.", "Hmm, kind of an AH move to hope someone gets divorced, but SIL is a massive one too, so it feels justified. \n\nESH", "NTA \n\nSIL FAFO.", "NTA but it was unnecessary and a bit low, you \"sunk to her level\" as they say. Could have just declined the invitation and left it at that", "Nta. Your SIL sounds like someone who'd throw stones at a beehive, then cry when she gets stung.", "NTA. I also hope they get divorced.", "JAM.  That\u2019s pretty brutal, but they 100% deserve it.", "The invitation came in less than one month before the wedding? Is this a real story?", "hahahaha I love what you said to SIL. She is the dirtbag, not you. Enjoy your SIL free life. Let the fam decide who they want to support.

You should have said you weren't going and left it at that.", "Personally, I would send a digitalis copy of the invitation & added note to everyone who has given you grief.  I would also make a large digital copy and frame it.  Then being it to the next family get together and hand it to that b**ch, congratulate the happy couple, and then walk out.

In fact put it on a billboard", "Was the text really an AH move? I don't think so. Odds are they will get divorced.", "You were NTA at all but the text was not needed. The we won't be attending would have been more than enough and left no one w a word to say.

SIL being an AH is a personality flaw, not a situation.", "I\u2019m sorry for not clearing this up, since we didn\u2019t have a good history, they were not inviting us.

Also, they should text it to every person that makes a rude comment."]}
