It's not clear that you understand why your sister puts up with this bozo, but it's not your business to try to fix it. Plus, you didn't fix it. You made it worse. She warned you that it wouldn't work because of \"how he is,\" and sure enough, she was right about her own husband.", "YTA.  This is Alex's and your sister's marriage, not yours.  No matter how much you think she's making a mistake, she is entitled to choose who she wants in her home, and when.\n\ne:  How did your sister react when her husband told her you'd tried to uninvite him?", "YTA\n\nIt's not your house. If you don't like that her husband will be there, either get new accommodations or reschedule your trip.", "YTA.  Right now. I just don\u2019t know enough to say anything else.  They are married. It is your sisters house she is the only one to decide who can and cannot be there.  Honestly I don\u2019t trust your evaluation of the situation. I don\u2019t know the specifics of their marriage, why hasn\u2019t your sister said anything Or divorces him. Basically it\u2019s all not your concern. You had no business telling him not to come. To your sisters house.", "YTA\n\nlmfao, you text your brother in law and \"asked him\" not to come home...... Yeah, you're an ah. If the dude doesn't live in the same country as his wife and she's not happy, it's time for her to step up and divorce him. Until then, he's her husband and he has every right to come home at any time whether you like it or not.", "Info: why is she married to someone who she sees twice a year? Who\u2019s house is it?", "YTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your business. Stay out of their business.", "YTA. You're making her situation worse. If she refuses to cut off contact or end the marriage that's on her.", "YTA. Your sister's marriage sounds weird as hell, but if that is his house (meaning, he pays for it, or is his in part) and she is his wife (regardless of how strange their marriage is) you don't have any authority to tell him to not go to his house. But the most worrisome part is that you seem to imply that your sister is scared of him. If that is true, you might have made your sister life worse only because you were selfish. Try to convince your sister to leave him or at least offer her support in any case, but to antagonize the man your sister seems afraid of is never a good move, because you go, but she stays and can suffer for your acts.", "YTA\n\nThis was your sister\u2019s call, however much you may have disagreed with it. You should have rescheduled your visit or stayed elsewhere.", "What makes you think you have any right to dictate this?  Your sister already refused you and you go behind her back?  YTA", "YTA. It should have been the end of it when you asked your sister to get him to reschedule. She didn't want to, so you decided to ignore her and make the situation worse. Either you go when he's there and hold your tongue, or you reschedule to see your sister another time.", "YTA, she knew there would be consequences if she asked so she didn\u2019t. You asked and look, there are consequences!!! And you aren\u2019t even the one receiving them. You should have just rescheduled your visit.", "Hate to say this but yta. As you mentioned it's \"his\" house and you caused unnecessary stress on your sister that is in an unfortunate situation.\n\nInfo: who actually owns the home?", "Yta whatever you think of their relationship, you don't get to dictate when he visits or not.", "Boy are YTA you knew this would happen but you texted him anyway. She told you she would ask him to reschedule but you went behind her back anyway.", "YTA \n\nBased on another comment your sister and by extension you, are trying to use the husband. Stupid games stupid prizes", "YTA. This is your sister's house so it was her decision and she was OK with him coming.", "YTA  \nIt's not your choice who she has around HER house. You are being a jerk and dictator", "YTA\n\nGiven the way you describe this guy, you really should have known that your interference was only going to make the situation worse. Congrats.", "It must be extremely hard for you, to see your sister with a man like that.\n\nBut YTA.  It's her home and her marriage; if she wants to be a man's doormat, that's her choice to make.\n\nWhat I don't understand, is that you're aware that any comments you make to him make the situation worse for your sister; so why wouldn't you think that would happen when you asked him not to visit his wife?", "YTA. Thats his marital home.  Perhaps you should have decided to come on a different 2 weeks.", "Ya know what? It\u2019s time to leave.\n\nAnd I find it suuuper suspicious that he shows up for his biannual visit while you are there.

You ruined it for everyone. You sound just as bad as he is with your crazy demands.", "YTA\nAt best their relationship is absolutely none of your business. At worst if she's in domestic violence situation or something to that effect where he is treating her poorly your behavior probably has made it much much worse", "I guess YTA in terms of the question?\nBut seriously, this relationship your sister has sounds toxic as F! WTH!", "YTA. You say that he comes to \u201clord it over her\u201d, and yet you think he\u2019ll get respectful and give you space if you ask him not to come while you\u2019re there??\n\nSMH. In what universe wouldn\u2019t someone like that just do what they could to make it worse, knowing that you (and she) didn\u2019t want him there then?", "YTA. But I'm curious as to what is thevdeal between your sister and her husband thst they have this arrangement? Does he has acsecond family or what?", "Yta Why didnt you just change your visit and avoid the whole thing ?", "YTA. \n\n>I knew I would only say something to him that would make my sister\u2019s situation worse ....\n\n\nAnd yet, you texted him and made the situation worse. Not sure why you're asking when you spelled it out.", "YTA.  Stay out of grown folks' business.  They have something going on that they both find satisfying, you don't know and don't need to know the details.", "YTA and you have main character syndrome. Get that fixed. It ain't cute.", "From what OP has said in another comment, OP's sister is still in love and doesn't want to let go of what she has... .AKA she likes her life and doesn't want things to change..... Which sounds a hell of a lot like \"While I don't like being married, the alternative is worse, so I'll just stick with this\".", "I think it comes down to the fact that she's scared about what her life will be like if she finally takes the step to leave him officially and as much as I hate to say this but I think part of her still loves him and wishes he was still the person she thought she was marrying. Officially she uses the fact that she's in the progress of getting her degree and wouldn't be able to survive financially without him so risks loosing her daughter if she files... Even though my parents have told her repeatedly they'll support her if she leaves him.", "Coming from someone who was in a totally different but also very toxic relationship, it is so hard to leave. Especially when you have good memories to hang on to. She deserves better, but this situation might be \u201cok\u201d enough for her. Ultimately, please realize YTA for telling her husband he can\u2019t come home to his own house when he wants; I understand you already took off work but you have zero authority. Your only reasonable options were to continue with your plans to stay there even though he was also there, or reschedule your trip for a different time. I really do hope you can get through to your sister and help her find a path to a more fulfilling life, but ultimately it\u2019s her decision. Just like you can\u2019t force an addict to get clean before they\u2019re ready, you can\u2019t force someone to leave a bad relationship. Just be there for support."]}
