But the most worrisome part is that you seem to imply that your sister is scared of him. If that is true, you might have made your sister life worse only because you were selfish.

Ultimately, please realize YTA for telling her husband he can\u2019t come home to his own house when he wants; I understand you already took off work but you have zero authority. Your only reasonable options were to continue with your plans to stay there even though he was also there, or reschedule your trip for a different time. I really do hope you can get through to your sister and help her find a path to a more fulfilling life, but ultimately it\u2019s her decision.

Going behind your sister's back to tell him to stay away has clearly made the situation worse for her and considering you and her husband are arguing constantly, I would suggest leaving early to relieve some of the stress she is under.

He did come home for thanksgiving but had to leave the same night. \ud83d\udc94\n\nThe thing is i know what i signed on for. Sure he got this job about 4-5 years into us dating but i still married him. I knew what it meant. And while i put a brave face on every single month before he leaves, it tears me up inside when we have to be separated.\n\nI love my husband more than i thought i could ever love someone. If the sister feels the same way, OP is a massive asshole.

This is not a marriage \"on paper\" and it is in fact his home, since they are neither divorced or separated, and the sister accepts the he can come home whenever he wants.

OP's sister obviiusly doesn't want to deal with the consequences of asking her hisband to come st an other time because he seems to be legally allowed to come \"home\" or else it wouldn't be so easy for him to do as he likes. OP just made the situation worse and that's it. OP knows that shtting up wasn't an option so OP knew from tge begining they're an AH wothout selfcontrol.
