I do not think it's fair of you to expect the other children from being with their siblings, they are a part of your family, and that's what you accepted by marrying a partner with children.\n\nYou're allowed to have intimate conversations with a child alone, but planning **family trips** and excluding your other children is **neglect**.", "YTA.  All the kids are part of your family.  Telling them I want my family time without you is hurtful.   \n\nIt will make them feel like they are not really full members of the family. \n\nYou can plan things that are age specific for your younger kids.  Like a trip to a children's museum and they might choose not to go and I would think that is fine as long as you also plan things geared to the older kids and get a sitter for the little ones.   \n\nBottom line is once you got married they all became your children and should be treated equally.", "Sorry... YTA. I absolutely get why you want that... but it's not great I think, when zooming out from you as an individual. You started dating and married a man who already had 3 children, and good on you, you seem to be making the best of a difficult situation and help raise those kids well.\n\nNobody here can dictate what you should be feeling, but making a difference between the two sets of kids just isn't fair to them. And by the way, it's also not fair to \"your own\" kids - maybe now it matters less to them, but to see you making a difference between the two sets when they are a bit older.\n\nYou have a right to time with your husband on your own. Couple time! You know, once that is easier done. And hey, I think its totally fine to ask the older kids to babysit and earn some extra money so you and your husband can go on a date at some point. But going out on actual family events without the older kids will sow resentment, will always let them know on some level that they are different, that you are tolerating them in your house, doing your best, but not really love them or really see them. That may not even be true, but I do think that's what that wish would broadcast to them.\n\nAlso, aren't you spending time with just the younger kids and your husband when they are seeing their mom? I am guessing your husband is working when they are at school, but he could take a morning off once in a while to take you and the little kids on a walk. Those seem normal - but making a big deal of wanting to exclude the other kids from stuff... careful. It seems innocuous and innocent now but it could be a really slippery slope. They are your kids. That's the choice you made when you guys married. It's not their fault they didn't come out of your body.", "YTA.  That is saying that the step children are not your family.", "Why not do stuff with the two youngest while the older ones are in school?  Take a day off work", "YTA. When you married this man those children were part of the package. You're essentially their mother. Congrats on having a harmonious blended family, many people struggle to achieve this. But with that comes your commitment to them. The minute you start trying to give preferential treatment to the children you birthed, you're going to ruin that relationship with the others that has taken years to build. They trust you and they love you, please don't jeopardise that.\n\nWhy not come at this with a different motivation? Why not say to the older ones that you've arranged X playdate or family visit for them because you'd really like to take the little ones to a toddler-specific activity and it's going to be boring for the older ones. But then you also absolutely must also arrange a nice trip for you, hubby and the older ones, doing an older kids activity while the little ones have a babysitter. I cannot stress it enough, if you ever let on to the older children that you have a desire to have 'family time' with only your 'real' kids, that relationship is gone forever, you will never ever be able to fix the hurt that will cause.", "Yta.  You are not a family of 4, you are a family of 7.  Period.  There is no reason to exclude your step kids except to be an asshole.  So is your husband for agreeing to this and not sticking up for his kids.  You marrried a man with children who has primary custody.  Purposely excluding them is petty and nasty.  Yta a million.", "ESH except the kids. Those poor kids. Apparently their mom either doesn\u2019t want them or doesn\u2019t care to see them that often and now you don\u2019t want them around either.

You made the conscious decision to marry someone who had 3 children and to be part of this instant family.  You then added 2 more to the mix.  I understand that 5 kids can be overwhelming at times, but they are ALL your kids - you cannot pick and choose which ones you wish to hang out with.  As you've said, the mother of the 3 oldest is not really in the picture - so what kind of message are you going to send to the 3 oldest if you and your husband cut them out of things because you want to only be with the 2 kids you had?", "YTA.\n\nWith such a large age gap between the oldest and youngest it's incredibly easy to plan an activity that's appropriate for the youngest ones that likely wouldn't appeal to the older ones and vice versa.\n\nThere's no need to create a divide of \"my kids\" vs \"my husband's kids\" - something that is incredibly hurtful and damaging to *your* older children.  Yes, they are your kids now too.\n\nIt sounds like things have gone well up to now - but look out!  You'll soon have 3 teenagers in the house.  If you want to royally mess up them AND your family life, just keep thinking about how your bio kids are more important to you.  You'll be in for quite a wild ride and everyone will lose.", "YTA.\n\nI was expecting you to say that your husband has 50/50 custody but doesn't want to do anything when your bio-kids when your SKs are with their mother. But them only seeing her 4 hours a month is different. You're not a family of 4. You're a family of 7 and you need to accept that. \n\nWhat are SKs supposed to do ? Just disappear and reappear when it's convenient for you to play happy family ?", "YTA, you have five children. Leaving out your stepchildren for outings is cruel and they will notice your treatment of them, and feel like they are less than. How are you planning on explaining it to them? \u201cSee, I want to spend time with only MY kids, you understand don\u2019t you?\u201d Such an AH move.", "YTA Is it at all possible for you to imagine how they would feel being excluded? How heartless of you. Is it their fault they weren\u2019t born to you? Got news for you. They are as human and worthy as the kids you birthed. \n\nYou married a man with kids. You should have thought more carefully before you did. Heartless.", "YTA. Your step kids are your children. You are trying to make two separate families. The oldest are siblings to your youngest.", "YTA\n\nYou say all 7 family members comes as though they are in their thirties. Even the oldest was only 6 when you got with the family. Must have been dating their father prior to that. If you still think of them like that, you're heartless. I am all for blood in some cases but this is not right, it is messed up.\n\nIf you husband agrees with you, he is an even bigger AH than you. You might not be really related to older 3 but he is equally related to all of them.", "Yeah YTA there will be plenty of time with the younger two as the older ones grow up and don\u2019t want to go out with you anymore", "YTA and you won\u2019t have a good relationship with your stepkids very long. Look there\u2019s nothing wrong with individual time with kids but that isn\u2019t what this is. This is a specific divide between your biological and step children. That will be very evident. Made worse by the fact that you are the active mother role in their lives. Look if you wanted a biological family you shouldn\u2019t have married a man with kids. They are with you 100% of the time because they don\u2019t have a good mother and you think this will help anything? \n\n\n\u201cI want some time to imagine my family with only the children I created\u201d is a HORRIBLE look. You married a man with 100% custody of kids from a prior marriage. You don\u2019t get \u2018family\u2019 time with only the kids you created. That\u2019s not what you signed up for. Wake up lady", "YTA.   Your husband was a package deal.  How you would you feel if your husband's next wife felt the same way about your kids?", "NAH. You should plan age-appropriate activities for sub-sets of your large family (and some one-on-one time with individual kids with each adult). It's perfectly reasonable to want to do something with just \"the littles.\" \n\nI wouldn't be framing it as just \"your\" kids, though. (edit: to be clear, I'm not saying you did, just that the older kids might interpret it that way)", "YTA\n\nYou claim to be a mother figure to your three stepchildren yet don't want to spend time with them? That's not very motherly tbh. \nSpending time with them, doing all the stuff mom's do for their kids and then one day just not wanting them around for a few our and just spending time with your bio kids is super fucking hurtful to those kids who have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that their bio parents divorced and their mom can't care for them. This is going to cause resentment and probably more deep rooted issues for the older kids. \n\nAlso you knew exactly what you were getting into when you started dating your now husband 8 years ago and have been a continuous part of his kids life for that time. It's simply unfair to start treating them as inferior to your bio kids", "YTA YTA YTA.  One for each of of those boys. They were there first, you are a family of 7. Period.", "YTA. Def TA. These 3 are your kids as well even they\u2019re not ur biological children. You said yourself that you have been a mother figure for 8 years now. Now imagine you tell your kids that you want to spend some time with their daddy and your biological children. Do you even know how hard its gonna be for them to know that both of you might want to spend less time with you bc they dont have ur DNA??\nThey are only children you cant do that to them.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have married a man with 3 kids if you wanted to be a family of 4 instead of 7. I hope this isn\u2019t your attitude when it comes to his will.", "Are you serious? \n\nIf you wanted 1:1 time with each kid that\u2019s cool. But don\u2019t plan family outings and. Not include the whole family. News flash: those are HIS \u201cbio kids\u201d\n\nWhat kind of man agrees to leave his kids behind? That should worry you. And What exactly are the other kids supposed to do while your kids get preferential treatment? \n\nThis is begging to be a remake of Cinderella. you\u2019re the evil stepmother and your kids are the privileged evil stepsisters.", "YTA...you say you're the mother figure,  but there's obviously a clear boundary in your mind.", "You actually sound awful! As does your husband. I can't believe he would agree to alienate the older 3 kids. If you didn't want to be a family of 7, you shouldn't have married a man with 3 young children then gone on to have 2 more kids!\n\nYTA", "YTA. You, your husband, and your bio kids aren\u2019t it\u2019s own family. Your family unit is SEVEN strong. Why be exclusionary towards half of your children? Those kids don\u2019t deserve that, they deserve to be included and equally prioritized. \n\nThat being said, I know some people are very intentional about bonding & spending time 1 on 1 with each kid individually. If you feel like you\u2019re missing something, maybe that\u2019s it.", "yta\n\nyour a blended family \n\nyou wanting your own family time is wrong\n\nthere his kids your step kids your acting as if they are strangers to you and something you have to look after \n\nat the end of the day they are your bio children's half siblings", ">They see they see their bio-mum every second Saturday for a couple of hours in the afternoon\n\nSo you have a couple of hours every other Saturday to do something with just the 4 of you. That isn't enough?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Enjoy the time with the entire family while they still want to hang out. Pretty soon they won\u2019t think it\u2019s cool to do that.", "Why can't you do things like that while the older children are with their biological mum? This will allow you to do age-appropriate activities with your toddlers while the older children are otherwise occupied.\n\nBefore you know it the older three won't want to spend time with you or their younger siblings. Enjoy them while you can.\n\nGentle YTA.", "YTA\nYou're basically saying that the older three kids are not part of your family. Doesn't matter how you try to justify it, that's what the kids will think. That will change any relationship you have with your stepkids. \n\nIf you want to do activities for toddlers, maybe give the older kids option to join and if they don't want to join, plan something they can do on their own, like going to a cinema and meet with them after the film is over. \n\nAdditionally if you want activities with the two youngest only, you should also plan some activities only for the older children and leave the 2 small with grandparents or a nanny. It's true the children have a pretty big age gap and some activities are pretty age oriented.\n\nHowever it sounds to me like you just want some activities with your \"real\" family. Since all the kids want to join you it's probably not about different ages.", "YTA. You're a family: anything else yells favouritism. Don't make it a drama. Plan something when the step kids are with their bio mum. That way, you get time with the smaller group, and it's a different treatment because of different contexts rather than valuing certain children above others.  Sorted.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nI get that you want to spend time with your husband and your bio kids, but your stepkids live with you full time.  They see you as their mom.  It would hurt them greatly if you went ahead and did this.\n\nI have an idea that might be a compromise.  If you\u2019re dead set on spending time with your husband and bio kids, also set up something fun to do with your husband and your stepkids.  You\u2019ll need a babysitter for the younger two, but that\u2019s money you\u2019ll have to justify spending if this is what you want.", "YTA. You new what you were getting into when you married a man who already had three children. You get a few hours just the 4 of you when the older children are at their mums. If you start excluding the older kids, your relationship with the kids will probably change, and it won't be for the better", "YTA. You don't have two children. You have five children. You knew he had children before you got involved with him and you still chose to become part of their family since they were there before you were. You were free to leave any time you wanted if you did not like being a part of their family, but instead you further complicated your situation by bringing two more children into the scene.", "Yta but you can also do your own things when they're with their mum? You literally get that opportunity every other Saturday? Even if only for a few hours. You could suggest to mum she take them out of the day and then you have longer? If you can't afford it it could be a gift to them all? Some quality time together?", "YTA.", "NTA but making it work without causing friction with your step kids is another matter.  If your step kids are off with their bio mom, that's your opportunity, but that's the only opportunity.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA. I have 4 kids and never felt like I had to take ALL of them with me to EVERYTHING.  Why do your older kids even want to do stuff that toddlers want to do? I\u2019m sure the little ones are bored being taken to a 14 year olds stuff. There is nothing wrong with time spent with some kids some of the time. You even said in a comment that your husband is taking just his older kids on a vacation! Why isn\u2019t everyone commenting on that being wrong to the little ones?", "Going against the grain with a tentative NTA - ***as long as*** any outing with the two younger children is (a) very occasional or during the time the older ones are with their mother and (b) is framed as \"an outing for babies & toddlers\" ***not*** \"bio vs step\" under any circumstances.  \n\nOP should train herself be thinking in those terms too.   I could be tipped into a Y T A vote if OP's \"need\" was to reinforce her own view of \"my little bio family\" & she is getting close to that in her post.  I think she's saved from Y T A because she seems as if she's trying to be a sensible SM.", "NTA, \n\nI do not think it is un reasonable to want time with your husband and your own 2 bio kids. \n\nYour husband agreed to make this happen and it hasn't.\n\nI understand you ftustration.\n\nBefore I get slated, I also understand the yta coments as well, but having step kids is exhausting. I know from experiance.", "NTA but you came to the wrong place to ask this. Stepmothers are hated here no matter what they do. You should go to r/stepparents , my friend got a lot of support there when she was a stepmom.", "Don't tell your older kids that you want to exclude them from some events. Instead, plan some baby activities like may be zoo, or parks, etc. I'm sure older ones don't want to visit these places. But then again, do plan some day for the older kids too. \n\nNTA", "NTA - have you considered getting a sitter and taking your two + husband to an activity for under 5 year olds? That way the 3 don\u2019t feel excluded per se.", "FFS, NTA!!  Yes, she married someone with kids, why, if she is a good step mom, is she getting blasted for wanting time with her little ones, & her Husband?", "NTA.  Go do something fun when they're at their mom's. 5 kids is a lot of work! Kudos to you.", "NTA.  Of course.  \nBut you are going to be bashed relentlessly on this sub simply because you are a stepmother.", "NTA. You are certainly within your rights to do things with the youngest children that the older children would have absolutely no interest in. I'm sure they would be bored as all get out to go to a toddler play place.\n\nExplain that to the older children that you are taking the babies (and they are certainly still infants/toddlers) to a place that is appropriate for them to enjoy themselves. I'm sure they would be in complete agreement. \n\nYou're doing a good job.

Spending time with just your husband and bio-kids? What exactly does that say to the remaining kids?  In fact, what message are you giving to ALL of the kids?\n\nThey are part of the package you married with their dad. YTA", "This is the answer. All the YTA are coming from people without children of varying ages who are focusing on the bio-kid framing here (which I agree isn't healthy). As a parent of several children we go out of our way to plan things with subsets and one on one so they all have something special. NAH but drop the bio-step delineation.", "Calm down. The older kids go on trips with dad while the younger kids are excluded. All op asks for is going to child event for a few hours", ">I have 4 kids and never felt like I had to take ALL of them with me to EVERYTHING\n\nHave you ever organized an outing that would deliberately exclude them? Have you ever gotten angry when the four of them wanted to join? \n\nI'm one of four, there's never been an outing or event in my family that I wasn't welcome to join, my mother never got angry at me joining her and my siblings. That's not normal behaviour for families.", ">but having step kids is exhausting\n\nNobody forced you or OP to marry people with kids, those kids are forced to endure having both of you as parental figures, regardless of what they think or want. \n\n>Your husband agreed to make this happen and it hasn't.\n\nThe husband is being put in an imposible position because OP didn't think through what marrying a man with 4 children was going to be like. Having a four person family is a pipe dream, not reality, and a pipe dream with the potential to fuck up relationship dynamics for years to come. \n\nLike, this woman here is asking a father to exclude his children from family outings and then being shocked he doesn't. Who does that? \n\n>I do not think it is un reasonable to want time with your husband and your own 2 bio kids. \n\nI do, if you consider yourself a parental figure and almost like a mom to them.", "Maybe your hubby should prioritise you and your kids during that time if he won't do it any other time.", "Then your husband needs to make the accommodation to stay home and spend that time at home with you and the two little ones.  \n\nBottom line, each child should get some one on one special time with both you and your husband.  It matters.   It\u2019ll make them feel important.  And you and your husband need to carve out time for each other.  \n\nBut if you continue it act like there are two family units, then you will be the AH.  You are all of these children\u2019s mother and the only one they can count on.", "This is the only time that would be appropriate. You need to talk to your husband about skipping his activity once a month if you want this to happen.", "Your husband is the AH, he can put aside his hobby and make time for you and the younger 2 children", "So you\u2019d\u2026what\u2026leave the older kids at home while you spent time with the younger kids\u2026?", "Especially considering the age.\n\nI have a stepmom that did this every time my father was away. She'd take my two younger sisters out to movies, get them expensive gifts, eventually she succeeded in making me feel so alienated in my own home that i asked my mom to let me live with her and my stepdad fulltime.", "> I just want to spend time like going to a play center and a toddler science expo with just the four of us\n\nso... what's stopping you from just doing that? it's not like your teen stepchildren would even be interested in going to a toddler science expo, they have much more interesting things to do with their friends.", "And why don't you two go to a play center with the younger two while the older ones visit their bio-mom?", "I would hate to have grown up in an environment where i wasn't taken to the science expo because my father felt like having time away from me, so he could spend time with his \"real children\". That sends a very clear signal.", "It's still strange though. It's going to create a us and them even if you state it in the best way possible.   You will have to accept your step kids and bio kids as one and the same thing.  IF not, you are going to create future conflicts that could have been avoided.  \n\nYou are creating a divide in your family for this I call you TA.", "That still sucks, start working on yourself", "I don\u2019t understand.

Why aren\u2019t you using that time to go to a play center or toddler science expo??\n\nYTA", "Is the issue that you don\u2019t want to include them in activities that wouldn\u2019t interest them or is it that you want to do things with ONLY your bio kids because they are your bio kids? The former is N T A, the latter is YTA", "The fact that you specified which ones are stepchildren and which ones aren't says a lot.\n\nIt is perfectly normal when you have children that are in two separate groups of ages to make separate activities every now and then focused on their interests. This gives you an opportunity to connect with them on their level. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut the way you wrote this made it seem like you only have an interest in doing it with your real children and not doing that with your stepchildren. Even when you talk about your stepchildren you describe your connection as chores. Based on your post you have been their mother figure when the oldest was 6 years old and the youngest was two. \n\nYTA not for wanting to do some exclusive activities with your younger kids, but for making it clear that you favor them over your stepchildren", "I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking for, but why come on here to ask it - in a way that makes it sound like you want to cut them out of vacations - which I don\u2019t think you\u2019re talking about. I would think doing things the younger ones want to do that the older kids wouldn\u2019t be interested in would be great for when the older ones go to their moms house. Or when the older kids are on school - take a day off to go to the little kid stuff.", "There is absolutely nothing wrong with that\u2026.but you came to the wrong place.  This sub mindlessly hates stepmothers in general, so you are not going to get a fair or thoughtful judgement here.  As another user commented, you should go to the r/stepparents sub instead.", "He agreed verbally. From the post, he clearly does not agree. He seems to playing a coward's game of trying to appease her without actually doing what she wants. Probably because on some level he feels guilty about having put her in a situation of being mother to 5 children. That's a LOT. Especially when you have 2 really young kids now that have a lot of needs.\n\nBut yeah, if he can't, this sub is telling her: Please don't make a difference between your 5 kids. They are too young and way too close in age to the younger kids for the mom to be signalling that there is a difference between them.", "He goes on trips with just the older ones while op stays at home with the youngers and she is okay with this. Op just talks about going to a child related event for a few hours.", "She isn\u2019t asking if she\u2019s the asshole for planning age specific activities for the kids.  She\u2019s asking if it\u2019s ok to exclude her step kids.  She doesn\u2019t mention getting a sitter to plan age specific activities for the older kids.  Shes looking for justification to exclude her step kids to play house as a family of 4.", "No that's not all OP asks or she wouldn't be upset at the other kids joining them. She wants an event with only her bio kids and husband, which excludes his bio kids.\n\nEdit: lol, really blocked? Seems I touched a nerve", "Isn\u2019t that exactly what the dad is doing by taking HIS older kids on a vacation? She wants to take the little ones to a toddler expo! What 14 year old wants to do that?! You\u2019re saying she shouldn\u2019t because it excludes the older kids. At some point by not spending one on one time with the younger kids, they are going to feel ignored in favor of what the big kids want to do. She\u2019s not talking about vacations and trips, she\u2019s talking about an afternoon at a science center.", "That\u2019s what she wants to happen.\n\nI don\u2019t think this makes her an AH. Yes - there\u2019s a VERY IMPORTANT LINE that shouldn\u2019t be crossed about excluding step-children.\n\nBut it just sounds like Op wants the little two kids to get some undivided attention from their parents while doing something fun. \n\nIn my large family, my parents would occasionally take one or two or three of us to do something special and age appropriate. Everyone got to do that - so we were happy when it was someone else\u2019s turn.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve seen it happen in families with big age gaps, that the youngest doesn\u2019t get all the fun toddler experiences the older kids got because the parents \u201calready did it\u201d and are too busy to prioritize the littles.\n\nThis seems entirely reasonable. NTA", "She put herself in the position of parenting five kids. She shouldn\u2019t have married a man with kids.", "Hr kids are one and two years old they're not being excluded when not going on a trip. Most one and two year olds don't go on trips, because traveling with babies and toddlers is known to be difficult.\n\nEdit: blocked, how lovely of you.", "Her husband excludes their kids when he goes on vacation with his older kids. But since he isn't a stepparent, that's okay on this sub. And if you read op's comments you'd see that that is all she asks for. She doesn't ask for vacations or entire days without stepkids, she asks for a few hours without them to go to a toddler event. Boy, this sub hates stepmothers", "Nope, her bio kids are one and two years old. It makes sense they're not going on vacations, because traveling with babies and toddlers is awful. \n\n>She wants to take the little ones to a toddler expo!\n\nSpecifically without his bio kids, that's what makes her an asshole..\n\n>What 14 year old wants to do that?!\n\nHer husband's 14 year old, that's who. It doesn't matter if you think it's appropriate, reasonable or normal, the kids want to join they should. \n\n>At some point by not spending one on one time with the younger kids, they are going to feel ignored in favor of what the big kids want to do.\n\nWhy would they feel excluded if they're all participants in the family activity?", "Yeah, no according to what she wrote on the post: \"every time an opportunity has come up to spend time with just the four of us, all 7 family members come along.\"", "The point is that dad spends time with them without the younger kids. They could go on vacation all 7, yet he goes by himself with the older kids. And op is the bad one for asking for a few hours to go at a toddler event - which, btw, an older kid wouldn't want to go to in the first place. But then again, she is a stepmother and on this sub nothing is more hated than a stepmother"]}
