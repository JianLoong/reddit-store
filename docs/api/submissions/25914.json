I do not think it's fair of you to expect the other children from being with their siblings, they are a part of your family, and that's what you accepted by marrying a partner with children.\n\nYou're allowed to have intimate conversations with a child alone, but planning **family trips** and excluding your other children is **neglect**.", "YTA.  All the kids are part of your family.  Telling them I want my family time without you is hurtful.   \n\nIt will make them feel like they are not really full members of the family. \n\nYou can plan things that are age specific for your younger kids.  Like a trip to a children's museum and they might choose not to go and I would think that is fine as long as you also plan things geared to the older kids and get a sitter for the little ones.   \n\nBottom line is once you got married they all became your children and should be treated equally.", "Sorry... YTA. I absolutely get why you want that... but it's not great I think, when zooming out from you as an individual. You started dating and married a man who already had 3 children, and good on you, you seem to be making the best of a difficult situation and help raise those kids well.\n\nNobody here can dictate what you should be feeling, but making a difference between the two sets of kids just isn't fair to them. And by the way, it's also not fair to \"your own\" kids - maybe now it matters less to them, but to see you making a difference between the two sets when they are a bit older.\n\nYou have a right to time with your husband on your own. Couple time! You know, once that is easier done. And hey, I think its totally fine to ask the older kids to babysit and earn some extra money so you and your husband can go on a date at some point. But going out on actual family events without the older kids will sow resentment, will always let them know on some level that they are different, that you are tolerating them in your house, doing your best, but not really love them or really see them. That may not even be true, but I do think that's what that wish would broadcast to them.\n\nAlso, aren't you spending time with just the younger kids and your husband when they are seeing their mom? I am guessing your husband is working when they are at school, but he could take a morning off once in a while to take you and the little kids on a walk. Those seem normal - but making a big deal of wanting to exclude the other kids from stuff... careful. It seems innocuous and innocent now but it could be a really slippery slope. They are your kids. That's the choice you made when you guys married. It's not their fault they didn't come out of your body.", "YTA.  That is saying that the step children are not your family.", "Why not do stuff with the two youngest while the older ones are in school?  Take a day off work", "YTA. When you married this man those children were part of the package. You're essentially their mother. Congrats on having a harmonious blended family, many people struggle to achieve this. But with that comes your commitment to them. The minute you start trying to give preferential treatment to the children you birthed, you're going to ruin that relationship with the others that has taken years to build. They trust you and they love you, please don't jeopardise that.\n\nWhy not come at this with a different motivation? Why not say to the older ones that you've arranged X playdate or family visit for them because you'd really like to take the little ones to a toddler-specific activity and it's going to be boring for the older ones. But then you also absolutely must also arrange a nice trip for you, hubby and the older ones, doing an older kids activity while the little ones have a babysitter. I cannot stress it enough, if you ever let on to the older children that you have a desire to have 'family time' with only your 'real' kids, that relationship is gone forever, you will never ever be able to fix the hurt that will cause.", "Yta.  You are not a family of 4, you are a family of 7.  Period.  There is no reason to exclude your step kids except to be an asshole.  So is your husband for agreeing to this and not sticking up for his kids.  You marrried a man with children who has primary custody.  Purposely excluding them is petty and nasty.  Yta a million.", "ESH except the kids. Those poor kids. Apparently their mom either doesn\u2019t want them or doesn\u2019t care to see them that often and now you don\u2019t want them around either.

You made the conscious decision to marry someone who had 3 children and to be part of this instant family.  You then added 2 more to the mix.  I understand that 5 kids can be overwhelming at times, but they are ALL your kids - you cannot pick and choose which ones you wish to hang out with.  As you've said, the mother of the 3 oldest is not really in the picture - so what kind of message are you going to send to the 3 oldest if you and your husband cut them out of things because you want to only be with the 2 kids you had?", "YTA.\n\nWith such a large age gap between the oldest and youngest it's incredibly easy to plan an activity that's appropriate for the youngest ones that likely wouldn't appeal to the older ones and vice versa.\n\nThere's no need to create a divide of \"my kids\" vs \"my husband's kids\" - something that is incredibly hurtful and damaging to *your* older children.  Yes, they are your kids now too.\n\nIt sounds like things have gone well up to now - but look out!  You'll soon have 3 teenagers in the house.  If you want to royally mess up them AND your family life, just keep thinking about how your bio kids are more important to you.  You'll be in for quite a wild ride and everyone will lose.", "YTA.\n\nI was expecting you to say that your husband has 50/50 custody but doesn't want to do anything when your bio-kids when your SKs are with their mother. But them only seeing her 4 hours a month is different. You're not a family of 4. You're a family of 7 and you need to accept that. \n\nWhat are SKs supposed to do ? Just disappear and reappear when it's convenient for you to play happy family ?", "YTA, you have five children. Leaving out your stepchildren for outings is cruel and they will notice your treatment of them, and feel like they are less than. How are you planning on explaining it to them? \u201cSee, I want to spend time with only MY kids, you understand don\u2019t you?\u201d Such an AH move.", "YTA Is it at all possible for you to imagine how they would feel being excluded? How heartless of you. Is it their fault they weren\u2019t born to you? Got news for you. They are as human and worthy as the kids you birthed. \n\nYou married a man with kids. You should have thought more carefully before you did. Heartless.", "YTA. Your step kids are your children. You are trying to make two separate families. The oldest are siblings to your youngest.", "YTA\n\nYou say all 7 family members comes as though they are in their thirties. Even the oldest was only 6 when you got with the family. Must have been dating their father prior to that. If you still think of them like that, you're heartless. I am all for blood in some cases but this is not right, it is messed up.\n\nIf you husband agrees with you, he is an even bigger AH than you. You might not be really related to older 3 but he is equally related to all of them.", "Yeah YTA there will be plenty of time with the younger two as the older ones grow up and don\u2019t want to go out with you anymore", "YTA and you won\u2019t have a good relationship with your stepkids very long. Look there\u2019s nothing wrong with individual time with kids but that isn\u2019t what this is. This is a specific divide between your biological and step children. That will be very evident. Made worse by the fact that you are the active mother role in their lives. Look if you wanted a biological family you shouldn\u2019t have married a man with kids. They are with you 100% of the time because they don\u2019t have a good mother and you think this will help anything? \n\n\n\u201cI want some time to imagine my family with only the children I created\u201d is a HORRIBLE look. You married a man with 100% custody of kids from a prior marriage. You don\u2019t get \u2018family\u2019 time with only the kids you created. That\u2019s not what you signed up for. Wake up lady", "YTA.   Your husband was a package deal.  How you would you feel if your husband's next wife felt the same way about your kids?", "NAH. You should plan age-appropriate activities for sub-sets of your large family (and some one-on-one time with individual kids with each adult). It's perfectly reasonable to want to do something with just \"the littles.\" \n\nI wouldn't be framing it as just \"your\" kids, though. (edit: to be clear, I'm not saying you did, just that the older kids might interpret it that way)", "YTA\n\nYou claim to be a mother figure to your three stepchildren yet don't want to spend time with them? That's not very motherly tbh. \nSpending time with them, doing all the stuff mom's do for their kids and then one day just not wanting them around for a few our and just spending time with your bio kids is super fucking hurtful to those kids who have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that their bio parents divorced and their mom can't care for them. This is going to cause resentment and probably more deep rooted issues for the older kids. \n\nAlso you knew exactly what you were getting into when you started dating your now husband 8 years ago and have been a continuous part of his kids life for that time. It's simply unfair to start treating them as inferior to your bio kids", "YTA YTA YTA.  One for each of of those boys. They were there first, you are a family of 7. Period.", "YTA. Def TA. These 3 are your kids as well even they\u2019re not ur biological children. You said yourself that you have been a mother figure for 8 years now. Now imagine you tell your kids that you want to spend some time with their daddy and your biological children. Do you even know how hard its gonna be for them to know that both of you might want to spend less time with you bc they dont have ur DNA??\nThey are only children you cant do that to them.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have married a man with 3 kids if you wanted to be a family of 4 instead of 7. I hope this isn\u2019t your attitude when it comes to his will.", "Are you serious? \n\nIf you wanted 1:1 time with each kid that\u2019s cool. But don\u2019t plan family outings and. Not include the whole family. News flash: those are HIS \u201cbio kids\u201d\n\nWhat kind of man agrees to leave his kids behind? That should worry you. And What exactly are the other kids supposed to do while your kids get preferential treatment? \n\nThis is begging to be a remake of Cinderella. you\u2019re the evil stepmother and your kids are the privileged evil stepsisters.", "YTA...you say you're the mother figure,  but there's obviously a clear boundary in your mind.", "You actually sound awful! As does your husband. I can't believe he would agree to alienate the older 3 kids. If you didn't want to be a family of 7, you shouldn't have married a man with 3 young children then gone on to have 2 more kids!\n\nYTA", "YTA. You, your husband, and your bio kids aren\u2019t it\u2019s own family. Your family unit is SEVEN strong. Why be exclusionary towards half of your children? Those kids don\u2019t deserve that, they deserve to be included and equally prioritized. \n\nThat being said, I know some people are very intentional about bonding & spending time 1 on 1 with each kid individually. If you feel like you\u2019re missing something, maybe that\u2019s it.", "yta\n\nyour a blended family \n\nyou wanting your own family time is wrong\n\nthere his kids your step kids your acting as if they are strangers to you and something you have to look after \n\nat the end of the day they are your bio children's half siblings", ">They see they see their bio-mum every second Saturday for a couple of hours in the afternoon\n\nSo you have a couple of hours every other Saturday to do something with just the 4 of you. That isn't enough?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Enjoy the time with the entire family while they still want to hang out. Pretty soon they won\u2019t think it\u2019s cool to do that.", "Why can't you do things like that while the older children are with their biological mum? This will allow you to do age-appropriate activities with your toddlers while the older children are otherwise occupied.\n\nBefore you know it the older three won't want to spend time with you or their younger siblings. Enjoy them while you can.\n\nGentle YTA.", "YTA\nYou're basically saying that the older three kids are not part of your family. Doesn't matter how you try to justify it, that's what the kids will think. That will change any relationship you have with your stepkids. \n\nIf you want to do activities for toddlers, maybe give the older kids option to join and if they don't want to join, plan something they can do on their own, like going to a cinema and meet with them after the film is over. \n\nAdditionally if you want activities with the two youngest only, you should also plan some activities only for the older children and leave the 2 small with grandparents or a nanny. It's true the children have a pretty big age gap and some activities are pretty age oriented.\n\nHowever it sounds to me like you just want some activities with your \"real\" family. Since all the kids want to join you it's probably not about different ages.", "YTA. You're a family: anything else yells favouritism. Don't make it a drama. Plan something when the step kids are with their bio mum. That way, you get time with the smaller group, and it's a different treatment because of different contexts rather than valuing certain children above others.  Sorted.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nI get that you want to spend time with your husband and your bio kids, but your stepkids live with you full time.  They see you as their mom.  It would hurt them greatly if you went ahead and did this.\n\nI have an idea that might be a compromise.  If you\u2019re dead set on spending time with your husband and bio kids, also set up something fun to do with your husband and your stepkids.  You\u2019ll need a babysitter for the younger two, but that\u2019s money you\u2019ll have to justify spending if this is what you want.", "YTA. You new what you were getting into when you married a man who already had three children. You get a few hours just the 4 of you when the older children are at their mums. If you start excluding the older kids, your relationship with the kids will probably change, and it won't be for the better", "YTA. You don't have two children. You have five children. You knew he had children before you got involved with him and you still chose to become part of their family since they were there before you were. You were free to leave any time you wanted if you did not like being a part of their family, but instead you further complicated your situation by bringing two more children into the scene.", "Yta but you can also do your own things when they're with their mum? You literally get that opportunity every other Saturday? Even if only for a few hours. You could suggest to mum she take them out of the day and then you have longer? If she can't afford it it could be a gift to them all? Some quality time together?", "YTA.", "NTA but making it work without causing friction with your step kids is another matter.  If your step kids are off with their bio mom, that's your opportunity, but that's the only opportunity.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA. I have 4 kids and never felt like I had to take ALL of them with me to EVERYTHING.  Why do your older kids even want to do stuff that toddlers want to do? I\u2019m sure the little ones are bored being taken to a 14 year olds stuff. There is nothing wrong with time spent with some kids some of the time. You even said in a comment that your husband is taking just his older kids on a vacation! Why isn\u2019t everyone commenting on that being wrong to the little ones?", "Going against the grain with a tentative NTA - ***as long as*** any outing with the two younger children is (a) very occasional or during the time the older ones are with their mother and (b) is framed as \"an outing for babies & toddlers\" ***not*** \"bio vs step\" under any circumstances.  \n\nOP should train herself be thinking in those terms too.   I could be tipped into a Y T A vote if OP's \"need\" was to reinforce her own view of \"my little bio family\" & she is getting close to that in her post.  I think she's saved from Y T A because she seems as if she's trying to be a sensible SM.", "NTA, \n\nI do not think it is un reasonable to want time with your husband and your own 2 bio kids. \n\nYour husband agreed to make this happen and it hasn't.\n\nI understand you ftustration.\n\nBefore I get slated, I also understand the yta coments as well, but having step kids is exhausting. I know from experiance.", "NTA but you came to the wrong place to ask this. Stepmothers are hated here no matter what they do. You should go to r/stepparents , my friend got a lot of support there when she was a stepmom.", "Don't tell your older kids that you want to exclude them from some events. Instead, plan some baby activities like may be zoo, or parks, etc. I'm sure older ones don't want to visit these places. But then again, do plan some day for the older kids too. \n\nNTA", "NTA - have you considered getting a sitter and taking your two + husband to an activity for under 5 year olds? That way the 3 don\u2019t feel excluded per se.", "FFS, NTA!!  Yes, she married someone with kids, why, if she is a good step mom, is she getting blasted for wanting time with her little ones, & her Husband?", "NTA.  Go do something fun when they're at their mom's. 5 kids is a lot of work! Kudos to you.", "NTA.  Of course.  \nBut you are going to be bashed relentlessly on this sub simply because you are a stepmother.", "NTA. You are certainly within your rights to do things with the youngest children that the older children would have absolutely no interest in. I'm sure they would be bored as all get out to go to a toddler play place.\n\nExplain that to the older children that you are taking the babies (and they are certainly still infants/toddlers) to a place that is appropriate for them to enjoy themselves. I'm sure they would be in complete agreement. \n\nYou're doing a good job.

Then both you and your husband can focus on them.  Could be a movie, go carts, hiking, swimming at a pool or lake, eating out at a more older child/adult focused restaurant, etc.   \n\nThen next would be the outing with the babies focused on something they can do.

All of your oldest kids should really be learning to actually cook (and bake) as part of the family.  Doesn\u2019t have to be fancy cooking or baking.  They could maybe take turns doing a meal one day a week (maybe Saturday or Sunday when less rushed) including making up a list of what\u2019s required, going to do the shopping for what don\u2019t have to learn comparison shopping (ex cheaper/bigger is not always better) and then cook it with guidance.  Tacos, a beef or pork roast, chicken, meatloaf, whatever.  Bonus if they can incorporate the sale items from the week\u2019s grocery ad.   And in cooking they can experiment with spices.  This is SO helpful when they are on their own as way cheaper to cook their own meals than eat out.  \n\nBaking is a little more involved but once they learn the basic concepts whipping up a batch of fresh chocolate chip or other cookies tastes way better.  Also with baking it is more of a science so not quite as laid back as cooking but still allows for some experimentation.

If this was like a true off my chest type of post, I could understand , but OP is telling her husband and kids, even if not directly, that She doesnt see them as her family. Why chose to be in their lifes if just to break their heart like that?", "If it was about the ages she would say that instead of \u201cAITA for wanting to spend time with just MY husband and [MY] two children\u201d.", "The title", "Ya like maybe these are especially awesome kids who want to hang out with their parents and little siblings? Sounds like OP won the lottery with her bonus kids.", "If /u/silver-pincat just wanted to go out with the babies sometime, that would be fine. It\u2019s her specifically dividing them into bio children and stepchildren and saying she wants to spend time with her by her children. That is the problem. I have two biological kids, and sometimes I would take the older one somewhere and sometimes I take the younger one  to make sure they all got one on one time.  She sure could just take the babies somewhere, but she should take just the older kids somewhere just as often. It\u2019s the way that she\u2019s categorize it down as though the step children are separate and less.", "Because they\u2019re older (\u201cthey want to do grown up things with dad\u201d) not because they\u2019re his other kids.", "I always find this argument a bit... you know... useless. Like yes, people make choices. Choices have consequences. But you can't actually make choices in the way your argument suggests, i.e. in full knowledge of what will happen and how you will feel. At like 25 when she started to fall in love with a man with 3 kids, she COULD NOT have forseen what it feels like to become a mother in the physical way, to carry a baby and to know a child from basically before it was born. By the way, I'm guessing you can't either from that post.\n\nSo yeah, of course people make choices. So what? Doesn't mean they don't get into situations that are difficult even if they do not regret those choices, which she clearly doesn't.", "My exact thought! Why can this not happen!?\nMakes the absolute most sense, no alienation, no resentment and everyone gets their way! How has this not crossed her mind?", "But she\u2019s not venting. She\u2019s talking about a specific plan to exclude them", "Exactly and especially since the kids live with them. If she can\u2019t accept the three older ones because they\u2019re not bio then she should have not married him. Dad is also the problem here because he wants to go along with it. They\u2019re both horrible people", "You literally misquoted the title just to continue to push your unsupported biased interpretation.

You are projecting your own biases.", "My oldest wants to be included in all the little kid activities, but he's too big and rough. Especially if he gets bored. I love that some places have a \"Must be under this height to enter\" sign for the toddler zone.", "Right, they\u2019re doing older kid activities because they\u2019re older kids and OP wants to do younger kid activities with the younger kids. What\u2019s the issue?", "Why\u2019d you block them? That seemed like a pretty innocuous comment.", "If you can't see the difference of leaving a 1 and 2 year old at home somewhere because they physically just can't do everything yet, or excluding older children just because they're not bio children, I don't know what to tell you.", "Wanting to spend time with your biological children *just because they\u2019re biological* make you a HUGE asshole.", "Exactly. Double standards.", "Exactly, that why I think she's the AH", "I agree the husband agreeing is a problem. Maybe OP framed it in another way when they talked", "I didn\u2019t misquote the title lol it\u2019s word for word.

It just seems mean to say 'no, you CAN'T come to the toddler science expo with me and dad and your brothers, even if you're only 10 and think it sounds interesting too.'", "The issue? Your literacy and comprehension.", "What about if it's as OP says and she wants to take the toddlers to toddler activities and wants Dad to be there, too? They already do different activities for the different age groups - Dad takes oldest 3 (happen to be the step kids/only his bio) to tween/teen activities and OP takes littles to little activities. When they go out as a family, it's to activities that are for everyone. But from what it sounds, Dad doesn't get activity time where he can focus on the littles. Every so often, it's OK to want to do something just for the youngers that the olders might not like (my parents did this with me and my brother. we're all bio related, but still my brother did not want to go to have a tea party with me when I was 5 so my parents didn't make him.) \n\nWould it be so wrong if, when the older kids are at visitation with their mom or if an aunt/uncle/grandparent took them to a fun tween/teen activity,  OP and dad take toddlers to a kiddie playground or a tots gymnastics class? Heck, if its a petting zoo, maybe 10 would want to come along and the split would be 14 & 12 going to a movie (being allowed to see a movie without parents is super cool at that age) and 10& tots get to go to a petting zoo. \n\nIt's a tough situation and I don't think OP is an AH for wanting Dad to spend time with the littles and be able to focus on them. I think they just have to be more proactive with finding something fun for the olders to do so they don't feel left out.", "Yeah dad is just as bad. Those poor kids. Knowing they are being excluded because they\u2019re not bio kids. That\u2019s awful", "You absolutely misquoted the title. The word \u201cmy\u201d only appears once.", "They\u2019re also the only young children and OP specifically stated she wants to take them to activities aimed at young children. Nowhere is it stated that she wants to \u201cexclude\u201d anyone based on biological relationship.", "Can you quote exactly where she says \u201cmy two children\u201d and excludes the stepchildren? All I see is the opposite, as the opening sentence states \u201cI and my husband have 5 children\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t speak specifically on your biases, but that\u2019s really the only explanation for the baseless inferences you and others are making here.", "The irony of this comment after you just failed to accurately quote the title of the post you\u2019re commenting on", "That's exclusionary of step kids, and it's a shitty disgusting thing to do. I'm sorry your dad and step mom did that to you, but that doesn't mean other kids should be excluded. \n\n>Enjoy your step parent witch hunt!!!\n\nLol I'm sorry so many step parents around here follow the Disney step parents script, luckily the steps I know in real life are loving family members who would never exclude another family member.", "That\u2019s what [] means because \u201cmy\u201d is applied to both [husband and children].\n\n\u201cMy husband and my children\u201d is redundant so English generally drops the second one.
