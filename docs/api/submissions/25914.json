Rebecca, Sam and Dave are my stepchildren (husband's children from his first marriage), and George and Harry are our bio kids. All five children live with us full-time. I have been the three older kids' mother-figure for almost 8 years now, and have a good relationship with them. They see they see their bio-mum every second Saturday for a couple of hours in the afternoon (their choice to see her that much - there are no court orders).  Their mother is unable/unwilling to take care of them on a short or long-term regular basis. \n\nWhen I say that I am a mother-figure to Rebecca, Sam and Dave, I mean I am there for them to listen to issues and normal teen stuff they may want to vent on, I do the cooking, cleaning, clothes washing, etc, and all the general things a mum does in the home. (They are responsible for keeping their own rooms clean). Husband is of course a supportive dad and is there to help them as well.  My husband and I split the cleaning 50/50 pretty much, however, I do 95% of the cooking. The older three do not babysit their younger siblings, I do not think that is fair to ask that of them. \n\nRecently, in addition to spending quality time as a family of 7, I have also been wanting to spend time with just me, my husband, George and Harry. My husband and I discussed this and are both in agreeance that this can happen.  Even though we have discussed this, every time an opportunity has come up to spend time with just the four of us, all 7 family members come along.  I have gone along with this and allowed it to happen on these occassions, but I can feel myself getting frustrated that I have expressed a need and it keeps getting ignored. \n\nJust to clarify, I don't want all events to be just me, my husband, Harry and George, I am only asking for it to happen occassionally.

I do not think it's fair of you to expect the other children from being with their siblings, they are a part of your family, and that's what you accepted by marrying a partner with children.\n\nYou're allowed to have intimate conversations with a child alone, but planning **family trips** and excluding your other children is **neglect**.", "YTA.  All the kids are part of your family.  Telling them I want my family time without you is hurtful.   \n\nIt will make them feel like they are not really full members of the family. \n\nYou can plan things that are age specific for your younger kids.  Like a trip to a children's museum and they might choose not to go and I would think that is fine as long as you also plan things geared to the older kids and get a sitter for the little ones.   \n\nBottom line is once you got married they all became your children and should be treated equally.", "Sorry... YTA. I absolutely get why you want that... but it's not great I think, when zooming out from you as an individual. You started dating and married a man who already had 3 children, and good on you, you seem to be making the best of a difficult situation and help raise those kids well.\n\nNobody here can dictate what you should be feeling, but making a difference between the two sets of kids just isn't fair to them. And by the way, it's also not fair to \"your own\" kids - maybe now it matters less to them, but to see you making a difference between the two sets when they are a bit older.\n\nYou have a right to time with your husband on your own. Couple time! You know, once that is easier done. And hey, I think its totally fine to ask the older kids to babysit and earn some extra money so you and your husband can go on a date at some point. But going out on actual family events without the older kids will sow resentment, will always let them know on some level that they are different, that you are tolerating them in your house, doing your best, but not really love them or really see them. That may not even be true, but I do think that's what that wish would broadcast to them.\n\nAlso, aren't you spending time with just the younger kids and your husband when they are seeing their mom? I am guessing your husband is working when they are at school, but he could take a morning off once in a while to take you and the little kids on a walk. Those seem normal - but making a big deal of wanting to exclude the other kids from stuff... careful. It seems innocuous and innocent now but it could be a really slippery slope. They are your kids. That's the choice you made when you guys married. It's not their fault they didn't come out of your body.", "YTA.  That is saying that the step children are not your family.", "Why not do stuff with the two youngest while the older ones are in school?  Take a day off work", "YTA. When you married this man those children were part of the package. You're essentially their mother. Congrats on having a harmonious blended family, many people struggle to achieve this. But with that comes your commitment to them. The minute you start trying to give preferential treatment to the children you birthed, you're going to ruin that relationship with the others that has taken years to build. They trust you and they love you, please don't jeopardise that.\n\nWhy not come at this with a different motivation? Why not say to the older ones that you've arranged X playdate or family visit for them because you'd really like to take the little ones to a toddler-specific activity and it's going to be boring for the older ones. But then you also absolutely must also arrange a nice trip for you, hubby and the older ones, doing an older kids activity while the little ones have a babysitter. I cannot stress it enough, if you ever let on to the older children that you have a desire to have 'family time' with only your 'real' kids, that relationship is gone forever, you will never ever be able to fix the hurt that will cause.", "Yta.  You are not a family of 4, you are a family of 7.  Period.  There is no reason to exclude your step kids except to be an asshole.  So is your husband for agreeing to this and not sticking up for his kids.  You marrried a man with children who has primary custody.  Purposely excluding them is petty and nasty.  Yta a million.", "ESH except the kids. Those poor kids. Apparently their mom either doesn\u2019t want them or doesn\u2019t care to see them that often and now you don\u2019t want them around either.

You made the conscious decision to marry someone who had 3 children and to be part of this instant family.  You then added 2 more to the mix.  I understand that 5 kids can be overwhelming at times, but they are ALL your kids - you cannot pick and choose which ones you wish to hang out with.  As you've said, the mother of the 3 oldest is not really in the picture - so what kind of message are you going to send to the 3 oldest if you and your husband cut them out of things because you want to only be with the 2 kids you had?", "YTA.\n\nWith such a large age gap between the oldest and youngest it's incredibly easy to plan an activity that's appropriate for the youngest ones that likely wouldn't appeal to the older ones and vice versa.\n\nThere's no need to create a divide of \"my kids\" vs \"my husband's kids\" - something that is incredibly hurtful and damaging to *your* older children.  Yes, they are your kids now too.\n\nIt sounds like things have gone well up to now - but look out!  You'll soon have 3 teenagers in the house.  If you want to royally mess up them AND your family life, just keep thinking about how your bio kids are more important to you.  You'll be in for quite a wild ride and everyone will lose.", "YTA.\n\nI was expecting you to say that your husband has 50/50 custody but doesn't want to do anything when your bio-kids when your SKs are with their mother. But them only seeing her 4 hours a month is different. You're not a family of 4. You're a family of 7 and you need to accept that. \n\nWhat are SKs supposed to do ? Just disappear and reappear when it's convenient for you to play happy family ?", "YTA, you have five children. Leaving out your stepchildren for outings is cruel and they will notice your treatment of them, and feel like they are less than. How are you planning on explaining it to them? \u201cSee, I want to spend time with only MY kids, you understand don\u2019t you?\u201d Such an AH move.", "YTA Is it at all possible for you to imagine how they would feel being excluded? How heartless of you. Is it their fault they weren\u2019t born to you? Got news for you. They are as human and worthy as the kids you birthed. \n\nYou married a man with kids. You should have thought more carefully before you did. Heartless.", "YTA. Your step kids are your children. You are trying to make two separate families. The oldest are siblings to your youngest.", "YTA\n\nYou say all 7 family members comes as though they are in their thirties. Even the oldest was only 6 when you got with the family. Must have been dating their father prior to that. If you still think of them like that, you're heartless. I am all for blood in some cases but this is not right, it is messed up.\n\nIf you husband agrees with you, he is an even bigger AH than you. You might not be really related to older 3 but he is equally related to all of them.", "Yeah YTA there will be plenty of time with the younger two as the older ones grow up and don\u2019t want to go out with you anymore", "YTA and you won\u2019t have a good relationship with your stepkids very long. Look there\u2019s nothing wrong with individual time with kids but that isn\u2019t what this is. This is a specific divide between your biological and step children. That will be very evident. Made worse by the fact that you are the active mother role in their lives. Look if you wanted a biological family you shouldn\u2019t have married a man with kids. They are with you 100% of the time because they don\u2019t have a good mother and you think this will help anything? \n\n\n\u201cI want some time to imagine my family with only the children I created\u201d is a HORRIBLE look. You married a man with 100% custody of kids from a prior marriage. You don\u2019t get \u2018family\u2019 time with only the kids you created. That\u2019s not what you signed up for. Wake up lady", "YTA.   Your husband was a package deal.  How you would you feel if your husband's next wife felt the same way about your kids?", "NAH. You should plan age-appropriate activities for sub-sets of your large family (and some one-on-one time with individual kids with each adult). It's perfectly reasonable to want to do something with just \"the littles.\" \n\nI wouldn't be framing it as just \"your\" kids, though. (edit: to be clear, I'm not saying you did, just that the older kids might interpret it that way)", "YTA\n\nYou claim to be a mother figure to your three stepchildren yet don't want to spend time with them? That's not very motherly tbh. \nSpending time with them, doing all the stuff mom's do for their kids and then one day just not wanting them around for a few our and just spending time with your bio kids is super fucking hurtful to those kids who have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that their bio parents divorced and their mom can't care for them. This is going to cause resentment and probably more deep rooted issues for the older kids. \n\nAlso you knew exactly what you were getting into when you started dating your now husband 8 years ago and have been a continuous part of his kids life for that time. It's simply unfair to start treating them as inferior to your bio kids", "YTA YTA YTA.  One for each of of those boys. They were there first, you are a family of 7. Period.", "YTA. Def TA. These 3 are your kids as well even they\u2019re not ur biological children. You said yourself that you have been a mother figure for 8 years now. Now imagine you tell your kids that you want to spend some time with their daddy and your biological children. Do you even know how hard its gonna be for them to know that both of you might want to spend less time with you bc they dont have ur DNA??\nThey are only children you cant do that to them.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have married a man with 3 kids if you wanted to be a family of 4 instead of 7. I hope this isn\u2019t your attitude when it comes to his will.", "Are you serious? \n\nIf you wanted 1:1 time with each kid that\u2019s cool. But don\u2019t plan family outings and. Not include the whole family. News flash: those are HIS \u201cbio kids\u201d\n\nWhat kind of man agrees to leave his kids behind? That should worry you. And What exactly are the other kids supposed to do while your kids get preferential treatment? \n\nThis is begging to be a remake of Cinderella. you\u2019re the evil stepmother and your kids are the privileged evil stepsisters.", "YTA...you say you're the mother figure,  but there's obviously a clear boundary in your mind.", "You actually sound awful! As does your husband. I can't believe he would agree to alienate the older 3 kids. If you didn't want to be a family of 7, you shouldn't have married a man with 3 young children then gone on to have 2 more kids!\n\nYTA", "YTA. You, your husband, and your bio kids aren\u2019t it\u2019s own family. Your family unit is SEVEN strong. Why be exclusionary towards half of your children? Those kids don\u2019t deserve that, they deserve to be included and equally prioritized. \n\nThat being said, I know some people are very intentional about bonding & spending time 1 on 1 with each kid individually. If you feel like you\u2019re missing something, maybe that\u2019s it.", "yta\n\nyour a blended family \n\nyou wanting your own family time is wrong\n\nthere his kids your step kids your acting as if they are strangers to you and something you have to look after \n\nat the end of the day they are your bio children's half siblings", ">They see they see their bio-mum every second Saturday for a couple of hours in the afternoon\n\nSo you have a couple of hours every other Saturday to do something with just the 4 of you. That isn't enough?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Enjoy the time with the entire family while they still want to hang out. Pretty soon they won\u2019t think it\u2019s cool to do that.", "Why can't you do things like that while the older children are with their biological mum? This will allow you to do age-appropriate activities with your toddlers while the older children are otherwise occupied.\n\nBefore you know it the older three won't want to spend time with you or their younger siblings. Enjoy them while you can.\n\nGentle YTA.", "YTA\nYou're basically saying that the older three kids are not part of your family. Doesn't matter how you try to justify it, that's what the kids will think. That will change any relationship you have with your stepkids. \n\nIf you want to do activities for toddlers, maybe give the older kids option to join and if they don't want to join, plan something they can do on their own, like going to a cinema and meet with them after the film is over. \n\nAdditionally if you want activities with the two youngest only, you should also plan some activities only for the older children and leave the 2 small with grandparents or a nanny. It's true the children have a pretty big age gap and some activities are pretty age oriented.\n\nHowever it sounds to me like you just want some activities with your \"real\" family. Since all the kids want to join you it's probably not about different ages.", "YTA. You're a family: anything else yells favouritism. Don't make it a drama. Plan something when the step kids are with their bio mum. That way, you get time with the smaller group, and it's a different treatment because of different contexts rather than valuing certain children above others.  Sorted.", "Very soft YTA.\n\nI get that you want to spend time with your husband and your bio kids, but your stepkids live with you full time.  They see you as their mom.  It would hurt them greatly if you went ahead and did this.\n\nI have an idea that might be a compromise.  If you\u2019re dead set on spending time with your husband and bio kids, also set up something fun to do with your husband and your stepkids.  You\u2019ll need a babysitter for the younger two, but that\u2019s money you\u2019ll have to justify spending if this is what you want.", "YTA. You new what you were getting into when you married a man who already had three children. You get a few hours just the 4 of you when the older children are at their mums. If you start excluding the older kids, your relationship with the kids will probably change, and it won't be for the better", "YTA. You don't have two children. You have five children. You knew he had children before you got involved with him and you still chose to become part of their family since they were there before you were. You were free to leave any time you wanted if you did not like being a part of their family, but instead you further complicated your situation by bringing two more children into the scene.", "Yta but you can also do your own things when they're with their mum? You literally get that opportunity every other Saturday? Even if only for a few hours. You could suggest to mum she take them out of the day and then you have longer? If she can't afford it it could be a gift to them all? Some quality time together for them too?", "YTA.", "NTA but making it work without causing friction with your step kids is another matter.  If your step kids are off with their bio mom, that's your opportunity, but that's the only opportunity.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA. I have 4 kids and never felt like I had to take ALL of them with me to EVERYTHING.  Why do your older kids even want to do stuff that toddlers want to do? I\u2019m sure the little ones are bored being taken to a 14 year olds stuff. There is nothing wrong with time spent with some kids some of the time. You even said in a comment that your husband is taking just his older kids on a vacation! Why isn\u2019t everyone commenting on that being wrong to the little ones?", "Going against the grain with a tentative NTA - ***as long as*** any outing with the two younger children is (a) very occasional or during the time the older ones are with their mother and (b) is framed as \"an outing for babies & toddlers\" ***not*** \"bio vs step\" under any circumstances.  \n\nOP should train herself be thinking in those terms too.   I could be tipped into a Y T A vote if OP's \"need\" was to reinforce her own view of \"my little bio family\" & she is getting close to that in her post.  I think she's saved from Y T A because she seems as if she's trying to be a sensible SM.", "NTA, \n\nI do not think it is un reasonable to want time with your husband and your own 2 bio kids. \n\nYour husband agreed to make this happen and it hasn't.\n\nI understand you ftustration.\n\nBefore I get slated, I also understand the yta coments as well, but having step kids is exhausting. I know from experiance.", "NTA but you came to the wrong place to ask this. Stepmothers are hated here no matter what they do. You should go to r/stepparents , my friend got a lot of support there when she was a stepmom.", "Don't tell your older kids that you want to exclude them from some events. Instead, plan some baby activities like may be zoo, or parks, etc. I'm sure older ones don't want to visit these places. But then again, do plan some day for the older kids too. \n\nNTA", "NTA - have you considered getting a sitter and taking your two + husband to an activity for under 5 year olds? That way the 3 don\u2019t feel excluded per se.", "FFS, NTA!!  Yes, she married someone with kids, why, if she is a good step mom, is she getting blasted for wanting time with her little ones, & her Husband?", "NTA.  Go do something fun when they're at their mom's. 5 kids is a lot of work! Kudos to you.", "NTA.  Of course.  \nBut you are going to be bashed relentlessly on this sub simply because you are a stepmother.", "NTA. You are certainly within your rights to do things with the youngest children that the older children would have absolutely no interest in. I'm sure they would be bored as all get out to go to a toddler play place.\n\nExplain that to the older children that you are taking the babies (and they are certainly still infants/toddlers) to a place that is appropriate for them to enjoy themselves.

Then both you and your husband can focus on them.  Could be a movie, go carts, hiking, swimming at a pool or lake, eating out at a more older child/adult focused restaurant, etc.   \n\nThen next would be the outing with the babies focused on something they can do.

All of your oldest kids should really be learning to actually cook (and bake) as part of the family.  Doesn\u2019t have to be fancy cooking or baking.  They could maybe take turns doing a meal one day a week (maybe Saturday or Sunday when less rushed) including making up a list of what\u2019s required, going to do the shopping for what don\u2019t have to learn comparison shopping (ex cheaper/bigger is not always better) and then cook it with guidance.  Tacos, a beef or pork roast, chicken, meatloaf, whatever.  Bonus if they can incorporate the sale items from the week\u2019s grocery ad.   And in cooking they can experiment with spices.  This is SO helpful when they are on their own as way cheaper to cook their own meals than eat out.  \n\nBaking is a little more involved but once they learn the basic concepts whipping up a batch of fresh chocolate chip or other cookies tastes way better.  Also with baking it is more of a science so not quite as laid back as cooking but still allows for some experimentation.

Then take the youngers to a little kid thing. Not everyone needs to go to everything all the time, and it can be part of a healthy family dynamic to split up and do age-appropriate stuff sometimes.

Our mom wouldn\u2019t take us because it fell on one of our \u201cdad\u2019s days\u201d. Our dad didn\u2019t want to take us because he just hated stuff like that. So we didn\u2019t go. When we went back to our mom\u2019s house on Monday, the front page of the newspaper had a story about the fair being in town and the front page picture was very clearly my father, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend\u2019s daughter from the back. Over 30 years later, this is one of the main memories I have when remembering my now deceased father. \n\nOP, don\u2019t be the step-mom that lets something like this be your step-kids\u2019 core memories.

You can influence the kind of relationship they have with your own kids (siblings/allies/protectors or enemies/competitors/villains). Why not foster a sense of love and family between them, even if just for the sake of your own kids?", "I know this pain so well too. My dad married this woman who had two kids my age and they soon had one together. I'd say it was only when my dad wasn't around and at work, but it's happened a good bit with him home.

Even if she was like 22 when they met, 22 and 32 is a huge maturity gap. \n\nI think it\u2019s hard to judge her behavior without knowing how the older kids feel. Are they coming along because they want to, and their dad doesn\u2019t want them excluded? Or because their dad doesn\u2019t want to leave them home alone or take them somewhere else to hang out? I can see OP wanting to take the younger kids to something that caters to toddlers specifically, and having the older kids come along might make it difficult to make that work since they won\u2019t be interested in that stuff.

And depending on how much of the care and household stuff she does vs her husband I think she\u2019s starting to feel the burnout even if she\u2019s not necessarily admitting it. So I honestly think she deserves some leniency in that respect and that her husband should talk to the bio mom about picking up some extra hours during what\u2019s liable to actually be a stressful and tiring time for OP; caring for an infant and a toddler. \n\nNot trying to be obtuse but OP\u2019s been seemingly pulling her weight with her step kids so I fundamentally think there are compromises that can be reached at this particular time.", "Wonder how OP would feel if the situation was reversed and the husband said I just want to do stuff with OUR kinds, not YOUR kids.

My stepdad tried to do this (take a vacation or go on dinners with just his two sons with the exclusion of me), and while it rarely happened, it sucked knowing that he even thought of that. I didn\u2019t ask to be born into the family I was born into with the biological parents I had. Your stepchildren weren\u2019t consulted about their place in the universe either. Either they are your children, or they are not. You can\u2019t have it both ways, with favoring your biological children more than them.", "YTA. It would be one thing if you wanted to spend some time just with the older kids, and other times with the younger. Or wanted to spend time with each child individually. But the way your message reads, you think the older kids are \u201cless than\u201d, and while you\u2019ve taken on the domestic responsibilities for them you consider your biological children more worthy of your attention.\n\nYou said that the older children spend a couple hours a week with their bio mom. There are the couple hours you and your husband can spend together with the youngest kids. And let\u2019s be honest - for an infant and toddler two hours is a very long time. Otherwise, treat all the kids like they are full family members.", "YTA. The need to spend time with your biological children is natural, but the way you are going about it is wrong. Moreover, you\u2019ve known these kids for about 8 years, which is the majority of their lives. You are a very important parental figure to them, and your actions at present will affect them deeply. Speaking from experience, preferential treatment or even perceived preferential treatment will cut deeply, ESPECIALLY because they have grown up with you. In a situation where you would be a new step-mom, this might work differently. But it is important to love all five of your children equally. \n\nMore practically speaking, I would suggest this: especially because of the age difference, it seems logical to make plans (not huge ones like holidays, but maybe a day-trip) with the older kids as well as the younger ones. Be sure to explain to the older kids that you want to spend time doing age-appropriate activities with both, hence at times the separation. They need to know that, more or less, that when you spend an afternoon going to a playground with the younger kids, you will go spend an afternoon doing something they like (watch movies, go shopping, etc). Also, why not mix? You can accompany your younger children at one moment while the other kids go do something fun with dad, and the other way around. \n\nLastly, please reflect on why you feel this need to spend time with your husband and biological kids. Do you not see them as your own, even though you knowingly married a man with (at the time, veryyy young) kids? They might not be biologically your own, but they are biologically your husband\u2019s, the man you love most. Is that not reason enough (besides you essentially raising them) to love them as your own?", "Can you find a toddler-friendly activity for a few hours that you guys can take the little ones to on a Saturday morning or something? Swim lessons? Tiny tots? Those germ-infested romper rooms with ball pits only for kids in diapers? \n\nIf you're talking about heading off on vacation or something, then yeah YTA. Your husband was a package deal, and his bio kids have been living with you full-time since the oldest was SIX. I can barely remember much of anything before the age of six.

It would\u2019ve been really weird for them to exclude me from their family plans.

That\u2019s not much time for the toddlers to do much other than maybe go to the park or something right? The other thing that strikes me in the OP is the older two boys probably don\u2019t even remember a time when OP wasn\u2019t helping raise them. They would\u2019ve been four and two when she began as she put it being a mother figure.", "My parents didn't DO anything to me ....except teach me and my siblings that it was ok for us to have their undivided attention at times! \nYou have obviously NOT read her post....at all. \nYou just want to hate her cos she is a step mum. That's it....and that was obvious in you digging on my parents because they didn't do it the way you think they should.", "This isn't Highlander. There can be more than one.", "Well as I am not planning on anything happening to me or my husband, no. And I know my family would step in and help immensely but legally I want him to be the one on charge.  And I have sat him down and talked to/ asked his opinion on it and he was fully on board . I will also talk to him before signing anything and make sure he's still good with it .", "Lol yeah, why would you be surprised? I didn't make a secret of how disgusting I find these type of actions. \n\n>You have obviously NOT read her post\n\nI have and read all her comments to boot. She's a shitty stepmother that if given the chance I'm 99.9% sure would erase her step kids from existence.", "Especially since they all live with them. How are you going to leave 3 kids at home and do things without them? She wants her little family all alone but that's not what she signed on for. She knew they would live with her full-time but she wants her own special family unit that excludes the \"previous\" kids spoiling her fantasy. YTA. There is no way to do this without alienating the other kids unless it's something specific for toddlers.", "Not only this, she has been Dave's mother figure since he was 2 years old. He doesn't even remember a time when she wasn't", "They visit their mother for a few hours every second Saturday, OP said.", "Exactly. If the older kids don't want to go for some reason fine. You tell those kids ever once no you aren't coming irs just us time ...ten million percent TA", "If OP wanted separate activities due to AGE it would make some sense, yes. Absolutely. But that\u2019s not the reasoning even she is using\u2026so, I\u2019d say yikes.", "That\u2019s a husband problem the husband needs to fix, it isn\u2019t a problem you fix by crapping on the kids.", "Exactly what I was thinking! There\u2019s a place called Fairytale Town in my hometown that is tailored towards little kids.\n\nOr there is story time at the library. Lots of baby/tot activities if you look for them.", "See this is so sad! That\u2019s what Op is trying to do. I get evil stepmom witchy vibes", "They live with her 100% of the time. They only see their bio mom for a few hours every second week.", "Here too, my dad married a woman who knew he had 4 children. But for some reason my brothers were never really excluded like I was. She has a daughter of her own but no other children so I started the theory that she has a daughter but not sons so my brothers could be there but not the girl who is also an exact copy of her mom. I had a lot of issues with that woman", "It's so sad right?! Could you imagine having a woman in your life as a \"mom\" since 2 to be treated like that?!", "Your stepdaughter sounds rather lovely!", "For 6 years OP did not have any bio kids. So it was not an issue. Now that she has, her thinking is slowly changing. Its a step from thinking to saying to doing step motherly things in small increments", "YTA\n\nYou can have alone time with each of the kids and both parents. But you can\u2019t just have alone time with the youngest two and never with the oldest three.", "So then wouldn't it be fair for dad to take the 2 youngest out and leave OP home with the step kids? Maybe I misunderstand, I see a difference in dad taking kids on a trip and both parents taking the kids. Could just be me.", "But it's not about the age. It's about the fact that these children she has been the primary mother to for most of their lives are not actually considered her children by her and that is super disgusting.", "Because the younger ones are too young for the trip. Wanting to do different age related activities is fine. Wanting to divide the kids based on biological relationships is not fine.", ">Especially considering the age.\n\nI think this is what threw me off the most. The bio-kids are fucking 1 and 2 years old. What the hell are you gonna take them to go do? It's not like they could tell the older kids \"hey, we're going to a movie, but it's something only George and Harry would be interested in, so you can stay home\"", "Why do people choose to marry someone with kids if they're going to act like this? I genuinely don't understand", "I mean the youngest step child basically has been raised with not knowing any full time mother but her - the second youngest close to that too. \n\nClearly she doesn't see them as her real kids. Pretty sad for those kids.", "Oof same I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that !", "That's crazy to me. We sometimes involve my stepdaughters sister even though she has no connection to us at all (her moms daughter with stepfather) and her own stepfather has never once excluded her. I don't know why people can't just accept all the kids they chose. I never even wanted kids & would do anything for both of them", "Because equity is better than equality oftentimes, that\u2019s why. Older kids get time alone with their bio mom and with their bio dad. Little kids should get a few hours with bio mom and bio dad, too, yes?", "Where did she allude *whatsoever* to not considering them her children?", "We're just teaching the OP how to manipulate her step kids better with comments like this. We're teaching her logical explanations that most people would buy when her problem is really an emotional disconnect from her stepchildren. \n\nShe's the kind of person who save all the really fun activities for her own kids and then pretend not to understand why the older kids are staying they never get to do anything fun on their outings.", "> I can understand OP wanting to do a few baby toddler oriented activities that the older kids don\u2019t want to participate in, or complain about. \n\nThat's the part I don't get. Don't the three older kids ever want time without the toddlers? You think they'd be thrilled to get sent on a group outing with some other friends while their parents and younger siblings do something else. Or stay home and play videogames together for a few hours while the parents take the toddlers to the park. \n\nI can't imagine being a kid that age and *wanting* to have every single outing involve my parents and a pair of toddlers. This feels like it should be really easy to arrange. I wonder if the husband is the only actual stumbling block here.", "That\u2019s how I see it. The kids should not be treated as second class citizens\u2026you\u2019re right, it\u2019s just mean.", "Yes, that does also seem fair.", "\"AITA for wanting to spend time with just my husband and two children?\"\n\nThat seems to indicate a difference I think.", "That's possible, but I wouldn't assume it. I liked this comment because it assumed the OP was posting in good faith and it offered a practical suggestion.", "Oooof. I have a friend whose ex did this to their daughter. He didn\u2019t tell her, but her half sister mentioned it when they got back because she has been told that the oldest didn\u2019t want to go, which is why it was during her mom\u2019s custody time. It took my friend\u2019s daughter about three years to talk to her dad again and then it was only for money. She felt it was appropriate since he told her half siblings, when the truth came out that she just wasn\u2019t invited,  he didn\u2019t include her because of the expense.", "I\u2019m so happy to hear that!", "Who said that they should sit at home waiting for the other kids to get home? That is when they should do something with them\u2026as a family of 4. I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that they sit at home waiting for the step kids to come home. TBH, a few hours is plenty of time for an activity for  little ones. A children\u2019s museum\u2026even going to the park. They don\u2019t need more than that at their ages.", "Stepmother would be an improvement from mother figure.", "Thank you for this comment. \nsigned, step child.", "Happy cake day! \n\nThis was my thought as well to do activities with two younger children when other children are with their biological mother and maybe activities suitable to the age of younger children which older kids would not find interesting. \n\nBut I somehow think that OP did not have this in mind which would make her an AH in my opinion.", "LOL!\nThat\u2019s exactly somehing she\u2019s do! The funniest shit is she has 0 self awareness, she even tried to trash talk my step dad several times when i had become an adult.\n\nMy stepdad who was very strict, and i did have a LOT of arguments and fights with, and arguably had a worse relationship with because our personalities would clash.\nDespite this, he made sure i was invited to everything. Even though he knew we\u2019d get into an argument on every vacation. He invited me to stuff he knew i didnt want to attend to, but wanted to make me feel included", "Well, he fathered all of them. Apparently, he sees them all as his children. Fancy that. OP could be the world's warmest, most dedicated stepmother, but there is truly not a parallel with her husband. My stepdaughter said that one reason she liked me right off the bat was I didn't try to be her mother. Stepson OTOH, liked to call me mom. Their mother had died, and they were older, but you can see how every child has their own experience of it, and OP can't be expected to feel exactly as dad does.\n\nI think what's missing here is more discussion between the OP and her husband. Not about what she wants, but what she *feels* and what *he* feels. Her post was pretty much devoid of feelings, and that's both worrisome and in need of a remedy.", "It\u2019s only fair if ALL the adults in these children\u2019s lives are shitty.", "Thanks for the cake day acknowledgment.", "Right? And worse as she states their bio Mum is pretty much rarely involved. I think she legit meant leaving them behind at home \ud83d\ude2c this woman's a real piece of work.", "Entirely agree with you, especially that last paragraph, communication & the lack of emotion, she seems to be on auto pilot,worrisome indeed. \nEight years is a long time to be stepping up & then have this on the mind.", "I\u2019m really close with my sister who is 18 years younger than I am. Always have been. We have sibling unity. We are actually closer than I am to the siblings who are very near my age.", "I have a 13 and 16 year gap between my little sisters and I and I tend to think we bonded well when they were little. I would actually like to spend more time with them since they're 16 and 19 now.", "This is what I was wondering the entire time reading OPs post. Whaddya mean, you get your wish twice a month, every month? This is entirely OP playing favourites & it\u2019s despicable", "She is. I'm very proud of both my kids", "Well that's on them, that's the best time for it."]}
