I sat there for another hour and they still hadn't come back so I started looking around for them. After 30 mins of looking for them, I eventually found them and they said that I could go get food and then when I come back we can go. It took me about an hour to go and get food and then come back. Once I got back, they were both missing. I walked up and down that river trying to find them and couldn't. I waited another 40mins at the spot where we planned on meeting and they still hadn't come back. I couldnt text/call either of them because they had left all their belongings at the spot we swam at when we first arrived. At this point I was really pissed off so I texted nates phone and said I was leaving and that they can find there own lift home. \n\nAs soon as I got back into town, he started ringing me constantly and yelling at me saying that I embarrassed him infront of his friend and that now they are stranded and that I had to pick them up. I refused and silenced my phone. 2 hours later he came back home and called me an asshole for leaving him and his friend out there and that they had to hitch-hike back home.

Especially aftetr you'd already accommodated them a couple of times over an extended period of time. Like 5+ hours?! C'mon.\n\nBut, you don't leave the scene when you have people missing on the water. Especially drunk people. You look until you find them or call for help. And they need to understand that they're accountable for their presence when they're on the water. This could just as easily been \"AITA for letting my drunk boyfriend and his friend drown?\"\n\nThe whole lot of you need to grow the fuck up and show some respect and care for one another.

I\u2019m glad they\u2019re okay, but when they were \u201cmissing\u201d - did it not occur to you they could have drowned? I\u2019m surprised you just left without confirming they were okay.", "You definitely are NTA. I had a friend like this too that was always late for everything and made everyone else delayed in the process. We went to a convention we do every year and I decided to be the driver. I set a clear expectation on when I wanted to leave on the final day and this was including a later check out I scheduled with the hotel.\n\nMy expectation was that we were checking out at 4PM. The room was a mess but I had everything packed and cleaned up as I had wanted to get home. Closer to 4:15ish I had texted her and she just decided she \"having fun\" and lost track of time and would start getting around to coming back. If you consider they would have to leave the convention center, trek back and then pack their stuff I would be holding the ball close to another hour. I made the decision to just tell them that I valued my time and went to my car.\n\nI let them go to voicemail a few times while I calmed myself down. I shit you not, not less then 15 minutes go by and she had already called her BF to come and get them. The fact that she literally was so quick to bail herself out when it mattered to her time was all I needed to know. I took a break from that friendship because I was tired of the nonsense. \n\nYou did good setting clear boundaries and consequences.", "ESH - y t a because you came back to your friend and boyfriend MISSING when they had been swimming in a river.  You should have called the freaking police if you couldn't find them.  They could have drowned.  They're assholes for not keeping in contact with you.", "NTA - you went back to try and find them and they weren't where you had agreed. Are you just supposed to sit around on your own for hours waiting? You always respect the drivers wishes since they are doing you a favour!", "NTA", "I am absolutely speechless at the number of SOs and BFs/GFs on Reddit that are willing to call their partner and AH. I have been with my husband for almost 20 years and we have never once called each other that kind of a name. Is this really the type of person you want to be with? NTA.", "I'm going to go against the grain a bit on this one and say soft ESH.  They are DEFINITELY TA for being so careless with your time.  But, I say soft YTA because you didn't warn them that you were going to abandon them if they weren't ready when you returned.  Where I live, hitchhiking is pretty unsafe and you could have put their lives at risk leaving them stranded which doesn't feel like apt punishment for their crime.  However, if that's not the case where you're at, then I'd ammend my ruling to NTA for you.", "NTA Your time is valuable and shouldn't be wasted by inconsiderate douchbags.", "NTA", "NTA at all", "NTA, I would probably have set times when they wanted to go upstream and/or when you went out for food, as long is very subjective, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t have to wait for them for hours", "I can't believe people are saying n t a. ESH, they made you wait, but you endangered their safety! What you did was completely reckless, as they could have gotten seriously hurt and had no way to get help.", "Exactly.", "I agree. I'm sure op could find a more considerate bf.", "Then it\u2019s time for him to get his drivers license", "They should've stuck the rivers and lake they're used to", "They're gonna do what they want or nothing at all.", "Idk he was not concerned about your time and you were not concerned for his safety. Match made in heaven ESH", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriend is a dick for wasting your time, but you left him in what could have been a very unsafe position.  I hope he learned not to fuck around with you, and I hope you don't end up in a position where it seems like a justifiable choice to leave someone an hour away from their home again.", "ESH. Yea they suck for being careless when having fun and not being super considerate. But you routinely checked in the first few times and AGREED to wait or go do your own thing while they swam. It\u2019s super wack to leave them an HOUR away from home. I would\u2019ve waited and then talked to them about how they weren\u2019t being considerate and made some clear boundaries for any next time. There\u2019s no love from any side so why even be together.", "Sounds like he\u2019s treating you like his parents.   Someone to pick me up and drop me off at my convenience.\n\nThink of it this way.   He knew you were hungry, he knew you were waiting and continued to do exactly what he wanted and just expected you to wait dutifully.  It\u2019s the height of selfishness and entitlement.  He needed a wakeup call that his is not a game you\u2019re gonna play", "YTA", "NTA. I'd dump him just for the \"made me look bad in front of my friend\" comment.

That\u2019s just unsafe. I\u2019d wait, yell at them and maybe dump him! But not just leave them.", "Agreed completely. They definitely sucked a LOT for being so inconsiderate while they were having fun, but OP agreed to their delays over and over. I would be super annoyed at my bf but I wouldn\u2019t just abandon him and his friend an hour away from home at some random river! And honestly, why drive an HOUR to go somewhere just to stay for only one hour and drive another hour home (OPs initial plan).", "Yeah, the relationship might be over if I have to wait that fucking long, but I still would make sure they\u2019re okay. \n\nI have anxiety so I know I always assume the worst, but damn, I\u2019d rather do that than just leave someone in a potentially vulnerable position just because I\u2019m angry.", "Yea, that\u2019s a very sketch situation to put them in - and while they did \u201cmake\u201d her wait, she DID put them in that position intentionally. It was her attempt to punish them. But honestly there wasn\u2019t much to punish if she kept saying \u201cokay\u201d to their requests to hang out a bit longer. She should\u2019ve said no to begin with if she was going to throw such a fit.

EXTREMELY sketch!!!!! \nAnd as others mentioned - they could have been harmed at the river but she only thought about herself and left. They ALSO were being selfish, but that doesn\u2019t negate OPs actions.", "NTA\n\nWith all that waiting around, boyfriend and his friend are just using OP as a free and very patient taxi service.", "NTA\u2026 dump him", "ESH. I would have called the cops. They could have drowned.

Why didn't they just stay at the meeting spot?  Why go wandering off for that long?", "Rule of thumb. You go swimming somewhere, someone goes adventuring, you stay put.
