My boyfriends (lets call him Nate), friend (M20) was with us when we decided to go out so obviously we asked him if he would like to join and he said yes, so Nate and I searched up the nearest swimming spot and found one that was an hour drive away. Just for reference I am the only person out of the 3 of us that has a license and car so I was the one driving.\n\nOnce we got to this beautuful river we went straight into the water and after about an hour of swimming, i got out but they wanted to keep swimming so I said that's fine and let them continue. 30mins later Nate came up to me and said that they wanted to explore upstream and I said i didn't mind but i told them to not take long because I was starting to get tired and hungry. I sat there for another hour and they still hadn't come back so I started looking around for them. After 30 mins of looking for them, I eventually found them and they said that I could go get food and then when I come back we can go. It took me about an hour to go and get food and then come back. Once I got back, they were both missing. I walked up and down that river trying to find them and couldn't. I waited another 40mins at the spot where we planned on meeting and they still hadn't come back. I couldnt text/call either of them because they had left all their belongings at the spot we swam at when we first arrived. At this point I was really pissed off so I texted nates phone and said I was leaving and that they can find there own lift home. \n\nAs soon as I got back into town, he started ringing me constantly and yelling at me saying that I embarrassed him infront of his friend and that now they are stranded and that I had to pick them up. I refused and silenced my phone. 2 hours later he came back home and called me an asshole for leaving him and his friend out there and that they had to hitch-hike back home. I do feel bad for leaving them now but they did make me wait 4 hours for them. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1674735495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lqi8b/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_and_his_friend_and/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No way I would have gone to get him food!\n\nIf you give him a 2nd chance, and thats a big if in my opinion, tell him any more disrespectful behaviour and your done. Oh and from now on he drives himself anywhere he needs to go.", "NTA! there are limits to everything, it seems like your BF spent the time with his friend, not you anyway, so you were basically just the driver for his and his friends outing. not being able to find them is weird. where were they? your BF is mad but he learned a valuable lesson.", "Lose the boyfriend", "nta. you\u2019re young and you should dump him", "I would say NTA. \n\nYou had told them more than twice that you wanted to leave soon, they just disregarded how you felt and just went MIA. Maybe slightly YTA for not coming back to pick them up but IMO they were not considerate of you as well. If it was Nate who was there for a long time trying to find you, would he be chill?", "NTA. They were being super rude and inconsiderate by leaving you for four entire hours. I don't blame you for leaving them when you couldn't find them. They weren't at the meeting point and you couldn't get a hold of them. That's on them.", "ESH. \n\nI presume you and Nate have broken up? \n\nNate was almost completely oblivious to your needs and desires after the first hour. If I were you, I would have stayed until they showed up but once home alone would have made sure he knew that if he was ever so dismissive and disrespectful of you again your relationship would be over.\n\nYou stranded him an hour away. That is a relationship ending act. If I were Nate, I would have dumped you on my return.\n\nSo where had he and his boyfriend snuck off to for sex while you  were getting food and waiting, third wheel?", "YTA your boyfriend is missing and you just bounced?? You left them stranded an hour drive away with no way of coming back on their own. At no point did told him you wanted to leave. You were hungry you got some food, you were tired, you could take a nap. You are the only one with a vehicle and a drink license, meaning if anything bad happens it's on you. You don't want the responsibility, don't go.", "If he left you would it had been ok? ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
