Marky\u2019s parents should have corrected his behavior and told him it wasn\u2019t nice to call anyone an ugly monster.   Sounds like they are raising an entitled child with zero empathy for others.", "Oh honey you are not the asshole. I would have done the same thing.  Your child is beautiful. And the parents should have taught the boy better. Unfortunately tolerance was also no taught to them apparently.  So disgusting that they did this.  I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA - my son is 5 and would literally never say something like this about another person because parenting requires parents to actually do the parenting and clearly your \u201cfriends\u201d worry a lot less about doing that in order to create a decent human being. And if for whatever reason this does happen anyways with decent parents, those parents should immediately step in and offer an explanation and use it as a teachable moment. If they are going to use the excuse that he\u2019s a kid and doesn\u2019t understand why wouldn\u2019t they have tried to explain it before they went there? They\u2019re dicks. I\u2019m so sorry this happened.", "NTA. Marky's parents could have explained, and aked him to apologize. They chose not to.", "NTA.\n\nMarky\u2019s parents had a teachable moment, but chose to teach him it\u2019s okay to be cruel to others who are different, while your daughter cries in the background. You don\u2019t need friends like Marky\u2019s parents.", "NTA. Your friends really dropped the ball here!", "Whoa! NTA for sure. Good job sticking up for your kid and telling them to leave", "NTA but Jack and Donna seem to be. They did nothing to explain and correct his behavior and could not even see what was wrong with that.", "NTA. Yes, he's a kid and doesn't understand - but your friends should have stepped after the first time he said that to explain to him and have him apologize to her.  That was their responsibility, not yours  - and it was horrible of them to just brush it off like that.  That they called you an AH is WAY over the line, and you would be justified in cutting them out of your life if that's what you want to do.\n\nGood job on your part for how you handled it.\n\nEdit: Actually they should have not only taught their child not to call people names because of how they look, they also should have talked to him about your child before visiting.", "NTA. You were protecting your daughter and it's your friend's responsibility to teach their son respecting other people.", "NTA\n\nYour friends though... UGH  It's THEIR job to tell their son he was being inappropriate.  You were also right to expect his parents to correct him.  He may not be old enough to know, but he's old enough to start learning.  Heck, they should have talked to him before they even got there.  Sorry that your friend let you down, it must be disappointing.", "NTA,  \nI don't blame the kid, but the parents are awefull. Basically the kid is behaving as he is taught by his parents.", "NTA. Kids mirror their parents behavior. He is never going to learn manners, tact or respect with those parents.", "NTA. If these are your lifelong friends, what are your enemies like?", "NTA. Your friends, however, are giant assholes.\nThey could've prepped their kid about your daughter's condition. They could've demanded he apologize, or they could've eliminated all of that by teaching their kid not to be a jerk and a bully. My kids were aware by 2-3 that some people don't look, dress, or have the same abilities as them, but that's OK. My kids weren't the same to them, and that's why we don't judge or make fun of people. Children's curiosity is OK. How they approach the situation is a different story.  In preschool, my daughter met a child in a wheelchair. She asked the girl why she was in the wheelchair and then asked her if she wanted to color.", "NTA. The boy learned that behavior somewhere.", "NTA! Jesus Christ.", "The sad truth is, Little Marky has heard his parents talking before they arrived. And he\u2019s parroting what he\u2019s heard his parents say in the car on the way over, at the house, and probably several days beforehand.\n\nTypically 5/6 year old children are way happier to play, eat snacks, and run around. What they don\u2019t do unprompted is over and over call a fellow child who is their age \u201ca monster\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve not seen that type of a bad seed little boy who would do something so terrible, unless his parents had already started up his engine of hate.\n\nSo sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I couldn't forgive parents who didn't jump in before you had a chance to open your mouth & tell the 6 year old he was being hurtful. You'd think they'd have had some experience with other kids & adults who look unusual.

They definitely should have apologised for such inexcusable rudeness.", "Indeed. I can't help but believe this isn't the very first person this kid has ever see, who didn't look completely typical.", "This. It's possible that if a child that age saw someone who looked different from what they were used to, they might get anxious or curious and begin asking questions, or be a bit shy of the new child. Those are pretty common reactions to newness in general. But they don't call anyone names like that just for existing, unless they're parroting their parents or someone else very close to them. They wouldn't think of it. At most, they might say something like, \"I don't like Jada, she looks funny,\" while shying away... and the correct response to that, from any decent parent, is, \"Jada is just another child like you and your friends, honey. Come on, if you don't want to go alone how about we go say hi together, hmm?\" \n\nThe only way he would get names like \"ugly monster\" is by quoting somebody near him.

A child old enough to vocalise \"ugly monster\" is a child old enough to be taught that is not acceptable.\n\nI hope your beautiful daughter had a lovely birthday regardless.", "NTA. A 6 year old can absolutely understand that it's not okay to name call. His parents are failing miserably.", "NTA, 6 year olds are old enough to understand that words hurt.
