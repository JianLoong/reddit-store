I\u2019m not American Idol good but I\u2019m a considered a ringer at karaoke night by my friends. \n\nI was a groomsman for my best friend \u201cTravis\u201d (23M) wedding to \u201cTaylor\u201d (23F). Taylor has been the exact opposite of a bridezilla. The only non negotiable thing she had was that she did not want a track playing when she walked down the aisle, and wanted a live band. A reasonable request. They had Enchanted by Taylor Swift as their walk down song, as it was the song he proposed to her during one of our karaoke nights.\n\nWell day of the wedding comes, and the lead singer of the band ends up passing out during rehearsal. She had to leave to go to the hospital. As Travis couldn\u2019t see her, I had to go inform Taylor through a bridesmaid. Bridesmaid comes back and states that while Taylor was Empathetic and she understood, she was still adamant about no tracks. She asked if I was willing to sing in place, but I told her that my voice wouldn\u2019t fit the song she wanted. Bridesmaids asked me to do whatever I needed to do and try to make something work\n\nI spoke with the band, and I asked if they were able to learn \u201cTrue\u201d by Ryan Cabrera, a relatively simple song with an hours notice, and a song I know my voice can handle. They were willing to and after a quick readjustment rehearsal with those actually walking down the aisle, minus Taylor, wedding happened. I perform the song, and although somewhat confused, Taylor seemed very happy. I then take place in my position as a groomsman.\n\nAt the photos portion, Taylor came up to me and jumped me with a hug, thanking me for stepping in. She asked why I changed the song but after a brief explanation of how my voice wouldn\u2019t have worked, she understood, and said she was happy I chose that song.\n\nTravis, on the other hand, was not very talkative to me. After the reception and following days, he ghosted me. After finally having enough I went over to his place to talk this out. This is where all went loose. \n\nHe was very upset with me for changing the song, knowing it was Taylor\u2019s favorite song and I couldn\u2019t have sucked it up for literally 5 minutes. I defended by stating the following: 1. I was following Taylor\u2019s ONE request for no track music. 2. My voice would have made any of the video footage taken ruined because the song didn\u2019t fit my voice. 3. I chose another song that I KNOW he and Taylor loved and that I could actually sing. He basically removed all that by stating that I should have done what was requested in the first place. As soon as I mentioned how Taylor didn\u2019t mind, he kicked me out.\n\nSeveral people are divided. Our friend group, aka the groomsmen, are taking Travis\u2019 side and stating how I\u2019m the jerk. The bridemaids, Taylor\u2019s friends, are defending me for choosing a song that I could sing and was still wedding appropriate. Taylor has remained silent about this, as she is Travis\u2019 wife, but know I did what I could. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know what to make of everything.
