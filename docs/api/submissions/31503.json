You however didn't do anything wrong.", "The western brides who are always so concerned with being upstaged then proceed to wear the most plain dress, small stud earrings and a dainty little necklace. \n\nMaybe it's the south Asian in me but I can't fathom how the white wedding dresses cost upwards of 2k with so little embellishments and I got my wedding lehenga for 200$ and it was heavily embroidered, and weighed about 20lbs alone.", "I always figured that a normal part of weddings is some people dressed in their finery.

They are beautiful, and since you are native appropriate for any occasion, let alone a non-formal wedding. \nBut if you would give me the Pic and ask if they are okay for a wedding without further information, I would say that they are too informal for a black tie or white tie wedding.", "Definitely NTA. These are just 70s fashion.", "NTA. Wow. I am glad you posted the pic. I was thinking possibly if the earrings were something outlandish. This looks perfectly acceptable to any wedding. The bride was being absurd. I\u2019m sorry this happened.", "In this case I would wear them. There is nothing over the top about them, and if we where really splitting hairs here, the only \"problem\" if we look at Eoropean wedding etiquet, is that there are a few gold beads in the set.\n\nStricktly, strickly this only applies to morning weddings where you should only wear silver or pearls.\n\nGold and diamonds are evening assesories", "They are both pretty and easily categorized as \u201ccasual\u201d - not in terms of the quality or appearance, but it\u2019s not flashy or obviously super expensive. Like I have to be careful about wearing Indian jewelry to western events because it\u2019s mostly gold and usually has jewels in it which tend to be interpreted as fancy in these settings.

Why is everything judged to be upstaging the bride right now?  It used to be common courtesy to dress in your finest clothes to attend a wedding.  And by finest I don\u2019t mean gaudy or flashy.

A guest can look good and receive a few compliments without taking anything away from the bride.   \n\nYour earrings were attractive but not huge and attention grabbing.  \n\nYour NTA.

This is what I\u2019m thinking too.

Dress was chosen well in advance.", "Seriously! I\u2019m just so confused about all these terrible wedding issues. Probably it\u2019s a consequence of social media, but weddings sound awful anymore. Telling guests what to wear. All this angst about upstaging the bride. 3-4 pre-wedding events the wedding party must attend and /or pay for. If I were young now, I\u2019d turn down every invitation and plan to elope myself. Yikes.", "I can say the dress was not the problem.

And still, a teal dress is not at all something flashy or that would call for attention. I've seen plenty of people using this color on weddings.\nI don't understand why you would think that just because OP was wearing teal she is in the wrong. What would be an appropriate color then? You can't wear black, red, teal?\nI honestly don't get it. The only color I see as forbidden in a wedding would be white.
