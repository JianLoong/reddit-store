Had people in jeans and cowboy boots, basic sundresses, old prom dresses and tuxes (some definitely from another era).

I would've complimented you & asked for your shop's name so I could purchase my own pair as your beadwork is fabulous. BTW, do you have an online shop?", "Ma'am I was expecting a whole ass turquoise squash blossom that's studded in diamonds. This is super chill, nta", "Jesus titty fucking Christ.  How the bride saw these and thought you were upstaging her is beyond me.  They're pretty btw.\n\nI would honestly put money towards her jealousy of you and her now husbands friendship.  This isn't about the earrings.  This is about you being her husbands friend.  Give it a little bit and you'll likely start seeing and hearing from him less and less, or, she'll outright tell you herself, or have him tell you to step away.\n\nNTA", "Honestly the bride is lucky OP isn't Nigerian, she'd have had a meltdown. We dress to kill at weddings!! . Your earrings are so modest by Nigerian standards that they are worn for informal outings only.", "You're missing the obvious. It's not the earrings; it's that you're Native American. Sarah is racist. \n\nNTA", "They\u2019re awesome! And very appropriate for a wedding. NTA", "wait, THOSE were the earrings? Those got the bride having the vapors?!?!?!?", "Lovely.\n\nBut they're just earrings. I see nothing wrong with them and I bet they went well with a teal dress.", "I was expecting larger pieces of turquoise with her reaction, like some of the more raw shaped, but polished, drop earrings with multiple sizes of turquoise. \n\nNTA, the bride is ridiculous.", "W the actual F. These are So not flashy attention grabbing statement earrings. That bride is insane!! I don't think she likes you and just wanted to make you miserable from the start. Sorry OP. Hope you get to wear these for more occasions.", "These are beautiful and perfect for a wedding. You did nothing wrong.", "Oh good grief, you are fine. The bride needed to get a grip. NTA. Pretty earring by the way.", "Those are (very!) cool earrings, but if they upstaged the bride, what the hell was she wearing, a burlap sack? NTA.", "My mum wears earrings like this a lot and they are not flashy wtf", "NTA, not even close.", "I wonder if she actually just has a problem with you, as her husband\u2019s friend. Maybe she has a jealousy issue and seeing you get even a little bit of attention sent her over the edge?", "Oh my god THESE are the earrings that caused drama???? Holy shit. No. No. You are not the asshole. That\u2019s INSANE.", "Oh she\u2019s TRIPPING - is the bride a WOC?", "Oooo, pretty! The bride sounds like she\u2019s nuts. You did nothing wrong.", "Youre NTA, and the beadwork is beautiful!", "Oh ffs she\u2019s a drama queen. Those are perfectly acceptable! They\u2019re very pretty", "NTA and why would anyone get upset about that? Bride sounds sus.", "Seriously? Those are lovely, and I bet they looked amazing with a teal dress, but I don't see them as attention-grabbing. The bride was out of line.", "They're really pretty \ud83d\udc9e! They seem like a fairly average size for dangly earrings. It's not like they're the size of dinner plates or something. It sounds like the bride was just looking for an excuse to pick a fight with you. Maybe she's jealous of your friendship with the groom?", "Those are gorgeous", "They're inventing drama for the sake of it.  NTA", "These are GORGEOUS. \n\n\n\nBut... How boring did the bride look that she felt upstaged?  Or did you also carry a neon sign saying \"LOOK AT MY EARRINGS. NOT AT THE BRIDE\"", "These are not even flashy, just nice. I guess you were supposed to wear a potato sack? NTA", "NTA\n\nWhen you said indigenous, the simple beaded earrings are what I thought of.  \n\nLet's face it, you were just too damn \"ethnic\" for her Wonder Bread self..", "WTH Not flashy AT ALL.", "If by flashy she means\u2026? Sorry I couldn\u2019t find anything overtly flashy about these. NTA.    \n\nOn a positive note: very pretty earrings!", "Those earrings are amazing!  Great handiwork.  NTA, bride is bonkers.  She clearly has it out for you for some other reason.  Probably jealousy.", "She thought those were too much?\n\nThey look like normal earrings (in terms of size), and are not at all flashy or attention grabbing. \n\nNTA, the bride is off the rails.", "Picture is posted on the comments", "Lol what? Teal? Seriously? Are you the bride?", "I just saw the pic. What the fuck? I thought they would at least be jewelled. Brides are a psychotic different species that we need to do a lot more research on.", "This is my thoughts as well. I've never been married but if I was having a wedding I'd demand that everyone be their most fabulous selves. I'd be so sad if everyone showed up looking like a regular Tuesday because they thought I was that fragile.", "That reminds me from Jim and Pam's infamous wedding episode on The Office, one of the guests in the background was wearing a kilt. Maybe either Jim or Pam had Scottish heritage.", "As a white western woman I envy South Asian wedding traditions more. The clothes are beautiful, they seem more fun, red is a much better color than white, and everyone puts in 110% effort in looking their best. Maybe it is because I find American weddings boring but hey that is just me.", "Ikr? My wife's lehenga cost about $400 and was pretty heavy, when I went dress shopping for Western dresses they started at $1300 \ud83e\udee0", "My Latin American ass is always shocked when i  see an American wedding with guests wearing jeans, flip flops and simple dresses. I feel like I would get my ass kicked  for my regular wedding guest looks (floor length gown, full makeup with lashes, fancy jewelry, all the works) ir would be odd and even disrespectful to show up not wearing and looking your  best. The only big no is white dresses", "Frankly, weddings where everyone is uber-dressed up end up having the same effect as the very understated ones; everything is a blur of colour and bling and no one is standing out. But, sure, brides who make a big deal are just insecure. The reality is that the majority of guests (certainly most men) aren't going to pay much attention to what another guest is wearing, they are their for the wedding and the party, not to critique the outfits. And a person dressed up so much that they \"upstage\" the bride is more likely to get negative attention than steal the show; if someone shows up in a ballgown when the bride is wearing a minimal dress and the rest of the guests  are in cocktail attire, the few people who do spare more than a thought on them are thinking \"dress code fail\" and \"poor dear, it must be so uncomfortable to be overdressed\", not falling down in admiration. And that is even more likely if the guest is wearing something atypical for a western event.", "Hence my suspicion these kinds of AITA posts are by 16 year olds who have little to no experience at real weddings LOL", "Yeah, those are lovely earrings, and I bet they looked great with OP's dress, but if you can upstage a bride that easily, she hasn't got much going on. NTA.", "I laughed out loud. This is so ridiculous. What was the bride wearing, a burlap sack? Those are normal earrings!!", "Right!  When I first started reading I expected Princess Diana level earrings or something.  These are gorgeous and totally appropriate.   I also don\u2019t understand the \u201cupstage the bride thing\u201d. Unless you\u2019re wearing white!", "I think so also. It seems like something else is up with that bride.", "\u2026\u201dauntie on the hunt\u201d?", "lol Jesus. You had your wisdom teeth made into earrings? Talk about upcycling! lol", "U didn't live in San Francisco in late 80s, did you?  I was an assistant at the time, a youngster had his wisdoms removed intact and he walked out with 2 of them on their hoop earrings!\n\nEdit spelling", "And I bet no one would even bat an eye.", "Those are gorgeous!", "Same question, would love to buy!", "yeah, I'd be very surprised if none of the other guests also wore something the same level of \"flashy\" as those earrings.\n\n NTA OP, (I hope I'm wrong but) it sounds like she's insecure about her husband being close friends with another woman and would have found a petty excuse to have a go at you no matter what you wore.", "NTA.", "Wait are you telling me that I'm not supposed to carry a neon sign saying \"LOOK AT MY EARRINGS. NOT AT THE BRIDE\"", "Tell your friend. Let him know EXACTLY what happened.", "It's big! Very noticeable. I imagine it looked good with your teal dress. But you didn't blend into the generic background she set up, so she got jealous. Unfortunately, I think she is likely to react the same way in any situation when you wear your indigenous jewelry. I think that is likely to be the kind of person she is.", "The last wedding I attended had a cosplay/costume theme. The couple said their vows in front of a big stargate. It was nerdy and fun, and absolutely nobody was mistaken about who the brides were.", "I'm also a white Western woman and South Asian weddings look like so much more fun! Both my sisters had amazing weddings but they were also kind of boring. \n\nI'm shocked at how cheap lehengas are too! They're so gorgeous and laden with embroidery/other embellishments that I definitely expected them to be worth more, just for the work that must be involved in making them.", "Actually, it's not just you...", "Big same sis. Weddings in other cultures are so much more aesthetically pleasing with the colors and the fabrics and the jewels on everyone, not just the bride", "As a New Yorker, the only wedding I've ever been to where guests were wearing jeans and super casual stuff was in the south.  Alabama, specifically.   I was in a floor length sundress and my daughter at the time was 3.5 months old and dressed fancier than the adult guests. \n\nI felt so over dressed and unprepared because the other guests showed up with boxes and wrapped gifts and we just did as NYers do and gave them cash in a card \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\n(And when I say 'as a NYer' - I mean the boroughs and long island are basically our own little area and all of upstate fits in more with the South \ud83d\ude02)", "> My Latin American ass is always shocked when i see an American wedding with guests wearing jeans, flip flops and simple dresses.\n\nTo be fair, that's not common here in the US. *Most* weddings are formal, and basically follow the guidelines you outlined - nothing white that looks like a wedding dress, but suits or at least collared shirts for the guys, nice (though not necessarily floor length) dresses or pantsuits (or similar) for the ladies.", "I mean..  I wear bigger earrings than that to go to the grocery store.  I do live in Oklahoma though.", "IYKYK\nSingle Women on the Powwow trail looking to snag.", "YOU MADE THESE EARRINGS?!?!?!", "They\u2019re amazing!", "NTA. Those are beautiful and I bet they looked great with your dress.", "These are beautiful! Do you have an online store?", "No!  You were supposed to bring the spinning sandwich board \"hey guys! Look at me!\" But spin it super fast to not let the bride realize what it says.", "My cousin lives in FL and did a halfvitation (like maybe if you can, you could sorta come here for the wedding without mentioning a date) and when I saw the pictures I realized I would has outshone probably everyone had I gone to the wedding", "I'm not even thirty, but already the lingo of this decade makes me feel so old.", "Wedding culture across the US is pretty fascinating.  Just like how different it is from state to state and how social media has really emphasized it.", "So it honestly depends on the person what they prefer. I don't mind being called Native American or Indigenous", "Isn't it for Canada ?", "I'm 36 and have been saying this since I was 15?", "No teenager talks like this."]}
