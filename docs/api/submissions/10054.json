I also have ADHD and have the issue of assuming that taking something downstairs would take too long when I'm rushing, but when you time yourself doing it, you quickly see that it isn't that long.

This was made worse by the fact that I probably only do 30% of household chores as it is.\n\nWhen I finally broke down and got angry at her for making me feel guilty by doing my chores before I could I got a blank stare. \n\nApparently maintaining the family vehicles, garden equipment, and the house, are also worthwhile contributions to the family.

We keep the list for us to tackle and so the other partner is aware there is an issue.  I am better at cleaning, painting, plumbing, and furniture repair.  He is better with electrical, lights/ceiling fans, and small door repairs.  We do room renos (new flooring, new baseboards, carpet removal - team effort) together.
