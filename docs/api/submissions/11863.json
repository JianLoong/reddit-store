Apparently up until that point I'd assumed we'd be splitting it while she had assumed I'd be paying the whole bill. The reason she assumed this is because I picked the restaurant, and I'll admit it is kind of expensive, however I assumed that if it was out of her price range she would've suggested a more affordable option. \n\nWhen I asked her how we were going to split it she got embarrassed because apparently she earns minimum wage and lives with her parents, so she couldn't afford what she ordered. I'll admit I was a little annoyed because I'd assumed we'd be splitting the bill, however I paid for both of ours and then we left. Later that night I got a long text message from her calling me an asshole for embarrassing her like that in the restaurant. I apologized for assuming we'd be splitting the bill, and told her she shouldn't expect for someone to buy her a meal she can't afford herself. \n\nAfter this she blocked me, and I was just wondering, AITA in this situation?\n\nEdit: For some context, when I say I \"picked\" the restaurant I mean that I'm the one who suggested the restaurant we went to. I didn't unilaterally say \"We're going to x restaurant,\" there was an open dialogue about the plans.

This is from a \u201cwho issued the invitation\u201d standpoint, not necessarily from a gender roles perspective.  From a manners standpoint, it sounds like your annoyance clearly showed on your face or in your words/actions as your date, no matter how rude, felt humiliated.  Even if you find out after that experience that she\u2019s not a good match for you, it seems a better reflection on you to be gracious in that moment even as you choose not to spend any more time with her in the future.  Perhaps you were incredibly polite and her response was insanely disproportionate, but it\u2019s good to consider the possibility that there was some impetus for her reaction (aside from fully acknowledging that she wasn\u2019t very mature or gracious herself).

If you come from different economic backgrounds or cultures, it's even harder to know what the norm for someone is.\n\nYou paid and apologized for assuming.  However, she's an AH for calling you an AH via text, and you're an AH for saying she shouldn't expect someone to pay for something she can't afford when it's a dinner date.

I know the price is a little steep so we can go somewhere else if you prefer not to spend so much\" etc, then she wouldn't know that you're also pointing out the price.

And you DID pick it. Regardless of whether you insist it was a \"gentle suggestion,\" you brought up the restaurant you ultimately went to, so you picked it. \n\nBefore the date is when you should clarify the expectations for the bill, not during, and I think you could have saved yourself and your date a lot of headache with some communication. She shouldn't have assumed you'd pay, yes, but you also shouldn't have assumed you'd split the bill, and I think you have a little more responsibility to clarify since the place you went to was both on the expensive side and your idea. Ultimately even if I think you're in the wrong more in this instance that doesn't mean you're a bad person overall, and I think this is a good lesson in remembering that what may be obvious to you may not be obvious to someone else, so you should always make things clear especially when you don't know them well yet.", "INFO: How much is \"I admit I was a little annoyed\" doing in that sentence?

She also should have addressed this, maybe by saying something like \"wow, this looks like a great place, but it's on the pricey end- are we splitting the bill or is this your treat?\" Another option is trying more casual places for early dates, that way splitting the bill, or paying the whole thing, are easier propositions.", "ESH, but she sucks slightly more for attacking you after you paid for her meal.

Just seems like a blunder on both parties end. \n\nIf someone suggested a fancy restaurant, I would assume perhaps they wanted to take me out on a nice date. I may not suggest a change in venue of the man seemed set on it. \n\nAlso mentioning you won't be paying for the full tab upfront and say, hey, I'd like to split the bill and wanted to make sure this was alright with you.  You might get some women who don't like that and cancel but then you've weeded out the L's anyway, if that is the hill OP wants to die on. Bringing it up at the tail end of a date isn't ideal.", "Yeah I\u2019m really surprised at some of the responses here. I always thought that it was standard dating etiquette for the person extending the invitation to pay for the date, gender regardless. \n\nIf *you* invite someone on a date, and it\u2019s *your idea* that *you* initiate and *you* select the restaurant/event, *you* should expect to pay for the whole date unless you discuss an alternative with the person prior to the event. Your date is a guest on the outing with you.", "You're absolutely right. The annoyance only lasted for a few seconds, and it was mainly due to the miscommunication than anything else. I did my best not to show it, however it's impossible to know what nonverbals I gave off in those few seconds. I can completely understand why she'd be so upset if she thought I was annoyed she couldn't afford to eat at a nice restaurant, and I'll definitely resolve to communicate better in the future. Thank you for your response.", "Right! Why would you pick such an expensive restaurant for a first date. I went on plenty of app first dates before I eventually met my husband. They were always a bar, wine bar, coffee, very rarely a more casual restaurant but nothing more extravagant than that. I never paid, but I also never ordered excessively. You are the one who got yourself into this situation.", "I did pick one once and it worked out. I chose my favorite restaurant and it\u2019s not exactly cheap. I then proceeded to pay the entire bill, because it was my idea. I think it\u2019s ok if it\u2019s not $$$$$, more like $$$ and the date is promising. We\u2019re married now. It\u2019s rude for him to pick it and then not pay.", "Agree! Date or not, if you want to have company at an expensive restaurant, then you foot the bill. I\u2019m a Michelin star chaser, and when I was on a trip with friends I picked up the tab because **I** wanted the experience. Stinginess is an unbecoming trait.", "Agree. She suggested they meet up, OP suggested both dinner and the expensive restaurant.", "Yeah go out for drinks (alcohol, coffee, water) or somewhere to talk. My now husband and I went for a hike on our first date and then we continued the date from there.", "Exactly, same scenario. Never paid for a first date, always offered and it was never accepted by the guy. \n\nKind of silly to take a girl to an expensive restaurant on a first date anyway. And ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re not okay with paying the whole bill and assuming she\u2019s gonna be on board with splitting with no prior discussion. \n\nIf I were the girl I would pay for my meal to avoid embarrassment (even if it overdrafted my account, I have too much pride) and then never called the guy again honestly.", ">It is commonly assumed that the person who asks out and suggests the restaurant is the one that will pay the bill,\n\nThis is not the case where I'm from and I really can't understand this way of thinking but I'm curious. \n\nIn this case she asked him out but he suggested the restaurant because she didn't know where she wanted to go. \n\nSo who would have to pay according to these \"common\" rules?", "The assumptions are not equal though. The assumption that one pays for what they order and consume is much more grounded than the assumption that I don't have to pay for what I order and consume because we both agreed on a date.", "I also just came from that post and got a little confused lmao.", "I just read that before this lmao they should switch partners", "I always assume I'm paying for myself unless it's specifically stated. So I order what I know I can cover.", "Agreed, coffee or drinks can extend, but a disastrous dinner cam feel like a lifetime and has a high pressure vibe.", "This is a good answer.  I think about the chewing gum commercial where the couple is on a first date.  The waiter asks if they want to split the check.

I never would expect the person I asked to offer to grab the tip, I fully expect to pay for the entire meal for us both. Obviously I view those people as polite and well mannered that tip for us or pay for our next outing. I have been asked out by men who asked to split the bill last minute when I ordered a $9 salad or a $12 sandwich. Maybe they weren\u2019t into me or maybe they legitimately didn\u2019t want to pay for my food I\u2019m really not sure but I was a bit thrown off by it either way.

Meeting the lady off of Tinder doesn't change that. \n\nGoing 50/50 isn't unreasonable. In some cases it takes a lot of pressure off of the lady.

It\u2019s not necessarily the man, though in this case it was.", "Thank you, I completely agree. It seems like a pretty straightforward issue.", "Awarded.  Making assumptions at the first date is asshattery - everyone should pay their way unless other arrangements are agreed upon.", "Just read the same one, she asked to split cuz guy was ordering so much. Slightly different but still suspicious.", "Yes. Your last sentence! OP sounds so judgmental and classist. Ugh. All these comments saying they are both wrong.

No way...  no one should ever go out and just assume the other person will cover it.\n\nIt's not like he said \"I'd love to treat you to dinner at this restaurant I love\".  They had a mutal and egalitarian discussion about where to meet.  \n\nWhy didn't she say \"That restaurant is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Maybe something more low-key?\" and suggest somewhere else?

That\u2019s why communication prior to the date is important (to have a basic idea whom you are dating).", "and any man that refuses or gets offended by a woman insisting on splitting the cost for dates is not worth dating, so it\u2019s a good filtering technique.", "Yes, I wouldn't expect someone paying my part just because they choose the plan.", "THIS. In my relationship, my boyfriend paid for our very first date just because he wanted to and then after that whoever invited or set up the date paid for it. I think it shows then we\u2019re actually treating each other rather than have a nice date and pay a separate bill like we\u2019re treating ourselves.

It's just an unfortunate combination of lacking communication and incompatible ideologies. \n\nPersonally speaking, I'm always prepared to split the tab if needed, but it is mildly offensive to me to have to. \n\nI lean closer to traditional ideals where a man paying for me signifies his interest, and choosing to pay for myself signifies lack-of \n\nThis doesn't mean I won't drop $150 dollars on tickets for the follow-up date, but it is definitely unattractive to me when a man doesn't default to treating you on the first. \n\nBasically, I view first dates who go dutch as dinner buddies unless I've go lt a strong reason to still be attracted to them/we've been talking for some time.", "He's also the one who suggested dinner. Coffee exists.", "Yes!! NTA OP. \n\nI don\u2019t know why this person assumed you would pay for them... I thought we were past the days of gender-based bill paying.

You are not responsible for their assumptions or their feelings.", "That\u2019s just so outdated and not true.

The sexism is intense here.", "Most of the Y T A responses are saying it's about the fact that the man did the inviting in this instance, rather than an expectation that the man pays in general. It's not a sexist opinion it's about differing views on manners. It's interesting how widely these opinions vary, and of course, all of this could be prevented with clear communication.

Early in the dating game, it's either going to be a split or the guy pays - there's a ton of factors that determine which one (including who picks the place), but those are the two most popular options.\n\nBased on your rule, a woman who picks the place will be expected to pay the full bill.

You invited someone out to dinner or lunch or whatever, so you pay unless they offer to cover their half, which you can accept, or you can tell them they can cover the next time. \n\nI use this for friend dates too. If I invite a friend out then I will offer to cover their meal too. Especially if you pick an expensive restaurant.

I don't think you're a complete AH, especially if you're young. It's just a learning curve. But she felt embarrassed which I can understand, that is a super awkward position to find yourself in.

It\u2019s still assuming they are following this rule when they may always expect the other person to pay for themselves, regardless of who invited who.
