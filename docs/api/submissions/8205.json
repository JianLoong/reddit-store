I mqde it clear to her that she could stay here until the pregnancy is done (provided she handle all the entails on her own) but that she and my grandchiod won't be coming here from the hospital. She left the day after that, and after a few phonecalls begging me to reconsider I blocked her number.\n\nYesterday my ex-wife (42F) calls me chewing me out for \"disowning\" my daughter. I mare it clear I'm not doing that, once she stops harrasing me to let her move back in I'll happily stay in touch. But she's an adult and I have no obligation to let her stay in my home. Apparently my daughter is staying with her mother, and provided she works she'll help her out. I can't imagine why, she isn't obligated to do that but her perrogative. I want my daughter to accept that she is an adult and needs to take care of herself, and this won't help.

Last week, she told me that she was pregnant. I don't believe I should have to have any part in raising my granchild, I did my part as a father. I mqde it clear to her that she could stay here until the pregnancy is done (provided she handle all the entails on her own) but that she and my grandchiod won't be coming here from the hospital. She left the day after that, and after a few phonecalls begging me to reconsider I blocked her number.\n\nYesterday my ex-wife (42F) calls me chewing me out for \"disowning\" my daughter. I mare it clear I'm not doing that, once she stops harrasing me to let her move back in I'll happily stay in touch. But she's an adult and I have no obligation to let her stay in my home. Apparently my daughter is staying with her mother, and provided she works she'll help her out. I can't imagine why, she isn't obligated to do that but her perrogative. I want my daughter to accept that she is an adult and needs to take care of herself, and this won't help. I decided to unblock my daughter, but since I haven't heard from her I guess we're done.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Of course, you probably did your best and worked your ass off for the last 18 years to feed her and dress her.  And, that deserves a lot of credit.

What kind of practical advice and guidance did you provide her about safe sex, birth control, intimacy, and family planning?

No it isn't your responsibility to house her, but you do need to be there for her to lean on if she needs it. That's what a parent is for. Since you aren't keen on housing her, educate and help her figure out other options. Being 18 she probably doesn't know what's out there.

S/", "If he even did that much.", "This is the way right here.", "I love your dad \u2764\ufe0f", "Wow. Much love to you. What a you g age. So glad you had support. :)", "Awww your story is so much like my own, right down to the ages of me and the kiddo. \n\nMy Dad was the person I feared telling the most, but he ended up being the most supportive. \n\nIt really does take a village and that approach made for a very happy and loved child.  \n\nI'm glad everything worked out for you and still is to this day \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI don't know what I would have done without my parents, but with them I managed to go back to school, get a great job, and build an impressive career where I'm now in a position to take care of myself and rarely need anything from them. \n\nOP YTA. You don't have to let her live there but it wouldn't kill you to be supportive. I built genuine memories with my Dad when he would take me and the baby to Costco for some essentials he noticed I was running out of or when he would come over to install baby gates. I feel sad for you that you don't know what you're missing by being unsupportive", "Dollars to doughnuts he\u2019s an \u201caccept the consequences of your terrible decisions\u201d guy.", "Oh yeah from the sound of it I doubt he was all that involved with her prior to her becoming a legal adult too.", "I think you\u2019d win that bet", "He probably told her no to birth control too. Many parents just expect their curious teenagers to stay abstinent while vilifying sex. Not even high school offers resources in regards to sex beyond \"stay abstinent\".", "Naaa judging from the attitude they are giving its even darker than that.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rage. He sounds clinical. Like he has absolutely no emotion", "Fathers like that disown daughters for a lot less. Happened to me. She is better off without him.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think he ever wanted a child with how cold the post is written. Being a parent doesn\u2019t end at 18.", "He chooses his own nursing home. What do you think people without children do?  Parents don\u2019t owe their lives to their children. That said OP is harsh in his description of events. He\u2019s either uncaring or his daughter is not responsible and he knows where this is headed.", "Which is also hilarious bc if he is early 40\u2019s he was not that much older than his daughter is when he had her!", "He might need the help of his family once he gets older. Well, he can hope that he doesn't get old.", "Sperm donor", "Oops!Thanks!", "Are you an \"asshole aficionado\" because you're an asshole yourself?", "Thanks for the judgement, but kindly fuck off. I'm extremely happy with my life and you have no idea about pOoR cHoIcEs or anything else you're talking about. Parents should support their children regardless.", "Oh my bad, I re read and he did say she hasn't graduated yet. THAT'S EVEN WORSE. Op, you're a major ah dad. Hope you can live with that, my dude.", "She had sex not living on her own the consequences  for her having  sex and getting  pregnant  was being kicked out  by someone  that's obviously  doesn't agree  with her being pregnant  she not living on her own  she doesn't  have a place to go except  her parents  people  have sex and this the consequence   she laid down  she has to deal with being kicked out", "He says: \"so I guess we're done\" like he is breaking up with a fling. What a moron.", "The story gets even better.  My dad was there for every pregnancy craving, ones I forgot I even had.  Like one night I thought a root beer float would be great but we didn't have the things.  It passed.  I forgot about it.  The next day I get home from work and my dad greats me at the door with a root beer float. 'I couldn't get the idea of floats out of my head all day at work so I bought the supplies on the way home' \n\nI had a somewhat higher risk pregnancy despite my young age and my doc recommended water aerobics.  My dad went with me.  Me, him, and a dozen women over the age of 60.  Lol.  \n\nHe left work immediately when I was in labor, but respected my privacy to not be in the room, my mom was my labor person.  In hindsight I wouldn't have cared if he saw the whole show cause labor be like that, but he stood outside the curtain thing and my most vivid memory of my labor was him like an ESPN play caller 'I think she is pushing, okay, she is pushing now, okay I think it's time' then my daughter is born, cries, 'I hear her crying! My granddaughter is here!' \n\nAnd then he went to chic fil a at my request and got like 20 milkshakes for the nursing staff lol.  \n\nThe man is a saint.", "I know not everyone is maybe financially capable of supporting younger pregnancies but even emotional support counts for a lot.", "after shaping the circumstances which led to the decisions in questions. depressingly common parent behavior", "Sounds like the \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" boomer mentality. Just because he may have been able to get through tough times doesn't mean his daughter can- this generation is living in a huge wage and resource gap. I feel for the poor daughter.", "Zero. This kind of apathy and narcissism is quite rare. And frightening. I hope that sweet girl never looks back.", "Depends on how coherent he is when the time comes. My grandpa was not in a state to make the decision for himself and my mom had to choose it for him. Your kids are gonna if you can\u2019t.", "The way he wrote everything out I thought he was one of those older parents that had babies in their mid 40s\u2026 he sounds like a boomer not a millennial. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine leaving my teenage daughter to fend for herself and forcing her and a grandchild into a life of poverty.", "Old and alone...", "I was trying to yell at OP, not you- so sorry! I\u2019m older and not great at Reddit.", "Your dad sounds like an absolute gem! Give him an extra hug from his new reddit fan for just being him!", "This is what love looks like. I hope he knows what a treasure he is.", "Tearing up at this. \ud83e\udd7a I love your dad.", "Right? But he\u2019s 40, the beginning of the Millennial era. What he is, based off his post, is a misogynist AH \u201cfather\u201d", "He's 40.  He's a millenial, not a boomer.  He's just an asshole.  I doubt he's ever been there for his daughter ever in her entire life.", "I got the exact impression! If he is in his 40s then dude is emotionally detached from EVERYTHING. Makes sense why he is also divorced.", "At this rate no one will know he's dead until a neighbor complains about the smell months - years later and his desiccated corpse is found alone and forgotten, surrounded by shallow meaningless relics of a miserable life.", "No, I got that! You're good! Op is a major d*k. I'm still new to reddit too!"]}
