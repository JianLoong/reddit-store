Always the top of her class, excelled at extracurriculars, put herself through college on scholarships and part-time work, and moved to NYC essentially by herself right after graduation for a great job.\n\nWhen she was growing up, we got by, but were never rich. Emily never wanted for anything, but we did put a lot on credit cards to make ends meet for her. But since Emily left home, she has been entirely financially independent, and my wife and I both got significant promotions and now make about double what we did when Emily was a kid.\n\nI think important context is that my wife loves Emily, obviously, but is jealous of her. Emily is bright and achieves things effortlessly. She\u2019s never not gotten something she\u2019s wanted or gone after--sometimes because of us, and sometimes because she's just driven and bright. Emily, now 26, is in the top graduate program in her field. She got a full scholarship that covers tuition, but because it\u2019s New York, that doesnt mean much, so she pays for living expenses by maintaining her full-time job.\n\nThe other day, Emily called us very upset, saying the program had changed a requirement, and she would now be required to take classes next semester only offered at normal work hours \u2013 meaning she\u2019d have to quit her job to take the classes required. Overall, she\u2019d be on the hook for probably about $10,000, assuming she got another job right when she graduated.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask us for money, just seemed frazzled and upset. In response, my wife said, \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re not calling because you think we\u2019ll give you the money. We can't do that for you.\u201d Emily\u2019s voice changed, and she said very coolly, \u201cI wasn't. I'm sure I'll figure it out. Thank you for listening,\u201d and got off the phone.\n\nI was angry, because we absolutely had enough money to support Emily through one semester of school. She\u2019d been financially independent for almost eight years and had never asked us for anything. I later called Emily privately to tell her that if she needed money, we could more than spare it. She thanked me, but said she hadn\u2019t called to ask for money, only comfort, and she would figure it out.\n\nMy wife is furious and says I undermined her by offering Emily money. I disagree, because we keep separate accounts, and this would have come from mine, so I didn\u2019t break any \u201crules\u201d by offering our joint money. But she thinks I'm TA for making her look bad, and that she would have absolutely given it if Emily had asked.\n\nI think that she is being TA because sure, i have no doubt my wife would have given Emily the money--but she just wanted her to grovel for it. It's almost like she wanted to see how low Emily would stoop before she offered to bail her out.  Our kid called us because she needed her parents and my wife cut her off before she could even let us support her.\n\nAITA for offering the money when my wife said we wouldn\u2019t?", "created_utc": 1671819895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztozfu/aita_for_offering_to_support_my_adult_daughter/", "score": 604, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then her explanation to you is that she\u2019s setting the stage, to be sure that she can attach all the strings to the \u201chelp\u201d that she will deign to give once her daughter is crushed enough to accept the poison pill.\n\nI suspect this is a familiar pattern, and is exactly why your daughter has been independent as soon as she could.\n\nMy ex was the same, and for the same reason. He told me that she could be \u201cgenerous\u201d but that every gift had strings attached to try to control him again. He rejected every gift outside of small tchotchkes because of this.

She\u2019s probably not going to take it well, after all she\u2019s used to you guys just accepting her bad behavior and tip toeing around it.

And that's important in a marriage.", "NTA\n\nBut I think you mis stepped a bit with offering the help later. Emily sounds like someone who is very intrinsically motivated and offering her help like that most likely hurt her pride. She\u2019s a very self sufficient person and most likely prides herself strongly on her ability to succeed on her own merit. Offering help like that, although well intended, may have given her the impression that you don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of getting through this without help. Or at the very least, she may have doubled down to \u201cprove\u201d to herself and maybe her parents that she can. \n\nI think you should try talking to her again.

That you\u2019re so proud of how she\u2019s doing in her grad school and you want her to be able to focus on that. \n\nI\u2019m a lot like your daughter and I know that I struggle to accept help because of the effect it can have on my self esteem. I value my independence and self reliance too much to easily accept help.

Try as you might, assure as much as you can, but kids growing up when money is tight very often feel like a burden whenever they need  money. I felt it and it still makes me incredibly hesitant to go to my parents for financial help as small as a short term low dollar loan of a couple weeks even though I logically know they can afford it now. If my mother had said what your wife did when I was venting about money troubles I would have felt like she completely resented me for needing things as a child - like she resented my existence because it was expensive.

My mother used to try to embarrass me in front of guys I was dating, trying to get them on her side. After years of being abused by her and watching her assassinate my character to everyone, I knew exactly what she was doing. Any guy that was like \u2018oh your mum isn\u2019t that bad, she seemed lovely\u2019 when I\u2019d told them what she was like beforehand, got the chop. My now-husband saw right through her when they met though, because he\u2019d had a similar experience with his own mother. She tried to make digs about my appearance in front of him whilst positively comparing herself - and he would interrupt to say how beautiful he thought I was. :)", "If they behave like this to their kid then they are a bad parent regardless of being damaged. \n\nMy mother is damaged due to childhood trauma. She was still a bad parent and is an awful human being. I understand why, but I cannot forgive her.", "This", "My dad told me something when I was leaving for college that I will *never* forget. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re leaving because she will start to pick on me again and you won\u2019t be there for her to focus on.\u201d Ah dad, so you knew about the abuse, you just didn\u2019t care as long as it wasn\u2019t aimed at you?", "NTA. As a graduate student who got extensive support from her parents (more than $100k), I understand Emily and it is great that you are very supportive of your daughter.\n\nYour wife on the other hand is acting like a stereotypical step-mom. If you have separate accounts, it is not up to her to decide whether to give money or not. Also, it is terrible that she made Emily feel unsupported. Grad school is hard as is, I don\u2019t think I could have gotten through it without my parents/husbands support.", "How can you still be married to someone that treats your own child like this? It didn\u2019t just happen overnight. Your child\u2019s entire life Her mother has treated her like this and you have done nothing about it. Do you know what kind of trauma that causes? Maybe you should try to actually have a conversation with your daughter about what her mother has been like her entire life if you care About her.", "NTA your wife has issues.", ">she would have absolutely given her the money if she asked\n\nSure, that's totally believable when you say it 15 mins after saying your daughter \"don't count on us for that money\"\n\nNTA btw", "NTA but you might want to have a talk with your wife soon because if this continues then you're daughter and you will not have a good relationship because of her.\n\nWhy Is she so competitive towards her own kid? That's not healthy or normal and clearly has harmed her relationship with her daughter.\n\nYou need to stand up more when she does stuff like this, in fact show her this post so maybe she understands that this isn't okay and that she might need help professionally.\n\nOr you both could lose your daughter, don't be a enabler.", "I wish you could talk sense into my mom and stepdad!! I've independently (scholarships/small loans) supported myself through undergrad and grad school and my half sister has had everything paid for by my mom and stepdad (3 out of state schools, still no undergrad degree completed) I don't ask for help because I don't feel comfortable asking because the one time I did ask for like 500$ as a loan in college they made this huge deal and it was humiliating, had a vehicle crap out on me and am currently trying to figure something out (they have 4 cars, one is my sister's now and the other three are shared between the two of them) I wish they were as thoughtful as you OP!! NTA", "Dude, your cowardice in advocating for your daughter against your wife will likely end up in her being no contact soon and you being stuck with the monster you enabled. \n\nIn my experience, you do not placate bad behavior from loved ones or it just continues. You shut that crap down. Even if you are doing what you can behind the scenes. \n\nYTA.", "> I have more empathy for Emily now, because I bear the brunt of these moods now that she's moved out.\n\n Wow you suck!!!", "\u201cKind of difficult\u201d dude you\u2019re in an abusive relationship. Seek help for the sake of your daughter.", "Seriously. Hope OP takes a step back and thinks about his child.", "This.", "Uggggggghhhhhhhh so toxic \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e"]}
