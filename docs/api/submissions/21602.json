His name is Colby and he's perfect. My wife and I are obviously tired but very fulfilled and loving every moment of parenthood. However, my wife does get a bit pissed whenever my sister contacts us or comes by to see the baby. It's only my sister, no one else. When I ask my wife about it, she just says she \"can't stand her\". Weird, because she didn't mind my sister before but now even hearing my sister's voice or seeing her car in the driveway sets my wife right sideways. Up until today though I had no idea *why*. \n\nSo my sister shows up here earlier and as I said, it sets my wife off. She goes in the bedroom with our son. Now, my wife is very nonconfrontational. The only time she ever says anything is when she's pushed well beyond her breaking point. Well, my sister starts just talking to me like normal or whatever and didn't even mention my wife or Colby. I go to the restroom maybe 20 minutes later and when I return, I hear my wife becoming snappy. My sister was now in my bedroom and as I approached the door, I hear my sister say \"you need help Clara, just let me help you\". Now, I have no idea what's going on at this point. So I walk in and ask wtf is going on because my wifes face is beat red.\n\nWell, my wife puts Colby in his crib, pushes us out of the room and shuts the door and this is when she unleashes. She said something to the affect of \"your fucking sister seems to think that I have PPD. Your fucking sister seems to think that I need to hand the baby over to her and go check myself in to the hospital because apparently she knows what PPD feels like even though she's never fucking carried a child or given birth\" (my sister is infertile and adopted my niece 13 years ago). My sister starts crying, saying she can \"see the signs\" and is \"just trying to help\". Starts telling me to open my eyes (my wife does not show signs of PPD, she's literally so overjoyed with being a mom). So I told her to pound sand and that she doesn't know anything and to get out and never return and then, in the heat of the moment, said she was no longer allowed around our son because I don't trust her to not kidnap him. Harsh, word vomit. She leaves, crisis diverted. All goes back to normal. But my mom called flipping out because of how we treated my sister and made out like she was less of a mom because she adopted.", "created_utc": 1688759770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14thl00/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_pound_sand_and_that/", "score": 4738, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everything the sister did is at best misguided to an unhealthy degree and at worst sinister. There's no doubt in my mind that she didn't axtually have their best interests at heart. Let's go through this, shall we?\n\n1.) At no point did the sister come to OP with concerns about his wife, which is really suspicious. If you thought your sibling's partner was going through PPD, would you just not mention it to them even though you keep bringing it up to the partner? The fact that OP was completely unaware of this going on just adds to the suspicion. It means the sister deliberately only brought this up to the wife when OP wasn't around to hear the conversation. Why hide it like that? It's basic common sense that a spouse would be the best person to talk their partner into something. Also, if you genuinely thought your sibling's partner was having a mental health crisis to the point that they need to go to a hospital, why would you not tell your sibling something so important?\n\n2.) There was absolutely no need for the sister to go into their bedroom, especially to continue hounding the wife, and bringing up the previous point, it's just another example of the sister blatantly hiding her actions from OP. She waited until OP was gone to sneak into that bedroom. She ambushed the wife in what should have been the safety of her own room while OP was away and couldn't participate in such an important discussion. \n\n3.) Why would the sister suggest to the wife to hand the baby over to her instead of OP? If the mother is incapacitated, the father should look after the baby. And even if the sister's plan was to help OP look after his son, why wouldn't she tell him that before? Let's say she magically convinced the wife to go to the hospital. Was the sister just going to spring it on OP like \"hey bro, your wife's gonna go to the hospital right now for PPD, and now it's just you looking after your kid, but don't worry, I'm here to help even though I didn't tell you a thing about what was going on earlier?\"\n\nEverything the sister did is sketchy as hell.", "I don't think so; if any family member had tried to convince my wife to hand over our baby to them and commit herself to the hospital for PPD, I'd tell them to get out and never come back.

His sister tried to have his wife comitted. That damaged the relationship already.", "Agreed and I'm surprised there are so many NTA votes. It's at least ESH.\n\nI get it, tempers flared and you wanted to protect your distressed wife.

I suspect the wife, either through PPD or her sudden unknown hatred for the sister (or a combination of both) interpreted \"you need some help\" to mean \"hand over the baby.\" \n\nAlso, the weird switch from the wife being angry and upset to perfectly fine minutes later makes me think there are some other things going on with the wife mentally. And speaks of the wife needing help.", "Thank you!  I've do not have children, but I believe that PPD needs to be better understood by the population at large.  And after rereading, I've edited to ESH, I agree that, even though sister was definitely wrong, OP was extremely harsh.", "She didn't say anything, because like OP said, she's conflict-avoidant. Probably already stressed out with a new baby and hoping SIL would just let it go, didn't want to rock the boat by getting her husband involved.\n\nSome people are like that. They'll put up with all manner of crap until it really comes to a head.", "I think it's both. I could definitely see a new mom, feeling extra vulnerable, would have doubts that someone would stand up for her, even her own spouse. Especially if they've spent enough time online. It's not uncommon for spouses to take their family of origin's side in order to \"not rock the boat\". But why did the husband just not question her sudden change in opinion about his sister? He just went \"that's strange\" and moved on with his day, still having her over frequently.", "I'm just over here applauding wildly", "Right, she's definitely got some weirdness going on. And shouldn't be in the house rn.\n\nBut OP knows he went off the deep end by making permanent declarations like \"get out and **never return** and then, in the heat of the moment, said she was **no longer allowed around our son** because I don't trust her to not kidnap him.\"\n\nLike, she probably has some kind of weird transference thing going on with his wife and the baby, since she can't have her own. She needs therapy, not to be cut off entirely. She said some offensive stuff... she did not, in fact, try to kidnap the baby.\n\nIn retrospect, I'm changing my post to \"ESH except the wife.\" You make a fair point. The sister is an AH here, too.", "No she didn't. She told her she needed to get help, that she needed to check herself in, and was being weirdly insistent about it.

Not being an intrusive weirdo is a good start.", "How would you act if someone barges into your bedroom and tells you to check yourself into a mental health hospital?", "Then why tf hasn\u2019t the sister approached the husband? If she was that concerned the logical thing to do would be to reach out to the spouse & father. \n\nI\u2019d be angry too if someone followed me into my room (the second my husband was out of sight) and started harassing me too.", "New parents are tired.  Mom can be very happy with the baby, not showing signs of any PPD, and functioning fine in her daily baby activities..... and then being tired can absolutely make you lose your shit when an obnoxious know-it-all keeps barging in and getting in your face.   Guess what happens when the problem leaves?   So does the frustration and anger over wanting them to be gone.", "I initially jumped completely the other way and put all the blame on OP, but a few commenters helped me reassess that, too, and I agree it's definitely ESH.", "[deleted]", "Very fair, except the OP said he was worried she might try to kidnap the baby, not that she did try. She was trying to get the sister to hand over their child, so I'd have the same worry if I were in his shoes.

I may have misread you.", "OP didn't say he was worried she might try to kidnap the baby. He's not using that to justify his behavior.\n\nHe told his sister that, in anger, and then specifically labeled that \"word vomit.\" It does not appear that he's *actually* worried about that possibility.\n\n\"No contact until you get some help\" is still fairer than \"get out forever.\"", "No, and I said as much, that he was justified in telling her to leave.\n\nIt's interesting that you introduced the word \"guilty\" there, though.\n\nWhat I said is that he went overboard by making it permanent.", "Yes, he may have said it in anger, but given she was trying to get his wife to give away their baby and commit herself to a mental hospital, he SHOULD worry about her trying to actually steal the baby.", ">OP didn't say he was worried she might try to kidnap the baby.

If your sister has been made to feel like she\u2019s somehow less of a mother because she adopted, perhaps it\u2019s because she has made *herself* to feel that way, without anyone else\u2019s help. Perhaps the sister should check *herself* into a mental hospital and get herself figured out.\n\nAt minimum she could try therapy. Adoptive parenting is just as valid as bio parenting, but it\u2019s also valid for her to have grief and/or inadequacy feelings surrounding it.", "NTA. Holy crap\u2026 the assumption that if your wife was in need of inpatient medical treatment she would automatically hand the baby over to your sister when you are literally the baby\u2019s father is unreal. I wouldn\u2019t allow her near either your wife or the baby from now on.", "You didn't make her feel less like a mom because she adopted. You pointed out the FACT that she didn't carry the child or give birth, so she would have no idea what PPD feels like, or the hormonal changes that occur post-birth. That is a FACT, not an insult. People need to learn the difference.\n\nNTA. She was way out of line.", "NTA. your sister doesn't appear to be a medical professional but she is telling ONLY YOUR WIFE that she has PPD. She doesn't mention it to you. She harasses your wife every time she sees her and people think you are the AH?

Don't let her near your family.", "I'm honestly concerned your sister might try to kidnap your child or call in a fraudulent report to CPS. You need to get ahead of this before something happens to your child and family. Get outdoor and indoor cameras that document everything. Make sure all of your doors and windows lock and that your sister has no access to a key. Get new locks if you have to and make sure the only people with keys are you and your wife. Considering your mom's reaction, I wouldn't be surprised if she gave your sister a new copy of your house key. Document EVERYTHING. All texts, phone calls, in person interactions, etc. with your sister and possibly even mother.\n\n\n\n\nI would also consider consulting a lawyer and having them send a cease and desist letter to your sister. You may want to call your local CPS division and warn them that your sister may try to call in a false report on you and your wife. Ask them for guidance on how to handle a potentially dangerous relative. I'd also consider calling the police non-emergency line and letting the authorities know that you're concerned your sister might try to kidnap or harm your child. While they can't do anything, having them at least document your sister as a potential threat will help if she does try anything. Finally, if your sister doesn't leave you alone, consider getting a temporary no contact or restraining order.\n\n\n\nFinally, you may want to inform your wife's doctor(s) of what's going on so, should your sister try to get your child taken away, they can provide documentation to the police, CPS, etc. that your wife is mentally and physically stable.\n\n\nYou are NTA but you have an obligation to protect your wife and child from your sister.", "NTA. I think you're not giving yourself credit by saying your words were too harsh. Why would she be telling your wife to hand over the baby to *her*? Even if your wife had to be hospitalized (not saying she does, I mean hypothetically here), why the hell would the baby be given to her and not just stay with you? If your sister was genuinely concerned, she could have gone to you to say she was worried about your wife. But instead, she's secretly trying to get her to hand the baby over to her without you knowing/when you're not present. Super alarming. \n\n\nThis is super concerning and I wouldn't trust her with the baby either.", "NTA at all. And your concern about her kidnapping the child is incredibly valid.", "Wtf.

Adoption is a long drawn out legal process, you can't just yet a baby out of someone's arms without there being a riot. Also, yes, this is hella disturbing actions by the SIL and I agree she needs to be kept well away from mam and baby, and MIL needs to be on the naughty step for a while. \n\nHowever,  we have one part of the story and must consider the possibility there is a psychological component at play for SIL.

It\u2019s especially weird to come to that conclusion if they had no interpersonal issues prior to the birth. There is no evidence, based on the information given, that the sister was gaslighting.", "ohhh", "I can't understand it. It's beyond me she wouldn't tell OP and expect his firm backup. OP doesn't seem like he's accustomed her to taking bs from his family. But something's going on.", "I\u2019m betting wife has a legit reason for fearing conflict somewhere in there.", "Classic manipulator move. The fuckers.", "Classic reactive abuse", "There are so many details that just going off the story, sister clearly has issues and didn't even deny the statements.\n\nAnd yet people insist that op is an ass and that the sister is trying to help.\n\nIf she was trying to help, why not tell op her concerns? Why wait until op was out of sight to start pressuring? Why full commitment and not seeing a therapist every so often? Why not should op's wife hand over her child?", "Saying that she sees the signs when there are no signs\u2026is being deceptive.", "Sister: Don't you remember? You told me you thought you had PPD.\n\nMother: I didn't say that! I'm perfectly happy!\n\nSister: Oh, sweetheart, this is so sad. I feel so bad for you. Look, you did say that, and then you went to the doctor and had it confirmed. She said you might have some memory gaps. Does any of this sound familiar?\n\nMother: No, no it doesn't. What are you talking about?\n\nSister: Look, if I take the baby, everything will be OK. You can trust me that far and we can agree on that, right? That way you can be looked at and you'll know the baby is safe.\n\n\\^\\^Gaslighting.\n\nEdit: I should add that I do not think that my version is remotely what happened. I am just imagining a similar scenario with actual gaslighting.\n\nEdit Again: And I also agree that the actual situation is gaslighting as well, just not particularly adept or nuanced gaslighting.", "There was a movie called Gaslight...it's how the term came about and the movie was about a husband who was trying to convince his wife that she was going crazy by making her crazy.", "Exactly! Why wouldn\u2019t she say to her own brother, \u2018Hey, I think maybe your wife needs some help because I\u2019ve noticed \\[concerning behaviour\\].\u2019 Also, I know nothing about the treatment for PPD, but I\u2019d be surprised if \u2018check into a mental hospital\u2019 was a standard first step. My assumption would be the first is something like \u2018raise concerns with your GP\u2019 unless there\u2019s a serious risk of imminent harm to mum or baby, which doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s the case here.", "The wife was freaking out at the mere sound of the sister\u2019s car.  It\u2019s wild to me both that the wife never mentioned the reason why\u2026and that OP was never curious enough to ask.", "Yup", ">If she was trying to help, why not tell op her concerns? Why wait until op was out of sight to start pressuring? Why full commitment and not seeing a therapist every so often? Why should op's wife hand over her child?\n\nThese are the questions OP should be asking sister in front of her flying monkeys.

Everyone needs all the therapy.", "You forgot to add in the words \"red flags all over the place\" and call someone/anyone a \"narcissist\".  HTH", "Exactly. This sub in particular is a perfect example of random, uninformed people going straight to nuclear responses.", "Welcome to Tiktok \"SIL called me fat\"\nDIVORCE!!\nDIVORCE!!", "Lol", "Don't forget to hit the lawyer and burn down the gym too... or something.", "Probably best if OP also delete fb and hit the gym too just to be safe", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I second you on this. I specialize in treating abuse victims. This is classic gaslighting.", "He Didn\u2019t use the gas light to make her think she was crazy.  The man constantly undermined his wife making her feel crazy or constantly making her question herself and her own memory so that she would be dependent on him.\n\nThe literal gas light that was flickering was the clue/proof/side effect of him sneaking around upstairs looking for jewels in her deceased aunts (whom he killed) storage while his wife thought he was out.", "When the upstairs gas lights were lit, the downstairs gas lights would dim because there was more gas being used at once. Because they were literally run on Natural gas. He was also walking around up there in the attic and moving her things around so that she would look forgetful in front of others.", "Yes. Tricking her and lying about the lights.     \nIn which way has the sister tricked or lied to the wife?", "It's not gaslighting the way it went down though. That one sentence that we are privvy to. If what was happening was the way you outlined it, that would be gaslighting, definitely agree.", "Thank you! The word gaslighting is so often incorrectly thrown around on Reddit, and this thread proves that many people have no idea what it means.", "Sister hasn't pulled any tricks or told any lies to the wife. She's just pushing her weird opinion on her.    \nIf she says 'but you told me yourself you have PPD' then that'd be gaslighting. Just being pushy that she thinks wife has ppd isn't gaslighting.", "I've had PPD/PPA -- not the most out of sorts one could be but pretty bad -- and step one was medication and suggested therapy. Like, I was even upfront that I had intrusive thoughts about harming my kids, and no one's first step was, \"you're gonna have to surrender your baby and go to the hospital.\" \n\nSo even if sister wasn't full of shit about this PPD thing in this instance, my understanding and experience is that they don't get that drastic about inpatient treatment unless they suspected it's leading into postpartum psychosis.", "IMHO the important thing is that the intention of the sister is to make the wife question her emotional and mental stability. That is what causes it to be gaslighting, even though it isn't working. \n\nThe moment she started, the sister was engaging in gaslighting. The success or failure of the act does not change what it is.", "I'm English, we don't really do therapy here, I always wonder when I read this thread, is everyone in the US seeing a therapist? Is it really that common?", "To be fair, most people would probably benefit from therapy.", "That\u2019s an unfair comparison because everyone could benefit therapy. The appropriate Reddit response is divorce your spouse, go no-contact with your other immediate family members, and call CPS.", "Thank you for not mentioning marinara sauce etc. People flogging those dead horses makes me cringe. It was funny the first time, but people over using it gives me second hand embarrassment fr them.", "You know people keep telling me subtlety isn't one of my strong points but maybe I'm actually TOO subtle!", "This may sound weird, but do you use that screen name somewhere else? I swear I've seen it before, and it's not exactly common. Feel free to DM the answer if you want.", "gaslighting is not about the tricking and lying..those are the manipulation devices usually used in an attempt to make another person think they\u2019re losing their mental faculties, thus making them easier to control, and *that* is gaslighting.", "In its barest form, gaslighting is manipulating someone into believing they're the ones who are unreasonable or insane when that isn't the case. The way it went down, the sister told the new mother that she had PPD, which is a form of trying to convince her that she is the one with the problem. There's no nuance to it and it's easy to cut right through it, but I'd say the original way it went down is at least bad gaslighting. ;)", "The fact that she's only doing it when the husband isn't there suggests to me that she was trying to gaslight her. She's trying to tell the husband that the signs are there, when he, who lives with her, says they're not. She's pushing the wife to her limit then saying, \"see? This is why you need help! Let me help you!\" That is, indeed, a form of gaslighting. Just because she's not tricking her by moving things around or saying things she pretends to not say doesn't mean she's not gaslighting. \n\nIf the husband wouldn't have walked in, he would have continued to wonder what was happening to his wife and why she had such a visceral reaction to the sister, which means that the sister probably had her feeling scared and paranoid that if she told her husband what was happening, either the sister would deny it and she'd look crazy, or her husband would agree with the sister, because the sister had consistently pounded it in her head that she was losing it and needed help.\n\nIt's the combination of all factors in this story combined that suggest that the sister was absolutely trying to gaslight the wife.", "We all WANT to be in therapy, given the state of everything. But most of us can't afford it. Or insurance doesn't cover it. Not that it matters, because we can't afford to take time off work for therapy appointments anyway.", "I just use it for Reddit but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if others used something similar. Maybe you recognize me from another subreddit?", "There has to be manipulation. Otherwise gaslighting = repeatedly telling someone what I think of them", "The more likely scenario is the sister would have been slipping hints to her brother about his wife. If this was a deliberate gaslighting attempt. I think SIL is just crazed.", "I agree. As for my calling it \"bad gaslighting,\" I'd say this:\n\n\"My sister starts crying, saying she can \"see the signs\" and is \"just trying to help\". Starts telling me to open my eyes\"\n\nqualifies as a poor attempt to manipulate. \"Open your eyes!\" I'd also guess, with, granted, no hard evidence from the post, that the mention of the wife being upset from multiple past talks with the sister probably amounted to repeated attempts to convince her, poorly, that she was suffering from PPD.\n\nIt also isn't just someone telling someone else what they think of them...she's telling her what her reality is, even though there's no evidence of this alternate reality.\n\nAt some point, it's semantics, which is fine. We need semantics. I just think there's enough manipulation to at least call it shyte gaslighting. But yes, that's also why I gave the example of gaslighting which is, perhaps, a bit of an easier call."]}
