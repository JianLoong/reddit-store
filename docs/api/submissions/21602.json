His name is Colby and he's perfect. My wife and I are obviously tired but very fulfilled and loving every moment of parenthood. However, my wife does get a bit pissed whenever my sister contacts us or comes by to see the baby. It's only my sister, no one else. When I ask my wife about it, she just says she \"can't stand her\". Weird, because she didn't mind my sister before but now even hearing my sister's voice or seeing her car in the driveway sets my wife right sideways. Up until today though I had no idea *why*. \n\nSo my sister shows up here earlier and as I said, it sets my wife off. She goes in the bedroom with our son. Now, my wife is very nonconfrontational. The only time she ever says anything is when she's pushed well beyond her breaking point. Well, my sister starts just talking to me like normal or whatever and didn't even mention my wife or Colby. I go to the restroom maybe 20 minutes later and when I return, I hear my wife becoming snappy. My sister was now in my bedroom and as I approached the door, I hear my sister say \"you need help Clara, just let me help you\". Now, I have no idea what's going on at this point. So I walk in and ask wtf is going on because my wifes face is beat red.\n\nWell, my wife puts Colby in his crib, pushes us out of the room and shuts the door and this is when she unleashes. She said something to the affect of \"your fucking sister seems to think that I have PPD. Your fucking sister seems to think that I need to hand the baby over to her and go check myself in to the hospital because apparently she knows what PPD feels like even though she's never fucking carried a child or given birth\" (my sister is infertile and adopted my niece 13 years ago). My sister starts crying, saying she can \"see the signs\" and is \"just trying to help\". Starts telling me to open my eyes (my wife does not show signs of PPD, she's literally so overjoyed with being a mom). So I told her to pound sand and that she doesn't know anything and to get out and never return and then, in the heat of the moment, said she was no longer allowed around our son because I don't trust her to not kidnap him. Harsh, word vomit. She leaves, crisis diverted. All goes back to normal. But my mom called flipping out because of how we treated my sister and made out like she was less of a mom because she adopted.", "created_utc": 1688759770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14thl00/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_pound_sand_and_that/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everything the sister did is at best misguided to an unhealthy degree and at worst sinister. There's no doubt in my mind that she didn't axtually have their best interests at heart. Let's go through this, shall we?\n\n1.) At no point did the sister come to OP with concerns about his wife, which is really suspicious. If you thought your sibling's partner was going through PPD, would you just not mention it to them even though you keep bringing it up to the partner? The fact that OP was completely unaware of this going on just adds to the suspicion. It means the sister deliberately only brought this up to the wife when OP wasn't around to hear the conversation. Why hide it like that? It's basic common sense that a spouse would be the best person to talk their partner into something. Also, if you genuinely thought your sibling's partner was having a mental health crisis to the point that they need to go to a hospital, why would you not tell your sibling something so important?\n\n2.) There was absolutely no need for the sister to go into their bedroom, especially to continue hounding the wife, and bringing up the previous point, it's just another example of the sister blatantly hiding her actions from OP. She waited until OP was gone to sneak into that bedroom. She ambushed the wife in what should have been the safety of her own room while OP was away and couldn't participate in such an important discussion. \n\n3.) Why would the sister suggest to the wife to hand the baby over to her instead of OP? If the mother is incapacitated, the father should look after the baby. And even if the sister's plan was to help OP look after his son, why wouldn't she tell him that before? Let's say she magically convinced the wife to go to the hospital. Was the sister just going to spring it on OP like \"hey bro, your wife's gonna go to the hospital right now for PPD, and now it's just you looking after your kid, but don't worry, I'm here to help even though I didn't tell you a thing about what was going on earlier?\"\n\nEverything the sister did is sketchy as hell.", "I don't think so; if any family member had tried to convince my wife to hand over our baby to them and commit herself to the hospital for PPD, I'd tell them to get out and never come back. The sister clearly needs mental help badly.", "He went too far?? Not the woman who tried to have her SIL comitted and take her baby?? How is op the one that went too far?? Jesus fucking christ, you make no sense", "His sister was trying to get his wife to give her their baby and check into the hospital for PPD, of course he banned her from the house, she clearly needs mental help.", "Lol, what??? His sister tried to have his wife comitted. That damaged the relationship already.", "Agreed and I'm surprised there are so many NTA votes. It's at least ESH.\n\nI get it, tempers flared and you wanted to protect your distressed wife. But those words were far too extreme for the situation.\n\n> It's on YOU to control your temper and watch what you say when you're angry.\n\nExactly.", "I really do not think it is \"throwing her infertility in her face\" to make the plain factual statement that a woman who has never given birth does NOT know how PPD \"feels. \"", ">Your wife, in the heat of the moment, very insensitively threw this in her face.\n\nAfter this woman tried to take her kid from her and have her comitted.", "I don't think the sister actually said that. I suspect the wife, either through PPD or her sudden unknown hatred for the sister (or a combination of both) interpreted \"you need some help\" to mean \"hand over the baby.\" \n\nAlso, the weird switch from the wife being angry and upset to perfectly fine minutes later makes me think there are some other things going on with the wife mentally. And speaks of the wife needing help.", "Thank you!  I've do not have children, but I believe that PPD needs to be better understood by the population at large.  And after rereading, I've edited to ESH, I agree that, even though sister was definitely wrong, OP was extremely harsh.", "She didn't say anything, because like OP said, she's conflict-avoidant. Probably already stressed out with a new baby and hoping SIL would just let it go, didn't want to rock the boat by getting her husband involved.\n\nSome people are like that. They'll put up with all manner of crap until it really comes to a head.", "I think it's both. I could definitely see a new mom, feeling extra vulnerable, would have doubts that someone would stand up for her, even her own spouse. Especially if they've spent enough time online. It's not uncommon for spouses to take their family of origin's side in order to \"not rock the boat\". But why did the husband just not question her sudden change in opinion about his sister? He just went \"that's strange\" and moved on with his day, still having her over frequently.", "I'm just over here applauding wildly", "Right, she's definitely got some weirdness going on. And shouldn't be in the house rn.\n\nBut OP knows he went off the deep end by making permanent declarations like \"get out and **never return** and then, in the heat of the moment, said she was **no longer allowed around our son** because I don't trust her to not kidnap him.\"\n\nLike, she probably has some kind of weird transference thing going on with his wife and the baby, since she can't have her own. She needs therapy, not to be cut off entirely. She said some offensive stuff... she did not, in fact, try to kidnap the baby.\n\nIn retrospect, I'm changing my post to \"ESH except the wife.\" You make a fair point. The sister is an AH here, too.", "No she didn't. She told her she needed to get help, that she needed to check herself in, and was being weirdly insistent about it. A shit move, to be sure, but I'm definitely missing the part where she tried to *have her committed*.\n\nIt's weird, but it's not like she called the police or tried to get a court order for treatment.\n\nThat said, I changed it to ESH. Because sister definitely earned her share.", "How does that change what I said? I pointed out it was in the heat of the moment. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that it was insensitive. Two things can be true at once.", "Op... op heard her say it mate.\n\nIt wasn't 'the wife told him she said it'\n\nHe literally overheard that part.", "I think we found the baby stealing sisrer.", "Or speaks of his sister boundary stomping and then creepily cornering his wife in her own bedroom to throw around mental health accusations. \n\nYou don't get to invade the most intimate of personal spaces uninvited and then accuse someone of being unwell for reacting negatively.\n\nIf she was that concerned there are normal and healthy ways to try and help. Not being an intrusive weirdo is a good start.", "How would you act if someone barges into your bedroom and tells you to check yourself into a mental health hospital?", "Then why tf hasn\u2019t the sister approached the husband? If she was that concerned the logical thing to do would be to reach out to the spouse & father. \n\nI\u2019d be angry too if someone followed me into my room (the second my husband was out of sight) and started harassing me too.", "New parents are tired.  Mom can be very happy with the baby, not showing signs of any PPD, and functioning fine in her daily baby activities..... and then being tired can absolutely make you lose your shit when an obnoxious know-it-all keeps barging in and getting in your face.   Guess what happens when the problem leaves?   So does the frustration and anger over wanting them to be gone.", "I initially jumped completely the other way and put all the blame on OP, but a few commenters helped me reassess that, too, and I agree it's definitely ESH.", "[deleted]", "Very fair, except the OP said he was worried she might try to kidnap the baby, not that she did try. She was trying to get the sister to hand over their child, so I'd have the same worry if I were in his shoes. No contact until the sister gets mental help would be fair.", "So why is op the guilty one?? For standing up for his wife and not let his sister attack her?? Now it's an ah move to tell someone who bullies your wife to get the fuck out?? \n\n>she needed to get help, that she needed to check herself in\n\nThe only one here who needs help is op's sister.", "I'd say trying to convince someone they need to be commited is trying to get them commited. They're just trying to keep their hands clean while doing so.", "Ffs, nowadays one can't say something to a bully because it's insensitive?? \n\nNever mind that it's true, she can't know how ppd feels since she never gave birth. Which, honestly,i can't see how it can be considered an insult. I mean, i don't know how cancer feels because i never had it, and if someone would point it out to me i wouldn't feel insulted.", "I think that guy is wrong too, but he didn't overhear that part\n\nHe asked what was going on and that's when his wife told him, \n\n>\"Your fucking sister seems to think that I need to hand the baby over to her and go check myself in to the hospital because apparently she knows what PPD feels like even though she's never fucking carried a child or given birth\"", "Yep, because no post partem mom has ever had mood swings. It's not like she has a crazy amount of hormones running through her system and that could never ever effect changing moods.  \n\nPeople need to calm down, my wife could easily go from passed off to happy crying within a couple moments while pregnant and for a few months after. It's normal and predictable behavior when your hormones are like that, not to mention the stress and lack of sleep that comes with a new baby.\n\nSister needs ro let mom just mom.", "Oh you're not wrong. \n\nI didn't mean it was a good thing, just that it's a thing that is, because the way I read your post, you seemed incredulous that anyone would act like that. I may have misread you.", "OP didn't say he was worried she might try to kidnap the baby. He's not using that to justify his behavior.\n\nHe told his sister that, in anger, and then specifically labeled that \"word vomit.\" It does not appear that he's *actually* worried about that possibility.\n\n\"No contact until you get some help\" is still fairer than \"get out forever.\"", "No, and I said as much, that he was justified in telling her to leave.\n\nIt's interesting that you introduced the word \"guilty\" there, though.\n\nWhat I said is that he went overboard by making it permanent.", "Yes, he may have said it in anger, but given she was trying to get his wife to give away their baby and commit herself to a mental hospital, he SHOULD worry about her trying to actually steal the baby.", ">OP didn't say he was worried she might try to kidnap the baby. He's not using that to justify his behavior.\n\nUm, yes, he does say that, actually. It's right there in the post: \"in the heat of the moment, said she was no longer allowed near our son bc I don't trust her not to kidnap him.\" Just bc he said it in the heat of the moment, that doesn't mean he didn't mean it or said it only out of anger. Calling it word vomit doesn't mean he wasn't being honest. I've used the phrase word vomit to describe things I rambled out, or when I said more than I meant to, or in a non-cohesive way, but I still meant what I said."]}
