While most of my coworkers are supportive, there's this one guy (30sM) who's been giving me a hard time. His homophobic comments and nasty looks have turned my workplace into a less-than-welcoming environment.\n\nYesterday, my boyfriend Alex came by the office to have lunch with me. It was supposed to be a pleasant break, but things took an uncomfortable turn. Throughout the meal, my colleague glared at us from across the room. I tried to brush it off, hoping Alex wouldn't notice, but as he was leaving, my colleague made a hurtful homophobic remark that left me stunned. I could see the tension in Alex's shoulders, and I felt terrible that he had to experience that.\n\nI had reached my breaking point. I confronted my colleague, telling him that his behavior was hurtful and out of line. I may have gotten a bit heated, but I couldn't let him make our relationship a target.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, I told him that he must be a sad and lonely piece of shit to act this way. I warned him that if I heard any more comments about us, I'd take the matter to HR and ensure he faced consequences.\n\nBy the end of the day, word had spread that my colleague was painting me as the aggressor, claiming I attacked him and made him feel unsafe. In reality, I was just trying to stand my ground and protect my relationship.\n\nHR will be stepping in, and while some coworkers are on my side, the outcome remains uncertain. Alex believes I should have let the comments slide, but I disagree. I'm tired of tolerating bigotry and want him to know he shouldn't accept it either.\n\nHowever, now I'm grappling with the fear of potential job repercussions, and tension in the office is palpable.\n\nSo, I turn to you, Reddit.

Good luck!", "NTA- Hopefully your HR department has the sense to see through his ridiculousness. Tell them about all his homophonic comments and the way he behaved while your partner was in the building.", "NTA. Show that crybully no mercy. Homophobes need to learn that bigotry is not acceptable in the workplace. Although I agree with the other commenters that you should have quietly brought this up with HR instead of letting him get there first.", "NTA.\n\nI'm about to quit my job because of harassment at work. I didn't even ever blow up at the guy. He has a documented history of yelling, violent outbursts, and other harassment including sexual harassment. HR decided that after 17 years of \u201csecond\u201d chances they would give him one final one. Yeah right. \n\nI bring this up because even when you are 100% the victim they may turn a blind eye. The fact that he went to HR first and that he seems to know what language to use in order to sound like a sympathetic victim isn't going to help you. Hopefully, he causes enough problems that they don't mind losing him. They will hold their business interests above anything else. \n\nDisclaimer: I am in the US though and our labor laws are pretty abysmal. My story may not be relevant if you are not in the US. \n\nI'm sorry you are dealing with this.", "You should have reported him to hr after the first comment", "NTA. However, in the future don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself. First off report it right away. Second, leave cuss words out of it.

Stay away from that AH and protect yourself as best you can now. And give your man a hug and I hope you can find some peace together.", "NTA You absolutely did the right thing. You should be able to have lunch with your partner or just exist at work without getting harassed. Having said that, this situation does put you in a precarious position because you gave him a warning that allowed him to get ahead of the event. But that doesn't mean you were in the wrong for standing up for yourself and your partner.", "NTA and neither is Alex.

I really, really hope your HR handles this well and colleague gets reined in.", "NTA. \n\n> Did I do the right thing by standing up for myself and my relationship?\n\nProbably not, at least to me. HR was the way to go if you care about keeping the job. You had an emotional response, it was your breaking point. You seem to have lost control of yourself and of your situation. \n\nThese things happen. There will likely be consequences from the company, and hopefully things work out for you. But you lost control of the situation and gave up power. Now HR and your coworkers can decide your fate.", "You are mixing up two things:\n1. NTA \n2. Was it smart strategically? Tell HR exactly what happened and hope they are reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nyou did the right thing and this is a hill worth dying on. If HR takes repercussions against you, then this is not the workplace for you.", "Sad it came to that. Based on your side of the story, I would say nTA.  Next time just to HR.", "NTA But the approach you took wasn't the greatest, unfortunately with workplace issues (even within bigoted ones) have to have some filters on them, just because HR is still looking out for the company more than you. Despite that I don't think it's something you should let slide, your coworker can keep his views to himself seeing that they don't pertain to him or his work", "NTA for confronting him \n\nBut you definitely screwed yourself over. If you had been reporting this to HR as it was happening, they would have the paper trail documenting his pattern of harassment and would have a strong case against him for creating a hostile work environment. Instead, HR found out about the conflict through your coworker. From their perspective, you suddenly had all these issues with your coworker only *after* you got in trouble. That doesn\u2019t look great. Now it\u2019s your word against his, and you\u2019re starting on the defensive. \n\nAgain, I totally get where you\u2019re coming from. And you\u2019re not the asshole for confronting him. But you just made your life a whole lot harder than it needed to be.", "NTA but they way you handled it wasn't the best. Calling out his behaviour is one thing, the insult starts to muddy things up when HR steps in.", "NTA.  Definitely not.\n\nIf something like this happens again please try to keep your emotions out of it.\n\nWhere I live, workplace policies against harassment usually state that the complainant (you) would need to tell or ask the offender (your co-worker) to stop doing whatever it is they're doing.  Then, you report the matter to HR.  Then, the next time it happens you go directly to HR as you've already told/asked the offender once to stop and they haven't stopped.\n\nSorry that people can be so horrible.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t know that AH is the right term on this. My immediate thought was, \u2018go to HR.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what he said, but simply put, you should have said nothing & gone straight to HR when the incident happened.\n\nI may be missing something, but how does your reaction protect your relationship? I\u2019m trying to put myself in your place, but under the circumstances, it would have been perfectly understandable to me if my s/o said nothing & told me they were going to HR. \n\nYou would have been standing up for yourself by documenting what was said & going directly to HR. He was being a jerk & he knew it & unfortunately, you played in to that when you lost your cool. I hope your coworkers who actually witnessed the incident will stand up for you. Going to HR would not have been letting it slide. If you were outside of the office, I\u2019d completely agree with confronting him, but in this type of situation, don\u2019t give him anything else to say.\n\nI believe you made a mistake in how you handled it under the circumstances (by not going to HR immediately) but you\u2019re not an asshole. That\u2019s on Alex.", "You are very foolish but it\u2019s not too late to get a lawyer", "NTA\n\nThere is only so much a person can take, and you took your co-worker's hurtful, disrespectful bullshit for longer than many others would have.\n\nI hope this turns out well for you.", "ESH-I know that hindsight is 20/20, but you really should have gone to HR when your coworker's behavior started making you uncomfortable and before you lost your cool.\n\nThe heated, emotional response was inappropriate in the workplace, and now you've given the asshat ammunition to use against you when you speak to HR.  These types of people are looking to rile the victims of their prejudices into retaliatory behavior to bring them down to their level.  You handed him that on a silver platter. \n\nUnfortunately, HR tends to lend more credibility to the first complaint, and you gave him a reason to make it..  \"He pushed me to do it\" is a grade-school defense, and it usually doesn't fly with HR unless you have a lot of witnesses of multiple incidents willing to back you.\n\nMy suggestion would be to go into your meeting, stay calm and collected, lay out the situation leading up to the confrontation, apologize for being unprofessional, and ask both what you can to do ease the tension in the office and what they are willing to do to protect you.", "NTA but as others have said, you handled it wrong.\n\nWhen dealing with HR bear in mind their function is not to protect employees but to protect the company from potential legal action by employees. Gather whatever evidence and witness statements you can to support your position. *Do not* admit wrongdoing in your response but do say it's been an ongoing issue and you could no longer remain silent. If they ask if you believe you could have handled it differently, answer honestly but don't offer any more information on that than you're asked for.\n\nYou might also pop into the personnel office for a quick look at your file. It's good to know in advance what information HR is using to assess you as an employee.\n\nGet your ducks in a row. Good luck.", "Need more info-\nWhat did he say?", "NTA even if you kicked him in his tiny ball sack", "INFO: Are you actually allowed to have people who don't work there come to eat lunch with you in the office? Everywhere I've worked has rules against this.", "NTA, but a bit stupid. If it bothered you so much, you should have went to HR first instead of going off on him. \n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for people from oppressed groups to learn to shut up when necessary, no? As a woman, or as a black person, you learn to not let show your anger. I assumed it would be the same for lgbt people.", "ETA this coworker is definitely an asshole but your response was wrong.
