It was supposed to be a pleasant break, but things took an uncomfortable turn. Throughout the meal, my colleague glared at us from across the room.

I could see the tension in Alex's shoulders, and I felt terrible that he had to experience that.\n\nI had reached my breaking point. I confronted my colleague, telling him that his behavior was hurtful and out of line. I may have gotten a bit heated, but I couldn't let him make our relationship a target.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, I told him that he must be a sad and lonely piece of shit to act this way. I warned him that if I heard any more comments about us, I'd take the matter to HR and ensure he faced consequences.\n\nBy the end of the day, word had spread that my colleague was painting me as the aggressor, claiming I attacked him and made him feel unsafe. In reality, I was just trying to stand my ground and protect my relationship.\n\nHR will be stepping in, and while some coworkers are on my side, the outcome remains uncertain. Alex believes I should have let the comments slide, but I disagree. I'm tired of tolerating bigotry and want him to know he shouldn't accept it either.\n\nHowever, now I'm grappling with the fear of potential job repercussions, and tension in the office is palpable.\n\nSo, I turn to you, Reddit.

If you had been reporting this to HR as it was happening, they would have the paper trail documenting his pattern of harassment and would have a strong case against him for creating a hostile work environment.

That doesn\u2019t look great. Now it\u2019s your word against his, and you\u2019re starting on the defensive. \n\nAgain, I totally get where you\u2019re coming from.

Calling out his behaviour is one thing, the insult starts to muddy things up when HR steps in.", "NTA.  Definitely not.\n\nIf something like this happens again please try to keep your emotions out of it.\n\nWhere I live, workplace policies against harassment usually state that the complainant (you) would need to tell or ask the offender (your co-worker) to stop doing whatever it is they're doing.

I\u2019m trying to put myself in your place, but under the circumstances, it would have been perfectly understandable to me if my s/o said nothing & told me they were going to HR. \n\nYou would have been standing up for yourself by documenting what was said & going directly to HR.

Going to HR would not have been letting it slide.

That\u2019s on Alex.", "You are very foolish but it\u2019s not too late to get a lawyer", "NTA\n\nThere is only so much a person can take, and you took your co-worker's hurtful, disrespectful bullshit for longer than many others would have.\n\nI hope this turns out well for you.", "ESH-I know that hindsight is 20/20, but you really should have gone to HR when your coworker's behavior started making you uncomfortable and before you lost your cool.\n\nThe heated, emotional response was inappropriate in the workplace, and now you've given the asshat ammunition to use against you when you speak to HR.  These types of people are looking to rile the victims of their prejudices into retaliatory behavior to bring them down to their level.  You handed him that on a silver platter. \n\nUnfortunately, HR tends to lend more credibility to the first complaint, and you gave him a reason to make it..  \"He pushed me to do it\" is a grade-school defense, and it usually doesn't fly with HR unless you have a lot of witnesses of multiple incidents willing to back you.\n\nMy suggestion would be to go into your meeting, stay calm and collected, lay out the situation leading up to the confrontation, apologize for being unprofessional, and ask both what you can to do ease the tension in the office and what they are willing to do to protect you.", "NTA but as others have said, you handled it wrong.\n\nWhen dealing with HR bear in mind their function is not to protect employees but to protect the company from potential legal action by employees. Gather whatever evidence and witness statements you can to support your position. *Do not* admit wrongdoing in your response but do say it's been an ongoing issue and you could no longer remain silent. If they ask if you believe you could have handled it differently, answer honestly but don't offer any more information on that than you're asked for.\n\nYou might also pop into the personnel office for a quick look at your file.

If it bothered you so much, you should have went to HR first instead of going off on him. \n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for people from oppressed groups to learn to shut up when necessary, no?

I do NOT think that OP is an AH for standing up for himself.  He has created the tension in the office by his response to the situation.  He stated that NOW there is tension in the office, which implies it did not exist prior.  Had he handled it in a manner appropriate to the workplace, it would not have gone down that way.  If OP had allowed HR to perform their duties and that created tension, it wouldn't be on him.\n\nIf OP were dealing with this in a social situation, my response would be much different."]}
