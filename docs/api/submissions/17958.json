Think cotton candy but a little lighter than that.\n\nAlso I'm gonna stop by the local police station on my way home from work and ask them if there's anything they can do to get her to just stop and mind her business lol.

The HOA docs we signed affirm that garages primary use should be for vehicle storage, driveways overflow from that, and cars are allowed to park on the street (with certain restrictions) for less than 24h.  \n\nI say that\u2019s very reasonable.
