I live in a newer subdivision with small lots, and everybody seems to have 4+ vehicles per household.  \n\nPeople like to use their garages for storage, and/or don\u2019t want to do any kind of car shuffling, so people end up parking on the sidewalk grass (killing the grass, weeds take over, making it look bad).  Or they park fully on the streets which are too narrow.  This causes annoying traffic disruption and makes it impossible for school buses and emergency vehicles to get through.  The HOA docs we signed affirm that garages primary use should be for vehicle storage, driveways overflow from that, and cars are allowed to park on the street (with certain restrictions) for less than 24h.  \n\nI say that\u2019s very reasonable.  If the HOA and city didn\u2019t do any parking enforcement, it would be even more of a zoo of people just parking on the street full time and making it so congested, because they don\u2019t care and it\u2019s avoiding a minor inconvenience for *them*.  I don\u2019t like HOAs in general, but the core reason they exist is for stuff like this.  If you have a house somewhere more remote with big lots, HOAs are less useful, but in a more concentrated subdivision where everyone has to live closely with the decisions and behaviors of others, it begins to make some sense.", "Of course.
