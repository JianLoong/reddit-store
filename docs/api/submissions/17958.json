Because it\u2019s a color she doesn\u2019t like? That\u2019s so ridiculous. Personally, I\u2019d start by calling the non-emergency police line and tell them you have someone that is constantly documenting when you are home by taking pictures of your car and posting them online. You don\u2019t know what their intent is, and you\u2019re scared for yourself, property, and roommates. It\u2019ll have the cops talking to her once and maybe she\u2019ll stop. Also, NTA", "Have you consider reporting *her* for harassment? She has made posts about you, she has approached you over total nonsense, she\u2019s even tried taking it to the HOA. If anyone is a victim hear it\u2019s you. NTA\n\nETA: it probably is super annoying for the other neighbours though\u2026 I\u2019d stop setting off the alarm but start documenting it/ taking pics of her when she is doing it so you have a record of her behaviour. She sounds unhinged and who knows who she sends those pics to", "NTA \n\nBut STOP. Because now you\u2019re giving her grounds to report you. Look, you have a phone, right? Just turn the tables and video her when she approaches to take a picture. \n\nTake pictures and document, so now you have grounds to report her. But stop with the noise - you\u2019re definitely annoying your other neighbours too.", "NTA But what *you* should do is report *her* for harassment.  \n\nBest thing is that you have proof and you can ger more proof.  You have the HOA complaint, you have the posts on the neighborhood app, next step is to get a security cam to record her taking pics of of your car.\n\nTake all that to police and report her for harassment", "I think you\u2019re being a little childish if you continue to honk the horn.  You did it a few times, scared her, and let her know you were watching.\n\nNow, why don\u2019t you write a quick note (maybe the length of this post) to your local police department advising them that you are being harassed by this neighbor. Be sure to list what she\u2019s told you during your confrontations, and the ways that she\u2019s trying to get rid of you and your car.  That way, when something happens, she will be the prime suspect. You could send her a copy of the letter after the cops have it. That should shut her up.", "NTA.\n\n>told me that my car was an eyesore and messed with the curb appeal of the neighborhood.\n\nI don't know where to begin with complete and utter nonsense of this magnitude.", "ESH it\u2019s probably very annoying for everyone to have to hear this, I think you are definitely not harassing her though, she needs to lay off. You should quit that petty business and if she does anything other than take a picture of your car, she\u2019s in the wrong (and could be held accountable, get a camera in your car.) As it is you\u2019re giving her fodder, don\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nHonk with pride!", "NTA\n\nSwap your names on the letter she left you and put it back in her letterbox. She\u2019s the one acting childish and disruptive.", "NTA- make a police report for her stalking behaviour\u2026", "It just seems to be a total waste of time in my opinion. Like I get she is being a dick, but it sounds like it's resulting in you often neighbour watching to see what she is doing. \n\nAlso it could be giving her ammunition to make an actual complaint. \n\nWhat does she think she is going to do with pictures of a parked car? But when that car is continually making loud noises... She's got more to make a point \n\nI would leave it be and let her waste her time taking pictures, and simply get on with my life. \n\nNTA, but it's just a waste of time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
