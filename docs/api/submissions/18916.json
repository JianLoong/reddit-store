{"id": 18916, "submission_id": "13zs0kq", "title": "AITA for \"stealing\" my friends dream girl", "selftext": "So I (20M) have a friend Marcus (19M), we've known each other since we were kids and have been through a lot together. Now me and him although very similar are very different when it comes to love and relationships. I'm a hopeless romantic always giving gifts and being affectionate and stuff, while he's more of a don't show or tell type person, if he likes someone he'll just flat out tell them, no wooing or anything. He's been in relationships for months and I would have never guessed since he acts like he isn't even with them. Not saying he didn't care about his girlfriends just that he did it differently.\n\nWe both go to the same college and during one class we both meet this amazing girl named Diana. We all became friends and soon start hanging out together during all our free time. Now immediately I figured Marcus had a crush on her, he was always texting her, walking her to classes, etc. I didn't like her in that way at all, I had actually been talking to another girl at the time, but that didn't stop me from wanting Diana to know I cared about her. \nSo I would do what I did for other friends, take her out to do things she liked, bring her dinner and coffee when she worked late, just stuff like that. I know it sounds like flirting, but I do this with everyone including my guy friends, I like to spoil everyone. Marcus would come along too since again I wasn't trying to get with Diana.\n\nEventually Marcus confessed to me that he really did like Diana and would appreciate if I backed off with all my affection, and flirting. I tried to reassure him I wasn't into her, but said I'd back off anyway. I'd never seen him talk about a girl like this before and he really seemed in love. He referred to her as his 'dream girl' since she was everything he wanted in a girlfriend. He planned on asking her out on Friday, and I wished him luck. \n\nNow here's where I may have fully screwed up and may be the AH, Diana was working super late (1am) and was starving so I offered to bring her dinner like I had time and time before. We get to talking and I end up staying at her work until her shift is over. During this time she told me she knew I could always count on me and that I was an amazing guy etc. I just took this as her being appreciative (I know, okay sometimes I can be really dense). Come Friday Marcus calls me angrily screaming that I had gone against his wishes and had flirted with her again and now she was into me. Turns out when Diana met him before he could ask her out she started asking about me and if he thought I was into her. \n\nNow Marcus won't talk to me at all since he thinks I did all of this on purpose to steal Diana from him. Maybe I should've been less affectionate.

Diana isn't an object. You were being kind, and Marcus flying off the rails because Diana expressed interest in you is absurd. Sounds like he was more interested in talking about her than talking TO her. Why wasn't he bringing her coffee and dinner? But Y W B T A if, after finding out it comes across as flirting to Diana, you continue leading her on.", "INFO: Does Marcus recognize that women are people with their own preferences, not objects to be selected by others?\n\nNTA, she\u2019s her own person and can make her own choices. If he wants to ask her out, he\u2019s free to do so.", "As expressed by another Redditor this may be an unpopular opinion, but NTA. You were being kind, and Diana just fell for you, that\u2019s not your fault. Honestly if Diana is truly this dream girl that Marcus describes, and he is truly in love with her, part of me wonders why he\u2019s not the one doing all these things for her?", "NTA Why should he be able to dictate who you\u2019re doing nice things for?! You\u2019re just being you and she thinks that is attractive!

When you're not in a relationship, mention THAT from time to time, making it clear you aren't currently interested. Be up front and above board so you're not misleading anyone. \n\nYou didn't make Diana fall for you on purpose, but you weren't clear enough that you were just being friendly.", "NTA - It is not your fault that your kindness is misinterpreted. Marcus needs to get over it, and should have asked the girl out. He is blaming you for his lack of initiative. I hate how some people think that just because you are kind to people, you are leading them on.", "NTA. You made an effort, and were a kind friend. Women like that! Marcus spunds like he thinks he's entitled to Diana simply by virtue of finding her attractive, no effort required, whoch... ew. Gross. You sound like a good kid.", "NTA. You never expressed interest and it\u2019s fair for her to have caught feelings because you seem very kind\u2026but that\u2019s not on you \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Sounds like Marcus needs to step it up and you need to be transparent with her.", "NTA. You can't \"steal\" a human being (I mean, unless you kidnap them...). Diana is her own person, and can decide for herself who she is, and is not interested in. You will become an a h if you lead her in, now that you know she's interested, however.", "NTA. You are a kind person. And women are not possessions, so you cannot steal one, so that automatically makes him TA.", "NTA. \n\nDiana isn\u2019t an object. She is a person. She also happens to be your friend. You are absolutely allowed to bring friends dinner and hang out with them. \n\nThis also isn\u2019t the 1800s. Marcus can\u2019t call \u2018dibs\u2019 on her, and expect you to cut off the friendship entirely. You don\u2019t have to \u2018respect his wishes\u2019 and do exactly what he says because he indicated a crush. That\u2019s not how the world works, and Marcus is in for a lot of surprises if he thinks he\u2019s entitled to a woman\u2019s time like that. \n\nI think you owe Diana a conversation, just to make sure her wires aren\u2019t crossed and she knows that you\u2019re interested in her as a friend, and a friend only. If you\u2019re feeling brave, maybe talk to Marcus about his behaviour. Or don\u2019t - eventually, a woman is going to tell him, and it won\u2019t be nearly as kind. \n\nAlso, for what it\u2019s worth - when women say that *actual* nice guys finish first, this is what we mean.

And it\u2019s not her fault for liking you.", "NTA", "Uh, I can definitely see why Diana thought you liked her. I don't understand why you didn't see it. You say you do this for all your friends, but it doesn't sound like you told her much or even anything about the person you are interested in. If a guy did for me all those things you did for her, I'd think he liked me. You may not have meant to lead her on, but you should have been clearer from the beginning that you only see her as a friend.", "I plan on talking to her about it, I don't wanna lead her on, and I'm really not into her romantically. And I think she asked him once and he declined cause it was really late and she just never asked him again.", "That's the essential point: DIANA gets to decide who she likes and wants to date, not Marcus.  \n\n\nNTA but if you aren't interested romantically, im\\_nobody\\_18, you need to let her know that.  \n\n\nRight now, NTA.", "Yeah I swear Marcus isn't like a bad guy, I think he's just hurt that the girl he thinks could be the one for him ended up liking me and thinks I wanted her to.", "I don't know honestly. I suggested him doing it before he asked her out, but he said it was \"doing too much\" and that he would just flat out ask her out instead.", "Fair enough, I'll be sure to do that in the future. I'm currently not seeing anyone at the moment, so I'll be sure to make it clear these are just friendly. I don't wanna stop doing nice things for my friends so this is good advice. Thank you wise trumpet man", "THAT\\^\\^\\^\\^  \nMarcus needs to up his game.", "Yeah trust me I will be next time. I've told him before that he needs to try a little more with girls he likes, but he never takes it seriously. I'm gonna talk to her and hopefully him if he answers and try to clear this up.", "Trust me I plan on talking to her ASAP, I don't wanna lead her on at all. I really am just super dense sometimes and I didn't mean to even let her think I was interested in her romantically, I really was just trying to be a good friend.", "Thank you I try my best and yes as soon as I'm able to I'm planning on talking to her about it all she's a great girl who deserves an explanation. As for Marcus I've tried talking to him about it before and he says he just doesn't think it's necessary, but I'll try again if he ever chooses to speak to me again.", "Marcus doesn\u2019t own this girl", "Yeah I understand that, I'm just used to always doing stuff like that for friends. And again it didn't click in my head as flirting when she asked me to bring her dinner. I thought I was just being a good friend.", "I'm not dating anyone, I was just talking to a girl when we first met Diana. It didn't go anywhere so nothing to mention. And again I do, do this for all my friends so to me it's just a nice gesture I do for everyone I care about, plus I can be very very dense sometimes.", "If you are not \"into her romantically\", at this point you owe it to her to tell her directly.", "Marcus sounds entitled and immature.", "I mean you know him better than me so feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong about this, but to me if you can\u2019t even bother to actually try to get to know her and do nice things for her first, then you\u2019re not a very good friend, let alone potential boyfriend.", "It sounds like Diana likes a little bit more than what he is willing to offer. She might be his dream girl, but he is obviously not her dream guy.", "It sounds like anything that actually shows he cares is too much for him. Actions speak louder than words most times and his are pretty silent. Dating someone is more than just being in the same room or sleeping together.", "Marcus sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to put the effort in, but also like he thinks it\u2019s okayDiana  to call \u2018dibs\u2019 on a person. As if that\u2019s actually a thing. \n\nDiana gets a choice in the people she decides to date. You\u2019d do well to remind Marcus of that before he\u2019s in full NiceGuy\u2122\ufe0f territory, because he\u2019s well on his way.", "And you are a good friend. Signals just get crossed sometimes.", "Of course not but he asked his friend to back off the extra friendly behavior so he could ask her out.     OP claims he is not romantically interested in this girl and agreed to back off and didn\u2019t.", "Is Diana friends with any of your other friends? If she hasn\u2019t seen how that\u2019s the you interact with everyone you\u2019re close with then I\u2019m not surprised she got the wrong impression", "I know.    But now you know differently.", "Yeah she's kinda entered our little friend group, we've gone out to eat all together and I paid for the whole thing. And if I'm buying and delivering her coffee I'm usually also going to deliver to a few other friends. The only thing I've really done 'just for her' is deliver her food at her work when she's working late and can't go get it herself. I mean I've done it for other friends, just not as frequent as I've done for her.", "In that case, NTA.\n\nFrom the comments, Marcus doesn\u2019t have any interest in doing nice things he considers flirting if directed a woman but wants you to stop so he doesn\u2019t look bad. He\u2019s (maybe?) also been asked on a date by Diana but turned down the invitation cause it wasn\u2019t convenient for him but when most women get turned down they don\u2019t keep pushing.", "Boy, you are either dense as heck or secretly deceitful if you didn\u2019t see this coming.", "Unpopular YTA . \n\nYou knew what you were doing .", "You\u2019re NTA about Marcus, Diana is entitled to date whoever she wants to, and honestly, he doesn\u2019t sounds like a catch. \nHowever, you\u2019re slightly TAH regarding Diana, I think if someone would do these kind of things for me I would think they were into me. You sound like an amazing friend, but just make sure that you don\u2019t lead people on. Maybe it\u2019s better to tell her casually that she\u2019s a good friend or that you\u2019re not looking for a relationship right now.", "NTA.\n\nA 20-year younger me would have thought otherwise, but that guy's an immature idiot whose buddy did something very similar and actually did something very similar himself to another buddy. \n\nThe reason I bring this up is so that you never feel that you f*cked your relationship up with your friend. Things like these happen. You'll be fine. You'll both be fine.\n\nAnd let the lady decide for herself, mmkay? You can't call \"dibs\" on a person.", "Ehhhh ESH, but these things happen. \n\nMarcus doesn\u2019t own Diana and she can feel however she wants because she\u2019s her own person, and yes he should\u2019ve tried harder, but he did also have you promise him to step back with the gestures and then you failed to actually honor that. None of this is anyone\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d per se but I think you really need to do something to make it up to both of them, since Diana was also kind of lead on. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this involves one or both of them pulling away from the friend group tbh.", "NTA she isn\u2019t an object to be stolen", "NTA. Marcus doesn\u2019t get to police your behaviour towards your friend just because he fancies her and he doesn\u2019t get to decide how Diane responds - telling you to back off because he thinks she\u2019s his makes her an object with no freedom of choice.", "Yeah I understand that, I really did think that everything I did was just friendly, especially since I did it to everyone. I always would mention how she's a great friend that I'm glad is in my life, but maybe that wasn't good enough? I'm gonna work on it so this doesn't happen again.", "If he thinks she could be \"the one\" he needs to consider making an effort to treat her well.", "Yes, but if you're straight and doing these things for guy friends, then they most likely wouldn't misinterpret it. But it's different when it's a straight woman who likes you. Your friend Marcus is wrong to blame you; he should blame himself. I know you didn't know she liked you. But going forward, you should make sure this doesn't happen again so that other women don't get their hopes up. Not everyone will misinterpret what you do for them like she did. But some of them might. So you may need to dial it back a little or at least make it clear that you only see them as friends.", "NTA\n\nDiana (and women) are not slot machines that cash out after you insert a certain number of nice coins. \nAnd Marcus CERTAINLY does not get to decides who interacts with her because he wants first pick!!\n\nYou treated her like an equal, not a prize and surprise, women like that. (But do tell her asap if you\u2019re not seeing yourself going down that road eith her)", "NTA. I'd say that you and Marcus were showing nearly an equal amount of care for Diana, except Marcus had a crush on her and you didn't. Diana has free will to choose, and she seems to have chosen you. If you're not interested, let her know in a kind way.", "NTA. Marcus has some fucked up views on relationships. Sorry but if you just generally being a kind person is something he can't have around a girl he likes that is pathetic. \n\nLike let's think about it. If the only way he can get her interest is trying to shoo off people who are more attractive to her just through existing what the fuck kind of relationship is that lmao. He's aiming to be one of those petty controlling jealous types and needs to get over himself", "NTA you cannot steal a person they are their own human being. It seems like Diana was never into him anyways. I do believe that you need to talk to her so she knows that you were just being friendly and do not have a romantic interest. That way she isn\u2019t lead on.", "NTA. How do you get along with Marcus?  I hate to say this, but I will say it. You sound me like me at your age (I assume I'm your parents' age), and Marcus sounds like a friend I grew up with. \n\nWe went to different colleges, but he pretty much lived at my college. After that, we just drifted more and more.  I am not even friends with him on social media or anything.  I saw him at my mother's funeral in 2016.  He did show up.  Then I ran into him coming out of a bar with a woman who wasn't his wife in 2019 (it could've been a friend, a coworker idk, i do have assumptions though)   I just sort of gave him a head nod.  That is the last I have seen of him. \n\nSo what I am saying. I feel you are going to drift away from Marcus.", "YTA. You need to understand that going as far above and beyond as you are usually conveys romantic interest. Why? Because this is going to keep happening, and it\u2019s going to cause problems with your friendships, male and female. You need to make it clear that you are only interested in friendship, for your future sanity.", "NTA if this is how you are with everyone.  However, he did ask you to back off..  you shouldn't have offered food. That was on you.", "NTA\n\nMarcus' fantasy about Diana as his \"dream girl\" doesn't mean that's reality.\n\nShe's also a human being who gets to decide who SHE wants to date and is attracted to.\n\nHonestly, if you want to avoid the drama, talk to her directly and let her know how he feels, but also respect her decisions", "OP is one dense mfer", "It is not nessesary, but like in all things, if Marcus always only do the absolute bare minimum he will always be beaten by his competition as long as they just do a little more than the absolute minimum. And for some people the bare minimum is not enough for a good working relashionship. What you put in you get out, so Marcus is always going to get the bare minimum back from his partners and they will leave him when they get tired of bare minimum."]}
