We met because of mutual love of a book series and then formed our own group of 8 people, discussing and sharing things in a group chat. We\u2019ve known each other for almost a year and all of us have all met every person of the 8 of the group, but not all 8 at the same time because everyone\u2019s work schedule just didn\u2019t work out. This Saturday would be the first time we 8 can be together.\n\nI offered to host because my place is the largest. Three asked to bring their SO and I said OK. I asked for dietary restrictions and preferences and finished my shopping a couple days ago. I planned to make a chicken dish from our book, vegetable soup, and cheesy bread. Everyone was happy with the menu and offered to bring dessert, fruits and drinks.\n\nJust last night one friend Gary asked if he could bring his new girlfriend who\u2019s a fellow fan of the book. Everyone said OK. Gary said his girlfriend is vegan and requested I make something extra for her.\n\n I said the only vegan thing I could think of making on the fly was something simple like rice or baked potatoes or roasted vegetables. I don\u2019t live near a grocery store and buying groceries take planning and I already went for the week. Gary asked if I could make a vegan dish from the book so his girlfriend would feel included. I told him that would be hard to do and he and his girlfriend were free to bring in their own food.\n\nGary recently told us his girlfriend won\u2019t be joining and so he will not as well. My other friend Chloe offered to make a small vegan dish from the book and bring it over but Gary just said he would take a rain check. So now it would just be 7 of us without Gary.\n\nNobody in the group said anything but I could not help but feel guilty. I could have told Gary I would look into it without rejecting his request outright and later on DM others asking for help or something. It was such a bummer not having the entire group together.

He could bring a vegan dish, leave the GF home, or not come to the dinner.  He had choices and he made his. Asking the host to change the menu last minute is rude", "NTA. It was unreasonable to think you'd have all of the supplies to create this whole vegan dish for one person (that you don't even know, that is a late edition) when you have already painstakingly prepared a particular meal and they all knew about it. You offered what you could do to try to accommodate her at least partially (baked potato, veggies), your friend Chloe offered to make a dish, you told them that they could bring a dish (or a main dish if they wanted to take you up on the sides offer), but it still wasn't good enough for them. You are not a restaurant and she is a late edition who you don't even know. You definitely don't need to, nor should you be expected to, bend over backwards to make her a meal you've never made before -- she probably would have thrown a tantrum if it wasn't up to her standards, too.", "NTA\n\nI don't really think I have to elaborate that.\n\nThat is what happens, when things appear out of the sudden. You explained your side of the situation, so they had the opportunity to make a compromise. You did everything you could.\n\nIf I may speak out of experience, you can't please everyone. If they wanna complain, then they complain. Just keep in mind, that you didn't do anything wrong and you even tried to find a compromise. That's more than they did", "NTA. The girlfriend wasn\u2019t even INVITED. You don\u2019t get to invite yourself to a party and demand they make special food for you. Holy entitlement!", "NTA it was too short notice.

I mean, it's too much ! People are no more respectful when they are guests ! It's not a restaurant, they don't pay to eat !

All at your expense?\n\nI think the friend group is better off without him.", "I\u2019m a vegan and if I\u2019m going to a dinner party etc I always make my dietary requirements known and ask if I can help by bringing something. I would especially do this if it was a last minute thing.

He then expected you to spend more money and put in more work to accommodate his lack of manners.

I told him that would be hard to do and he and his girlfriend were free to bring in their own food.\n\nGary is beginning to sound like an increasing ass with this attitude. If he's that bothered about her coming, he should be prepared to make something _himself_ instead of making this someone else's problem he's made a last minute request and is making that request more of a _demand_ now.\n\nHis little bit there of \"making her feel included\" is also 100% not up to you or _anyone_ else, it was him that even got her involved to start with - it's far from your problem about her feeling \"included\" in a group that's made plans and last minute she wants in on it. It'd be no more reasonable than asking you to accommodate another 10 people with a day's notice then having a tantrum they \"aren't able to eat as there isn't enough\".\n\n>Gary recently told us his girlfriend won\u2019t be joining and so he will not as well.\n\n>Gary just said he would take a rain check. \n\n>Nobody in the group said anything but I could not help but feel guilty.\n\n>It was such a bummer not having the entire group together\n\nLet's be fair here OP, everything was absolutely fine until Gary wanted to bring an extra, which was last minute _and_ also expected __you__ to accommodate her needs. He didn't offer to make something himself, or bring their own food (though you said this is fine) - he's _making_ it your problem.\n\nIt's not on you, especially given the circumstances of how far you need to go to shop, as well as having given ample opportunity for everyone to talk about food and prepped ahead of time. Again, this was all working fine until Gary wanted to change things.\n\nHe's being a petulant child about the whole thing, as was more than happy to come until she couldn't be last-minute accomodated and now is acting how he is.\n\nThe only way this could possibly have been any different is to have explained that things were set and agreed on and you can't logistically go shopping again at such short notice, so real sorry but the only way she'll get to have a Vegan dish is if they bring something.", "NTA Gary and his girlfriend are joined at the hip. You are all better off without them there", "I'm usually a big \"yes, you need to feed the vegan\" proponent, but having someone come in to a group last minute like this is tough. They could have brought something themselves in this case. NTA", "NTA, I think it really sucks that Gary backed out, but a last-minute vegan request for a specific dish from a book... pretty inconvenient and a bit inconsiderate. \nAccommodating a last-minute +1 is already kind of you, but to ask you to prepare an entirely different dish is a bit rude.\n\nEdit to add, I have a child with celiac disease, and I always offer to bring gluten-free meals for her.", "NTA\n\nGary is so rude to invite his GF at almost the last minute and then insist she has a special dish.\n\nHonestly, this would not be a raincheck for me as Gary and his GF would never be invited again.", "NTA. It was a very last minute notice and you've already offered to cook alternatives but they didn't want it. Either they take up your offer or bring their own dishes.", "NTA. If someone asks to bring a guest at the last minute and the guest has food restrictions, they should bring a dish with them.", "If I was a last minute addition to a book-themed dinner I\u2019d settle for vegetable soup (if no meat stock) and cheesy bread.

I'm pretty much always happy to accommodate people's eating habit but I live a 10min walk from a supermarket - and I kind of expect time to plan. If there's no time to plan and no supermarket nearby, I'd tell them that there will be something they can eat but I won't be able to put on a vegan feast. Pasta with tomato sauce and roasted veg is a proper meal. Rice and veg if seasoned nicely are a proper meal. Telling the host that a non-invited short-notice guest wants a specific meal is not ok.", "NTA\n\nGary wanted to bring the girl. Gary should have brought something she could eat. \n\nHis taste in women and unwillingness to lift a finger for them other than to pressure you, does not make it your culinary emergency.

No one in the group knows her so bringing the dish would\u2019ve been a nice ice breaker into the group and to discuss the book. This was a planned meal that took time and effort.

They can finish it them selves", "I would completely agree with this post as N T A if it was tomorrow or Saturday. There is plenty of time to run to the store to get ingredients for one more dish and time to make it. You could even get a frozen vegan dish, throw it into your own dishware and make it look like you made it.
