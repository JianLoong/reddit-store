We met because of mutual love of a book series and then formed our own group of 8 people, discussing and sharing things in a group chat. We\u2019ve known each other for almost a year and all of us have all met every person of the 8 of the group, but not all 8 at the same time because everyone\u2019s work schedule just didn\u2019t work out. This Saturday would be the first time we 8 can be together.\n\nI offered to host because my place is the largest. Three asked to bring their SO and I said OK. I asked for dietary restrictions and preferences and finished my shopping a couple days ago. I planned to make a chicken dish from our book, vegetable soup, and cheesy bread. Everyone was happy with the menu and offered to bring dessert, fruits and drinks.\n\nJust last night one friend Gary asked if he could bring his new girlfriend who\u2019s a fellow fan of the book. Everyone said OK. Gary said his girlfriend is vegan and requested I make something extra for her.\n\n I said the only vegan thing I could think of making on the fly was something simple like rice or baked potatoes or roasted vegetables. I don\u2019t live near a grocery store and buying groceries take planning and I already went for the week. Gary asked if I could make a vegan dish from the book so his girlfriend would feel included. I told him that would be hard to do and he and his girlfriend were free to bring in their own food.\n\nGary recently told us his girlfriend won\u2019t be joining and so he will not as well. My other friend Chloe offered to make a small vegan dish from the book and bring it over but Gary just said he would take a rain check. So now it would just be 7 of us without Gary.\n\nNobody in the group said anything but I could not help but feel guilty. I could have told Gary I would look into it without rejecting his request outright and later on DM others asking for help or something. It was such a bummer not having the entire group together.

He could bring a vegan dish, leave the GF home, or not come to the dinner.  He had choices and he made his. Asking the host to change the menu last minute is rude", "NTA. It was unreasonable to think you'd have all of the supplies to create this whole vegan dish for one person (that you don't even know, that is a late edition) when you have already painstakingly prepared a particular meal and they all knew about it. You offered what you could do to try to accommodate her at least partially (baked potato, veggies), your friend Chloe offered to make a dish, you told them that they could bring a dish (or a main dish if they wanted to take you up on the sides offer), but it still wasn't good enough for them. You are not a restaurant and she is a late edition who you don't even know. You definitely don't need to, nor should you be expected to, bend over backwards to make her a meal you've never made before -- she probably would have thrown a tantrum if it wasn't up to her standards, too.", "NTA\n\nI don't really think I have to elaborate that.\n\nThat is what happens, when things appear out of the sudden. You explained your side of the situation, so they had the opportunity to make a compromise. You did everything you could.\n\nIf I may speak out of experience, you can't please everyone. If they wanna complain, then they complain. Just keep in mind, that you didn't do anything wrong and you even tried to find a compromise. That's more than they did", "NTA. The girlfriend wasn\u2019t even INVITED. You don\u2019t get to invite yourself to a party and demand they make special food for you. Holy entitlement!", "NTA it was too short notice.

That doesn't fly in my book.\n\nHe should have done something to make that happen himself, show up early and borrow your kitchen. Now that would get him major points with his GF.", "Gary: I\u2019d like to bring my new gf who is vegan.

I mean, it's too much ! People are no more respectful when they are guests ! It's not a restaurant, they don't pay to eat ! You offered to made something and he has the nerve to ask for a specific dish ? I just can't understand that behavior !", "NTA.  It was last minute, and you were unable to accommodate them.  If you had more notice you could have.", "Gary\u2019s being dramatic. You\u2019re fine and did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nHow entitled can Gary be to think his girlfriend deserves a little special dish all for her?

All at your expense?\n\nI think the friend group is better off without him.", "I\u2019m a vegan and if I\u2019m going to a dinner party etc I always make my dietary requirements known and ask if I can help by bringing something. I would especially do this if it was a last minute thing.

The only person who gets to okay guests is the host, the one putting in the work and paying for things.

He then expected you to spend more money and put in more work to accommodate his lack of manners.

I told him that would be hard to do and he and his girlfriend were free to bring in their own food.\n\nGary is beginning to sound like an increasing ass with this attitude. If he's that bothered about her coming, he should be prepared to make something _himself_ instead of making this someone else's problem he's made a last minute request and is making that request more of a _demand_ now.\n\nHis little bit there of \"making her feel included\" is also 100% not up to you or _anyone_ else, it was him that even got her involved to start with - it's far from your problem about her feeling \"included\" in a group that's made plans and last minute she wants in on it. It'd be no more reasonable than asking you to accommodate another 10 people with a day's notice then having a tantrum they \"aren't able to eat as there isn't enough\".\n\n>Gary recently told us his girlfriend won\u2019t be joining and so he will not as well.\n\n>Gary just said he would take a rain check. \n\n>Nobody in the group said anything but I could not help but feel guilty.\n\n>It was such a bummer not having the entire group together\n\nLet's be fair here OP, everything was absolutely fine until Gary wanted to bring an extra, which was last minute _and_ also expected __you__ to accommodate her needs. He didn't offer to make something himself, or bring their own food (though you said this is fine) - he's _making_ it your problem.\n\nIt's not on you, especially given the circumstances of how far you need to go to shop, as well as having given ample opportunity for everyone to talk about food and prepped ahead of time. Again, this was all working fine until Gary wanted to change things.\n\nHe's being a petulant child about the whole thing, as was more than happy to come until she couldn't be last-minute accomodated and now is acting how he is.\n\nThe only way this could possibly have been any different is to have explained that things were set and agreed on and you can't logistically go shopping again at such short notice, so real sorry but the only way she'll get to have a Vegan dish is if they bring something.", "NTA Gary and his girlfriend are joined at the hip. You are all better off without them there", "I'm usually a big \"yes, you need to feed the vegan\" proponent, but having someone come in to a group last minute like this is tough. They could have brought something themselves in this case. NTA", "NTA, I think it really sucks that Gary backed out, but a last-minute vegan request for a specific dish from a book... pretty inconvenient and a bit inconsiderate. \nAccommodating a last-minute +1 is already kind of you, but to ask you to prepare an entirely different dish is a bit rude.\n\nEdit to add, I have a child with celiac disease, and I always offer to bring gluten-free meals for her.", "NTA\n\nGary is so rude to invite his GF at almost the last minute and then insist she has a special dish.\n\nHonestly, this would not be a raincheck for me as Gary and his GF would never be invited again.", "NTA. It was a very last minute notice and you've already offered to cook alternatives but they didn't want it. Either they take up your offer or bring their own dishes.", "NTA. If someone asks to bring a guest at the last minute and the guest has food restrictions, they should bring a dish with them.", "If I was a last minute addition to a book-themed dinner I\u2019d settle for vegetable soup (if no meat stock) and cheesy bread.

If I\u2019m offered to bring my own vegetarian main course, I will take that opportunity to do just that.\n\nThis Gary and/or his new girlfriend do not want to attend, and use the vegetarian situation as an excuse.

I'm pretty much always happy to accommodate people's eating habit but I live a 10min walk from a supermarket - and I kind of expect time to plan. If there's no time to plan and no supermarket nearby, I'd tell them that there will be something they can eat but I won't be able to put on a vegan feast. Pasta with tomato sauce and roasted veg is a proper meal. Rice and veg if seasoned nicely are a proper meal. Telling the host that a non-invited short-notice guest wants a specific meal is not ok.", "NTA\n\nGary wanted to bring the girl. Gary should have brought something she could eat. \n\nHis taste in women and unwillingness to lift a finger for them other than to pressure you, does not make it your culinary emergency.

I'd consider making it permanent.", "Gary is an idiot", "NTA!\n\nIn my eyes, if you wanna bring a last minute guest and they have dietary restrictions, then /you're/ the one who should arrange so there's food for them as well.\n\nEspecially if you already Okay-ed the menu. \n\nNo matter what, NTA. \n\nLike, did be meet the girlfriend /that/ day? Or only think to invite her as some way to make it a \"date\" for them with very low effort on his end? Especially since someone else literally offered the perfect fix but he just cut his losses rather than go \"great!\"\n\n\n... yeah, the only way this makes sense to me is if Gary thought he could show off by inviting his girlfriend and also \"arranging\" the meal for her (via you, OP), but since you couldn't maybe he gave some excuse.

No one in the group knows her so bringing the dish would\u2019ve been a nice ice breaker into the group and to discuss the book. This was a planned meal that took time and effort.

They can finish it them selves", "I would completely agree with this post as N T A if it was tomorrow or Saturday. There is plenty of time to run to the store to get ingredients for one more dish and time to make it. You could even get a frozen vegan dish, throw it into your own dishware and make it look like you made it.

You don't crash someone else's dinner party uninvited then demand a menu change to your preferences.  It's standard to offer to bring food if you have dietary needs,  IMO.\n\nEveryone else is bringing something.  Why couldn't Gary and his lazy missus bring a plate of falafel or bean salad to share and have some of the fruit?", "Especially when OP said a shopping trip takes planning and preparation (either location issue or medical issue doesn't matter) and Gary made his request after that trip happened. In my opinion, if OP told everyone in the chat to have dietary requirements in by 'x' day to allow for shopping then it's NTA but if they didn't then it's NAH and just chalk it up to bad communication.", "It\u2019s actually pretty unreasonable and rude to back out of a dinner party at the last minute when the host has already purchased food assuming you will be there, just because the host isn\u2019t able to make extra, different food for a last minute guest who wasn\u2019t invited, after the grocery shopping and menu planning was already complete.", "Its kind of self centered to add last minute a new plus-one with special accommoodations needed and expect the host to do everything", "I think it was pretty unreasonable for him to ask for a specific vegan dish (he said he wanted a vegan dish from the book they were reading). OP did try to accommodate by giving a few simple options. Definitely NTA and if anything slight TA for gary", ">How hard would it have been to throw a couple of potatoes in the oven?\n\nDid you read the post?

OP couldn't offer more as OP can't go for groceries with so little time left. Gary is rude for inviting someone in last minute. Gary felt entitled anyways for his gf to get a vegan recipe from OP's book, when OP isn't able to get the ingredients with the time OP had left", "OP offered a compromise. Gary declined it and insisted OP make something else out of the book especially for the GF.", "But do your guests throw a surprise food restriction on you last minute, which is what Entitled Gary did? This girl was not part of the original group-- she was an add-on, so it's up to her or Gary to provide something she could eat.", "Not everyone can just jump into their car and drive to a grocery store whenever they feel like it. Food deserts are a very real thing - especially for vegan-friendly foods like fresh produce. \n\nOP doesn't live near a grocery store. She offered to cook something simple for Gary's girlfriend (rice, roasted veggies, baked potato) because that's all the vegan-friendly food she had access to at the time. I'm sure she would have loved to make a full meal that accommodated all her guests (as evidenced by her accommodating the other partners' dietary needs) but that just wasn't possible for her to do on such short notice. Welcome to life in a food desert. \n\nSaying that all this means OP shouldn't ever be a host because she is \"that bad at it\" is so damn arrogant and classist - should she also never host if she can't serve her guests their meals on fine china with golden cutlery???\n\nYour privilege is showing.

Asking to bring her along was already OP accommodating you because it's one thing to prepare a dinner for 8 and a whole different thing to include everyone's SOs amounting to 16 in total.\n\nPlus ,dude you knew the menu from the start. You didn't care to ask early on instead you left things for last minute and then you dare get offended OP doesn't bend over backwards?!!\n\nHello? Houston calling.. OP isn't a restaurant nor your maid.", "Exactly. He already agreed to the menu before hand. She also offered to make a simple dish for her and he still thinks it ain't good enough.", "Especially when it's a food preference.

English is not my first language, and although it seemed like a typo, it also made sense in a very weird way...  like she is the latest edition of a gf for him.. I know, weird.", "It is a book club", "Very sensible comment. Apparently, Gary likes to be accommodated instead of making a reasonable effort. Some people think the world owes them this.", "I wonder if Gary forgot to tell OP that girlfriend was coming at all and is trying to save face with her.", "It doesn't matter if op lives 1 minute of walking away from a grocery shop or needs to plan the trip, if you invite someone with special diatery needs wants to join last minute and expect someone to cook an extra meal for just 1 person you're the AH.\n\nEdit: grammar", "It\u2019s still an esh - you host a party, invite guests and then serve them food they will eat.  If one cannot do that, then don\u2019t be a host.", "Yup - they do - so I ensure I have vegan dishes (not that hard to make fondant potatoes - no dairy, one can use veggie stock, so there\u2019s one dish, glazed carrots is another, broccoli, cauliflower are general staples on my table).  Vegetable soup is by its very nature vegan, unless it is not really vegetable soup\u2026and yes some of the people at my table are that rude they would spring their new and exciting food preferences without notice.  I am reminded of the time my niece told me she was pescatarian - so I suggested she stick to the fish but then I quickly realized that she had no idea what a pescatarian was..\n\nPeople are either good hosts or they are not.  The OP is not a good host.  Good hosts ensure that their guests are welcome.  They ensure that all of their guests have good food to eat.  Or at least that was what my mother and grandmother taught me.  Maybe others were raised differently, but there was always room at the table for one more person where I lived.  It doesn\u2019t matter whether Gary was a good guest - that\u2019s irrelevant.  What is relevant is that the host makes their guests feel welcome, and that didn\u2019t happen.", "I've actually recently seen plant based b'ef and chick'n broths in the soup aisle at my local store. Perfect for such an occasion. However, they are still NTA as they didn't have the time to go back to the store to change up the menu to accommodate this new person. If you're going somewhere that you aren't sure of, especially last minute, you bring your own food with you. I do it all the time with my vegetarian kiddo.", "This made sense, even if it wasn't proper. I read it like editing the guest list.", "Although it is not a common way to say it, \"the latest edition of a gf\" is actually grammatically correct in this context and in my opinion, cleverly funny!", "OP didn't invite the girlfriend though.  \nThey had invited the other guests and planned a menu that catered to the invited guests preferences.   \nGary invited the GF last minute.  \nThey mentioned the dishes that would be safe and offered to make other safe options which were declined because he wanted a special dish just for GF to feel included.   \nNot being able to produce that last minute doesn't make OP a bad host.  \nIt makes Gary and GF bad guests.", "OP didn\u2019t invite vegan girlfriend. Gary asked to include her last minute.

They are a bad host - they shouldn\u2019t do it anymore.", "Yeah when he didn\u2019t have a significant other. And when he got one he was given many options. They aren\u2019t a bad host the couple are just shitty guests."]}
