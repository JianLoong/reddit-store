We are pretty soft about birthdays and gifts around my house, they might show up any time.  If you want them, why not let her get them?  It seems your feelings are hurt because it is a little la de da.  It is a little weird that you have to ask *twice*.

Sometimes people get a little intimidated if they think you won't like it and then they don't know what to do.", "Tbh ESH those knives are probably expensive seeing as you haven\u2019t bought them yourself. I would let her buy them even if you don\u2019t accept them as an apology. You get free axes out of it at the best, the worst you don\u2019t get them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We aren't a very materialistic family, but we try to be mindful of what would make eachother happy. As far as I'm aware there was no tension between us leading up to my birthday besides the actual planning because it seemed like my mom (who is the party planner by choice) didn't want to plan anything for me. For her birthday she actually planned it herself and the kids, me (26) and my sister (30), weren't invited.", "The axes can be kind of expensive, but not to the point where it's out of the question. There was also cheaper stuff on my list. I just haven't bought them myself yet because there was other stuff that I wanted more that I bought instead after my birthday.", "Is this the fist time the kids haven't been invited to her birthday? What was her attitude about that? Has anyone EVER thrown her a party or does she throw her own because no one else will? Did you still get her a present?  Maybe she is the party planner by default rather than by choice. Does anyone help her? Her husband? You kids?   \n\n\nJust saying, if she wasn't mad at you, something seems off here. If it's not any of the above... Is she having any health issues? Depression? Issues in the marriage?", "If yours is the first birthday that came up after her own, maybe she is just tired of being the one doing the planning (especially for her own) for everyone else. If that is the case your siblings might get the same treatment coming up.", "NTA but I would still let her get them, like I said best you get them, worst you don\u2019t. It won\u2019t hurt to say yes and not expect anything. I\u2019m used to my parents constantly pushing off getting me gifts growing up. Now I tell them one thing each to get me. Half the time I get one thing I wanted so not a complete loss", "My birthday is the last birthday of the year. She throws her own parties because she likes planning things. We've tried to throw her parties but she prefer to do it herself. I think for hers she just wanted to hang out with her friends? I still helped her set up though."]}
