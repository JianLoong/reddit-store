I have been friends with my best friend Sarah for coming up on 6 years. Sarah and Ash\u2019s birthdays fall pretty close together, with about 3 weeks in between and Ash\u2019s coming first. I love doing things for peoples birthdays and giving gifts and try to go all out for it. \n\nFor Ash\u2019s birthday, I suprised her with flowers at work and took her to her favorite lunch spot. That evening for dinner I made surf and turf, which I specifically learned how to make for her because she loves it and that weekend we took a road trip to Miami to explore the city and see the sights which is something she wanted to do. I thought that was a lot and she had a good time so I called it a success.\n\nSarahs was last Friday. So, Sarah went through a pretty awful break up. Like volatile screaming and yelling \u201cI never loved you\u201d breakup of a year old relationship. She has been pretty down since. When I told her my plan for Ash\u2019s birthday, she cried because she had no boyfriend to do anything special for her on her birthday. \n\nI really wanted her to have a happy day, so I put a ton of planning into something for her. I organized a surprise birthday party where her sisters and a few friends from of town would fly in to see her and she\u2019d be surrounded by friends and loved ones. This took a ton of work to get everyone attending coordinated, getting decorations, getting her out of the house and distracting her myself while her roommate and other guests set up for the party. When we suprised her it was the happiest I\u2019d seen her in a while. I also got her a physical gift in the form of a bottle of perfume that she told me she wanted but didn\u2019t know where to get as it was always out of stock and a rose gold friendship bracelet.\n\nOnce again, I considered this a birthday success. \n\nMy girlfriend attends the party and saw everything. That next morning, she was pretty upset with me. She said that she was humiliated at the party because everyone saw how much I will do and how far I will go for Sarah. She said that compared to all that I was willing to do for Sarah, her birthday wasn\u2019t special at all. She told me that it came across like I cared about Sarah more than her.\n\nI pushed back on this and told her that while Sarah\u2019s needed more planning, it was because I had to coordinate like 30 people and 6 of which were from out of state traveling. I also mentioned that I spent significantly more money on the trip with her than I did on Sarah\u2019s party.\n\nThis pushed her over the edge and made her cry, which I do feel bad about. She said it doesn\u2019t matter the money, it mattered the effort and the effort I showed for my friend was much more than my girlfriend.\n\nI still don\u2019t really think this is a fair comparison.

Getting another woman gold jewelry and perfume is very personal.\n\nThe other was, well, a date.  A nice date, but nothing much else to differentiate it as a birthday. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday so I\u2019ll turn the boyfriend stuff up a step and level up the date\u201d.  But not birthday stuff.  Not personal stuff - not on the same level as what you did for your friend.", "I'm sorry but YTA.\n\nSarah getting \"sad\" because of how you were planning for Ash birthday is her just being \"jealous\". You won't see it because you're a guy. You humiliated your girlfriend. Not only did you throw this girl a whole surprise party, you got her a damn rose gold bracelet and out of stock perfume?! Lmfao like for what reason did you need to do all of this? You're not the only friend in her life. What you did for Sarah was definitely something a boyfriend would do for his girlfriend. I understood wanting to be there for her but doing the party or a gift would have been ok. Not both.", "So I'm going to say ESH, but I would break up with you.\n\nYour gift to Sarah was so extravagant I don't really know what to say.  Not only did you spend so much time and effort into planning that party, you also bought her several gifts.  I mean, it comes across very much like lovey behavior.  I don't know your relationship with her, but I wouldn't feel comfortable dating a guy who did that for his best girl friend.  \n\nYou're her best friend and you're allowed to have whatever friendship/boundary you want with her.  But if I was your girlfriend that party would have shown me I'm going to be competing with Sarah.  And I wouldn't like that.  I don't think I'd cry over it, but I would just end it and move on.", "He went put of his way to learn to cook a meal GF liked, took her on a date and later a city trip, cute surprises in the form of flowers. All very sweet and appropriate.\n\nThe BFF gets a suprise party, ok I'm still with him, seems fair she had a bad time and OP set up a party with all her loved ones. Way less intimate or romantic a setting then for GF so yes, nice idea.\n\nBut my problem came with the gifts OP then also bought for BFF. A expensive perfume which I'd rate about on the edge of what's appropriate, and a rose gold friendship bracelet. And that.. that is what tipped it over and will make me say YTA. \n\nThat is to intimate. If she wanted the bracelet and all 30 people at that party had pooled together their money and collectivly bought it, I'd judge differently. But giving your friend (of any gender) a rose golden friendship bracelet, I do understand why it would make GF upset and a tad insecure.", ">When I told her my plan for Ash\u2019s birthday, ***she cried because she had no boyfriend to do anything special for her on her birthday***. \n\n\n\nAnd your response was to do more for her than you did for your own girlfriend, something Ash ***AND*** Sarah are now aware of. You went above and beyond, and then bought her expensive gifts that can be considered \"intimate\" because of their personal nature, and you did it in a blatantly public way ***IN FRONT OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND***. \n\nLet me guess. You've also told Ash that she never has to worry about Sarah.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou bought perfume and expensive jewelry for your friend after already having made a *huge* gesture in making her birthday a little reunion?  And not that it'd be much better if you had, but after you *didn't* get jewelry for your girlfriend?  Dude.  Dude.  Come on.  I'm not even particularly into either perfume or jewelry, and this would still piss me off.\n\nI actually think the huge gesture was okay (as you say, some people do just go in on large gestures), and plausibly friendly rather than romantic...until you threw perfume and jewelry into the mix.  This looks romantic, and certainly no less so than the trip you had with your girlfriend.\n\nEspecially considering that you say you did it because of her bad breakup, and you're sad that Sarah's sad that she doesn't have a boyfriend to do special (romantic) things for her.  And even her upset about that was a response to hearing about your romantic plans with your actual girlfriend?  Dude.\n\nYou're not her boyfriend, and *really* shouldn't be playing at it unless you're prepared that people (including your actual girlfriend) are going to take it that way.", "YTA. Date Sarah instead if you're going to continue doing more for her than your own gf", "YTA. I understand why your girlfriend is upset. It\u2019s not all about the money, and it probably wasn\u2019t all about the planning. It was everything. \n\nHaving non-same-sex friends can be touchy. When you and your girlfriend met, Sarah had a boyfriend. Since they\u2019ve broken up, you decided to make her birthday extra special. You went to all the trouble of inviting out-of-town guests. You even went so far as to give Sarah intimate gifts of jewelry and perfume (hard to find perfume at that!). Everything you did for Sarah was for Sarah alone. The big part of your girlfriend\u2019s gift\u2014the trip\u2014was something you experienced and enjoyed too. \n\nFinally, it was your girlfriend who had a milestone birthday. She has to feel like she\u2019s always going to be second to Sarah.", "I know you were just trying to cheer up your friend, but YTA, sorry. Planning the surprise party was fine, but the expensive perfume and the jewelry are things that scream lovey gifts to me. \n\nYou can\u2019t try to fill the boyfriend role for Sarah while dating Ash. If you want to fill the boyfriend role for her, do that and let Ash go. Otherwise, stay in the friend role and don\u2019t go all out with romantic gifts. \n\nIf you and your girlfriend had planned this together or she helped you pick out the bracelet for Sarah, it would be different. \n\n\u201cI thought that was a lot and she had a good time so I called it a success\u201d versus\n\n\u201cI really wanted her to have a happy day\u201d \u201cthis took a ton of work\u201d \u201cit was the happiest I\u2019d seen her in a while\u201d and you got her this super special gift. \n\nThe way you even tell this sounds like you also felt that one was much more meaningful and special than the other experience.", "YTA.   While you might have spent more money on Ash, you put in way more effort into Sarah.", "YTA. It is the thought that counts, and, in this case, you put more thought towards a friend than your girlfriend. Granted you have known one longer than the other, but one is supposed to be your SO. Which, last time I checked, was on a different level than a friend.\n\nSo think about it.  How much thought and work went into Ash's birthday in comparison to Sarah's? Was it a few days, a couple of weeks? Then add in the physical things like the perfume and the bracelet. Did you get Ash anything meaningful like that or was it all just food? Details like this count and you need to consider that.", "YTA\n\nIn addition to what everyone else says in this thread, YOU WERE SARAH\u2019S DATE FOR HER PARTY. Wow. Just wow. You\u2019re really missing a sensitivity chip.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even take Ash out to dinner on her birthday to a nice restaurant, and WHAT DID YOU GET HER FOR A GIFT?", "uh\u2026 what? That\u2019s a bit much YTA", "YTA and I am going to say this, you will find it very difficult to prioritize 2 females in your life, you will have to make a choice between your girlfriend and best friend one day, one of them will have to take a back seat. I have been the girlfriend to the guy with the female best friend, but when she got pregnant (by her husband) she demanded my ex step up to the plate, I was the one who took the back seat. I don\u2019t sit in the back seat, especially if I am moving to start a life together. Hence, the reason he is the EX. And she is right, it isn\u2019t about the money, it is the effort. No woman is going to want to see her man pour in the time and effort to make another woman feel extra special. What happens if the roles were reversed? How would you feel?\n\nEdit to add:\nWhy would you get your best friend a rose gold bracelet but not your girlfriend?\n\nI think I see singleness in your future. A big party, then perfume and a bracelet, that is such a boyfriend move. \n\nSucks Sarah is going through heartbreak, but it isn't your job to heal her.", "YTA. You're acting like you're secretly in love with your \"friend\". Like I already said, you went over the top for your \"friend\".", "YTA. It is in inherently poor taste when you\u2019re in a relationship to do something a boyfriend would do for someone who is not your girlfriend. This gives me some serious ick.", "You put time and effort into Ash's gift, which is great... but you put a lot more time and effort into Sarah's.\n\nI can see why Ash is confused about the role you play in Sarah's life. \n\nEspecially because you did this after Sarah was dumped and then told you how sad she was to not have a BF. It seems like you wanted to step into a \"boyfriend\" role for her. Can't you see why Ash would be confused?\n\nAlso, it must be intimidating for Ash to know you've been Sarah's best friend for 6 years, while she's been with you 6 months. She knows you and Sarah have a close bond that has developed over years and she hasn't known you for nearly as long.\n\nAnd it must have deeply hurt Ash to hear the people at the party to go on and on about how much you care for Sarah, since you showed it so obviously.\n\nI think deep down, you have feelings for Sarah more than for Ash, and Ash knows it.\n\nYTA", "YTA, look in the mirror and ask yourself honestly if your girlfriend went out of her way to console one of her best guy friends who \u201cjust had a hard breakup\u201d, would you be completely fine with it? Where would you draw the line? What if she wanted to fly out to where he lived to support him in his time of need?", "While I understand the gesture, you really did A LOT for Sarah. More than I would ever picture any of my friends, man or woman, doing for me.\n\nNormally I err on the the side of friendships, but the party on top of perfume and jewelry is really too much.\nSorry, man, YTA here.", "YTA. Perfume and a gold bracelet? Coordinating a big party like that? I get she's your best friend but the things you did for her and the gifts you gave were really boyfriend stuff. \n\nAnd you said it yourself: you put a lot more effort into it than you did for your girlfriend. She's not upset because you didn't do enough for her. She's upset because you went far over the top for someone else instead of her.", "YTA you put way more time and thought into Sarah maybe you should date her instead you clearly care about her more", "YTA. No guy puts in this much effort for a girl that they aren\u2019t trying to fuck. You\u2019re gf sees it and now the rest of your friends see it because you did it so publicly. Hopefully Sarah wants to date you when Ash dumps you. Because she should.", "I don't see where you mention getting a physical gift for your gf.  I see flowers, a trip (possibly a gift), some food.  No party, nothing personal to her other than a favorite lunch spot and dinner.  Yet for your friend you had to contact relatives, out of town friends. Coordinate travel and probably accommodations, food, decorations. You bought thoughtful gifts.  You basically gave your friend the girl friend experience and you gave your gf the friend experience.  So yes. YTA.  While both are nice you obviously spend more time and energy on the second bday.  Maybe if you had thrown the gf s party, skip the surf/turf, and bought her a gold bracelet that might have even the score.  They do say it's the thought that counts and you put way more thought into your friend than you did to your ex, or possibly soon to be ex.", "YTA, OP. Sarah may not be a romantic interest (yet?), but her very thoughtfully planned birthday celebration from you shows that the emotional spaces that Ash/romantic partner would occupy, are already taken up by Sarah/best friend. I don\u2019t know if you will pick up that nuance, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here and I won\u2019t be surprised if Ash breaks up with you. Eventually.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA. That\u2019s a lot of effort plus very personal gifts, that are typically given to someone by their partner. That\u2019s not to say that your gift to Ash wasn\u2019t lovely and appropriate, but in addition to the effort, you gifted another woman perfume and jewelry. It\u2019s understandable your girlfriend would be upset.", "Gonna say NAH/ESH maybe not so much the gf. A lot of people are gonna say she\u2019s insecure and tbh everyone is that\u2019s a normal part of building any relationship platonic or romantic. Having conversations about how the other persons actions make us feel and then coming together to find a solution and set boundaries is gonna be a consistent part of any successful relationship. She communicated that it was not the money/material aspect that mattered/bothered her but the time and effort and thoughtful consideration that went into planning. That\u2019s absolutely not saying you didn\u2019t also put time and consideration into her birthday as well but I do think there\u2019s a difference in the intentions behind both plans which I think might be it just hard to articulate. \n\nShe did enjoy her solo activities with you no where did she seem unappreciative to me at least. She probably felt so awful when you held the cost over her head that makes it seem like you think she cares only about the material aspects right after she told you it wasn\u2019t, kind of missed the mark with that one. Using her words to be like hey this made me uncomfortable doesn\u2019t make her unappreciative of the overall weekend happening (duality of emotions my guy). Did you do anything with her and her friends to celebrate her birthday? What did they do with her to also show her she\u2019s surrounded by love? \n \nEven just the right from the start, you gush so much about wanting to make Sarah feel special and loved and supported (nothing wrong with that ofc) but when you talk about your gf the energy is nonexistent. Clearly she picks up on that difference too. You didn\u2019t plan to go so overboard until this girl started crying about how you were going to get flowers and make dinner for your gf which idk that\u2019s my everyday routine with my partner so like for me that\u2019s like the baseline not super special occasion but not the point lol. Also personally i wouldn\u2019t make it about me being single in the middle of the conversation about celebrating my best friends partner on their birthday. That\u2019s like a separate conversation. There are so many ways to support a friend crying about wanting a bf on her birthday rather than actually playing bf for her. Cause specific perfume you had to research where to get,jewelry, a surprise party that required what seems like months of planning and spending the whole day together doing fun things kinda crosses over into partner territory.", "Idk if you\u2019re an AH or just clueless.  \n\nWhether you\u2019re into your friend or not, she\u2019s still threatening to your GF.  The smart thing to have done would have been to get your GF involved in the whole thing, make her a co-planner, party-thrower.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019re just gonna have to ride it out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've killed plants in 6 months before.", "Food and flowers \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "ETA. After rereading the post I realized why you did what you did.  You are a pathological people pleaser with a hero complex.  You want everyone to be happy but you are happiest swooping in to save the day and bring the good guy.  Not necessarily a bad trait. But as you have now seen, it can cause conflict and jealousy.  A gf, even one of six months should be higher on the bday scale than a friend.  But because of your need to make people happy you went overboard and unintentionally hurt your gf.  Time to apologize and maybe take a step back from your friend while you work on your relationship.", "Clueless would be too generous in this case. Right now, OP is just downright ignorant.", "100% disagree. He put so much effort into his best friend to make her feel special. I could understand the party, but then he got her perfume and a bracelet while not giving his girlfriend any jewelry. Partners can have friends of the opposite gender BUT there have to be limits on how far you go. Every time Sarah goes through a heartbreak, will OP go out of his way to try to make her feel special? No partner would stand for that. Heck, there are men out there who wouldn't stand to see their woman go through a lot of effort to make another man happy. I have been that woman with the guy who had the female best friend. Believe me, when she said jump, he jumped. It ruined our relationship.", "No No No, that is the worst thing to say to anyone. Because as the relationship progresses, then that will always be the case, but Sarah has always been in my life longer. My EX said that same shit to me before. Yeah, he is my EX now! It was a female friend that all of a sudden reappeared in his life, after us being together for 2.5 years. He made time for her, but not for us. And he told me he knew her longer than me. Let me tell you, that is one way to forever damage your relationship. Because they will always be in their life longer. It doesn\u2019t matter you are the one that stands by their side through all the good and bad, that you have loved and supported them throughout, you will NEVER have been in their life as long as that other person. \n\nSay that to anyone, then you deserve to be single.", "[deleted]", "But he could have gotten the girlfriend the bracelet vs. The friend. He pulled a boyfriend move with the best friend.", "Exaaaactly. Sarah knows damn well what she's doing. I'm pretty sure he's just clueless as many guys can be. A lot of guys don't know how women operate to embarrass the other.", "That was what got me, too. The party and everything I totally would have understood as a girlfriend of only 6 months, especially after everything he did to make Ash's birthday special and spend romantic time just the two of them. Hell, I would have encouraged him to support his bestie that way.\n\nBut perfume and gold jewelry? Those are deeply intimate presents; and they are definitely NOT presents you buy for your bestie when you have a romantic partner who isn't her. Not even if you call it a \"friendship bracelet\". I'm nearly 50, and my best friend is a guy, and married, and his wife jokes that I'm the \"other wife\" . . . but I wouldn't accept gold jewelry or perfume from  him as a birthday gift unless it was clearly from BOTH of them and she had been involved in picking it out. Those gifts were deeply inappropriate and far too romantic.", "I didn\u2019t think it was personal, I just know those are things she wanted", "If he didn\u2019t want to make it weird, he should have asked his girlfriend to go along and help pick out a gift for Sarah. They could have had a fun day shopping together and girlfriend would have felt more involved in the party. Especially if she doesn\u2019t know these people well, it would have been great for him to be able to say to Sarah oh yeah, Ash helped me pick this out. Could have been a good opportunity to help them foster a sense of friendship and make girlfriend feel like she was involved and helped too.", "But he did these actions because his friend heard all the boyfriend gestures he was doing for his actual gf and cried that she didn\u2019t have a bf to do that for her. So he did it. \n\nThat makes this story a bit squishy imo. It would be different if he always planned a party for her or did it just because.", "Or it is how OP is making her feel. Has he gone out of his way for Sarah in the past that is making the girlfriend question things a bit? We don't know. We only know of this one story. While I agree, we as women are very good at forming our own insecurities. However, they can also be brought on by our partners' actions. When Sarah and her bf broke up, was OP the one by her side comforting her, was Sarah always calling him because she needed someone to talk to and he always made time? As time goes on and these things progress, it can make the partner in the relationship feel uncomfortable and question his true priorities. It could be all Ash, or it could be OPs actions that go beyond the party that make her feel second. This is only one side of the story.", "So, by your logic, op could never be as emotionally invested with Ash as he is with Sarah?   Or when does the change happen?", "Right, like how happy would this guy be if ash ran of to her best guy friends house to cook him dinner and rub his feet after he got dumped? I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t get her lingerie to go with the perfume and Jewelery lol", "I call bullshit on this. \n\nYou're not accounting for the fact that as a relationship grows, people spend more time together. At some point if he's spending more time with you, he'd know more about you then his friend. But it also doesn't take that long to get to know someone to the point you can make a great party for them. \n\nIt really just sounds like you dated someone that didn't make you a priority and you're bitter and wanting to make everyone else as defensive as you are when some people have the social skills to maintain proper boundaries.", "\"I'm really really upset right now because you built a 3 ft sand castle with me and then you went over to your friend and helped her finish her 18ft sand castle.\"", "Idk, I wouldn't expect a gold bracelet from a guy I've been dating for only six months.", "She doesn\u2019t wear jewelry", "For real. As soon as I read \"she cried because she had no boyfriend to do anything special for her on her birthday\", instant reaction was \"OOOH, Sarah's a manipulater. Got it\". And OP is such a dumbass he doesn't even see it.", "They always act sweet and innocent, but they are deceitful to the core. Sorry, I dealt with a Sarah before in my life, and they are the worst type of women out there.", "Body spray is a decent throw-away gift for a female friend on her birthday. Eau de parfum, however, is usually a lot more expensive and a bigger deal.\n\nReal gold jewelry is not something to accept from a kept friend, though. My female friends would never do that for me! Probably not even the perfume. They might plan a party though.", "if she wanted the jewelry and perfume then it IS personal lmao, jewelry and perfume are very romantic gifts", "This is my take too. If he had said, \u201cHey gf, my bestie just went through a horrible breakup. I\u2019d like to perk her up for her birthday. Would you help me plan it?\u201d, they would be in a much different situation now. \n\nBut the perfume and jewelry and coordinating a bunch of different flights because \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend to do it for her\u201d would be humiliating for his gf. YTA.", "Omg! Right! I wonder if the OP has romantic feelings for Sarah. If I were the girlfriend, that would be my question before I started investing too much time into this relationship. The girlfriend should have gotten the bracelet at least...geeze. But if the boyfriend truly doesn't understand, then I would be questioning if I would want to be with someone so dense. \ud83e\udd23", "I'm not bitter at all actually \ud83d\ude0a In a really good place now. And you are right as relationships grow, you usually spend more time together, but sadly, that isn't the case for all relationships, not just me but others. Distance can grow, which creates issues and leads people to say hurtful things. That was our case. Words can really hurt, and stuff like that can really stick, especially if there is a bit of an issue you need to work through. I'm just saying, I don't think the healthy approach is to say, well they technically been in my life longer. It just creates more hurt and mature people who want healthy relationships and work on things in a healthy way, then they should try to avoid causing more hurt. In the beginning stages of relationships is when you really want to focus on developing healthy ways to resolve conflicts.\n\nBut you are probably going to call BS on this, too, right? You say I am bitter? You sound like an angry person who gets mad so easily when people disagree with you \ud83d\ude0a", "I really wouldn't either, but I could imagine it sucked for the girlfriend to the best friend receive some nice gifts.", "I think it\u2019s a stretch to say she\u2019s a manipulator\u2026", "But it want romantic personal. Like if a guy friend had been looking for something specific for more than a few weeks but couldn\u2019t get it, and I could I would get it for them as a gift.\n\nAs for the braclet, I thought rose gold wasn\u2019t a romantic gold?", "Right, which is why I said he probably would've been fine if he'd just thrown the party for her friend without the gift.        \n\nHonestly, I probably would've been weirded out if my guy friend gave me perfume and jewelry for my birthday. The only person who's ever given me perfume was my SO (I don't remember if we were engaged or married at the time, but it was definitely a serious relationship). I've also only received gold jewelry from my parents or a SO. I have a lot of good guy friends, but they'd be more likely to get me a case of my favorite beer or a gift card to a craft store.", "I get it, but ur offering PERFUME and JEWELRY to a girl! It\u2019s not just about what she wanted, you also need to think about context: a guy offering a girl those gifts is (almost) always seen as romantic. I get that u wanted to be a good friend, but perfume and jewelry have very romantic undertones, which is why your gf is sad"]}
