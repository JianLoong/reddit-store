We don\u2019t all love the same things, but the expectation we never eat our favorite foods is unreasonable.", "YTA I am vegetarian and my husband is not. If he cooks something with meat, he adds the meat at the last minute after setting aside a portion for me. If I cook something that he likes meat in, I cook that and add it at the last minute. If I am cooking dinner and there is something I really like that I know he doesn't, I make sure to have another dish on the table that he will eat, or I cook it at a time when we are not eating together. You are not obligated to always cook for your partner, and if you had told him he was on his own for dinner because you were making a favorite meal, that would have been ok (not nice but ok), but I think you expected that he would go ahead and eat it.", "YTA- I also have some food aversions, and it really isn\u2019t hard to leave one ingredient on the side for the sake of your partner. Add your mushrooms in at the end after his has come out.", "YTA\n\nThere is a specific ingredient that YOU CAN KEEP SEPARATE WHILE COOKING, and you are choosing not to... because, what, spite?\n\nWhy are you even with your partner if you clearly hate them?", "YTA. If you and your partner and agreeing on splitting the cooking then you should be making meals you both like and will eat. If you know he hates mushrooms this shouldn\u2019t be a dish you are cooking on your nights. In taking turns cooking you should be sharing the load, but instead you\u2019re making him make himself dinner on your nights as well. \n\nYou could only add the mushrooms to yours when you\u2019re cooking or you could talk to your partner about having nights where you each are responsible for your own dinners. That way you can eat what you like but he\u2019s fully aware that you don\u2019t have dinner covered.", "YTA \n\nNot that hard to set aside a portion of shroom free pasta for him.", "YTA, knowing he doesn\u2019t like mushrooms where there can be a simple solution is easy enough. \n\nI have a super picky eater partner (think like not having foods mixed together, minimal spice etc). I will usually keep some rice separate, broccoli separate and his main separate  while I make a casserole with the whole thing and add spice. It\u2019s simple enough to cook a bit etc that will be combined or to simply boil pasta etc and leave some chicken aside.  He often has to reheat his part but is okay with that. In fairness we only eat together 2-3 times a week and once is usually takeout. He makes his own lunches and dinners the other few nights (I like to batch cook casseroles and combined dishes for ease throughout the week).", "YTA. You knew he doesn't like it, there's nothing wrong with putting some chicken and pasta in a spare bowl. Or maybe have something else instead of mushroom.", "NAH. Yeah, he can make something for himself, but it sucks to come home to find your significant other made dinner... but only for themselves. next time just leave him an extra plate before adding mushrooms so he doesnt feel left out", "YTA\n\nIt takes like ten seconds to transfer a serving of pasta from one pot/bowl to another. You easily could have left him some plain pasta.", "Info can you not take a portion of pasta out before adding the sauce and serve him red sauce?", "If he knows you\u2019re making dinner for both of you and is expecting to kick back and enjoy a hot meal, then yes YTA.

He\u2019s right. The least you could do was leave plain pasta for him, but ideally splitting the sauce before adding mushrooms wouldn\u2019t have been so hard.", "YTA - my mom and I are mushroom people.

She does the same when cooking if there's coconut going in which I hate!", "When we make pasta, it's enough for that night and 2-4 days of lunches to take to work.\n\nIf this is the same for you two, then you just made 3-5 days of meals that he won't eat.

Act like it.\n\nAlso, you cooked last night, so he should be cooking tonight or he's TAH.", "YTA, if you split cooking and both agree that you are cooking for two, make something everybody likes.", "I have a question. Do you think that if you make mushrooms a lot, your BF will start to like them? It is not going to happen. All you are doing is making your BF feel that mushrooms are more important to you than he is. He is showing you this through his comment. I am wondering what else he is putting up with because you cannot compromise. I hate mushrooms and if someone kept putting them in my food, I would assume that my partner cares more about their wants than mine and I would be questioning my relationship.", "I'm gonna go with YTA simply because you split the chores and presuming he was under the impression you were making dinner. \n\nMy ex was like your bf. Didn't like mushrooms. Couldn't force her to eat em if I tried. So I didn't make stuff with mushrooms and if I did, I made myself a portion with mushrooms and hers without. \n\nMushrooms take 5 minutes to cook if you cook em right. They're not supposed to steep to stay in hot food long. If the promise is you're making dinner but just want him to suck it up or make something else, that kind of makes you an AH. It's not hard to set aside mushrooms. \n\nYou can also cook the mushrooms beforehand, put em in a bowl, then add to your pasta after you've portioned out some of it without. \n\nIt's not difficult in the slightest.", "My son in law hates onions, so I leave them out of food when he visits. When the kids were small I used to make coronation chicken a lot - my nephew and middle daughter didn't eat fruit, and my youngest daughter hates fruit in savoury dishes, so I would make a plate for them all without fruit - food is meant to be enjoyed, and mushrooms are a very flavourful vegetable and even if he picked them out, the food would still taste strongly of mushrooms. It doesn't take much to add the mushrooms to your half and omit them from his half.

He knows I love mushrooms and encourages me to eat more mushrooms but he just doesn't want to eat them because he doesn't like them. If I cook for the both of us and I want mushrooms in my plate, I just cook mushrooms separately and add them to my plate. It's a very small amount of effort to make both people happy and I honestly don't understand why you wouldn't do that if you loved your boyfriend.", "YTA\n\nI personally have trouble understanding your reasoning. \nJust slap something else on his pasta. Cut some cherry tomatoes, 2 leaves of basil and a bit of mozzarella and it\u2019s done. You eat your mushrooms and he can enjoy his dinner.\n\nI\u2019m vegetarian, my fiance is not. We take turns cooking. He makes me a vegetarian version of whatever he is eating. It\u2019s really not that hard", "YTA unless he does the same to you and purposely cooks food he knows you don't like then E S H. \n\nThere are some foods I love that my fianc\u00e8 hates and vice versa. Mushrooms is actually one of them, I hate them, he loves them. I love tofu, he hates it. \n\nWe mix up the cooking and when one of us cooks for the other we always make sure we cook something we both enjoy. Then once per week we make our own dish for ourselves. Why don't you do that?\n\nIt's not fair if every time he does the cooking he cooks something nice for both of you, but then your attitude is \"well I like it so I don't care if you eat or not\"", "YTA I always cook something we both enjoy, and when we go out to eat I get what I enjoy.", "I agree.  You could have put some plain pasta aside for him.", "YTA you and your husband. You should\u2019ve know you put some on the side. Me and my family members do that each other all the time.

Again y\u2019all are both assholes in this situation. \n\nEdit: He also might\u2019ve had a hard day and the dinner was probably the thing that broke him. It\u2019s like when you drop your keys when you get home after a rough day. It might not necessarily be dinner but everything else that occupied before it.", "NTA. Mushrooms are my number one hated food, but if someone else cooks a dish for me, I\u2019ll simply pick the mushrooms out without complaining since I didn\u2019t cook it.", "YTA - you know that he doesn't like something and YOU make no accomadation for that.  He presented a very reasonable work around, and you acted like HIS LIKES don't matter.\n\nLet's try this as a example, he wear Old Spice and you don't like it.  But he continues to wear it AND insists that it is the only 'perfume' you can use.  How would you feel about that?", "I hate mushrooms. My wife loves them. 99% of the time we make food with no mushrooms and 1% of the time my wife tells me to eat around them in the dish that she\u2019s craving. I always end up  eating them and getting over it quick. If she decided to crave mushroom dishes more often I would eat it without complaining.\n\nSometimes you have to suck it up", "Yeah NTA. Would it be nice if you make pasta without mushrooms? Sure, but there's no reason you have to, since you're not cooking it every time. He's a grown adult, he can make his own dinner. Or is he one of those guys that think cooking is 'women's work'?", "NTA. I guess people on reddit have never heard of fend for yourself nights. You should leave out plain pasta for him, that would be courteous, but ultimately it's not a big deal.", "YTA.  If you're responsible for cooking for the two of you then it's an AH move to make something he has SPECIFICALLY told you he doesn't like. \n\nI'm not saying you need to stop cooking it, but you should just make it for yourself. On one of the nights he is supposed to cook you should tell him to just cook something for himself and you'll make your mushroom dish. Or if it's your night to cook you need to make two dishes.\n\nHere's the deal about living with a partner.  You have to compromise on things and you need to be thoughtful.  What you're telling him in this situation is that his opinions/preferences don't matter to you and you don't care if he has to suffer.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nYou know he doesn't like mushrooms. There are probably lots of foods that you both like that you could cook instead. Is making a meal with an ingredient your bf actively avoids some sort of power play that you won't even add the mushrooms in separately?", "YTA you want to have mushroom pasta for dinner? Have mushroom pasta, but if you split cooking and he\u2019s under the assumption that you\u2019re making dinner that night, you need to give him a warning so he can arrange something else. If I came home looking forward to a nice home cooked dinner only to find out last minute that there was no food for me to eat and I\u2019d either have to pull something together or order out, I\u2019d be pissed.", "YTA. Not adding the mushrooms to a small part of the pasta takes no effort on your part. Learn to compromise here.", "Info- was it something you made for just yourself, or was it supposed to be dinner for you both?", "NTA. If he doesn't like it , he can make his own meal. My wife didn't like about 1/4 of the meals I could cook and felt I should never make them again, ever. I refused to stop making them cause about 1/4 of what she made I didn't like. When she made her meals, she would tell me to eat her food or make my own. So I would make my favorites and tell her the same. Somehow when I made food she didn't like, I was the asshole. When she made her meals I didn't like, I needed 'to expand my horizons'.", "YTA.  He's made it clear he doesn't eat mushrooms because he doesn't like it.  You've known this about him for quite a while.  What's the big deal with making the dish without mushrooms, putting his portion to the side, and then adding the mushrooms to your own portion?  You're creating a problem in your relationship that is easily avoided.  Part of any successful relationship includes making compromises for/with the person you love.  How would you feel if your bf kept making a dish he likes to eat but you can't stand?  Sorry to say this but it's selfish.  Make the dish for yourself when he's not going to be around to eat dinner with you or, make the simple adjustment to leave mushrooms out of his portion.", ">but he said I should've put some away before adding the mushrooms or just left plain pasta for him\n\nWhy are you not doing this? This is a good compromise. A relationship is supposed to be an equal partnership not a 'I like it, I do it, you deal with it' thing. YTA", "YTA I cannot imagine making my partner a meal that I know he hates continually just to save me the slight hassle of separating some into different pots.

Cook the mushrooms in a separate pan make the sauce without the mushroom. Divide it in 2. Use half and mix his pasta and serve him. Then add your half to the pan add the mushrooms and then the pasta and enjoy. YTA.\n\nEdit: it has happened that my husband will like a dish spicier than me so I separate it in 2 pans and make his spicier. Not that big of a deal to use 2 pans come on. If it\u2019s too much make him clean it but this is really argument that shouldn\u2019t happen", "The only thing that makes you an A here is that you two split chores- so if you cook, and he does the dishes for example, that\u2019s fair. But if you cook something he won\u2019t eat knowing he doesn\u2019t like it, and then he didn\u2019t do the dishes (or laundry or whatever his chores were that day), you\u2019d probably be calling him petty or get upset. If your chosen chore that day is cooking for both of you, then make something for both of you. If you want to each only do your own things, your own dishes, your own laundry, your own cooking, then make all the mushroom pasta for yourself in the world. \nYTA only on that detail.", "YTA \n\nWe\u2019re you supposed to cook dinner for the both of you? \n\nYou seem wildly inconsiderate", "YTA. There are so many compromises here. Make a big batch or two of sauce and just heat up enough for each of you, for example. My wife loves mushrooms. They make me sick. So she gets mushroom sauces when she eats out, or makes herself small portions separately.", "Soft YTA because it\u2019s easy enough to take aside plain pasta for him, but I also know what it\u2019s like to cook a favorite meal only to have someone disparage it and that can be super annoying when they could just make something themselves. Maybe next time you want your favorite meal you just ask him to make his own or have leftovers ready that he can have.", "Sorry, but this is so funny. A grown man not understanding the concept of a woman cooking and eating for her own pleasure.\n\nNTA\n\nHe has to learn that you are allowed to do things just to please yourself with no second thoughts for him (as long as you don't hurt him, but I guess him having to cook is not active BF endangerment).", "YTA. Why are only making something that he doesn't like? I don't like mushrooms, and never had a boyfriend make something with mushrooms, when making food for the both of us.

You were being stubborn about cooking your meal and ignoring your BF's preferences.\n\nYou know your BF doesn't like this thing, and by your own admission you make it often (but slightly less often).  You making something that you like but your BF doesn't enjoy is not an issue until that second part.... on your night to cook you left him to fend for himself.  You could have set his portion aside and only added mushrooms to your part (so you get extra!).  You could have left him some plain pasta and made a quick sauce for him (olive oil + garlic + herbs takes about 30 seconds).  You chose not to do neither of those things and left him to eat something you know he dislikes or fix himself a meal.\n\nThis is not a new issue unique to your relationship.

There was an easy solution to this that would have been the kind thing to do, which seems like what you'd want since you are married to the guy. Instead, you doubled down.

Is that a tad too much to ask for? \nI personally say YTA. They split their chores, so they should also be considerate with one another when doing so.", "Exactly.  My dad makes the most awesome spaghetti, but when he spices the sauce, it's too much for my sister's stomach. Whenever he makes it, he sets aside some of the basic sauce, before he goes crazy on the flavors, so she c as n eat with everyone. When she was a kid, he told her it was her \"special sauce\" so she didn't feel bad that she had to have different sauce. Even today, she'll say \"You didn't forget my special sauce, did you?\" It's not hard to do something easy like that, for someone you love. YTA", "This. Frankly, folks, I eat what my partner typically prefers because she's picky. Over time, her tastes have expanded, but it's worth a happy household and she never gave me shit for it. She's just not good at cooking and I feel bad when she wouldn't eat much.\n\nBut, I think OP is a strong YTA because the solutions here are really simple and take simple steps to work together for a happy home. BF is a bit rude how he's handling this, but OP, in your shared home, work together, not against each other. Both of you should be trying to find shared solutions.", "Yes! Exactly this! I've been married for 15 years & there are things that I love & my husband doesn't. I hardly make those things but if I'm craving it, I will let him know ahead of time & ask him if he would like me to cook him something else that night or pick something else up from the store for him. Most of the time he makes himself a sandwich or I put a pizza in the oven for him. The main thing is that I let him know beforehand so he knows what to expect when he gets home. \n\nIt's called communication. It works great.\n\nOP, YTA.", "Exactly this. In my case, for example, my youngest and I can't handle spicy foods. While my husband and eldest llooooove spice. The hotter the better \n\nSo for some foods I cook it, then separate towards the end, add the heat to the part for husband and eldest. It hardly adds any more work. My husband also loves mushrooms, while the rest of us don't. So I just add them to his part. Or cook them separately and add thim to his plate. It is NBD", "This find a compromise nta", " But you warn your husband in advance so clearly he knows something he doesn\u2019t like is being made and he can prepare his own meal. OP just makes the food and tells her bf to eat up or go make something else without a heads up. Op sounds like Ta to me. Lets not forget OP had the option to just set aside the pasta before adding mushrooms but she just brushed it aside", "Technically yes, but I'd have to separate the sauce base into 2 pans, add mushrooms to one and leave the other. The cooking is one day me, next day him, day after me, etc. Once or twice a week, and no he doesn't.", "But would you want to do this twice a week every week? According to the comments, they switch off cooking and op makes this dish every other time she cooks.", "If you've told someone 20 times you don't like mushrooms and they still give you mushrooms it's fair to \"throw a tantrum\" as the person is telling you the value they put on you is zero!", "She didn\u2019t do him any favors by making him a homemade meal for him if he doesn\u2019t like it. Its not like he doesn\u2019t cook. They both split the cooking. Why continue making him food he doesn\u2019t like? The bf was right she could have just added mushrooms afterwards for herself", "it wont work like this\n\nmushrooms isn't a topping its a sauce. she's got to cook them in the dish to have the thickener pick up the taste.", "1. I can't really do that, I need to add the mushrooms to the actual sauce for the flavor to come through.\n2. No\n3. Sometimes when he works late, but that's not usual", "Maybe.  But I cook with mushrooms a lot, and those dishes very often start with the mushrooms.  They're one of the first things to go in, and they flavor the sauce.  Like, maybe she could cook the mushrooms in a separate pan and add them at the end, but it might not be that simple.", "Or make it when he\u2019s not there. Me and my boyfriend both have things we enjoy that the other doesn\u2019t like so we get those things when we aren\u2019t eating together or we\u2019re at a restaurant where we can order two different things. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t like meatloaf so I get it at restaurants or make it when he\u2019s out of town. I cannot imagine making it twice a week and telling him to suck it up, that\u2019s so inconsiderate.", "They split cooking 50/50 and OP stated in her comments that she makes mushroom pasta once or twice a week. That's basically half of the time she cooks she's excluding her BF and making him cook for himself. She's 100% YTA", "No I didn\u2019t know that. Thank you for the info. I\u2019ve seen it before but I\u2019ve just read as like an expression. Thanks", "It's reasonable to think that a person would cook for both, but it can't be rigid. I hate my husband's favorite food. It's a quick conversation whenever he wants it for dinner. \n\"Any plans for dinner? No, cool. I'm making Ramen.\" Or \"yes? Would you mind if I made Ramen?\"", "They both ate it. OP also says that they \"split chores, including cooking.\" \n\nSplitting chores does not mean hey, I'll cook something I know you don't like so you can just go cook your own. Splitting chores means cooking food that works for both people. That's kinda the whole point of splitting chores. \n\nYour last contention about him being over dramatic--I see it the opposite way. Agree to disagree.", "I don't notice the taste... to me they don't really taste like anything, but I don't like the texture.....I just eat around them.", "I mean we try not to make contentious dishes more than once a month.", "I appreciate the comment, thank you. You\u2019re absolutely correct in that, I was trying to explain that as best I could in my own comment, but I explained it very poorly & didn\u2019t take into consideration that she\u2019s making the meal without notifying the bf beforehand.", "I\u2019m sorry. Am I reading this right? You basically split cooking 50/50. So you cook 3 or 4 times a week and 1 or 2 of those times it\u2019s mushroom pasta??", "That's.... really not that much of a hassle and I can't believe you're making it sound like one. Basically all you'd have to do is put aside some sauce for him.", "If it's your favorite food and it's too complicated to make one with one without (which I get -- my sister is vegetarian and I hate cooking my favorite recipe for both of us because it's like three times as much work) I would say talk to him about how often he's okay with you making it, and find some sort of compromise like a heads up so he can order takeout, or you setting aside pasta with no sauce and letting him just add some sauce from a jar from the grocery store or something? As long as it's not too often I feel like you'll find some middle ground that works for both of you.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm reading wrong when you say once or twice a week though... if you cook every other day, are you saying you make a dish he hates almost every time you cook? I think I must be misreading haha but if I'm not that's definitely too often", "If using two pans is too much for you the answer is don't make the mushroom pasta. Sucks to be him for 1/3 or 1/2 the meals you cook a week is not a good solution.\n\n My mind is blown that you characterized something you make every single week as \"I don't make it that often\".  Making a dish you know he doesn't like every single week is an incredibly selfish move. YTA", "So there is a soup I make that involves lemon juice at the end. My kid hates that part, so I separate some for her before I add it. But that doesn\u2019t work with everything, so in this case, I recommend cooking it when he is away or giving him a heads up so he can get takeout.", "My husband, my son and I all have different diets due to health and sensory issues. \nIf I can make a sauce base, split it into *three* different pots, and make everyone a meal they like, why is it difficult? Especially when you not only just do half the cooking (half the actual work) *AND* he doesn't make things you don't like. \n\nPut in the same effort he puts in for you. Either stop making things he hates, or adapt your cooking methods to make you both happy at dinner.", "I'd still eat the dish. Who knows, I may grow to love mushrooms. I'd eat it out of love for my partner. When you love someone, you learn to love the things they love", "I don\u2019t think that matters since boyfriend asked why OP couldn\u2019t even set aside some plain noodles before adding them to the mushroom sauce. Set plain noodles aside, have a jar of premise sauce for bf or even just butter, Parmesan and pepper. It would be so easy to do something.", "OP did not say that in her post. \"Chicken and mushroom pasta\" could mean quite a lot of things. Hence my question to *her.*", "Don't you care about your bf? I couldn't imagine doing what you do, intentionally cooking food I know my partner hates and telling them to cook their own food if they don't like it...sheesh! \n\nJust break up with the guy if you don't like him.", "The fact that #2 is no means YTA. When you\u2019re cooking dinner, you\u2019re cooking for him and yourself, not just yourself. The fact he always makes sure to cook something you like should tell you that this behavior is rude and selfish", "Exactly. Why split cooking 50/50 if one person doesn't eat the cooked dish. If it's someone's turn to cook it should be something both people enjoy otherwise you're just cooking for yourself and not caring about the other person.", "No problem! NAH is an option too (no asshole here) that's one I read as an expression for a long time.", "Sure, and the whole situation is all solvable with some adult-like conversation. Like you say here, or she could take the opportunity to cook mushrooms whenever there is leftovers for the bf to eat instead. This seems like such a silly thing to fight over.", "Well I guess you are right if we're talking about champignons. I was thinking about wild mushrooms, those have a strong smell and taste even fresh, but especially dried. \n\nMy grandpa's favourite past time is mushroom picking and I've been going with him for years, but then I hardly eat what I pick lol", "Exactly, YOU don't notice the taste and to YOU they don't really taste like anything.  However, it may be a complete different story for OP's bf.", "Exactly. I don't know anyone that would categorize something they make every single week as not that often. Once a month with some warning is reasonable. \n\nOp also said they alternate days on cooking. So one third or one half of op's days to cook is the mushroom pasta. I'd get pissy too if I was op's partner .", "twice a week, so 2/7 of the meals cooked in the house a week are something he doesn't like.", "Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaahahahahhaahahahahahahahhaahahahhahahahahahaahahahahhahahahahahah are you for real?", "When you love someone and split cooking duties, you don\u2019t regularly cook something you know they don\u2019t like."]}
