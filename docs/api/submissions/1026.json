We don\u2019t all love the same things, but the expectation we never eat our favorite foods is unreasonable.", "YTA I am vegetarian and my husband is not. If he cooks something with meat, he adds the meat at the last minute after setting aside a portion for me. If I cook something that he likes meat in, I cook that and add it at the last minute. If I am cooking dinner and there is something I really like that I know he doesn't, I make sure to have another dish on the table that he will eat, or I cook it at a time when we are not eating together. You are not obligated to always cook for your partner, and if you had told him he was on his own for dinner because you were making a favorite meal, that would have been ok (not nice but ok), but I think you expected that he would go ahead and eat it.", "YTA- I also have some food aversions, and it really isn\u2019t hard to leave one ingredient on the side for the sake of your partner. Add your mushrooms in at the end after his has come out.", "YTA\n\nThere is a specific ingredient that YOU CAN KEEP SEPARATE WHILE COOKING, and you are choosing not to... because, what, spite?\n\nWhy are you even with your partner if you clearly hate them?", "YTA. If you and your partner and agreeing on splitting the cooking then you should be making meals you both like and will eat. If you know he hates mushrooms this shouldn\u2019t be a dish you are cooking on your nights. In taking turns cooking you should be sharing the load, but instead you\u2019re making him make himself dinner on your nights as well. \n\nYou could only add the mushrooms to yours when you\u2019re cooking or you could talk to your partner about having nights where you each are responsible for your own dinners. That way you can eat what you like but he\u2019s fully aware that you don\u2019t have dinner covered.", "YTA \n\nNot that hard to set aside a portion of shroom free pasta for him.", "YTA, knowing he doesn\u2019t like mushrooms where there can be a simple solution is easy enough. \n\nI have a super picky eater partner (think like not having foods mixed together, minimal spice etc). I will usually keep some rice separate, broccoli separate and his main separate  while I make a casserole with the whole thing and add spice. It\u2019s simple enough to cook a bit etc that will be combined or to simply boil pasta etc and leave some chicken aside.  He often has to reheat his part but is okay with that. In fairness we only eat together 2-3 times a week and once is usually takeout. He makes his own lunches and dinners the other few nights (I like to batch cook casseroles and combined dishes for ease throughout the week).", "YTA. You knew he doesn't like it, there's nothing wrong with putting some chicken and pasta in a spare bowl. Or maybe have something else instead of mushroom.", "NAH. Yeah, he can make something for himself, but it sucks to come home to find your significant other made dinner... but only for themselves. next time just leave him an extra plate before adding mushrooms so he doesnt feel left out", "YTA\n\nIt takes like ten seconds to transfer a serving of pasta from one pot/bowl to another. You easily could have left him some plain pasta.", "Info can you not take a portion of pasta out before adding the sauce and serve him red sauce?", "If he knows you\u2019re making dinner for both of you and is expecting to kick back and enjoy a hot meal, then yes YTA.

He\u2019s right. The least you could do was leave plain pasta for him, but ideally splitting the sauce before adding mushrooms wouldn\u2019t have been so hard.", "YTA - my mom and I are mushroom people.

She does the same when cooking if there's coconut going in which I hate!", "When we make pasta, it's enough for that night and 2-4 days of lunches to take to work.\n\nIf this is the same for you two, then you just made 3-5 days of meals that he won't eat.

Act like it.\n\nAlso, you cooked last night, so he should be cooking tonight or he's TAH.", "YTA, if you split cooking and both agree that you are cooking for two, make something everybody likes.", "I have a question. Do you think that if you make mushrooms a lot, your BF will start to like them? It is not going to happen. All you are doing is making your BF feel that mushrooms are more important to you than he is. He is showing you this through his comment. I am wondering what else he is putting up with because you cannot compromise. I hate mushrooms and if someone kept putting them in my food, I would assume that my partner cares more about their wants than mine and I would be questioning my relationship.", "I'm gonna go with YTA simply because you split the chores and presuming he was under the impression you were making dinner. \n\nMy ex was like your bf. Didn't like mushrooms. Couldn't force her to eat em if I tried. So I didn't make stuff with mushrooms and if I did, I made myself a portion with mushrooms and hers without. \n\nMushrooms take 5 minutes to cook if you cook em right. They're not supposed to steep to stay in hot food long. If the promise is you're making dinner but just want him to suck it up or make something else, that kind of makes you an AH. It's not hard to set aside mushrooms. \n\nYou can also cook the mushrooms beforehand, put em in a bowl, then add to your pasta after you've portioned out some of it without. \n\nIt's not difficult in the slightest.", "My son in law hates onions, so I leave them out of food when he visits. When the kids were small I used to make coronation chicken a lot - my nephew and middle daughter didn't eat fruit, and my youngest daughter hates fruit in savoury dishes, so I would make a plate for them all without fruit - food is meant to be enjoyed, and mushrooms are a very flavourful vegetable and even if he picked them out, the food would still taste strongly of mushrooms. It doesn't take much to add the mushrooms to your half and omit them from his half.

He knows I love mushrooms and encourages me to eat more mushrooms but he just doesn't want to eat them because he doesn't like them. If I cook for the both of us and I want mushrooms in my plate, I just cook mushrooms separately and add them to my plate. It's a very small amount of effort to make both people happy and I honestly don't understand why you wouldn't do that if you loved your boyfriend.", "YTA\n\nI personally have trouble understanding your reasoning. \nJust slap something else on his pasta. Cut some cherry tomatoes, 2 leaves of basil and a bit of mozzarella and it\u2019s done. You eat your mushrooms and he can enjoy his dinner.\n\nI\u2019m vegetarian, my fiance is not. We take turns cooking. He makes me a vegetarian version of whatever he is eating. It\u2019s really not that hard", "YTA unless he does the same to you and purposely cooks food he knows you don't like then E S H. \n\nThere are some foods I love that my fianc\u00e8 hates and vice versa. Mushrooms is actually one of them, I hate them, he loves them. I love tofu, he hates it. \n\nWe mix up the cooking and when one of us cooks for the other we always make sure we cook something we both enjoy. Then once per week we make our own dish for ourselves. Why don't you do that?\n\nIt's not fair if every time he does the cooking he cooks something nice for both of you, but then your attitude is \"well I like it so I don't care if you eat or not\"", "YTA I always cook something we both enjoy, and when we go out to eat I get what I enjoy.", "I agree.  You could have put some plain pasta aside for him.", "YTA you and your husband. You should\u2019ve know you put some on the side. Me and my family members do that each other all the time.

Again y\u2019all are both assholes in this situation. \n\nEdit: He also might\u2019ve had a hard day and the dinner was probably the thing that broke him. It\u2019s like when you drop your keys when you get home after a rough day. It might not necessarily be dinner but everything else that occupied before it.", "NTA. Mushrooms are my number one hated food, but if someone else cooks a dish for me, I\u2019ll simply pick the mushrooms out without complaining since I didn\u2019t cook it.", "YTA - you know that he doesn't like something and YOU make no accomadation for that.  He presented a very reasonable work around, and you acted like HIS LIKES don't matter.\n\nLet's try this as a example, he wear Old Spice and you don't like it.  But he continues to wear it AND insists that it is the only 'perfume' you can use.  How would you feel about that?", "I hate mushrooms. My wife loves them. 99% of the time we make food with no mushrooms and 1% of the time my wife tells me to eat around them in the dish that she\u2019s craving. I always end up  eating them and getting over it quick. If she decided to crave mushroom dishes more often I would eat it without complaining.\n\nSometimes you have to suck it up", "Yeah NTA. Would it be nice if you make pasta without mushrooms? Sure, but there's no reason you have to, since you're not cooking it every time. He's a grown adult, he can make his own dinner. Or is he one of those guys that think cooking is 'women's work'?", "NTA. I guess people on reddit have never heard of fend for yourself nights. You should leave out plain pasta for him, that would be courteous, but ultimately it's not a big deal.", "YTA.  If you're responsible for cooking for the two of you then it's an AH move to make something he has SPECIFICALLY told you he doesn't like. \n\nI'm not saying you need to stop cooking it, but you should just make it for yourself. On one of the nights he is supposed to cook you should tell him to just cook something for himself and you'll make your mushroom dish. Or if it's your night to cook you need to make two dishes.\n\nHere's the deal about living with a partner.  You have to compromise on things and you need to be thoughtful.  What you're telling him in this situation is that his opinions/preferences don't matter to you and you don't care if he has to suffer.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nYou know he doesn't like mushrooms. There are probably lots of foods that you both like that you could cook instead. Is making a meal with an ingredient your bf actively avoids some sort of power play that you won't even add the mushrooms in separately?", "YTA you want to have mushroom pasta for dinner? Have mushroom pasta, but if you split cooking and he\u2019s under the assumption that you\u2019re making dinner that night, you need to give him a warning so he can arrange something else. If I came home looking forward to a nice home cooked dinner only to find out last minute that there was no food for me to eat and I\u2019d either have to pull something together or order out, I\u2019d be pissed.", "YTA. Not adding the mushrooms to a small part of the pasta takes no effort on your part. Learn to compromise here.", "Info- was it something you made for just yourself, or was it supposed to be dinner for you both?", "NTA. If he doesn't like it , he can make his own meal. My wife didn't like about 1/4 of the meals I could cook and felt I should never make them again, ever. I refused to stop making them cause about 1/4 of what she made I didn't like. When she made her meals, she would tell me to eat her food or make my own. So I would make my favorites and tell her the same. Somehow when I made food she didn't like, I was the asshole. When she made her meals I didn't like, I needed 'to expand my horizons'.", "YTA.  He's made it clear he doesn't eat mushrooms because he doesn't like it.  You've known this about him for quite a while.  What's the big deal with making the dish without mushrooms, putting his portion to the side, and then adding the mushrooms to your own portion?  You're creating a problem in your relationship that is easily avoided.  Part of any successful relationship includes making compromises for/with the person you love.  How would you feel if your bf kept making a dish he likes to eat but you can't stand?  Sorry to say this but it's selfish.  Make the dish for yourself when he's not going to be around to eat dinner with you or, make the simple adjustment to leave mushrooms out of his portion.", ">but he said I should've put some away before adding the mushrooms or just left plain pasta for him\n\nWhy are you not doing this? This is a good compromise. A relationship is supposed to be an equal partnership not a 'I like it, I do it, you deal with it' thing. YTA", "YTA I cannot imagine making my partner a meal that I know he hates continually just to save me the slight hassle of separating some into different pots.

Cook the mushrooms in a separate pan make the sauce without the mushroom. Divide it in 2. Use half and mix his pasta and serve him. Then add your half to the pan add the mushrooms and then the pasta and enjoy. YTA.\n\nEdit: it has happened that my husband will like a dish spicier than me so I separate it in 2 pans and make his spicier. Not that big of a deal to use 2 pans come on. If it\u2019s too much make him clean it but this is really argument that shouldn\u2019t happen", "The only thing that makes you an A here is that you two split chores- so if you cook, and he does the dishes for example, that\u2019s fair. But if you cook something he won\u2019t eat knowing he doesn\u2019t like it, and then he didn\u2019t do the dishes (or laundry or whatever his chores were that day), you\u2019d probably be calling him petty or get upset. If your chosen chore that day is cooking for both of you, then make something for both of you. If you want to each only do your own things, your own dishes, your own laundry, your own cooking, then make all the mushroom pasta for yourself in the world. \nYTA only on that detail.", "YTA \n\nWe\u2019re you supposed to cook dinner for the both of you? \n\nYou seem wildly inconsiderate", "YTA. There are so many compromises here. Make a big batch or two of sauce and just heat up enough for each of you, for example. My wife loves mushrooms. They make me sick. So she gets mushroom sauces when she eats out, or makes herself small portions separately.", "Soft YTA because it\u2019s easy enough to take aside plain pasta for him, but I also know what it\u2019s like to cook a favorite meal only to have someone disparage it and that can be super annoying when they could just make something themselves. Maybe next time you want your favorite meal you just ask him to make his own or have leftovers ready that he can have.", "Sorry, but this is so funny. A grown man not understanding the concept of a woman cooking and eating for her own pleasure.\n\nNTA\n\nHe has to learn that you are allowed to do things just to please yourself with no second thoughts for him (as long as you don't hurt him, but I guess him having to cook is not active BF endangerment).", "YTA. Why are only making something that he doesn't like? I don't like mushrooms, and never had a boyfriend make something with mushrooms, when making food for the both of us.

You were being stubborn about cooking your meal and ignoring your BF's preferences.\n\nYou know your BF doesn't like this thing, and by your own admission you make it often (but slightly less often).  You making something that you like but your BF doesn't enjoy is not an issue until that second part.... on your night to cook you left him to fend for himself.  You could have set his portion aside and only added mushrooms to your part (so you get extra!).  You could have left him some plain pasta and made a quick sauce for him (olive oil + garlic + herbs takes about 30 seconds).  You chose not to do neither of those things and left him to eat something you know he dislikes or fix himself a meal.\n\nThis is not a new issue unique to your relationship.

When I do make my favorite things at home, I make sure that there are other options for him or separate his portion before adding the offending ingredient.  When he makes his favorite things, he does the same.  We even do the same with the kids because they get to have flavor preferences.

So when he wants something spicy I will cook dinner and he adds the spice after, or I cook two separate sets of the same meal so he can have his spicy.\n\nYou know he don't like mushrooms yet you keep making it, and not separating some for him without.sounds to me you are being selfish.", "YTA I recently realised I was T A for doing this in my own relationship, I do all the cooking but my partner HATES pasta, usually I make him a separate meal but we couldn't afford it last week and I was craving beef cheek pappardelle, I made it, and he struggled to eat it, I felt pretty shitty afterward as he said he would never force me to eat prawns or something I hated just because he was craving it, and he was right! I am pregnant and honestly just thought once wouldn't kill him but it's not really the point, I knew he hated it and made it anyway and it was a sucky thing to do. It really comes down to respect I think.", "YTA For not making him a mushroom free portion. It\u2019s not that hard.", "YTA Why do you do this?  Would you do this to a friend?", "YTA", "Yta\nYou know he doesn't like it, why not make something you both will eat or make him something different. You are so selfish and he should pay attention before getting married to you", "YTA, he is right.  It was such a basic, simple thing for you to do that cost you little to no effort. \n\nBut you didn\u2019t do the simplest thing for him", "It\u2019s really not a small thing. It\u2019s representative of you being self-centered.

Why would you live with someone if you don\u2019t care enough to do something super small that makes them happy? Cooking for someone means taking into consideration everyone\u2019s likes and dislikes and finding a happy medium. If you need to have mushrooms (as I do, I love them!), you can add them after. Or set one night per week that\u2019s planned as \u201ceveryone for themselves\u201d - you each cook what you like or get takeout or whatever. Not just having him show up after work thinking you\u2019ve made dinner for both of you, and you\u2019ve actually cooked the one thing you know he won\u2019t eat.", "YTA. Both my husband and I cook and neither one of us cooks with ingredients that the other person dislikes. Save it for one he isn\u2019t home for dinner.", "YTA\n\nWhen you make food for both of you then its basic ettiquette that you don't make food the other person dislikes tha you know they don't like! If you didn't know then that's one thing, but the fact that you knew and you still made it anyways makes you TA!", "OK, YTA. I once made a pasta I love, honey and shrimp. My nephew was over and he LOVES shrimp. I was in process and he asked my to not put the shrimp in the pasta because if he didn't like it the shrimp would be \"ruined\" for him. But I knew best. I loved the recipe and he would too. Except he didn't, so I made a meal he hated, when if I had just listened, we both would have been happy. I was totally the AH.   \nIf your boyfriend has said he would be happy if you just cooked a portion of plain pasta while you cooked yours for the chicken & mushroom how is that hurting you? It is literally no extra work as you just put in a little more pasta and leave a portion of pasta in the strainer for him as you take your share out to put in your sauce. If you want to be nice, it is very little effort to cook a bit of chicken in canned pesto or sauce for his meal, but he's not even asking for that according to you.", "YTA. My husband doesn't like corn, so I either don't make dishes with corn, or I only add it into my own portions.", "YTA \n\nHe doesn\u2019t like mushrooms, he\u2019s asked you to just put some aside before you add the mushrooms, etc. Its not hard to do that and to take that kind of consideration into account when you\u2019re making a shared meal to enjoy with your spouse. Just scoop his pasta out like he\u2019s asked and then add your mushrooms to the pot for yours. No big deal really. He isn\u2019t saying you can\u2019t have your mushrooms or make this dish, just that he can\u2019t eat it this way so here\u2019s an easy alternative.\n\nIf he was asking you to make a different dish entirely then my response would be different, but he\u2019s been vocal about mushrooms and is just asking that you set plain pasta aside for him. A little kindness to remove his portion from the mix before making it inedible for him isn\u2019t a big ask and would have gone a long way to show him that his enjoyment of dinner is also important to you.", "YTA - my wife hates game meats, which I love, but I wait until I have a night by myself to cook it for myself.\n\nMushrooms are disgusting", "nta, never bite the hand that feeds you.", "maybe it was edited since you posted, but they take turns doing the cooking and this was her night to cook for both of them and a dish she makes often, knowing he hates mushrooms", "maybe it was edited since you posted, or you didn't read that this is on her night to cook for both of them and something she's made multiple times knowing he doesn't like mushrooms", "Exactly. She also said in a comment she could make the pasta without mushrooms, all she needs is a 2nd pan for the mushroomless sauce. But she doesn't wanna do this. She's trying to make this look harder than it actually is", "Yeah, that's what stood out to me too. The total refusal to compromise or use empathy immediately after moving in together.

But learning to like mushrooms can be HARD. For most of my life I've been able to stomach just about every food except mushrooms. Finally, a few years ago I decided to try to learn to like them, so I cooked mushrooms in various ways once a week for a year, and I now tolerate them. But mostly if they are oyster mushrooms, heated in a dry pan until they're almost completely desiccated, and then fried in butter with smoked hot paprika. Basically, all mushroom texture and flavor must be eradicated.", "Sounds like she does not care as long as she is pleased", "YTA but this comment is insane. Y\u2019all are drama.", "It\u2019s a subtle way of forcing him to eat them, likely in the hopes that he\u2019ll learn to like them. I did \u201cforce\u201d my kids to taste and sometimes eat things they disliked when they were young, as it does take some time for tastebuds to develop and learn, but I made sure to focus mostly on nutrition and making sure they ate well and were exposed to a variety of foods. And I couldn\u2019t always capitulate when cooking for a family of four, as there is almost always something someone doesn\u2019t like about most meals. But two adults? He\u2019s not a toddler, and she needs to have more respect for his autonomy. It\u2019s too easy to make something he would actually enjoy\u2014she has to be doing it to punish him for not liking mushrooms.\n\nI do want her recipe, though\u2026", "I absolutely adore all kinds of seafood.

And we\u2019re fellow mushroom/no mushroom people. \nIt\u2019s not hard to separate a few servings out.", "Soft YTA cuz he is right.  You should have put a portion aside before adding mushrooms.  Most recipes that I make with mushrooms call for sauteing the mushrooms separately, then adding the other ingredients.  You could saute the mushrooms, empty the pan into a bowl, make the rest of the chicken/sauce, add pasta, portion the meal and add mushrooms to your plate.", "YTA, you say he can make something else himself, but why can't you make the mushroom dish for yourself on a night when your BF is cooking?", "YTA. You agreed to split cooking, yet he is forced to cook anyway because you knowingly and intentionally insist on cooking something he doesn't like.

They next time she made burgers, she made a mark in the cheese and told me that she squeezed some of the juices out while she was grilling it so that it didn\u2019t make my bun soggy.

Double she\u2019s the AH since this dish is soooo easy to accommodate him with", "This! I cook often so I understand most mushroom based sauces requires you to cook the mushrooms early on in the dish so there\u2019s no way to set aside a sauce without them. But she couldve bought a jarred sauce and make him a separate pasta at the very least, like that is just one extra pan, or she couldn\u2019t told him ahead of time so he could get takeout. Like I don\u2019t think she should have to go without this dish or mushrooms because he doesn\u2019t like it, but there is surly a way to compromise here.

The same can be done with the chicken for this particular recipe - cook fully separately but plain and set aside to be added into the sauce.
