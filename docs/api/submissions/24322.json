We are by the sea and yesterday was the first time we\u2019d be going to a beach club. \n\nMy sister asked me not to wear a bikini or anything revealing because she said both she and Adam are not feeling the best about her postpartum body and she really doesn\u2019t want to bring the topic up. I said I was sorry she feels that way but I wasn\u2019t going to spend a day roasting under an umbrella, unable to swim or enjoy myself. I said tons of women would be in bikinis so I didn\u2019t see why I made a difference.\n\nWe went to the beach and Rachel was a wreck all day, and refuse to come with us to the beach today, \n\nMy parents are now saying I\u2019m the AH for not just wearing a cover up that you can still swim in and that if I keep wearing swimwear it\u2019s going to ruin the trip.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit - re Adam and the body thing. Yes, you read it right. Rachel didn\u2019t elaborate but I presume Adam has made some kind of comments because several times during and after Rachel\u2019s pregnancy, he asked me about my postpartum diet/workout regimen. I was vague about it but did end up telling him I\u2019d had surgery and various non-invasive treatments and that diet/exercise was not the deciding factor.

Why are you asking if you're the asshole? You didn't have a baby and your sister is crazy. You should have sent her a long message blasting the hell out of her. She needs to tell you where she got the audacity from so that you can get some for yourself", "NTA", "LOL, NTA.\n\nI get about being insecure after having a baby. But you are on a *beach* vacation. You are correct that there will be many other females in a bikini. Why in the world is she singling you out??!!", "NTA. She doesn't get to police what you wear. And I agree, you are not the only woman in the beach, so why are you the one that has to cover up? If you want to keep the peace, maybe a compromise. You can wear a cover up when NOT swimming. But frankly, I wouldn't bother. Your body is not her business.", "NTA. Was she planning on taking a bunch of burlap sacks and tossing it all the women there wearing bikinis? I mean that's insane she just didn't want her husband looking at your body that hadn't just birthed a baby. If her husband is on her case for not being back to her pre-pregnancy body or looking fit and perfect after having a baby, then he is a totally major a****** . Your sister needs to get over herself. If she's so worried about her husband seeing you in the Bikini she's got bigger problems.", "Lol NTA. I mean I understand that she is not feeling comfortable in her skin after having a baby..but why would you hide your body because of that?", "NTA why didn\u2019t she stay home?", "NTA - I get feeling a bit insecure about your body after having a child. Your body changes and some lingering weight or stretch marks might make see youself in a less flattering light than you should. But your sister's insecurities are no reason for you to cover up. You did nothing wrong, no matter what others say.\n\nYour BIL, though! \"*she and Adam are not feeling the best about her postpartum body*\"?!?! He should build her up, not tear her down! And your parents? While they might be overprotective of their hurting daugther, they shouldn't focus their anger on you but on their son-in-law. And they should build up your sister's confidence. Maybe your husband and you can take a day for yourself and visit a different part of the beach with your daughter to have nice restful day?", "NTA and she didn't \"just\" have a baby if he's already a year old. I have 3 kids and I know it can take longer than that to get back to feeling comfortable in your own skin but this is a her problem not a you problem. The fact that her husband has a problem with her new body is more telling than anything else though.", "NTA\n\nAdam, on the other hand, would appear to be the greatest type of arsehole imaginable. Body shaming his SO who has just been through a physically traumatic experience to bring him a child and causing her the sort of insecurities that are eventually going to alienate everyone close to her. \n\nAlso your parents are kind of arseholes for trying to put this at your door instead of calling Adam out on his bs", "So basically you have a better body and she is worried her husband prefers you?", "NTA but try to help your sister with her insecurities.\n\nAlso to all the people commenting how \u201cAdam should be saying she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world because she carried his child\u201d are living in fantasy land, love and physical attraction are completely separate things, you could love someone to death and simply not be physically attracted to them anymore, this is something they need to work on together as a couple.\n\nWear your bikini and try to acknowledge your sister\u2019s feelings.", "NTA. Her husband's inability to accept his wife's postpartum body is not your fault--he is the AH.

My sister had 5 and can still wear a bikini. I never thought anything of it.", "Wait wait wait... her husband isn't comfortable with your sisters body after she had a baby? It's not even that she had a baby, what if she just gained 20lbs randomly... would her husband tell her he was uncomfortable with her body and she shouldn't wear a bikini? That's truly fucked up.", "NTA. Ive been the woman with a just had a baby body and the woman who had a few years to take care of my body. I absolutely HATE when women make other women feel bad for wearing the bikini, shorts, cute dress, etc. We have to give moms grace to get back to feeling like themselves after having a baby but we can\u2019t change our lives to accommodate others\u2019 feelings on bodies.", "The insecurities are on overload. I'd be concerned that her husband was attracted to me. NTA", "NTA. Her problems are not yours. She doesn't feel comfortable being around you in a bikini, you should turn it around and say you don't feel comfortable around her in a cover-up \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, it's a huge red flag that \"she and Adam are not feeling the best about her postpartum body.\" Wtf is wrong with Adam for not feeling \"the best\" about his wife's body AFTER GIVING BIRTH. Who is he to talk. \n\nI wonder if the issue is actually \"her postpartum body\" or if Adam is just a creep and she's caught him checking you out", "NTA. \n\nWhat your sister doesn't seem to realize is that you also have a postpartum body. And you have gotten yourself to the point where you can wear a bikini. Point that out, especially to your parents. Her and everyone else telling you to cover up constantly is actually Harmful to your own postpartum recovery. Why is your sister more important? \n\nIf anything, you are being a great role model to your sister. Something she needs to see.", "NTA.   Adam, however ITA.", "NTA. Wear whatever the hell YOU want, and your sister can wear whatever she wants. If her husband is side eyeing you in your bikini then he\u2019s a creep.", "Nta. Her insecurity is not your responsibility. No yeah you asked the right question: how come its not triggering for other women in bikinis, but it is when its you? Sounds a little bit controlling", ">My sister asked me not to wear a bikini or anything revealing because she said both she and Adam are not feeling the best about her postpartum body\n\nwhy is her husband not feeling the best about her body, she just had his baby and he don't feel good about her body. gross, i wonder if he was the one who put all these insecurities in her head.", "It's really sad both you sister & BIL can't embrace the beauty of a woman's body that just birthed a human.", "NTA \n\nYour sister needs a serious reality cyeck. Not her body, not her choices!\n\nAnd if BIL is giving her a hard time about her post partnum body, he needs a serious talking to as well.  SHE IS LOOKING THAT WAY BECAUSE YOU KNOCKED HER UP AND SHE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR MAKING AN ENTIRE NEW HUMAN: YOUR CHILD! YOU ABSOLUTE PLONKER!!!", "NTA.\n\nWe. Don\u2019t. Police. Women\u2019s. Bodies.\n\nFFS.", "NTA, Adam is. F that guy. A man disrespecting a woman's body after she gives him a child really sets off my temper.", "At least nobody will lose Adam at the beach with him waving that giant red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYeah, your sister just doesn't want her husband looking at your body and comparing to hers, wich from your edit ate the end, looks very accurate.", "NTA. What you do with your body and what you wear is your business. Her body is her business. Don't let her convince you otherwise.", "NTA. A good high-waisted bikini was my best friend during postpartum. It's not your fault that your sister is uncomfortable. Rock the swimwear!", "NTA, It\u2019s a tough one because you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong in this situation at all, however, post partum can wreck your general mental well being. Having empathy for your sisters \u2018irrational\u2019 request is probably the best course of action. \n\nEspecially because from what you\u2019re saying, the husband is only making it worse by airing a very hurtful and unfair opinion over her body. \n\nTry having a 1-1 with your sister and have an honest talk. I think she needs your support right now and asking you not to wear a bikini is the only way she can think to remedy her pain.", "NTA.  You are not obligated to wear something you don't want to wear just to pander to your sister's insecurities and her husband's immaturity.  What's next?  Will she ask you to gain weight so she doesn't look bad in comparison?  Should you not attend family events because her husband will compare your body to hers?  Fuck that.\n\nAnd for everyone saying you could \"be the bigger person\" or \"support your sister\" or \"keep the peace\" by wearing a cover up:  entitled people keep will keep doing what they do if everyone panders to them.  OP should not have to diminish herself because her sister has a problem.", "NTA - but it sure sounds like her husband is.", "NTA- her insecurities are HERS to deal with and she doesn't get to police your body because of them.", "NTA. Your sister needs help.", "NTA whatever it is her husband is saying to her about her body is clearly affecting her a great deal.\nEditing to add that his fixation on OP\u2019s body as well is very uncomfortable", "NTA", "NTA but your sister\u2019s husband is", "I don\u2019t feel like you are an AH, however, I do think you could have been a little more considerate right now especially if you know your sisters spouse is making rude comments about her body and comparing *you* to her. While I don\u2019t think that equates to you covering your body, instead of just wearing the bikini, you could have asked your sister to go shopping with you and told *her* to rock that bikini despite what her stupid husband is saying. I feel for her because I know I\u2019d probably feel pretty shitty too. She probably feels like nobody cares about her feelings. It\u2019s not your fault but you could have been supportive of your sister for sure.", "NTA. Her hubby is definitely. Your parents too. Idk when we got to the point that because someone felt X about themselves that meant that they had to make everyone else miserable as well. But it is pretty ridiculous.", "NTA. As you said, other women would be wearing bikinis. It's not fair of her to expect you to change things around because she feels self conscious.", "NTA. They need therapy! This is their problem and not yours and they have no right to make it a YOU problem. Do they want everyone to wear snow suits to the beach?", "NTA. Not your kitchen , not your dirty dishes. Enjoy your summer.", "NTA. Adam is the AH! Dude needs to lay off and love his wife for who she is, not who he wants her to be. This keeps up there may be a divorce in Rachel\u2019s future, Adam sounds toxic AF. If you\u2019re sister went through the trouble of asking you to cover up for her and adams sake, you know there have been discussions and maybe arguments over this behind closed doors.", "NTA\n\nI hate when people make their problems your problems because they're insecure. How dare you wear a swim suit to the beach? lmao", "NTA.  Your sister's husband probably is, though", "NTA, but if you want to avoid a whole other argument about it, maybe tell her you'll go off on Adam if he ever criticizes her body. Get a little crazy-eyes about it, and it might derail her projecting her struggles and marital issues onto you entirely.", "Adams the asshole.", "NTA. Her issues with her body are her own and her issues with her husband are her issues too", "NTA. Wow I'm disgusted by the part about HER HUSBAND expressing his displeasure w her postpartum body. I'm sorry it's gonna take me a minute to pick my jaw up off the floor. Idk why bc ik most people really suck, but thanks for the reminder of what a Saint my mom husband is, no matter what weight I've been or shape my body has been, as much as 60 lbs less and 60 lbs more than where I'm at now after 3 kids & 18 yrs married.\n\nIt's a beach. Others are going to be wearing more revealing things. If you're proud of & comfortable in your body then there's no reason for you or anyone else to wear a one piece just bc other ppl are uncomfortable. Their insecurities are their own, not yours. \n\nWith that being said I hope your sister gets the help & support she needs, & that her AH husband gets stricken with some condition or accident that makes him uncomfortable in his own skin outside of his control so he gets a taste of his own medicine.", "She\u2019s projecting her insecurities on you. And the husband sounds really shallow has well for being insecure about his wife\u2019s postpartum body when he should be encouraging her and building her self esteem. \n\n\nNTA. Go enjoy yourself!", "No you good. She is ridiculous", "At least you said \"kindly\" \nI never said she was fat,  nor did I say anything regarding her weight,  I just said she couldn't put down the carbs, stating fact, I've seen pregnant women that work out throughout their entire parasitic invasion(that's really what a pregnancy is) and look great after birthing a child, not shaming anyone,  and pushing a watermelon through a water hose will wreck anything! And I don't care what doctors say about it returning to normal,  that's a lie, it gets wrecked,  permanently changes are made to the body during pregnancy,  and it wrecks things on the way out!", "NTA", "Nta and it sounds like husband had made some very nasty comments about her body and possible made some about yours. Gross.", "NTA - she needs to get over her jealousy and insecurities", "Her husband doesn\u2019t feel good about her postpartum body?? I think I\u2019ve found the root of her insecurities", ">she said both she and Adam are not feeling the best about her postpartum body\n\nI had to re-read this a number of times and then said, \"WTF\".\n\nNTA. Call over to your sister someday when Adam is out and have a chat with her. Tell her she needs to tell her husband to get fucked and go see a therapist for herself to help build her own confidence.\n\nIf he makes comments about it, her best response is definitely, \"You're hardly an Adonis yourself dear, and you're definitely not packing enough meat to think you can be picky\".", "NTA  but your sister needs an urgent Adamectomy as soon as possible.", "NTA!", "NTA. Wtf, Adam is way out of line. How dare he \u201cfeel badly\u201d about his wife\u2019s body that grew, nourished, carried and birthed his son. If you\u2019re still on the vacation, is there a possibility that you, your mom, and Rachel could leave the kids with the men and take a \u2018just the girls!\u2019 trip over to the beach or somewhere else?", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why the sister feels under pressure in this scenario.

Her body is hers, not his.", "NTA, fuck me, I've not heard something so ridiculous as this in a while!", "NTA. She's making her insecurities your problem. I find it interesting with your parents are giving you a hard time but no one is saying anything to Adam about making comments on his wife's body after she just gave him a baby??  There's the AHs.", "NTA-\n\nIt\u2019s sounds like your sister is suffering from postpartum depression and should really get help. I can understand about feeling insecure about ones body after birth, but to demand other people to cover up is selfish.\nIt almost makes me wonder if she\u2019s jealous about not bouncing back after having a baby, it sucks but everyone\u2019s body handles pregnancy differently, but should be proud of herself and love herself more.\n\nThe husband not being comfortable around it is what really has me worried though. Why would he care who wears what? Is he perhaps upset with his wife\u2019s body after having a baby? If that\u2019s the case maybe it goes more than just swimwear and it was just an excuse to be mad or upset over what\u2019s really happening. Either way it sounds unhealthy as though he expected his wife to bounce back.", "NTA. But your family and Adam are. Who do they think they are to be wasting that energy on policing you instead of putting Adam in his place i.e. the sewer?", "Girl that is their problem you wear your bathing suit enjoy your vacation. Parents should be pissed off at their son-in-law who\u2019s an asshole to make their daughter feel like shit about her body after she just had a baby!!!!!!!!!!! Your sister needs to wake up and see her husband is toxic.  NTA", "NTA your BIL is and probably your parents for confronting you. Your sister is feeling insecure, but I don\u2019t think that means you need to cover up. I bet her asshole husband is making comments about your body and making her feel worse.

Does she really think you covering up will make her feel better about herself? That's the \"if you don't take the vaccine mine won't work\" mentality that's promoted victimhood and increased people believing their own problems are exclusively because of others. \n\nIs she going to ask you not to eat ice cream or make you workout so she loses weight too?", "The biggest AH IS YOUR SISTER'S HUSBAND!!! How dare he?! She just gave birth, is not feeling herself and instead of reassuring her and being positive, he is fueling the shit storm she is feeling. What an ass... Damn..", "NTA but Adam is a major asshole for making his wife feel so badly about her body that she felt the need to ask you not to wear a bikini.

Adam is a dick for making his wife feel like that. He should be telling her how beautiful she is because she just had his baby.

You could presume he was asking on her behalf to help her deal with her anxieties.", "NAH - she\u2019s allowed to be insecure and to ask you to be considerate of her struggles. She\u2019s just had a baby and is probably struggling with aesthetic changes to her body that understandably make her feel more vulnerable than normal. Unreasonable asks are somewhat to be expected of people in that position.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to respectfully decline - your body is none of her business and you don\u2019t owe her protection from feeling unpleasant emotions that have nothing to do with you.\n\nYour parents just want to support your sister and would prefer you graciously to set your justified objection to the request aside for her sake because she\u2019s in a really vulnerable state and you\u2019re not. They\u2019re not wrong for asking, nor are they assholes for being miffed that you continued to refuse. That\u2019s just them doing their best to be good parents when two of their kids have opposing interests at a time when one of them is much more sensitive than the other. Maybe misguided, but not malicious.\n\nI don\u2019t know how Adam has expressed his \u201cstruggles\u201d with his wife\u2019s body after she\u2019s given birth to his child, but if he told her he\u2019s not feeling attracted to her recently, that REALLY sucks and I kinda hate him for it - it would also explain a lot of how she\u2019s feeling.\n\nEither way, I don\u2019t have enough info about what Adam said or how he said it to say he\u2019s an AH for sure, because who knows what happened, how it was interpreted, if it was unprompted feedback or an honest response in a larger discussion (ex. \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we having sex more often, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d) so he\u2019s getting off on a technicality even though my impulse is that I want him to experience many paper cuts for his transgressions.", "NTA.

Sometimes it hurts and is a bit embarrassing, but in the end it helps a lot if it's supportive and meant well. I'm pretty sure your sister just got her own insecure perspective and her low-key insulting husband to lean on to. She needs a reality check about how her body is not some guys construction site. Please talk to her. Dig deep and try help her understand that.", "Nta. Her husband is king asshole.", "NTA, but I feel so sorry for your sister. She\u2019s probably starting to realize she just had a baby with a giant AH who has been awful to her and shown too much attention to her little sister\u2019s body and feels trapped in her marriage, on top of all the other normal struggles of postpartum life. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not a reasonable ask. You could consider wearing a less revealing bathing suit, out of empathy for your sister, but I don\u2019t even know that she would be satisfied with you in a one-piece.

To give your sister the most grace possible, the statement \"she and Adam are not feeling the best about her postpartum body and she really doesn\u2019t want to bring the topic up\" leads me to believe that she's afraid that her husband is going to see your bikini body, compare her to you, and give her a hard time. That's not your fault, that's not her fault, that's HIS fault. I probably just would have worn a more modest suit if it would make my sister feel better (though you have absolutely no obligation to do that and it DOES NOT make you an AH for wearing a bikini), but the real problem here is Adam. Maybe take this opportunity to check in with your sister about how he's treating her because damn, that man sounds like a jerk.
