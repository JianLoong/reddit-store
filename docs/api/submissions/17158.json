I have Asperger's Syndrome. I get relationships and social interactions wrong all the time. I'm actually asking because it's not obvious to me.**\n\n**My wife and my sister's fianc\u00e9 suggested press on nails. My sister said no because press on nails aren't long enough and because she wants all the wedding party to match her. My wife works Friday until after nail places are open. She starts wedding duties on Saturday before any open and there are no nail places near the golf course my sister is getting married at anyways. My wife doesn't have the ability to paint her nails herself so it looks good/professional. She needs a professional to do it. Also my sister only wants a French manicure on long nails and my wife's nails are as short as they can be. My wife can't have buffed nails because it still looks like nail polish.**\n\nMy sister's wedding is next Saturday. She asked my wife to be a bridesmaid. My sister has made an appointment Thursday morning for her and wedding party to have an appointment to get their nails done. Yesterday she told everyone that she wants their toes painted yellow to match their dresses, and fake nails with a something called a French manicure on their fingers.\n\nMy wife is a respiratory therapist and the hospital she works at forbids all its employees from wearing fake nails or nail polish, or even wearing their nails too long. There is no exception to this rule. My wife will not be allowed to work and her union couldn't do anything for her.\n\nMy sister told her she can have the fake nails removed the day after the wedding but that's still a problem. My wife is scheduled to work Thursday afternoon after the appointment as well as on Friday. She traded a shift with someone else to have Saturday off for the wedding but then she's working mornings from Sunday until Wednesday. If she gets the fake nails on Thursday morning, she won't be able to work on Thursday or Friday. She will also miss working on Sunday because her shift starts before any nail places open. My wife did research last night on the process for removing fake nails and there's absolutely no way she can do it herself without destroying her nails. My wife doesn't want to do that because she works with her hands.\n\nI'll point out there's never been any discussion or prior warning about the bridesmaids needing to have fake nails. My wife would have never agreed to it. My sister was originally going to go on her own and only decided to book an appointment for her wedding party less than two weeks ago. She only told her bridesmaids about it yesterday.\n\nI told my sister my wife can't do it and let's just say she wasn't happy. She accuses me of \"siding\" with her over my wife. Maybe I am doing that but I think my wife is right. My sister thinks my wife should just miss work or take days off. It's not that simple. My wife couldn't get time off on less than a weeks notice. That's not enough notice to use vacation time. She already had to trade shifts and work a double shift last month in order to have Saturday off. If she doesn't show up or gets sent home she won't get paid at all. \n\nMy wife can fight her own battles and I didn't get involved until my sister told my wife to lie about having coronavirus so she doesn't have to work. If my wife did this it would cause chaos at the hospital. Anyone she came into contact with, employees or patients, would have to go into quarantine if my wife was a \"verified\" case. And after three years of working with coronavirus patients my wife would never lie about something like that.\n\nAITA because I told my sister my wife is right and didn't deny that I'm siding with her?

Your sister is ridiculous. I\u2019m a licensed mail tech for 30 years. There is solid science behind your wife\u2019s job requirements against their anti nail enhancement policy. \n\nTo try to briefly sum it up in layman\u2019s terms, about 20 years ago there was an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit that was traced directly to a bacteria not uncommon to acrylic nails. A study ensued. What it found was that long, acrylic, (silk, gel, any overlay product including polish) was \u201cgermier\u201d than natural, and that with natural nails, the longer they were, the germier they were. This was true regardless of the hand washing/scrubbing involved. Long or enhanced still tested dirtier than short natural nails. So, short nails were mandated in hospitals.
