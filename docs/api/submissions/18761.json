She is cool and I (F25) like her as a friend, but I am wary around her since she doesn't want a boyfriend, and Mason is the boyfriend type, but none of my business. \n\nThe problem is, whenever I wake up, she is here. Whenever I sleep, she is here. Whenever I get back from work, she is here. I pointed this out to Mason, he said he would handle it. I told him, utilities are not included, if they come high I am not paying 50%. He said its ok. \n\nFast forward to today, first utility bill. Surprise! It is high. I asked the receptionist if she has seen this utility bill for 2 people, she says its more common for 3 or 4 people. \n\nI go upstairs and GUESS WHO IS THERE... NOT MASON. I tell Abby how the bill is high for 2 people and considering she has been here every day, we are splitting it 3 ways. She says no, she doesn't live here, to talk to Mason. \n\nAnd I explode. I tell her, \"You have been here every fucking morning, day, night. You are here more than Mason. You are freeloading and you are not even his girlfriend. Get the fuck out and don't come back unless you start paying rent. And take all your fucking clothes you have everywhere.\" \n\nMason later sits me down and talks about how inappropriate that was and he was going to pay for 75% of the bill from the start. I tell him, \"I pay rent. This is my apartment too. She is NOT living here for free, I don't care if you cover for her.\"\n\nHe says I am being unreasonable, that I am still paying whats fair. I say I don't care. AITA? \n\nTldr; roommates \"not\" girlfriend has been freeloading in our new apartment, utility bill came high, I demanded she pay her share, she refused, kicked her out. Roommate said he would cover for her, but I don't care, I do not want her living here for free.

Mason should've addressed this with you once it became apparent that she was basically going to be living there. You agreed to live with one person, another one hanging out there a significant amount of time changes the dynamic significantly. She needs to start paying rent, utilities, and food.", "NTA, it's pretty inconsiderate of your roommate to \"move\" someone else in without okaying it with you, the fact that she had clothes there is a real standout that she wasn't just visiting", "NTA\n\nYour rental agreement/lease agreement probably has something about guests they're violating, and you definitely didn't agree to take on another roommate.", "NTA. You said it perfectly, she's freeloading. If you're \"not the girlfriend type\" that's fine, but it doesn't give you a free pass to hang out all the time and act like you would expect in a relationship but without financially contributing because you're \"not his girlfriend\". Kick her out, and hopefully your friend catches on soon that she's using him.", "NTA and you were very tolerant for a long time, I would have throw her out after 2 or 3 days.", "NTA. Sure you probably could have been less abrasive, but I definitely get your frustration. I've been there, and it's annoying and entitled. Someone needed to let her know that isn't okay, and it wasn't going to be your roommate.", "NTA  \nYou moved in with one roommate, not two. He doesn't have the right to move a second roommate in regardless of how much he pays. Having said that, as long as she is there, you should demand he pays 2/3rds of the rent as well.", "She was very much living with you! Good for you for kicking her out\u2026 NTA", "NTA, constant presence of non-roommates is not ok, not even is she was his gf. You didn\u2019t agree to live with her, it\u2019s not that hard to understand, so Mason should stop playing dumb. Him paying most of the bills doesn\u2019t address her irritating constant presence", "NTA.  Then he starts paying  2/3 of the rent and everything if he wants her to stay, because that is the only way he can have her over as often as he does.", "NTA but also kind of the AH for how you talked to her and what you said. You could've been much nicer to her, and just talked to your roomate instead. But that being said he is being unreasonable and a little selfish by thinking its okay for this girl to be there 24/7 and freeload, so i get why you would be pissed.", "ESH. You and Mason needed to have a proper, grown up discussion weeks ago where expectations and boundaries were clearly laid out. WTF does \u201cI\u2019ll handle it\u201d even mean and how were you satisfied with that at the time? A third roommate is a big deal for more reasons than just utility bills, and you should get a say in how that dynamic is actually going to work. But after what, a month, of just letting your resentment simmer, instead of discussing it properly, it\u2019s no wonder you exploded at her when you got a high bill that I\u2019m assuming stressed you out a bit as well. You were right to have a problem with subsidising her stay, but you handled it very poorly. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late to have that discussion. You will need to apologise to the girl, but you could suggest that going forward all rent and bills (including this one) are split three ways, and request she pick up after herself better and pull her weight on the cleaning schedule.", "I'm gonna go with YTA.\n\nHonestly, Abby probably didn't know or didn't think about her being there 24/7 was going to be an issue. She probably assumed Mason had okayed it with you and that everything was kosher. If Mason is the one who continually has her there, you need to bring it up with Mason. She's not on the lease, so realistically there's nothing you can do to try and get money out of her.\n\nYour not TA for being upset about the situation and setting boundaries with Mason, but you are TA for yelling and swearing at her. That was uncalled for and unnecessary,", "YTA. There was no reason for you to kick her out over this. Not when Mason had already agreed to your demands of splitting utilities 3 ways.\n\nI understand your frustration of having her there all the time but you don\u2019t get to blow up in anger because they can\u2019t read your mind on it. Use your words and let them know your issue isn\u2019t just the high utility bill but the invasion of space too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
