Usually bread, eggs, milk and butter fell into this category. \n2. We had a schedule for who was next to buy TP and cleaning supplies. No cheap substitutes were allowed unless discussed before purchase. This worked out really well, as we were in college our mothers saw the list, and when visiting would stock us up. \n3. We set one day a week to clean the common areas, bathroom kitchen living room. It worked out well, as I preferred the bathroom, one roommate preferred the kitchen the other roommate did the dusting and vacuuming.\n4. Boyfriends could sleep over, but had to go home to shower and were not allowed to stay alone in the apartment unless we had a discussion about it first. We were located close to school so sometimes my roommates boyfriend would be there waiting for class. But again we knew about it before hand. And he was really respectful of our place and privacy. He had a car and would take us grocery shopping as payment or drive us to school/work. So win win. \n5. No strangers in the apartment. If we wanted to bring someone new home, we called ahead. If a roommate felt uncomfortable we didn\u2019t bring them home.\n6. Roommate bedrooms were off limits for guests. If I had to go in my roommates room, it was only to get something that was mine. If you needed to borrow something you had to ask, before entering the room by yourself. \n7. The only guests allowed for extended stays were family and friends who we all knew.
