He apologized, realized that she has been here all the time and didn't realize it would be suffocating for me. He is still going to pay for this month 75% utility and more rent. He told me he is now proactively helping Abby move out of her sister's house, who isn't great apparentally. \n\nHe said that Abby is still going to come around, but will only be here when he is around and max 3 days a week. \n\nThen he went quiet and I could tell he was waiting for an apology. Which I did lol. I appreciate the NTAs but I realized this is a ESH situation now. I apologized for the swearing, yelling and kicking her out. I informed him I will communicate very early on anything that is bothering me and will not let it simmer. We also discussed the food issue, Abby will not eat anything unless it is offered from now on. \n\nThen we called Abby and I apologized to her and she did me. Then we laughed bc I scared her to death and was honored bc that was the first time I blew up at anybody. We are getting drinks tomorrow... she is staying home today. \n\nHappy ending! Thanks everyone :) \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAround the same time we were in the process of moving in, lets call him Mason (M24) started hanging out with this girl, Abby (F23). She is cool and I (F25) like her as a friend, but I am wary around her since she doesn't want a boyfriend, and Mason is the boyfriend type, but none of my business. \n\nThe problem is, whenever I wake up, she is here. Whenever I sleep, she is here. Whenever I get back from work, she is here. I pointed this out to Mason, he said he would handle it. I told him, utilities are not included, if they come high I am not paying 50%. He said its ok. \n\nFast forward to today, first utility bill. Surprise! It is high. I asked the receptionist if she has seen this utility bill for 2 people, she says its more common for 3 or 4 people. \n\nI go upstairs and GUESS WHO IS THERE... NOT MASON. I tell Abby how the bill is high for 2 people and considering she has been here every day, we are splitting it 3 ways. She says no, she doesn't live here, to talk to Mason. \n\nAnd I explode. I tell her, \"You have been here every fucking morning, day, night. You are here more than Mason. You are freeloading and you are not even his girlfriend. Get the fuck out and don't come back unless you start paying rent. And take all your fucking clothes you have everywhere.\" \n\nMason later sits me down and talks about how inappropriate that was and he was going to pay for 75% of the bill from the start. I tell him, \"I pay rent. This is my apartment too. She is NOT living here for free, I don't care if you cover for her.\"\n\nHe says I am being unreasonable, that I am still paying whats fair. I say I don't care. AITA? \n\nTldr; roommates \"not\" girlfriend has been freeloading in our new apartment, utility bill came high, I demanded she pay her share, she refused, kicked her out. Roommate said he would cover for her, but I don't care, I do not want her living here for free. AITA?\n\nEdit: I want to clarify something. Mason and I are completely platonic. Friends for 8+ years, nothing has ever happened between us and there's no attraction there.

A third roommate is a big deal for more reasons than just utility bills, and you should get a say in how that dynamic is actually going to work. But after what, a month, of just letting your resentment simmer, instead of discussing it properly, it\u2019s no wonder you exploded at her when you got a high bill that I\u2019m assuming stressed you out a bit as well. You were right to have a problem with subsidising her stay, but you handled it very poorly. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late to have that discussion.

Usually bread, eggs, milk and butter fell into this category. \n2. We had a schedule for who was next to buy TP and cleaning supplies. No cheap substitutes were allowed unless discussed before purchase. This worked out really well, as we were in college our mothers saw the list, and when visiting would stock us up. \n3. We set one day a week to clean the common areas, bathroom kitchen living room.

If my roommate made the decision to move someone into our shared space without letting me know or discussing if it\u2019s even remotely okay I\u2019d be pissed too. OP has every right to be upset at this moocher who eats her food and bums around her place. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to understand think of this. \nYou don\u2019t have any pets and live with your roommate but one day you come home and there\u2019s a new dog your roommate brought in. You\u2019re okay with dogs as you think maybe your roommates pet sitting and it\u2019s temporary. But then you come to find out that the dog is permeant and he never told you. It\u2019s upsetting that you didn\u2019t get to have a say in your environment changing right? You\u2019d want to be let know or at least asked \u201chey is it okay if I adopt a dog\u201d? Right?", "If she\u2019s constantly there, it will absolutely bump up the bills quite a lot!", "I think Abby saying, \"I don't live here\" was the last straw", "Oh nah get her ass out. My roommate had the same thing going on, except this girl literally cleaned, cooked (even for me sometimes), did laundry and everything in between. Also very respectful and would even get food for the place. It was great", "Right and I understand that. but they acted with a lot of temper and maybe a civil conversation would have been better. Maybe set some parameters for when she comes over?", "NP, Mason seems like a shitty roommate. Even if he addresses this instance, I don\u2019t get the impression that he really cares about your happiness at home. You deserve to be able to relax at home, we all do. If he doesn\u2019t get that, then he\u2019s just the worst. If happiness/calm at home means something different to each of you then you might just be better as friends rather than also living together.", "Right? We should be able to choose our roommates and OP did not choose to live with Abby.", "You were way to nice.  You shoulda just sat there and stared back, make them uncomfortable.  You need in the kitchen, just go in there and cook, with lots of elbow bumping\u2026 whoops, so sorry, lol.", "Realistically, it DOES god damn matter! OP has not signed up to live with the freeloader! OP is well within their right to kick someone out of their home. Mason should not be there when the roommate also isn\u2019t there.", "Moving in a person into your home against the wishes of the other people who live there DOES actually matter.", "My flatmates girlfriend was single handedly responsible for 60% of our power bill so trust me one person can do a lot", "The only way you could think this is if you've never had to pay for utilities.     \nEvery body you add to a home increases the bills.", "Thank you for the unexpected laugh. Needed that.", "Gonna go with NTA. Girl sounds like a leech who found herself a nice blood supply in your roommate. Hope she took the hint (but probably didn't)", "Are you the hobosexual in question, Abby?", "Hey OP, I think you just edit your post (the three dots?) And add the edit either at the beginning or at the end with \"EDIT:\".\nUp to you how you wonna do that! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0b", "Oh one more thing OP, what did you mean in your OP by \"I was wary of her, because she didn't want to have a bf...\" \nWhat do you mean by that? \nI legit got confused it was two GUYS living together, and that they both kinda fancied her? But you (I thought M) decided not to do anything coz she wasn't looking for a bf?? \n\nHow does it all work now????", "Right. If Abby was a roommate (on the lease and paying rent and utilities or having the same paid on her behalf) all of that would be acceptable save for that last one. OP has the right to say she doesn't want an additional roommate or doesn't want Abby as a roommate, but if OP's saying that she doesn't want Abby as a roommate if Abby herself isn't paying (even if her share were being covered), it colors things differently to me. It makes it look like the concern is more to protect Mason in this case. If OP wouldn't want Abby as a roommate if Abby 's parents were paying, it might suggest something else.\n\nYou might be right, but I just read things differently from OP's post.", "What a plot twist but no", "I will do that after I have an update then", "Because she does not want to commit to Mason but has no problem using his apartment, meanwhile Mason wants to commit to her but hasn't asked bc he knows she doesn't want commitment. I told her to tell her anyway, bc there's nothing stopping her from meeting other people, but he hasn't. She told me her friends thought they were bf/gf, but she says they are just fwb. Just protectiveness I guess.", "I interpreted that as OP just looking out for her friend. She\u2019s been friends with Mason for 8 years and probably doesn\u2019t want him to get taken advantage of or be led on, hence being \u201cwary\u201d of Abby as it seems to me that Mason is more into the relationship than she is", "Agree. I would do EVERYTHING zhe same i would usually do when he wasn't around. And i wiuld friggin open all the blinds in thr morning, walk in in my pajamas, and go to thr kitchen to make me breakfast. And honestly, i would also tell the roommate from the start that i dont feel LIVING with this stranger, first bcs you don't know him very well, second bcs he is a dude! I wiuld never decide to share living with the opposite sex. Its uncomfortable and on efeels way too self-conscious all the time.", "I\u2019m an introvert, and my roommate/best friend of 10 years is extroverted. He doesn\u2019t care if I bring someone over. \n\n\nHowever, HE never brings anyone over. He just really likes his space in a relationship. It\u2019s HIS space - he doesn\u2019t mind sharing it with roommates or friends, but he has a strict boundary with partners. I ask everytime I want to bring a friend or boyfriend over, but I don\u2019t even bother to ask if he\u2019ll bring his boyfriend over anymore. He usually doesn\u2019t bring friends over, either. If he wants me to meet one of his friends, he\u2019ll get us out to dinner or something.", "See I like this better. Glass half full! Wholesome.", "Landlords usually aren't ok with another person basically living there without their knowledge either. It can cause a whole lot of problems.   \n\n\nStaying over every now and then is fine, but being there all the time? Girl, go home.  \nNTA.", "AND if she doesn't chip in for utilities, Mason should pay the extra.\nAnd what does the landlord think of an extra occupant? Hmmm. NTA, OP.", "This is such an important point too. OP should take a magnifying glass to the lease agreement and make sure Mason and his thing aren't going to get them kicked out.", "Did the same with my man. I paid a third rent and chipped in for utilities.", " Don't talk BS like\n\n>  but none of my business\n\nand then be like ... actually I don't want her to hang around you here. And scream that crap to \"her friend\". And make demands like: No Mason! Don't cover for her! It must be her who is paying!  \n\nJust read her comments, she is absolutely making it her business.", "You should have talked out the room and board thing with both of them prior to yelling. And also brought up the fact that this girl is eating your food. \n\nFinally, her telling you that she's not looking for a bf has nothing to do with you or the root problem in your post. They could be a thing without putting a strict label on it, she might not want to talk to you about it for any number of reasons. But you harping on this fine point that they're not defined or official is not really relevant to the post.  Even if they were dating, the girl living there rent free would be a problem. \n\nI think your over emphasis on what they're not, is just another way to make the girl seem like an AH. Don't get me wrong, she is an AH. But not because she doesn't want a significant other and your roommate does.", "bro I'm right there with you, lmao, what a revelation.", "If op isn\u2019t paying her expenses then no, it doesn\u2019t. Because she\u2019s not freeloading off op. She\u2019s freeloading off the other dude. You can get assholish and cuss at me all you want. I simply have a different perspective on it.", "I have a feeling AAA would be sad about that.", "lies, that's never happened it's always time to make the donuts", "Wow, don't know how you thought op didn't know this.", "Well, she takes every benefit a FWB can offer it seems\ud83d\ude05 a living space, food and water, and if he had, she would take his money too.", "I read this as \"Panty Raiding\" \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02"]}
