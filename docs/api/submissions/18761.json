Usually bread, eggs, milk and butter fell into this category. \n2. We had a schedule for who was next to buy TP and cleaning supplies. No cheap substitutes were allowed unless discussed before purchase. This worked out really well, as we were in college our mothers saw the list, and when visiting would stock us up. \n3. We set one day a week to clean the common areas, bathroom kitchen living room. It worked out well, as I preferred the bathroom, one roommate preferred the kitchen the other roommate did the dusting and vacuuming.\n4. Boyfriends could sleep over, but had to go home to shower and were not allowed to stay alone in the apartment unless we had a discussion about it first. We were located close to school so sometimes my roommates boyfriend would be there waiting for class. But again we knew about it before hand. And he was really respectful of our place and privacy. He had a car and would take us grocery shopping as payment or drive us to school/work. So win win. \n5. No strangers in the apartment. If we wanted to bring someone new home, we called ahead. If a roommate felt uncomfortable we didn\u2019t bring them home.\n6. Roommate bedrooms were off limits for guests. If I had to go in my roommates room, it was only to get something that was mine. If you needed to borrow something you had to ask, before entering the room by yourself. \n7. The only guests allowed for extended stays were family and friends who we all knew.

Ofc she eats your food, nobody says nothing to her. Take a look in the glass OP, people steal your food and you come to reddit to know if you're TA.

It's not hard.  It doesn't matter if she's there all the time, you can knock on the door or poke your head into the room and say \"Mason, have you got ten minutes? I need to talk to you about something important.\"\n\nSimple.", "Ehh, I'll take the downvotes if they keep coming.  I think in telling Mason that he isn't paying 50%, I would assume OP meant that he's expecting Mason to cover her share.  Abby was a bit blindsided and probably just defensive, but it doesn't make her not an AH in the first place either.  It just seems like ... everyone sucks here.

I'm an anxious, introverted person usually and I used to not like it when my friend had a girl over 24/7 just because I felt like I couldn't just be myself at my own house without some stranger (to me) there all the time. I didn't mind either of my roommates having people over because we all had people over sometimes, it was just that he would have her over even when he wasn't home and sometimes I just wanted to be alone in my own house. In my case though after I asked him to stop letting her stay while he wasn't there he ended up just moving out and in with her lmao. She ended up cheating on him just a week after he moved in with her, but in her mind it wasn't a problem because the whole half a year she stayed at our place they were \"just friends\".", "I'm not disagreeing with your second point, absolutely, I'm saying that exploding at people isn't a good way to get what you want.  If Mason's not there, *wait for him to be there* and then have an adult conversation, explain the numbers etc:   I'm not defending the freeloader at all, I'm saying that there are better and more effective ways to get what you want aside from angrily and reactively exploding at people, which in my experience, is the *least* effective way to get a positive resolution from any situation.", "You got me on a technicality there haha.  I should clarify that the conversation that she is overstaying her welcome should have happened well before approaching her with a bill in hand, asking her to cover some of it, and then unloading on her.
