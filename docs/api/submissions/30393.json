My wife agrees with and supports this decision. \n\nMy wife and her family are the opposite of mine. Her mom and dad have been married for several decades.

She makes these plans with her parents and sisters for all holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving and I am very rarely included in the planning process. \n\nAbout a year ago I spoke with my wife about this. I told her I do not appreciate her planning holidays without giving me the opportunity to be a part of the planning. I also told her I do not want to spend every holiday with her parents and sisters.

Seeing family is fine, but that can also inhibit the development of your own family holiday traditions.\n\n In my family of origin it was expected that Thanksgiving & Christmas belonged to my parents. The result of a lifetime of this routine,\"family holiday traditions\" skipped a generation; my nuclear family never really established any of our own traditions. When my kids had their own families, they established their own holiday traditions in their own homes. Itinerant guesting is not a great holiday tradition, in my opinion. \n\nI hope you can sit down with your wife and discuss your desire to build holidays with your family, to share holiday meals and activities to look forward to with each other and create some happiness around your own hearth.", "NTA and she's forgetting that this is a marriage of two people. She acts like you are just supposed to tag along with whatever she decides. That's not a partnership. \n\nMaybe sit out of a few of the planned holidays. \n\nShe plans to summer with the family? Then you book a vacation solo without her while she goes.", "NTA. It's a very reasonable request. She is ignoring/disregarding your feelings.", "NTA.  I can understand your wife wanting to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with her family, especially if her sisters and their families are there as well. Having said that, I wouldn't be willing to spend summer holidays with them too-that's a bridge too far and you're entitled to spend time with your family and only your family.\n\nSit down with your wife and talk it through. Plan a summer holiday together. If you're not happy doing both Thanksgiving AND Christmas with her family, explain that and come to an agreement, whether that's the same one every year, or alternate one year Thanksgiving, the other Christmas. Communication and compromise, from both of you,  is key here.", "NTA. She is being overbearing and selfish to expect to get her way all the time. You matter too and she should not need to be convinced of that.", "NTA There is nothing better and more relaxing than a low key holiday with your family at home.", "NTA\n\nI don't quite understand how your wife \"does not agree\".  How does one agree or disagree with a fact, such as the fact that you do not want to spend all your holidays and vacations with her family.  \n\nTell her that if she keeps pushing, you'll make separate arrangements for you and the kids for a year that have nothing to do with her family just to balance out the extreme family time she has forced on you.  Then do it.\n\nI'd also point out that from now on, and following her lead, you can say \"I don't agree\" and do whatever you want every time she wants something.  I imagine if that happened, she'd remember that marriage doesn't work like that.", "NTA.\n\nYou should get equal input into planning holidays and vacations, regardless of your relationship with your parents. In my mind, a good starting point would be 1/3 her parents, 1/3 your parents, and 1/3 just you and your kids.  With your parents out of the picture, she could argue her parents get 2/3 but you still need time with just your family.\n\n\"Spending time with\" her or your extended family can mean a lot of different things.  If you all live close, there's no reason you can't spend a few hours with each family.  For Christmas in particular, you should be spending Christmas morning in your pajamas with your kids opening presents at their own house.  Likewise Thanksgiving is just the Thursday--no reason to spend 4 days with her family.\n\nHopefully you aren't spending the kids' entire break at the in-law's house, and you guys occasionally vacation alone, right?", "NTA.  What you are asking is quite reasonable.  It is quite reasonable when 2 people create their own family unit that they also create their own traditions around the hoildays.  What you offered was a great compromise.  You, your wife and kids are a family and should be the priority for the holidays - not any extended family.", "~~INFO:~~ Are you \"local\" to her family? If so then are you actually objecting to just going over for the day to eat, open presents, etc.?\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I don't get how your wife doesn't see what she's doing is just downright annoying? Imagine the tables were turned and you made every holiday plan with your family, I'm sure she'd be real sick of it too. I'd just stay back by yourself if she doesn't play nice. Shame on her.", "NTA\n\nI think this is more about wanting to spend more time with just the nucular family, your wife and kids, on special occassions than with the extended family; Grands, cousins, aunts and uncles. \n\nMy dad's side of the family lived a bit far from us growing up. We would see them maybe twice a year. Where as my mom's side lived just across the street so we did spend more time around them in general. We went to church with them, they would watch us after school, we went on vacations together. Etc. Etc. But we also would do things just us, siblings and parents. We would also visit my dad's family it just wasn't usually on the date of the holliday. \n\nAs I got older I wanted to spend less time with the whole extended family at once. Big family gatherings can be exhausting. So as we got older we wouldn't spend all day at my grandmas house we would just spend a couple hours then go home. \n\nIdk how far you live from your inlaws but there is nothing wrong with wanting to spend vacations and holidays with just the nucular family.", "NTA. If she won't compromise then put your foot down and insist on planning the summer holiday, then do what you for you and your family.", "NTA.\n\nMarriage is a team sport.", "NTA; she\u2019s ignoring your needs and is being unfair here.", "If your wife was going to bend, you would have been included in the planning this year. NTA", "NTA- do Thanksgiving with her family and Christmases on your own. That eliminates the extravagant gift situation and allows you to develop traditions that are just your nuclear family. If she has to do Christmas, embrace the British tradition of Boxing Say where  you visit for a few hours the day after Christmas.", "10 years and kids means you totally get to celebrate Christmas and vacations without inlaws.\n\nIt's a massive overstep for your wife to make these plans and insist on your compliance. Good marriages involve communication and compromise and I am not reading about any of that in your account.\n\nNTA", "NTA,OP. I have nothing to add but my support. I'm in the same position as you, very LC with my parents, so no holidays with them for the past 10 years. It's expected by my husband that instead of doing Thanksgiving and / or Xmas just \"us\" (we are child free) or with friends, we have to spend these holidays with his family (very local to us so thankfully we don't have to spend more than a few hours at a time). He is very close to them.I do not enjoy spending time with them at all. I actually dread the holidays and hate Thanksgiving and Xmas now, I honestly miss the toxic dysfunction of my past family holidays, which says a lot. I draw a hard NO at spending NYE with them, and luckily, no forced vacations. OP, I wish you the best of luck in working out a compromise with your wife.", "I\u2019m inclined to say N A H but it\u2019s because I think holidays should be spent with the whole family and I would feel awkward telling my parents we are going to be spending a holiday just my husband and I.  That said NTA because your request is reasonable and completely disregarding your feelings isn\u2019t something a loving partner does.", "NTA. She is forcing you into something you don't agree with. Resist.", "NTA\n\nI'd want the same thing as you, even if you weren't NC with your family.  Gotta have quality and separate time!", "Well now *I* feel like a complete asshole. My husband is very very very low contact with his parents and I am no contact with them so we spend zero holidays/vacations with them. I plan all the holidays and vacations with *my* family without my husband's input. He loves my family and it never occurred to me to do anything different until reading this post. I'm going to go apologize to my husband now..", "NAH . Holidays are traditionally with family, and you haven't spoken up before about it. \n\nIf she wants to be with family, let her tho and let the kids decide what they want to do as well. During covid I had smaller holidays (by myself or just my mom) and I hated it and it didn't feel like a holiday.\n\nI've also had family members sit out of holidays and didn't hold it against them, unless it was every holiday.", "Yta- I really don't think it's unreasonable to spend the holidays with extended family. If she was pushing spending time with her family to the neglect of yours then that's an issue, but since you don't have a relationship with your extended family that's not an issue at play here. Not to mention that for big holidays like Christmas it's not unusual to spend times with both sides of the family anyways so even if you were in contact with your family you'd still probably be spending some Christmas time with her family anyways.Just cause you don't talk to your family doesn't mean you get to call dibs on half the holidays.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Once my husband and I had kids we started having holidays for us with our children", "NTA. Yes they are family but in laws are considered secondary family.

She's only an asshole because she's not including you in the  the planning process. Focus on that as a non-negotiable in the issue.\n\nIf your in-laws are local-ish then I don't think it's likely your wife is going to be OK with rotating holidays between \"with them\" and \"with you and the kids.\" You might do better to shoot for limited time or a day *around* the actual holiday.", "I agree!\n\nTBH - Thanksgiving is everyone, Christmas is nuclear family - you can do XMas eve or Boxing Day (26th) with the in-laws or whatever works best.", "Can\u2019t you compromise? My dad\u2019s family isn\u2019t big on holidays so we only saw my mom\u2019s family on holidays. When I was growing up, my parents divided the day in half. The first part of the day was just our immediate family and the latter half was spent with our extended family. We still spent every holiday with my mom\u2019s family. It just wasn\u2019t the whole day. My sister and I will probably handle things a similar way when we start families of our own. \n\nIf you want to be included in the planning process, take the initiative and involve yourself. The holidays come at the same time every year so sometime between 10/1 and 10/20, you should start talking to your wife about what you envision for the holidays that year. You should also have suggestions in mind for what you and your family can do together. Simply saying that you don\u2019t what to spend the holidays with her family won\u2019t get you anywhere. You need to have actual ideas that you both can build on. I\u2019m not criticizing the way you\u2019ve been handling things so far.

That way he and I will have Xmas Eve and Xmas Day alone together. I'm surprisingly ok with this.

I also swore that I would never again accidentally invite my entire family on our anniversary trips - in my defense, that one actually was accidental but it was only a month ago so he's still a bit salty about it..\n\nAll in all it was a productive conversation. He expects that I'll probably forget occasionally, but, instead of him just going along to get along he'll be honest if it's something he doesn't want to do.\n\nNow I just need to break the news to my mother - who loves him so much she tells everyone she's \"keeping him in the event of divorce\" and unabashedly reminds everyone that \"he's my favorite child\" at every opportunity lol", "I can get the vacation thing but just skipping spending holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas with your extended family is crazy.

Especially since most families I know manage to get Christmas time with both sides of the family each year and spend immediate family Christmas time as well. There is. Absolutely no way OP's family is spending 100% of the Christmas season at the wife's family's.

Christmas is immediate family. I think it is crazy how families will open presents in the morning and then go to one set of grandparents for lunch then the other for dinner if they\u2019re all local. It is insanity. Let the kids spend the day at home with their gifts. Grandparents/extended family Christmas is during the surrounding weekends or the days around Christmas like you said. Make traditions and memeories with your immediate family for Christmas.", "Sounds like you had a very productive conversation.  Good on you for taking the initiative to start a difficult conversation and being willing to compromise.", "I didn\u2019t say it would be awkward, just not as fun.  Holidays to me are about bringing a lot of people together, seeing everyone and catching up, meeting the newest members of the family, whether they are babies or dates, and making tons of fancier than usual food. You simply don\u2019t get that experience hanging around with one or two people.  It doesn\u2019t mean that a different way is wrong, but I certainly would not be happy about it.", "i dunno i have very fond memories of the big Christmas dinner with my whole extended family. we always did morning family only, dinner with either close friends or extended.", "i dunno. i have very fond memories of going nowhere and playing with toys on Christmas."]}
