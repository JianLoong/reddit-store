We're both only children so no siblings between the two of us. Both of our fathers also don't have siblings. You might see where I'm going with this. Both of our family names end with us so it was discussion when we decided to get married about what to do with our last name.

Ultimately, we decided to keep our maiden names as we're both not a fan of hyphenated names.\n\nI guess the more important thing is what we were going to do about our kids. My wife has a simple but cool sounding last name while I have a more ethnic sounding last name. When we had our son, we decided to give him my wife's last name. It was a mutual decision. I didn't really want a V on my side of the family so no harm, no foul. The issue is, now we're getting ready to welcome our second child, a daughter, and my wife wants to give her my last name. \n\nI think it's sweet what she's doing but I don't really like the idea of our kids growing up with multiple last names. It sounds weird to me for a normal family dynamic. I've tried telling her that it's ok and that we can just keep using her last name but she refuses to budge. I'm not sure why she's so hellbent on it because there doesn't really seem to be any push from my side of the family. \n\nIs it just me that thinks it would be a weird thing in the US?

Some bitchy doctors have asked women to prove they are the mother. People assume my coworker is a nanny or aunt or grandma because she doesn't have the same last name as her 6 year old. \n\nStrangers, teachers, friends,  etc. will assume the kids are step siblings or half siblings. This can confuse your kids if people start asking stupid questions trying to figure out \"how they're related\". \n\nYour kids might feel like the different last names are proof you and your wife picked a favorite child, etc. \n\nIt is honestly best to have their names the same. \n\nI would suggest changing your last name to your wife's so you have a family name, but at the least keep the kids the same.
