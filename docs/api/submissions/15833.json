My wife has a simple but cool sounding last name while I have a more ethnic sounding last name. When we had our son, we decided to give him my wife's last name. It was a mutual decision. I didn't really want a V on my side of the family so no harm, no foul. The issue is, now we're getting ready to welcome our second child, a daughter, and my wife wants to give her my last name. \n\nI think it's sweet what she's doing but I don't really like the idea of our kids growing up with multiple last names. It sounds weird to me for a normal family dynamic. I've tried telling her that it's ok and that we can just keep using her last name but she refuses to budge. I'm not sure why she's so hellbent on it because there doesn't really seem to be any push from my side of the family. \n\nIs it just me that thinks it would be a weird thing in the US?

Something you may not have thought of as only children- it's SUPER common for similarly aged siblings to share teachers, and unless the oldest is the most boring kid on earth whatever reputation they have carries over. My middle brother got teachers expecting him to be an A student because I was, our youngest brother got that AND our middle brother's reputation for student gov and being an artist, and heaven help the kids with older siblings who were notorious trouble makers. Different last names keeps that from happening. On the other hand, it could introduce problems- I don't know who does most of the school stuff for your kids, but having a different surname to your child can cause problems with some, and I don't know how that would interact with siblings.", "\"Twins?? And you're both named 'Brad'??\"  \n  \n\"We have different last names.\"", "Wait\u2026 what\u2019s the other question?", "Just tell people you're named after Lee Harvey Oswald.", "NAH. I have an aunt and uncle with two kids, one with her last name and one with his. I grew up in a blended family where there were three surnames shared by six people. It's fine! People will occasionally be weird about how they can't refer to your entire family with a single name (like \"the Smiths\"), but whatever.", "NAH, I knew a family growing up that alternated children with the parents last names. They were still all siblings and family, it didn\u2019t matter!", "NTA, I don't understand her insistence on this. If the 2nd child has her name they will share a surname and life will be easier.", "Just pick something totally random you both like. Why not. Or, give them both your last names. This just seems so crazy to me. But hey, your kids, your names.", "I know someone who did something similar, and it was really confusing for their kids. I would recommend against it.", "Agreed, not weird at all, I know a couple who did this because the wife had a PhD and wouldn't change her professional name - her last name also sounded cooler and was oddly relevant to her husband's profession. Do it!\n\nNTA", "Having to constantly spell the name.\n\nHaving people mispronounce it.\n\nHaving fewer job opportunities - unfortunately, studies show that people with \"regular American names\" are much more likely to get calls for interviews as compared to those with \"ethnic\" names.\n\nMy guess is that OP has experienced all of this and would prefer an easier life experience for his kids.", "..wth..\n\nETA: WOW! Iceland has some truly crazy laws around names! How does this work for immigrants naming children?!", "Covid basically robbed my \"Giving a shit about what other people think\" savings account.\n\nIn this case I think the Wife is trying to do what she feels is right. And continuing both of the last names is admirable.", "And pronounce, that's also a big one. While I have a very simple last name, like in if you can speak English at the level of a 3 year old, you can pronounce my name kind of simple, I've had a lot of friends who weren't in the same boat.\n\nThere was this one kid I was kind of friendly with in middle school, his surname was Nguyen. There wasn't a teacher in the entire school who got his name right on the first try. I felt bad for him, and I made the effort to learn, from him, how to pronounce it.\n\n Granted, part of the trouble on the side of our teachers was the fact that the proper pronunciation of his surname uses sounds that aren't really used in English, but a lot of them didn't even try. One teacher called him Glenn the entire year. Another teacher thought he was related to Teddy Nugent, and that admin had a stroke or something when they typed his name in.", "My mind is blown away. Even the laws around first names.", "Yes! I\u2019m parenting in a blended family, and for our 3rd, since the older two have different last names anyway, my partner and I gave the baby a combination of the Grandmother\u2019s names, since those were the only names that didn\u2019t get passed down in the family. Also, this way all three kids have different names, rather than two the same and one different.", "I can brush up on my French, but yes. Maybe he should just say surname. It was just odd. Why change surnames of your children for both of your children.", "Go be the white saviour somewhere else, or better yet nowhere", "Not quite sure what your mean, but I have friends where they chose to change both their names to her mother's maiden name because the husband had brothers but the wife's mother's name was set to be lost forever in their family tree.", "Go off into a forest and never come back, I promise no one will miss you. Or even notice you're gone.", "What a hero you are for policing how non white people should feel about their own life experiences with your ignorant ass puritan nonsense. Go give yourself a big pat on the back for having the highest horse.", "Oh god 'puritan' never mind we got a braindead tiktok user type who thinks anyone with an opinion more than never attempt to change anything ever because it's hard is some kind of psyop.", "INFO\n\n> I am a IV so I didn't really want to change my name for that reason\n\n> I didn't really want a V on my side of the family so no harm, no foul.\n\nI do not understand your feelings about your surname.\n\nYou love it so much you won't change it for risk of losing your IV? \n\nBut you see **utterly _no_ value** in letting your child have the same thing?", "I had friends who did this, it isn't that big of a deal.", "Use both. Alphabetical order.", "This was my thought! \n\nIf OP has last name X, and wife + first kid have last name Y, they\u2019re already a family with multiple last names?", "Ehh, actually, I guarantee that is NOT the worst case scenario", "So since they are in the US, it\u2019s valid to bring up racism.\n\nIf OP\u2019s last name is ethnic sounding, the daughter may suffer more discrimination than the son because of it.\n\nThere have been multiple studies about it in regards to application screening.\n\nThough one can hope that in 18 years, we are in a better spot than today.", "When you plan for your child's future you should generally avoid giving them bully fodder. Sure *you* shouldn't care what others think, but that's generally a lesson learned with age and a child won't have the advantage of time on their side.", "Yes, but why would daughter be a V unless OP was giving the exact same name. If is Tom M Harrison IV the daughter would not be Rian Harrison V.", "I don't think you're a psyop, I just think you're privileged and don't understand real adversity, so something like this actually offends you. I bet your surname is 'Smith' or something so how are you gonna tell someone whose surname is 'Rajneshpuram' or whatever how they should feel about the way that affects them?"]}
