I came into our marriage with two kids. Noah (15m) and Eliza (13f). My ex and I broke up when I was pregnant with Eliza.\n\nI met Andrew a little over a year later and we dated for several months before he met the kids. My ex did not like the fact that I had moved on. I was up front with Andrew about how things were with my ex and that he might not like us dating before we reached the stage where my ex found out. He said it didn't matter and he really liked me and we'd make it work.\n\nMy ex started the alienation early. Despite my best efforts the kids believed and still believe what my ex has told them. We always split custody 50/50. It was difficult when the kids were smaller. They were always dismissing Andrew and telling him he wasn't their dad, they would tell us what their dad said about him and would say their dad wouldn't lie when I would correct it. They believed I didn't see it because I loved Andrew. It was things like Andrew made them breakfast so they'd love him more than their dad, or that he showed up to things for them because he wanted to make their dad angry, or that he wanted to steal us away from him.\n\nWe were in and out of court. We had individual and family therapy going for us and the kids. The ultimate goal was for the kids not to be used as pawns and for a more civil home life. It was also to give me the tools to do the right thing when my kids were being rude or disrespectful toward Andrew. My ex never lost any custody over the things he was saying. He was told to stop. But saying that time after time and doing nothing else changed nothing.\n\nA few years ago we reached a point of civility. Noah and Eliza do not love or respect Andrew really.

But the next time we saw them they started to use that language and I interrupted them before they could make things worse, because the kids were already mad hearing it.

These are facts, with definitions and everything.  First, you need to find a better therapist for your kids and your husband.  \n\nAnother fact, your ex is a monster and a puppet master who continues to control you, your husband and your shared kids, and your other kids. Now he's trying to extend his reach to your parents - and your letting him.   STOP LETTING HIM PULL THE STRINGS.  Take all that misplaced anger you've dumped on your parents and put it where it belongs - your ex. \n\nYour ex is a right off.  That means YOU and your husband are the only ones left to role model what a healthy marriage looks like, what healthy relationships look like, what healthy parents and step parents look like.  You are teaching them how to be future husbands / wives to their partners.  You are teaching them how to parents to their future kids and step kids.  Would you really wish this situation on their future partners or kids? You need to end this abuse now, or the cycle will continue with your kids. \n\nGet a new therapist for yourself and husband.  A new one for your kids.  Is it going to be easy, no.  It's going to be a nightmare, which is why you need a legit therapist to make a plan, including facilitating the session when you introduce new family expectations, boundaries, consequences and re -normalizing basic f'ing terms and roles.  \n\nAccept it will be hell.  But its short term pain for long term gain.  You may not think that due to the last 10 years, but you've got another 40 years of this garbage if you don't get this under control.  \n\nDo not communicate with your ex unless its via email.  No more coparenting, you can't with this type of person.  You parallel parent. Your new therapist can help navigate this.  Your kids WILL see your ex for what he is.  Not for awhile, maybe not until their adults but they will see, and when they do - your ex will lose.  Your house needs to be the stable home, the haven, where they aren't grilled about your ex, or made to feel guilty to loving both their parents, because its normal to love both parents.  Ask them nothing about their ex, if they offer - cool beans.  No kid wants to live in a war zone or a constantly on edge.  Eventually, they will gravitate to the place where their words and actions can't be weaponized against them. \n\n Take it from someone whose walked in your shoes and apologize to your parents...and your husband.", "As long as you and Andrew have a separate account where nothing he earns get spent on the kids who have made it clear they want nothing to do with him NTA but if you are using a penny of andrews money to fund that hate you are doing a disservice to you husband and aiding your ex", "I'm glad your able to exert power and set your parents straight because you're unfortunately unable to do that with anyone else involved in this story and it is kinda sad.

It could just be a really shitty situation, or you could be able to change the paradigm with some critical moments. A general tone I notice here is dehumanization of individuals in the name of some ideal. I can\u2019t do X because of Y. This person sucks because of this reason. Your kids do it to Andrew and you did it to your parents. What I think this type of behavior usually reflects is that there still hasn\u2019t been enough energy spent collectively on the hardest, meaningful tasks. Just something to reflect on. Hope y\u2019all keep figuring it out. Just don\u2019t resign everyone to a fate where the best we can do is \u201cAndrew ain\u2019t my real dad and he kinda sucks\u201d \n\nI think the best thing to do here is take a step back and look at the WHYs. I\u2019ll quickly summarize what I think and see. The kids feel that way because they don\u2019t want to lose their relationship with their biological father, and becomes a black/white Andrew v dad. Your parents felt that way because they probably see the fractured relationship between the kids and Andrew, and then you just kicked them out of the house swiftly. I think that could mean you\u2019re reacting a little too hastily and shutting the door on a future that could potentially be better. Has Andrew had a real heart to heart with the kids regarding the whole negative dynamic? Communicating clearly he doesn\u2019t want to replace their dad or does it always go through you?  that\u2019s a big blind spot if that\u2019s the case. It\u2019s kind of a case of doing too much, if you\u2019re always the bridge, then Andrew will always remain at some psychological distance. What about the kids relationships with each other, the half siblings? Maybe some more road trips and vacations or something, teambuilding exercises if you will. You\u2019ve got to repeatedly be exposed to some uncomfortable situations and have faith that y\u2019all can work it out to strengthen your relationships. What does Andrew think about all of this? Why wasn\u2019t his perspective regarding the situation really mentioned at all here?", "I would normally say not the asshole, BUT, you set a boundary but did not give them an opportunity to correct themselves, nor gave them a warning about what the consequences would be.  You need to give people the chance to follow your boundaries.  If you had said, in the moment, \"as I told you before, we do not use that language here.  If you continue to use that language, I will have to ask you to leave\", then you would totally not be the AH.  Instead, you blindsided them with an instant consequence without any opportunity for correction or awareness of what would happen if they persisted.  So, I am going with ESH.  Good, fair boundaries require clear expectations, an opportunity for correction, awareness of consequences, and THEN follow-through on consequences.", "NTA for kicking your parents out, but OP, you are all being majorly disrespectful of your older kids' wish to NOT see your husband as their 'new daddy', or '2nd daddy,' because he damn well isn't no matter how great he is, or how much he's there.

That young woman is now almost 20 and it has been a rough ride. Her parents came in and out of her life, putting lies in her head (we were trying to steal her because we didn't have kids of our own. We didn't really love her because she's mixed-race and we just wanted help around the house and saw her as a maid. We had called the cops on them (true one time when the mom tried to pick up daughter when she was high and we wouldn't let her go) and had drugs planted on them (so NOT true; I'm not sure how we could have constructed an entire meth lab in the father's storage shed). They would emotionally manipulate her and because they were so \"down and out\" and (often) sick and (always) needy, and we (my husband and and I, and later our son) were healthy and thriving and \"successful\" (as society tends to define success), they seemed to be the underdogs and the oppressed, and we therefore must be the oppressors. There were some bad times, one very bad YEAR. But we sent her off to college last year, my husband and son and I. I think we were as much a \"real family\" as we could possibly be. \n\nShe's grown a lot since she's been at college. She just started her second year and we had a great phone conversation fairly recently where she opened up a lot. It was sort of an apology and sort of an acknowledgement that we had always been there for her through everything, and that her parents just never were able to be. She told me she loved and appreciated us and that it might always hurt that her bio parents couldn't be parents to her, she knew that she wouldn't have anything close to the life she has now if it weren't for us. This conversation made all those difficult years so worth it.\n\nYour kids see how you and Andrew treat them, and they also see how your ex acts and they hear the things he says. They may not yet be able to see things as they really are, but I would bet that that time isn't too far in the future. \n\nYou and Andrew are doing the best that you can right now, and your parents are just interfering. I can understand them not liking the dynamic they're seeing, but they're not there day in and day out, and don't understand that it's the kids who are dictating this situation, not you or Andrew.

On what grounds do your parents claim Andrew is 'not a father of two' in the household, if he is the father of your two kids by him only, and *your* other two children have a father?!\n\nI don't understand what's wrong with people who think this way. \n\nApart from your ex being a total dick and hurting his children more than anything by planting thoughts in their minds & using them as pawns, your kids *have a father who is in their lives* and has been there *before they even met Andrew.* Why do your parents want Andrew to consider himself a father of 4 ?!\n\nYour children are old enough, they're ok with their father, I mean *why* are your parents trying to say your husband is a father to your teenage children *only* because he married you? \n\nBecause that's who Andrew is to them, your husband and nothing more. In my view 'stepfather' is not topical because (1) their father is still alive and actively involved in their lives, and (2) they're old enough to navigate this by themselves.\n\nMy partner's parents legally divorced when him and his younger brother were 8 and 5 years old, respectively, after a 1.5 - 2 year-long separation. Their dad remarried within one year to a wonderful lady, and their mom also got married quite fast to another super cool guy - which has been great for my partner, as both his parents became happy and content in their relationships and lives after having been quite unhappy together.\n\nMy partner and his brother both feel like they have 'four parents' because they grew up with their parents' spouses in their lives since early childhood. They love their parents' spouses to bits, but call them by their given names and refer to them as 'mom's husband' and 'dad's wife', respectively. Never heard neither my partner nor his brother say 'stepfather' or 'stepmother'. \n\nI come from another country than my partner, and we actually found out our cultures have this similarity, which is the use of 'stepfather/stepmother' only if (1) the child has 0 relationship with their respective biological parents, or (2) the respective biological parent is dead, or (3) both the child and the spouse of their parent *agree* and *want* to be called 'dad/mom' and 'child', respectively. \n\nOtherwise it's perfectly normal to refer to the spouse by their given name, and 'my mother's / father's husband/wife'.

I had a grandmother who loved me, absolutely. We were compatible, and even when I was little we loved just spending time together with either her hobbies (gardening, playing card games) or mine (swimming, tennis). Despite her being my father's mother, she always spoke kindly of my mother, and I had that security in my life. She could give me \"the truth\" and I would believe her. If she had wanted to poison me against a parent, it probably would have worked.\n\n\nMy brother was not compatible with her. He had entirely different interests and while of course she loved him, they weren't close like we were. He struggled an awful lot with the divorce, even though we are very close in age and could equally understand the logic of what was happening. He got drawn in by his preferred parent insulting the other, started trying to play them against each other and took turns choosing who to live with (legal/easy in our country when the split is amicable).\n\n\nI still think the divorce was the healthiest thing to happen and should have been sooner. My brother still thinks it was so incredibly hard on him and him alone and they didn't try to make it easier (one parent got him a puppy ffs). Aside from my own theory of external validation and having that logical view coming from someone you love - some kids are just wired differently and it comes down to whether you believe nature vs nurture (a topic I do enjoy!)", "I was a kid in this situation\n\nOur dad manipulated us from a very young age.  \n\nBelittled mom in front of us all the time, for the tiniest things.  Got it in our heads that she was usually \"wrong\" about things, and he always had the \"right\" answers.  Called himself the \"daddy-mom\" since he had to \"pick up the slack\" of her not doing things right.  When really, he didn't allow her to do things because he was such a control freak and she wouldn't do things exactly his way.  Didn't let her cook and on the rare occasion she did, he always had some complaint to drive home the idea that she was incompetent.\n\nWent so far as to bring us into their arguments, and literally prompted us to tell her how she was \"wrong\" and he was right.  Exposed us to right wing media for hours a day, where we learned how to \"win\" these arguments.  \n\nAt 6 years old, she wanted a divorce.  When she told him, he went and got us and brought us to their room, and told us that \"mommy wants to break apart the family.  Can you ask her why she wants to do that?\"\n\nSo of course she couldn't go through with it with her two kids crying on her lap, knowing we'd think she was a monster if she did.\n\nInstilled a lot of ideas about emotions being weakness.  Him being an overbearing hard ass was him \"preparing us for the real world.\". \"Your classmates are at a disadvantage, because they won't know how to be tough once their parents can't coddle them anymore.\"\n\nHe kept us away from family who he was afraid would expose us to other ways of thinking.  The family he did let near knew they would lose the privilege if they tried to help us when they saw how miserably he treated us.\n\nShe finally divorced him when we were in HS, and from their the abuse escalated, but we still chose him over her.\n\nThe TL;DR is that he brainwashed us and insulated us from other ways of thinking.\n\nAnd the only thing that broke that thinking was time and distance.  I never realized there could be a different way of living until my mom graciously let me stay with her as an adult after his abuse escalated to crazy and physical levels.

It\u2019s to me baffling how alienating people seems to be such a common recommendation\n\nThere are plenty of ways to be intolerant besides just going NC. I didn't realize I had to list every single option, I was just focused on mentioning the most obvious one.", "Oh, I completely apologize. I completely missed who you were originally replying to and only saw the one above. And, I agree. I don\u2019t think you should be getting downvoted for that. The kids are innocent in this situation. I am a child of divorce, and I also have a wonderful stepfather. I also didn\u2019t think he was wonderful when I was in high school, and it took time for me to work through my feelings.", "Well, no. Explaining the rules is when you introduce them, a warning is typically given when there is a violation. Did OP state clearly and upfront the consequence of rule violation? Hard to believe so. \n\nI just wonder if you ever crossed a speed limit and asked to be released by the officer? Or do you promptly pay the fine without questioning?\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to believe one may get so much shit for just preaching a bit of tolerance.", ">Explaining the rules is when you introduce them, a warning is typically given when there is a violation.\n\nExplaining the rules usually comes with the unspoken understanding that breaking said rules will have some form of consequences. With kids, yeah, you need to spell that out bc they're still learning and don't have the understanding that grown ups have. But adults are older and wiser-if you're told \"hey, this is what we do in our household\" you should be able to understand that there are consequences if you don't do what you're told. The very existence of rules inherently implies *some* sort of punishment for breaking them-I don't know any sort of situation where that's never been the case. Parents make rules for kids to follow and the punishment is grounding: the government makes laws to follow and the punishments are fines and prison; your workplace makes rules to follow and the punishment is docked pay or unemployment. \n\n>I just wonder if you ever crossed a speed limit and asked to be released by the officer? Or do you promptly pay the fine without questioning?\n\nJust bc ppl may *try* to talk their way out of a speeding ticket doesn't mean they're gonna get what they want. The driver who breaks the rules has *no* say in whether they actually get a ticket or not-that's fully up to the cops. The same for any kind of situation where you break a rule: the principal can give you detention and your boss can fire you. You can do whayever you want to appeal to them, but that doesn't mean you get a choice. \n\nI don't understand the point of this statement, honestly. So what if the parents tried to get out of it? Does that excuse what they did? Does that take away the fact that they lied to OP, disrespected her home, and threatened to ruin the family relationship between everyone? Do you think actions with consequences as severe as that should be ignored? Bc I think it makes more sense to give the parents some space to allow them to realize how serious OP is, how much they screwed up, and let them come back with a sincere apology and evidence of the effort they intent to make to rectify it (or at least not repeat it). \n\n>It\u2019s really hard to believe one may get so much shit for just preaching a bit of tolerance.\n\nBc there's nothing intolerant about what OP did. Like I said, OP didn't say they were ever allowed to visit again or be allowed near the kids or something. One visit out of the many they have the potential/ability to make was cut short, and the main reason for that was less bc OP is trying to cut off her parents and more bc she needed to stop them and show her kids she didn't support what they were saying so the kids wouldn't be upset and start to treat Andrew poorly again. Letting the parents stay when they clearly showed no interest in preserving the security of household relationships could have opened them up to a disastrous family dynamic. How would you feel if you had someone in your home who was actively destriying the tentative peace you had *finally* managed, especially after telling them how improtant it was?", "I beg to differ. I\u2019m not talking down, just stating that I\u2019d be more tolerant. Conversing with arguments, but not being particularly agreeable \u2014 perhaps because I\u2019m getting sassed and downvoted and all that sort of thing."]}
