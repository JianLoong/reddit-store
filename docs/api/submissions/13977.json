{"id": 13977, "submission_id": "12bjozj", "title": "AITA for refusing to get rid of my cat so he can keep his dog?", "selftext": "My husband and I have 2 boys. I have a cat (6) and he has a dog (2). I've never been a dog person. I knew I had to get over my trauma eventually so after months of harping on me about getting a dog, I allowed it but it wasn't without protest. I actually adore some dogs (like my mom's girl who is hands down probably the best dog on this planet). But in most cases.. I truly just don't like them and it's not the dogs fault, but the owners and lack of training. So when I finally caved and 'let him' get a dog, I made it very clear that he was to train the dog and that I would not be responsible. He got the dog two years ago and she is a terror. 100% my husband's doing. It's not even her fault. \n\nSo.. she still gets in the garbage. Still has accidents inside. Her anxiety is to a point of her whining nonstop and constantly underfoot. She barks and whines whenever she is in the vehicle (and he insists on bringing her everywhere). She's reactive. She's food driven to a point of excessively sniffing the floors for hours on end and never stops until she tires herself out. She stares at you whining whenever you have food. I was just able to get her to stop nipping faces (her idea of \"playing and showing affection\" if you go based off what my husband claims). He is the problem. But it admittedly has made me feel like I'm held captive in my own home. My kids also don't want this dog and never have. But again, it's because of my husband. \n\nWell, we found a rent to own that my husband desperately wants. He fell madly in love with it. We have honestly been searching for awhile but they've made it clear that only one pet is allowed. My immediate reaction was \"well this won't work\", whereas his reaction was \"Who can we get to take the cat\". I told him I wasn't willing to get rid of my cat so he can keep his untrained dog that no one wants but him. He thinks I'm an AH because I \"don't have the same bond with the cat that he does with the dog\". I can see his point, as he has an unhealthy obsession with his dog and she is the exact same way with him. But I still won't do it. He says this may be the only chance we have for awhile to get in to a home (which also could be true). But I still stood firm. He won't speak to me and has been snuggling his dog nonstop for 4 days straight. AITA?\n\nETA: I posted this to another commenter asking for info: I've literally talked till I'm blue in the face about getting her in to training (behavioral especially due to her being reactive and resource guarding). He outright refuses. He says it's a waste of money to pay someone that much money when \"we\" could just do it ourselves. He won't get her medicated for her anxiety outside of THC chews, which simply do not work.\n\nI personally have tried training her on several occasions despite the original agreement being that it wouldn't be my responsibility. For awhile I actually thought I was making headway because all I had to do was snap my fingers at her whenever she was doing something she shouldn't (like getting in the trash) and she would immediately listen to me. However, I'm honestly not sure what happened because despite me still continuing to do everything I was before and being consistent, she no longer listens at all. Like she will stare at me while I snap my fingers to get away from the trash can and continue to do so until I physically get up and walk toward her; which at that point she runs and hides in her kennel growling while staring up at me. Basically she does not see me as an \"alpha\" (I have a dog trainer friend who has helped understand a little bit). She does not respect me or my position in the household and due to this she has stopped listening to me fully. However, now whenever I speak up to the dog my husband immediately gets pissed off and says I'm being too mean. Like I said, he is definitely the problem. He isn't consistent. He doesn't follow the same training I did and I think that's why it came undone. He lets her get away with much more than he should. Ex: she can be outside for 45 minutes, come indoors and shit and he immediately blames himself and says \"aww baby, did I not keep you outside long enough? I will do better next time.\" Or if she gets in the garbage he will insist it's because she's \"obviously hungry and missing something in her diet\".", "created_utc": 1680616006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bjozj/aita_for_refusing_to_get_rid_of_my_cat_so_he_can/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand a man and his dog bond, but entirely unfair to say you aren't \"as bonded\" with your kitty.  Kitties bond in different ways and it would be pretty awful to dump him/her on another family.  I'd NEVER get rid of my kitty!    \nI say he can move there with his dog, or you have to keep looking.

It's REALLY unfair - perceived intensity of bond aside - for him to have assumed the dog would be retained over the cat. That alone would really freaking piss me off. Frankly your other observations about this situation are very big flags in my eyes. I think you all desperately need professional support - therapy for you and your husband, and training for the dog.

The dog is still young enough that its issues can be worked on, in my opinion, but if you don\u2019t want to contribute to its training and your husband can\u2019t see the issues then it\u2019s best for the dog to be given to a home who can take care of it properly. Doesn\u2019t sound like your husband would agree with this course of action though. \n\nSo you have two pets, and it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure they\u2019re both cared for. I agree with your approach of \u201cwell this won\u2019t work\u201d. I would maybe appeal to the landlord if there\u2019s any flexibility regarding the one-pet rule? Even if this works though, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the dog needs proper training and your husband clearly has no respect for the cat. Your husband might be disappointed, but the cat was here first and it was him that pushed for the second pet which is ultimately the reason you can\u2019t get this new home. I agree with you that you should just move on and look for other places.", "NTA This isn't the house for you. He can pay a professional to train his dog. He has to put in some effort himself of course, but there are training facilities where you drop your dog off and the majority of the training is done by them. You still have to participate in this training to some degree. It isn't cheap, but it could definitely help out in this situation.\n\nHis refusal to train the dog is the problem. He is very selfish not just for putting his needs before the family's but because he is not meeting the dogs' needs. I would also check with your vet to see if they recommend someone for training. My daughter took her dog to group classes at a pet store chain which is better than nothing.", "NTA. It seems like your husband is willing to prioritise the dog over you and your children's wellbeing. You had the cat first and he pressured you into accepting the dog, he broke his promise to train it (resulting in bad behavior) and now he thinks the cat is the pet that should go? It's ridiculous but, OP, this is a hill to die on. Not even so much for the cat (though after 6 years I imagine you are attached), but for your kids, who need to see you taking a stance against toxic behavior. At this point, your husband must choose between the dog and his family because if he can badger you into letting him have his way (again), then the next ridiculous idea he has might be even worse.", "If he hasn't taken any proper measurements for this canine to be acceptable in your children and your own eyes, it's his own fault. He begged for the dog knowing well what conditions must be met and still hasn't taken any effort into molding the dogs behavior. If your cat causes no harm and isn't a pain like his dog is, it's his own fault 100% for neglecting it's undesirable behavior. If you were the only one complaining about the dog it would be all on you, but your children are complaining too. \n\nNTA. This obviously isn't the place for you two. Keep searching. Make it clear a marriage is about compromise and if he gets to have his dog you get to keep your cat, period. You're not going to come to the compromise that only you have to sacrifice something.

Your husband also seems like the type of dog owner that makes me dislike dogs (I have 3 cats at my mom's and at my dads 2 rottweilers).
