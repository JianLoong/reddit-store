I\u2019ve asked my ex to be honest many times, and he has even promised our son that they\u2019d talk several times with no follow-through.  At this point, I feel like keeping it from the kids is doing more harm than good, as my son is still holding onto hope that we will get back together.

Divorce is difficult on children, no matter what the reason is. Even if he knows his father is gay he still might struggle to understand the divorce and want his parents back together. Get him to a child therapist who can help him work through his feelings.\n\nEither way, it's not your place to tell. So don't.", "Let him know that if he doesn\u2019t tell them that you will. Give him a date he has to do it by. If he still does nothing then go ahead and tell him", "OP it's going to go into a multitude of directions if you open your mouth, and more than likely when it comes out from other parents who mention it to their kids at school, then your husband is going to have to deal with it himself.  Either wait until the questions come up and tell them to ask him, or tell him he needs to be proactive before it gets to that point.  Either way it's not your place and involve a professional therapist to help guide the path to understanding.", "NTA   Downvote me if you want but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m sorry but your kids are old enough to understand their parents splitting up they are old enough to understand why.   This may actually help create a safe environment for them if they come out in the future or even be a very strong ally.  Your kids are not stupid   They need age appropriate information.  Please provide them with it", "YTA if you out him. You can be honest with your kids that you will not be reconciling without telling them dad is gay. That's a conversation he needs to have - if he chooses not to, he'll be hurting himself more than anyone else, as he'll have to hide everything about his life from this point on. I understand why you want to tell them, but I just cannot ever condone outing anyone, for any reason.", "I get why you want to tell your son but YWBTA for outing him. Kids don\u2019t need these details unless their father is willing to come out. You should try to get your son to therapist and perhaps the whole family\n\nThat being said \n\n>he refused to even leave our bed for 2 years, and then refused to leave the house for another year. \n\nJust because he\u2019s gay doesn\u2019t mean you should be a pushover in this divorce. Put up some serious boundaries, this isn\u2019t fair to you and get a good lawyer", "NTA. You\u2019re divorcing for a reason. It\u2019s not like he cheated on your or did something crazy. He\u2019s gay is a full sentence reason for a divorce.", "Absolutely YTA. Why would you out anyone let alone your children\u2019s father to your children? They\u2019re already going through a hard time with a divorce. It would be awful for you of all people to drop this on them. Him being gay really isn\u2019t relevant right now. If he cheated with a woman and wasn\u2019t gay would you have told the kids that? If so that\u2019s really weird and putting too much on your kids. They\u2019re young and honestly after reading this they should be in therapy to work through this in a healthy way", "YTA. Please don't do this. It's not your place. If you were divorcing because he couldn't get it up or you had cheated with his brother, etc, you wouldn't tell. Your tiny children do not need details, and it's never okay to out somebody", "NTA. I had a friend who had the same issue. She had put her kids in therapy about the divorce. The therapist said it was important the kids learn their father is gay before they hit puberty.  I think it\u2019s easier for younger children to accept", "Soft ywbta. I think we all understand why you want to tell them! But I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do in this situation. It\u2019s not right to out him and if you do then that will be your legacy. You will ALWAYS be the mean ex-wife that outed him before he was ready. That may even be how your kids end up seeing it when they get older. \n\nWhat you should do is put up some boundaries (you still let him sleep in your bed??? are you f*cking kidding me??) and tell your soon-to-be-ex husband that you ARE all going to family therapy. That you\u2019re not asking, you\u2019re TELLING. \n\nDivorce is hard for kids, especially that young! Even if you tell them why you guys are breaking up it\u2019s not a guarantee that they\u2019re going to understand. Family therapy would be a great place for ALL of you to work out your feelings and get some support. Heck, it could even help your ex come to terms with being honest with your kids. He deserves to live authentically and on his own terms just like you do. Family therapy would be the perfect place to assure everyone that things are going to be alright once the storm passes. \n\nDon\u2019t make yourself the villain! There are other options. Get your kids some help and maybe yourself too! I can\u2019t imagine how much you must be struggling right now! I\u2019m sure you could use the support that a therapist could provide. Good luck and I hope things work out!", "YTA\n\nThere are ways to tell your son that your marriage is over, and you 2 will not get back together, without outing him. \n\nIf your son is having a difficult time, perhaps you could find him a therapist.", "YTA \nYou don't get to out anyone to make yourself more comfortable.  This is an incredibly personal decision. You can tell your kids. It didn't work out.  It's nobody's fault. We both love you very much. End of story. There is no reason to push him to out himself before he's ready, either.", "YWBTA. The answer to \"WIBTA for outing [literally anyone] is always YWBTA.", "YTA... Tell me you have a vendetta against your ex without telling me you have a vendetta against your ex. \n\nIt is **NEVER** your place to out somebody. It is not appropriate either. Your kids will find out from the father in good time. Leave it alone. Walk away. And learn to play nice and co-parent.", "YWBTA, but your ex needs to tell him before your son finds out the wrong way  Therapy would probably be very beneficial for you son right now.", "Soft YWBTA. It\u2019s clear you have good intentions but it really is on your ex husband to talk that over with your kids, AFTER they\u2019ve come to the acceptance of their parents divorce. Like other respondents have said, they don\u2019t need the details, they just need to be reassured that they are loved and will always be loved.", "YTA - you have no right to out him. What\u2019s wrong with saying \u201csorry son we just don\u2019t love each other anymore sometimes this happens with parents\u201d\n\nThen get him some therapy. It\u2019s pretty simple.", "Ywbta.  Kids don\u2019t need details of their parents\u2019 sexual relationship(s).  Kids just need to know that parents respect one another and have familial love, but not romantic kissy love, cause things sometimes change over time.", "YWBTA. This is obviously really difficult for everyone and I empathise with you, but outing someone it a truly awful thing to do at the best of times, let alone to kids who are possibly a bit too young to understand what it all means. It\u2019s also not your news to share, but your ex\u2019a. This is something that you can\u2019t undo, so it\u2019a best you and he speak to a ramit by therapist and come up with a plan to tell your kids together in a way that gives them the support they need to process.", "NTA", "YWBTA. They will figure it out soon enough or he can tell them.", "YWBTA. I understand your concern, and it\u2019s true that they could resent you for not telling them. BUT this is for your husband to disclose and if they get mad at you, just let them know that it was out of respect for your husband and the right thing to do. Stand firm and tell them that you will not get back together and to not ask you again. \n \nI would focus on your ex moving out. Its gonna take longer for them to accept these major life changes with him still being in the house.", "YWBTA, but only slightly. Ultimately, if it will have a positive impact on your child\u2019s mental health then he deserves to know, and he needs to know before he is blindsided one day by dad bringing home a boyfriend. That falls on dad to step up and be a man, to put his child\u2019s emotional and mental well-being before his anxiety and ego. I am not much of an advocate for ultimatums, but give him (your STB ex) a time limit of say, 1 year. Within this year he is required to AT LEAST tell your 11 year old, because that kid is watching his home fall apart around him for seemingly no reason, and he\u2019s probably feeling immense guilt or resentment. The six year old is a different ballgame, and how he handles that is up to him. While you shouldn\u2019t out your ex, if he doesn\u2019t uphold the ultimatum then you can tell your son. So at the least he can know it was never him or his sisters fault.", "YTA. It's his business to tell. Stop using your kids to get back at him.", "NTA but I would strongly suggest that you and the looser sit down and discuss the divorce with the kids.  He cannot continue to hide behind you. Using you as a beard for everything.  He is a dad and he needs to step and be one. He wants to continue to put the responsibility on you instead of taking responsibility .  At the end of the day his kids are going to find out he's gay.  He might as well prepare to tell them at some point.  I think he is a sorry excuse of a person. Period", "So YWBTA. And I\u2019m afraid that hearing it from you instead of his father may damage your relationship with him down the road. I think your child could use a therapist to talk to about his feelings around this. It\u2019s not about his fathers orientation or why you\u2019re breaking up, it\u2019s about the fact that 2 people have made a decision that will forever alter his life without any input from him. He needs a safe spot to feel In control again", "NO", "NTA. The show your ex is carrying is his. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay. Since your kids already have a gay dad, it\u2019s better they understand this now rather than later. \n\nAnd, while I get and understand the hesitation to put someone, your desire not to put them can\u2019t come at the cost of your integrity and doing what you think is best for your kids. There are age appropriate conversations you can\u2019t have. \n\nAnd of course therapy and all that\u2026.but if you don\u2019t, your can\u2019t, or it doesn\u2019t get resolved in therapy (therapists aren\u2019t magicians) tell your kids in a way that centers you and why you need t move on; it\u2019s your truth, life, and experience too! \n\nGood luck.", "YWBTA if you out him in cold blood and doing it to be petty. but if he was there and he agreed to do it with you and in front of you then YWNTA. i wish you all the best of luck", "YWBTA - Your soon to be ex is most definitely the AH for delaying this and causing you immense pain, but your children are still too young. There should be a professional therapist involved here, especially for your son. I wish you luck.", "NTA. He hasn\u2019t been fair to you for years. He\u2019s trapped himself as well as prevented a way for you to rightfully move on. A therapy session with all of you should be required to get this news out and to move on. If he refuses you have every right to go to a therapist with your children as none of you deserve to suffer due to his cowardice. I understand that people come out in their own time, but when it\u2019s negatively affecting other people, action is needed.", "YBTAH. Don't subject your kids do grown up issues.  Handle your shit, be an adult.  This isn't middle school.  \n\nThere are ways to talk about divorce that don't involve comments about the other parent's sexual orientation.  Really?", "This is hard because I am of the opinion you never out someone who isn\u2019t ready. For example my daughter (15yo) has friends that go by different pronouns and names at our house and with friends because they\u2019re not ready to tell their parents or they know their parents would kick them out or just wouldn\u2019t approve. \n\nHowever as a mother this is a sticky wicket, as I would choose them over him, your children\u2019s health, mental, emotional and physical, are a higher priority than your husbands feelings. They especially the 11yo can sense they\u2019re being lied to and keeping this secret could do real harm. My ex husband hasn\u2019t been in our lives since my daughter was a baby, and around 9/10 years old is when I started giving her more honest answers about him because before then it wasn\u2019t age appropriate, but being gay isn\u2019t some crazy thing you have to explain in detail. Plus, OP, you\u2019ve already given him 3 years!!! You\u2019ve been patient enough. To me it\u2019s a much simpler explanation than many messy divorces- daddy\u2019s gay, but we still care about each other and love you very much we just aren\u2019t going to be married anymore. \n\nYWNBTA to tell your children the truth.", "This depends on risk management on multiple levels. In certain communities I think you would be potentially putting your husband at physical risk. \n\nThis is an educated choice situation. I think your husband is an asshole for allowing this to go on for well over 11 years but circumstances are key here.", "> I taught in a k-8 school and I guarantee he\u2019s going to hear about this. \n\nThere are only 2 people who are privy to this information: the OP and their husband.\n\nAnyone else who finds out is going to find out from one of those 2 people.\n\nGiven that the OP's description of their husband was that\n\n>he refused to even leave our bed for 2 years, and then refused to leave the house for another year\n\nhe's clearly not going around, shouting it from the rooftops.\n\nSo as the long as the OP keeps their mouth shut, nobody is going to say a word to the kid, because nobody who knows the kid will know.\n\nObviously, once the dad starts dating, that'll introduce new variables and the kid should probably be told by then, but given that he's apparently not even leaving the house, that seems like a ways off.", "NTA at all. I think your husband is TA for stretching this out and bringing everyone down with him. How hard must it be for you to move on when he stayed in your bed and home for so long? And you\u2019re likely amicable so of course your kids are hopeful. Your husband is an adult and needs to get his act together for everyone to move on.", "I think YWBTA for sending a child to therapy to understand a situation whilst lying to them about the situation.  Divorce is difficult in children snd lying to them doesn\u2019t help them.", "That's not really the point at all", "> If you were divorcing because he couldn't get it up or you had cheated with his brother, etc, you wouldn't tell.\n\nYou sure about that?\n\nBecause that's not the vibe I get from the OP.", "NTA\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t listen to these people a lot of them think that just because your gay you can do anything without consequences and the feelings of the people they hurt don\u2019t matter. You should give him a deadline for when he has to have a talk with your son.", "Except, he may soon decide to find a partner much faster than one might expect and then \ud83d\udca5", "Unless the kid overhears them talking and then the kid will feel betrayed...TRUST ME", "It sounds like they all need individual and family therapy. I just fundamentally disagree and believe he owes his kids age appropriate information.", "And, actually read her history about this. He\u2019s running around having multiple sex partners. AND is a teacher at a school. I now definitely stand by my comment.", "To understand their own feelings about the divorce. Which will exist regardless of what they know about it.", "The child doesn\u2019t need to know more than \u201cwe aren\u2019t compatible\u201d.  What the reason is, isn\u2019t causing the child\u2019s problem.  It\u2019s dealing with the separation that is the issue, and therapy can help with that. \n\nShould the child actually need to know (and I don\u2019t think they is likely) the therapist can tell the partners and help the father with it.", "You don\u2019t have to lie. You would say something like, we\u2019re not getting back together but I can\u2019t tell you any more than that. I do think dad needs to be strongly encouraged to find a way to tell the kids though. Normally I say never out someone but at this point I would say that the kids are going to find out and it\u2019s best that it comes from their parents. Family therapy may be the best option to get to that point.", "Who thinks that? All people are saying is that it's wrong to out anyone. How does that translate to gay folk do no wrong.", "this guy obviously cares about his family bc he stuck around for 3 years after coming out to his spouse, still putting in the work to parent his kids. he *obviously* never meant to hurt his family / kids. you have no idea what it's like to come out in that scenario and i'm sure it's something he probably needs to work through in therapy.....not burden his 11 and 6 year old children with that info when he's clearly not mentally ready.", "This. Give him a deadline, but also talk a therapist (everyone), for the best way to handle this. Three years of putting it off and lying to your children is enough. They understand far more than people give them credit for and they will figure it out sooner or later. And if not from OP or OPs ex, it will come out in a much more damaging way to the kids and the gay ex.", "Yep. Any of those scenarios are potentially bad. Plus, it seems dad was bed/home bound for 3 years. Kids notice and tell themselves all sorts of stories. \n\nI get this is dad\u2019s story, but right now that is impacting his entire family. Do I think mom needs to give him a timeline and set up therapy."]}
