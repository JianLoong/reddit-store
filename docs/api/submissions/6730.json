I wasn\u2019t fully convinced but agreed initially. I\u2019ve had 12 months of paid maternity leave anyway.\n\nBut after my leave, he wanted me to stay home and he really wasn\u2019t opened to the possibility of me going back to work even part time. No one would stay with our little girl.\n\nHe works full time and often does a lot of extra hours so I\u2019m work alone all day. I got frustrated with the inability to earn money and having to tell him everything I spent the money on. He needs receipts for his money keeping.\n\nEventually, I grew tired and applied for a part time position in a letting agency. It\u2019s not a lot of money but I can do my 4 hours a day, they allow me to have my daughter with me and I have some money to spend on extra \nthings for my daughter or myself. \n\nIt\u2019s been working amazingly. I was happy, Mo was happy as he would see less \u201cfrivolous\u201d spending. But I kept it a secret because I knew he\u2019d expect me to quit it. Our taxes are separate so it\u2019s not an issue.\n\nLast week, his sister came to the letting agency and we were both shocked to see each other.\n\nShe demanded to know why I\u2019m working and if Mo knew. She told me I was an asshole for keeping it from him and I have a week to tell him. I asked her to please not tell anyone but she wouldn\u2019t let go.\n\nWhen the week was up yesterday, she told my husband and everyone in his family. They\u2019re all telling me what an awful person I am for hiding my part time job and Mo is furious with me, haven\u2019t spoken a word to me after our initial argument. \n\nI told his sister that she\u2019s cruel for telling my secret but she insists I am the asshole here.

That is wild, and shows how skewed your perception has become while living under his rules.\n\nThis man and his entire family are incredibly toxic and controlling. We're not living in Biblical times anymore, and you should not resign yourself to being treated like you are. Be your own person and follow your heart, even if that involves leaving.

You\u2019ve demonstrated that you can make it work, but it\u2019s not what he wants so he will use the fact that you kept it from him to justify his demands that you quit your job. Betrayal comes in many forms and it\u2019s pretty childish to stonewall you for lying when he is being controlling and stubborn.  \n\nAs for his sister, yeah she is an asshole.  Her outrage is over the top.  I can get past her telling her brother that she saw you working.  Her involvement should have ended there.  Telling the whole family was a dick move.

That\u2019s a decision a couple should make together.\n\nHe has no right to control your finances this way. In a respectful partnership with a working dad and SAHM, mom still gets some privacy, some money to spend as she sees fit without dad\u2019s knowledge or approval. The arrangement you described leaves you no privacy and little dignity. And it keeps you completely, completely dependent. As others have noted, that\u2019s abuse. \n\nI\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t feel right to you. It shouldn\u2019t. Your feelings are healthy.\n\nIf that\u2019s the relationship he wants, you can try to convince him otherwise. You can agree to disagree. You can separate. You can submit. Or you can sneak.\n\nYou just tried sneaking but got caught. I don\u2019t think SIL is obligated to keep your secrets, and I\u2019m not surprised she told.\n\nBut the AH isn\u2019t you.

They won\u2019t tell you what to do at all. They\u2019ll support you in deciding what you want to do. So in your shoes, I\u2019d probably look for an agency that offers counseling to people in abusive relationships. It\u2019s often free.

They dont care about you or your kid. They care about Mo and Mo the man feeling manly and validated. \n\nDont try to justify. It WILL only get worse.

He's not requesting receipts for \"money keeping.\" He wants to make sure every penny is accounted for so you aren't saving any. He doesn't want you to have a job because he is \"trditional.\" He was ts to make sure that you don't have a fallback so you can't leave.\n\nControlling finances is one of the main tactics of abusers. Without money, leaving can be difficult or impossible, especially if you don't have close friends or family nearby to help you escape. So is intentionally impregnating someone....throw a child into the equation and it makes it even more difficult to leave. \n\nMy suggestion would be to keep the job and start making a plan to get out.\n\n If you havent already, open a separate checking account that he doesnt have access to. Just because you are married, you do NOT have to put your spouse on it. You might want to designate a trusted friend or relative as a signer or POD. \n\nTake stock of your valuables. Jewelry, any personal  electronics, stocks or household goods like silver, antiques etc. If you have life or accident insurance, call your agent and change the beneficiary to someone other than your husband. Make sure he doesn't have access to your debit, ATM card or checkbook. \n\nMake sure you have all of your documents for you and your daughter; .birth certificates, social security cards (or your countries equivalent) immigration or naturalization paperwork if applicable, passports, your driver's license and other photo IDs, as well as any professional stuff...copies of any degrees, professional licenses, your CV, etc. Any financial stuff....stocks, bonds, retirement or investment certificates, insurance documents, bank statements, etc. Get these together in one place. \n\n\nWait until he is at work, pack a couple of bags for you and your daughter. Essentials...clothes, toiletries, toys and diapers for your daughter. Go to a trusted friend or relative, your clergy if you have one, a crisis center if you \n\nThe longer you stay with him, the more he will control you. Don't wait until you are completely dependent on him.\n\nEdit to add, you might also want to consider renting a box at the post office and start having your personal mail forwarded. This way you can also apply for a low interest credit card or personal loan if you need to , book bus, train or air fares and start applying for apartments or housing without risk of receiving correspondence at your home. You should also consider getting a new cell phone, even if it's just a burner phone from a corner shop and make sure you have all of your important numbers backed up. His first reaction is going to be to shut off your phone and any cards.\n\nOh and thanks for the award, kind stranger!", "Another why are you with these kinds of people\n\nYou can do what you want when you want\n\nBut if you make agreements then stick by them\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been a secret cause you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to that bullshit he wanted to begin with\n\nStand up for yourself and what you want\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be treated like that", "Nta that\u2019s financial abuse like get out they\u2019re made you can leave they don\u2019t want you to", "NTA.

It's one thing to want you to stay home with your child, but to require receipts for every purchase is excessively controlling", "NTA. His sister shouldn\u2019t have told your secret but the more important issue is why you felt you had to keep it a secret in the first place. He can be \u201ctraditional\u201d and you can still have a job and your own identity.

OP, a lot of the behavior you describe from your partner sounds very controlling.

Your husband is abusing you physically by confining you to your home, mentally by isolating you from any other support system outside of him, and financially by not allowing you to have access to money he doesn\u2019t control. In normal households spending receipts are not needed in any way, this is even more extensive control than him monitoring all of your bank statements. Open an account, don\u2019t tell him, keep going to work, and screenshot or record all instances where he is telling you to do these things and bring them to a lawyer. Your husband will tell you that since he has more money he would get custody. That\u2019s not true if you\u2019ve been exclusively taking care of your child. Run fast and run far, he will do anything he can to keep you close. Read about love bombing and cycle of abuse to arm yourself with information so you can resist his attempts.
