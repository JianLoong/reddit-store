Her outrage is over the top.  I can get past her telling her brother that she saw you working.  Her involvement should have ended there.  Telling the whole family was a dick move.

That\u2019s a decision a couple should make together.\n\nHe has no right to control your finances this way. In a respectful partnership with a working dad and SAHM, mom still gets some privacy, some money to spend as she sees fit without dad\u2019s knowledge or approval. The arrangement you described leaves you no privacy and little dignity. And it keeps you completely, completely dependent. As others have noted, that\u2019s abuse. \n\nI\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t feel right to you. It shouldn\u2019t. Your feelings are healthy.\n\nIf that\u2019s the relationship he wants, you can try to convince him otherwise. You can agree to disagree. You can separate. You can submit. Or you can sneak.\n\nYou just tried sneaking but got caught. I don\u2019t think SIL is obligated to keep your secrets, and I\u2019m not surprised she told.\n\nBut the AH isn\u2019t you.

They won\u2019t tell you what to do at all. They\u2019ll support you in deciding what you want to do. So in your shoes, I\u2019d probably look for an agency that offers counseling to people in abusive relationships. It\u2019s often free.

He doesn't want you to have a job because he is \"trditional.\" He was ts to make sure that you don't have a fallback so you can't leave.\n\nControlling finances is one of the main tactics of abusers. Without money, leaving can be difficult or impossible, especially if you don't have close friends or family nearby to help you escape. So is intentionally impregnating someone....throw a child into the equation and it makes it even more difficult to leave. \n\nMy suggestion would be to keep the job and start making a plan to get out.\n\n If you havent already, open a separate checking account that he doesnt have access to. Just because you are married, you do NOT have to put your spouse on it. You might want to designate a trusted friend or relative as a signer or POD. \n\nTake stock of your valuables. Jewelry, any personal  electronics, stocks or household goods like silver, antiques etc. If you have life or accident insurance, call your agent and change the beneficiary to someone other than your husband. Make sure he doesn't have access to your debit, ATM card or checkbook. \n\nMake sure you have all of your documents for you and your daughter; .birth certificates, social security cards (or your countries equivalent) immigration or naturalization paperwork if applicable, passports, your driver's license and other photo IDs, as well as any professional stuff...copies of any degrees, professional licenses, your CV, etc. Any financial stuff....stocks, bonds, retirement or investment certificates, insurance documents, bank statements, etc. Get these together in one place. \n\n\nWait until he is at work, pack a couple of bags for you and your daughter. Essentials...clothes, toiletries, toys and diapers for your daughter. Go to a trusted friend or relative, your clergy if you have one, a crisis center if you \n\nThe longer you stay with him, the more he will control you. Don't wait until you are completely dependent on him.\n\nEdit to add, you might also want to consider renting a box at the post office and start having your personal mail forwarded. This way you can also apply for a low interest credit card or personal loan if you need to , book bus, train or air fares and start applying for apartments or housing without risk of receiving correspondence at your home. You should also consider getting a new cell phone, even if it's just a burner phone from a corner shop and make sure you have all of your important numbers backed up.

You\u2019re allowed to make your own money, and you\u2019re daughter is with you the whole time. What the issue?", "NTA. What he's doing is financial abuse. It's one thing to want you to stay home with your child, but to require receipts for every purchase is excessively controlling", "NTA. His sister shouldn\u2019t have told your secret but the more important issue is why you felt you had to keep it a secret in the first place. He can be \u201ctraditional\u201d and you can still have a job and your own identity.

OP, a lot of the behavior you describe from your partner sounds very controlling.

The problem is how you let him assume authority in your marriage instead of insisting on a partnership.", "He sounds like a controlling AH and you need to get you and your daughter out of there as soon as you can. Be very mindful of your birth control in the meantime, another baby might be his way of getting you back under control and more dependent on him.", "NTA. Your husband is abusing you physically by confining you to your home, mentally by isolating you from any other support system outside of him, and financially by not allowing you to have access to money he doesn\u2019t control. In normal households spending receipts are not needed in any way, this is even more extensive control than him monitoring all of your bank statements. Open an account, don\u2019t tell him, keep going to work, and screenshot or record all instances where he is telling you to do these things and bring them to a lawyer. Your husband will tell you that since he has more money he would get custody. That\u2019s not true if you\u2019ve been exclusively taking care of your child. Run fast and run far, he will do anything he can to keep you close. Read about love bombing and cycle of abuse to arm yourself with information so you can resist his attempts.

I have to save receipts,  but because my husband likely to balance our bank statement..... he often gives me cash for spending money, just because he gets annoyed with all my transactions,  not to control my spending. \n\n\nI mean, this situation with OP is definitely not healthy, OP is NTA. He is definitely controlling l.", "nice anecdote... do you see any of that attitude here?  OP's SO requires receipts, calls wife spending \"frivolous\", works extra hours and has family that INSISTS she not work... \n\nHow is your marriage at all similar to this? \n\n\"traditional\" is a meaningless term peddled by CHRISTIAN EVANGELISTS.  stop using it.", "Not blaming anyone but this is not necessarily abuse, more like incompatibility.\nHonestly it sounds like they are just incompatible and shouldn't be together.\nI would never marry someone who wanted to be a SAHM, but also don't judge the ones that do.\nThis relationship should've ended a long time ago", "It's a response to a comment saying ALL traditional marriages are abusive, which is just ignorant generalization.", "Yeah, that's the thing these so-called \"traditional\" marriages always leave out. The bread winner was only supposed to bring the bread home while the homemaker had full say over how the bread was used.", "Being a SAHM is not the problem here.\n\nThe problem is that OP is required to provide receipts for her spending and the spending is considered \"frivolous\" by the husband. So OP finds a job to avoid being blamed for wanting to spend money on her *and their daughter*. \n\nBut that is not \"allowed\", because \"traditional\". OP even found a part-time job where she can have her daughter with her. So if the husband's point is no other caretakers, that point is moot.\n\nOP is being isolated. She has no money of her own, needs to provide receipts, and it is effectively *impossible for her to leave* if she wanted to because she *has no money*. That is the definition of financial abuse.", "Since you're working now, it's safe to say you're not a trad wife. I was a SAHM but I wouldn't characterize my marriage as a trad marriage. My husband was never the boss of the household.", "But she doesn't say this.\nThe receipt thing is massive assholeish from the husband but nowhere does it say OP has no money, but that she would like to earn it herself.\nShe never wanted to be a SAHM, this is not a good lifestyle for anyone"]}
