Send her a copy of the recipe with your regards, but don\u2019t backdown on the hard copy.  NTA.", "NTA.  OP isn't \"hogging food\", she is willing to provide the recipe.  OP is merely preserving her family heirloom/artifact from damage.", "NTA.  Is the recipe a family secret?  Or would you be willing to share the recipe here? I won't lie, my curiosity is piqued right now.  How good is this cake that made your MIL get so upset so fast.  I really want to try it now lol", "NTA, but your mother-in-law sure is.  Your husband sounds like a good guy.  You offered her a copy of the recipe, why on earth does she need the entire cookbook?  People don't understand what treasures those old recipes are, especially if you remember your grandmother making those dishes.", "INFO: Does she want the actual, singular, physical, paper-and-glue *book* book, or just a copy of the PDF you made of it?", "NTA\n\n\"Ok now you don't even get the recipe. Who do you think you are talking to me like that?\"", "Uh, she didn\u2019t ask you for the cookbook she asked you for the recipe", "NTA OP.  To be blunt, your MIL needs to back the hell off.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get it\u2026 most ppl are like can you give me the recipe not can you give me your entire cookbook???", "NTA\n\nBut I wonder... was your initial response, \"Sure, I'll send you the recipe\" and she said the digital version wasn't good enough? Or did you start with \"I can't give you the cookbook, but here's the recipe.\" She's the AH either way, but if it was the latter, you probably should have known better than to open that can of worms.", "NTA. Please inform her that you are now no longer willing to share that recipe or any other with her. And no longer share any recipes with anyone except your own family members as you likely have in the past. Do not tell anyone that you have several digital copies because she\u2019s likely to snoop. And secure the original fragile one somewhere no one else has access.", "NTA, you gave her the option to have a copy of the cookbook but not the actual cookbook. If she doesn't want a copy then she doesn't really want the cookbook, she only wanted it so you wouldn't have it. Well idk if that last part is true or not but that's what i got from it", "NTA Send her a digital copy, explain again why you wouldn\u2019t give her the physical book and hide the book so she doesn\u2019t help herself to it. You might also ask her how she would feel about lending out a fragile family heirloom.\n\nEdit: put that specific recipe on a group chat, FB, text, etc., that way the whole family can see you were willing to share the recipe. But definitely hide the original. I don\u2019t trust MIL not to do something nefarious with it.", "NTA. Some things, like recipes, are special because they\u2019re exclusive. The fact that you shared a single recipe with your MIL tells me you thought she was special enough to share it with her. Trying for the whole recipe book was a step too far, in my opinion. Hell, my stepfather took his family\u2019s rub to his grave, and I tinkered with one of my own until I got close. My mother told her SIL I had the recipe, and she got mad because he never told her. I had to tell her I\u2019d figured it out on my own.", "NTA\n\nPlease make sure your cookbook is safe. This type of unhinged behavior around someone else's possession often leads to theft or \"accidental\" destruction of said possession.", "Ugh. \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA", "NTA obviously, MIL sounds like an entitled nightmare tbh, don\u2019t give her any recipes, she has no right to them and after acting like a brat after you so generously offered the recipe, she shouldn\u2019t be rewarded for being a turd. \nBut what I mostly wanted to say was HIDE THAT BOOK NOW! I wouldn\u2019t put it past this MIL to come and take it while you\u2019re not there. Find somewhere safe to store it, better to be safe than sorry!\nEnjoy that cake!", "NTA", "If the book is so fragile, you'd print out the entire thing yourself or hire some digital restoration crews to digitally restore the entire thing, and then hand them printed pages to her. NTA.", "NTA. That is a precious and fragile heirloom. Hide it!", "Definitely NTA here", "NTA at all!\n\nEven if this was your mother, you would not be one. You could even be nice and let her have a digital copy, incase she wants to explore some other recipes she might like. But an heirloom? In the kitchen? Nope.", "NtA mil is an entitled B", "NTA your MIl\u2019s being controlling and bullying because she\u2019s not getting her way.  Now you can\u2019t give her the book or the recipe because it\u2019ll only reinforce her bullying.  Glad your husband has your back.", "I love your level of revenge!!", "Bet she thinks OP is not giving her the \"true\" recipe and is giving her one that is not as good.", "I agree that MIL's entitlement is really comical here. \ud83e\udd23\n\nHow dare OP hog food by offering to share the recipe MIL wanted. The *nerve* of some people. /s", "Is it entitlement or something shiftier? Wonder if MiL has a YT channel..... or a source to a publisher. Wouldn't be the first time someone's sold someone else's recipes or otherwise passed them on as their own.", "OP, don\u2019t mention the digital copies at all. She\u2019s gonna demand ALL the digital recipes as soon as you do.", "I don't think she had any ulterior motives, sounds like she just can't tolerate being told no.", "Some folks just want to be treated like they are extra special and get upset when that\u2019s not the case. \n\nI mean, there certainly could be a nefarious plan, but it could also just be run of the mill entitlement.", "Er, sorry but you over exaggerate greatly. In most cases handling old books the standard is don\u2019t have stupidly long nails and wash your hands. No spacesuits required!", "Memories of the meatballs from Everybody Loves Raymond. Tar*rag*gon.", "Best use of \"info:\"", "Came to say this", "I was going to ask as well.", "Yes please. And NTA either way \ud83d\ude02", "Came here to say this.", "This was all I could think as well hahaha", "NTA and I hope OP shares the recipe too!", "Because she doesn\u2019t want to. Why does she have justify it?", "OP literally offered to share the copy. MIL wants the original book, not the copy.", "Loving the Petty Crocker.", "This is the more petty way to go. I love it.", "Agreed.\n\nThe over-the-top reaction to getting the recipe and not the book speaks to her desire to have the book.  It also points to someone not used to being told 'no'.\n\nWhich all means that she might just do anything to get what she wants.\n\nBTW - I'd still give her the recipe and do it in front of a group of family.  That way she can't really complain about \"hogging food\".\n\nIn fact, I might make a Social Media post so that EVERYONE can have the recipe.", "This. Put it somewhere safe. Otherwise, you might never see it again.", "It\u2019s not even no\u2026\n\n\u201cMay I have the recipe?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\nThis should be the end of the story\u2026 Op was willing to give it to her.", "Or worse, she decides she doesn't want to give it back, and it suddenly becomes HER heirloom.\n\nNope. NTA", "I doubt OP planned on giving her the physical copy. Why would she say that she's only sharing one recipe but give them the entire book?\n\nNot to mention OP did say the book isn't really in the shape to be used.\n\nThe fantasies people come up with in the comments here...", "Given her reaction, this sounds about right.", "Exactly. When I share recipes (not old family recipes because we don't really have any), I either type it out as a post or message or I provide them the link. If it were a pdf scan that would be even better because I could just have the image up on my phone or tablet in the kitchen.\n\nMIL is lucky she was even going to get the instructions because people can be very protective of the secret family recipes.", "Maybe she was worried OP would alter it in some way so her cake wouldn\u2019t be as good. If MIL is petty like that she probably assumes other people would be too.", "Yeah, the archive I interned at explicitly only used gloves for handling books that had mold. Otherwise freshly washed hands was standard for books.\n\n(I remember a photo of a book treatment got posted to their social media and at least two comments were people asking why the conservator wasn't wearing gloves.)", ">No spacesuits required!\n\n[Marie Curie\u2019s stuff excepted.](https://www.sciencealert.com/these-personal-effects-of-marie-curie-will-be-radioactive-for-another-1-500-years/amp)", "Completely off topic here, but r/Old_Recipes would LOVE it if you could drop in sometime.   This is exactly the kind of cookbook that'll get plenty of love.", "If this isn't normal behavior from her, encourage your husband and FIL to get her in for a neurology consult.\n\nIf it is normal behavior for her... There are a few subs for that.", "She doesn't have to justify anything, but it very obviously changes the context of the story i.e. not wanting to share the book because it's fragile vs not wanting to share the copy because she doesn't want to share all the recipes.", "OP family not IL family", "Petty Crocker \u2620\ufe0f I love it.", "Okay if I ever have to make a new username for something I\u2019m stealing that!!", "Also make a decoy and on every page of that decoy draw a winky face. \ud83e\udd23", "OUR HEIRLOOM", "Gloves for photographs, glass negatives, and anything else touch sensitive. Otherwise it\u2019s just for tv shows because people expect it.", "Fair point!", "Hahahaha. Take my award. You win", "> Also make a decoy and on every page of that decoy draw a ~~winky face~~ *dick-butt*.", "Fill it with recipes, but leave out one small, essential ingredient in every dish.", "Nah.  Make the decoy recipe **wrong** in some subtle way.  So the result just tastes awful.", "I love this kind of petty \ud83d\ude0e", "Yep, and fun fact newer printed material is much more fragile than old. I spent a wonderful afternoon with an Anglo-Saxon manuscript, so approx 980 - 1000 years old,  no gloves required, the only issue was an overtight  binding whereas the manuscript from 1666 made from offcuts had bits constantly falling off.", "\ud83e\udd23", "I would also include Rachel Green's Triffle recipe (for those who have seen the 'Friends' episode). It only has nine ingredients -  ladyfingers, jam, custard, raspberries, bananas, whipped cream, beef, peas and onions!", "So evil, I *love* it", "So so so petty\u2026\n\n\nI love it! \n\nI would suggest using glue to stick some pages together. Rachel\u2019s beef triffle turned out great!", "Indeed. Rubbish acidic paper, \u2018bindings\u2019 with no stitching. The older stuff holds up much better than modern junk.
