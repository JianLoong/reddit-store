Because if she just wants to make the cake then giving her a copy of the recipe is fine. It would be fine even if the book was brand new. Giving a copy of the recipe is actually better because she can keep it and store it with her other recipes. There is zero reason for her to take the whole book just to make the cake and her reaction is suspicious.

They are kept in a vacuum sealed environment, you have to put on special jumpsuits and gloves to touch them, then you literally cannot even BREATHE on them.  \n\nIt makes me wonder what her ACTUAL intentions were! Was she going to try to keep the book, try to make a profit from it? Ruin it because she doesn't like you? I could list reasons all day, but she SAID she wanted a RECIPE for a specific cake, so what is wrong with just giving her the recipe?
