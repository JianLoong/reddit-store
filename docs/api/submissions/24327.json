We this last June got engaged. My brother (M26) and his now fianc\u00e9 (F27) have been dating for 2 years and got engaged a month after my fianc\u00e9 and I. My fianc\u00e9 and I have set our wedding date for September 21,2024 and have venue and things booked and paid for essentially locking us into this date. I fought very hard to have both of my siblings involved in my wedding my sister is the maid of honor and my brother is a groomsman. Last night I was informed that they had finally set a wedding date and when I asked what it was I was told they are getting married the Friday after my wedding. Yup 6 whole days to be married and then they are getting married. Why this is upsetting is because he\u2019s constantly in the light for everything the one thing I have for myself and he\u2019s found a way to take my wedding week and plan his wedding. Also my honeymoon i specifically planned to leave the weekend after so I wasn\u2019t getting on a plane hungover and or exhausted from partying the night before. And now they want to have me cancel and or move my honeymoon so they can get married. My fianc\u00e9 is angry as am I and said he no longer wants my brother standing in the wedding or his fianc\u00e9 for that matter because he\u2019s not respecting and giving us our time to get married. It\u2019s also going to be hard because now we are going to have to plan bachelorette/bachelor parties and engagement parties and things like that over the next year and will have to fight for time because they can\u2019t wait a few months or a year like they originally planned to get married.

Tell them, you are not able to come to his wedding because you will be on your honeymoon as you told them. You wish them all the best but you can not change this date because reasons.\n\nThen most likly they won't come to your wedding. So you get rid of them without being the AH. And if the still come, you at least get a present from them.", "~~NAh~~ NTA\n\nMight get some hate but everyone is entitled to the wedding they want.\n\nI will admit 6 days gap is very short so I am skirting on slight AH to your brother but ultimately I don't understand why he chose that date as we have no info on that.\n\nEDIT: Just remembered he asked you to cancel your honeymoon. No way is anyone that entitled. Your honeymoon is essentially the 2nd part of your wedding and he wants to interrupt it.", "NTA - Forgetting not factoring in how this impacts you, its very rude to monopolize back to back weekends for the guests who would be going to both weddings. \n\nSometimes people get way too up in arms over wedding scheduling, but not this time. 6 days is not appropriate.", "This really seems intended to be mean. It's a total dick move by your brother. NTA.", "NTA - Its sounds like he is piggy backing off you. Out of curiosity, what do your parents say? Have they enabled this behavior?", "NTA. Your brother is an idiot. I feel for your relatives who will have to pony up two back-to-back wedding gifts. You guys are both going to end up getting boned there.", "NTA.  Don't cancel the honeymoon and let future husband pick who is in his party.  Brother made a choice knowing OP's schedule.  Actions meet consequences.", "In my opinion, NTA. Planning your wedding just a week after someone else doesnt make sense. And then he doesnt have the right to ask you to change the honeymoon's date just because of their marriage. He should have tought twice before deciding the date, If he didnt do that just to \" be annoying\" or something similar.

While it is excessive to expect more than your wedding day to be about you and your husband uniting (notice how I didn\u2019t say about you - the day is not about upstaging your golden boy brother), it is rich of him to expect you to delay your honeymoon for his wedding. You do have a choice though - tell him you can\u2019t make his wedding because you\u2019ve already got plans.", "NTA but does your brother even want to be in your wedding, since he seems to care nothing about your feelings at all? Getting married close to your wedding is not that bad, had he consulted you first, but expecting you to cancel and or move my honeymoon it way out of line. He sounds like a person who would just be happy if you relieved him from his duties and he could concentrate on his own wedding. I would act like his wedding does not exist and keep doing everything exactly as you planned, skip all their stuff and just do mine. Don't help them, don't accommodate them, just enjoy your wedding as much as you can!", "NTA", "I wouldn't change the honeymoon  departure date.  You had everything planned first.", "INFO: Did brother do this out of consideration for traveling guests?", "NTA. I find myself wondering if this nonsense if from the brother or his future bride.  Or huge rivalry between the brothers.  No matter, they have complete gall to ask you to cancel your honeymoon plans.", "NTA. \n\n6 days after for two major family functions is nuts, especially because they are doing it expecting you to shift things for them. If they were like eloping or it was for a very specific reason, then I'd say just do what you want to do, but the unnecessary timeline plus the expectation you move things makes them AH's. \n\nBut I am going to suggest an alternate approach to excluding them: just don't care. \n\n1. Don't move your honeymoon. \"Sorry, we booked that time off already and have begun to put down deposits, so can't change the dates, I hope you have a beautiful wedding.\" Who cares if some of that is a lie, and then DO NOT engage in further debate or conversation about it with anyone. All you need to say is unfortunately the date doesn't work for you and your brother knew of your plans when he chose his date. \n2. Plan your shit when you want to. Their presence at the bachelor/ette parties doesn't really matter, same with the showers, parties, etc. So just plan those around the people you really want there. \n3. Don't move stuff for them, at all. If they want you to be at X, Y, Z, check your calendar and go if you can, but don't move heaven and earth to be at their events or spend money you don't have to support their stuff. \n4. Speak to your parents or other shared relatives about making sure they come to your events and how important it is for them to come. \n5. Be aware of them trying to steal your ideas or take over your planning events (dual wedding dress shopping comes to mind), and don't let them. Leave them out of most of your planning stuff (no need for them to help you pick colors, come to florists, caterers, etc) and keep info about your wedding a little guarded. For example, if there are special things about the day- wedding song, favors, having a dog be the ring bearer, whatever- keep that to yourself. I get the feeling things like this might get stolen and used by them. \n6. If you find that wedding stuff is being told to them AND it is resulting in issues (you take your mom to the cake tasting, future SIL just shows up) then put people on an information diet so it can't happen again. \n\nAnd do all of this with love and kindness. The best way through is sometimes above. Here are your key phrases:\n\n1. I am SO happy for them and hope their wedding is amazing.\n2.  I'm so sad to miss it but we had our date and honeymoon booked and couldn't make it work. \n3. Of course brother knew we couldn't move our date and plans and I so understand this was the date that worked for them, sometimes that's just how life is. Luckily we have our whole lives to celebrate together. \n4. Oh you know they are so busy planning their own wedding, I understand they can't make some of our events. \n5. We are so busy planning our own wedding, unfortunately we couldn't make that, but I sent my future SIL some of the caterers we looked at so hopefully that helped!\n\nConfide in your fiance and close friends to keep these AHs in their lane, and then just enjoy yourself.", "NTA. If your honeymoon is already booked I wouldn\u2019t be cancelling. It\u2019s a dick move on their part, there will obviously be people attending both it\u2019s a big ask to get them to attend 2 weddings within a week.", "NTA - Your frustation is valid, it makes no sense for them to book their wedding a week after yours, sounds like they're just trying to annoy you. Downgrade them to being guests and then  Just say thanks for the invite but ill be going on my honeymoon", "NTA.  Don't change any of your plans including the honeymoon.  \"So sorry Bro but you knew our plans.  We'll be looking forward to seeing the pictures.\"", "NTA.\n\nYou think this was on purpose? Sounds like your relationship is kinda bad. \n\nJust Tell him you cannot attend his Wedding since you are going to your honeymoon. And that you cannot Plan his Party because you are Busy with your own wedding. These are valid reasons. He knew the date sooooo ... He shouldnt expect you to do this stuff.\nIf he Blows up over it you can uninvite him. So far i think it is okay for him to attend? \n\nYou could also confront him, it dies not Sound like you did this so far in your life. But dont turn it into a screaming Match, keep your cool", "You don\u2019t get a wedding week! The fact that you even bring up he should wait for a different YEAR than you to get married shows you are very entitled and an AH. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s first idea is to kick your brother out as a groomsman, which also sucks. Your brother and his fianc\u00e9e should not expect you to cancel anything, that is ludicrous.
