So you may find it boring to be on the phone in bed I personally enjoy it, I\u2019m reading the latest science article and trying to learn my 4th language, finding funny memes, watching tutorials or finding recipes. I find gardens boring but a lot of people like them. I enjoy runs and going to the gym, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of people that find that boring. I play Apex on my time off, a lot of people find video games mundane. I would never tell anyone what they enjoy is boring, it\u2019s relative and I understand everyone does and enjoys things differently. \n\nI was mainly addressing someone that stated staying in bed with a sleeping partner was \u2018torturous\u2019 and it was considered \u2018suffering\u2019.", "Yeah, it's a hotel.

My bf wanted to sleep in and act like it was Sunday. I enjoy staying in bed with my bf but not when there are limited opportunities for sunrise at the beach.

I understand the convenience of sleeping with a nursing baby (which is pretty risky in that you could roll into the baby). I'm hoping that the toddler is only in your bed because you've exhausted all other possibilities of having them stay in their own room in a crib?

I\u2019m sure (well, I hope) you have a self-care habit that requires leaving your child alone with the father for a little while and that may be a little bit annoying to him sometimes; well, this is his self-care that requires leaving the child with you for a little while.

So the husband is going to be awake anyways, so from his POV, he might as well get this workout in. \n\nThirdly, taking 2 weeks off from training is a huge deal. Especially for an endurance athlete and depending on your goals and what part of the season you are in, it may have a big effect in your events. I know for a lot of people it's no big deal, but for endurance athletes it is, since the \"rule of thumb\" is that for every week you are off, it will take 2 to get back to where you were. \n\nHaving said all of that, the biggest lesson that was taught to me by one of my coaches is that we need to give back to those who give us so much. Looks like OP supports her husband's training when he is NOT in vacation, so he should use this time to give back to OP and be with his family. Yes, he will lose fitness, but he can get it back when he returns home. \n\nI know how hard this must be for both of them, because I was in that same position 4 years ago, before I lost my marriage.

Parents are expected to drop (or at least alter) all kinds of different habits when they become parents. It's part of the deal. \n\nYou could replace working out with literally anything else.

Dad probably assumed they would both go back to sleep. \n\nI mean, hell, I don't have kids but I'd probably do a potty break, sip of water, read a story or watch paw patrol and see if the tired comes back. \n\nEveryone seems to assume that \"working out\" is a self absorbed effort for Dad, too. Dad could literally be dependent on the routine and motion to put himself in a good mental place, he's waking up at 5am even on vacation *because it's a routine he enjoys*. Regular, *routine* exercise is good for issues like depression and adhd; breaking that routine could be harder because of all the effort that has to go into establishing a routine. \n\nThe fact that Sonnyboy wakes up at 5am, too, is an unintended consequence that I'm sure Dad doesn't want to be a Thing. But it is. No one's wrong for identifying that Mom has to bear the brunt of cranky child; but honestly it's fucking weird that we must villify Dad for the child being a light sleeper.\n\nI forget what sub I'm on but NAH. \nWork to find a better solution that gets everyone's needs met...maybe it means Dad wakes up a few hours later; maybe he can do an abridged or light routine with toddler, or deconstruct his routine into toddler playtime (find him some monkey bars; deadlift the kid; play tag and get that cardio) Maybe Kid will think it's boring and learn to sleep in or be deadlifted and chased until you're tired anyway lol. But I don't think it's evil to want to stay on your routine even on vacation, and I don't think it's intentional, and that both parents are frustrated by the kid's light sleeper status in different ways.
