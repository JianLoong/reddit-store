Maybe he can sleep elsewhere? Or when he goes to workout take his son if they have a playroom for kids so adults can workout. Sleep is important but so is routine.

It\u2019s a stress relief, meditative, alone time thing. Just like any other hobbies you might do on the daily, that\u2019s how this guy feels about working out. He\u2019s most likely not obsessed with his looks, it\u2019s just his 1 hour of meditation essentially. Most people that have a set routine to go to the gym aren\u2019t the muscle headed gym bro\u2019s you think of. They\u2019re like 5% of actual gym goers.

I generally don\u2019t train as hard while on vacation, but I\u2019d get wildly anxious if I couldn\u2019t at least do some cardio for 10 days straight. Adding to that, OP mentioned that her husband was missing out on training with his brother. I grew up working out with my father, and one of my favorite things about visiting my parents is getting the chance to work out with him again. \n\nI do think that a compromise is needed here, but I don\u2019t think that the husband sleeping on either a cot or the couch is the best solution. Given that the child is only 16 months old, surely he\u2019s taking at least one substantial nap throughout the day. Even if the son isn\u2019t consistently napping around the same time, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to accommodate leaving an hour or two during which no family activities are planned.", "\ud83d\udcaf asking someone to quit their daily workouts for 2 weeks is absurd.

I've never stayed in a hotel that actually offers a rollaway bed.", "This is toxic thinking imo - he\u2019s not a big troublemaker for exercising. If his exercise is important to him, then the couple should plan their accommodations ahead of the vacation to make sure the baby\u2019s sleep is protected and he could get up to exercise.", "NTA. Then maybe he should learn that when you\u2019re a parent of young child(ren), you need to make them the priority, especially when it means not waking up more than one person as a result.

He\u2019s leaving OP to deal with a cranky kid by herself so he can go work out. So yeah, he\u2019s kind of getting a break.

I was trying to establish if he is usually left to cry it out or if he\u2019s used to getting picked up because there are different responses based on his routine. Obviously she can\u2019t let him scream in a hotel at 5 am but if he\u2019s a self soother, it\u2019s the only way he knows to fall asleep so it\u2019s more difficult to readjust.", "Not every needs loads of sleep, I sleep about 5-6 hours and always have", "Yup, especially if I'm not in my own bed.

His wife is not getting any relaxation time if she's being woken up early and then they all spend all day with a cranky baby. She's being stressed out. I doubt it would hurt too much for him to skip the gym or even go after son is in bed for the night so it doesn't cut into family time.

It's sucks that he argued and made her feel bad about it, which makes him TA.\n\nMy comment was in response to this idea that somehow his priority was to sherk parental responsibility. If he stays with his brother, then \"he gets out of fatherly responsibilities.\" Nothing in the post suggests that's his goal. His goal is to work out in the morning, just as he does at home, seemingly without issue.\n\nMaybe I'm biased because both my wife and I maintain our sanity through working out. We have 3 kids. Sometimes, either of us keeping our routine involves dumping some unfortunate kid stuff on the other. I've been irritated in the past if I felt I got the shit end of the deal that time, but I never thought her goal was to not fulfill her duty as a mom. It was to get a workout in because that's what makes her feel good.", "The wording implies he doesn't want to do his fatherly duties. \"Getting out of\" something typically means you managed to find a way out of something you didn't want to do.", "But it really seems that the problem is baby sleeping in the bed with them. \n\nThe solution is to get baby out of the bed and into a crib/pack n play.", "Oh I totally can\u2019t either haha, I\u2019m definitely more of a night person", ">As a kid traveling with my family, I often decamped with my bedding to the bathtub or closet floor just to get some sleep because my family insisted on being awake late/early or making noise. \n\nDamn dude that sounds like a nightmare lmao. Not gonna lie, my family was the same, I liked waking up much later than them. So I get it. Yeah, another room or a cot could work - the problem is idk exactly what noises are doing it. Or is he like turning on a shit ton of lights. If he\u2019s a clutz, maybe bunk with his bro, but that leaves the wife responsible with the kid.

It is the action of getting out of bed that is waking the kid. If Dad isn't in bed, it shouldn't be a problem. \n\nAnd many people are far better humans throughout the day when they've had their morning workout. I don't know if that's the case here, but it's possible that Dad is able to be a better partner when he's had his workout.\n\nIf changing workouts doesn't help, maybe he moves the workout to 6. Or 7.

Stop policing the parent and let the parent parent.", "A couple weeks of cosleep is enough to rest the long-term independent sleep and put them back at square one. \n\nYes kids have a hard time initially adjusting to sleeping in new places, but same as training independent sleep at home, kids will learn to sleep on their own if given time and not given in right away.", "You. I like you.", "I get you, I think it's because she specified weekends are when she does this that others are reacting. she doesn't seem bothered though & maybe his tornado of a morning routine is good during the week for school & stuff", "Not necessarily!
