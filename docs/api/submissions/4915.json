No wonder baby isn't sleeping well.", "I heard it as 'They who choose to wake a child, hath volunteered to take the child' (especially because 5am is stupid, and you shouldn't be waking your partner and kiddo up then anyway unless you genuinely can't help it).", "Why can\u2019t he make sure the kids are taken care of?", "If he gets up at 5am to work out, surely he will be back before wife and kid wake up? \n\nThe only thing waking them up that early is him.", "He is already getting out of his duties by leaving his partner with a cranky toddler at 5am. Better to just be gone all night while he is peaceful and let the peace continue at 5am", "Just because he's getting up early to workout doesn't mean he is getting a break and not carrying his weight during other times. Why are y'all just assuming he's a bad husband just because he tries to get a workout in before everyone wakes up. He's not trying to do it in the middle of the day", "Ya. This detail definitely changed my judgment. NTA", "I sleep crappy no matter what. I wake up 10+ times a night. So I hate sleeping. It's not fun, it's not particularly restful. I also hate wasting time. So between wanting more time and sleep already sucking, I'd rather be using that time for vacation feels. Even if it's just sitting on a balcony taking in New sites. However, I would do everything in my power to keep any children asleep.", "They fall asleep at 9. They miss stuff on the other side of the day.", "As if you can't alter your bodies natural sleep cycle in literally 3 damn days.", "We\u2019re not all the same, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. Yeah, lying there trying to be silent and still when you\u2019re wide awake? Not so fun. Coffee beacons too strongly.", "Ok, fair enough.", "I'm sure they don't want to have a perpetually wailing baby in the evening at a hotel.", "The hotel might not have a crib for them. My kid outgrew the pack and play before 16 months. A kid left alone to cry for a minute in their room might self soothe, but might not if they're in the same room as their parents. The kid is unlikely to calm down if he can see and hear his parents just outside the crib. The things that work at home likely will not work in a completely different environment because it is different. This is why vacations require flexible sleeping arrangements when kids are involved.", "He\u2019s got a 16 month old.  If he can\u2019t adapt to changing his sleep or exercise routine occasionally to accommodate his kids needs, and dumps it all on his wife to deal with, he\u2019s an AH who should not have decided to have a kid.\n\nWhat does he do when his wife is sick or exhausted?  Go to the gym every morning anyway and leave her with the toddler?", "The baby shouldnt be forced to wake up at 5am in a strange environment", "Commentor is correct tho, at least in principle. The problem, though, is we don't know the specific details on the OPs sleeping situation, and I have to assume, as a reasonable human being, that OP wouldn't have posted this if \"just sleep in another bed\" was a working option.", "I actually think that it would be very odd for a toddler to not be sleeping in their parents bed while on vacation. Most 16 month olds are not safe in a standard height hotel bed. \n\nI think you\u2019re missing the point of the entire question, it was surrounding OP asking partner not to workout on vacation. There was no mention of an option for the toddler to not be in their bed or that the OP was the one wanting the child in their bed.", "Super useless and not at all applicable to anything but your almost certainly made up anecdotal bullshit. Thanks so much!\n\nEdit: you spend way too much time on this sub", "Well, my karma has really taken a hit on this one.  Perhaps I jumped the gun.  I should ask: does he sleep in his own bed at home?", "It sounds like OP\u2019s husband is not getting up quietly, given that his idea of compromise is that he will be quieter when he gets up.", "Because every child is the world is the exact same\u2026.", "So when you say \u201cit\u2019s your choice\u201d you meant both parents? Cause it sure sounds like you\u2019re blaming the OP and holding the dad harmless over the situation. It doesn\u2019t sounds like the dad offered any solution other than he gets to wake them up every day, so why is this all OPs problem to solve? \n\nMy guess is there was one bed and they had a travel crib that the baby wouldn\u2019t sleep in, and I don\u2019t think either of them are the A H. Sometimes things are just hard traveling with a baby and that\u2019s just how it is.", "that\u2019s not a compromise.\n\na compromise is supposed to be an agreement acceptable to both parties, not just one. even if he were \u201cmore careful\u201d, he\u2019d still be waking up the kid which isn\u2019t solving the issue.", "And why tf is it always mom\u2019s responsibility when hes the one being disruptive?", "Have you ever slept with a baby in the same room? The chances of the baby sleeping through him getting up and getting ready are slim to none no matter where the baby's sleeping.  She answered it in comments both the age and where they're staying.  Edit to add the staying with the brother is only option that you named that would guarantee the baby sleeps longer.", "What part of in a hotel was hard to understand? There may not be another bed available and even so in the same room it's most likely the baby would still get woke up.  A 16 month old does not adjust well to sleeping in strange places so co-sleeping is best way to insure they get any sleep at all.  And 2 weeks is not an eternity it's not going to hurt the child.", "Lol because I love seeing my kids first thing.. and also... I do my best to calm grumpies. So I get them settled. And crawl back into my nice bed. \n\nAs soon as I know he has them? I'm out like a light lol.", "Agreed. Dude wants to workout in the morning and suddenly he's \"getting out of doing fatherly duties\".", "My comment was in response to him sharing a room with his brother.", "Yup. I hate sleeping. It's stressful. There are plenty of times when things are literally life and death at work and I need good sleep. On those nights I look at my bed in absolute cold sweat knowing what I'm in store for over the next 8 hours and the following day.\n\nOn vacations I take a break from sleeping. If I wake up 2 am in the morning I just jump out and walk the streets of Paris, walk on the beach, and there is no reason to worry cos no one gets hurt due to my brian fog.\n\nBut yeah if I wake up the kids then I take the kids with me.", "Eh I could sleep 9pm-5am and still feel like absolute crap waking up. It\u2019s the quality of my sleep, not the quantity, unfortunately for me", "If they're sharing a bed with a light sleeper I gotta believe they're going to bed when this kid does. I'd be restless by 5am.", "Yeah, on my days off I wake up 5-6 and go to bed 10ish. There's nothing on later that interests me to stay up for and I love a long walk first thing in the morning and to have completed 5 tasks by lunchtime.", "Eh, not necessarily. I rarely go to bed before 11:30 pm. I'm still awake at the ass crack of dawn every morning no matter what I do because I'm stupidly light sensitive and will be awake the moment the sun starts making its presence known. My dad's the exact same way. Only way I can avoid it is with really good blackout curtains and you rarely get those on vacation.", "Nope. I have brain cyst induced insomnia and I fall asleep between 3 and 5 and I\u2019m up between 6 and 7:30 every day.", "Nah not at all, some people just need less sleep than others in general. I have always been a light sleeper and feel fully rested on 5-6 hours. My wife would rather sleep 8-9 and still might want a nap.  If I go on vacation somewhere I dont want to spend all my time sleeping in a hotel....", "I've been trying to reset my internal clock for my entire adult life. That's over 40 years, btw. It isn't that bloody simple for everyone. Look up Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome, get off your fucking high horse, and stop being ableist.", "This was actually my first thought when I read the post. I was like\u2026 if he woke the child up why doesn\u2019t he take them and the wife can sleep.", "This might not be good for the kid, but it is a far more reasonable suggestion than lot of the other comments.", "Why would a child wanna be woken up at 5am?", " Except OP says kid is in a bad mood because he woke up too early. So no, getting kid up early doesn\u2019t  work, so hubby has to both lose out on exercise and time with his brother, and is not able to get up when he wakes up. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why OP cannot rest with the child later, but I suspect she also does not want to miss out. Or find a solution for bubs sleeping arrangement which is not their bed.", "Studys have shown that you can\u2019t \u201cmake up\u201d a good nights rest. Deep sleep at night and a little nap dont equal each other. So waking her up so early is kind of hurting her.", "First of all, you're STILL making assumptions about their accommodations, information we do not have.\n\nSecondly, giving mom a nap time is not a solution to the problem. The issue is that the kid is waking up. Now, this, by extension, is an issue for both parents of course. But the point remains that this can't be fixed by \"give them a nap time later\". I also simply do not believe that anyone has ever been *physiologically forced* to wake up that early, and if you can, eventually your body will exhaust itself until you stop.", "lmao dude chill, I never suggested the final judgement was \u201che should stick to his routine no matter what\u201d. I just said it\u2019s something important enough to look into some creative troubleshooting. If they exhaust their options and there are none, then obviously the kid and sleep first, easy. \n\nJust why jump to him changing his behavior *first*; that\u2019s when people get emotional and start accusing each other of shit they don\u2019t mean. Try to solve the problem in a way that best satisfies all parties (if possible, ofc, idk what they\u2019re working with); parenthood is nothing but trying to solve a series of constant problems. It\u2019s also hard as shit so i can see why they\u2019d both be irritated, not judging them for that. It\u2019s understandable. \n\nThat\u2019s why NAH imo.\n\nedit: also, **he did decide to give it up** so no, he\u2019s not an AH as you believe. He\u2019s capable of being there, he just wanted to state his case, most likely. Cheers.", "the movement would prob wake kid up anyway. getting dressed. leaving room.", "Well hopefully no one has to get up an pee then. Responsible parents would book at a hotel that offers rollaway cribs if it was that big of a deal.", "I have family that work for DCFS and they preach separate beds for safety.", "The tone of the original post implies that the OP is driving the ship/making the decisions. While the co-sleeping (and indeed all of these decisions) should be discussed and agreed on by both parents, if OP is drawing the line and \u201cmaking him stop\u201d exercising, it\u2019s not a stretch to believe that the co-sleeping was her call too. \n\nIf we are goi g deep into reading between the lines, given the scarce info provided by OP, it seems that this nuclear family of three is on a trip with the husband\u2019s extended family. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine that he is not fully pulling his weight in the parenting department in favor of wanting to hang with his brother etc. and that OPs patience may be wearing thin on a number of levels. So pulling in the reins on the workout piece may be her way of getting some balance back in responsibilities. And if that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving this, I\u2019d come down more firmly on her side. But as written, i think she\u2019s overreacting and should look for compromise over laying down the law.", "I did not read all of the responses, but the vast majority were claiming NTA. But I think at the point of getting another bed it should be for the infant, not the husband.", "Hey I read this entire thread and I think you\u2019re a saint for taking on tommylookyloo, what a dolt lol", "It is a solution, it's not just her vacation but his as well and he came up with a functional solution but op wants to shame him into giving something up because it's a inconvenience to her. Naps are a very real option.", "Good for u? Ppl have different experiences", "It will hurt the kid and the parents. Aside from the fact that smothering a 16 month old child is a legitimate concern, the kid could sleep on a couch in the room. Anywhere besides their bed. Two weeks is an eternity when in close quarters. They could also ask for a pack and play. There are a number of options that don't require sleeping in the bed. Have you ever been on a vacation with a 1 year old? Doesn't sound like it.", "I could sleep 9p-9a and still feel like crap even though i swear i sleep well lol", "I could *not* sleep 9pm-5am because my brain would simply not accept to sleep that early. xD", "Block out the sun with makeshift cardboard, plywood, something. To suffer like that is not a vacation.", "Ask for an airline room. Some hotels have them and they may be available to other guests.", "I never managed to function in the morning to the point where I have no choice but to work shift work, evenings and nights. The rare morning shift I pick up I'm like a zombie.", "He doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m saying if hubby gets up at 5am and the kid stays asleep then great. If hubby gets up and wakes kid up then he need to deal with kid then and later once kid gets crabby and needs a nap.", "I\u2019ve read of those studies. It\u2019s hopeless. If you miss one night\u2019s good sleep, hello cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. we\u2019re all screwed, per those studies. They only need to be creative and to compromise.", "I wake up, every single morning, between 4-5 am. My dad did too, maybe it\u2019s genetic. I do admit that if he wakes up that early and the kid wakes up that early he can take charge of the kid as long as he gets his exercise later. But if mom expects quiet with both hubs and kid awake they\u2019re still going to have to seek a compromise.", "Peeing at 5am isn\u2019t an issues for most", "the child is in an unfamiliar environment on vacation. it\u2019s understandable that they are more comfortable sleeping in their parents\u2019 bed as they aren\u2019t at home. \n\nhe\u2019s the only one waking up at 5am, he should be the one with the rollaway bed to not wake up wife/kid", "Getting up later is an equally valid and in fact far more reasonable option. The suggestion that he is somehow obligated to work out at 5AM is absurd, and if he literally has to or he will...I dunno, explode, go sleep with the brother. Or, if possible, sleep on the couch or something.", "Have you since you're suggesting putting a baby on a couch?? That would be much more dangerous than co-sleeping! And I have 2 kids and both had to share my bed during trips at one time or the other and they're both perfectly fine well adjusted ones a preteen and the others grown.", "[deleted]", "I am literally asking what about your experience has led you to this conclusion. Your comment still shed enough light though. From my experience, you\u2019re just an angry, sexist loon.", "Often that is a symptom of sleep apnea, worth looking into.", "Thank you for being like me!", "I definitely don\u2019t sleep well haha. I wake up very often and have vivid, slightly unsettling dreams and am very restless. So fun!", "They can seem like that. I had to do a research paper on it in like my first year of college \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but the general consensus (from what i remember) is short term sleep deprivation has side effects like moodyness, forgetfullness and just like general brain foggyness, that can last WEEKS after it happens. Long term sleep deprivation makes you more susceptible (which doesnt mean your 100% gonna get them, youre just more likely) to cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. but yea, not all people are gonna have those sode effects. Much like not everyone that smokes will get lung cancer, its just more likely.", "If trips are a future occurrence, they should get used to it. Would it be any better if he was away for an hour or two during the day during normal hours? And they were the only one to take care of the infant? \n\nIf you want two beds, I'd say get two queens, instead of a king and that would probably solve the issue. But I think OP would probably still complain.", "Waking up at 5 AM is absurd to othera. The guy sticks to his routine and is willing to be quiet and jnstead of communication he gets shamed and guilted into stopping. It's easy to slide out of a routine once the excuses start coming up and from the sound of it he isn't hurting anyone.", "I would suggest the pack and play from the hotel first, but my point still stands. Two weeks is forever with a one year old. Let the guy exercise. If she needs to sleep that badly, take an afternoon nap. Or right after he gets back. The vacation isn't all about her.", "Not sleeping mostly. The little ones I know all kick and twist and spread out.  Being tired and on vacation is not great", "See also adhd, anxiety, and others.", "If he can get up more quietly, he is TAH for not doing that from the beginning!", "[deleted]", "Why can't they work out at 7 am? Its vacation.... There are no time constraints. This feels purposely incendiary.", "Well she probably thought she did until the husband went to exercise."]}
