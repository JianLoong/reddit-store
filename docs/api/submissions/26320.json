You say he can eat cereal or toast\u2026 neither of which works for an easy meal after an hour of swimming, and he\u2019d need six or seven bowls of cereal, or 10 pieces of toast to make up for the calories lost to swimming, let alone the calories he needs as a growing teen to get through the morning until lunchtime.", "I think I\u2019m just kind of confused- I was packing my lunches for school way before 15.

Even if he ate before practice, he would likely still be hungry afterwards as 1. most people are hungry after physical exertion and 2. He's a teenage boy! They eat...a LOT!

I fed them breakfast after weights and they then ate breakfast at school.  When I picked them up from school I had almost a complete meal packed, cheese, fruit, milk, etc.   Then they were at swim practice again from 5:00pm to 6:30pm.  When I got them home, I made sure I had food ready (crock pot) or my youngest would be crying he was so hungry.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, if your son is serious about swimming, you should talk to his coach and get an idea of just how many calories, the right kinds of calories, he needs to be eating to not only be able to perform at a high level in his sport, but also be able to function during the school day.  \n\n\nI don't think your \"immediately\" an AH.

Seems like most of you here were never told no and given whatever you wanted.", "If he has the option to eat at home or you give him food to take, then he needs to suck it up. Gotta budget. But you can't withhold food from him. I could see not wanting to eat before swimming... So perhaps you could help brainstorm with him what to pack and how to do it for the first week. Do it with him for a week and then he should be able to do it on his own. You still need to make sure he has access to the calories he needs for his athletic activities.", "NTA, He can pack a lunch. I never had an allowance and ate fine.", "YTA. It sounds like it's not really practical for him to eat before swim, and as a result he's forced into a more expensive breakfast option than your daughters are able ot make use of. \n\nIt's fairly disgusting, to be frank, that a parent of a teenager who attends school full time and has a rigorous physical activity, when told that child is going hungry, feels the need to hold a firm line rather than, IDK, make sure the kid is able to eat.

You keep saying he can pack a breakfast, but clearly he can't because he's not. The physical ability to put food in his bag isn't the only criteria for \"he can pack\", and as a parent it is your responsibly to identify what's keeping your fifteen-year-old CHILD from receiving adequate nutrition. The grab-n-go options you've described in the comments, mostly bread and sugar, are not filling enough for a teenage athlete. Examine your reaction to his request and make sure it isn't just a power struggle. Why is it important he pack at home instead of accommodating the meals he's telling you work? How much time does he have for food prep the day before? Does he know recipes that won't be icky over twelve hours later? Don't tell me the answers, talk to your kid about what's sticking for him. Telling him to figure it out or go hungry is NOT teaching him the lesson you want him to learn. Model the damned behavior you want to see and walk him through repeating it.", "NTA.  All of these replies are evidence for why so many kids aren\u2019t prepared for living on their own.  It is perfectly reasonable for him to take food with him from home.  He is choosing to spend allowance on breakfast rather than packing breakfast.  This is how kids learn to budget and make choices and that their choices have consequences.  I helped my daughter research solutions and made sure I bought what was needed so she could have a healthy high caloric breakfast and snack for those crazy early cross country practices.  Yes- it\u2019s very important to eat enough with intense sports- but no that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to buy breakfast at school.", "NTA.

My ma would always send me with a 2 sandwich lunch and 5 dollars to get a couple slices or snacks. You're not the asshole but make me grateful for my ma. I had a friend who used to basically show up just for lunch because he wasn't going to get fed without showing up.

His appetite his through the roof. My husband and I have been telling him and teaching him that his body is a machine and like any machine it can either work well, or run out of gas. The better nutrition the better his body will carry him during competitions, practices etc. My son now sits down with us and we plan his meals with him (pre sport, not family dinner). \n\n Your son should aim, at the very least, for a bagel and PB before his practice (add cut up banana and drizzle with some honey for added nutrition).

I have spent the last four months *begging* him to tell me what he would be willing to put into a lunchbox and/or eat at home before school. Nothing I do or say will make him put one bite of food into his mouth until at least noon, but at least I have recently found literally five different types of expensive protein bars that he is willing to put into his lunchbox. He now takes three protein bars along with the fig bar and the gummies, and this was only after a months-long fight where I was almost in tears just begging him to put *any* fucking sustenance into his body. \n\nAnd to be clear, he is in excellent shape. He is thin and muscular, he's never been overweight, but he's also never been unhealthily skinny - I don't think it's any sort of eating disorder, which I definitely considered.

For swimming I'd have peanut butter oats on bagels, premade protein bombs that me and my mom made, etc. Dude just wants to buy breakfast at school cause all his friends buy food at school and don't bring in stuff from home cause that's 'uncool'. That's from my personal highschool experiences at least. I did long to be 'cool' and buy the sugary breakfasts from the school cafeteria. But, yeah, that's not at all helpful to him as a swimmer, just fyi. And if he's super hungry after swim, before classes, OP makes mention of all the things he could be packing to eat in the interim. Like I mentioned before, peanut butter on a wheat bagel worked wonders for me after practice, along with some fruit or something.   \n\n\nAnd also, it is practical to eat before swim, just not Right before.

Would I want her to be up at 4am to make her own food, when she has to study, do homework, after school activities all the night before? Answer is no, because I would like for her to be able to get as much sleep as she can so she can continue to excel in the things she does.

This is not fuel for an athletic teen, especially a swimmer. \n\nSide note: I once was present when my ex-SIL gave my young niece a pop tart for breakfast. I was also present when the child had a sugar crash less than an hour later, complete with a mean headache. That\u2019s not food, it\u2019s candy trying to dress as food.

This kid needs to be taught how to cook meals. This kid needs to be given the tools (&ingredients) he needs to be ABLE to cook for himself. Because the food you have is not filling. Not for a normal person, certainly not for an athletic individual. What does your pantry look like? It doesn\u2019t need to be stocked to the brim with EVERYTHING; most people are creatures of habit and are repetitive in their food choices. I like breakfast sandwiches, chicken wraps for lunch, and some sort of grilled meat with zucchini or red pepper for dinner. That\u2019s it!

Do they seriously think anything he can buy at a public school cafeteria for breakfast is going to be anywhere near as healthy and protein-filled as 3 or 4 hard boiled eggs, a protein bar, fruit, and a bagel with cream cheese from home??????? \n\nWhat am I reading. I have never been so baffled by a comment section in my like 13 years on Reddit. Are the people commenting here just incredibly, over the top rich where they have private chefs at home and go to private schools where they serve Michelin-starred food????? How could anyone possibly think he would be getting a fuller, more well-rounded breakfast from a public school cafeteria in the morning. What. On.

The point was just that he needs the balance.", "I managed to pack my own meals in high school while working, being in AP classes and doing sports. It really doesn't take long.", "I do teach them food prep. Just at a more appropriate time. Like the weekend or on holidays. As for time management I think they manage their time pretty well in doing what they need to do. They wake themselves up to get ready for school, they manage their time doing homework, extracurricular activities (my daughter does soccer, piano, ballet and modern dance), they make time for friends and family, some downtime and bedtime. But they\u2019re kids. They have their whole life to be adults and have to wake up super early to adult. Let them be kids when they can. The skills they pick up are already valuable and they don\u2019t have long to go till they\u2019re proper adults. At this point they\u2019re still developing, and it\u2019s unfair to enforce adult level of responsibilities on 14/15 year olds.\n\nEdit - typo", "For context at 5'2\" and 115 lbs, I would eat 3 oatmeal packets and a bagel and/or two pieces of toast with toppings after morning swim practice.

I ate two full suppers (one after school and one around 8PM) on any days that I had evening swim practice, and any days without evening practice, I'd have one supper, but of substantial portions. \n\nRegardless, this parent is not providing enough food of appropriate quality for a 15 year old boy involved in a high-performance sport.\n\nIt's also laughable that they are comparing it to their daughters' eating habits, where I see no indication that the daughters are involved in similar caliber sports.", "dont you know? US schools only offer the highest quality, farm to table breakfast options! /s", "I think this question is the funniest intersection of Reddit and really shows how age skews perspective here.\n\nPeople are basically calling it torture that a 15 year old has to pack food for his day.

That feeling of something warm hitting the belly when you\u2019re chilled through, nothing like it.\n\nMaybe send the kid with a thermos of tea with a cold breakfast, or chili or something else really filling and warming? A chunk of cornbread and a bit of cheese on the side, and kid would be in good shape. It\u2019s not traditional breakfast food, but honestly most common North American cold breakfast foods aren\u2019t that great as fuel.

Dad loved making us cry. \n\nMy food intake was strictly controlled until I was about 17, my mom wanted me as skinny as possible without being officially underweight. I was put on my first diet at 11. I was 4 foot tall ish and weighed about 75 to 80 lbs when I started it. My friends at school took it upon themselves to give me food. Id get so hungry I'd vomit bile. And now I have serious issues with overeating so that's great.", "I'd agree the responsibility is on both, but slightly more towards the mom. Purely on the basis that establishing good eating habits and a healthy relationship with food should have started LONG before swim team and teenage bottomless pit behavior came into the picture. Allowing it to get to the point where this kid is going hungry is an issue. I was in college before I fully realized that having a salad once a week and casseroles loaded with cream of (fill in the blank) soups the rest of the time wasn't actually healthy. I do better now, but it was a lot of unlearning and relearning I had to do. \n\nBut yes, kid should absolutely be able to have the responsibility of making an appropriate breakfast for himself, even if it's meal prepping the night before. Mom (and dad) just needs to make sure kid gets to that point reliably.", "Definitely can agree with this. But a 15 year old generally eats how they\u2019ve been taught to eat.

It is a sweet carb 85% of the time if not more.  Once in a while it's an egg sandwich or breakfast burrito with egg and cheese, but usually not.\n\nThat's why my kiddo likes it so much: donuts, muffins, pastries, pancakes, sweetened fruity yogurts, canned fruits in syrup, served with juice or chocolate milk, rather than the eggs, plain greek yogurt, cheerios, fruit or oatmeal he gets at home.\n\nIt is absolutely not more nourishing, although arguably might be more calories.\n\nObviously this kid needs to be fed, and OP needs to make that happen, but I think people who are arguing that he NEEDS to have the food at school rather than anything it's possible to pack at home, every single day, shows that they probably aren't familiar with what US schools are feeding the kids in the morning."]}
