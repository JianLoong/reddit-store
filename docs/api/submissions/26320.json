You say he can eat cereal or toast\u2026 neither of which works for an easy meal after an hour of swimming, and he\u2019d need six or seven bowls of cereal, or 10 pieces of toast to make up for the calories lost to swimming, let alone the calories he needs as a growing teen to get through the morning until lunchtime.", "I think I\u2019m just kind of confused- I was packing my lunches for school way before 15.

Even if he ate before practice, he would likely still be hungry afterwards as 1. most people are hungry after physical exertion and 2. He's a teenage boy! They eat...a LOT!

I fed them breakfast after weights and they then ate breakfast at school.  When I picked them up from school I had almost a complete meal packed, cheese, fruit, milk, etc.   Then they were at swim practice again from 5:00pm to 6:30pm.  When I got them home, I made sure I had food ready (crock pot) or my youngest would be crying he was so hungry.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, if your son is serious about swimming, you should talk to his coach and get an idea of just how many calories, the right kinds of calories, he needs to be eating to not only be able to perform at a high level in his sport, but also be able to function during the school day.  \n\n\nI don't think your \"immediately\" an AH.

Seems like most of you here were never told no and given whatever you wanted.", "If he has the option to eat at home or you give him food to take, then he needs to suck it up. Gotta budget. But you can't withhold food from him. I could see not wanting to eat before swimming... So perhaps you could help brainstorm with him what to pack and how to do it for the first week. Do it with him for a week and then he should be able to do it on his own. You still need to make sure he has access to the calories he needs for his athletic activities.", "NTA, He can pack a lunch. I never had an allowance and ate fine.", "YTA. It sounds like it's not really practical for him to eat before swim, and as a result he's forced into a more expensive breakfast option than your daughters are able ot make use of. \n\nIt's fairly disgusting, to be frank, that a parent of a teenager who attends school full time and has a rigorous physical activity, when told that child is going hungry, feels the need to hold a firm line rather than, IDK, make sure the kid is able to eat.

You keep saying he can pack a breakfast, but clearly he can't because he's not. The physical ability to put food in his bag isn't the only criteria for \"he can pack\", and as a parent it is your responsibly to identify what's keeping your fifteen-year-old CHILD from receiving adequate nutrition. The grab-n-go options you've described in the comments, mostly bread and sugar, are not filling enough for a teenage athlete. Examine your reaction to his request and make sure it isn't just a power struggle. Why is it important he pack at home instead of accommodating the meals he's telling you work? How much time does he have for food prep the day before? Does he know recipes that won't be icky over twelve hours later? Don't tell me the answers, talk to your kid about what's sticking for him. Telling him to figure it out or go hungry is NOT teaching him the lesson you want him to learn. Model the damned behavior you want to see and walk him through repeating it.", "NTA.  All of these replies are evidence for why so many kids aren\u2019t prepared for living on their own.  It is perfectly reasonable for him to take food with him from home.  He is choosing to spend allowance on breakfast rather than packing breakfast.  This is how kids learn to budget and make choices and that their choices have consequences.  I helped my daughter research solutions and made sure I bought what was needed so she could have a healthy high caloric breakfast and snack for those crazy early cross country practices.  Yes- it\u2019s very important to eat enough with intense sports- but no that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to buy breakfast at school.", "NTA.

How do they deal with swim day breakfast?", "NTA. Some in this thread seem to be missing where you said he can either eat before practice or pack something.

They also bought a lot of snacks for me to bring to school with me to eat throughout the day because they knew I was burning through calories like they were nothing. If I wanted to buy any other food, that came from my own money.", "I played 3 sports in High School and burned so many calories. My ma would always send me with a 2 sandwich lunch and 5 dollars to get a couple slices or snacks. You're not the asshole but make me grateful for my ma. I had a friend who used to basically show up just for lunch because he wasn't going to get fed without showing up. You don't have to pack it for him but knowing my son was hungry would make me want to take 5 minutes out of my day and set up some food for him.", "I don't get all the Y T A judgements.

The better nutrition the better his body will carry him during competitions, practices etc. My son now sits down with us and we plan his meals with him (pre sport, not family dinner). \n\n Your son should aim, at the very least, for a bagel and PB before his practice (add cut up banana and drizzle with some honey for added nutrition).

Nothing I do or say will make him put one bite of food into his mouth until at least noon, but at least I have recently found literally five different types of expensive protein bars that he is willing to put into his lunchbox. He now takes three protein bars along with the fig bar and the gummies, and this was only after a months-long fight where I was almost in tears just begging him to put *any* fucking sustenance into his body. \n\nAnd to be clear, he is in excellent shape. He is thin and muscular, he's never been overweight, but he's also never been unhealthily skinny - I don't think it's any sort of eating disorder, which I definitely considered.

Especially since an athlete will almost certainly have different caloric/nutritional needs than the rest of the household, he almost certainly knows what sort of food he needs, and because those needs will be different from the rest of the house, it's not unreasonable to expect him to take some responsibility to ensure those needs are met.\n\nAt 15 I was expected to pack my lunch. It wasn't a responsibility foisted upon me, it was just expected that, at that age, if I didn't like what my mom packed I could deal with it myself. So, during high school, she didn't pack my lunches. If I wanted a certain type of sandwich that required some prep (like a chicken salad sandwich), I could make it myself. If I wanted something I didn't know how to make, my mom would teach me. Ditto for breakfast, if I wasn't up when my dad made breakfast, well, it was up to me to fend for myself if I was hungry.

No, spoiled son doesn't get more allowance than his sisters because he *chooses* to waste his allowance on special treat food at school instead of bringing food from home.

I don't even like to talk that early, I need a time to start my engines at mornings.", "you cleary have no idea about the caloric needs of a male teenage swimmer.. plus the need to stay focused for 8 hours of education on top of that", "People are like \u201cbagels aren\u2019t healthy\u201d and I\u2019m just\u2026ok I know for a fact not every single one of you had parents with a roost of chickens in the back that made their own bread, most of you For fucking sure ate bagels and peanut butter and processed lunch meat, chill please", "Yeah, pop tarts, cereal, protein bars, and frozen breakfast bowls, which with fairly small portions, have *outrageous* amounts of saturated fats and sodium. \n\nNo bueno. What if you helped him make overnight oats and looked up stuff you can add that would be good for his growing body? I\u2019m sure you can add some form of protein and make it delicious. Most of what was listed doesn\u2019t sound that great.", "I think OP only buys pre-boiled eggs.  In OP\u2019s replies, OP says they have boiled eggs because they make salads.", "Are you seriously suggesting that a 15-year-old is unable to realize that you must put food in a bag and take it with you if you want to have a meal at a future time?", "I could never manage both morning and afternoon. It would have transformed my performance but I lived too far from school to get there for 6am without really impacting my sleep. I still remember though how hungry I was in the evening and how often other morning swimmers \u201ccrashed\u201d later in the morning. We know a lot more about nutrition nowadays. If that\u2019s the case \u2014 wanting him to quit \u2014 it is disgusting to project/penalize your kid with food.", "Didn't Michael Phelps also regularly eat over 10,000 calories everyday when training for the Olympics?", "My teenage son is a swimmer- he quit club swim this year, but last summer he swam 6 hours a day. One night he literally ate over 3/4 of a chicken and rice casserole.\n\nETA- for quite a while he had 1st dinner & 2nd dinner \ud83e\udd23", "Seriously. I was a 115 lb girl at 15 and was packing away a good 3000-4000 calories a day, and it was still a fight to keep weight on.\n\nThere's a reason so many swimmers get chubby when we quit the sport, lol. Turns out scarfing down 4000 carb-heavy calories isn't how normal people eat, who knew?", "Why do people keep assuming the kid is eating a healthy breakfast at school? The breakfast at my school is pre-made waffles or pancakes, bad sausage patties and fruit most days. It's certainly no healthier than a couple hard-boiled eggs, peanut-butter and jelly sandwich, Greek yogurt and granola or many other things the kid could throw together the night before.", "I just commented how much my 13 almost 14 yo boys eat. Our grocery bill is astronomical! Like 3k-3500/month and every bit of it gets eaten. Teen boys eat a ton without being in a physical sport!", "Exactly a banana is not going to fuel a 15 year old athlete! He needs protein and complex carbs. And he needs to be taught what that looks like and how to prepare it. OP does not seem to even like her kids.", "Peanut or PBJ or almond butter sandwiches, fig Newtons, cheese and salami w crackers, peanut butter or cheese w apple slices, trail mix, raw nuts... Etc etc", "Does it specify mom vs dad somewhere (maybe I missed it) or are you making an assumption?", "Already going into it thinking it ain't going to work. How about you(op) teach him how to make it work.", "And peanut butter, yoghurt, meat....Why is this so hard for OP to figure out. Something isn't right here.", "Dads divorced for a reason", "Yeah he needs way more than some fruit.", "What I am missing in that list of things OP posted as options is a self made sandwich. Is that not a thing where he lives to take some bread and put something in between?", "My mom was a poor single mom and she would give every last dime she had to make sure our accounts were full to eat as much as we needed or wanted. I can\u2019t imagine this poor boy using his spending money to feed himself. Hurts my heart.", "Sure, those are great options to offer him! The point is that \"just telling him to put fruit in a bag\" is a deliberate abdication of her actual responsibility to make sure her child is sufficiently fueled for athletics.", "Damn. I'm really sorry. That's outrageous! When they start needing you to take care of THEM you should do exactly the same thing. Present them with a weekly bill.", "Wow that's a pretty nasty way to be raised. Hope yr life is wonderful now; you deserve it.", "Omg.  My eldest is 11... When she turns 12 we are going to give her her own bank card and change her weekly pocket money from $12 a week to $100 a month paid on the first.  The idea that she'll have to use that for outings and clothes and her own stuff.  \n\nBut we're still buying shoes, socks and undies, toiletries, food, family outings, school stuff, all the basics.  It's supposed to teach her budgeting, independence and be a bit fun.  If she had to buy everything she needs then I'm not parenting anymore, I'm offloading it to her, even if I'm funding it.", "Get a Costco and Sam's membership \ud83e\udd23", "Pack more food from home. It's not hard", "Exactly! Allowance is not for basics you are supposed to provide as a parent.", "15 is only old enough for the kid to be able to do those things if he has been properly raised and taught how to do those things. And given that his parent is not able to, it's safe to say he isnt. \n\nChildren are still learning how to human. We cannot expect them to magically come from the factory with all the custom software installed. We have to do that coding. \n\nIn My childhood, I was never shown how to do simple things like cleaning the shower, shaving my legs, and definitely food planning/prep and troubleshooting why I was struggling in a situation/routine. I arrived at adulthood without these skills. I spent about 10 years banging my head against walls, incredibly frustrated and discouraged and mad at myself for being incapable of managing the seemingly most simple tasks. I dated people who also thought i was a failure, because it didnt seem like a red flag because i also believed that was true, which reenforced the blame and deterioration. This process removed all of my self confidence and self regulation ability, and drove me right up to the brink of suicide before I managed to fall in with some people who supported me and helped me learn things instead of hating me for not knowing them. I consider myself to be somewhere in years 1-3 of learning how to actually effectively take care of myself and my environment. It's a long process because I can't just install new software/knowledge, first I have to uninstall the bad programming and then debug for all the mental viruses that have been introduced. \n\nParents are responsible for their children. If children are not succeeding, their parents need to be held responsible first, THEN if the parenting process is found to be sufficient or appropriate then the child should be held responsible.", "ugh--this is heartbreaking. \n\nOP seems more negligent than abusive--at least I hope so but I hope her ex is on top of things in the household since something isn't right there. Maybe OP should let the son live with his dad."]}
