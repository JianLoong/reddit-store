You are wasting people time.\n\nYta", "YTA. For multiple reasons, but one part of your attitude in particular stood out to me:\n\n>My son is learning more in college than anything in her class and she should be supportive of that.\n\nuhm... nope.\n\nYou're talking English, not math or science. If you were talking those, I might think you had a point. But with English, naw you don't. And I say that as someone who was not enthused about my HS English classes (note, all of which were tbe advanced claases for college track students) and only enjoyed my college classes more because I had control of the classes I took.\n\nAlmost without a doubt, between the CC and HS English classes, the operative comparision is not \"more\", it is \"different\". As in the areas of English they are focusing on are different.\n\nEnglish is not something where what you study has a fairly linear progression that is reasonanly consistent across ciricula. Not like taking a calculus class in both programs, where the exact same material would be getting covered.\n\nEnglish is a wide open buffet. The HS English class mighg be looking at literature topics like Elizabeth Barrett Browing, Faulkner, or Pilgrim's Progress. Where the CC class might be focusing on composition. Or vice versa.\n\nYour son could very well be learning two very different aspects of English in those classes. But he's not, because he's not bothering to try.\n\nAnd that statement. I sure hope you didn't actually say it to his HS English teacher or the VP. Because, if you did, I can guarantee that what they heard was \"You suck and you shouldn't complain.\"\n\nAlso, another point of your bad attitude. Your mention of how the grades would interact. You're clearly overlooking some aspects of it. That CC class may be harder than the HS one. Sure, if he passes, it will give credit and cover the requirement. But what if he bombs the class? Right now, by skipping the HS class, he's essentially forgoing the chance to keep it as backup. And what if he does just ok? Like a C. That will drag doen his HS GPA. Can't use the HS class to fix that if he's not there.\n\nIf this were late May and he was sitting there with an A in the CC class, he'd have justification for skipping tge HS class. Considering it's mid February? Dumb. Just Dumb.", "YTA, I\u2019ll be surprised if your kid accomplishes much of anything with the attitude you\u2019re teaching him. I was in a similar situation my senior year. I dropped the class, picked up another that wasn\u2019t redundant. Simple fix. If he can\u2019t drop the class, then he\u2019s just going to have to suck it up. He might not even pass the college class, despite you feeling it isn\u2019t possible that he won\u2019t.", "YTA\n\nYou're kinda setting him up to have a sense of entitlement. He may look at some classes and think \"I'm averaging an A. I can blow it off today\".

The rule is that he must go to high school and it starts at a certain time. We don't get to engineer our own approach here. At least, not until he's OUT of high school. There aren't shortcuts and it seems like you're advocating for just that. \n\nIt seems like you have a great kid who is very hard working and studious. I hope he doesn't develop a resentment for rules and structure, because that will not benefit him later in life. Peak efficiency isn't the goal in life sometimes. No one wins harder because they graduated a little earlier. It's just... graduation.\n\nI think the approach you are taking is cavalier and the school has every right to be upset about it.

Nothing wrong with just going with the flow and not being hyper-competitive but even the least competitive universities (for pre-med and then med school) are going to be a lot more competitive than high school or community college. If he doesn\u2019t have the discipline to slog through the tedium now and will willingly cut corners while being an average performer\u2026that doesn\u2019t seem like a good set up for his future schooling and life in general. OP is also assuming a risk here, because the kid\u2019s high school diploma presumably depends on passing all his classes. He would pass high school English if he gets at least a B for the college credits for English. But what if he doesn\u2019t?\n\nOP is also the TA for how they responded to the VP \u2014 with sarcasm (what is he going to do? Put my almost 17yo in foster care?) and with dismissiveness to the teacher (I don\u2019t care about her).

OP also mentions in a comment that they think high school diplomas are worthless (or something like that, and probably why they don\u2019t respect the school or it\u2019s authorities) but the fact remains that the kid is going to need to pass high school to enter university. OP is encouraging the kid\u2019s dream of becoming a doctor without tempering it with the requirements needed to get to that dream.

It\u2019s a bit unusual for a HS student to just be taking classes at a community college unless they are dual credit courses that are providing grades that go towards the HS diploma and count for college credit.

Having worked in higher education for several years, I can confidently say high school students coming in with significant community college credits had the worst schedules their first couple of semesters.  Sure, they'd knocked out some general eds, but often had to take a similar class over because the class was a prerequisite for an upper level one, and it's not unusual for schools to disallow transfer credits be used as prereqs.  Or, for example, if he took an Into to Chemistry course + lab in community college, but the university he wants to transfer it to says it wasn't rigorous enough, he'd have to retake the equivalent lecture and lab, things like that.Additionally, community college credits can usually only be used for freshman and sophomore level courses, so if you overload on those prior to even starting at a 4 year school, you aren't going to save as much time as you think.  It's ultimately up to the college how they want to accept those transfer credits and most limit the number allowed from a CC, so student's piling up transfer credits weren't always doing themselves a favor.", "School is work you do to get something useful out of it.
