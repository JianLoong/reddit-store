{"id": 27810, "submission_id": "16uj0se", "title": "AITA for pushing my wife to leave on time everyday?", "selftext": "My wife and I have been together for 12 years and ever since I met her she's had a tentative grip on time management. This has always been a bit of a pain point in our relationship as I really value punctuality. Through many discussions and fights over the years we have largely decided to leave the topic alone, and to do our best to be understanding of each other's perspectives. That doesn't mean that she does any better being punctual though. This has always irked me a bit as I think it's disrespectful and rude to be late, but I don't want constant conflict with my wife so I do my best to not bring it up.\n\nI am getting ready to start work again, after being away for a year to support our little ones abroad while my wife completed her master's degree. While my work offers some flexibility with the start time, I need to start before 8am. Leading up to my first day I've wanted to practice getting the kids to daycare at a time that allows me to make it to work before 8am. So I set my expectations that we need to leave by 7:10am - I told the kids this and my wife this, and there was no protest. My kids are adjusting fine to this change, they're tired and little grumpy but they go along with it. But my wife on the other hand has fought this at every step. Every morning it seems that there is some excuse, \"you didn't give me a five minute warning,\" \" it's not that important since you're not working yet,\" I needed to shower\". While she is usually only about 15-20 minutes late, it is enough that I hit worse traffic and am unable to make it to work in time. I do everything I can to expedite things in the morning: waking up, feeding, and dressing the kids. But she still can't get herself ready in time to leave.\n\nI find this extremely frustrating and disrespectful. Sure I'm not back at work for a few days, but I really wanted to get this routine down before I need to do it for real. I'm anxious about starting work again and this has only added to my anxiety. I remind my wife, sometimes fairly assertively, most mornings about the 7:10 drop dead time being important to me and how I find it disrespectful that she isn't ready by then. This usually leads to an argument and hard feelings.\n\nI don't feel that I should give in on this though. I think she is being narcissistic by not supporting me with this, and I think she is wrong. While I don't want to argue with her, I need her to help me out so I can be on time.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit 1: my wife needs to be ready for 7:10 because she sometimes rides along with us in the morning. Even if she isn't riding along she likes to help get the kids ready in the morning, and the kids demand to see her in the morning. She doesn't respect the 7:10 departure time when she is helping though.\n\nEdit 2: we have a good, healthy relationship. We are both good communicators and try to respect each other's unique perspectives... this specific issue seems to bring out the worst in both of us though", "created_utc": 1695914847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16uj0se/aita_for_pushing_my_wife_to_leave_on_time_everyday/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Next time, warn her that you'll be leaving without her when she wakes up and tell her the time 5 minutes before leaving. If she's not ready on time, you leave. And you do it every morning.\n\nIncidentally, your wife may suffer from ADHD. It's a possibility she can consider if she wants to be diagnosed someday.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Turn the tables. Let it be her responsibility to get the kids ready and drop them off. Since she doesn't care about punctuality then she shouldn't  mind making herself late for work.", "Info: why does she need to be ready at 7:10; are you all riding together?", "NTA. She\u2019s being very inconsiderate. The hard truth is; you might have to leave without her a time or two to drive this point home. I understand and agree with not usually nagging her, but her tardiness is directly affecting you now and you can\u2019t keep quiet about it.", "INFO: Why does she need to be ready at this time too? You're dropping the kids off at daycare, why does your wife need to get ready too?", "Why does you having to be at work have to deal with whether she needs to be ready at a specific time?", "ESH. This is obviously very important to you and so your wife should be willing to support you, but it sounds like you also already had a feeling this was going to be a disaster. Stop hounding her. She's an adult. You know you need to leave at 7:10. Leave at 7:10. If she's not ready to leave with you, she gets left behind. If the kids aren't ready to leave with you, they get left behind with her. She's an adult and she will figure it out. If she doesn't like having to figure it out, she will start getting up earlier and helping you get your kids ready.", "NTA\n\nPoor Punctuality and bad time keeping are my bug bare as well.

Leave at 7:10 with or without her.", "Sounds to me like there may be an executive function issue here. That\u2019s my bias though as my ex-wife has ADHD and I used to deal with this all the time, and yeah, it was always a fight. Has that ever been looked at? If that\u2019s the issue, try to have some compassion, but also understand that you still have to figure out how to be on time. Perhaps you just go without her. NTA", "NTA. omgosh. Some people separate because of their problems with time management. Your wife doesn't need your support. She needs to behave like an adult professional. She can shower the night before. She can set an alarm clock. She can pack lunches and even iron her clothes well before each day when the sun rises. Good grief. Adulting is not so hard that anyone need make every moment of every day all about them.\n\nI don't see this as disrespectful so much as I find it self involved to the point of absurdity. It feels hostile and intentional to everyone who has to put up with it.    \n\nCan she car pool with anyone who isn't you and the kids? The idea of being late to work gives me huge anxiety. I can't navigate that every day. Its too stressful. Can you invest in a decent used car that your wife can take herself to work in?

It is important to you because you are the one that ends up being late and flustered.\n\nSo, start leaving on time and leave her behind. Tell her- I need to leave at 7:10, I will be leaving at that time, and I\u2019ll let you know I\u2019m leaving but I won\u2019t be waiting anymore. And then you have to do that- get ready, get the kids ready, at 7:05 or whenever you are in the final paces of leaving, let her know you are ready to go and will be leaving.\n\nThe hardest part is not participating in the negotiation or fight when she asks for more time. You need to remain calm and simply say- no, I have to leave at X time and cannot wait, so I\u2019m still leaving, and then leave.", "NTA.

She clearly doesn't respect the change and is resistant to it which just makes it worse.  Like another poster said, you should be prepping everything the night before, that's definitely what my mom did because she was a single parent.  Maybe just wake her up to say goodbye?  Its been 12 years, this is just part of who she is, might just be better to accept that and work around it to avoid unnecessary strife.", "NTA. She keeps making excuses because she won't accept responsibility for her inability to be ready on time. I'd issue an ultimatum. \"If you're not ready by 7:10, we're leaving without you and you have to get to work another way.\" You keep trying to make her do the right thing, but either she simply can't do it, or she won't. If she's chronically late to everything--work, appointments, social engagements--then her core problem is that she values her own time more than anyone else's.", "NTA\n\nIn a relationship with kids, pull two people have to pull together as adults in all areas \n\nThe fact that she\u2019s a great cook or that she\u2019s really interested in the kids education or something else doesn\u2019t compensate for this sort of daily nonstop inconsideration \n\nShe is entirely in the wrong", "She probably has ADD.", "Stop letting her ride a long with you\n\nI\u2019m going ESH because she\u2019s been late for 12 years and she\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s not going to change. \n\nI think people who are chronically late are incredibly rude.

She's a grown woman who should be able to get herself places on time. What is she teaching her children? That you can just be late whenever and that the world will wait for you? That's a great way to do badly in school and never hold down a job. \n\nHonestly, I'd just quit involving her. No ride alongs, and you get the kids ready in the morning. If she's awake, fine, but this is your rodeo and work schedule, so you need to cut her out of it. She will absolutely not change once your job starts.", "More info: Is this really about your wife\u2019s time management or do you resent doing more for the kids in the morning than she does when she\u2019s not ready on time? If you\u2019re willing and able to get the kids up & out the door yourself, just do it. If she misses the time with the kids, she\u2019ll make herself available.

Stop that unless she is ready on time, otherwise leave.  You get up early and get the kids ready.  The kids can say goodbye to her in the 5 minutes before you leave.

You need a daily routine that isn't dependent on your wife waking up a particular time.", "NTA. But as someone who is also late all the time, I don't think talking about is is gonna help.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who are chronically late are the types who fundamentally don't care about other people's time or overall needs.

Do you know that some people don\u2019t have internal clocks? Especially if they suffer from ADHD. Granted, that is difficult to live with, but getting angry about it isn\u2019t going to help. Change the system. Leave without her. Set her alarm for earlier. Make her apple watch ding every ten minutes in the morning so she stays on schedule. Whatever. There are plenty of options. It sucks that a grown woman is putting you in this position, but if you value your relationship and home life, it is up to you to better engineer the system. that\u2019s the sad truth of it.", "YTA - Not for your expectations but how soon you want to see them, these setbacks are your wife getting used to the new schedule you proposed.

Some are just wired this way. I use to get to work early by up to 30 minutes, the same for appointments. My father was always late if he ever showed up so I am like you. My train of thought it better one is inconvenienced over the many.

This makes estimating how long tasks will take very difficult, including commuting times, prep times, etc. My son (9) who inherited my ADHD and has it even more severely, cannot even differentiate between days and weeks. He cannot estimate time at all. Time is a complete abstract mystery to him.
