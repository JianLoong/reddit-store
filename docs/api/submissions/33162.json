Never new babies could be so violent till she was born", "Your sister will have to build up the time she's away from her child until she can be gone for days at a time. It will be incredibly traumatic for everyone if she is gone for days when the baby can't be away from her for 30 minutes.", "Well she won\u2019t be there so she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s her problem. Super curious if she is prepared to pay op anything meaningful.", "Your sister cannot afford your rate. Period. Even if you haven\u2019t set it yet. For a child still in diapers, 24 hrs for multiple days\u2026 NOPE that\u2019s $1500+ Sorry, not sorry. \n\nYour child is sleeping? I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m on the clock which means you\u2019re paying.", "If anyone uses the kid card to manipulate you or make you look bad you can say, \u2018gee, I\u2019d love to start my own family but I\u2019m always covering for you\u2019.  Obviously you are not obligated to have children after that. You can claim your sock puppets are your children and they can say literally nothing about it. Or you could be a Viking and say I don\u2019t want to cover for you.", "I don\u2019t know anyone who would do this to me but I would totally call the cops as it would be fucking psychotic to leave a child in diapers with me.", "There's been plenty of posts on reddit about people pulling that kind of shit so i would let her know now, you aren't going to be played.", "If you think she is the type, warn her what will happen if she tries it.", "She said from morning until the paternal grandmother leaves work for the day. Last I checked that\u2019s typically only 6-8hrs. Not days.", "AND???  He doesn\u2019t have to do all or nothing, but doing nothing makes him an asshole.  but like I said, probably for the best because it sounds like he would just abuse the kid.", "Lol. I have three plus did daycare for 12. I get it!  Don\u2019t let her guilt you. Babies have all these feelings they don\u2019t understand or know how to deal with. I can understand her needing a break snd you not wanting to watch her.  Hopefully she can find someone for the day time.", "Exactly, yes. \nYou said what I wanted to say with the line that she hasn't been prepared for longer sleepovers. \n\nWhere I'm from, even daycare does build up in time in the first week or two. You leave an hour. Repeat for a few days. Then maybe 2 hours. Until the child is familiar with the adults, the daycare. Etc and can stay longer. \nYou can't just sign them up and drop them off for hours on day 1.", "The girl is a crawler lol. Despite being tiny, she is very fast. Plus, they don\u2019t live at the house, visiting at least once every two months, so there\u2019s no point in baby proofing. Yes, we ensure the place is safe when the do visit, but she somehow manages to be a little too curious", "*She, and you\u2019re right. I do watch them occasionally. School breaks, I pick them up from school when they\u2019re sick, and take one to practice every sports season. That\u2019s not mentioning the few hours I watch them depending on the time my parents get off work. I just don\u2019t leech of my mom and stepdad, I also do the house chores and the occasional grocery shopping during. Plus, I make dinner during the times my stepdad gets off of work late. My older siblings were allowed this luxury, college after school and everything else is taken care of.", "What percentage of American college students are having their education financed by their parents?\n\nThe majority are financing their educations themselves using student loans.", "to me, this is the info Reddit needed, \n\nThe child in not a new born, but an active human.\n\nA toddler will ALWAYS get into trouble unless there is a person watching what  the toddler does or there is play pen.\n\nIf I came across as harsh I apologize,  Babysitting this your person is NOT responsibility.  Watching them their crib, Feedin and changing their diaper is ok. This involves dealing with a toddler,", "Few toddlers are still crawling.", "why doesnt OP give us more information about the age of the child?", "Ah, I just saw a comment above from OP that the baby is a fast crawler, so probably somewhere between about 9 and, oh, 15 months old, maybe?", "Good question, as \"still in diapers\" can be anywhere from just born to even four years old in a child with no major developmental delays. But \"baby\" implies not walking yet (learning to walk is what makes a toddler a toddler)."]}
