My husband and I have been butting heads about cleaning.\n\nI have bad indoor allergies and take antihistamines year-round. My husband doesn\u2019t have allergies. When we bought this house last year, we got a robot vacuum that also mops. I have a hard time using his upright vac, which he insisted we keep over my stick vac when we combined households years ago. His vacuum is heavy and doesn\u2019t turn easily, so I tend to roll it over my feet or pull muscles in my back (I\u2019m weak AF). I prefer to run the robot vac, and with our perfect dumdum baby of a longhaired cat, I try to run it a couple times a week.\n\nMy husband complains that this is overkill and I\u2019m a perfectionist when it comes to the house. I\u2019m not a stellar housekeeper by any stretch, but I like things to be functionally clean and not to smell. My husband shares other chores with me like loading the dishwasher, laundry, trash, but not cleaning. He would tell you he cleans the toilet - I would tell you he only swipes the bowl, no cleaner, and does it so incompetently that I have to clean the whole thing after so the bathroom doesn\u2019t stink of urine.\n\nA couple days ago, I woke up to a mess. My husband had diarrhea during the night but didn\u2019t quite make it: shit on the toilet seat, the trashcan, the floor, down the side of the tub. It\u2019s a tiny bathroom so this is all within a small radius. I asked him to clean when he woke up. He got most of what I saw, but I had to finish the job.\n\nOr so I thought. I couldn\u2019t figure out where the smell was still coming from the next day until I spotted it in the bathmat. My husband loves his bathmat, insists it\u2019s superior because wooden. It has a crosshatch pattern with little square holes between the wood pieces. His shit is stuck in these holes and the crevices. He rinsed it and left it in the tub, where little brown pools of water dry under it.\n\nI ask him to clean the tub, which he does begrudgingly. I notice the bathmat is still shitty. He says, \u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d I say I\u2019d love not to step out of the shower onto shit. He half-asses the job. Several holes still closed with dried shit. Today I ask him to clean it again and he agrees, but all day goes by and it doesn\u2019t happen, so I ask again. He doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019s leaving town in a couple days for a month or two, so I say I\u2019ll put the bathmat outside and use a towel on the floor until he gets back if he doesn\u2019t get all the shit off before he leaves. He objects to this treatment of his beloved bathmat.\n\nHe says he\u2019s already cleaned it enough and I\u2019m being my perfectionist asshole self because I have too high a standard for \u201cclean.\u201d I think this is a reasonable ask.

Your choice, pal. If he loves his bathmat (and you!) that much, he'll clean it. You're not asking too much.\n\nI'd be reevaluating my relationship with him at this point, but assuming you do love him and want to stay with him...\n\nYou seem be regularly butting heads with him over the cleaning. If your household finances permit it, have you considered getting a cleaner once or twice a week?\n\nIt won't solve serious issues like diarrhea on the bathmat (I'd object to dealing with that, if I were your cleaner!), but it may at least help cut down the amount of time you spend arguing about cleaning. It's not always the big furious fights that damage a relationship. It can be the day to day friction. It grinds away and grinds away, and it can turn one of you into a nag and the other into a resentful child. If it's possible to outsource the cleaning, that may help you reduce a lot of the friction in your relationship.", "NTA. Oh my lord, what did I just read? That is gross. I would throw them both away\u2026 seriously tho, throw the mat away. There is no cleanse deep enough to sort that out. \n\nIdk if I\u2019m really petty but I would give him a taste of his own medicine.

A couple of times a week is so not overkill.", "I can\u2019t get over the fact that he didn\u2019t make the toilet, got shit all over the bathroom and just went back to bed.

Thought majority of our bottoms cover the toilet seat hole.\n\nAnyhow wanting a bio hazard gone is not being a perfectionist.
