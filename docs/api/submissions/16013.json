I'd consider us \"work friends\" (i.e. we take lunch breaks together sometimes but don't hang out outside of work).\n\nLast week I took the day off, and this is something that's pretty public at work. My job is set up in shifts, and schedules are posted to everyone via an app so we can swap/change days if necessary. This was also something communicated to Beth, but I can admit it was conversationally (i.e. \"I finally got tickets to go to Disneyland on Friday) and not directly (i.e. I can't take you to work on Friday because I'm going to Disneyland). \n\nI assumed she knew that we wouldn't be carpooling because she took a day off three weeks back and although she didn't say anything directly to me, I went to work by myself and she didn't tell me anything extra. \n\nThe issue is that when I came back from my trip, my boss called me into her office and asked me about Beth and what happened the day I took off. Apparently she didn't come to work, and a no-call/no-show is pretty serious at work and can lead to termination. Beth blamed me and said that I bailed on her and she wasn't able to get a ride to work. \n\nI explained that we carpool, yes, but I took an official day off. Even if I didn't explicitly tell Beth, she sees the schedule weekly. Plus, Beth did know that I had the day off because we talked about my plans for the trip just the day before I left. \n\nBeth is getting in trouble at work now, and she's been telling everyone that I'm the AH for getting her in trouble. I feel bad because technically I didn't directly say \"I cannot take you to work\", but I also feel like it was obvious (and she herself did the same thing to me before and I got to work fine). I'm not sure if I should apologize or not though because it's causing some drama amongst my coworkers.", "created_utc": 1682803493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13375u8/aita_for_not_carpooling_on_my_day_off_and_getting/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not let her drag you down with her.", "NTA it is not that she was a no show she was also a no call, no pickup.  She took a long weekend unscheduled and is now blaming you for getting in trouble.  There are a lot of ways to get to work, rideshare, taxi, bus, bike, walk.   Time to end the carpool and leave her on her own.", "So, when you didn\u2019t pick her up that morning she didn\u2019t even try and contact you to find out where you were, and she didn\u2019t answer any calls from her boss. \n\nYeah, she knew you\u2019d taken the day off, she just figured she\u2019d have one too and that she\u2019d get away with the no call no show for once since she could blame you. \n\nIf your boss brings it up again, say that. And don\u2019t feel bad if that gets her into trouble, even if she loses her job over it. Because clearly she was happy to throw you under the bus. That doesn\u2019t earn any loyalty.", "It sounds like she took advantage of an opportunity to skip work and use you as an excuse.  She didn\u2019t think that one through.  NTA", "Grown adults are responsible for getting themselves to work. The fact that she didn't even call in shows who's really at fault.", "NTA. She has a car, and could have driven herself to work.", "NTA she's an adult who can figure it out and it's extremely unprofessional for your boss to get you involved in her no call no show", "Nta but I'm confused... does she have a car?", "NTA. No, you should NOT have explicitly stated that you wouldn't be driving her to work!!! You spoke with her about your plans. So what did she think you were going to do, drive her on your day off? That's ridiculous. She's a grown ass woman and she had plenty of time to make her own arrangements. She must have had a way of getting to work before the carpooling arrangement, right? She can do that again. Regardless of the arrangement, it is ultimately her responsibility to get her own self to work, unless you maliciously do something to prevent that from happening, which you didn't. Unless she's flat out stupid, she should have taken \"I'm going on a trip\" to mean that you would not be driving her that day, and if there was any confusion, then she could have asked.\n\nI'm confused about one thing. How do you take turns driving if she doesn't have her own car and needs a ride when you're unavailable? Do you take turns driving *your* car? Sounds like she may be starting to feel entitled to your vehicle. I'd nip that shit in the bud real quick", "INFO - How does she share the driving responsibility when carpooling, but suddenly had no capable way of getting to work when you didn\u2019t show up?", "NTA and do not fucking apologize", "NTA- I'm just confused since you both drive. Like hows your day off even affect her ability to drive herself  or obtain another mean.", "NTA and if Beth gets fired for her dumb decisions, you won\u2019t have to deal with the awkwardness you otherwise would have had to deal with by refusing to drive her anymore.", "Why would she have to Uber?\n\nThey take turns driving. I\u2019m assuming that means that Beth sometimes picks OP up as well, and actually has her own vehicle.", "She shouldn\u2019t need a different mode of transportation. Based on OP\u2019s post saying they take turns driving, it sounds like Beth has a car.", "You say you take turns driving. So sometimes she picks you up, yes?\n\nSo she has her own car, right?", "If she expected a ride from you, wouldn\u2019t she have called when you didn\u2019t show up?", "Listen OP, your co-worker is an adult woman, NOT a child. Actions have consequences. She KNEW you had a day off and most likely wouldn\u2019t be driving her to work! You talked to her the day before you had a day off about your plans and this was the perfect time and opportunity for Beth to ask if you were still driving her to work or if she should find another way.\n\nDo not feel bad or sorry for Beth\u2019s actions and lack of planning. She had a day off 3 weeks ago, NEVER told you about it, you KNEW by checking and looking at the schedule and planned accordingly like normal adults do. This is on Beth. NOT you. Do not do more carpooling with Beth because she doesn\u2019t respect you.", "Just curious\u2026 did you carpool after the weekend? Like the day you got called to the boss\u2019 office? Did she say anything to you?? Have you carpooled since?\n\nNTA"]}
