I'd consider us \"work friends\" (i.e. we take lunch breaks together sometimes but don't hang out outside of work).\n\nLast week I took the day off, and this is something that's pretty public at work. My job is set up in shifts, and schedules are posted to everyone via an app so we can swap/change days if necessary. This was also something communicated to Beth, but I can admit it was conversationally (i.e. \"I finally got tickets to go to Disneyland on Friday) and not directly (i.e. I can't take you to work on Friday because I'm going to Disneyland). \n\nI assumed she knew that we wouldn't be carpooling because she took a day off three weeks back and although she didn't say anything directly to me, I went to work by myself and she didn't tell me anything extra. \n\nThe issue is that when I came back from my trip, my boss called me into her office and asked me about Beth and what happened the day I took off. Apparently she didn't come to work, and a no-call/no-show is pretty serious at work and can lead to termination. Beth blamed me and said that I bailed on her and she wasn't able to get a ride to work. \n\nI explained that we carpool, yes, but I took an official day off. Even if I didn't explicitly tell Beth, she sees the schedule weekly. Plus, Beth did know that I had the day off because we talked about my plans for the trip just the day before I left. \n\nBeth is getting in trouble at work now, and she's been telling everyone that I'm the AH for getting her in trouble. I feel bad because technically I didn't directly say \"I cannot take you to work\", but I also feel like it was obvious (and she herself did the same thing to me before and I got to work fine). I'm not sure if I should apologize or not though because it's causing some drama amongst my coworkers.", "created_utc": 1682803493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13375u8/aita_for_not_carpooling_on_my_day_off_and_getting/", "score": 1020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
