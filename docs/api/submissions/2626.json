I am supposed to drive three hours with 85 year old father, niece and her mom to pick up dead brothers stuff and ashes. I realized at 1 am last night that I really don\u2019t want to. Brother never cared about anyone other than himself. The 85 year old dad is rude and cranky. Made the realization last night that the old man won\u2019t call me unless there\u2019s a problem with his phone. Has no interest me, my family or life so I decided last night, fuck it. I\u2019m not going. It\u2019s ok to walk from toxic shit right? I don\u2019t owe anybody anything.  Idk. Just a rant. But then again I feel guilty not going.
