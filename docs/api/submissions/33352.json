We agreed to have another team meeting in a month or so to decide, but there was no deadline or date set for the meeting. The decision itself wasn't a decision that would make or break the business... Giving it an extra few weeks while my body finished miscarrying and I could get into a better headspace mentally would not have made or broken the business. If you're not familiar with miscarriages, it can take around 2 weeks for your body to pass it naturally. There is bleeding, cramping, back pain and fatigue involved. If you can't pass it naturally you need to take medications and/or undergo procedures to make sure everything that should be gone is gone, or it can be life threatening. Physically it's hard, but emotionally it's painful as well. Sorry if this is TMI, but I don't think it's talked about enough and as a result people who haven't gone through it don't get it. For me this was my second miscarriage in a 6 month period. I was really excited about this one and because I was further along I was sure everything was going to work out. It had been 7 days since I had started bleeding, cramping and experiencing intense back pain when my sister texted me to make that decision... I was still bleeding and cramping and felt shitty. She knew all this...\n\nYes, a coin toss does seem flippant, but what can I say. It's a family business... There's no HR or policy for when your sister decides to bully her 78 year old mom/the business owner into a promotion/raise behind everyone's back, 3/4 employees disagree with this and you all try to figure out a fair way to move forward. My sister and I basically have the same credentials (She has a masters, I have a doctorate. Both our respective business sectors that we run do equally as well.
