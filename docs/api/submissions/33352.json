The decision itself wasn't a decision that would make or break the business... Giving it an extra few weeks while my body finished miscarrying and I could get into a better headspace mentally would not have made or broken the business. If you're not familiar with miscarriages, it can take around 2 weeks for your body to pass it naturally. There is bleeding, cramping, back pain and fatigue involved. If you can't pass it naturally you need to take medications and/or undergo procedures to make sure everything that should be gone is gone, or it can be life threatening. Physically it's hard, but emotionally it's painful as well. Sorry if this is TMI, but I don't think it's talked about enough and as a result people who haven't gone through it don't get it. For me this was my second miscarriage in a 6 month period. I was really excited about this one and because I was further along I was sure everything was going to work out.

I don't believe any few therapy sessions would help. \n\nI don't know what planet Mom and Sister live on where being just evil to a woman going through a miscarriage is remotely normal, but I also don't get why this easy, fruitful job is worth dealing with either of them. I'd live in a hovel on food stamps (yes, seriously) before I'd put up with this bullshit. OP is not going to outlast Amy's evil. No one could. \n\nWhere are OP's people? Since they're obviously not Mom, Amy or Brother, where's OP's husband? Her friends?", "Until she changed it later without you guys there.", "Ok but then why not just object immediately? Why did OP need so much time to say no?", "The nurse sister already quit her job a month before. Waiting just meant continuing the full-time family job a bit longer u til deciding who would permanently have that job.", "As a nurse myself, her sister sounds like she\u2019d be crappy to patients and coworkers. And more nurses doesn\u2019t fix the shortage if they are shitty nurses. Part of the crisis is created by hospital and other healthcare settings dumping unreasonable and unsafe workloads onto nurses, many states pay is crap for a job that needs a degree and license. Patient and visitor violence is increasing and nurses aren\u2019t supported to file charges of assault, which is their legal right. Hospital systems only care about profit over patients and good experienced nurses are leaving direct patient care for other specialties or quitting altogether. That means newer nurses or traveling nurses filling the gaps. Travel nurses are hit or miss. Some are awesome and some really are only in it for the paycheck. The great panini also didn\u2019t help things.", "T-shirt and wear it to Christmas", "tshirt with boat and pile of cats all on one side??? so it's tipping?", "Wow. Imagine all the employees that are going to get pregnant and then self-harm so they can get time off. /s", "Does Amy think women deliberately miscarry to get time off? I wonder what her thought process is on this.", "If only every victim of narcissistic AHs waved this flag, we could shut down so many terrible people! So sad.", "As I understood what I read, it was supposes to be a family decision, they all wanted that raise. But it was ultimately supposed to come down to a vote. But OP sister went and probably pulled the 'your taking food out of your granddaughters mouth' card and granny chose her to be the one to get the raise, even tho she's the one who tried to steal it in the first place", "With a cute cat on it so everyone looks", "That they would lie.", "Kitten wearing a Santa hat!"]}
