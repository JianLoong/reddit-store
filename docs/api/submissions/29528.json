I spent 9 wonderful years with my husband John and we were happily married for more than 6 of those years. We welcomed our first daughter Ellie (11F) and he was a doting father to her. His death was so unexpected and sudden, as he was only 32 and it broke me and Ellie. It was even sadder because we had found out not long before he died that I was pregnant with Sophie (3F) and he never got to meet her.\n\nI have spent the past 4+ years being on my own. All my attention went to Ellie to help cope with losing her dad and to provide as best a life I could for her and my then unborn child as a single mom. I convinced myself I was content with being fulfilled by motherhood and watching the 2 people I love more than anything grow and be happy but it\u2019s been incredibly lonely. I have missed company and companionship or even just having someone to talk to, so I decided to put myself back out there.\n\nI joined a dating site around 2/3 months ago and I really hit it off with Danny after being on there for a couple of weeks (35M). We have been on several dates and have been talking a lot. I know it\u2019s early days but it honesty feels refreshing just having someone to talk to about my day or about me as I spent so long just forgetting about me for the sake of my kids that it\u2019s nice that someone wants to know me. It\u2019s like I have opened up a part of myself and allowed myself to be happy after so long. I loved my husband very much and I have missed him terribly but I know he\u2019s never coming back. I think 4 years is a long time to spend on your own and I think even I have left it long enough that it\u2019s okay to meet someone else.\n\nI was really excited so I decided to tell my SIL, my late husband\u2019s sister as she is very close to my nieces and helped me a lot when John died. I told her that I have met someone, it is going well, he is very nice, I feel happy around him and that I hope it progresses eventually. She didn\u2019t take the news well and actually got really angry and said that I\u2019m moving on too quickly and that I\u2019m trying to replace John. I got really angry myself and I snapped. I asked her how long she expected me to be on my own? 5 years? 10? Until the kids are grown? I told her I have spent 4 years mourning and that she had some nerve to insinuate my husband\u2019s death meant nothing to me and that I\u2019m going to let some random man enter my children\u2019s lives which isn\u2019t happening at all. He hasn\u2019t met my kids and he isn\u2019t going to any time soon if at all depending on how well things go with us. Plus, I am not looking for someone to replace John or someone to become a dad to my children. I just miss romance that\u2019s all.\n\nI haven\u2019t really spoken to her since as her comments have left me furious. She has sent me messages saying she is sorry I took her words the wrong way but that she is just looking out for me and the kids but I think it\u2019s BS. I have been discussing this with a friend of mine and asked for her opinion. She thinks I have sacrificed a lot over the last few years and I am allowed to move on with my life. She also says my SIL is completely out of line and was deeply insensitive especially since my husband\u2019s death completely broke me and it was like my whole world was taken from me.", "created_utc": 1698100571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ex9ko/aita_for_snapping_at_my_sil_after_she_accused_me/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone grieves differently\u2014but four years seems like a socially appropriate amount of time for you to have put off dating. Maybe your SIL just wasn\u2019t the right person to share your news with\u2026in hindsight.", "NTA - she crossed a line for sure. It\u2019s such a shame she couldn\u2019t be happy for you after all this time. You sound like you had a good relationship before that though so will you be able to forgive her?", "You cannot replace what is irreplaceable. There is no substitute either.\nYou loved him. He loved you. It was magic. That\u2019s wonderful. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you went through.\n\nPeople grieve differently. People process pain and loss in different ways. You\u2019ve had time alone with your thoughts. You\u2019ve had family to help you. You\u2019ve been through hell and you have come out the other side. \n\nAnd guess what? You are entitled to continue living \u2665\ufe0f\n\nIt sounds to me like you\u2019re ready to move forward. (Notice I do not say \u201cmoving on\u201d... Please see my first statement.) Regardless of if it\u2019s this guy or not, when you are ready, you will not be replacing, because this will be completely new and not the same at all. You had a great love. Your next relationship may be a great love as well. Frankly, I don\u2019t like settling for anything less. But it\u2019s not going to be the same. And it\u2019s not a replacement. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nShe really needs to get over herself, and she owes you an apology. I\u2019m sure she was a little taken aback. In her mind maybe you were going to stay in a nunnery for the rest of your life. \n\nI think you\u2019re very wise. You don\u2019t plan on anybody meeting the kids too quickly. You\u2019re enjoying being human. You\u2019re enjoying the human race. You\u2019re enjoying being social. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of that. You\u2019re not jumping into anything. You\u2019re not rushing.\n\nLet her backpedal. Both of you know what she was insinuating. And she couldn\u2019t be more wrong. \nNTA - good luck \u2b50\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYour SIL spoke without thinking and offensively.  She misses her departed brother and loves your children.  For her, your family is a wonderful, bittersweet reminder of her brother's life. While he is gone, the love he brought into this world lives on.  It hurts her to see that disrupted by you 'moving on'.\n\nOne problem with that, you aren't a living mausoleum to him. You are a person with a very long life ahead of you that doesn't need to be lived as an elegy.  You are completely right to move on, something any good partner would want you to do after they pass.\n\nYour SIL was good to apologize, but still tried to give a BS rationalization for her rudeness. I wouldn't drag her over the coals about it though.  I'd tell her I understand the concept is painful for her.  Ask her to refrain from commenting on your love life in the future and tell her you won't bring it up.", "So I see both sides of this. But let me start by saying you are NTA and indeed she is. \n\nI am a widow as well. I feel you girl, it is so hard and I did not have the added stress of children at home that I needed to stay mentally stable for. Absolute kudos to you and I bow my head with respect. \n\nThe average widow gets remarried in about 2 years. This means they must start dating much earlier. That you are four years in and just beginning to date shows you are allowing yourself to grieve properly while also focusing on your children. You are also not rushing things and are moving carefully. Well played my dear. \n\nNow lets talk about that SIL of yours. I want to bust her up for her move but I am going to go in a different direction. Make no mistake, she is wrong and TA but I want to point out why she may be acting like this. \n\nHer brother is gone. She may be worried that if you resume life as a normal red blooded woman, you will forget about him. This means his children would not be taught about him. \n\nShe can not ever replace her brother. No amount of dating sites, churches, bars, jobs, walks in the park etc will ever provide her with a new brother. So she feels a certain amount of stress over the idea of someone else thinking about filling his shoes in a different role. That does not mean you would handle it like that I am just pointing out her possible position. \n\nIt probably also caught her by surprise. She is watching you cruse along as a single mom. Establishing rules, struggling with bedtime, giving birth, moving in a forward direction. Then out of what see feels is nowhere, you drop a bomb on her. \n\nNone of those make her right, she is not. You are. I only put the reasons there to help you understand her position. You know, grief makes us irrational. \n\nGive her a chance, let her try to make this right. Again you are NTA. But I dont think she meant to be one either.", "NTA. You didn't take her words the wrong way, she just wants to not have to feel guilty for being an AH.", "NTA. And any apology that starts with, \"I'm sorry that YOU\" isn't an apology!", "NTA. Your SIL is supremely out of line and should not be excusing her behavior as \u201cprotecting\u201d your family. She needs to own her actions and learn to stay in her lane.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let this hamper your love life. You deserve to do what makes you happy and explore things. Being a widow doesn\u2019t mean you must swear off the comfort of a partner forever or for x amount of time.", "she threw around some seriously shitty accusations, and then sent you a non-apology. (i\u2019m sorry you took my words the wrong way is absolutely bs.) this was her selfishly lashing out, not her looking out for you and your kids. nta.", "NTA. 4 years is a respectful time to wait before dating by any reasonable measure. And you deserve companionship and love if that is what you need - being lonely won't help you to be a good parent. And being in a new relationship doesn't replace your old husband - this is something completely new. Your friend was right that your SIL was completely out of line. I think you are right - she isn't looking out for you and the kids - she is looking out for her image of you as the last connection to her brother. Which is wrong - she still has your kids and her memories of her brother. But she needs to understand that you are your own person with her own life, not some memory she can freeze in place.", "NTA at all, SIL comment is unfortunate but don\u2019t be put off your choices.  SIL just misses her brother and its hard for her that\u2019s all, give her some space and take it easy", "NTA. You are right and she is wrong!  She isn\u2019t over her brother passing and someone else standing in your life in the spot her brother stood in.  It is going to be hard for her no matter how long you wait.  You take care of yourself, live a happy life and if she can\u2019t join in your happiness the she doesn\u2019t need to be included any further.", "NTA. Of course you're not moving on too soon. It's ridiculous to think you need to remain alone for the rest of your life.\n\nYour SIL *was* absolutely 100% out of line. IMO if she was willing to give a real apology, I would consider forgiving her, but none of this BS \"I was just watching out for you\" nonsense.", "I met a woman similarly in your position, she was a Widow at 26 (although never married to him) and had two young children.  \nWe've been together for almost 3 years now.  \n\n\nThe difference with my situation though, is that she did not get the chance to grieve as long or as deeply as required, so there have been some grief issues that have come to the surface throughout our time together.  \n\n\nTime, and an abundance of patience has helped - and there are times I wish I would have met her 4 years after his passing than when I did, but I think you have done the right thing, and I really wish you the best.", "NTA. Sounds like maybe a knee jerk reaction from her and she reacted negatively without thinking. While \u201csorry you took her words the wrong way\u201d isn\u2019t *great* as far as apologies go, it sounds like you are/were close. Perhaps give her an opportunity to give an actual apology, and see what she does with that? I\u2019d say just make sure you know her actual feelings before you let your kids around her again, just so she doesn\u2019t fill their heads with alienating nonsense.", "NTA. You are allowed to have romance in your life if you feel that you are ready. Your SiL should be more compassionate.", ">saying she is sorry I took her words the wrong way\n\nSo in other words, she didn't apologize.", "NTA. I (m40) wouldn't expect my wife to go on alone if I would've passed away.\nIf you're not happy you can't be there for your kids. I love my wife and would want her to be happy even after I'm gone.\nI get your SIL's reaction though. IMO that has more to do with her and her pain than the fact that you might be doing something wrong.\nGive her time and try to find someone else to talk to about dating.", "NTA At all. And 4 years is definitely enough time for you to start a new relationship.\n\nI hope you and - especially - Ellie had some trauma therapy. I lost my parents in my teens and it would\u2019ve made a world of difference. \n\nYour SIL\u2019s reaction was terrible. I hope it was more of a spontaneous, knee-jerk reaction of surprise and sadness as you and your children such strong positive reminders of her brother. But I suspect many of your husband\u2019s relatives may have similar feelings as it can feel his memory is being erased.\n\nThat said, you\u2019ve grieved enough. It\u2019s also very important to teach your children how to move on with their lives after such a tragedy rather than letting that tragedy define the rest of your life.", "NTA by a mile.  4 years, 1 year, 20 years\u2026.number doesn\u2019t matter because when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019re ready.  You\u2019re not announcing an engagement after a few weeks of dating, just that you officially like the guy.  Maybe he\u2019ll be long term, maybe not, but that\u2019s up to you (and good job insulating your kids from new romances) to decide when you want companionship.\n\nYour SIL can grieve for years because she can still have a partner and family while grieving her brother.  Her non-apology makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t want you to have a love life outside of your deceased husband.  So if you want a relationship with her, it\u2019s going to have to be kids and surface things only until she\u2019s willing to accept that you\u2019re moving forward with your life.", "NTA. You have put your children first and continue to protect them now by keeping them separate from your venture back into dating. Maybe SIL isn\u2019t too good with words and opens her mouth before thinking, but in a genuine apology she should have apologized for what she said, not how you took it. There\u2019s a huge difference between accepting she was wrong and blaming you for misunderstanding. I hope that you find happiness.", "NTA, but hear me out. She\u2019s grieving the loss of her brother, who she\u2019s known her whole life. She\u2019s probably worried that if you find someone else, and possibly get married sometime in the future, that the relationship you have with her and the rest of your in laws will change. Will the new guy insist on being called Dad? Will he want pictures of your dead husband removed from the house? Will he want you to distance yourself and your kids from your previous in laws? Will the time she gets to spend with her nieces be reduced as you find a new normal with a new family? \n\nThere are plenty of stories of widows/widowers getting remarried and the previous in laws being shut out/put on the back burner, so I\u2019m sure her mind is reeling thinking about worst case scenarios. Give her a little grace, and talk with her about how important she is to you and your daughters. I\u2019m sure it was just a knee jerk reaction on her part.", "NTA\n\nBut give your SIL a chance to apologize. What she said was terrible and uncalled for, but may have just been an over-reaction. \n\nAs you mentioned you dating is a totally new thing, she's close with her nieces, and lost her brother. If she was blindsided by this, and hasn't properly processed losing her brother, it may have elicited an emotional response that even she didn't expect.\n\nOne caveat though, her comment that you took her words the wrong way and she's just looking out is explicitly out of line. She meant what she said, even if it was wildly inappropriate and isn't what she feels outside of that initial moment of shock. \n\nIt would be nice if she straight up acknowledges that part of the f-up; though it's possible that won't be the case. Its sort of a natural defense mechanism, rightly or wrongly, to minimize ones own actions while apologizing just out of a desire to save face or due to embarrassment. How far you should press that issue is going to depend on what your needs are. \n\nIf you can accept that it was possibly just a reactionary comment and can let it go, it's alright to do so out of concern for her.  It may be better to just accept the interaction for what it was and move on from it.\n\nIf you don't feel you can do that, that's alright too; you have no obligation to bear the burdens imposed by her trauma and shouldn't be expected or required to.\n\nIn either case, it would be worth making it clear that those kinds of judgements can't continue in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yours you get to move on from and find someone else, there's they get to put up sign saying \"don't fall in\" and learn to live with. They never move on because it's not a move on situation it's a learn to live with. Your SiL is not the right person to ask to cheer on your new life, that isn't very respectful of you to ask.

I don\u2019t think you should cut her off by any means, but I would definitely grey rock her until you\u2019re comfortable or she actually apologizes.", "NTA  you sil is being TA", "Saying she is sorry that you took her words the wrong way is NOT an apology. She was out of line. Everyone works through grief and change at their own pace. Even if you met someone new much earlier, she still would have been out of line.", "NTA. You deserve to be loved and love. It's probably best from now on, to separate your dating life and not tell your SIL anything about it anymore. People grieve differently and she probably felt like you were somehow disrespecting your late husband (which you are not). \nBest of luck in the dating scene OP", "NTA four years is 4X longer than the \"one year\" which is socially acceptable for mourning.", "NTA it is BS, your SIL is probably, selfishly, thinking that she doesn\u2019t want your current dynamic to change. She doesn\u2019t want you to move on from her brother. She doesn\u2019t want you to potentially remarry and potentially for mire in-laws or children to be in the mix. \n\nUntil she apologizes properly, not \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you took her words the wrong way\u201d, you should limit discussions about your personal/romantic life.", "NTA. Move on at your own pace, but 4 years is definitely on the conservative side. You're good, she's just upset and is taking it out on you, but you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA ..but you had time to adjust to the idea of dating and a new bf. Your SIL has not. Be patient.", "NTA. Her \u201capology\u201d for how you took her words was not an apology. Honestly, she probably expected you to be alone until she was long over her grief. You are doing what\u2019s right for you, and by doing that you are doing what\u2019s right for your girls. Your late husband wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to wallow alone in misery for the rest of your life. Hugs babe \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. SIL on another note totally TA. \nTake your time to allow yourself to get in contact again, she did on purpose.\n\nI myself have experience of the deceased\u2019s family being inappropriate years after the death because some entitlement of how \u201cyou\u201d should be the walking banner of the existence of the passed loved one FOREVER - like \u201cyour\u201d existence should be just to honour the deceased instead to being an actual person that in the health end will overcome the grieving.\n\nUntil you are healed enough to just not care at all about people trying to minimise your (past) suffering: take your time without contact except for the kids sake of having extended family.", "Your friend is absolutely correct.  Your SIL was probably blindsided not expecting you to move on, and that is on her, and probably unwise.   You are correct you should not lay down and bury yourself.   Your girls need to learn what healthy relationships are.   You are also correct not to introduce them to anyone just yet, until you are more sure about the relationship.   Now you have the joy of making sure that your SIL doe snot say anything snarky to your girls - \u201cmommy is going out on dates now, guess is has forgotten all about daddy\u201d type things.    Because sometimes relatives suck.    You also should think about having a conversation with your older daughter, let her know you are starting to interact with men.   You are allowed to have adult relationships with men, that is normal.", "NTA you didn\u2019t take her words the wrong way, she is embarrassed, and abashed, because you understood precisely what she was saying, and called her out on it. \n\nUnfortunately, your husband\u2019s family is probably not going to take it well when you do move on, no matter how long it is. She was not the one to share your excitement with, no matter how close you\u2019ve been as sisters-in-law.\n\nI hope that you and Danny really have something together and your in-laws can support you after their own fresh grieving period", "I just looked it up in an old manual I had out in the garage. Yeah, 4 years, 37 minutes, and 23 seconds is when you are free and clear to move on, miss. You can tell SIL it's official and all.\n\nSIL thinks you should have climbed on the funeral pyre to burn with her brother, your husband, but you just tell her you will not be engaging in any such cultural appropriation and instead become happy with a new guy. You are a saint, NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut give your SIL another chance. Based on your post, she didn't say anything so egregious as to warrant cutting her out of your life forever.", "NTA sorry for your loss. I would never speak to her about my private life and only speak of the kids. Keep her in an information diet", "NTA, apologizing for how you \u2018took it\u2019s is not an apology.", "NTA, she needs to get therapy to deal with her grief, though. She\u2019s taking out her resentment at his loss on you.", "NTA- You're allowed to have companionship. Her grief is talking, but she has the benefit of not feeling guilty about dating or raising children alone after her brother died. It is unfair to place that unnecessary burden onto you because she misses him. You know this, but it bears repeating sometimes.", "NTA", "NTA.  SIL is the AH.", "Noting how SIL worded her apology - she's not sorry for what she said, she is sorry that you took her words the wrong way.", "NTA. Her response might have been motivated by grief but it was still out of line for her to say those things to you, then \"apologize\" by saying you took her the wrong way. \n\nNobody should expect a widower to stay single forever, or try to set rules around when that person can begin dating again. You deserve to be happy and to seek out happiness.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry your SIL reacted that way so selfish and just wrong.", "NTA. Your friend is absolutely right. You didn\u2019t take anything the wrong way.", "NTA. Perhaps she is afraid she will lose you and the children. She sees you and the children as a connection to her deceased brother. She overreacted, give her some time to reconsider her words then maybe try to have a conversation with her. I think you were right to give her a heads up rather than letting her find out another way. I wish you the best.", "I think SIL just hasn't moved on yet so she is just imposing it to you that you shouldn't too yet. But in all angles, you have all the rights to put yourself back there. Its hard to keep your children happy if you yourself is not genuinely happy inside.", ">sorry I took her words the wrong way\n\nThats not an apology thats literally, \"sorry you were offended\" with different words. And you took her words EXACTLY as she meant them! Shes only fauxpologizing because she F'ed up and she knows it.\n\nNTA.", ">she is sorry I took her words the wrong way\n\nThat is a non-apology.  Apologies do not go \"I'm sorry you...\" They go \"I'm sorry I did [x] which was wrong because [y] and that it hurt you in [z] way. I won't do it again.\" NTA", "NTA. Also lost my husband when he was 32, and I was alone for about 4 years. His family turned on me for some reason soon after he died. I don't know if it was grief or what, but everything I did was wrong. They even lied to others about me! \n\nYou didn't misunderstand her. She's not looking out for you and the kids. She's never thought of you being with anyone but her brother, and she's currently going to see anyone who you date as his replacement. I'd be straightforward with her that \"I'm sorry but....\" isn't going to do it for you.", "NTA\n\nIf you \u201ctook the words the wrong way\u201d then what way did she mean them? She should tell you, specifically what she meant and what exactly she was \u201clooking out for.\u201d \n\nShe won\u2019t be able to. Because she said what she said and she meant it. Idk what other meaning there could be to saying that you\u2019re moving on too quickly and trying to replace your late husband. Ask her to explain it in small words. \n\nThen tell her you expect a REAL apology.", "Your sil is still grieving. You're less so grieving. It's hard, at best, for her to watch you move on. So her feelings are valid, for her, but should have stayed inside her head. That shit is what therapy is for. And you? Nta.i wish you the best in romance and love. May or become someone you DO want to meet the kids, someday.", "NTA, but also, trying not to be too hard on the SIL.  It sounds like you are dealing with loss in different ways.  What she said still wasn't okay, but hopefully it was just a knee jerk reaction.", "NTA my regards for your husbands death but everyone deserves to find love again in life", "NTA you absolutely deserve to have a life and 4 years is a long time being lonely. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, but you deserve to be happy again don\u2019t let her take that from you \ud83d\ude1e", "You have every right to keep living.  Four years is a long time.   I think your SIL had an emotional rection to the idea of her brother being replaced.   She has no control over your actions, and her comments were not fair, but she has also been mourning John.   \n\nIf she has otherwise been a good friend/aunt, I'd accept her apology and put the whole thing behind both of you.", "Maybe she wasn\u2019t. I just thought I could trust her enough to open up that\u2019s all. I\u2019m not really close to my family so she is the closest I have to it", "I don\u2019t know. Her words have really cut deep. Perhaps the relationship was good because I appeared to be fine with being on my own and tried to convince myself I was so much that I said it other people.", "I think for a lot of people, when others move on, it makes the reality that someone is gone for good hit home. So they lash out, rather than face it, cause it\u2019s easier to have someone to blame.", "Beautifully said", "I wish I could upvote this more! This all of this!!!", "I\u2019m processing the loss of a loved one just a year ago and struggling with possibly  moving forward with a potential new love who feels so right to me. I needed to hear these words myself, thank you for your beautiful way with words and emotions.", "This is probably the best advice here, op you should take it.", "Well said", "Great insight.  To add, maybe SIL thinks the kids won't be part of their lives anymore if you start a new relationship and family?", "This is an amazing response... Just damn... There are some true gems I've seen in responses but this might be the shiniest one.", "As a widower, I completely agree here. It can be difficult for their family. My (ex) MIL told me she was so scared that she would lose her son to. She didn't react well to me dating. It was a fear response.", "This! All the comments saying \u201cwell she apologized\u201d WHERE. WHERE IS THE APOLOGY.", "I\u2019m not replacing him though that\u2019s the thing. He is the father of my children and that will never be forgotten.\n\nI am just incredibly lonely and have met someone who makes me happy. I am not looking for a father for my children, I just don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life on my own. I miss a romantic connection.", "It wasn\u2019t a celebration I was looking for.

It\u2019s not the same as an apology. I can\u2019t imagine losing my husband at such a young age and trying to help a young child navigate the loss of her father. Not to mention being pregnant and having to give birth and raise a baby alone as well. If OPs SIL cared about her at all she wouldn\u2019t have said anything. She waited 4 years not 4 months. What she said about moving on too quickly and replacing her husband as reprehensible. At least now OP knows what her SIL thinks about her and her happiness.", "\"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is NOT an actual, sincere apology. Following it up with a condescending \"just looking out for you and the kids\" is doubling down on not actually apologizing. Then there's the classic \"your trying to replace my brother\" / you're moving too fast which is the War Cry of every family member who thinks the widow left behind needs to be entombed. \n\nSiL isn't very concerned about OP. Her brother's children are her focus. Given a chance, she will do everything she can to poison or derail any relationship OP may pursue if it becomes something deeper.\n\nThe SiL started hot and attacked.

NTA hoping this was just a knee jerk reaction on her part.", "It may be that she suddenly felt 'confronted' with the reality that her brother really was *gone* in that moment and she took her denial out on you. I'm sorry for your loss and hope you find love for you and your kiddos. NTA", "Maybe starting with I have been thinking about getting back into the dating world again. Ease into things a bit.", "This is your cue to never trust her nor discuss personal matters with her. \nNTA", "Don\u2019t let this ruin your relationship with SIL. It\u2019s emotional and touchy for both of you. She will come around on you dating. \n\nAlso take it easy dating. Going to take time and learn some hard lessons. Its rough out there. Dont rush into a relationship", "You have been fine with being on your own for four years though. It's just that you want something more. \n\nYour SIL was wrong, but I can understand her shock and grief can be weird. Be open if she offers a real apology. If not, just be guarded about what you tell her in the future and try to move forward not move on,  as some other wise poster said here.", "And this is a very reasonable, healthy mindset. You didn't do anything wrong, your SIL was out of fucking line. You deserve to find what you want, and I hope everything works out well for you with this guy.

John's life ended 4 years ago, not yours.", "No but you get what I mean though right.
