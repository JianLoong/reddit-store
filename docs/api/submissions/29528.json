I spent 9 wonderful years with my husband John and we were happily married for more than 6 of those years. We welcomed our first daughter Ellie (11F) and he was a doting father to her. His death was so unexpected and sudden, as he was only 32 and it broke me and Ellie. It was even sadder because we had found out not long before he died that I was pregnant with Sophie (3F) and he never got to meet her.\n\nI have spent the past 4+ years being on my own. All my attention went to Ellie to help cope with losing her dad and to provide as best a life I could for her and my then unborn child as a single mom. I convinced myself I was content with being fulfilled by motherhood and watching the 2 people I love more than anything grow and be happy but it\u2019s been incredibly lonely. I have missed company and companionship or even just having someone to talk to, so I decided to put myself back out there.\n\nI joined a dating site around 2/3 months ago and I really hit it off with Danny after being on there for a couple of weeks (35M). We have been on several dates and have been talking a lot. I know it\u2019s early days but it honesty feels refreshing just having someone to talk to about my day or about me as I spent so long just forgetting about me for the sake of my kids that it\u2019s nice that someone wants to know me. It\u2019s like I have opened up a part of myself and allowed myself to be happy after so long. I loved my husband very much and I have missed him terribly but I know he\u2019s never coming back. I think 4 years is a long time to spend on your own and I think even I have left it long enough that it\u2019s okay to meet someone else.\n\nI was really excited so I decided to tell my SIL, my late husband\u2019s sister as she is very close to my nieces and helped me a lot when John died. I told her that I have met someone, it is going well, he is very nice, I feel happy around him and that I hope it progresses eventually. She didn\u2019t take the news well and actually got really angry and said that I\u2019m moving on too quickly and that I\u2019m trying to replace John. I got really angry myself and I snapped. I asked her how long she expected me to be on my own? 5 years? 10? Until the kids are grown? I told her I have spent 4 years mourning and that she had some nerve to insinuate my husband\u2019s death meant nothing to me and that I\u2019m going to let some random man enter my children\u2019s lives which isn\u2019t happening at all. He hasn\u2019t met my kids and he isn\u2019t going to any time soon if at all depending on how well things go with us. Plus, I am not looking for someone to replace John or someone to become a dad to my children. I just miss romance that\u2019s all.\n\nI haven\u2019t really spoken to her since as her comments have left me furious. She has sent me messages saying she is sorry I took her words the wrong way but that she is just looking out for me and the kids but I think it\u2019s BS. I have been discussing this with a friend of mine and asked for her opinion. She thinks I have sacrificed a lot over the last few years and I am allowed to move on with my life. She also says my SIL is completely out of line and was deeply insensitive especially since my husband\u2019s death completely broke me and it was like my whole world was taken from me.", "created_utc": 1698100571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ex9ko/aita_for_snapping_at_my_sil_after_she_accused_me/", "score": 2586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone grieves differently\u2014but four years seems like a socially appropriate amount of time for you to have put off dating. Maybe your SIL just wasn\u2019t the right person to share your news with\u2026in hindsight.", "NTA - she crossed a line for sure. It\u2019s such a shame she couldn\u2019t be happy for you after all this time. You sound like you had a good relationship before that though so will you be able to forgive her?", "You cannot replace what is irreplaceable. There is no substitute either.\nYou loved him. He loved you. It was magic. That\u2019s wonderful. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you went through.\n\nPeople grieve differently. People process pain and loss in different ways. You\u2019ve had time alone with your thoughts. You\u2019ve had family to help you. You\u2019ve been through hell and you have come out the other side. \n\nAnd guess what? You are entitled to continue living \u2665\ufe0f\n\nIt sounds to me like you\u2019re ready to move forward. (Notice I do not say \u201cmoving on\u201d... Please see my first statement.) Regardless of if it\u2019s this guy or not, when you are ready, you will not be replacing, because this will be completely new and not the same at all. You had a great love. Your next relationship may be a great love as well. Frankly, I don\u2019t like settling for anything less. But it\u2019s not going to be the same. And it\u2019s not a replacement. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nShe really needs to get over herself, and she owes you an apology. I\u2019m sure she was a little taken aback. In her mind maybe you were going to stay in a nunnery for the rest of your life. \n\nI think you\u2019re very wise. You don\u2019t plan on anybody meeting the kids too quickly. You\u2019re enjoying being human. You\u2019re enjoying the human race. You\u2019re enjoying being social. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of that. You\u2019re not jumping into anything. You\u2019re not rushing.\n\nLet her backpedal. Both of you know what she was insinuating. And she couldn\u2019t be more wrong. \nNTA - good luck \u2b50\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYour SIL spoke without thinking and offensively.  She misses her departed brother and loves your children.  For her, your family is a wonderful, bittersweet reminder of her brother's life. While he is gone, the love he brought into this world lives on.  It hurts her to see that disrupted by you 'moving on'.\n\nOne problem with that, you aren't a living mausoleum to him. You are a person with a very long life ahead of you that doesn't need to be lived as an elegy.  You are completely right to move on, something any good partner would want you to do after they pass.\n\nYour SIL was good to apologize, but still tried to give a BS rationalization for her rudeness. I wouldn't drag her over the coals about it though.  I'd tell her I understand the concept is painful for her.  Ask her to refrain from commenting on your love life in the future and tell her you won't bring it up.", "So I see both sides of this. But let me start by saying you are NTA and indeed she is. \n\nI am a widow as well. I feel you girl, it is so hard and I did not have the added stress of children at home that I needed to stay mentally stable for. Absolute kudos to you and I bow my head with respect. \n\nThe average widow gets remarried in about 2 years. This means they must start dating much earlier. That you are four years in and just beginning to date shows you are allowing yourself to grieve properly while also focusing on your children. You are also not rushing things and are moving carefully. Well played my dear. \n\nNow lets talk about that SIL of yours. I want to bust her up for her move but I am going to go in a different direction. Make no mistake, she is wrong and TA but I want to point out why she may be acting like this. \n\nHer brother is gone. She may be worried that if you resume life as a normal red blooded woman, you will forget about him. This means his children would not be taught about him. \n\nShe can not ever replace her brother. No amount of dating sites, churches, bars, jobs, walks in the park etc will ever provide her with a new brother. So she feels a certain amount of stress over the idea of someone else thinking about filling his shoes in a different role. That does not mean you would handle it like that I am just pointing out her possible position. \n\nIt probably also caught her by surprise. She is watching you cruse along as a single mom. Establishing rules, struggling with bedtime, giving birth, moving in a forward direction. Then out of what see feels is nowhere, you drop a bomb on her. \n\nNone of those make her right, she is not. You are. I only put the reasons there to help you understand her position. You know, grief makes us irrational. \n\nGive her a chance, let her try to make this right. Again you are NTA. But I dont think she meant to be one either.", "NTA. You didn't take her words the wrong way, she just wants to not have to feel guilty for being an AH.", "NTA. And any apology that starts with, \"I'm sorry that YOU\" isn't an apology!", "NTA. Your SIL is supremely out of line and should not be excusing her behavior as \u201cprotecting\u201d your family. She needs to own her actions and learn to stay in her lane.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let this hamper your love life. You deserve to do what makes you happy and explore things. Being a widow doesn\u2019t mean you must swear off the comfort of a partner forever or for x amount of time.", "she threw around some seriously shitty accusations, and then sent you a non-apology. (i\u2019m sorry you took my words the wrong way is absolutely bs.) this was her selfishly lashing out, not her looking out for you and your kids. nta.", "NTA. 4 years is a respectful time to wait before dating by any reasonable measure. And you deserve companionship and love if that is what you need - being lonely won't help you to be a good parent. And being in a new relationship doesn't replace your old husband - this is something completely new. Your friend was right that your SIL was completely out of line. I think you are right - she isn't looking out for you and the kids - she is looking out for her image of you as the last connection to her brother. Which is wrong - she still has your kids and her memories of her brother. But she needs to understand that you are your own person with her own life, not some memory she can freeze in place.", "NTA at all, SIL comment is unfortunate but don\u2019t be put off your choices.  SIL just misses her brother and its hard for her that\u2019s all, give her some space and take it easy", "NTA. You are right and she is wrong!  She isn\u2019t over her brother passing and someone else standing in your life in the spot her brother stood in.  It is going to be hard for her no matter how long you wait.  You take care of yourself, live a happy life and if she can\u2019t join in your happiness the she doesn\u2019t need to be included any further.", "NTA. Of course you're not moving on too soon. It's ridiculous to think you need to remain alone for the rest of your life.\n\nYour SIL *was* absolutely 100% out of line. IMO if she was willing to give a real apology, I would consider forgiving her, but none of this BS \"I was just watching out for you\" nonsense.", "I met a woman similarly in your position, she was a Widow at 26 (although never married to him) and had two young children.  \nWe've been together for almost 3 years now.  \n\n\nThe difference with my situation though, is that she did not get the chance to grieve as long or as deeply as required, so there have been some grief issues that have come to the surface throughout our time together.  \n\n\nTime, and an abundance of patience has helped - and there are times I wish I would have met her 4 years after his passing than when I did, but I think you have done the right thing, and I really wish you the best.", "NTA. Sounds like maybe a knee jerk reaction from her and she reacted negatively without thinking. While \u201csorry you took her words the wrong way\u201d isn\u2019t *great* as far as apologies go, it sounds like you are/were close. Perhaps give her an opportunity to give an actual apology, and see what she does with that? I\u2019d say just make sure you know her actual feelings before you let your kids around her again, just so she doesn\u2019t fill their heads with alienating nonsense.", "NTA. You are allowed to have romance in your life if you feel that you are ready. Your SiL should be more compassionate.", ">saying she is sorry I took her words the wrong way\n\nSo in other words, she didn't apologize.", "NTA. I (m40) wouldn't expect my wife to go on alone if I would've passed away.\nIf you're not happy you can't be there for your kids. I love my wife and would want her to be happy even after I'm gone.\nI get your SIL's reaction though. IMO that has more to do with her and her pain than the fact that you might be doing something wrong.\nGive her time and try to find someone else to talk to about dating.", "NTA At all. And 4 years is definitely enough time for you to start a new relationship.\n\nI hope you and - especially - Ellie had some trauma therapy. I lost my parents in my teens and it would\u2019ve made a world of difference. \n\nYour SIL\u2019s reaction was terrible. I hope it was more of a spontaneous, knee-jerk reaction of surprise and sadness as you and your children such strong positive reminders of her brother. But I suspect many of your husband\u2019s relatives may have similar feelings as it can feel his memory is being erased.\n\nThat said, you\u2019ve grieved enough. It\u2019s also very important to teach your children how to move on with their lives after such a tragedy rather than letting that tragedy define the rest of your life.", "NTA by a mile.  4 years, 1 year, 20 years\u2026.number doesn\u2019t matter because when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019re ready.  You\u2019re not announcing an engagement after a few weeks of dating, just that you officially like the guy.  Maybe he\u2019ll be long term, maybe not, but that\u2019s up to you (and good job insulating your kids from new romances) to decide when you want companionship.\n\nYour SIL can grieve for years because she can still have a partner and family while grieving her brother.  Her non-apology makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t want you to have a love life outside of your deceased husband.  So if you want a relationship with her, it\u2019s going to have to be kids and surface things only until she\u2019s willing to accept that you\u2019re moving forward with your life.", "NTA. You have put your children first and continue to protect them now by keeping them separate from your venture back into dating. Maybe SIL isn\u2019t too good with words and opens her mouth before thinking, but in a genuine apology she should have apologized for what she said, not how you took it. There\u2019s a huge difference between accepting she was wrong and blaming you for misunderstanding. I hope that you find happiness.", "NTA, but hear me out. She\u2019s grieving the loss of her brother, who she\u2019s known her whole life. She\u2019s probably worried that if you find someone else, and possibly get married sometime in the future, that the relationship you have with her and the rest of your in laws will change. Will the new guy insist on being called Dad? Will he want pictures of your dead husband removed from the house? Will he want you to distance yourself and your kids from your previous in laws? Will the time she gets to spend with her nieces be reduced as you find a new normal with a new family? \n\nThere are plenty of stories of widows/widowers getting remarried and the previous in laws being shut out/put on the back burner, so I\u2019m sure her mind is reeling thinking about worst case scenarios. Give her a little grace, and talk with her about how important she is to you and your daughters. I\u2019m sure it was just a knee jerk reaction on her part.", "NTA\n\nBut give your SIL a chance to apologize. What she said was terrible and uncalled for, but may have just been an over-reaction. \n\nAs you mentioned you dating is a totally new thing, she's close with her nieces, and lost her brother. If she was blindsided by this, and hasn't properly processed losing her brother, it may have elicited an emotional response that even she didn't expect.\n\nOne caveat though, her comment that you took her words the wrong way and she's just looking out is explicitly out of line. She meant what she said, even if it was wildly inappropriate and isn't what she feels outside of that initial moment of shock. \n\nIt would be nice if she straight up acknowledges that part of the f-up; though it's possible that won't be the case. Its sort of a natural defense mechanism, rightly or wrongly, to minimize ones own actions while apologizing just out of a desire to save face or due to embarrassment. How far you should press that issue is going to depend on what your needs are. \n\nIf you can accept that it was possibly just a reactionary comment and can let it go, it's alright to do so out of concern for her.  It may be better to just accept the interaction for what it was and move on from it.\n\nIf you don't feel you can do that, that's alright too; you have no obligation to bear the burdens imposed by her trauma and shouldn't be expected or required to.\n\nIn either case, it would be worth making it clear that those kinds of judgements can't continue in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yours you get to move on from and find someone else, there's they get to put up sign saying \"don't fall in\" and learn to live with. They never move on because it's not a move on situation it's a learn to live with. Your SiL is not the right person to ask to cheer on your new life, that isn't very respectful of you to ask.

You lost a husband whom you loved for 9 years. Your SIL lost a brother she loved for almost her whole life. You can meet someone wonderful and have a new husband. She can never replace her brother.

I also had time to do a lot of grieving as her health declined - pre-grief is a real thing! And my wife was very firm that I was not to be alone too long, but I was to find someone new because she knew I world be unhappy alone.\n\nWhen she passed away, I was then Mum/SpareMum to my two adult daughters and my wife's two adult children, all living out of home. I worked hard to ensure that we were still a family unit with regular catchups and dinners.\n\nBut...it was LONELY. Especially Sunday afternoons when other people do family things.\n\nSo after only four months, not four years, I decided to try dating. Here's the step I think you missed. I sat down with the kids, one at a time, and said that I was thinking of trying dating and asked them how they felt, whether they wanted to know about my dates or not etc. I laid down some groundwork because I was concerned about their feelings. I didn't HAVE to do this but I wanted to include them and they are my family.\n\nFortunately they were onboard and said they were happy to hear about the dates but not anything intimate (of course!). As it turns out, I met a wonderful man. My kids and step kids all love him and we married last year. My late wife's family have embraced him too and included him in the family.\n\nSo it can work out.

It's those moments when grief hits like a shock, and oh, that person is dead again. And over time, those moments come less, grow softer, like pebbles on a beach smoothed our by the sea. \n\nI think your SIL ran into one of those moments. She could keep her brother, the part of him that was your husband, your kids dad, alive a bit longer as long as that didn't change.

It's understandable that she might... Regress, I guess, but it's less what she said in the moment, and more that she can't about it afterwards, that she's saying she's looking out for you - looking out would have been asking what he was like, it'd be good to meet him sometime, how are you feeling, not \"this is too soon and you're trying to replace my brother.\"\n\nI think you may need to tell her that, because you're not the preservation of her brother's memory and she needs to accept that her reaction is about her. It's not unnatural, but that doesn't mean that it's acceptable or appropriate, and you didn't misunderstand what she was saying.

She is still grieving the loss of her brother and maybe she is afraid that you dating and eventually marrying again will mean she gets less time with her nieces as you spend more time with his family. \n\nAgain, not saying she is right but family is complex.

We (irrationally) felt that dad was going to be replaced. \nWe never voiced our displeasure (though I'm sure that mum could feel it) Anyway,  we got over it. I'll admit, it's been almost 20 years, and it's still weird at times for us. However, we get along well with mum's partner, and we have full respect for thier relationship.\n\nSo it's not BS and no, SIL should not be blocked!!!!.\n\nOP, gently, gently with your late husbands family. They'll come around...........eventually.\n\nETA: It will always feel weird at times for SIL and family. For us, it's Christmas. It's only natural that we miss and wish that our loved one was there. Also, dad's birthday is weird for us. It's hard for us to talk about dad with mum's partner present. \nThis is where great communication is paramount. We brought up the subject of dad's birthday with mum, and she agreed that on that one day of the year, for dinner her partner is not present. It was weird for him, too. I understand that he doesn't want to live in the past and hear about just how great our dad was and how we wish that he was still here.", "You're attacking OP for not thinking hard enough about her sister in law's feelings? And then you suggest to OP that four years 'might be enough for you', but SiL was flesh and blood and it really takes time for her to grieve, as though being married to and having two children with someone is a trifling connection. Then the icing on the cake is telling OP the 'kind' thing to do, as if you haven't just heaped unkindness on OP.", "[removed]", "If the sister is still grieving that hard, it means she\u2019s not ready for another brother. Her grief has zero to do with whether on not it\u2019s appropriate for OP to date. No sane, reasonable, non-AH would think 4+ years isn\u2019t enough time for someone to date after losing their spouse, especially so young, and having the nerve to actually say something so horrible out loud to a widow is the height of selfishness and insensitivity.", "Hopefully they can come to an understanding, but SIL didn't truly apologize. She gave a weasel's apology - \"I'm sorry you were offended\"", "I agree with you that she had a strong emotional reaction and that she apologized. For me tho, the way op summarizes the apology describes a **pretty shit apology**.\n\nTo be fair, obvi this whole story is from op\u2019s pov \u2014 from the original injury to the apology. But if someone apologizes to me for the way I took something, that doesn\u2019t strike me as a real apology. \n\nHowever, SIL is trying to make amends. And like you said, important and loving to the daughters. So sounds like actual conversation and communication would be wise. SIL does seem like she cares, even if she really stepped in it.", "What SIL did was 100% a non-apology. If SIL actually does apologize, then great. Until then, it would be best for OP not to share anything related to her dating life.", "What a wonderful thing to have said to you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Wow! Brought tears to my eyes. What an amazing Grandpa to think this. \nHope you are doing ok. \nAs well as OP and anyone else who lost their significant other. \nI can\u2019t imagine the pain you are all dealing with. Especially when so young.\n\nMy sister in law lost my brother in law almost 10 years ago. She just said how she has been talking to someone from her home town and went to school with for awhile now. They got along and they have been doing trips back and forth. She asked my husband is he was ok with it. My husband was really close to his brother. Looked up to him and went through a rough grieving phase. He said his brother would want her to be happy. That at 30 he wouldn\u2019t want her to stay single. She was so relieved. Her next step was talking to her/our mil and step FIL. My husband said they will be ok. They don\u2019t expect you to stay single.\nHer child met him recently and have lots in common. Good to see. Hope things work out for them and anyone else reaching out for friendship/companionship/romance.\nYou all deserve it. You all have been through what I can only imagine. \nTake care and sending big hugs.\ud83d\udc95", "My wife also died rather suddenly - it took me six months to even join a dating site - her parents are gently encouraging me to find someone - I don\u2019t cook - I\u2019m not good at cleaning and I still sleep on the couch - I joined the dating sites but they seem to be a waste of time so I\u2019m watching more movies that make me smile rather than women who are annoyed I didn\u2019t send a good morning message", "Oh 100% she's trying to downplay how rude what she did was.", "Yeah I'm hoping still cause that's still gross", "Yeah that wasn't a real apology from SIL.", "OP was under no obligation to inform SIL that she was ready to move forward with her life.", "Indeed.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
