She\u2019s just being catty, and that\u2019s her issue.\n\nI get that you might feel embarrassed, but people now know to bring some more sodas to the gatherings. It sucks that she had to be snide about it and  gossip with the family, but now you know exactly how entitled Auntie gets, so deal with her appropriately going forward.", "NTA. \n\nIf they buy 50(!) Cans of beer and one soda for kids, they clearly do not give a crap about their kids anyway.\n\nIt does sound like alcoholism, though.", "NTA.\n\nI'm assuming you're talking about 2 liter bottles of soda. If so, your math checks out. Fifty cans of Budweiser on sale near me costs about $40, so $0.80 each. Coke or Pepsi on sale near me costs about $3.30, so right around the cost of four cans of beer. Each two liter bottle contains about five 12-ounce servings. So it's only slightly less expensive per serving than beer.\n\nYour family clearly prioritizes having an ample amount of beer servings on hand, but not soda. As someone who doesn't drink beer, that's a problem for you.\n\nBased on the established rules, families that want to drink soda should provide their own. Or the host family should buy a lot more than just one bottle. It would take two bottles for the ten of your to each get one serving. Sounds to me like four or five would be an appropriate amount.\n\nGetting snarky about you following the rules by bringing your own and not sharing is ridiculous and makes your aunt an AH.\n\nBut, if you can afford it, paying $12 or $15 and bringing four bottles to share next time could make you a hero.", "I think NTA but would also just take an extra bottle in future, I know its not your responsibility, but they are kids and would probs make them really happy that someone thought of them", "NTA\n\nWhile my friends love a beer from time to time, those six people seem **really** heavy on the alcohol.    A can of beer can cost around $5 these days.  So, for the cost of 2 cans of beer, they could have gotten a 12 pack of Coke. \n\nMore than enough for all of the kids.  It was **NOT** your obligation to buy soda for all the kids.  \n\nIf your uncle can afford  50 cans of beer, he could easily have eased up on the alcohol a bit and gotten enough soda for everyone.  And, bluntly, if 6 people aren't happy with less than a **six pack each**, that's too much alcohol IMO.\n\nYour uncle is TA for insisting it's your responsibility to buy the soda.", "NTA if the issue is that they are putting having beers above their own children having soda and expecting someone else to provide that soda instead, they suck. IDC what their financial situation is, it's obviously good enough for the adults to have multiple beers (which costs way more than a pack of soda)", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants her kids to have soft drink then she needs to provide it, simple.\nPersonally I'd just swig it from the bottle- don't want to spread your germs.", "Nta and just don\u2019t engage with this issue further. Let the ball they throw of snarky comments just drop to the floor. Do not pick it up. You could have said, sounds great, very thoughtful. Move on and don\u2019t engage. \n\nThey don\u2019t want to accept the implications that they are being crappy humans who repeatedly prioritized their money for alcohol over consideration for their own kids. Not your responsibility. You were absolutely petty though- if you can afford it just bring a couple liters to share because you focus on just being a thoughtful person, not a petty one.", "NTA there poor planning is not your fault", "NTA. If you were vegetarian and brought the only vegetarian dish to a family gathering, it would be really crappy for people to expect you to share when that meant you might be left without anything to eat.\n\nYou don\u2019t drink alcohol, so you brought drinks that you CAN drink. The fact that some kids saw that and wanted soda for themselves is not your fault. You\u2019re not drinking anyone else\u2019s Buds so why would anyone else be entitled to your drinks?\n\nWould I have messaged your aunt about her snarky comment? No, but she drew first blood on that so your response isn\u2019t enough for me to change my vote to ESH.", "NTA, but next time just bring 2 12-packs.  1 for you and 1 for the kids or whomever else.  What's it costing you to keep the peace?  A 12 pack of cokes?\n\nUp to you, but is this a hill worth dying on?  You're call, of course.  I'd support you either way.", "I don't know what's going on here but it's very unfortunate that the family seems to have plenty on hand for the adults and overlooks those two young to drink alcohol.\n\nAll I can say is when I pack a cooler to go to an event I'm putting what I want for myself in there and then doubling or tripling it. Part of the fun of gathering says the communal element. The flip side of that is if you're always getting together with the same group of people and it's always on you it gets annoying. The double flip side is that you could still do it anyways. My mother was super frugal. My aunt's uncles and grandparents all went out of their way to do little extra things for me and my siblings because they know my mom want it. I'm sure they all had a bad attitude towards her about it but they treated me phenomenally. Fast forward and now I'm a grown up and I like all of them a lot more than I like my own mother. So possibly just pack the pop for nieces and nephews because it's a nice thing to do.", "YTA\n\nNot for not sharing your ONE can but if you are already aware that they tend to buy way too many beers and you want soda, and that you ran out of your one soda, why not buy a pack of soda so that you have some to share?  Buying ONE drink for yourself is rude and thoughtless. I almost said E S H but I realize that maybe the rest of your family never thought about soda because they have juice and water, and so until you started bringing soda, it was never an issue. Like yes bring your own drink but who brings one can? You bring a 2 liter so others who may want some can get some.", "ESH unless your can't buy more than a coke for financial reasons", "ESH. Sounds like you lot could do with communicating ahead of time and appointing someone in charge of soft drinks so these arguments don't break out in the first place. Clearly this arrangement isn't working, but it appears nobody seems to be trying to revise it?", "INFO\n\n> This happened a while ago, but I still get criticized. \n\nAre you talking two months ago, or several years ago?", "YTA, not for not sharing your drinks, but for messaging people about it.
