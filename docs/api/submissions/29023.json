I can understand some doctors gets bitter when they feel they got a raw deal, but also grow up, there are always going to be people who have a nicer life than you.", "NTA. His fragile ego was not your responsibility to maintain. You handled his jealousy and barbs with remarkable grace, which honestly only makes you look better. \n\nPS: I AM a doctor and I am also super envious of your work life balance, but I don't need to whine and accuse you to make myself feel better about it. I can just be happy for you, like a decent human being.", "What do you do for a living anyway OP? It sounds like I missed my calling! (mini haha!)", "NTA\n\nHope she dumps him", "NTA I think you did have to put him down. That's exactly what he was trying to do to you.\n\nWhat his GF is actually saying is that you should have allowed him to bully you so he could feel better about himself.", "NTA. This guy's behavior was very poor. He seems to believe that people should work hard for the sake of working hard, rather than as a means to ends. he also seems to believe that a woman's natural place is to be the homemaker, and that it's unnatural for a man to take on that role. \n\nOP, you could have physically thrown him out of the front door of your home and I'd still say NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut since other people are, maybe be careful what info you share. \n\nI don\u2019t think those are your \u201cfriends\u201d.", "INFO:  Did your partner back you up?", "NTA.  You didn't put him down - you responded (far more pleasantly than most would) to him attempting to cut you down.  Excellent responses.", "NTA at all", "NTA.\n\nHe needed an actual put down, which you barely gave him.", "NTA.  Your true \"crime\" was not rising to the bait.", "NTA. If you're enjoying your work, life and relationship, then you are doing terrific.\n\nToo bad the other BF resents your situation - but that is his baggage.", "Why are doctors so condescending about everyone else\u2019s work? Especially 9-5, desk jobs? I see this in real life too. It\u2019s so annoying.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a wonderful life.", "This is nonsense. You\u2019ll care less about this stuff as you age. It means nothing.", "That line about fragile masculinity was perfect! OP deserves a round of applause for roasting this guy alive to the point he needed a minute. NTA in any way, shape or form.", ">green-eyed monster\n\nYeah. He really gives me \"misery loves company\" vibes. Like, he doesn't want his life to get better, he just wants OP's life to be worse.", "Idk if it\u2019s a red flag, it seems like he was doing a good job reacting on his own. If it were my husband and he were handing it I would have just silently chuckled to myself, watched everything go down, and tell him how funny his responses were later. Sure she should have his back with her friends but the post doesn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t.", "\u201cMy masculinity is NOT fragile you take it back right NOW!  I\u2019ll kill you!

It gives doctors a bad name and makes me not want to go to any now!", "Right?  Like, medical professionals are scandalously badly treated but that\u2019s not your fault, and if they want better treatment they have to demand it, not keep letting it slide and then bending over backward to offer more to management that doesn\u2019t care about them. These guys were sold a bill of goods about it being worth it because they\u2019ll be heroes and the pinnacle of society if they just take it. \n\nHe got triggered and tried to put you in your place.

In your own home. Nta", "Long hours made standard by a coke addicted [doctor](https://historydaily.org/cocaine-and-modern-medicine-a-twist-you-didnt-see-coming/7) back in the 1800s. Great example of how to live your life. Get hyped up so you can work more.", "I don't know how true it is, but I've heard it often repeated that bullies are drawn to the medical profession because of the level of power it gives them over their fellow man.", "I wouldn't be surprised, it makes sense. I mean, I knew that most doctors are egotistic. (For real, anyone who insists on being called Dr so-and-so and gets offended when they're called Mr or Mrs/Ms)\n\nAnd, they do go through a lot of schooling and even go through an abusive training period so I can understand them wanting to be respected but this guy takes it way too far thinking they should be treated like they are the beginning and the end all of everything! \n\nAnd of course, not all doctors are that way. I had a doctor that had everyone just call him Dr. Dave and acted very casually with his patients. So I feel guilty for bad-mouthing doctors in general like this but there are so few really good, unpretentious doctors around."]}
