They tend to have a condescending attitude towards other professions and always mention their long hours. You didn't put him down at all. He tried to put you down and failed then got embarrassed.\n\nWhere was your partner though? You are fully capable of standing up for yourself I'm sure but some support would have been nice.", "NTA. That is really rude behavior. It would be rude coming from a friend, let alone from a guest. I wouldn\u2019t invite them back. Also, are you hiring? Lol", "Not the asshole. Clearly this is a case of the other person not being able to understand your work and the balance that you can create with it.", "NTA\n\n\"she apologised but said I didn\u2019t have to put him down like that\" - fuck that he did that for himself, what an embarrassment of a man\n\ndid your partner not react to it? it was her friends that tried to put you down and she said nothing?...kinda a red flag", "NTA sounds like he\u2019s jealous and has some sort of fragile ego you are all good.", "NTA. Your partner's friend had no right to tell you you're an asshole for anything. All you did was play along and there wasn't a single personal slight towards her bf (except maybe implying that his masculinity was fragile, which it is). Sounds like he's just jealous that you make more than him and have a cushier life.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all he has some weird worldview, he sounds like he is insecure about his own masculinity and feel the need to put other men down. \n\nIf it works for you and your wife the way you live, so is it none of his business\n\nThe only one having to apologize is him for being a rude and obnoxious guest, please don\u2019t invite him again", "NTA.

Well played. The 'fragile masculinity' bit is just golden. I may hate you out of jealousy, but I respect your actions here.", "Haha what a jealous little man \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\nHe's jealous and was embarrassed that you have an easier life than him. Being a Doctor used to be a prestigious profession, with high earnings and a lot of power.  Now doctors are undervalued and overworked and it's a very difficult life. He's clearly not happy and was hoping to take you down a peg or two. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA at all! I love the way you responded!", "NTA, he was rude to you in your own home.", "NTA, that guy is insecure and toxic.", "NTA\nYou are fortunate to have a job you can handle, tackle all of your tasks and even have time to assist colleagues sometimes. Also you obviously have no commute to and from work (can\u2019t even admit how many hours mine was, ok 5 1/2 hours per day) so you can probably roll out of bed and begin your job. Sounds amazing to me! Your job sounds like you have a certain amount of work allocated to you and you are constantly crushing it. It\u2019s not an \u201chourly time based job\u201d probably. Lots of people just don\u2019t understand that this can exist in their normal world. You have found this situation that works for you, you make enough money, you have time to exercise, play some games (both relaxing for mental health) and still have time that you are spending cleaning, making dinner etc. which obviously makes less home type work for your partner which must make her happy. You obviously aren\u2019t living off of her, the guy just doesn\u2019t get it. The only thing I was bummed about was that your partner joked about you playing PlayStation most of the day. That\u2019s hurtful and also then puts you in the position of having to explain/defend yourself to some random (drunk) guy. You should have a talk about this with her and come up with better ways to describe how your job is working for you both.", "NTA lmaooo if i could play BG3 during work i would too! the guy's just jealous. good on you man, you and your partner seem to have a good life and i love it for y'all", "NTA. I wonder if he really understood what you do for work.", "NTA, seems to me that you handled that perfectly! He was trying to get a reaction and acted out further when he didn\u2019t get it. You didn\u2019t put him down at all.  This should be a huge red flag for your partner\u2019s friend!", "Defintely NTA.\n\nTo be honest i would also be jealous of your situation but i would also be first in line to congratulate you for having a great work/private life balance", "Fuck that guy think he can come into your house and talk down to you. NTA", "Wow - he was really rude to you in your own house.  That is bad guest behavior.  Good for you for keeping your temper.\n\nNTA"]}
