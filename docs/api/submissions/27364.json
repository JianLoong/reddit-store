It was your day and it wasn't a joke to you. If she can't understand that, then it's on her.\n\nShe could have kept the outfit and changed into it for the reception / afterparty.

Esh. You\u2019re ta for not making things clear. She\u2019s ta for standing her ground. There must have been a lot of stress leading up to this. Did this bother your husband as well? Or is it just you? Your relationship with your sister is compromised if you don\u2019t mend things soon. If you do open this up again with her be very careful to only share your feelings and not blame anything on her. She could have known better but she can\u2019t read your mind. She could have passed it by you first but wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up to you. You could have asked someone to go get her a dress for other pics.

Get it? Santa is *bringing* you the rings like they're gifts?!\"--people's jaws would have been on the floor with how rude and disrespectful that would have been. No one would have found it cute. Weddings with themed inspiration for formal attire and decor are normal and, unless they're explicitly over the top (a horror-themed wedding where everyone comes in costume, etc.), guests are generally expected to have the good sense to not take the theme too literally.\n\nI can't help but get the feeling that people fundamentally *get* the solemnity of a wedding (particularly an expensive formal one) more automatically when it's a hetero couple tying the knot.
