It was a small wedding with just our family and closest friends. My husband and I both love space, so we decided to have a space themed wedding. We had star decorations, a galaxy marble cake, and fairy lights. I even wore a tux with little white stars. My sister (32 F) was invited to be the ring bearer as she and I are very close. However, when she showed up at the wedding, she was wearing a Halloween costume of Saturn. She was literally dressed up like the planet. We made it very clear in our invitations that this wedding was strictly formal. My sister and I joke around a lot, so I laughed about it and asked her to get ready as the wedding was starting soon. But she fully planned to bring us the rings in her Halloween costume. She refused to change into a serious outfit, saying that our family would find it funny because Saturn has rings and she's the ring bearer. This was the most important day of my life, and I expected her to take it seriously, even though we often joke around. So I told her she could change or she could leave. She called me over dramatic and left.

It's a wedding, not a costume contest or prank show.", "What a bummer that she had the most epic, hilarious joke planned with being dressed up as the actual planet Saturn and then afterwards, completely ruined said joke with her bad attitude and blatant disregard for you + the dress code! If I was your sister and chosen as your ring bearer in a space themed wedding, I would have hilariously embodied Saturn as a joke but in a more classy, creative way that also complies with the formal dress code (i.e. wearing a formal dress + cute Saturn earrings, formal dress + fashionable waist belt to represent \u201cSaturn\u2019s ring\u201d, formal dress + bringing the ring on a cute pillow that is shaped like or has the planet Saturn on it, or, like many suggested here, wearing the costume in the beginning, get a few laughs in, then changing into a formal dress after for the ceremony).\n\nOP is NTA. The sister is TA when she refused to change into a formal dress, and for ruining this totally awesome joke with her drama and disrespect towards you. My pet peeve is when a person ruins a hilarious joke like this so I\u2019m particularly upset for you over this!", "NTA.\n\nIt's your day and you even made the guests aware of the dress code.

You\u2019d obviously still have every right to set the dress code of your own wedding, but if it\u2019s a well-intentioned but tone-deaf faux pas on her part I\u2019d say nobody here is an asshole.

Your sister is hilarious imo. Especially given you joke around a lot, and you didn\u2019t have a super-traditional wedding (fairy lights, white stars on your tux\u2026). She was probably right, your family would have found it funny. \n\nThat said it\u2019s your wedding. I\u2019m surprised once she realized you were against the costume that she walked off. I wonder if she didn\u2019t have a dress to wear in its place?\n\nPersonally I would have let her wear the costume to show everyone, maybe even to walk down the aisle with the rings - but told her it needed to come off for family photos.", "ESH her for refusing to change and you for not finding this hilarious enough to allow it.", "NTA- She called you over dramatic but chose to leave her brothers wedding rather than get dressed?!.

And then when I got to what your sister wore my heart sank for you. I\u2019m sorry she couldn\u2019t see how inappropriate that was.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding, I hope you have a long and happy marriage!", "NTA your wedding sounds beautiful!", "Agreed. Super funny to turn up early in it. Then you run off and change. Her thinking it's acceptable to be dressed in a Halloween costume at the wedding because it would be funny and bring *her* attention is nuts.", "But she could have had Saturn as a fascinator/hairpiece, still had the pun, but not made the wedding a joke.\n\nNTA", "NGL, I lost it at \"Because Saturn has rings,\" the idea had merit and would've been hilarious had she had permission... \n\nWhen in a wedding party/playing a substantial role in a wedding no matter what the theme is, if you're going to wear something that is scene stealing, attention grabbing, a joke or a costume or anything like that you run it by the people getting married.\n\n\nNo matter how close you are, your inside jokes... run it by the people hosting th party before making any major wardrobe or party decisions, better safe than sorry and it's just bad form to make any elaborate plans without consulting the ones throwing the event.

The invites stated formal, she did not dress formal, OP went lol funny but now change please, she went noOoO, OP went sis pls I don't want my wedding ceremony to be a joke - change or leave as its not happening, she left.", "People who like space have space theme. It doesn't have to be a pantomime though.", "She could have least asked..", "No Y T A for judging them for their wedding. The sister is TA for wanting to be \u201cfunny\u201d.", "Yes. We don't care about traditional gender roles.", "Op had little white stars on his tux. This is not old-style formality.\n\nSister came as an actual planet. How could anything be more on-theme than that?\n\nMales have a fairly uniform dress code. Women's fashions can be quite odd. This was just somewhat odder than typical.  I really don't see her participation ruining the wedding.\n\nSister probably should have run this by Op in advance, but I do agree, Op was being over dramatic. This would have added a memorable touch to the wedding.", "That's beside the point.  She knew what the expectations were... if she didn't have a formal dress then that's on her.  It's not an excuse for a formal wedding.", "Then NAH. She should\u2019ve checked with you beforehand and/or been prepared to change if you didn\u2019t like it, but what she did wasn\u2019t egregiously horrible.

But the people getting married didn't want that so obviously wouldn't want it as a memorable stand out. They wanted the the theme subtle and classy, not make a joke out of the ceremony. If you'd like it for your wedding go ahead but OP is entitled to stick to his wish of no thank you, formal attire please", "O I don\u2019t say it is any excuse whatsoever. She should have had the dress present. But maybe that is why she left and made some drama over it because her joke blew up in her face and she couldn\u2019t make it right because she didn\u2019t plan on it. Makes it worse if you\u2019d ask me.", "She became the asshole though when she refused to change and called him overdramatic for not wanting her to make a joke at his wedding.", "Thanks! Updated!", "The bot only counts the parent comments, not the rest of the thread", "We don't have any children in the family, and she was excited to do it. Also there were no bridesmaids as there was no bride lol", "So everyone who puts their judgment while responding to the top rated comment just...doesn't get counted? \ud83e\udd14", "She still could have been a grooms person.\n\n\nObviously she wasn\u2019t that excited to do it if she dressed in costume then left\u2026..", "I think only the singular very top comment, the one with the most upvotes counts. Not sure though", "That\u2019s my understanding, seems odd though doesn\u2019t it.", "Or she was SO excited she got hyped on her idea and couldn't fathom OP not loving it. There is no evidence to suggest she didn't want to be ring bearer. And if she didn't, she should've said so instead of sabotage. But I don't think she wanted to sabotage things, she wanted to be funny, and then for some reason couldn't get over herself or grasp it wasn't about her"]}
