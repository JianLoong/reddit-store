It was your day and it wasn't a joke to you. If she can't understand that, then it's on her.\n\nShe could have kept the outfit and changed into it for the reception / afterparty.

Your Sister is Definitely one of the Biggest AH I've read about on this Site!  How incredibly disrespectful, Rude and frankly cruel to treat you Wedding as a Joke?!

Esh. You\u2019re ta for not making things clear. She\u2019s ta for standing her ground. There must have been a lot of stress leading up to this. Did this bother your husband as well? Or is it just you? Your relationship with your sister is compromised if you don\u2019t mend things soon. If you do open this up again with her be very careful to only share your feelings and not blame anything on her. She could have known better but she can\u2019t read your mind. She could have passed it by you first but wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up to you. You could have asked someone to go get her a dress for other pics. But instead you didn\u2019t even have your sister in your final wedding even though you\u2019re close. So what\u2019s more important? Your sister being there or her dressing more appropriately? When there\u2019s a public display like this another option is to talk in private and say something like \u2018hey I really appreciate how funny this whole outfit is. It\u2019s just not what I expected. I want you to stay because you\u2019re important to me, we\u2019ll have to talk about this later. What size dress are you?

If you didn't want her there because of what she was wearing and she wouldn't change it doesn't make much sense to let her upstage you at your own wedding.
