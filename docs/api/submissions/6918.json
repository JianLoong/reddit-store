My wife (47f) has been a stay-at-home mom since our oldest B (16f) was born. We have three kids B(16f) P(15f) and C(14m). B and P share a bedroom and have since C was born.\u00a0\n\nWhen my wife and I bought our house it had an upstairs master and a first-floor master which we converted into my office. B\u2019s birthday was Friday, and she's been asking for her bedroom. B has been begging that we convert the office into her own room so she doesn\u2019t have to share a room with her sister and a bathroom with her siblings.\u00a0\n\nMy wife has been trying to convince me by saying we can move my desk to our bedroom since I barely use it. I\u2019ve been telling her I need the office in case of an emergency and I want to keep my work separate from the spaces I relax in. B got very upset by this and said I\u2019m denying her privacy and space of her own. I pointed out she does have her own space on her side of the bedroom. I also pointed out that she will be sharing a dorm with someone when she goes to college. so she will have lots of practice.\n\nB got very upset by this and said some classic teenager things like I\u2019m ruining her life and she hates me. B also said it\u2019s unfair C has his own room. I asked B if she\u2019d like to share a room with C instead and she said no.\u00a0\n\nMy wife thinks I\u2019m being selfish and that B and P are growing up and deserve to have their own spaces. My wife keeps telling me I\u2019m being unfair and acting like an ass I pointed out she doesn\u2019t have a job and doesn\u2019t know how important it is I have an office space.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being an ass but my wife and daughters insist I am. My mother agrees with me I need my own space to work.\u00a0\n\nAITA?\n\nClarifications: my office was converted to a first floor master by the previous owners of the house. It was originally a dining room. The room is a similar size to B and P\u2019s current bedroom but a little smaller due to the bathroom. \n\nMy daughters have a blackout curtain that covers their beds/desks that my wife made when the girls hit middle school. \n\nI use the office around 20-30 hours a month. I handle legal documents that need to be kept behind a locked door. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a basement we have an attic but the only way to access it is through a drop down ladder in the hallway.\n\nYes I did ask my mother for her outlook on this situation. My mom doesn\u2019t have any input on my relationship or life. But I do occasionally ask her for advice or her opinion on matters. My wife asks her mom for advice all the time and I have no problem with that.", "created_utc": 1673291028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107mrif/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_up_my_office_so_my/", "score": 5552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While two girls share one bedroom, and your son has his own room?\n\nIf that's the case, is there a way that you could make your office (the other master bedroom) into two bedrooms, and take the smallest bedroom as your home office? Is there a basement / other space of the house where you could have your home office?\n\nAlso, YTA for brining your mother into this and saying \"well my wife thinks it's unfair but my mommy is taking my side so it's ok!\"", "I think YTA here, for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, keeping an entire room you rarely use just on the off chance you need to take a call is a genuine waste of space. If you needed to use the office all the time during work hours it would be a different story - but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nSecondly, on that note, not wanting to have a desk you rarely use in your room (on the off chance you need to have some privacy during a work emergency) because you want to keep your work space separate\u2026 That\u2019s a bit rich when you\u2019re asking your two teenage, almost adult, daughters to share their space 100% of the time. It\u2019s a huge double standard. \n\nThirdly, I assume that your two youngest aren\u2019t sharing because they\u2019re different genders? It\u2019s pretty standard for the oldest to get first dibs on a room of their own, so if you can get past the weird gender segregation maybe P and C could share for a while. It\u2019s a raw deal for P, but if C has never shared he\u2019ll be totally unprepared for college - according to your logic, anyway. B has had ample practice.\n\nEdit: Please note last point is largely sarcastic. None of them should be sharing a room. If there\u2019s space available, it\u2019s inappropriate for *any* two teenagers to be sharing, regardless of gender. And I don\u2019t think even OP buys his bs comment about sharing being good practice for sharing a dorm in college.", "You're 49 and you're asking your mom's approval?  Really?

Telling your wife she doesn't have a job so she couldn't understand needing her own \"office\" space is fucked up. Your wife has the most important job. Raising kids is not easy.

That's selfish to hoard an entire room of the house, for what breaks down to an hour a day of use. When your daughter would use it every day. You must not know what it's like to spend the majority of your life in a shared space with someone. It can be suffocating. You don't have a safe space to unwind, to be alone. Your daughters having their own space and being happy in their home is worth more than your one hour of use. \n\n3. \"You'll be sharing a dorm with someone in college.\" Okay, she's been sharing her room her entire life. Does she not get a chance to experience her own space? This is a lame ass excuse to be a selfish ass hole. You're not doing this to prepare your child for life. you're doing it because you want your own space. \n\n4. Legal documents can be kept in a lock filing cabinet in your bedroom. Problem solved. \n\n5. Brining your mother into an issue with your household is wrong. Your mother has nothing to do with the decisions being made inside that home.
