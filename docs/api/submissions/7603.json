If your child is being a nuisance, get the fuck out.", "NTA\n\nKids cry. That\u2019s just how it is. Adults are their to help them process their emotions. If the kid is crying for more then five minutes the adult should remove them until they can be comforted. \n\nSpeaking as an Auntie who has left restaurants, museums, operas, movies, etc. till kiddos are feeling better.", "As a parent, I would always take my twins out of a public space if they were crying, to give them a moment to calm down, and then try again. It\u2019s only polite. NTA", "I say NTA. The attendant obviously said something to her because it was a noticeable annoyance and inconvenience. Kids can be hard to control, and if you ignore them it\u2019s impossible.", "NTA, I commend you for your bravery to go up and say something, Im sure everyone was thankful.", "NTA and not crazy.\n\nUseless parents on auto-pilot mode are the worst. If you can't take care of your kid or be aware of your surroundings, stay at home.", "Normally, as much as I can't stand the shrill sound of kids, I'd say that public spaces run the risk of experiencing that cause it's just the way it is, it's a public space that they paid to be in too. BUT, since she clearly made zero effort to do anything about it and just continued her conversation, I say NTA, and she sucks ass as a person.", "NTA. You were appropriate about it.", "NTA. I am a parent. Being in a space meant for quiet contemplation is a tough thing to attempt with a toddler, and I can\u2019t fault her for trying. But, I can absolutely fault her for having zero respect for the fact that she\u2019s messing that general environment up for everyone else there with no attempt to address it. She wasn\u2019t stuck on an airplane with a toddler having a meltdown, she was choosing to let her child scream endlessly in a museum she could temporarily walk out of at any time. Total AH.", "NTA\n\nNo, it's not the kid's fault that they're bored out of their minds.  But the **parent** should not be bringing their toddler somewhere like that, simply because they can't be bothered to get a babysitter.\n\nI consider that completely selfish and irresponsible behavior on the part of the parent.  Parents need to make sacrifices.  One of them is \"I can't go somewhere my kid will be bored out of their minds/is not kid friendly unless I pay a babysitter to watch my kid.\"", "NTA because according to you she wasn\u2019t even trying to pacify her child.  Had she been doing everything she could to stop the the then yes, you would have been the asshole.  When I\u2019m somewhere and a baby is crying and mom can\u2019t pacify the child, I usually talk to the baby and make faces and that helps.\n\nBut if mom is ignoring the kid then you had every right to complain to the attendant.  I\u2019m so often surprised at the places people think are appropriate for toddlers.", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand crying children disturbing the peace. Specially when the mom is not trying to calm the child.", "NTA unless this was a children\u2019s museum, which isn\u2019t what it sounds like. Kids crying in public is sometimes unavoidable, but it\u2019s a bit rude to just let it happen instead of removing the kid.", "NTA not the childs fault but deff the adults fault.", "NTA. I have 2 kids and was all ready to come in here and call you TA, because yeah, there\u2019s not a button you can push to make them stop crying. \n\nBut there is a difference between being annoyed by a mother in line at CVS trying to soothe her ear infected kid while waiting for an antibiotic prescription (someone gave me a nasty look and I shot back \u201coh I\u2019m sorry; is this bothering you? It\u2019s super relaxing for me!\u201d in a snotty voice.) and a mother ignoring her crying child in a leisure setting like a museum, coffee shop, etc.", "NTA - Especially in those big museums?  Sound ECHO and a screaming kid would have me wanting to climb the walls.  That was highly inconsiderate of the mother to just ignore her screaming kid and act like everyone else should just have to put up with it.", "As a mother, NTA, you did it politely and not in a child hating way, letting your child scream bc you can\u2019t be bothered dealing with baby, look it get it as a mother, but tend to your child. As a person that also uses a public space and a mother, I\u2019d be the same if someone else was being a loud mouth and disturbing my child in a quiet space. As for reacting the way she did when you were polite, I don\u2019t like to judge other mums. Sometimes we have bad days, but you didn\u2019t scrutinise her. It\u2019s entitled to do nothing about it in a quiet space, like even try, I\u2019m sure if she tried and she was struggling you wouldn\u2019t have approached the guard because it would be made obvious that she\u2019s trying. Sometimes these things happen, you did not tell off her child or cross any boundaries per se", "NTA", "I definitely understand the optics of a large male confronting women with kids, so I felt it was best left up to the staff who is probably better equipped to have a polite conversation with her.", "Wasn\u2019t worth it to engage as she was calling me a male Karen and several other awesome names. What\u2019s wild is I wasn\u2019t even rude about it I just asked if the attendant could maybe suggest she goes outside for a few mins till the child calms down.", "I just feel a museum is the one place I\u2019d mention something. The zoo. Target. Any store I shut my mouth as I don\u2019t know the scenario. But to not even care just drove me nuts as a paying customer to a quiet museum.", "Thanks. Definitely difficult to not engage with adrenaline going from name calling but I had nothing against her just wanted to enjoy what I paid for. Crying kids I pay zero attention to in 99% of public spaces as I get it some kids just need to cry it out, but self awareness in a museum I thought would be common sense.", "For sure kids cry. And 99% of the time I don\u2019t even give it a second thought as who am I to judge / parent someone else\u2019s child. But a paying indoor experience I felt warranted a minor comment / suggestion by the museum staff vs me directly engaging", "Didn\u2019t think a 6\u20195 male coming up to 2 small women asking one to please quiet her child / or bring them outside would have gone over well. Left it to the staff. But to each their own. Had I directly engaged I\u2019d probably be on another subreddit here as a terrible shovenistic AH confronting poor mothers.", "Nope, it's not OP's place to police the environment. It's entirely appropriate to call the owner/manager/staff to deal with issues like this.", "lol bruh, this is not it", "If it had been any other setting, I probably would\u2019ve kept quiet. As crying kids happen, it\u2019s life. But a museum that people pay money to get into should entitled them to a reasonably quiet visit. Especially with zero attempt on her part to disengage the kid.", "Yeah I figured an indirect complaint was better as I don\u2019t like to be that person .. but she did nothing for about 10 solid minutes of crying and pretty much everyone there was being affected negatively. It\u2019s not like we were at Disneyland where you just ignore it and walk on, we were all in the same enclosed space with zero intervention as if it was totally OK behavior \ud83d\ude14", "Everyone but the lady in question was definitely relieved. Most of the people in my town visiting the museums at balboa park come from far away. So to be able to enjoy a quiet space to interpret art isn\u2019t an unreasonable ask (or so I thought)", "This. The right approach was taken so NTA.", "Yes! NTA it is a parent's responsibility to take care of their kid and to make sure they are not disturbing others.", "To be honest, even if she was holding the child or trying any type of method I probably would\u2019ve shut up and chalked it up to her kid having a bad day. But she literally was just talking over the crying kid to her friend. They could\u2019ve walked outside and pushed the strollers on any number of walking paths at Balboa Park until it quieted down. After we were leaving, another staff said I wasn\u2019t the first complaint, simply the one that caused them to intervene. Just wasn\u2019t sure if it was my right to \u201cgo to the staff\u201d. As I know crying kids are touchy subjects (99% of which I ignore as who am I to judge)", "Yeah no attempts were made. I totally get toddlers cry, but when you now just amplify your own voice over the kids and ruin everyone\u2019s indoor experience it\u2019s just beyond frustrating. Have some self awareness \ud83d\ude16.", "It was an art museum, definitely not a kid one. And I get kids cry, but uninterrupted for several minutes and no attempt to intervene finally pushed me over the edge as we couldn\u2019t even hear ourselves think.", "I would never shame a crying kid in any public setting like a store or hell even the zoo / Disneyland / a park. I just mind my business. But a little self awareness in a quiet museum goes a long way.", "And it was a medium sized art one with sound echoing throughout the entire space :/ made it impossible to get away from no matter what part I went to.", "Everyone has bad days for sure. I just felt like it was better left to the staff than me, trying to directly engage a woman on her child\u2019s behavior as that could\u2019ve gone wrong quite quickly. Ultimately I had zero issues with her or the child, I just wish she would take them outside for a few minutes and let other people enjoy a museum they paid money for.", "You made the right choice regardless of optics; you're a guest there, its staff's job to make sure everyone is having a good experience, and you brought something to their attention and they fixed it.  There's no reason for anyone, male or female big or small, to have to fix these problems themselves in a place they're paying to enjoy.", "You did the right thing. Definitely would have been accused of chauvinism. NTA", "So you didn\u2019t think it would go well and chose to make someone else do it for you? That would make you a coward.", "It absolutely isn't but there's always that one person that seems completely oblivious to the world around them.", "Yes, it\u2019s the sheer lack of caring about others that she showed that\u2019s the real issue here. I\u2019m sure everyone there was grateful that you said something. \n\nIt\u2019s also even worse knowing this was at Balboa Park. I was imagining it at some very urban museum where outside was dirty/noisy/unpleasant. Very much not the case where you were!", "Yeah definitely NTA. I would\u2019ve done a quick scoop and run if one of mine started wailing in an art museum. Most people don\u2019t even speak above a whisper.", "Nope, I\u2019m completely with you. Some people just think children shouldn\u2019t like, exist in public (parks, public transportation, otherwise noisy family type restaurants) and those people annoy the shit out of me so I think they should be the ones to stay home. But if it\u2019s a place where there is any expectation of quiet, leave your kid home, or if you do have to take them, remove them the minute they go higher than a reasonable level of volume.", "Yeah, and with a $20 cover fee, that would make for a miserable trip that you paid money to enjoy something.  Her inaction made it unenjoyable for e everyone there, so it's good you weren't afraid to be the one to step on toes and ask a staff member to address the issue, even if it means they asked the mother to step out, you did the right thing.  \n\nDon't worry about one entitled parent calling you an AH.  This sounds like it does belong on the r/entitledparents subreddit.  LOL", "No you absolutely made the right decision contacting staff. It\u2019s really not for you to go up to her and be an authority and as I said, you seem like if she was actively trying and struggling you wouldn\u2019t have said anything at all. It\u2019s just one of those things.", "NTA. You\u2019re not crazy. No one should have to tolerate a crying kid at a museum. If the kid can\u2019t be quiet, the kid needs to not be there.", "NTA. People pay to enjoy their time. It's not like a plane or bus (where people are also paying, but they're paying to get from point A to point B). She was quite rude to just ignore the kid and make everyone else deal with it.", "NTA\n\nParent of two here and there's no way i could just blatantly ignore it if my 2 year old was crying nonstop, especially somewhere crowded that's indoors. I would, and have done in the past, take her outside and soothe her until she's happy again.", "NTA. When my kids cried in public, I would try to soothe them. If that didn\u2019t work, we\u2019d leave. I understand kids will cry in public. I also tried to avoid outings around meals and nap times. \n\nI can ignore it if an effort is being made by their parent or other family members. If there\u2019s no effort, I can\u2019t. This woman just didn\u2019t care. \n\nYou wanted to enjoy your time with your friends. You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. There\u2019s no off button on a toddler\u2019s tantrum, but she should have stepped outside. An art museum is not the place for screaming children. You handled it well not starting an argument with her.\n\nAs a side note, I do have to argue with the general consensus that children shouldn\u2019t be brought to museums. The same people will say that kids today are uncultured and unable to behave in public and spend too much time in front of the tv. Exposing children to these kinds of places is how they learn. But when they are disturbing the other patrons from more than a minute or two it is the parent\u2019s responsibility to leave.", "I'm sorry, Miss, would you please repeat that? I can't hear you over the screaming kid. What? I'm sorry, you're gonna need to get the kid to quit crying so I can properly hear you bitch at me.  \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Nta. She wasn\u2019t even trying to figure out what her kid needed. This was a museum, not a park.", "NTA, ignoring the noise issue, it's also really distressing to see a kid sob hysterically for a long time with no comforting. It was rude and it was bad parenting.", "NTA. People with young children need to not bring them places that affect others enjoyment if they can't keep their kids quiet.", "NTA  kids and babies cry, fact of life but there's a point where you need to take the child out to calm it.", "Yeah\n\n\nToddlers can cry and scream because they are learning to cope with emotions, what is your excuse? If you're old enough to bitch someone out for incorrectly parenting a child,  you are old enough to shut the hell up when a child is crying. If you don't like noise, get headphones. If you feel like you're entitled to demand shit from someone with a young child, you're entitled to deal with consequences. \n\n\nI guess two kids cried at the museum and only one child got berated and that was the one under 5. Children don't owe you shit, parents don't owe you shit, and the fact that you feel like you can even comment on a kid crying and whine when she didn't immediately comply is insane. Your existence doesn't mean everyone has to ensure you have the best possible experience at all times. And indirectly?! You were a coward, got called out for being a dick and still wondering if she was an asshole?! \ud83e\udd23", "nta", "I had a kid pitch a fit in a museum once. As we were hustling the stroller towards the door, a woman took it upon herself to stand between us and the door and shush us.", "Plus museums have bare floors, nothing to dampen sounds\u2026 a crying kid would sound even louder.", "Yeah for sure most places I ignore as it\u2019s not my place to mention anything. At the zoo the other day this kid was screeching for what had to be 10-15 mins straight while I was in the sky bucket line\u2026 didn\u2019t say a word. But when I\u2019m inside a small confined space I expect others to have self awareness :/", "That\u2019s all I expected (and everyone else there too). Just some type of effort to calm it or remove herself from the space till her kid gained its composure.", "Thank you. Whenever I have my nieces or nephews if they start acting out beyond my control I just leave wherever we are till they chill out. Luckily they\u2019re well parented by my sisters so that\u2019s only happened a grand total of 2 times.", "Yeah I have zero issue with kids being literally anywhere. Just there\u2019s a few places they should be decently behaved and when acting out maybe walk outside for 5 mins versus ignoring it in a small confined space.", "Yeah I get letting them cry it out in a home or if they\u2019re sick or what not but in a museum I felt it takes 5 seconds to be self aware look around and maybe walk outside till the child is done / or you can calm it down", "I agree that the OP is NTA here, but your saying parents with young toddlers should just always stay home? Toddlers will cry at some point, you can't always stop them from crying. \nThe lady in this scenario should have removed her child from the situation, but there is nothing wrong with bringing toddlers places.", "Yeah that\u2019s ridiculous. You were doing the right thing by exiting for a moment to regain composure. Some people just suck.", "Oh man, Balboa Park? There's PLENTY of places she could have taken the kid and her friend to wait out the crying. Some museums near me don't have a lot of outdoor space, but Balboa Park is top tier museum space.", "OP should have probably called the cops, right?", "I feel you. My kids are older now, but when they were little I did my best to limit how much they ruined other people's experiences. But the people who act like children just should sprout into existence as fully formed humans with adult manners drive me crazy. \n\nI was once at dinner with my MIL and my three kids. It was a seafood restaurant attached to a fish market. Expensive, but not particularly quiet or fancy. The kids were actually really well behaved all through the meal, but by the time my older two were finishing up and asking for dessert, the youngest was done sitting still. He was just under two. So I left grandma with the older two and took the little guy out to the market area and let him wander around, following very closely to make sure he didn't cause any real trouble. \n\nSome guy walked past and said over his shoulder \"Babysitters exist for a reason\" and just kept walking. I was furious. He didn't even have the guts to look at me or give me a chance to respond. Just a hit and run judgement. The reality was that a babysitter would have defeated the purpose of the evening, since the point was to spend an evening with grandma. And there were some issues going on with my brother in law that made dinner at her home difficult. And we purposefully went to a place that had a kids menu and wasn't a fancy ambiance type place. It was just so odd, too, because my kids had been super well behaved. No crying or throwing food or making a fuss or whining. Just a family eating dinner and talking and having a nice time. I don't know how we even managed to upset that man.", "\"HEY! The zoo's \\*over there\\*!\"  \n\n\nNTA", "And it has a ton of outdoor areas--gardens and just open space--where mom can let the kids rampage while enjoying a local SD craft beer.", "Bingo", "And at the zoo I\u2019m totally cool with loud kids / expect it even. Same with any outdoor area I really just ignore it."]}
