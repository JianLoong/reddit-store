By the time they finished, we had to return the gowns and go home. I feel like my graduation was taken over by him and the attention was diverted to him when it was my graduation day.

Your mom and brother were behaving poorly. \n\nCongratulations on graduating, and well done with all your hard work!", "NTA. Your mother was very unfair to you. Your brother will have his real graduation next year. \n\nI\u2019m surprised that your brother embraced the fake graduation. In his shoes, I\u2019d have found it embarrassing. Is it usual for him to try to usurp attention on other people\u2019s special occasions?", "I never said he was dumb nor do I think he is dumb, he just struggled academically.", "How was it ruined? You gave up what, 20 minutes of attention? Why focus on that and enjoy what you have accomplished.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. However, maybe don\u2019t blow up on your family too hard. Your brother struggled with school and took a long time to finish. But it sounds like he did finally finish even though be wasn\u2019t able to be in this graduation ceremony. Your mom is allowed to be happy for both of you. And your brother is allowed to be proud of himself. They didn\u2019t handle it well - they for sure should have let your have your moment - but it\u2019s not the crime of the century. Also, your brother isn\u2019t gaslighting you; he thought you were being selfish and you disagree.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Same for when OP has her 1st child.  Is mom going to want brother to get dressed in a hospital gown and get into a birthing bed with messed up hair holding the baby?  \n\nOP should make a really bad photo copy of her degree with his name a hopeful degree on it  and frame it for him \"so mom can take pictures of that too.\"  I would be all about how you want to support him and how it may be the only way he gets a degree at all.", "OP should return the favor on her brother\u2019s graduation day. Demand he take off his cap and gown so she can take pictures in them.", "Thank you! It feels really reassuring that I wasnt being crazy and dramatic about it.", "I can say from my own perspective, there is a lot of daily focus on my sister and quite frankly anyone and anything that isn\u2019t me. Important occasions like graduation almost felt like a measuring stick for me - could my parents manage to put me first on a day that is definitely about me? Can they fake it to at least match what I see all my friends getting from their families? Well they couldn\u2019t. And it does feel like a blow. Like that extra proof that confirms that you aren\u2019t really cared for and wont ever get what you want. Three graduations - high school, university, law school. Not a single one could they keep it together and focus on me. It hurts and it\u2019s not about the graduation really. It\u2019s the meaning behind it.", "I\u2019m curious about whether or not OP\u2019s mom and brother intend to plaster his social media with \u201cgraduation\u201d photos in front of the university logo to give the impression that he did his full course there.", "You get it.", "They did that\ud83d\ude2d", "All the scapegoats get it, OP. We get it and we care. Your mom and brother are trash. He should be deeply ashamed of himself for going along with it at all, let alone feeling justified. Your mother is a lost cause, and I am sorry for any pain that causes. If you haven't checked them out yet, two good subs that may help: r/raisedbynarcissists and r/raisedbyborderlines   \n\n\nI think you'll find some community there. Meanwhile, go forth and shine so bright that detractors are burned to ash by your brilliance. Melt the wax of their wings and let gravity and hubris reacquaint them with the ground."]}
