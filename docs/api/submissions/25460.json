By the time they finished, we had to return the gowns and go home. I feel like my graduation was taken over by him and the attention was diverted to him when it was my graduation day.

Your mom and brother were behaving poorly. \n\nCongratulations on graduating, and well done with all your hard work!", "NTA. Your mother was very unfair to you. Your brother will have his real graduation next year. \n\nI\u2019m surprised that your brother embraced the fake graduation. In his shoes, I\u2019d have found it embarrassing. Is it usual for him to try to usurp attention on other people\u2019s special occasions?", "I never said he was dumb nor do I think he is dumb, he just struggled academically.", "How was it ruined? You gave up what, 20 minutes of attention? Why focus on that and enjoy what you have accomplished.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. However, maybe don\u2019t blow up on your family too hard. Your brother struggled with school and took a long time to finish. But it sounds like he did finally finish even though be wasn\u2019t able to be in this graduation ceremony. Your mom is allowed to be happy for both of you. And your brother is allowed to be proud of himself. They didn\u2019t handle it well - they for sure should have let your have your moment - but it\u2019s not the crime of the century. Also, your brother isn\u2019t gaslighting you; he thought you were being selfish and you disagree.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Same for when OP has her 1st child.  Is mom going to want brother to get dressed in a hospital gown and get into a birthing bed with messed up hair holding the baby?  \n\nOP should make a really bad photo copy of her degree with his name a hopeful degree on it  and frame it for him \"so mom can take pictures of that too.\"  I would be all about how you want to support him and how it may be the only way he gets a degree at all.", "OP should return the favor on her brother\u2019s graduation day. Demand he take off his cap and gown so she can take pictures in them.", "Thank you! It feels really reassuring that I wasnt being crazy and dramatic about it.", "I can say from my own perspective, there is a lot of daily focus on my sister and quite frankly anyone and anything that isn\u2019t me. Important occasions like graduation almost felt like a measuring stick for me - could my parents manage to put me first on a day that is definitely about me? Can they fake it to at least match what I see all my friends getting from their families? Well they couldn\u2019t. And it does feel like a blow. Like that extra proof that confirms that you aren\u2019t really cared for and wont ever get what you want. Three graduations - high school, university, law school. Not a single one could they keep it together and focus on me. It hurts and it\u2019s not about the graduation really. It\u2019s the meaning behind it.", "I\u2019m curious about whether or not OP\u2019s mom and brother intend to plaster his social media with \u201cgraduation\u201d photos in front of the university logo to give the impression that he did his full course there.", "You get it.", "They did that\ud83d\ude2d", "All the scapegoats get it, OP. We get it and we care. Your mom and brother are trash. He should be deeply ashamed of himself for going along with it at all, let alone feeling justified. Your mother is a lost cause, and I am sorry for any pain that causes. If you haven't checked them out yet, two good subs that may help: r/raisedbynarcissists and r/raisedbyborderlines   \n\n\nI think you'll find some community there. Meanwhile, go forth and shine so bright that detractors are burned to ash by your brilliance. Melt the wax of their wings and let gravity and hubris reacquaint them with the ground.", "Respond to the facebook/instagram posts with a comment like \u201cWow i thought that was next year, I don\u2019t remember seeing [brothers name] in graduation!\u201d", "NTA he\u2019s not graduating. He doesn\u2019t have the smarts.  This event would make me go low contact with mother. She obviously loves him more than you and you will always be second best to him.  Go low contact with them.   Otherwise you will always be humiliated.", "Yea, OP need to go low to no contact with her.", "Congratulations!  It is great achievement. Now leave the house and go low to no contact with your family. They will always be an Al stress around your neck. You are not loved like the brother is.", "That explains quite a bit. \n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if treating your graduation as your brother\u2019s special day is your mother\u2019s way of shielding him from the fact that, despite being six years younger, you graduated before he did.", "As a fellow \"good\" sibling who's parents pushed them aside for their \"struggling\" sibling I feel you OP.\n\nDefinitely NTA, your mom was probably thinking about how bad your brother would feel seeing you graduate and didn't bother thinking about you. I just pointed it out to my brother if ever gave me shit \"did you enjoy my graduation? It was so thoughtful of mom to make sure you didn't feel left out since you might never get the chance yourself\"", "Yeah, OP, focus on the **real** AH here. Your brother is merely an opportunistic AH. Your mum is a premeditating AH who raised her kid to be an entitled AH.", "I would\u2019ve been so embarrassed if I was the brother. Oh my god", "Or - \"*What a fantastic day! So much fun to have my family there, and love how my fun brother looks wonderfully goofy posing in MY robe and cap! Hey Bro! Ima do the same at your graduation!*", "Congratulations on your graduation, OP! And of course you are **NTA.**\n\nMy parents thwarted my every attempt to go to college - giving my car to my brother, forcing me in a car to go places and miss exams, (pre cell phone days) and even mocked me to my face and in public about I stupid I was to think I could pass courses, much less graduate college.  \n\nEnded up getting AA in my 40s and my BA at 50 and though my husband and friends couldn't have been prouder, my parents couldn't bring themselves to acknowledge it. At. All.   No biggie, and I never expected them to.\n\nThen my convicted felon brother, while in prison, was able to take courses and get credit from a very well known and respected university - bonus - inmates in the course got to have their pictures in the yearbook! Parents bought one and carried that damn thing EVERYWHERE they went bragging about it. They never said he was in prison, just that he's been attending this major uni and studying too hard to have time to make it to church or family events. \n\nHubby and me laughed every time we thought about wondering if people noticed that some of those students looked like they hadn't seen sunshine in who knows when and stared at the camera like a mug shot. \n\nYour bro knows he faked it. Your mom knows he faked it. And lots of other people I'm sure know that YOU are the REAL DEAL!", "Put up a post saying that your brother and mother failed math.  Because his grad is next year.", "NTA - congratulations on your graduation!", "NTA 100%", "NTA I have a sneaking feeling this is part of a lifetime pattern of behavior from your mom. \n\nCan he even graduate from your university? Mine had requirements on certain classes and amount of hours done there to graduate to keep people from going to a \"lesser\" school then slipping in to get a degree at the end with their name on it.", "write his name over hers in crayon...", "I think one day your gonna have to make the hard choice to cut your brother off. Possibly your parents as well. Be proud of your accomplishments. Let your mother know that was the last time you'll let her demean you for your brother.", "NTA. Tell him you hope he one day figures out why he was wrong. Hopefully, it wont take 9 years.", "They ruined your graduation, NTAH.", "Why did you agree to let him have your gown and hat? Stand up for yourself, tell them they\u2019re being ridiculous, he took ONE class there - what was the deal with wanting pics?  There are times when hissy fits are perfectly appropriate.", "I was wondering the same thing. Highjacking your graduation to save face isn't normal behavior. The fact that he's been at school so long means someone is paying for it. It's probably op's mom. \n\nNTA"]}
