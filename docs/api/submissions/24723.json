{"id": 24723, "submission_id": "15s3mpo", "title": "AITA for telling my husband to not eat me and my daughter\u2019s cookies?", "selftext": "My daughter is turning 7 in 2 days and me and her both have a gluten intolerance. Because my daughter hates the texture of cake and she doesn\u2019t eat it I decided I would make her her favorite store bought cookies that are gluten free. We don\u2019t have them often since they are expensive so it would be just as special. Then I would just get Walmart cupcakes for the rest of the family. I would have made the cake and cookies from scratch but I really am not good at baking so this was for the better.\n\nSo this morning I go to Walmart and get the cookies because my daughter likes cold cookies (idk why??) I also decide it would be better to wait on the cake so I can order ahead and it can say happy birthday on it or whatever.  I get home and put the cookies in the fridge so I can do a quick laundry rotation and in the middle of folding a load I get a work call. Apparently an ultrasound needs fixed and the newbie who was an intern last year needs help. I get that done and return home around 4. I go to get the cookies out of the fridge and someone ate 3 of the dough (it was safe to eat so that\u2019s not a huge deal) I\u2019m like okay that\u2019s fine I\u2019ll just bake the 9 left. \n\nAfter i bake them I move them to the garage fridge and I start to make dinner. My husband who was off work early goes to pick up my daughter from her friend\u2019s house. On his way out he opens the fridge, I hear it but don\u2019t really think about it. When he comes back we all eat dinner in the living room. A few hours later we put my daughter to bed. He then goes into the fridge and comes back with a cookie. I tell him that those are for me and our daughter since they are gluten free and we will be waiting to eat them on her birthday. He gets huffy about how I didn\u2019t buy any for him and I explain that I will be getting everyone else a cake but I will be getting it the morning of the party. He tells me we don\u2019t need that many, and he\u2019s right, we didn\u2019t need 12 but now there are only 7 so I can\u2019t even give any to her friends that might feel left out because she has a different snack. \n\nHe says I\u2019m being selfish but I just want her to have a fun birthday where she can have a sweet snack without getting a bad stomach ache. Am I the a-hole?\n\n\nEdit INFO: I told him my plan and he knows the brand of cookies by heart because whenever we go to the store my daughter points them out. I assumed he knew but maybe there was miscommunication.\n\nAlso we cannot buy more.\n\nAnother info addition: he isn\u2019t usually like this and there was a recent loss in our family we have all been hit like a train because we were very close to them. I have resolved this by making some cookies that some lovely people in the comments have helped me with. We are all good now and he apologized, I did too. You have all been very helpful and I\u2019ll put an update on if my daughter likes the cookies!", "created_utc": 1692130348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15s3mpo/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_not_eat_me_and_my/", "score": 792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gf or not. \nAs I said, he should definitely replace them because its not fair to remive the option from his wife and daughter ( even if it was an accident), but he shouldn't be banned from gluten free items just because he also has the ability to eat other things. He just needs to be considerate when he does.", "So it sounds like since he made the mistake, he needs to figure it out so everybody has enough.
