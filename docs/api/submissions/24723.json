{"id": 24723, "submission_id": "15s3mpo", "title": "AITA for telling my husband to not eat me and my daughter\u2019s cookies?", "selftext": "My daughter is turning 7 in 2 days and me and her both have a gluten intolerance. Because my daughter hates the texture of cake and she doesn\u2019t eat it I decided I would make her her favorite store bought cookies that are gluten free. We don\u2019t have them often since they are expensive so it would be just as special. Then I would just get Walmart cupcakes for the rest of the family. I would have made the cake and cookies from scratch but I really am not good at baking so this was for the better.\n\nSo this morning I go to Walmart and get the cookies because my daughter likes cold cookies (idk why??) I also decide it would be better to wait on the cake so I can order ahead and it can say happy birthday on it or whatever.  I get home and put the cookies in the fridge so I can do a quick laundry rotation and in the middle of folding a load I get a work call. Apparently an ultrasound needs fixed and the newbie who was an intern last year needs help. I get that done and return home around 4. I go to get the cookies out of the fridge and someone ate 3 of the dough (it was safe to eat so that\u2019s not a huge deal) I\u2019m like okay that\u2019s fine I\u2019ll just bake the 9 left. \n\nAfter i bake them I move them to the garage fridge and I start to make dinner. My husband who was off work early goes to pick up my daughter from her friend\u2019s house. On his way out he opens the fridge, I hear it but don\u2019t really think about it. When he comes back we all eat dinner in the living room. A few hours later we put my daughter to bed. He then goes into the fridge and comes back with a cookie. I tell him that those are for me and our daughter since they are gluten free and we will be waiting to eat them on her birthday. He gets huffy about how I didn\u2019t buy any for him and I explain that I will be getting everyone else a cake but I will be getting it the morning of the party. He tells me we don\u2019t need that many, and he\u2019s right, we didn\u2019t need 12 but now there are only 7 so I can\u2019t even give any to her friends that might feel left out because she has a different snack. \n\nHe says I\u2019m being selfish but I just want her to have a fun birthday where she can have a sweet snack without getting a bad stomach ache.

For the love of all that is holy, leave me some GF cookies and pizza. It's all I have.", "Your husband is acting like a child. NTA", "NTA. The cookies were for the party, not any time cookies. And furthermore, they were cookies that the two of you *can* eat, whereas your husband can eat anything. He should have chosen something else to snack on.", "NTA. Just tell him to eat the rest and buy her a new pack before the party. No biggie.\n\nBut, your husband is being childish. As soon as you let him know it was for the party, the reasonable answer she have been my bad. Also, greedy much? Who eats 5 out of 12 \"cookie dough patties\" in one day. A bit selfish, right?", "NTA - you made the cookies, explained the reasons, and he was hangry and had a mini-tantrum. You\u2019re not holding him hostage from going out and getting his own cookies!", "He is a grown man.  He can buy or make his own cookies.\n\nNTA", "My little one has a gluten allergy as well. I don't touch anything that she CAN eat. She's already limited to her options so why would I limit what she can have?\n\nNTA.", "Is he your husband or a baby? He can't live a day without eating multiple cookies? \nNTA, but you don't have a cookie problem, you have a husband problem. \nTell him he can get himself snacks if he needs them so bad and make sure to mark cookies as \"don't eat\" next time you put them in a fridge", "NTA. He ate 5 cookies in one day! If you didn\u2019t say anything, they would be gone by the next day! He is acting inconsiderate and selfish. He better pay for a new box when he goes to pick up the cake for you.", "NTA\n\n\n\nHe is a big ass about this", "I recommend good communication in the future, and put a note on them to remind. \"GF, do not touch.\" \"GF for the party, don't touch.\" Something like that. I get how he would be defensive. But even more, I get how she needs special food. HOWEVER, I don't think you should plan on feeding her cookies to her friends. Don't even offer them. They get cupcakes or grandma's cookies or whatever. Special expensive GF cookies can be reserved for the birthday girl. She should get to eat them for a few days. \n\nWhen my son had a friend with celiac attend his birthday party, I made her GF peanut butter cookies, while everyone else ate ice cream cake. \n\nP.S. Here's the amazing gf peanut butter cookie recipe. Easiest thing ever to make: 2 cups Peanut butter, 2 cups sugar, 2 eggs, 1 cup chocolate chips. Mix, bake in spoonfuls for about 8 minutes in a 350 oven.", "NTA. Also sorry, it sounds like your daughter might be more mature than your husband.", "NTA but this seems like it could\u2019ve been about 3-4 sentences and isn\u2019t tough to resolve (tell hubby he has to go out and buy more).", "NTA, Hubs is a glutton and needs to get his ass to the store to replace them", "NTA\n\nHe says YOU\u2019RE being selfish when HE\u2019S eaten 5/12 of someone else\u2019s cookies??\n\nSend him to get more.", "NTA, but you should have told him beforehand.", "NTA, make cookies for everyone right now!!", "YTA for not letting him eat you, just enjoy it! \n\nHe\u2019s TA for eating his daughter\u2019s special GF/bd-cookies. \n\nNow you\u2019re NTA for telling him \u201cto not eat my cookies\u201d\n\n\ud83e\uddcc", "Did he know prior that they were for that purpose?  Why can't he also have gluten free cookies? Instead of telling him not to eat them, why not ask him to replace them so his mistake doesn't cause an extra errand for you. \nNo harm, no foul. \n\nIt's also not a big deal if there's few extra cupcake or cookies.", "Info: was there any other cheap cookie thing you could have brought your husband? He doesn't need gluten free, so surely there's options. The whole house smells like cookie when you bake. Can't blame husband for getting the munchies.", "[removed]", "NTA your husband is being inconsiderate after you explained the issue.", "INFO: Did he know these cookies are for a restricted diet? Labeling or telling him ahead of time...is this a thing?", "NTA and your husband is acting like an absolute child.", "This is very fair. I remember having pizza with friends and they want to \u201ctry\u201d my personal pan cauliflower crust for various reasons. \u201cI might start a diet if it\u2019s just as good as real pizza\u201d like 1st of all THEN BUY YOUR OWN and 2nd of all IT IS REAL PIZZA!! Glad you feel for me!", "Ughhh that happens to me at work when we have seasonal 'meals'. I give them my allergy list and somehow everything comes without labels, so I have no idea what's safe for me to eat. Then they're like oh you can have these crisps, sweets and fruit. \n\nOr I tell them specifically what I want and when it comes to the event on my plate is not what I wanted and has at least 2 allergens on it!", "At our Christmas party last year we ordered a pizza specially for someone who couldn't eat the other ones. It wasn't like gluten free or anything but she explained to me that she has food avoidance issues because of textures and stuff. I completely understand, I have some textured I avoid aswell. So when it came time to eat we very politely announced \"please don't eat D's pizza, it's the only one she can eat\"  Now we all knew not eat her pizza because we're not assholes. Only am asshole would continue to consume the food after being informed it's for another individual.", "We can\u2019t buy a new pack without cutting a different party snack. They are quite expensive and we have a low budget.", "Seriously he\u2019s calling OP selfish when he ate nearly half them himself and knows they can\u2019t have gluten and are on a budget.", "I mean it\u2019s not even because they were gluten free it was just that these were PARTY cookies not EVERYDAY SNACK cookies yk? On the day of the party he would have other cookies and even cake that he could eat without inconveniencing us.", "I get not giving her friends any but they are very little and not only may they feel left out but I thought maybe if my daughter and her friends had the same cookies it would also make my daughter not feel left out. I also like your idea of notes and will be doing that in the future.", "We can\u2019t just buy more. But I really did think I was rude to him and was stressing about it. It\u2019s not super easy to resolve things with him at this point and time. It also wasn\u2019t a fight.", "Like he doesn't already know what the issue is. He is that poor child's father. He knows.", "I told him the plan but didn\u2019t tell him when I was making them so maybe that was the issue? He tends to not bother with party planning since I love it so much so my guess is he forgot.", "Will add my mil who is a wonderful woman and amazing baker is bringing cookies with gluten for everyone else at the party! She tries not to bother with my daughter because of how picky she is about textures, for right now my daughter would greatly prefer store bought dough.", "I can understand her being upset with him eating the cookies. The cost of gluten free products is ridiculous. Being gluten free as well, I would be upset too, knowing he can go eat anything else and be ok.", "He can\u2019t not have them but this is before the party and it causes an inconvenience. They are expensive and nobody was eating them today. If he had waited until the party there would be cookies that we couldn\u2019t have and he could eat those.", "I told him but he may have forgot, they are very expensive so we can\u2019t just replace them without cutting something like queso dip or potato chips for the party. Also if my daughter has 2 and I have 1 then that only leaves 4 and my daughter is having 6 friends who could feel left out. They are young. This means there are NO EXTRA.", "Not particularly. There are other snacks around the house and nobody was going to be eating cookies today. We have a really tight budget and I needed to be very careful about what I bought and such or else I could not be able to get another important thing. I also need enough gas money and so does he, it\u2019s really hard to calculate it all especially since I\u2019ve been on call to be able to take her birthday off. We do have cookies that a friend gave us for helping her out with her small business when her fianc\u00e9 went on a business trip and those weren\u2019t gluten free. He could have had those and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think about grabbing cookies for him.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I assumed he knew but maybe there was miscommunication.", "Sounds like he's taking Pb and j for lunch then? I don't see why you and your daughter should go without because he's being rather greedy. Anyway, NTA in my opinion. I hope your daughter has a great birthday.", "Offer them the cupcakes and other cookies first.  Then, give your daughter the expensive gf ones. If any kid asks for one, you can do it, but again, even little kids understand that someone can only have one kind and that's it.", "That\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s a bummer he can\u2019t just accept that those aren\u2019t for him. Though in all fairness it\u2019s a weak argument to say that the cookies could be for other people on the bday but not him now. Either way, seems silly for him to be grumpy about cookies that aren\u2019t meant for him due to gluten.", "Yeh but chances are these cupcakes she was going to get would've been more expensive than some cookies. Gf or not. \nAs I said, he should definitely replace them because its not fair to remive the option from his wife and daughter ( even if it was an accident), but he shouldn't be banned from gluten free items just because he also has the ability to eat other things. He just needs to be considerate when he does.", "So it sounds like since he made the mistake, he needs to figure it out so everybody has enough. I get it if the finacial side is tight but I can only assume he's not such a monster that he would've continued to eat them had he known there was no option to get more or there wouldnt be enough. \n\nAnd if he is, that's a whole other can of worms.", "Consider adding this as an edit.", "Okay, got it! I really suck at this whole mom thing especially with her being gluten free. I thought I would do better with time but I really haven\u2019t improved. I love your suggestions though!", "No. You're winning the mom thing. You are having a party and celebrating your daughter and making sure she has something sweet to eat at even the TEMPERATURE she likes it. You're doing great. Just be sure to try my cookie recipe, if she can have peanut butter. It's the best. Enjoy the party.", "I\u2019m not good at baking but she loves peanut butter and these store bought ones only come in sugar and chocolate chip. I\u2019ve been wanting to try baking but I gave up I\u2019m the past because nothing ever came out right. Considering we have all the stuff in the recipe I think I might even try it out so if she likes them I can make more for the party and I can spend less in the future! Also thank you for making me feel better about parenting. It\u2019s hard but I guess I\u2019m not as bad at it as I thought.", "Second this pb cookie recipe - it\u2019s my go to. I make them with or without chocolate, or I\u2019ll add a hersheys kiss the last 2 minutes of baking, or I\u2019ll roll them in sugar. I also add vanilla (for this ratio, 2tsp)."]}
