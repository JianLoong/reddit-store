{"id": 32777, "submission_id": "18feqpf", "title": "AITA for moving out knowing my boyfriend has nowhere to go?", "selftext": "For some background, I (F20) and my boyfriend, S(M24) have been together for roughly a year and a half. Before living together he stayed with some friends of his and I was still living at home with my mom. Well my mom and I were having issues, and his lease was ending so we decided to move in together seven months ago. It\u2019s important to note that I fully furnished our apartment (he had no furniture of his own and brought his PC set-up, bed, a TV, and an air fryer) on my own. I also paid the first month of rent, security deposit and paid to turn on all the utilities and internet. Our first month together was really rough, lots of arguing but it got better. Unfortunately once it got better he got hit with a 7k bill from his previous apartment because apparently they failed to pay two months of rent, a few months of utilities, left it a mess and failed to give a proper notice. I\u2019d just secured a new job paying much more than my old one, so we agreed I would cover our household bills and he would get a second job and pay off that debt. \nWell, this did not happen. He refused to get a second job entirely and opted to keep his fast food job instead of trying to find something that would pay him more. In turn, this led to me working my full time job, getting a second job, and keeping up with my homework as I am a full time college student. It took him six months to pay off this bill. In those six months I was responsible for maintaining our household bills, both of our personal bills, and all the chores (laundry, dishes, daily cleaning, cooking etc.). For months I sat and cried, begged, yelled at him to help me or get a second job to contribute more. Each time I was met with the same excuse \u201cI\u2019ll try to do better.\u201d\nFast forward to this past week, his bill is paid off and now he\u2019s able to pay for our household bills again. I sat him down and told him that I will be moving out as these past few months were absolutely terrible and I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re compatible living partners. He sat and cried and begged me to stay, that he would try to do better. I told him flat out that he\u2019s been telling me that for months with no results, and that if I\u2019m forced to do everything alone when he is more than capable of helping, then I\u2019d much rather be alone. I haven\u2019t been able to save up any money for obvious reasons so I\u2019m giving myself two months to get the money together and move out. \nHe\u2019s still upset and cries telling me he doesn\u2019t want to lose me and that he just hasn\u2019t been able to help with anything due to stress and anxiety, but he\u2019s had plenty of energy to play on the game with his friends for hours these past few months. So, I feel like I could be the asshole since I make significantly more than he does and im basically giving him two months to figure things out.

If he could play video games, he could've gotten a second job...or at least done all of the housework, since you were the one paying all the household bills. \n\nBut, if I were you, I'd make sure that you're both moved out of the apartment at the same time...or maybe you could even leave just a wee bit later.

You gave your boyfriend seven months to get his life together and become a contributing, adult member of the household.  His failure to do so is his own fault, not yours.  \n\nFurthermore, being the only adult in the household has forced you to take on responsibilities that you should not have assumed -- and that rebounded to your detriment, taking a toll on your mental health.  **You have a right to protect your mental health.  Doing so does not make you the AH in any way, shape, or form.**\n\nSo you can leave with a clear conscience.  \n\nAs far as the rest goes -- I would like to offer two observations:\n\n1)  If you are able to keep the apartment on your own for a couple months and there is sufficient space for a roommate situation to work, then I suggest that you eject your boyfriend and find a roommate.  \n\n2)  If the above is not possible, then I suggest that you try to find other living quarters, even if it means you are couch surfing while you pay two more months of rent (or a share thereof) on this apartment.  If you remain in residence with this man, then you will have to spend the next two months listen to him constantly whine, and he may wear down your resolve.", "So you've given him 2 months notice, is that right?  That's more than fair.  He's not treating you as a partner, he's acting more like it's summer vacation when you're 14.  You've put up with his behavior long enough.\n\nNTA", "NTA, this guy is a total user.  There is no way he didn't know that he was going to owe money for terminating a lease early, failing to pay rent, and damaging someone else's property.\n\nGet away quick!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
