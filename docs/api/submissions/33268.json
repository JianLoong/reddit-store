Sleep deprivation is part of my life. I work in healthcare, so I have learned to adapt to unusual sleep circumstances. My fianc\u00e9 has a regular work schedule and is the type of person whose body naturally wakes him up 30 seconds before the alarm goes off. \r  \n\r  \nI am upset with him because if I sleep through my alarm, he does not wake me up. He says that it is \"not his responsibility\" to wake me up or to manage my sleep schedule. While I don\u2019t expect him to wake me up daily, I do expect him to act as my safety net in the event that I need it. This has become a deeper issue for me, because I think he is being an unsupportive partner. \r  \n\r  \nExample 1: \r  \nI work at the hospital full time and I\u2019m also working on my master\u2019s degree. Recently, between my 12 hours shift and my night class, I told my fianc\u00e9 that I was going to lay down for 1 hour. I was exhausted, but couldn't afford to miss class. I explained that I worked again the next day, and needed to be able to sleep that night. 3.5 hours later, I jolted out of bed wondering what day/month/year it was. When confronting my fianc\u00e9 as to why he didn\u2019t wake me up, he just shrugged his shoulders and said I must have needed the extra sleep. I missed half my class and was not rested for my next 12 hour shift. \r  \n\r  \nExample 2:\r  \nWe were spending the night at his family\u2019s home during the holidays. I am not totally comfortable around his family yet, and really wanted his support. Since we were sleeping together in the guest room, I assumed we would get up together and go downstairs for family breakfast, together. To my absolute horror, I woke up in an empty bed at 11am. His extended family had already arrived and were all socializing downstairs. I completely missed family breakfast. The rest of the day consisted of passive aggressive \u201cjokes\u201d about how much the family had accomplished in the 5 hours before I even brushed my teeth. They clearly thought I was rude, and even dubbed me as the \"Diva\" of the family. I expressed to my fianc\u00e9 that I felt totally humiliated and was disappointed in making a poor impression on his entire family. Seriously, why didn\u2019t you f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* wake me up???!!!\r  \n\r  \nLook, I get it. I am a grown up. I care for critical patients every day in the hospital, and I know how to look after myself. The thing is, if I had spinach in my teeth, I would expect my fianc\u00e9 to tell me about it. If I slept through my alarm and had a very important obligation, I would expect my fianc\u00e9 to tell me about it! Especially considering the circumstances\u2026 I\u2019m slugging 60 hour weeks to make both of our dreams come true. When he says, in other words, that my problems are not his responsibility\u2026 I feel unsupported \u2013 like he\u2019s shaking his finger at me so I learn my lesson, or something. \r  \n\r  \nAITA for expecting my fianc\u00e9 to wake me up?????\r\n\nEdit: Just wanted to clarify\u2026 \n1. I do use an alarm. \n2. These are one-off events when I don\u2019t wake up on time. \n3. My partner and I disagree on whether the wake-up courteously is a supportive act of partnership or a responsibility I am forcing him to assume.

You didn't ask him specifically to wake you up if the alarm won't do the job. One thing is because he wasn't asked, he might've not kept his eye on time, and second I might've thought you decided to skip this class and regenerate more before work (but that's just based on me knowing my husband's behavior). \n\n\n2. This one is weird, because a natural thing to do when it's your house, your family, your family's wedding/birthday, or whatever, is you making sure your SO feels welcome and comfortable. And I would understand his point of view if he, for example, brought some food from breakfast to your room (so he didn't want to wake you but made sure you eat something), and then explained your schedule and how exhausting it can be to his family, and especially did not let them make the 'jokes'. \n\n\nI think he either doesn't get it, and perhaps a bigger talk is in order, or he does get it and choses to act like that. If the latter, then there isn't much you can do because he doesn't care for you very much.", "NTA\n\nI'm seeing a lot of people with the \"I'm correct, which means I'm right\" attitude. Like yea, it's everyone's responsibility to wake up, but why the hell would you not want to help someone you care about? Like, this isn't a case of her telling her fiance to interrupt his sleep to wake her up. It's literally him being fully awake, noticing she's still sleeping, and not even trying to help. The first one is especially bad, because he was already told that it was important. \n\nLike, as someone who also has experience waking up early for healthcare-related reasons (I just graduated nursing school), my wives have always been super supportive in helping me get up (especially helpful since I have a shitty sleep schedule and love sleeping). \n\nI just don't get the logic of seeing your partner, someone you love, potentially struggling with something, and just going \"eh, that's their problem\".", "I\u2019m going to go with yta, solely due to the fact that in none of your examples do you ever ask/say anything about him waking you up if you sleep through your alarm.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t his responsibility to wake you up, but if you sleep through the alarm then it\u2019s what a good person would do. If you\u2019re working all these hours, and can only get certain amounts of time to sleep, your boyfriend should be there for you as much as possible.", "INFO: How often do you need him to wake you up? If occasionally I see your point (my husband would work irregular shifts and had a messed up sleep schedule and I would definitely wake him up because I didn\u2019t want him to lose his job) but if regularly I see his (for husband got him the alarm that also vibrates the bed which works 95 percent of the time)", "ESH to be honest \u2014 what if he wasn\u2019t there?? While it\u2019s obvious you have a stressful job and works crazy hours, you are an adult and you should be able to manage your sleep schedule alone. \nThat being said - if he KNOWS you need to get up hw should out of just being a good person maybe make the assumption that he should help you.\nThe part with his family though he is 100% TA\nBUT I think you should have communicated better and tell him what you were expecting", "OP, where I'm from, an engagement is a testing ground for your future partner. Are they a good person? Do your ethics and moral compass match? Do your life expectations match? Do they treat you right? An engagement is the place to find this out, before committing. Listen to your gut feelings. If he's uncaring now, how caring will he be after marriage? If you fall sick will he care for you or divorce you the moment he doesn't benefit financially/materially from your existence? \"I'm working hard to make both our dreams come true\" is a red flag to me, frankly, because I've seen many stories like this where the guy is just using their partner for the financial support and once he's on his feet he divorces and gets with someone too young. It's especially a red flag that he doesn't do something as minor as waking you up.\n\nOff topic, but if alarms don't work for you, try something that causes a vibration or movement.", "YTA.\n\nNo, you need to learn how to wake up for your alarm. \n\nOtherwise, you're expecting your significant other to take care of you as you would take care of a child, making sure they get up for school, etc.\n\n I've dated many people that couldn't do the normal adult things, wake up with a single alarm, can't wake up with multiple alarms, forget to set their alarms and I got my own thing going on. What would you do if you didn't have your significant other? Be late for work?", "INFO: Did you *tell him* to wake you up in those instances? Because there's a difference between 'I am going to sleep for 1 hour' and 'Please wake me up if in 1 hour I am not awake'. \n\nI am one of those people who won't touch you to wake you up if you haven't explicitly told me so, because I hate being woken up and manage my own sleeping schedule like everybody else should.", "I\u2019ll say NTA. I seriously don\u2019t understand why your fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t wake you up. I understand working in healthcare is tough and you don\u2019t hear alarms because you\u2019re so used to hearing them all day. Your fianc\u00e9 should be understanding and caring since it seems you\u2019re working more and harder than he is. So realistically I\u2019ll say you\u2019re the main income maker of the two of you. I also am appalled that his family were passive aggressive with you and I\u2019m assuming they know you work in healthcare. He should\u2019ve stood up for you and defended you. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t seem to be very caring. I\u2019m not sure if I could deal with a lifetime of that man or his family.", "NTA. However he\u2019s a massive AH for the family visit move in particular. He clearly doesn\u2019t get what healthcare workers go through to do what they do. Does his job keep people alive? If not, it\u2019s less important than yours. Period. He sounds insensitive, judgmental, and self-righteous. If I were in your shoes I would not want to rely on a dude like that to support me in the \u201cfor worse\u201d because he\u2019ll always make his lack of support somehow your fault.", "NTA your fiance is a bit of a d*ck on this (his family sounds like they suck for the passive aggressive comments). You are an adult but your schedule can mean you\u2019re a super heavy sleeper adjusting to an ever changing schedule. If his family still makes comments, just say, \u201cyeah, sleeping and being a nurse is hard. You\u2019re awake on adrenaline making sure people don\u2019t die\u201d.\n\nIf your fiance doesn\u2019t understand that, how do you see the future with him? What if you have kids? There\u2019s a selfishness there that is pretty concerning.", "Out of curiosity, have you come out and asked him to wake you up, or are you assuming he'll take the hint that you want him to by telling him you have something important going on?\n\nHonestly, I'm split on this. I've been asked many, many times over the years, to wake someone up. It definitely gets old after a while.\n\nBut I do understand if it's an occasional thing for important events, then yea, it really shouldn't be that much of a problem for him to help you.", "INFO: has it been more than a couple of occasions?  You listed two. Does it happen regularly?", "YTA. How many times have we seen men on this sub upset that their SO wouldn\u2019t wake them up and the consensus is they are adults they can wake themselves up? But now the genders are switched and people are suddenly saying he needs to help. Kinda ironic. Also in both your incidents you make zero mention of you asking and him agreeing to wake you up. Seems more like you expected him to and are now upset he didn\u2019t do something he never agreed to do", "In none of your examples did you ever ASK to be woken this is a communication breakdown", "INFO\n\nHow would you manage if he was not in the picture? Would being single mean, you could not do your job properly, as you cannot manage your sleep schedule by yourself?", "If you didn't have a partner and lived alone how would you handle this problem?", "YTA \n\nI didn\u2019t see anywhere in your post where you specifically asked him to wake you up and he accepted. You are assuming he will take on the responsibility of waking up another adult without communicating.\n\nMy ex struggled to wake up with alarms and I often had to spend upwards of half an hour trying to wake him up for his work/family events/social gatherings\u2026. It\u2019s exhausting and unfair, just one more massive responsibility and mental load because he (you!) couldn\u2019t figure out how to manage his own sleep.", "There seems to be a deeper problem here (you not feeling supported by fianc\u00e9) that an internet verdict isn't going to fix.  Fianc\u00e9 might also have values that are driving this behavior, too.  \n\nBut NTA... If I were in his shoes, I'd consider this helping future wife through a difficult time.", "well your feelings are your feelings, we can't tell you how to feel but...\n\nyou know how hard is for you to wake up, you  hold yourself at an impossible standard. 8 hours of sleep is a must, it's not for \"fun\" or who's doing it it's weak. It's necessary so our brains rest and the same for our bodies...\n\nanyway.. you put yourself in this position ,you have to be responsible for yourself.. so, set multiple alarms 5 minutes apart maximum, the phone put somewhere where you actually have to get out of the bed to reach to close and  either put an alarm that absolutely annoys you or something that you know it definitely works to wake you up.", "I am someone who hates being woken up, by the alarm or by a person doesn\u2019t matter but I prefer the alarm since it won\u2019t hurt being mad at it. Therefore, I would be really really uncomfortable to wake someone else up, cause I hate being woken up myself so I don\u2019t want to do it to someone else. Instead, I would just assume that they have it under control and let them sleep. But if you actually ask him to wake you up, I guess it\u2019s a different thing.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO grow up and take responsibility for your life.", "I thought a relationship was a partnership. I may be wrong as it\u2019s been awhile.  How is the \u201cit\u2019s not my problem\u201d attitude come up?  You help each other out when needed. His callous attitude is the AH here much less his difference to how you are perceived by his family.", "NTA\n\nFianc\u00e9 needs a demotion....\n\nSchool and full time healthcare is an intensive rotation.  Been there, done that.  I used to also put my phone onto a boombox stereo and crank the volume so if I got called (when I was on-call) or my alarmed sounded I would hear it.  When you're extremely sleep deprived you alarm or a song (I can't use songs) can easily become part of your dream state.  The stereo was placed across my room (had to stand up and move to deal with it). It was loud.  When you're up for a day or two that crash is hard. \n\nThere are loud apps you can use.  \n\nThere are also super loud alarm clocks. \n\nPretty crappy feeling working yourself to the bone, upgrading/getting a degree and having your partner just sit back and watch you drown on the exceptionally hard days.  THAT'S A PRETTY MAJOR SIGN!!!  You're so exhausted that I'm sure dealing with it makes you prefer to pull out your own fingernails but you deserve better than that.  It's not a big ask, at all. \n\nY'all don't sound equally matched.  \n\nI can't imagine watching my partner bust their rear to build us a life and just kicking back being \"sounds a lot like a you problem kid\". Yuck!  \n\nGet the loudest alarms you can find.  Put several of them around your room.  Do what you got to do.  This won't last forever.  Sleep whenever you possibly can.  No more wasting sleep catch up days at that loser's families place.  Focus on you and your balance and needs.  Get yourself through that finish line girl!!!  You got this.", "Depends. If it's constant or if he'd try to wake you up in the past and you still didn't get up/ got rude about it, then I wouldn't wake you up either. If it's rarely, then I don't see why he wouldn't. \n\nMy husband will snooze a million alarms then go \"it never went off\" meanwhile I'm being woken up by them and shake him awake (to no avail) just so the alarms stop. So yeah, that's not my responsibility at that point.", "NTA. You have a crazy work schedule and are clearly a deep sleeper. No it\u2019s not technically \u2018his responsibility\u2019 to wake you but you are in a relationship and are supposed to be a partnership. Where is the goodwill? Also his family seems really mean making passive aggressive jokes at your expense when you are clearly not a deadbeat. I would seriously reconsider a marriage with someone so mean spirited", "I think you should invest in a Fitbit or something that will physically buzz against your skin. Also, yes, if it really is occasional events and especially if you ask him clearly in advance, it\u2019s something that a good partner should be willing to do for you.", "My son slept through every alarm in high school. I bought him a vibrating alarm - a slim disk that is slipped under the pillow and clipped to the pillowcase.   He's 25 now and I think he still owns it, maybe even uses it.\n\nWorked like a charm AND it was quiet for the rest of us! ;-)", "I have a fitness tracker alarm which vibrates on my wrist at 555am.

Period. \n\nYou are experiencing a lot of sleep deprivation and it\u2019s really not much to ask your partner to be there during such a challenging time in life.

NAH. Perhaps you really needed the nap and missing class is not the end of the world. \n\n2. NTA. Even if you needed the rest, you could've been awake to greet them at least. \n\nFinal point... have you considered using an alarm??", "YTA- He has been very clear with you that this responsibility and support is something he doesn\u2019t consent to. He doesn\u2019t want to be your safety net in this way. He gets to make that determination just like you get to decide if that is a dealbreaker for you. \n\nPersonally- I\u2019ve been on both sides of this equation- and my response is hell fucking no. I don\u2019t wake partners up unless I happen to notice mine is super late- and I don\u2019t make them my safety net for getting my ass out of bed. And if I ever had to go back to that hellish schedule again, I would insist on two bedrooms- one for me with the 500 alarm clocks I need to wake my ass up or sleep at odd times.", "NTA - the family thing bugs me. You work crazy hours in a hospital and are working on your masters degree!?!? You do more in 24 hours on a normal day then the do in a week!", "I was to say that is your fault at the very beginning of your story, but then you explained that your work (full time job) and you prepare a degree, which means to me that you have 2 full time jobs ! And it's not a forever situation, it's just for a short period (in life) that you'll need sleep, so your body won't let you hear the alarm because your brain is under too much stress and is too tired to just let you wake up. \n\nYou should explain that this way to your partner. When you'll have your degree, when your body and your brain will recover, you'll be able to wake up by yourself. But now, you're clearly in pain. For sure, your body feels good but if your brain is no more able to let you get up, it's an intern alarm to say \"Nope ! I don't want to. I need more rest !\". You should listen to it : I know a degree is hard to prepare but try keep a minimum of time for sleeping and rest in your planning. Even if there's some laundry to do, but it's time for sleep : go to sleep ! \n\nGood luck for your degree !", "NTA. Tho your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family sounds like AH.

Sleep deprivation is part of my life. I work in healthcare, so I have learned to adapt to unusual sleep circumstances. My fianc\u00e9 has a regular work schedule and is the type of person whose body naturally wakes him up 30 seconds before the alarm goes off. \r  \n\r  \nI am upset with him because if I sleep through my alarm, he does not wake me up. He says that it is \"not his responsibility\" to wake me up or to manage my sleep schedule. While I don\u2019t expect him to wake me up daily, I do expect him to act as my safety net in the event that I need it. This has become a deeper issue for me, because I think he is being an unsupportive partner. \r  \n\r  \nExample 1: \r  \nI work at the hospital full time and I\u2019m also working on my master\u2019s degree. Recently, between my 12 hours shift and my night class, I told my fianc\u00e9 that I was going to lay down for 1 hour. I was exhausted, but couldn't afford to miss class. I explained that I worked again the next day, and needed to be able to sleep that night. 3.5 hours later, I jolted out of bed wondering what day/month/year it was. When confronting my fianc\u00e9 as to why he didn\u2019t wake me up, he just shrugged his shoulders and said I must have needed the extra sleep. I missed half my class and was not rested for my next 12 hour shift. \r  \n\r  \nExample 2:\r  \nWe were spending the night at his family\u2019s home during the holidays. I am not totally comfortable around his family yet, and really wanted his support. Since we were sleeping together in the guest room, I assumed we would get up together and go downstairs for family breakfast, together. To my absolute horror, I woke up in an empty bed at 11am. His extended family had already arrived and were all socializing downstairs. I completely missed family breakfast. The rest of the day consisted of passive aggressive \u201cjokes\u201d about how much the family had accomplished in the 5 hours before I even brushed my teeth. They clearly thought I was rude, and even dubbed me as the \"Diva\" of the family. I expressed to my fianc\u00e9 that I felt totally humiliated and was disappointed in making a poor impression on his entire family. Seriously, why didn\u2019t you f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* wake me up???!!!\r  \n\r  \nLook, I get it. I am a grown up. I care for critical patients every day in the hospital, and I know how to look after myself. The thing is, if I had spinach in my teeth, I would expect my fianc\u00e9 to tell me about it. If I slept through my alarm and had a very important obligation, I would expect my fianc\u00e9 to tell me about it! Especially considering the circumstances\u2026 I\u2019m slugging 60 hour weeks to make both of our dreams come true. When he says, in other words, that my problems are not his responsibility\u2026 I feel unsupported \u2013 like he\u2019s shaking his finger at me so I learn my lesson, or something. \r  \n\r  \nAITA for expecting my fianc\u00e9 to wake me up?????\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "My boyfriend works night shifts and is a huge soccer nerd, so during his breaks at work, when he calls me, he'll look up what games are on the next day and at what times. If any of his teams are playing, he'll tell me about it, and if they're before the time he typically wakes up, he says, \"Well, I'm waking up early tomorrow.\" He sucks at waking up though he needs a loud ass alarm that goes off at least twice or has to be shaken 3 times. And every I'm there with him, I'll wake him up cause I know it's something he cares about and would be bummed about missing. Even if it means he only sleeps 4 hours, which I hate cause I want him to sleep 8 hours, I'll still try to wake him up and see if he still wants to watch it, if he say no then we go back to sleep. If he gets up and runs immediately to the TV, then I'll follow him, and we'll sit on the couch and end up falling asleep there. Point is though I'd do it just to make him happy and he can't even do it when it'll fuck up your whole day? That definitely says something.", "Question before I can answer - in your example of telling your fianc\u00e9 you were going to sleep for an hour, did you follow it up with please make sure I\u2019m up in an hour? Because if not then YTA. If so then NTA. If the former you cannot expect your fiance to know that when you say you\u2019re lying down for an hour what you really mean is to have him wake you up. Same with the family thing. Did you ask him to wake you up so you could go downstairs for breakfast or did you just assume he would? Again how you answer that is what would make YTA or NTA", "Yes. \n\nI also think there is a significant difference in, \"I can't be bothered to wake up on time regularly on my own because I am codependent and incapable of taking responsibility for myself\" and, \"I work 60 hr work weeks on top of a Master's program and *occasionally* ask my partner to wake me up/make sure I am awake since my chronic exhaustion lends to me sometimes oversleeping.\" \n\nThis also isn't OP being such a heavy sleeper that their bf has to spend 15 minutes shaking/shouting/harassing them into wakefulness (my ex was like that). This is just, \"Please make sure I wake up from my nap because I'm so exhausted I could probably sleep through the apocalypse, but I also still have very important things I need to get done today.\" \n\nIf it is truly occasional like OP says, then there shouldn't be an issue with it and it's a bit odd that their partner is so firmly taking the stance of it being an unfair major responsibility/burden.\n\nETA: Okay, someone pointed out that in neither example did OP directly *ask* their bf to actually wake them up. His stance makes a lot more sense to me now. I feel like this entire problem could be solved by OP just... doing that instead of passively emphasizing how important it is they wake up at a certain time, and then getting upset when their bf doesn't correctly interpret that as them expecting him to check in on them/make sure they are awake.", "\"wives\"? sorry. just need to know the backstory on this", "Thank you!

It's literally the base level of being considerate.  \n\nI know from experience, it's easy to sleep in or sleep through your alarm when you're exhausted, sleep deprived and stressed out.
