My brother and Cain's mom deal with some issues. I do have a 17yo son (Lex) and WFH so I have a lot of spare time. \n\nI love having Cain because I get to be a little kid dad again. Lex doesn't seem to mind that Cain basically lives here. Yesterday I took him shopping at Target and he asked me if he could this quad drone. I said I had a better idea. You can have Lex's old drone which bigger! We just need batteries because Lex hasn't used it in like 8 years. \n\nThen it hit me why not give Cain all of Lex's old toys. Legos, action figures, games, etc all collecting dust in the closet. Cain was so happy about it.\n\nWhile I was giving Cain a bath, Cain was playing with some of Lex's toy cars, Lex came into the bathroom and told Cain to pit back his toys  when he's done. Lex was annoyed that Cain was using his toys.\n\nI told Cainto ignore Lex and I'll talk to him. After I put Cain to bed, I told Lex that I gave Cain his toys. Lex said to stop and put his stuff back. I said that he's 17yo and has not touched his old toys in like 8 years. So what if I give them to Cain.\n\nLex said it was still his. I said yes, but you're 17. You don't play with toys anymore. It's fine to let other kids use them. It's not like I took stuff out of his room. I'm not buying something twice if I already have it home.

The idea wasn\u2019t bad but you really mishandled it. You could have talked with Lex and together chosen some items to give to Cain. It could have been a nice moment. \n\nInstead you unilaterally \u201cgave\u201d Cain all Lex\u2019s toys and shamed him for having any sense of sentimentality about them. That was crappy.\n\nI have a toy horse that I don\u2019t \u201cplay with\u201d cause I\u2019m 47, but I like having it, the memories are connected with our first house we lived in till I was 5. In contrast I told my mom to give away my old doll house to whoever could use it. \n\nI bet there were some items he would willingly give up if asked, but you spoiled that by being a dictator.", "YTA.\n\nYou gave those toys to your son. It\u2019s his.\n\nI still keep some of my old toys from 35 years ago as a sentimental reminder of my late parents.", "YTA -- I suspect that Lex feels he is being replaced.", "YTA - You're happy to have another opportunity to be Dad to a child at the expense of stealing your actual son's toys. They're not yours, so don't touch them, or you could always offer to buy them off of your son and see if his opinion changes then?", "YTA. Having childhood toys when you're grown up can be something of great sentimental value. And maybe things we might want to give to our own children when we have them.     \nYou stole these toys. Apologise and give them back, and buy new toys for cousin.", "YTA. They weren't yours to give away.", "YTA\n\nYour oldest and youngest are your kids. You didn\u2019t ask your 17 if you could pass on the toys that he may have sentimental value to the 7 year old. If you constantly treat this is normal then your really showing that you don\u2019t care for your eldest and only want to spoil the youngest.", "YTA\nThose were not yours to just give away. You should have asked your son and accepted either his 'yes' or 'no'.", "YTA. for giving away your son's memories.", "The toys aren't yours, they're you son's. You had no right to let Cain play with. Would you be okay with someone borrowing your, say, your tools without permission? Probably not. YTA.", "YTA - my parents gave away my brother and I's comic collection from when we were kids and used this same stupid mentality. Turns out our comics were worth between $15k-$20k. They were dispersed to little kids (under 10) throughout their neighbourhood. Wasn't to pleased when visiting home and see all our childhood toys were given away. My brother now has his own child who he would love to have shared his childhood toys with. But they were all given away....", "YTA\n\nThose toys were given to your son - yes? Then they became HIS property - not yours. I'm sure you have things you haven't used in 10 years than you still value and don't want to get rid of.\n\nWhat you are doing is saying your son's feelings don't matter - his ownership of his own toys doesn't matter. You are throwing away your relationship with your son at the cost of some toys because you are having fun playing young dad. In other words - all of this is all about YOU.\n\nOnce your son leaves and doesn't want anything do with you, you'll be all - what did I do?", "YTA.  And in a few years you\u2019ll be asking why your adult son never talks to you.", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019re going to give away someone else\u2019s stuff, you should at least do them the courtesy of asking first. If you\u2019re going to allow someone to use someone else\u2019s stuff, again, ask first. That\u2019s entry level respect stuff, and it\u2019s honestly sad that as a parent of a seventeen year old, you haven\u2019t learned that before now. \n\nPlus, maybe your son finds sentimental value in his old stuff and doesn\u2019t want it given away or broken - and there shouldn\u2019t be a single thing wrong with that, either. Men not being \u201callowed\u201d to be sentimental amounts to toxic masculinity, and hopefully you don\u2019t want to impart that ideal upon him.", "YTA. it\u2019s his toys, not yours to just give then to other kid. Its clearly that you prefer your nephew than your son. I\u2019m 18 and i still have my collections of Barbie, Monster High and Polly Pocket even through i stopped playing with then 6 years ago and my parents never ever once tried to give then to someone because they know that its my toys and i decide what i want to do with it.", "I'm going to have to go with YTA. we develop sentimental attachment to things and you didn't take Lex's feelings into consideration. \n\nNot only that, but you taught Cain that Lex's feelings don't matter and he doesn't have to respect Lex.", "YTA - You can\u2019t take someone else\u2019s property and give it away without permission. That is pretty basic common sense.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that they weren\u2019t in use. They are *his.* Did it occur to you that he may just want to hold onto them for sentimental value? Or save them in case he has his own kids someday?\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate when something that is his is no longer \u201chis.\u201d You\u2019re only entitled to share or give away your own things.", "YTA. This feels like you are taking advantage of the power dynamic with your 17 year old son. It\u2019s as if those toys belong to you in your mind because you paid for them and therefore you can give them away. They don\u2019t. They\u2019re not yours to give away. They belong to your son. Only he has the authority or the right to give them away. It\u2019s not your call. You violated his boundaries, you disrespected him, and you shoved the power dynamic between you down his throat. Well, I don\u2019t think that you intended to be mean, you definitely were coldhearted in the situation and lacked any consideration for your 17-year-old son\u2018s feelings. You were inconsiderate at best and downright mean as far as I can see. On top of that, you placed your son in a bad spot because you committed his toys to some child when he doesn\u2019t want to give them away. Definitely not cool. YTA.", "YTA - doesn't matter what age, they are still his. . . You didn't even ask him first if you could hand down some of his toys you just out right gave them to Cain. \nIt's not fair to Cain as he's been promised something that is not yours to give and it's not fair to Lex as you gave what's not yours away.\nI'm an adult and I still have some of the toys I had as a kid, some for sentimental value and some that I'd love to hand down to my kids if/when I have any. So yeah I feel even if you don't see value on a 17 year old keeping them, Lex has his own set of values with those toys and that's important.", "YTA. If you had *asked* him if his cousin could play with his old toys, he probably wouldn't have minded it. But the fact that you just assumed it was ok to give them away shows that you have no respect for your son's boundaries.", "YTA. Doesn't matter if he hasn't played with them in 8 years, they're still his. And just giving his stuff away without telling him is a big AH move.", "Not for that so much, while it's reasonable to ask him if he can give his toys away if he doesn't want them anymore, that's up to him how he answers, you're a major asshole for giving someone else his stuff without even considering asking.\n\nYou're being a bad (and incredibly immature) dad, and setting an awful example for your nephew. Not a good way to teach someone to be a good cousin. So, YTA.", "YTA. And Cain is not your son.", "I\u2019m going with YTA\n\nYou\u2019re essentially stealing from Lex. Those are his things. If he doesn\u2019t play with them, that\u2019s his choice. You can ask Lex if Cain can play with the toys, and it\u2019ll be up to Lex to allow it or not. \n\nAnother reason is the guilt trip at the end. \u201cBe a good cousin\u201d is essentially telling Lex that he isn\u2019t good at all, and that you\u2019re making him feel guilty. I bet that angered Lex.", "YTA I passed many onto my own son and there are ones I cherish deeply. Should have asked first to give.", "So you basically gave part of his childhood away without his permission and had the cheek to ignore his feelings on the matter and try and belittle him for not wanting to give his shit away cos he\u2019s 17 ? \n\nNice \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWatch Toy Story. Apologize to your son and stop trying to replace him with your nephew!", "Kinda YTA. Even the toys are in your house or you\u2019re the one who bought the majority of it, it does not mean you\u2019re the owner. Those are your son\u2019s toys. He is fine with the little cousin using it but to give them away without his approval is not okay.", "Yta be a good mum and ASK your son", "YTA, they're his belongings and those belongings also have memories attached to them. You have no right in deciding to give away his things.", "YTA - these were your son\u2019s possession and you should have asked before giving them away.  Period.", "YTA - You can\u2019t just give away someone else\u2019s belongings. They aren\u2019t yours to give", "YTA. My father in law, in a fit of honest generosity and enthusiasm, gave away one of my husband's toys. It never occurred to my FIL that there would be a problem. My husband understands what happened was a miscommunication, and it was a one off, so they still have a good relationship... but he's never forgotten the incident either. That was ONE toy. \n\nYou sound like you've put Lex on a shelf and you'd rather be done with him. Yikes.", "YTA. Its ok. I think you are right. But if someone has to be the AH in this situation its you. Its certainly not your 17 year old. I think you couldve handled this better by bringing Lex into the situation and making it his idea. If its his idea, Ill bet he goes along with it proudly. I dont think the action is terribly egregious, but your execution was sloppy at best.", "YTA- the only way you wouldn\u2019t be is if your son is Andy and his toys get sad when nobody plays with them.", "Whelp- here goes. YTA\n\nWhy? Imagine you have a vintage car that you craved when you were 16. Bought it at 30, fixed it up and now you sometime go out to sip a coffee and just look at your pride and joy. Do you need the car? Nope-you have something else you drive to a store. Do you love the car? Yes, because it reminds you of how you felt at that age. \n\nToys are like that. They are a reminder of a time when you felt joy and freedom.  It\u2019s up to the person that owns the toys to let them go, or pass them on to their own child. It\u2019s HIS memories and a connection to a simplistic time. \n\nYNTA also, you wanted to do the right thing, hey they\u2019re just collecting dust right? It\u2019s just simply stepping to his shoes. What if someone gave away your things without permission.", "YTA - Would you be okay with Lex taking one of your belongings they don\u2019t see you use, and giving it away without your permission? You don\u2019t take another persons property without their permission, and you especially don\u2019t give away property that doesn\u2019t belong to you!", "OP, YTA. Maybe be a better parent and respect your child's belongings and the emotional attachment he may have to them? Also, your son wasn't saying that cousin couldn't play with them, just to put them back when finished, so i fail to see the issue with what he did? Nephew can borrow toys and learn a valuable life lesson about respecting other people's things and cleaning up after oneself.\n\nMy mother took care of my younger cousin while i was in HS. She would never have acted like you do-in fact, i remember multiple times her asking if i would be okay if cousins played with my toys. I had a special place to put the ones that i didn't want to chance getting broken or damaged that the younger kids weren't allowed to play with. And now, in my 30's, i still have those same toys in my memory box and displayed around my home. \n\nI think you're a little too focused on the fun you're having with a little kid and less so on being a parent to the child you already have. I get it, little kiddos are fun! But you're breaking some massive trust and boundaries with your son and if you don't work to fix it you chance damaging your relationship with him forever.", "YTA, entirely. That wasn't okay, you should've at least talked to him. That wasn't your choice to make.", "A soft YTA - just imagine if someone took some of your things you hadn\u2019t used in years. You\u2019d be upset. You should have asked Lex what toys he could sacrifice instead of just making the decision for them.", "YTA. I had this done to me and I was exceptionally annoyed and still recall to this day. Those are his belongings, so respect his right to do with them as he sees fit.", "YTA. Those are your son's toys and he gets to decide what he wants to do with it. You say your son doesn't mind having your nephew. Well, you're making sure it doesn't stay that way!", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s up to Cain what he wants to do with his toys.\n\nYour saying he doesn\u2019t use them so you can give them away, nope. You should have asked if there was a couple he\u2019d be willing to give or lend his cousin.\n\nBased on your argument, I\u2019m assuming anything in your home you haven\u2019t used in awhile, your son can give away. You haven\u2019t worn a piece of jewelry in a while, it\u2019s up for grabs, haven\u2019t used a purse, time to give away, etc..", "YTA, holy smokes, I hope you decide to learn from this. It\u2019s not your stuff to give away.I\u2019m still holding onto my daughters comics from 15 years ago, she loves them and doesn\u2019t want to give them away. \n\nRespect your child.", "YTA You obviously favor your nephew over your son. Your son is 17. 1 year away from being an adult. Don't damage your relationship this close to the maturity date. \n\nAll you had to do was ask your son would it be OK for nephew to use said toys. But you didn't you decided that your sons feelings are irrelevant as long as your nephew is happy. Don't be surprised if your son's attitude or relationship with his cousin starts to deteriorate.", "Go buy him some toys if you want him to have toys so bad..", "A soft YTA. I understand why you wanted to give Cain the toys but you should of talked to Lex before doing it.", "YTA because you got this in all the wrong order. You should have gone through the suggestion with Lex first. Even though logically it makes sense he probably has sentimental connections to a lot of those toys and maybe even some strange feelings about you mothering his cousin which would then be compounded by giving his stuff to Cain", "YTA. OP is letting baby craze get in the way of his good judgement and relationship with son. I bet some of Lex's reaction comes from feeling replaced.  Sharing is one thing, but straight up giving away his stuff without even asking is a total AH move.", "YTA, this is theft", "Literally how do you not see that you\u2019re TA here", "YTA god you\u2019re an asshole. Imagine your son had a classic car. One he worked on as a hobby and got running. It\u2019s sitting in the garage bc appropriate times to drive it are few and far between. You\u2019re giving it away bc he hasn\u2019t taken it out in a long time. That\u2019s the kind of asshole you are.", "YTA simply for giving away stuff that isn't yours to give away. You said they're your son's toys not yours, gave them to your nephew without talking to your son first and still have the audacity to ask if you're the AH? Just because it's your kids doesn't mean everything they own is yours to do with as you please. Have some damn respect for your own son and his belongings.", "YTA.  When you gave your son the toys they became his property. It's what happens when you give someone a gift. \n\n>I'm not buying something twice if I already have it home.\n\nExcept **you** don't have it home.  **Your son** has it at home. Some of those toys could be collectors items now.  Maybe your son knows that?  Maybe if you had asked, he'd even be willing to give **some** of them to his cousin. \n\n>I love having Cain because I get to be a little kid dad again.\n\nLet's be clear, while you're a father figure you're not dad unless your brother has given up his parental rights and you've officially adopted that child.  You are the child's Uncle. \n\n>I told Cainto ignore Lex and I'll talk to him.\n\nWay to show that child he doesn't have to listen to your son or respect his boundaries. \n\nYTA for lots of reasons.", "YTA. You didn't even ask him beforehand. It's HIS toys. For all you know he liked to vollect them or it was sentimental. Would you like him to give away stuff that's yours because you haven't used it in a while, without asking you. You even told your nephew to ignore him? You also don't have to buy \"two of the same\". You are not responsible for buying the only toys for your nephew, he has parents, and I imagine there are a lot more modern toys he would enjoy if you insisylt on paying for it. Also your post very much reads like you are replacing your son by a younger version because you miss those years. He might not be saying anything, but if I were you I would be paying close attention and would have one on one time with him and make sure he knows he is valued and loved even though he is older now. Teenagers still need their parents a lot in a different way, and thhey might even pushback, but it is what it is. I am saying this because it feels like you are completely unaware of what you are doing and I am assuming you still care deeply about your son and would hate to see tpur relarionship with him suffer because you sre being clueless.", "YTA. You\u2019re doing a do over while stealing from your son. Buy new toys if you really want to give toys to Cain.", "YTA\n\nBe a good parent. Don't dispose of your kid's stuff like it's your own property. Unless you have it chirping in the back of your brain that he's not entitled to decide since he's your kid and you think everything he has actually belongs to you... do you?", "Yta", "YTA, you are showing your BIOLOGICAL son that He no longer counts as your child to you since He is not a little child anymore.", "YTA. Accept it and give Lex his stuff back.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your stuff to give away.", "Gentle YTA.  I think you could have easily gotten your son's buy-in on this if you just took the time to communicate with him before unilaterally giving ALL his toys to his young cousin. Even at 17, those toys hold cherished memories. You missed an opportunity to allow your son to participate and help decide which toys to pass on.", "YTA - despite their seemingly lack of interest, even 17 year olds treasure their old toys and the memories that come with them. You should have asked first. You should also attempt to spend time with Lex so he doesn\u2019t perceive you\u2019re replacing him with your nephew. Even if Lex turns you down, he needs to know he is still your number one.", "Sorry, but YTA. My mother did a similar thing with my gameboy color, she basically gave it to my niece without my consent, it turns out that by that time I had donated most of my toys, but I kept three toys for myself as they are very meaningful to me (one of them was my gameboy color). Although she didn't do it out of malice, I was very angry about that situation, even though I was about 27 years old at the time, but still, she should have asked first and you should have done the same with your son, ask if he wouldn't mind you giving his toys to his cousin.", "YTA Did you miss the part where the toys belong to Lex? When you took them to give to Cain, you STOLE them. You knew what you were doing was wrong bc you didn\u2019t run it by Lex first.", "YTA for not even asking your son. If you had asked him up front before taking his belongings he could\u2019ve told you which ones he wanted to keep for sentimental reasons. They weren\u2019t yours to take or give away, but you did both those things.", "YTA. No contest. Congrats here is your trophy. You didn't even ASK your son if there were any that he has sentimental attachment to before you offered them. How would you feel if your parent walked into your house and started giving your stuff they had gifted to you to your cousin because they wanted it?", "Yep, YTA.", "YTA. My mother gave away all of my Barbies to a down on her luck friend to sell on eBay and 20 years later I\u2019m still heartbroken by it. I had sentimental ones and some that were special gifts I would\u2019ve loved to keep. My children have loads of hot wheels, trains, etc from their father and uncle and I wish badly I had my Barbies to add to see continued use and love. \n\nThey belong to your son and you should\u2019ve had a discussion with him about them before this decision was made. Just because you say you wouldn\u2019t care doesn\u2019t make his feelings are invalid.", "YTA you should have at the very least asked Lex if he was OK with the idea if Cain borrowing some if his old toys and if he wasn't respect it. My parents sold every toy my sis and I ever had at garage sales because they were cheap and acted like they needed the extra attic space. I don't have old toys or baby items. And it's disappointing. I get you can't hang on to every little thing, but those toys were given to Lex and are his property. It should be his decision what toys he's comfortable sharing with his cousin.", "YTA - Your first big mistake was gifting things that don\u2019t belong you, the second one was to not respect the decision of your son.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people promise something to a kid before making sure that it\u2019s even a possibility. You could have simple said: \u201eLet\u2019s ask Lex if you can play with his Drone\u201c\n\nI\u2018m (33f) really attached to a lot of my old toys. Do I still play with them? no, but they accompany in my Life and whenever I take them in my Hands I remember the precious memories we made together.\n\nYou completely ignored the feelings of your son, you did not ask for his permission once, you did not apologize for trying to \u201esteal\u201c his stuff and you made a promise to a little boy that you can\u2019t keep and that can possible strain the relationship between Cain and Lex. And last but not least you gave your own son the impression that his wants and needs are second and only your opinion matters.", "YTA you should have asked and I\u2019m sure he would have agreed to give him some of his old toys, however he probably feels replaced given that this other kid is living in his home and is using his old toys and clearly his opinion is valued a lot more than your own sons.", "YTA. It's called basic respect. Show your son some if you expect it in return", "yta. and op, you came on here asking for everyone\u2019s honest opinion on your actions, and it really seems like you\u2019re dead set on defending your a-hole action than reflecting on the surmounting comments explaining WHY what you did was wrong.\n\ni have books and toys that i haven\u2019t touched in over a decade. i\u2019m almost 24 now. but once i was told by my mom that she gave away my childhood carebear to a cousin that i don\u2019t talk to much and it made me feel hurt. even if objects are not being used, it doesn\u2019t erase the attachment and sentimental value someone will have over that item. you could have easily talked to your son beforehand before being rude and relinquishing the toy right under your son\u2019s nose. or, even better - bought this cousin his own entire toy to call his own. doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s 17, an adult, or older; you don\u2019t just take something away from someone without asking. that\u2019s literally basic etiquette.\n\nit\u2019s a slap to your son\u2019s face, disrespectful, and shows that you don\u2019t care about the way he feels or thinks. why even come into a subreddit asking if yta when it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t think you are and want to spend the time defending your actions to strangers online.", "YTA I'm 35 and still play with my Legos and matchbox cars I'd be devastated if my parents gave them away granted the toys are at my home not my parents but still", "At least the kid is 17.

My brother and Cain's mom deal with some issues. I do have a 17yo son (Lex) and WFH so I have a lot of spare time. \n\nI love having Cain because I get to be a little kid dad again. Lex doesn't seem to mind that Cain basically lives here. Yesterday I took him shopping at Target and he asked me if he could this quad drone. I said I had a better idea. You can have Lex's old drone which bigger! We just need batteries because Lex hasn't used it in like 8 years. \n\nThen it hit me why not give Cain all of Lex's old toys. Legos, action figures, games, etc all collecting dust in the closet. Cain was so happy about it.\n\nWhile I was giving Cain a bath, Cain was playing with some of Lex's toy cars, Lex came into the bathroom and told Cain to pit back his toys  when he's done. Lex was annoyed that Cain was using his toys.\n\nI told Cainto ignore Lex and I'll talk to him. After I put Cain to bed, I told Lex that I gave Cain his toys. Lex said to stop and put his stuff back. I said that he's 17yo and has not touched his old toys in like 8 years. So what if I give them to Cain.\n\nLex said it was still his. I said yes, but you're 17. You don't play with toys anymore. It's fine to let other kids use them. It's not like I took stuff out of his room. I'm not buying something twice if I already have it home. Be a good cousin.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re not a dad to him, you\u2019re the uncle whose watching him. You are a dad to your actual son who could\u2019ve been completely okay with this if only you just asked. Simple, ask him if you could give the nephew some toys. Even if it seems dumb to you, some people may keep toys to give to their future kids, they may just like having them, or they may just want to have them. If all else fails then just let the nephew borrow them while he\u2019s there if it\u2019s alright with your son.", "YTA those are not yours to give away.  ask your son if he doesn't mind Cain playing with them but don't just give something that isn't your away .    yes he is 17 but that is his childhood and maybe he wanted to save them and give them to his kids, or hell sell some stuff.  respect your son and his things.", "YTA.

The way you should've done this was as follows:  \n\n\n\"Hey Lex, I think Cain could have some fun with your old toys. Could you go through them and keep separate any you want to keep for sentimental reasons? Or give me a few I can give to Cain?\"", "YTA, its his toys, doesn't matter if he's 17. He could want them for memories and even if it's to play with them let him. You do not get to decide what he does with his property (sure you bought it for him but you gave them to him so they were his). Be a good dad.\n\nEDIT: Also stop defending yourself in the comments and take the AH judgement.", "YTA. Just because he didn't touch them in 8 years doesn't mean they're all of a sudden not his. They're still his toys. Sure, you may have bought them for him when he was little, but that doesn't give you the right to just give them away without asking him first. There's a reason he held onto them. \n\nYou may give away your things if you haven't touched them in so long, but Lex isn't you, and if he wants to keep his stuff, let him keep his things. \n\nBe a good father.", "YTA My mom did the same to me when I was 18, took my old Lego and comics for her students, all value was lost for my comic collection, and all my Lego sets from the 80\u2019s are missing so many pieces they\u2019re just a pile of bricks now. I was mad at her at the time, and I was mad again when my kids got to the Lego age and I couldn\u2019t give them the sets my grandmother gave (and built with) me. How would you feel if your son gave away your treasured keepsakes because you aren\u2019t using them now? The non asshole way to do this would be to ask your son to go through his toys and set aside any that can be given to his cousin, and another pile of ones he doesn\u2019t mind the cousin playing with, but doesn\u2019t want to give away, and a third pile of those he doesn\u2019t want touched.

Get over yourself and let your son come to terms with his maturity at his own pace. Plus, he may wish to keep them for nostalgic purposes.\n\nAt the end of the day they are **his** toys, which he received as gifts.

You're right, the toys haven't been played with, your child doesn't play like that anymore...doesn't mean it's easy to be told to say goodbye to that time. This was about him being ready to say good bye to those toys, saying goodbye on his accord or when he was comfortable. Why did you have to do ALL of the toys right then and there? They were his things so why didn't he get to choose when he was ready to tell those things goodbye? Have you seen toy story 3 at all?", "YTA. They belong to your son.

Make his parents provide him toys. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to ASK if he can play with your sons old toys but you need to respect your sons property and choices.

Lex is possibly feeling like he\u2019s been replaced by a newer, younger model. You didn\u2019t even ask him if it was ok to pass on some toys to his younger cousin, you just did it. Perhaps Lex has some sentimental attachment to some of those toys. I would be willing to bet that if you took Lex aside and asked him to set aside some toys to pass down, he would\u2019ve. But you just took whatever you wanted, because the little one is more fun and cute and who cares about anyone else?", "YTA, it doesn't matter how long it is since he used them, they're still his. Just because you originally bought them doesn't give you any rights over them. You GIFTED them to your son, so they are his to do whatever he wants with. You have no rights over them. You have, in effect, stolen them from your son. I am 74, and I still have books and stuff from my childhood, which I would hate to part with for sentimental reasons even though I haven't looked at them for years. You're trying to replace your son with your nephew. Return the toys to your son and buy them again for your nephew.", "YTA - but don't worry too much.

You always ALWAYS ask before giving away your child\u2019s things. What\u2019s wrong with you?", "YTA and you know it. You been a deadbeat dad to lex. In which world is it acceptable to give something away that doesn't belong to you?\n\nYou can ask lex if he want to give some of his!!!!! Belongings to his cousin.

Those aren't your toys to give away.   \n\nWhat you should have done is go to your son and ask him if he wants to give any of his old toys to his nephew.   You probably could have both gone through his toys and decided together what to give away.  But the way you presented it was just thoughtless and rude.", "Especially after reading OPs comments, absolutely YTA. You are teaching your son that you have no respect or love for him. You are also teaching that any \u2018gift\u2019 you give isn\u2019t given but only leant, and any space he has isn\u2019t actually his own. This isn\u2019t the kind of person most people want to keep contact with once they have a choice in the matter. When he goes LC/NC, it will be all your own doing. I\u2019m sure this is a pattern of behavior and not a single event.", "Why are you spending time with Cain instead your own son?  \n\nYour son obviously treasures those toys because they are in his closet, if he didn't care, he would have tossed them years ago and used the space for something else.  \n\nYou need to evaluate your relationship with your son", "YTA. At what point did you ASK your son if he was okay with giving his toys away?", "YTA why would you think your son would be ok with you giving away his stuff? Would you be ok with your stuff being taken without your knowledge?", "I\u2019m going to go with a soft YTA\u2026\n\nAs a parent with kids that have received gifts and *literally* never even opened them, I can understand your perspective that the toys would serve a better purpose with Cain. Especially considering Lex hasn\u2019t played with/seemingly gave a shit about them in years. \n\nHowever, as an adult that has experienced tremendous feelings of sadness regarding the loss of their childhood items, I can empathize with Lex and recognize that just giving his stuff away without even a conversation beforehand was wrong. \n\nYou still have time to fix this. Talk to Lex and let him know your intentions were good but your execution sucked and you\u2019re sorry. And then work together to preserve whatever toys he wants to keep (you might be surprised to hear they mean more to him than you think) and then see if there are any he\u2019s willing to pass on to his cousin.", "YTA\nEven if your kid isn't playing with them they are his things and you should have asked him first. I'd be pissed. In fact my parents did the same things. Gave me some teddy bears to me then gave almost all of them away without asking.", "YTA.\n\nToys have sentimental value, or are for collection, so you did steal his stuff. Plus I don\u2019t think you watch him close every second to know how much he touch something. \n\nAlso you are basically doing the dad to this kid while not really engage to him, do you really think he is not noticing? Was it really necessary to take all if stuff without asking?", "**YTA** *BIGTIME* \\-\n\nIt's about the *principle* of the thing.

You are telling him that he is in effect a poor beggar who has nothing because everything can be taken away as you please, or even treating him as a possession, since apparently he is not a person who needs to be asked, even though he is almost an adult.\n\nDo you really want to teach your son that he can't have boundaries?\n\nYou should have asked, at the bare minimum.

You gave it up the minute you put it in your closet.", "So your son, nephew and other people have a free claim to any possessions of yours that is located in a closet or cupboard? So if there is a painting on the wall somewhere, other people can claim it since you don't use it? If you have a nice dress in your closet, another person could take it without problem?", "Are you freaking kidding?!\n\nSo every skein of yarn I bought that is putting the closet until I'm ready to use. It is no longer mine? Every time I parked my car in the garage and walked away, it's no longer mine? Something tells me that if somebody tried to pull that on your belongings you would be upset. \n\nPS, yes YTA.", "So I can take everything out of your closet right", "Maybe he put them in the closet so that they aren't sitting out where visiting cousins will be tempted to use them without permission?", "Is there any chance that you could also accept an opinion other than your own?\n\nI have already read several of your replies to the comments here.  And basically you're just repeating your initial post over and over again.\n\nWhy did you ask this question at all if you can't do anything with different opinions?", "You'll get the last laugh when they're old and need help. Off to the crappy retirement home.", "I'm so sorry that your parents did that to you.  They are absolute monsters and you never have to interact with them again if you don't want to.", "I am so sorry you were subjected to this abuse. Some people should not be allowed to reproduce.", "Many of his son\u2019s toys were most likely birthday and Christmas presents from friends and family, so OP had absolutely no rights to them. He has essentially stolen from his son.", "If I haven't used it in 10 years then take it", "I'm in my late 30's and I literally just bought myself a star wars lego set when looking for a different set my nephew wants!", "Lawyer\u2019s answer.", "If I hadn't used it in 10 years, then I wouldn't even notice.", "I said yes, but he's not using them so it can be given away", "Is OP the son posting as his father?", "This.", "I could write a whole book on that idea. I have a family member who has been a judgemental, misogynist,  self-centered ass his entire life. When it came time for placement in a nursing facility, I chose the most urine smelling place that I could find that had the worst reviews. He could have paid for a much nicer place but since I'm poa, that's what I chose. The final straw was when I asked if I could have his old car since he wouldn't need it any longer. He said \"no, sell it and put the money in my account\" I  said \"you would rather the state get your old car than helping me out when I desperately need a new car?  He told me yes, so as far as I'm concerned, he can die in that hellhole.", "See, the nice thing about the scenario is that someone is giving you the choice. You didn\u2019t give him the choice. You gave away his things without even asking. They were not yours to gift.", "Hmm, I don't believe a word of that statement.  YTA", "My dad inherited my grandads old classic car, he had planned to restaure it and after having started he realized it was a much harder task than he envisioned.

You don't dismiss your own kids feelings. \n\nYTA poor kid deserves a better dad!\n\nEdit: also news fucking flash! 17 is still a child! I have toys i haven't touched in years as a 29yo bt i kept in storage which i will pass down to my daughter because her wonderful grandmother who isn't with us anymore got them for me. And stuff my gran got me as a baby! \n\nIt's a shame your own son can't call you a wonderful father who allowed him to do the same because you barely give a shit about how he feels about anything. \n\nGod why even have kids?!", "Not a lawyer, I just pretend to be one on the internet", "Did you come for outside opinions and judgement or to argue with strangers on the internet. YTA and you are likely making your son feel replaced. You even called yourself a little kid dad again when you are not a little kid dad. You are the dad to a teenage son and the uncle to your nephew. I am just hoping you never said anything like than in front of your son. Hearing something like that would probably crush him. You need to do some reflecting rather than justifying.", "but your son DID notice and it bothered him.

You dont get to slight him in favor of Cain.", "I doubt that is correct,  bottom line is that they didn't' belong to you and you should of asked before giving stuff away.   do you think your son has some resentment for you just having no concern to his feelings?  he is 17 going to college next year he may think that he is easily replaceable.  what's next  are you going to give Cain his room when he goes off to school?   sounds like you are giving to much time and energy to Cain and forgetting you have  a son", "Not everyone is the same. Just because he doesn't use them doesn't mean their presence doesn't matter. Many people have toys and figurines as decorations and he may very much enjoy having them on display even though he no longer pays with them.", "You have no idea what your son wanted those toys for. My mother kept all of my toys for me for YEARS - even after I moved out and had nowhere to store them. Because she wanted me to be able to pass on someone of MINE to my own children. You don\u2019t get to unilaterally decide to give away someone else\u2019s possessions and just cause you babysit your nephew doesn\u2019t make you a dad to a little kid again.", "But your son noticed and he cares and you\u2019re completely disregarding his feelings. Your son is allowed his own feelings, which may differ from yours, and you just trampled all over them. YTA. You need to give the toys back to Lex. If, on his own initiative, he decides to sort through them and give some to Cain, that\u2019s his choice. You\u2019ve already gifted them to Lex. That means they\u2019re Lex\u2019s to decide what to do with, not yours.", "Sounds like he does use them then since he immediately noticed.", "ask him in the first place if he would like to give it away.", "That's up to your son, not you. You deciding this instead of asking him, and doubling down on defending yourself in such an infantile manner, is why YTA.\n\nGrow up dude, you need to be a better dad and uncle than this. You are failing both your son *and* your nephew, even if your nephew doesn't realise it right now.\n\nYour son is realising his father is a big untrustworthy overgrown child (in fairness, unlikely that this behaviour is in isolation), and if you don't figure this out fast and grow up you may not have a father-son relationship for too many more years .", "By the same logic, I could just go to my neighbors house, take everything they don\u2019t use anymore and gift it to the homeless.", "Then that would be his choice to make, not yours.", "Only by him if you do it it\u2019s theft.", "I don't even remotely see what you're trying to say or how that relates to what i said tbh", "Can confirm it is a gift\n\nSource: I am also a fake internet lawyer", "sorry the logic OP is using makes no sense.

Your comment is what made no sense. Hop off my thread"]}
