Have your parents never helped you out with stuff (at least once you became an adult) when you needed it without asking for payment?\n\nIf not, then Y-T-A. It's would have been reasonable to ask for payment if they were you to babysit while they went on vacation or something like that. But this was a tragic emergency event. Your parents are actively grieving and also low on money, while raising an 11 year old, and had to just deal with flights (and potential things like funeral arrangements) because one of their parents JUST DIED. \"I should put my grieving parents in even more dire financial straits because it would be nice to be reimbursed for some groceries and a pizza\" is a pretty spoiled and selfish way to think (again, unless you too are in dire financial straits).\n\nDo you want a purely transactional relationship with your parents?

Did they ask you or did they tell you they needed you to watch her and give you no choice in the matter? Why couldn\u2019t she go with?

I wouldn\u2019t be doubling down at the moment and pushing the money issue, but agree they should be acknowledging you for helping them out instead of them determining they\u2019d done stuff for you in in life so you \u201cowe\u201d them. Now you don\u2019t reference what all they\u2019d supposedly helped with by their standards- but you\u2019re barely an adult so anything under the normal responsibilities as required by them as a parent ex: food, clothed, general well-being especially as when you were a minor doesn\u2019t warrant any \u201cowing\u201d- if they had to get a nanny or babysitter last minute surely this would have costed them substantially. \n\nIf it were me given the situation I\u2019d let it go- but remember it for next time.

Siblings are not additional parents. Too many are burdened with the expectation that they MUST \"step in\" when parents are unavailable, out of duty. That creates an imbalanced family dynamic and resentment. What you did was babysitting. It was work. This is not your child.
