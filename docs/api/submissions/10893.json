If they didn't want to pay you the time to tell you that was before not after.  Maybe you wouldn't have bought those groceries or taken the day off work if you knew you weren't going to be compensated.  I don't know how much you were expecting but it's shitty to have pulled a bait and switch.\n\nThat being said, you're a family member not an employee.  People can certainly take advantage of that, but chances are your parents occasionally help you out with things without expecting financial compensation and it's completely reasonable for them to expect you to return the favor on occasion.  I mean if your dad would charge you helping you move or doing minor home repairs maybe you just have a different family dynamic than what I'm used to, but it would seem weird to me to ask my sisters for money if I was watching their kids for a weekend, and I'd only really expect money from my parents for watching my sisters if I was in Jr High/High School as sort of a \"this is how jobs work\" lesson.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult on your own.

Chances are, losing two days of pay makes a huge difference to the OP.\n\nThe parents are also in a tight spot financially, I get that. But the answer is not to lie to their older child about paying them and then renege on that. The parents could have explained their financial difficulties and arranged to pay OP later.", "INFO were you actually scheduled for work the weekend", "INFO: Did the cost of having your sister for the weekend put a severe dent in your financial situation, to the point where it might cause you struggles with rent/bills/necessities? Has your relationship with your family up to this point been exceedingly transactional, or perhaps complicated/unhealthy in some other way? Have your parents never helped you out with stuff (at least once you became an adult) when you needed it without asking for payment?\n\nIf not, then Y-T-A. It's would have been reasonable to ask for payment if they were you to babysit while they went on vacation or something like that. But this was a tragic emergency event. Your parents are actively grieving and also low on money, while raising an 11 year old, and had to just deal with flights (and potential things like funeral arrangements) because one of their parents JUST DIED. \"I should put my grieving parents in even more dire financial straits because it would be nice to be reimbursed for some groceries and a pizza\" is a pretty spoiled and selfish way to think (again, unless you too are in dire financial straits).\n\nDo you want a purely transactional relationship with your parents? Usually this is the type of way that family/friends help each other without thinking or asking for payment, because the idea is that when *you* are experiencing some sort of emergency or need assistance, they'll do their best to be there for you. Because you both care about each other.", "NTA- Babysitting is a job, children are not slaves.", "I feel like you could have handled it better with a specific price before they dropped the sister off.

I totally get where you\u2019re coming from, you lost wages having to give up shifts and fitting your home with supplies for her like \u201ckid friendly food\u201d to watch her on their behalf. Did they ask you or did they tell you they needed you to watch her and give you no choice in the matter? Why couldn\u2019t she go with? Do they commonly dump her on you like this and never pay you for your efforts? They also alluded to intending to pay you but that money is currently tight. \n\nThat being said, one of your parents just lost their parent and is likely grieving. I wouldn\u2019t be doubling down at the moment and pushing the money issue, but agree they should be acknowledging you for helping them out instead of them determining they\u2019d done stuff for you in in life so you \u201cowe\u201d them. Now you don\u2019t reference what all they\u2019d supposedly helped with by their standards- but you\u2019re barely an adult so anything under the normal responsibilities as required by them as a parent ex: food, clothed, general well-being especially as when you were a minor doesn\u2019t warrant any \u201cowing\u201d- if they had to get a nanny or babysitter last minute surely this would have costed them substantially. \n\nIf it were me given the situation I\u2019d let it go- but remember it for next time.

It seems weird to me that your first thought is about money. \n\nThough you're young so I am going to make assumptions that buying groceries and calling out from work might be a bigger financial burden than it might do.

Either way it should have been made clear from the beginning that they weren't going to pay rather than make you think they would and then go back on that.", "YTA and it's not even remotely close.

The absolute least they could do was pay for the food OP had to buy to feed their sister. Parents are being jerks too.", "exactly this. YTA.", "But they didn\u2019t even supply their kid with food for the weekend. Op had to miss work, and buy food for a 11 year old for breakfast, lunch and dinner. She is a 20 year old living on her own. \n\nOp probably took a $400-600 hit in income.

Family emergencies complicate everything, so obviously unless there's done kind of abuse history or them constantly making you babysit without compensation, I think watching the young'un was the right thing to do. HOWEVER, I do think they should at least cover food expenses in a situation like that.", "You don't have to be a millionaire to be able to afford basic food for a child. If she lives in her own apartment and works, I think she could afford that. I don't think that caused a huge hole in her wallet, realistically speaking. Adding up food you fed your baby sister and helping your family during an emergency, especially a death emergency, is really selfish.

I missed that part the first time. OP is majorly TA.", "Ah yeah, fair enough!", "I would be too. When I was that age my little sisters also much younger, stayed for the weekend because I loved to have them. This is so crazy to me.", "Yep it is. If she was financially staple then I would have voted the other way. But right now even older 2 income households would have suffered from taking a financial loss this big. Especially a unexpected loss like this.", "Yes", "Thank you for answering my question.  My judgement is NTA.  While I understand that this was an urgent family situation, you did call out of work, meaning you lost pay for those days and you spent money on groceries specifically for your sister.  I think your parents should at least reimburse you  for the groceries and potentially for your time to help make up for your lost pay."]}
