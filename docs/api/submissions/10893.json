Have your parents never helped you out with stuff (at least once you became an adult) when you needed it without asking for payment?\n\nIf not, then Y-T-A. It's would have been reasonable to ask for payment if they were you to babysit while they went on vacation or something like that. But this was a tragic emergency event. Your parents are actively grieving and also low on money, while raising an 11 year old, and had to just deal with flights (and potential things like funeral arrangements) because one of their parents JUST DIED. \"I should put my grieving parents in even more dire financial straits because it would be nice to be reimbursed for some groceries and a pizza\" is a pretty spoiled and selfish way to think (again, unless you too are in dire financial straits).\n\nDo you want a purely transactional relationship with your parents?

I wouldn\u2019t be doubling down at the moment and pushing the money issue, but agree they should be acknowledging you for helping them out instead of them determining they\u2019d done stuff for you in in life so you \u201cowe\u201d them. Now you don\u2019t reference what all they\u2019d supposedly helped with by their standards- but you\u2019re barely an adult so anything under the normal responsibilities as required by them as a parent ex: food, clothed, general well-being especially as when you were a minor doesn\u2019t warrant any \u201cowing\u201d- if they had to get a nanny or babysitter last minute surely this would have costed them substantially. \n\nIf it were me given the situation I\u2019d let it go- but remember it for next time.

Siblings are not additional parents. Too many are burdened with the expectation that they MUST \"step in\" when parents are unavailable, out of duty.

So long as the daughter has never asked or received help from parents after turning 18 then it\u2019s even.", "The parents should have been truthful.  They are assholes for that.\n\nShe lost two shifts of work, and the parents didn't even leave money for food for their 11 year old child.  They put that financial loss on the back of a 20 year old who is just starting out.\n\nI am wondering what's wrong with the parents' finances if they have to lie and not pay even for their child to eat.", "Depending if they work in a food industry and are a waitress. Weekends are high tip weekends. I live in a rural area and have friends that work as a waitress and it\u2019s nothing on a bad weekend to get $300-$400 in tips. Considering it\u2019s close to income taxes being released it\u2019s very possible it could be $400 plus on tips and hourly rate. Then you add extra food. Food alone for breakfast, lunch and dinner for an 11 year old could easily hit $150. I just went out today and got stuff to make subs, and fries for dinner for 2 people and spent $15.99. There wasn\u2019t any juice, milk, cereal, nothing else.\n\nAnd most waitress dont account for all their tips into taxes. Just saying 30 years ago in a town of maybe 1000 people I waited tables i would easily make $100 a night in tips.", "Yeah. Whatever happened to, \"Don't be a Dick\"?  Otherwise you need to go NC.", "I\u2019d be sad if my parents indicated they\u2019d pay me when I took a few days off work to watch their kid, at 20 years old. You kinda need your paycheck to live independently, pretty sad her parents don\u2019t respect that. They want her to consider their finances though lmfao", "The parents expect their 20 year old daughter to take time off of work so lose income and pay out of pocket to feed and entertain their sister. If you really don\u2019t see anything wrong with that I hope you don\u2019t have kids because I\u2019d feel sorry for the burdens you\u2019d place on them.", "I think it making them miss work was the issue.  Like if OP was trying to financially benefit I think it would be different to them trying to not be financially hurt.", "Why do people on here think that a 20-year-old can afford to take time off work and take care of an 11-year-old for a weekend? I was really poor back then. I rode the bus. I went to the dollar store for groceries. What kind of food do you think I bought from my part-time jobs plural with no health insurance? This honestly sounds like it's coming from conservative news saying that minimum wage workers should all be teenagers and not the reality that it's mostly people who are supporting families.", "They didn\u2019t know it would be zero.", "Copy and paste where OP said their parents agreed to pay anything? \n\nGlad you are not a lawyer\u2026", "My brother came to spend the night and get up early and take a test because the university was closer to where I live when he did. I didn't have a lot of food in my apartment and I didn't even think about that and I was so embarrassed when I came home and he was there. And I'm older and was making a little bit more money than him but I was still working part-time. When you are poor and young and not really qualified to make a lot of money and going to school and trying to support yourself, it is really hard. That sucks when your parents take advantage of it", "watching your sibling during a one time emergency after admitting that no, she does not regularly watch her sibling is a far stretch from \u201cundying loyalty\u201d lmao.", "Eh not necessarily - at 20 I mostly ate super cheap things like rice, flatbreads, and legumes with a lot of chilli sauce for flavour!", "I agree with what you said about parents sacrificing for op. But that was their job. It was their responsibility too do that.\n\nBut my point is that this a 20 year old. A young adult that is probably working in the food industry. And if thats the case weekends are a big tip weekend for her. \n\nI am sure she is paying her own way. And I know a lot of adults in this economy would take a big financial hit. The parents should not pay her for babysitting but they need to reimburse her for what it coast her this weekend.\n\nThey intentionally lied to her and let her believe they would compensate her. Which is so wrong. You don\u2019t lie to someone to get them to do something you know they can\u2019t afford to do. They essentially tricked op in putting herself in a financial bind to help thinking they would help her. So how is that family helping family. They used op. \n\nThey should have been upfront with op from the start giving her the option of making informed financial decisions for her. \n\nAnd like I have said it\u2019s great if you can survive on taking the moral high ground, but when one trip to the grocery store  for 2 people for 3 days could easily run $150.00. And where power bills are running $300 a month. That moral high ground does not pay the bills.", "Taking 2 days off work is the more financially painful part.  When I was around OP\u2019s age losing 2 days\u2019 wages would have made the next few weeks a struggle.", "Two shifts of work was meant to pay bills, but OP gave that up to do this.  The parents couldn't even pay for their kid's food.  Then they shame her for being so spoiled.  WTF?  The parents feel broke, but OP took a financial hit, too.", "She took off work for 2 days, and she feed a 11 year old   Breakfast, lunch and dinners . So she is easily out $400-600. So just because she is doing great for a 20 year old doesn\u2019t mean she is not hurt by a weekend with out pay and a lot of extra expense.\n\n\nAnd like I said earlier everyone saying family helping family. That\u2019s great but have you ever paid the electric, water or rent on morality credit because I honestly don\u2019t think you can.", "That\u2019s ok I enjoy the interaction. So go ahead and bill me. Lol. But all jokes aside. \n\nI am not saying she shouldn\u2019t help her parents. I am saying they should have been up front with her so she could have been more aware to cut her budget as needed. Instead of order pizza she could have made pizza. Instead of calling out for 2 days she may have been able to talk to one of her sisters friends and they could have kept her until op worked.\n\nOp was under the impression that they where going to help her with the coast.\n\nAnd it\u2019s easier for a 40 something that probably have credit and can take an emergency loan can take a hit a lot easier that a 20 something probably just getting started in life. \n\nThe parents should have told op. That right now money was tight but they help her next payday. But instead they blew her off.", "A 20 year old who likely counts on every dollar for basic expenses (or most of her pay, at least) when the favour requires her to take multiple days off? No, she should not be expected to miss that much time for free. And the parents should have confirmed their intentions when the subject was brought up beforehand, thus this is an ESH at best. Yes, the risk is OP would have declined. Too bad. The satisfaction of helping family won\u2019t cover her rent or keep the heat on.", "And not even pay for the extra expenses! OP should be compensated for the time off of work, but not even paying for their 11 year olds food is just bad", "Did you work weekends?", "I'm guessing that you're either rich or didn't work weekends. For a lot of younger people nowadays taking a few days off work means risking homelessness.", "Very good point, very fair. It's just that OP replied in another comment that she wanted more than just reimbursement.", "I have been blasted a lot today because I said the same thing. Given she works weekend my guess she probably works fast food, retail or some minimum wage job. And this is a big hit especially if she works fast food and is a waitress. Weekend for waitresses are a big income boast because of tips. \n\nLike I said in a few post using the notability of family helps family is great till you go to pay the power bill or rent. They don\u2019t take morality credit. And most 2p year old unlike parents in their 40 probably don\u2019t qualify for a personal loan or have credit to take the hit.\n\nAnd most people in their 40 work for companies that pay grievance pay. So more than likely the parents didn\u2019t like income like op did.", "OP said in another comment that she wanted more than just reimbursement, so that went into my judgement. I probably should have been motre clear about this.", "If that's the case, then they could have done favor-for-a-favor or something instead of going on the attack. Like, make OP a nice loaf of bread or something once they feel up to it.", "Well thats on the parents, shouldve been upfront about it being 0 and not leading OP on with the \u201ctheyll let her know when they get back\u201d", "No, I\u2019m not your lawyer but I have passed the bar exam and you haven\u2019t. (And I\u2019m presently pending admission, thank you very much.) \n\nOP stated clearly that when they asked her parents about payment, the parents said they would decide how much when they returned. That\u2019s not great, as it doesn\u2019t specify an amount, but it clearly means \u201cwe will decide how MUCH to pay you\u201d and not \u201cwe will decide WHETHER to pay you.\u201d Very different things and the latter does not meet the spirit of the former.", "Refusing to do petty favors for free is a far stretch from being a sad, selfish family member.", "She said they don't usually ask her to look after her sister. And I get this is a big inconvenience for her. But so is it for her parents, they are already low on money, they are also probably losing money by not working, and they are grieving. This is the time to sympathize. I don't agree with not getting paid because it's family, but is this really the hill to die on?", "I don\u2019t think they have the money to. By the post by op and the comments, OP doesn\u2019t want to be reimbursed they want the babysitter pay and the parents left the younger child with them due to financial reasons, so it would be fairly safe bet to predict you will get nothing and they are just asking for a favour from family not a babysitter.", "That comment specified reimbursement for the groceries, so I think the lost wages might be the issue.", "I was paying bills every other month. And not in full. I lived with mice. I took cash advances out on a credit card. If I could have afforded to take a weekend off work and buy groceries to babysit I would have done it. They appear to be asking OP to go without for this request. I get that the parents seem poor too from going to the funeral but they need to ask a peer more financially stable, not their kid. That is shameful behavior.", "\u201cGrief\u201d, google it.", "I\u2019m just glad none of you are a part of my family. Would make deaths so much harder to deal with, geez.", "Work on your reading and comprehension skills because they are lacking.", "Depending on her financial situation this could be her rent money they are playing with.\n\nThe parents knew she wouldn\u2019t get paid. They lied to her knowing she probably have to work. \n\nYes they are grieving and death never happens at a convent time. But they may have put their 20 year old in a dire financial situation. As a parent this isn\u2019t right.", "I get that also but my biggest issue was the parents just expect a 20 year old to take a big hit. And purposely lied to her to get her to do what they needed instead of doing what was best for her.\n\nAnd she shouldn\u2019t expect babysitting rates she should expect to reimbursed  a small portion of what she lost income wise. Which like I mentioned to someone else depending on what she does for a living babysitter rates may be the cheaper option.", "This 100 percent. I agree. My point is their is no way a 20 year old can recoup from this type of financial burden especially now. I went to the store this morning. I bought stuff to make subs and fries for 2 people and it was $15.99. I had one bag.\n\n\nI will take a financial loss before I would ever expect my kids too.", "And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not part of my family. Expecting young family members to incur extra expenses and lose income without any help. You probably will then say it\u2019s too bad you couldn\u2019t make rent. Should have cut down on the avocado toast.", "You can just admit you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s fine. This is basic first year Contracts class stuff.", "Read the paragraph about money again. Was pretty much \u201cwe are tight on money and we will see what we can do when we get back\u201d. They couldn\u2019t do anything.", "Parents should never ask their kids to go into debt for them.", "Don\u2019t worry, they will pay it forward when their parents cover them for their travels to see them\u2026oh wait they are dead\u2026", "This is a family member asking someone a favour to watch their kid not a business deal. You have no clue what you are talking about, why are you pretending to have passed the bar and created a fake life for yourself for reddit? It\u2019s a bit sad, get some help.", "But instead of apologizing they decided to call her a spoiled brat and insulted her. That goes to show how much they appreciated her sacrifice.\n\nAnd the parents should have been up front and told op the truth from the start. If op told them she could not take the financial hit then one of them should have stayed home. Would that have been a sucky situation yes but it would have helped there financial situation also.", "Nope and given she is 20 leaving on her own I feel there is so much more to this story then she is saying.", "You\u2019d be surprised how much of Contracts class is about personal/family agreements. One of the most famous cases is about a grown child who was supposed to receive money at age 21 if they refrained from certain things (drinking, swearing, etc). It\u2019s not a class on business. You take Business and Corporations for that. (And it\u2019s generally second year. It\u2019s often on the Bar but unlike Contracts, not a \u201ccore\u201d topic and not tested consistently. You would only answer questions on it on the essay portion, not the multiple choice.)\n\nAnd no, it was never a favor. They had an oral agreement for payment. OP probably wouldn\u2019t recover much since the amount wasn\u2019t specified, but the parents clearly violated the agreement.", "Because\u2026 she is. Someone just died and she is asking for money as soon as they saw them after their trip.", "Seems like they have a bad relationship at the very least. We did the best we could - has been yelled a few times.", "Let\u2019s look at the facts: \nNothing was agreed to. \n\n\nI rest my case.\n\nAlso are you using a fake account to try and be a star on r/iamverysmart ?", "Like I said I have lived payday to payday. I have been in the position if I don\u2019t come up with $300 in a day my power will be shut off. And if she works somewhere where she gets tips that could be a very big possibility. she was counting on those tips this weekend to pay rent to pay water but thought ok mom and dad will give me the money i missed when they get back. \n\nMy point. Is She may not be entitled or spoiled she may be desperate."]}
