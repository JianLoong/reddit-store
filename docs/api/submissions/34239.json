It was a lot of fun going out with them. We built a Whats App group to chat and set the dates. Usually we talked about cats because each one of us has at least one cat. \n\nFor many years, my country has been flooded with refugees from eastern countries like Iraq and Syria. There\u00b4s always been a debate if we should let refugees in the country and that this would lead to more crime. I\u00b4ve never felt that way. I think every nation, religion, colour of skin or whatever differences there may be, have good people and bad people. Therefore, I divide people into criminals and not criminals, good character and bad character, nothing else. I don\u00b4t care if your a citizen or a refugee or what religion you have. \n\nA year ago, there has been an incident at one of the refugee homes near where my friends live (all six women live in the same area). A refugee got angry with another refugee (both young men) and attacked him with a knife. I wouldn\u00b4t have known about this incident but my friend wrote it in our Whats App group. She wrote something along the line that refugees are all criminals and they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to live near schools because they kidnap and abuse our children. I had never heard about anything like that and immediately wrote that I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s nice of her to say that all of them are criminals. It\u00b4s definitely not true. There are so many cases of child abuse and harassment of women from citizens of my country. In addition, all bad encounters which I had (unfortunately many) were never with refugees or men other than citizens of this country. \n\nHowever, she went on that those refugees are stealing the money from our people who need and  deserve it more and that they even got more money from the state than our people that didn\u00b4t work. Of course I told her that this isn\u00b4t the case. She didn\u00b4t back off though, saying she has to work hard for the little money she got and they would get everything for free. Just to clarify this: she lives in a house that her parents inherited her, a big house with 5 bedrooms and huge garden. She worked part-time, earning about 2000$ every month that she could spend on anything as she didn\u00b4t have to pay rent. She has a nice car, three cats, a fully furnished house and so on. So clearly the refugees aren\u00b4t taking away anything from her. She then started again saying they were criminals. By that time I had enough and brought up statistics that I got from a government site. I sent the links to the Whats App group and then left the group. Shortly before this incident, I had adopted a young woman who is trans. My friend was all like \u201eoh that\u00b4s wonderful, trans people are humans, too\u201c. After I had left the group, she started posting stuff against trans people (my daughter is trans) on her status and that friends should respect other opinions and I wasn\u00b4t a good friend.

Of course not. How can you even ask?", "NTA. I am actually having a bit of grief because I just broke up with a friend group I have been part of for around 20 years. Recently, abortion and marijuana issues were passed in Ohio. Our friendship ended because I support both of those things. And (gasp) I have a marijuana license already.   \n\n\nThis group and I met when our daughters were in kindergarten. They girls are 23 now. This friend group has always differed from me in politics, but we just avoided it. At this particular dinner one of the women stated she did not think she, as a nurse, should be forced to perform abortions on people if it were against her religion. I asked what if the mom\u2019s life was in danger. She thought if there was a heartbeat it was not her right to stop that. The conversation went from there.\n\nWe had been through, divorces, spouse deaths, surprise pregnancies. I am going through a BRCA journey right now. I had a double masectomy a few weeks before this dinner on a Thursday. I had necrosis and was actually having bleeding. I was having more surgery the following Monday. (All is well now.) But, not one of my so- called friends even texted me. We text at least every other day. Radio silence since the beginning of December. I know intellectually I have not done anything wrong. But, I could not listen to the narrative that abortion is murder. \n\nIt is just hurtful that apparently an unborn baby is worth fighting for and a 20 year old friendship can be discarded.   \n\n\nI am not debating abortion with anyone.", "NTA.

Applied to everybody it promises great rupture! Friends falling out over headlines. This was one person in a circle of eight. In such things, all duckies are seldom in a row.", " Nta", "NTA. I've done the same with a former friend who suddenly turned totally rightwing and racist. Our values turned totally opposite.", "NTA, you made the right call to ditch, as it sounds like she's falling down the Fox \"news\", and GB \"news\" cesspits.", "NTA, and in fact it sounds like you dodged a bullet. Who needs a 'friend' like that? I'd ditch whoever is defending her too.", "This is going to end with them banging... I wish I could say differently, but if she doesn't call her boyfriend when having a mental health crisis but calls your boyfriend, that's a big issue. I get it if they are fighting, and that's the reason for the crisis. But calling on a vacation is a little much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't feel bad about having integrity regarding your own values.", "NTA, cut out racists whenever you can!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't have a difference of opinion with her, she wasn't expressing an opinion, she was just sprouting hateful comments that weren't true. Then she refused to revise her beliefs or to at least consider not arguing with you when presented with objective evidence that they were unfounded. It would be different if she's accepted the facts or at least hadn't argued persistently.\n\nAn opinion is something like which pizza is best. It's perfectly reasonable to disagree on say pineapple on pizza and still remain friends. Open bigotry and demanding other people participate by not pouring the cold water of facts over you? A lot of folks consider that a deal breaker.\n\nAlso the fact that she immediately went anti-trans in response is a huge red flag.", "NTA but honestly it just feels like you\u00b4re looking for affirmations and online pats-on-the-back here, \"AITA for cutting out that evil racist person from my life reddit? :( uwu she was so mean to helpless people so I had to believe in my values of helping people and respecting everyone, am I baaad?\"   \nSo NTA in this situation but kind of self-righteous and attention seeking in general.", "NTA this person is no loss to your life, block her on everything and suggest your daughter do the same", "That really hurt when I read her status.

But I agree with her there. She should be allowed to step back and let a colleague assist.", "Wow. That must have hurt like crazy - the friendship and the medical issues. Hope you're doing better and can find new friends with your freed up time.", "I\u00b4m so sorry to hear that!!! At least I\u00b4ve only had this group of friends for 4 years, but it still hurt. So I can only imagine how devestating this must have been for you. \n\nI hate debating abortion because I can\u00b4t handle if someone says it should be forbidden. I know someone (not close to me, but a sister of a friend\u00b4s boyfriend) who was pregnant because of abuse. She didn\u00b4t know where to turn to and tried to abort the fetus herself. This ended in her death of course. An unborn baby shouldn\u00b4t be more important than that woman\u00b4s mental health.\n\nYou\u00b4re going through a lot and I hope you\u00b4ll get through this somehow. Thank you for sharing your story with us!", "I guess values are different from other things. Like you can think cats are cute or you don\u00b4t like them. Nor reason to unfriend someone.

If a crime happens they always write the nationality of the criminal in the article, but only if it isn\u00b4t a citizen of this country. If a citizen commits a crime, they just wirte \"A man/woman has stolen something\". So it seems that only foreigners commit crimes. People tend to get fooled by it.", "Actually I have, so I lost 8 friends at once. Now I\u00b4m trying to build up new friendships and I\u00b4m being really careful and I ask about their values first.", "I\u00b4m not sure what this has to do with my post?", "Ahh the paradox of intolerance. Is it okay to be intolerant of intolerant people?\n\nYes. Yes it is. We'd all be better off if everyone had the courage to speak up when hateful people go off. Silence is acceptance.\n\nAnd if you spamming facts makes your friends uncomfortable, they can look away. The issue didn't concern them. When my friends get rowdy in the group chats & I don't have time or interest in the topic I just silence it for the day. Advise the whiners to try that next time they're made uncomfortable by life getting too real for them to handle.", "I think you are NTA and were right ending the friends hip but your friends might be right about spamming with facts. It is counterpriductive to put too much facts into a groupchat. Most people are not interested enough to read them and would get iritated at you for expecting that they spend to much time on something they don't want to do.", "NTA - opinions don't affect facts. Facts should affect opinions. Posting links to statistics that prove her wrong isn't 'spamming' her with facts... it's demonstrating that she is wrong and providing the evidence to back it up - something she can't do. Her behaviour since demonstrates the type of person she really is, so you shouldn't be concerned at all. Good on you for removing that kind of toxicity from your life!", "Thanks for putting it into words for me. That\u00b4s exactly what I was about: being intolerant of intolerant people! \n\nAnd you explained it very good. I think you\u00b4re right. I pretty much always speak up when someone is discriminating (I have to for my daughter\u00b4s and my colleague\u00b4s sake). Gets me into a lot of trouble though and sometimes I\u00b4m not sure if it\u00b4s worth the trouble. It\u00b4s tiring. But you\u00b4re right, silence won\u00b4t change anything!", "I mean. Pick your battles and protect your mental health. I'm not saying it's ALWAYS worth it. It can get heavy. But if it's a social group you actively hang out with... Ya. Shared values are important, IMHO."]}
