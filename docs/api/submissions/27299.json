This comes with the territory of dating someone from another country. It's important to meet her family and experience her culture and travel is the way to make that happen. Unfortunately travel is expensive, so you should be planning ahead. That being said if your boss says no, that's obviously out of your control. You need to discuss this with your gf and figure out when you'd be able to make this happen.\n\nEdited to add: You probably shouldn't be dating someone whose country you fear. Justified or not, this person has family, roots, culture, and history there. She is actively engaged in all that and wants to live a life that includes her country. How can you build a life with someone and not embrace her background? If you're planning for children, would you want them to be cut off from half their culture? For that I'm going to go YTA. The first part still stands, but since your comments indicate that the real problem for you is that you don't like her particular country I think you should probably do some real thinking and discussion about what a future with her would look like and whether that's something that would work for both of you.", "NAH\n\nBeing the new guy at work asking for two weeks off is never really feasible sadly\n\nBut shutting that idea down completely (is that what happened?) is not really nice either. \n\nOf course it is important for her that you meet her family and see where she grew up at some point. \nYou surely understand that.\n\nMaybe you could find another point in time when it fits everybody's circumstances better?", "I live in a neighborhood near 3M HQ in Minnesota and it's full of engineers and scientists from all over the world.  No one bats an eye over travelling to Asia to see family.  My advice is to do it when you can - explain to your boss that you need to do this for family, and if you get pushback, ask if making the trip later would work.  But DO go.  If you haven't traveled, you will gain a new life experience, and you will like China.  There is no better way to visit another country than to do so with others who live there.  Forget any notions you have about lame tourist trips - visiting and staying with locals is the gold standard of great travel.", "It seems like there is more to this story than just china.\n\n1. OP has apprehensions about rules he read online about china (which is fair considering he hasn't traveled at all). \n\n2. OP isn't too serious about GF is my take, he has issues with her past and isn't considering her long term relationship potential. \n\n3. Point 2 leads him to believe spending half his savings to travel to a country he isn't comfortable with and/or is paranoid, for a person he isn't very sure of is what's the issue.\n\nOP - this may be a good time to evaluate your stand with your GF. So you can save $3000, save your paranoia and also let this girl find a better partner for herself.\n\nI forgot to add YTA", "If you're serious about the relationship then in-person introductions to each other's family are very reasonable. This isn't changed by the fact that in your case this is made more difficult by geography. The discussion should be more about *how* (and *when)* you can afford the tickets and other expenses, and *how* to manage to take the time off. (It's totally reasonable of you to want to accrue time first - and maybe you have to. It's also totally reasonable to start talking with your boss about needing to take a 2-week foreign trip vacation for family reasons in the next X months / year.) \n\nYou telling her that you don't think it's not a good idea really falls short. If you seriously value such a trip less than, say, a two week vacation of your choice (hiking? hunting? surfing? beach? whatever it is you normally do or would choose to do), then you should engage a conversation of what the two of you expect from the relationship. If your answer is \"a good time with no long-term commitment\" and hers is long-term family planning, then please break up sooner rather than later.", "Maybe when you get married to her.

If you aren\u2019t, then break up.", "Are you serious about this woman or is she just a convenience for you?\n\nIf you're serious you need to go but negotiate the timing because of your new job. Getting involved with someone from another country means visiting their family when you're serious. If you're not serious, break up with her, you're wasting her time.", "Need more info tbh. She is giving you quite a lot of notice if you have already started the job and you want to book something off a few months later. Does that mean you will be 6 months into a new role and taken no leave? \n\nIn a few months is Xmas which is a natural break for some (or heavy period for others) which can also factor in.\n\nI also wonder how this discussion unfolded to be a problem enough to post on here.", "YTA: Given her culture this is a HUGE step for her to want you to meet her family.  It also says a lot to the family if your not willing to meet them.  It is a sign of disrespect not to mention a sign of less that \"pure\" intentions towards their daughter.  Jobs come and go, but this is a person that you are supposedly testing out building a a life with.", "China is a very fun place to visit in my experience, especially when a local is guiding you. The airfare will be expensive but staying there won't be. Make plans with her, go, and have fun. And if you can't, accept that this is not the partner for you. She's from another culture and wants to share that with you. If you aren't willing to participate in that it's unfair to her.\n\nYTA because you're dismissing it out of hand when this is a very important part of your relationship and will need to be done.\n\nHowever, it doesn't need to happen this year, when you're at a new job and it's not an ideal time.

Are you in it for the long haul, or is it just a short-term thing with no expectation of future marriage / kids, etc or is it just too early to say?\n\nMeeting her family in China would likely be setting groundwork on future marriage.", "From comments, it sounds like she sprung this on you pretty last minute, is not really listening to you opinion at all, and you don\u2019t really have a ton of expendable cash or flexible PTO at the moment. \n\nThat being said, I completely get why it is important for her, and if this is a serious long-term relationship, you should be trying to find a compromise. And for the fears about China, if you want this relationship to last, you\u2019re gonna have to get over it. \n\nCould you maybe ask her to plan a date a bit further in advance, built up some experience at your new job, save some money, research different flight options, and go when you\u2019re more prepared? \n\nGonna go with NAH, but could easily be E S H depending on how stubborn you both are about it.", "NAH. \n\nDo you have to go for the full two weeks?

Don't tear down any posters you see hanging. Don't try to hand out any religious or political pamphlets and you'll be fine.   \nAs for getting time off for work, if you ask long enough in advance, your boss will not have an issue with it. You just have to decide if your gf means that much to you and if you see a future with her or not because if you do, you need to be prepared to make the trip at least once. Just having her do video calls with her family is not good enough. Take a step back, and imagine the roles being reversed. If your family were overseas and you haven't seen them. You were in a serious relationship that you believe is moving towards marriage so you want to talk to your family about or see them before you do and let them meet the girl you want to marry but she is refusing to go simply because of what she's \"heard\" from social or lamestream media. How would you feel? You'd have to be second guessing how serious that person is about your relationship. You're using your job as an excuse and it's seriously a WEAK one.

Just because you have the cash doesn't mean you can afford it. \n\nIt depends on what he means by \"available funds.\" If that means total savings than hell no he is NTA for not wanting to spend that. If that $6k is \"fun money\" then I can see why it would be down voted.", "Yeah but if it\u2019s like half of your life savings going on the trip then that\u2019s pretty foolhardy to spend half of all of your money on it. If he only has $6k that\u2019s basically an emergency fund for OP should anything happen. Plus the plane tickets are $3k usually people splurge on vacation too so it\u2019ll most likely cost significantly more than $3k.

A year is solidly long enough to be a more serious relationship but also not that long at all in the grand scheme of stuff.
