This comes with the territory of dating someone from another country. It's important to meet her family and experience her culture and travel is the way to make that happen. Unfortunately travel is expensive, so you should be planning ahead. That being said if your boss says no, that's obviously out of your control. You need to discuss this with your gf and figure out when you'd be able to make this happen.\n\nEdited to add: You probably shouldn't be dating someone whose country you fear. Justified or not, this person has family, roots, culture, and history there. She is actively engaged in all that and wants to live a life that includes her country. How can you build a life with someone and not embrace her background? If you're planning for children, would you want them to be cut off from half their culture? For that I'm going to go YTA. The first part still stands, but since your comments indicate that the real problem for you is that you don't like her particular country I think you should probably do some real thinking and discussion about what a future with her would look like and whether that's something that would work for both of you.", "NAH\n\nBeing the new guy at work asking for two weeks off is never really feasible sadly\n\nBut shutting that idea down completely (is that what happened?) is not really nice either. \n\nOf course it is important for her that you meet her family and see where she grew up at some point. \nYou surely understand that.\n\nMaybe you could find another point in time when it fits everybody's circumstances better?", "I live in a neighborhood near 3M HQ in Minnesota and it's full of engineers and scientists from all over the world.  No one bats an eye over travelling to Asia to see family.  My advice is to do it when you can - explain to your boss that you need to do this for family, and if you get pushback, ask if making the trip later would work.  But DO go.  If you haven't traveled, you will gain a new life experience, and you will like China.  There is no better way to visit another country than to do so with others who live there.  Forget any notions you have about lame tourist trips - visiting and staying with locals is the gold standard of great travel.", "It seems like there is more to this story than just china.\n\n1. OP has apprehensions about rules he read online about china (which is fair considering he hasn't traveled at all). \n\n2. OP isn't too serious about GF is my take, he has issues with her past and isn't considering her long term relationship potential. \n\n3. Point 2 leads him to believe spending half his savings to travel to a country he isn't comfortable with and/or is paranoid, for a person he isn't very sure of is what's the issue.\n\nOP - this may be a good time to evaluate your stand with your GF. So you can save $3000, save your paranoia and also let this girl find a better partner for herself.", "If you're serious about the relationship then in-person introductions to each other's family are very reasonable. This isn't changed by the fact that in your case this is made more difficult by geography. The discussion should be more about *how* (and *when)* you can afford the tickets and other expenses, and *how* to manage to take the time off. (It's totally reasonable of you to want to accrue time first - and maybe you have to. It's also totally reasonable to start talking with your boss about needing to take a 2-week foreign trip vacation for family reasons in the next X months / year.) \n\nYou telling her that you don't think it's not a good idea really falls short. If you seriously value such a trip less than, say, a two week vacation of your choice (hiking? hunting? surfing? beach? whatever it is you normally do or would choose to do), then you should engage a conversation of what the two of you expect from the relationship.

If you aren\u2019t, then break up.", "Are you serious about this woman or is she just a convenience for you?\n\nIf you're serious you need to go but negotiate the timing because of your new job. Getting involved with someone from another country means visiting their family when you're serious. If you're not serious, break up with her, you're wasting her time.", "Need more info tbh. She is giving you quite a lot of notice if you have already started the job and you want to book something off a few months later. Does that mean you will be 6 months into a new role and taken no leave? \n\nIn a few months is Xmas which is a natural break for some (or heavy period for others) which can also factor in.\n\nI also wonder how this discussion unfolded to be a problem enough to post on here.", "YTA: Given her culture this is a HUGE step for her to want you to meet her family.  It also says a lot to the family if your not willing to meet them.  It is a sign of disrespect not to mention a sign of less that \"pure\" intentions towards their daughter.  Jobs come and go, but this is a person that you are supposedly testing out building a a life with.", "China is a very fun place to visit in my experience, especially when a local is guiding you. The airfare will be expensive but staying there won't be. Make plans with her, go, and have fun. And if you can't, accept that this is not the partner for you. She's from another culture and wants to share that with you.

And for the fears about China, if you want this relationship to last, you\u2019re gonna have to get over it. \n\nCould you maybe ask her to plan a date a bit further in advance, built up some experience at your new job, save some money, research different flight options, and go when you\u2019re more prepared? \n\nGonna go with NAH, but could easily be E S H depending on how stubborn you both are about it.", "NAH. \n\nDo you have to go for the full two weeks?

Don't tear down any posters you see hanging. Don't try to hand out any religious or political pamphlets and you'll be fine.   \nAs for getting time off for work, if you ask long enough in advance, your boss will not have an issue with it. You just have to decide if your gf means that much to you and if you see a future with her or not because if you do, you need to be prepared to make the trip at least once. Just having her do video calls with her family is not good enough. Take a step back, and imagine the roles being reversed. If your family were overseas and you haven't seen them. You were in a serious relationship that you believe is moving towards marriage so you want to talk to your family about or see them before you do and let them meet the girl you want to marry but she is refusing to go simply because of what she's \"heard\" from social or lamestream media.

Because most of China is safer for some tourists than the US.\n\nThere are area that are either closed to tourists or more  risky (xinjiang, Tibet as always\u2026).\n\nMy SO used to go regularly for work. \nOne of my colleagues goes once a year because his wife is Chinese and he really enjoys spending time with her family.\n\n\nFor the holidays, we\u2019ll, I\u2019m European so taking 2 weeks is not an issue and I\u2019m always flabbergasted that Americans accept to be treated this way.", "I mean, you can. But there are good reasons and bad reasons. And if they are bad reasons, it\u2019s probably good for you to know that they are bad reasons so that you can work on yourself and what you want out of a partnership in the future.", "Not necessarily and tbh your response made me raise my eyebrow. Just because you have the cash doesn't mean you can afford it. \n\nIt depends on what he means by \"available funds.\" If that means total savings than hell no he is NTA for not wanting to spend that. If that $6k is \"fun money\" then I can see why it would be down voted.", "Yeah but if it\u2019s like half of your life savings going on the trip then that\u2019s pretty foolhardy to spend half of all of your money on it. If he only has $6k that\u2019s basically an emergency fund for OP should anything happen. Plus the plane tickets are $3k usually people splurge on vacation too so it\u2019ll most likely cost significantly more than $3k. So OP would be spending probably like 60% of his money on this trip", "Are you people fucking crazy? It\u2019s half of his savings. The \u201cbetter things\u201d are more likely shit like food and rent and you\u2019re all making it out to be like he\u2019d rather buy a PS5 and tickets to the Super Bowl.", "Yes. I\u2019m the asshole for not wanting to go somewhere that my own government has advised me not to go. How is that Sinophobic? You can look it up for yourself online and see what the warnings say.", "Yet you let your gf think you were serious about her; that's the only reason she wants you to meet her family.\n\nYou should've been honest with her before, that you're not interested in a serious relationship and broken up with her before. \n\nI hope by now you've been honest with her and broken up.", "Yet you still can't bring yourself to be honest with her.....\n\nYTA", "That\u2019s really not so long, but perhaps your partner thinks this is a serious relationship and is ready for commitment. If you aren\u2019t, don\u2019t waste time and get out. If you\u2019re are, explain that you should save some money, get better situated at work and then travel. Maybe take some time to learn more about china and her culture to calm your nerves. \n\nDo not move forward if you aren\u2019t serious about the relationship or it\u2019ll be harder down the line.", "Honestly I can see why you\u2019d be apprehensive. A year is solidly long enough to be a more serious relationship but also not that long at all in the grand scheme of stuff. I would add this that you\u2019ve been dating around a year and the trip would probably cost more than half of all the money you have along with the work constraints. It\u2019s pretty important context imo", "It's nothing to do with \"being poor and not seeing the world\"....\n\n\nIt's that you don't seem to appreciate your GIRLFRIENDS (!) Country..... Family...... Culture..... Feelings......\n\n\nYou won't even TALK TO HER!", "I grew up poor and didn't see the world, I grew up, saved money and travelled on my own. I am not judging you for your lack of travel, but your whole over all anxiety around \"loss of documentation\" is what is bothering me. You are overthinking this!", "If this is a deal-breaker for you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that so long as you see it for what it is and move on. If you try to continue the relationship thinking that you\u2019re never going to visit her home country that would 100% make you TA.", "Race? \ud83e\udd14\n\nYTA", "Yeah honestly, I\u2019d say NAH and I\u2019m usually pretty harsh. But it\u2019s cause you can\u2019t make a travel boyfriend out of someone who simply doesn\u2019t wanna travel & that\u2019s ok! If a guy was against planes, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s a 10, he\u2019d be a 2 to me cause I couldn\u2019t be with someone like that. The opposite is also true though & being with someone from another country means embracing that country. If you can\u2019t do that, there\u2019s no future and she should be with someone who can embrace traveling back home with her.", "Bluntly. Not much is being asked of you. But if you find that too much then agree that moving on would probably be best for all concerned.", "It was more or less just sprung on me. I said I\u2019m a little anxious about the idea and she didn\u2019t really hear me out.", "Specifically what are you afraid of? There are always warnings to go to places. People still do it and are fine. You need to consider the risks that you are acceptable with.

Millions of people travel to China annually.  It's probably one of the safest places to go it would be problematic if you did something to piss of the government.", "I think you should try your girlfriend who's from there, if she says it's safe enough to travel. \n\nOn a side note totally unrelated, a friend's mom traveled to China last year (the woman is 75 years old) and went with a couple of her friends (all senior people) and it was alright.", "My SIL moved to China alone when she was 18. She recently visited home and stated unequivocally that she's staying in China and never wants to return home permanently. \n\nYou're scared about nothing.", "Yeah you\u2019re not crazy. People just don\u2019t keep up with international affairs. I wouldn\u2019t go there right now either.

This reply was insanely helpful. I appreciate that you gave me some stuff to think about while not criticizing me for having some reservations. Thank you.", "Easy to say that when the situation is entirely hypothetical. Not to easy when you need to actually pay the money, turn over your passport (yes, that\u2019s what you need to do), and go.", "I no longer desire to hear about the million other boyfriends she\u2019s had in her life.

Way out.", "But OP doesn\u2019t want to go at all and hasn\u2019t presented a scenario of \u201cI\u2019d like to save up more money to comfortably afford this\u201d.

And what specifically is there advice?", "I\u2019m sure she will find someone else with no problem so she\u2019ll be fine.", "Okay, I\u2019ll own that.", "Who mentioned race? I grew up in the countryside on a farm and have barely spent any time in a city. She\u2019s only lived in major cities until recently. That\u2019s a pretty big difference, and it has nothing to do with anyone\u2019s race.", "I appreciate this reply. You\u2019re one of the few who looked at this with a very reasonable lens. You\u2019re right about me, I\u2019m just not the type of person who is ever going to be a world traveler. Maybe she\u2019s better off with someone who is.
