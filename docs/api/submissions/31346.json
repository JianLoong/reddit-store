Although we are not married, we live in my house. We were discussing marriage options, though.\n\nThe issue is, as my parents are getting older and I had recently moved to the USA, I wanted them to remain together with me (and so did they). I offered to bring them here, and they were agreeable to the idea. But I did not want to leave them alone or to just get a house for them like that, so I asked them to live with me.\n\nWhen Alice heard about it, she was against the idea. SHe said that I can't just invite someone else to live with us, and I told her that it was not just \"someone else\" and that we are talking about my parents. She said that she does not want that, and asked me why I am even doing it. I told her \"Well, they are my parents, and I want to look after them. I am not asking you to do that either.\"\n\nShe protested by saying that I am valuing my parents more than her and asked me to just get them to an old age home or something. I lost my temper at that and  told her to mind her own business, and that it's against my values to just abandon my parents once they get old.\n\nIt resutled into a full-blown argument, and in the end I told her \"I get to decde who lives in my house, so don't interfere in my affairs\". She's now sour with me and is not talking to me, but I wonder whether I did anythng wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700499437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zt27f/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_get_to/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if this is how you treat her about her living situation,  what else are you holding over her head? YTA.", "Dude. She's gonna dump you and move out.

Yes, it is technically your house and your feelings are understandable, but the fact is you are moving two people who will need a certain level of care into the house that you share with your partner.

You wonder about that? \n\n **YTA.**\n\nIt may be your house. That may give you the raw power to authorize your parents to stay. But your partner has wants, desires, needs, and feelings too. And it would be a ***huge*** shock to suddenly go from living with a partner to living with them and their parents.\n\nYou didn't even discuss it. You just decided you had the power to do it and did it. Then you basically told her to shut up when she voiced concern.\n\nIt may very well end up being you living with your parents with no girlfriend in the picture.

If your parents move in, they will be a big part of your, and your gf's lives. You are unilaterally making that decision that will effect both your lives under the guise that it is your house so she has no right to the decision. \n\nDepending on how strong of a person she is, or perhaps her finances, I'd be surprised she doesn't end the relationship, or at least move out, if you go through with this. \n\nAre you the AH for wanting to help your parents? No. \n\nYTA for telling your gf she has no say because it is your house, even though the decision will directly affect your relationship.

You live together and are talking about marriage.  You should make these decisions together.

Yeah, she gets to have some say on who lives with her.  Sounds like you get to have the girlfriend or you get to have your parents.", "YTA, you can make all the decisions as you are about to be single again. It's your house, but your ex-girlfriend lived there too and deserved to get a say. It will impact her live too and as much you pretend you will be the one to take care of them, most likely a lot of the care would have fallen to your ex-girlfriend. And this is someone you wanted to get married to? You didn't even respect her enough to discuss this with her.", "YTA. That relationship is doomed if you think it's your house so you just do whatever you want without consulting with your partner.", "YTA and probably r/amitheex also", "YTA Sure you might be legally entitled to decide, but I hope you understand that you just ended your relationship with that power move.", "YTA.\n\nIt may be your house, but this is about the relationship you BOTH have. You are not only bringing your parents to live at your house. You are bringing your parents to your relationship. They will live with you AND her. They will share space, meals and every moment you will have, including future children. If you want your gf in your future, she should be included in this kind of decisions. \n\nYou are not an asshole for wanting to take care of your parents. But YTA because you decided this alone. YTA because you dont accept your gf can have an opinion about this. YTA because were very rude towards your gf.\n\nHonestly, if you keep having this kind of opinion (about \"my house, my decision, i can bring whoever I want in here, you have no say in it\") I hope she dump you.", "YTA. Not because you want to take care of your parents - you get to decide that! - bit by the way you turn what is a cultural difference into a fight. At least that's what I glean between the lines. Cultures vary enormously in how they handle responsibilities for aging parents. And if you want to have a lasting relationship you work on bridging differences and consensus building.\n\nIf you regularly give partners the alternative to submit or break up with you you'll either end up with a poor doormat as a wive or none at all.", "YTA LMAO you\u2019re text book definition of a bad partner.

You can't just change your household without her consent and expect her to suck it up. This is a major red flag to her. \n\nOfc it's up to you to decide who lives there.

It is the home of both of you, regardless of ownership, and if you\u2019re considering marriage, you clearly anticipate her being a permanent part of your life.

I get for you that it's not an option to want them to go somewhere else, but really you had to have known you wanted to do this before she moved in and you should have let her know your plans so she could decide accordingly. Since you haven't, you should have let her know before inviting your parents. You should have had a conversation that hey it's non-negotiable that I help my parents out and they live with me, and gave her a timeframe on when this would happen so that she could make plans to move out if she wants to.

I offered to bring them here, and they were agreeable to the idea. But I did not want to leave them alone or to just get a house for them like that, so I asked them to live with me.\n\nWhen Alice heard about it, she was against the idea. SHe said that I can't just invite someone else to live with us, and I told her that it was not just \"someone else\" and that we are talking about my parents. She said that she does not want that, and asked me why I am even doing it. I told her \"Well, they are my parents, and I want to look after them. I am not asking you to do that either.\"\n\nShe protested by saying that I am valuing my parents more than her and asked me to just get them to an old age home or something. I lost my temper at that and  told her to mind her own business, and that it's against my values to just abandon my parents once they get old.\n\nIt resutled into a full-blown argument, and in the end I told her \"I get to decde who lives in my house, so don't interfere in my affairs\". She's now sour with me and is not talking to me, but I wonder whether I did anythng wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We have no idea how she may have reacted if he\u2019d discussed this with her previously.", "Not only that but many adult women want privacy in their own home with their partner. \n\nAlso if they plan on raising children then a lot of in law interjection is often understandably unwanted. \n\nIf it works for some then great, but it\u2019s absolutely ok and understandable to not want to spend many years under the same roof as your in laws or even your own parents.", "\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02", "Just dump your girlfriend, it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t care about her opinion on the matter, and she will be miserable if your parents do move in. \nYta", "Do they already know people? Have transportation?\n\nTouring will take a few weeks, tops. Then what?", "stay at a friends house and start making demands saying its you living space", "If she wants an equal say then she should contribute.", "Oh really?  What was OP's girlfriend's response other than an unconditional veto?  Seems like it was just that, a complete dismissal as her opening position.\n\nIf OP had asked first, would her response have been any different?  I don't think so.  The girlfriend is a guest, since she hasn't bought an equity stake in the house nor is married to OP, so she has really no position to try and veto OP's choices.  If this were a dealbreaker for OP, which it sounds like it is, he did the right thing by bringing this conflict to the surface early.", "traditional?", "How was that gaslighting?", "if you think putting them in an elderly home or not taking care of them when they are old is ok you dont care about your parents", "The \"my house, my rules\" generation is dying, luckily. Obviously OPs parents raised him that was acceptable and his partner should definitely reevaluate dating someone with aprons strings this thick.", "Never lived with a person that would suggest I put my parents in a home rather than with me in my house, happily.", "Maybe if you co-own the home but until then she has no say. They\u2019re not married and she\u2019s not respecting his values either", "She would have reacted the same way, trying to tell him to put his parents in an old folks home that would be more expensive than having his parents live with them all for her comfort. My thing is how would that affect her comfort? Sounds like she doesn\u2019t know his parents well to even judge if they\u2019d be a nuisance in her life. If I\u2019m OP I\u2019d reconsider the marriage talks and start considering ditching her. The pros of his parents moving in with him far outweigh the cons of them not living with him", "She's not a friend crashing on the couch for a week. She's a long term romantic partner that he asked to move in with him at some point. She lives there as a permanent resident who supposedly is in a relationship with him, though you couldn't tell it by his actions.\n\nDoes he have the legal authority to make this decision? Sure. But that doesn't mean he isn't an asshole and isn't a selfish, shitty partner.", "Big difference. If a friend said \"oh hey, want to come live with me?\" and has you move all your stuff in and literally live there, then yeah, you *could* say it's your living space. She's not crashing on some mate's couch, she's *living there*. Don't be intentionally dense.", "Then he can find somewhere else to stick his dick cause she needs to bounce and find an actual adult to date.", ">in southamerica caring about your parents is the norm", "Not everyone is in a position to be a full-time caretaker to their elderly parents. Its ignorant to not understand that.", "Maybe it's not a great place where you live, but my grandparents had to be moved to a home because my aunts/mom were running themselves raw taking care of them (gma had dementia and needed round the clock care) and they are both so much happier in the home! They get their meds on time, someone makes sure they eat, their living space is always cleaned, and when family visits (which is daily!), they get to actually VISIT and chat vs taking care of them. I do live in Canada, so maybe the homes here are different than where you are.", "Again, missing the point by a mile...\n\nHe can do as he pleases when it comes to the care of his parents. The issue is that he decided this without discussing it with his gf, or letting her know prior that this would happen.\n\nOP's choice can be a dealbreaker for both of them if they want, but the point is that this should have been clearly discussed beforehand instead of an out of the blue \"my parents are moving in.\"", "could say putting your parents in an elder home is traditional, for the us", "It\u2019s also ignorant to think that moving in your parents means full on round the clock care. Many people don\u2019t need that level of care.", "Maybe you\u2019re missing the point by a mile, it doesn\u2019t matter what she thinks. It\u2019s his parents and his house. If she was considerate of his values then she should have known it could happen. She was not considerate of his values and is only thinking of herself. He let her know that\u2019s what was gonna happen and she didn\u2019t like it. I get your point, you\u2019re saying he should have discussed it with her first, I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t matter what she thinks so therefore there\u2019s nothing to discuss. There is no logical point in why his parents shouldn\u2019t be allowed to live with them unless she has something to hide. She still has her room, she can still go places, if they end up having kids they got free babysitters, free maids, free cooks, they don\u2019t have to spend thousands on caretakers at a facility that will likely treat them like sh*t, the pros outweigh the cons by far. Maybe he should find someone that actually considers his values", "Exactly, what\u2019s your point?", "Many people do though. Its extremely common for elderly people to need extensive care, not everyone can quit their job to take care of their parents. This is why people end up in assisted living situations. Claiming you dont love you parents if you're not the one doing all the care is ridiculous."]}
