Although we are not married, we live in my house. We were discussing marriage options, though.\n\nThe issue is, as my parents are getting older and I had recently moved to the USA, I wanted them to remain together with me (and so did they). I offered to bring them here, and they were agreeable to the idea. But I did not want to leave them alone or to just get a house for them like that, so I asked them to live with me.\n\nWhen Alice heard about it, she was against the idea. SHe said that I can't just invite someone else to live with us, and I told her that it was not just \"someone else\" and that we are talking about my parents. She said that she does not want that, and asked me why I am even doing it. I told her \"Well, they are my parents, and I want to look after them. I am not asking you to do that either.\"\n\nShe protested by saying that I am valuing my parents more than her and asked me to just get them to an old age home or something. I lost my temper at that and  told her to mind her own business, and that it's against my values to just abandon my parents once they get old.\n\nIt resutled into a full-blown argument, and in the end I told her \"I get to decde who lives in my house, so don't interfere in my affairs\". She's now sour with me and is not talking to me, but I wonder whether I did anythng wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700499437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zt27f/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_get_to/", "score": 1915, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, it is technically your house and your feelings are understandable, but the fact is you are moving two people who will need a certain level of care into the house that you share with your partner.

You wonder about that? \n\n **YTA.**\n\nIt may be your house. That may give you the raw power to authorize your parents to stay. But your partner has wants, desires, needs, and feelings too.

You just decided you had the power to do it and did it.

You are unilaterally making that decision that will effect both your lives under the guise that it is your house so she has no right to the decision. \n\nDepending on how strong of a person she is, or perhaps her finances, I'd be surprised she doesn't end the relationship, or at least move out, if you go through with this. \n\nAre you the AH for wanting to help your parents?

Yeah, she gets to have some say on who lives with her.  Sounds like you get to have the girlfriend or you get to have your parents.", "YTA, you can make all the decisions as you are about to be single again. It's your house, but your ex-girlfriend lived there too and deserved to get a say. It will impact her live too and as much you pretend you will be the one to take care of them, most likely a lot of the care would have fallen to your ex-girlfriend.

Not because you want to take care of your parents - you get to decide that! - bit by the way you turn what is a cultural difference into a fight. At least that's what I glean between the lines. Cultures vary enormously in how they handle responsibilities for aging parents. And if you want to have a lasting relationship you work on bridging differences and consensus building.\n\nIf you regularly give partners the alternative to submit or break up with you you'll either end up with a poor doormat as a wive or none at all.", "YTA LMAO you\u2019re text book definition of a bad partner.

I get for you that it's not an option to want them to go somewhere else, but really you had to have known you wanted to do this before she moved in and you should have let her know your plans so she could decide accordingly. Since you haven't, you should have let her know before inviting your parents. You should have had a conversation that hey it's non-negotiable that I help my parents out and they live with me, and gave her a timeframe on when this would happen so that she could make plans to move out if she wants to.

Although we are not married, we live in my house. We were discussing marriage options, though.\n\nThe issue is, as my parents are getting older and I had recently moved to the USA, I wanted them to remain together with me (and so did they). I offered to bring them here, and they were agreeable to the idea. But I did not want to leave them alone or to just get a house for them like that, so I asked them to live with me.\n\nWhen Alice heard about it, she was against the idea. SHe said that I can't just invite someone else to live with us, and I told her that it was not just \"someone else\" and that we are talking about my parents. She said that she does not want that, and asked me why I am even doing it. I told her \"Well, they are my parents, and I want to look after them. I am not asking you to do that either.\"\n\nShe protested by saying that I am valuing my parents more than her and asked me to just get them to an old age home or something. I lost my temper at that and  told her to mind her own business, and that it's against my values to just abandon my parents once they get old.\n\nIt resutled into a full-blown argument, and in the end I told her \"I get to decde who lives in my house, so don't interfere in my affairs\". She's now sour with me and is not talking to me, but I wonder whether I did anythng wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At the moment the family unit is not you + your parents, it's you + your girlfriend.

You both need to sit down and talk. You will say that for you it's important that your parents live with you. She will say her piece - she probably doesn't feel comfortable living with two strangers (I mean who would) and she is thinking about all the ways you'll be inconvenienced. You're not an older couple with a well settled routine, either: you're young, childless, you are still defining what your little family unit means. Two older people, regardless of how lovely they are, are bound to disrupt that bliss. How are you going to be intimate with your girlfriend? I wouldn't be comfortable having sex in the same house as my in-laws, maybe she isn't either? What if she just wants to step out of the shower in a towel and walk half naked through the house, why should she not be able to do that? What if she wants to watch a film but your parents need the volume low because they're going to bed? What if she wants to get drunk one night and dance on the kitchen table, will your parents not judge her?\nHave you considered all of these factors?\nThis may all be ok with you, but it doesn't need to be ok with her.\n\nThe reality is, if you'd had your parents in before you met your girlfriend, she wouldn't have moved in. You may still be together, but it would have been a different relationship and you probably wouldn't be considering marriage, because your family unit would be you+your parents and she's not comfortable with that, not yet at least.

You see how they treat the people they love and you know they\u2019ll treat you the same if they love you. \n\nMy husband loves his family. He respects them as people and love them to bits.

He handles it like a champ though and doesn\u2019t leave me behind while he tended to his mom. \n\nI complained to my mom and she said it\u2019s good that he loves his parents and is super patient with them but also never leaving me out of the equation. She told me to see it from his parents\u2019 pov too. And to treat his parents like how I would treat her (my mom). It was really the best advice because I could understand where he was coming from, where his parents were coming from, and what I could do and slot myself in that dynamics. \n\nI\u2019ve been married for 19 years now and he\u2019s still the same wonderful son that he was back then, but he is the most awesome husband and father to myself and our kids. He loves us a lot and to him we rank top on his list of priorities. He would do anything to make us happy. And we love him too and would do anything to make him happy. He\u2019s happiest being a caretaker so we encourage him to do that. He sees his parents a few times a week so they aren\u2019t lonely. Sometimes he brings the kids along but more often than not he\u2019ll see them when the kids and I are busy so that when we aren\u2019t busy we can have family time with him. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t dream of telling my husband to not care for his parents. I think that would kill some parts of him and would make him really unhappy. He cares for my mom and brother and sister the same way he cares for his parents too. Once you get into his heart, you\u2019re there to stay and he\u2019ll do everything in his power to make sure you\u2019re okay and thriving and happy. \n\nSo I\u2019m glad my mom gave me really great advice when I was 19.
