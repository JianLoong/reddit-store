We got married 2 years ago and bought a house when we were both 20. Back story to all of this drama. My MIL has never liked me my husband also has two older sisters who also don\u2019t like me. 3 years ago when we first got engaged there was a huge fight in between everyone. It was honestly my fault. My SIL and I used to be very close and somehow I got ahold of her phone and saw somethings that ruined everything. It turns out that I thought everyone in my husbands family liked me since I took them everywhere and babysat for them turns out they talked about me in a group chat.  it was so bad that everyone went no contact with each other. They all blocked me off of FB and would share things about me which it\u2019s fine I just ignored it. A year and a half ago they apologized and I said it was fine. Things now are hitting the fan I\u2019m about to give birth but I refuse to allow his family in our home. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t meet our baby but it\u2019s our first child I just want my mom and husband with me. A few days after birth we can meet somewhere so they can meet the baby but I just don\u2019t want them in our home. My husband supports me 100% he\u2019s always had my back but my mom is telling me that I\u2019m acting like a brat. AITA?\n\nEdit: I used apologized and forgave in my post but it wasn\u2019t really an apology and forgiving. The apology was my MIL and SIL contacting my husband again and inviting us to their house. I forgave by setting clear boundaries that we would travel to see them but I wouldn\u2019t want anything to with them sort of thing. I still don\u2019t have them on social media nor do I communicate with them. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn\u2019t the AH we even said that we could take our girl to see them I just I want to be able to control how long we are there for and when we can leave. I\u2019m not trying to keep our baby away I would never do that.", "created_utc": 1671800165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zteleo/aita_for_not_allowing_my_husbands_family_in_our/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s really extreme. Potentially you are also at fault, but even if that is the case, you make the rules for who is invited into your home, who meets the baby, when they meet the baby, and under what circumstances. \n\nYour husband is on the same page as you so I really don\u2019t see what the issue is. Both parents agree about the terms. Your mom has no say here.", "NTA  \n\n\nThey have a long and storied history of being two faced lying jerks to you.  DNA is no excuse for their piss poor behavior, and this is the natural consequences of their actions.", "NTA you and your husband agree that they are not welcome in your home that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not up for discussion or negotiation. It sucks that they have to wait to meet the baby but that\u2019s the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA. In my honest opinion You have every right to choose who is gonna be with you during the birth of your child, as well who will be in your house after it. Your MIL is acting like nothing ever happend, which is kinda funny, considering what she and other did to you. \n\nIf I did any mistakes in my comment, please write them. I am still learning english. \n\nHave a nice day!", "NTA. I will never understand this urgency to see a newborn with little immune system. You're the parent, and it's flu season.

It\u2019s the acceptance of the apology (presumably to make peace), without moving on. No one would blame you for not being close to any of them again and keeping them at arm\u2019s length but it seems like your punishing them. Own that and admit you didn\u2019t actually accept the apologies.\n\nESH\n\nThey are fake, now you know.

They shouldn't be in your house.\n\nHonestly I think you should tell your mother she either needs to have your back or it's just going to be you and your husband. If she's not actually supporting you it's worth having her around, given that you're on the internet entirely because she's twisted you up", "NTA- It\u2019s your baby, your home, your show. Your rules. Doesn\u2019t matter what people think. This is how you feel right now. I hope your relationship with your in-laws improves with time, but for now, this is how you feel. They may be wanting to mend things now that there\u2019s a child involved. I\u2019d suggest being open but cautious. Congrats!", "NTA. People who cycle in and out of estrangement are exhausting and you have a right to keep that mess away from you. It\u2019s so bewildering for the partner whose family isn\u2019t like that too. Like wtf??? Your willingness to travel to them to meet the baby is more than enough given the history.", "EDIT: Op's update is a fair compromise so NAH.\n\nEither you've forgiven them or not. If you have and you want the relationship to improve, then this would be taking 2 steps back. Set a time on the day they can come see the new born and then send them on their merry way. You don't have to see them. Compromise.", "I'm going to go with a soft AH here. Either you've forgiven them or not.

You don't have to see them. Compromise.", "Just want to agree with this and emphasize YOUR MOM HAS NO SAY HERE (plus the say she's trying to have is wrong.)

Now it's your turn...", "Your house, your rules. NTA", "Your English is better than most native speakers I know.  Well done!", "Indeed, and why would you want to risk your baby's health for people who actively despise you?", "Not to mention that is she doesn\u2019t sound like a super nice person either. Imagine calling your child a \u201cbrat\u201d to their face! Even if it\u2019s true, you accomplish nothing by using an insult instead of talking in an honest and unbiased way. And OP has not even done anything to warrant the insult. Sad that neither grandparent knows how to behave properly", "Yup. If you want to protect yourself and your kid, you shouldn't have someone around who truly does not think they need to respect you", "Compromise is letting them see the baby. She gets to do so in a way that makes her feel more comfortable. Or they can not see the baby. She isn\u2019t the one who owes amends, they are.", "Yo, this makes me think the poster really should tell her mother to establish distance. I get that she's young and that is why they're boundaries are skewed, but this is her time to set boundaries with her mother otherwise her kid is going to get troubled by it", "She's excluding them on the day of birth. In many cultures that's a huge thing. Just thinking long term it's not the wisest decision. Tbh this is an issue for the partner not the OP and if the partner also has no qualms about it, then fair enough. The family should be taking it with him but naturally they'll blame OP and not the son.\n\nJust to clarify I'm not talking about during the birth! Everyone can get lost during, I'm talking about after but on the day.", "NTA.  The fact that your husband is behind you 100% should be very reassuring to you that you are not the AH here.\n\nI think your position here is very reasonable and mature on your part.  Your mom many not agree with you but that's fine, she doesn't have to.  Like the old saying, \"You agree to disagree\".\n\nKeep your boundries and congrats on the upcoming birth of your child.", "NTA \n\nThey are a bunch of 2 faced AH and it's good to keep a distance from them all.", "INFO: How did you afford a house at like, 19 years old", "NTA Do not let them in. People like that do not change", "NTA \n\nThe last thing you need is a toxic atmosphere around you as you give birth. Your inlaws sounds pretty toxic to me.\n\nOne person and one person only decides who enters that birthing suite, YOU. You decide, it's what makes you happy and comfortable.\n\nYou decide who can enter your home. Your husband backs you up. They are lucky you even agree to take your baby to see them after how they have treated you.", "NTA You are an adult, you set your own boundaries with people who are clearly not your friends. Your mum is wrong to decide that you should allow these people into your home and allow yourself to become a victim. Why would she think it is okay to allow bullies into your home? You may need to set some boundaries with your mum, if she thinks other people can be allowed to treat you like dirt.", "Nta", "NTA. And your mom is being toxic by forcing you to let things go when they haven\u2019t made amends yet and you are at your most vulnerable", "Nta.  I am about to move and have done a lot of soul searching.   I don't want my extended family in my house.  They are not bad people but they have different energy than me now.  I don't want that in my sanctuary.  I will have a little from immediate family,   but it's a lot different having one person's bad energy vs 20.", "NTA - even without that backstory you would be well within your rights to not have them in the house when you are giving birth or when the baby is new. With the backstory it becomes even more important that you have your own space and boundaries. Good for you and your husband for setting boundaries and sticking to them. X", "Forgiving isn't forgetting. It's not automatically wiping the slate clean. She can move on and release the emotional baggage without wanting to dive right back in.", "Who has the right besides the parents to immediately see the baby after it is born?", "I'd say no one really it is different for everyone for some, immediate family don't want to be as involved. Here they clearly do but are being ushered out. \n\nI guess I just don't like children / babies being caught in the crossfire.  \n\nHopefully one day this will just be in the past (the animosity) but the grandparents not being there will forever be etched in everyone's memory.", "They aren\u2019t in the cross fire. Also even if their relationship was good doesn\u2019t mean op would be comfortable still them coming that soon.", "NTA, tell your mother to stay in her lane and, if she\u2019s gonna open her mouth, maybe she should, you know, support **her kid**, not people who treated her so horribly.", "NTA and why wouldn't you keep your child away from these people?  I understand how difficult nc would be for your husband, but I wouldn't let them visit or baby sit or have sleep over nights.  I wouldn't let them see your child without YOU being present.", "NTA. As long as you and your spouse are on the same page everything is fine.", "INFO: How did you accidentally go through someone else\u2019s phone?\n\nAlso, your own mom is saying you\u2019re a brat, that\u2019s surprising. What is her reasoning?", "NTA for how you reacted with your ILs as they should not be talking bad about anyone as I would probably react the same way. You are the asshole for invading her privacy. \"somehow I got ahold of her phone\" and once you did get ahold of her phone, you decided to go through it to see what she talks about (maybe even her internet history) therefore INVADING her privacy.", "NTA", "NTA. After all that they did, i think it's very generous of you to permit your husband's family to see your child at all. This part breaks my heart:\n\n> It turns out that I thought everyone in my husbands family liked me since I took them everywhere and babysat for them turns out they talked about me in a group chat.\n\nIt's very sad that they walked over your kindness. When you had your hand out in order to be family, they smiled to your face and laughed at you behind your back. I'm glad that your husband is on your side.\n\nAnd I'm shocked that your mother sees fit to call you a \"brat.\" They didn't even apologize by any standard of the word! By any chance, did your mother put a lot of pressure on you growing up to always forgive and be kind to people and not hurt feelings? If so, then i think that going forward you need to not take her advice seriously. (Maybe it's projection, but researching the \"fawn\" trauma response might put some things in perspective.)", "If hubby's on board, that's all that matters.\n\nNTA", "Info - You SOMEHOW took her phone and SOMEHOW went thru her chats and... ?", "NTA, your mum is wrong", "NTA. But be prepared for your mom trying to force a reunion and bringing your ILs into your home when your husband isn\u2019t there.", "NTA. Kudos on your boundaries.", "You are all AH's, except your mother. If they are in your home, you get to set all the boundaries. How is your relationship going to heal if you won't allow basic interactions. I agree with your mom, give it shot. Nothing like being the bigger person. If it goes badly then implement this rule. Sometimes you have to be the more mature one.", "NTA: they ruined the relationship they have no right to be in your home if u dont want them there... your husband backs u so thats all that matters", "Mil, not mom.", "NTA\n\nTell your mother to stay in her lane. This is not her business.", "Tell mom she can put in a timeout too. It\u2019s none of her business. NTA", "Sounds like my dad's ex wife. She divorced him after he found out about her cheating on him.", "NTA", "I\u2019m just curious, what exactly is the right thing to do in this situation for the in laws? \n\nIf her in laws hated OP, and said that to her face, they would be assholes for bullying her. \n\nIf her in laws hated OP, but kept it to themselves, like they did here, they\u2019re assholes for being two-faced liars.\n\nAre the in laws just expected to unconditionally like OP no matter their personal feelings, just because she\u2019s married to their family member? At the end of the day, their feelings are their feelings, and it sounds like they were pleasant and nice to OP before she snooped. They hated OP but went out of their way to be nice to her anyway. Now they\u2019re assholes for privately acknowledging they don\u2019t like her?\n\nEdit: I want to clarify I\u2019m not defending anyone. I\u2019m just genuinely curious because it seems like a no win solution for the in laws. Either like this person I want to marry or get of my life.", "Neither one has a say but I was responding to the last part of OPs post where she\u2019s says her own mom is trying to get involved by calling her a brat for making these rules. Her mother\u2019s opinion on this is irrelevant."]}
