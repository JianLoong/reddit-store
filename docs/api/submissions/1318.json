Because this \"tradition\"  sounds more like a weak story they concocted so it's convenient for them to invite themselves into the birthing room and get their hands on your baby right away.\n\nIsn't it normal for the pregnant person to refrain from too much travel during the final few weeks?  And isn't the OB-Gyn or midwife, and birthing place usually pre-arranged so it is nearby?\n\nWell, maybe you shouldn't have called it dumb, but it kinda is dumb.  \n\nIs there some reason why having your baby born in that particular country matters?

So depending on what country he can choose to stay in that country with your newborn and there would be nothing you could do about it.  \n\nSo call me cynical what most see as a strange family tradition I see as a way to take a newborn away from a parent or as away of making her stay in his home country. Especially since this is a weird family tradition to begin with and he just now conveniently told you about it. \n\n\nIf you do decide to agree to go I would check discreetly with a lawyer to see what would happen if he decides not to let you return with the child.

I chuckled while reading it.\n\nEdit: I see people telling you that you should've been nicer or not called it dumb - I would counter that expecting a pregnant person to travel to a different country and give birth with a medical team that you've never met is plenty of reason to throw out insults. \"Dumb\" is nice.", " NTA this IS dumb. Like you\u2019re going through enough creating another human, why tf are they insisting you travel to another country (is it your native language?) to pop out a kid with some doctor you haven\u2019t been working with your whole pregnancy.\n\nAbsolutely insane. The only time I saw this happen was an old classmate from a super wealthy family in another country returning to the US to give birth, then flying back home to her native country once the baby was like 2 months.

It also shows a lack of consideration for the health and comfort of you and your baby. \n\nI mean how long before the birth are you expected to go there? Since it\u2019s not safe to travel long distances after a certain point in pregnancy. And you would probably want to actually meet the doctors who would be there while you give birth.

Instead of having time at home to recover, bond and establish a routine with baby, are you going to be a long term guest, or stay in a hotel? \nAnd for how long after?

Second of all, every country on earth that I know of has citizenship based on your parents. Again, most have it *only* based on your parents and you can't just birth tourist your way into being a citizen even if you wanted to. If OP is a US citizen for example then her child will automatically also be a US citizen, same if she was a German citizen or whatever else, regardless of where the child is born. However, she will have to fill out a whole bunch of annoying paperwork with the US embassy to get the equivalent to a US birth certificate and then a US passport to travel so that would suck.   \n\n\nWhat is much more concerning than the baby's citizenship though are immigration and custody laws and this is the real reason why OP should not do this under any circumstances. Because if the child is born over there and her husband simply refuses to move back home or let her leave with the child, she is stuck - and only if she is lucky enough to be allowed to stay based on her marital status. If anything goes south in the relationship (like they have a fight because she wants to go back home as they originally agreed they would) and he gets a divorce, she could be deported and her child would stay there as it's their residence and her home country will have little power or interest to get involved in an international custody battle not on their soil.", "I kind of went to this also. More like my mind went back to the previous posts of one woman asking if she was the asshole for refusing to move to Pakistan and the other one where OP tore up her daughter's passport when she found out her ex was attempting to take her to Pakistan and had bought no ticket for return. Oh, and no one told her, either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seriously, reading the comments of the first one I mentioned got worse and worse as you realize that poor OP didn't realize what her husband was trying to drag her into and likely didn't care.", "But you do know that citizenship depends on the parents alone for a lot of countries and not the place of birth?", "Same. My mind just went \u2018oh no, don\u2019t do it!\u2019", "Another good place to check, other than a lawyer, would be your country\u2019s consulate in the country in question he wants you to give birth in", "Her child will still be a citizen of the country she is from. When it comes to most countries mothers pass on citizenship to their offspring.", "Not necessarily. For example if you're an American giving birth, your child is entitled to be an American citizen regardless of where you give birth.", "Not all countries provide citizenship based on where you are born.  In most cases, you are a citizen of the country your parents are citizens of.  The US is actually unusual in that all who are born in the US are automatically citizens.", "Hadn\u2019t thought of that aspect (other than the citizenship nightmare for the kid), but this absolutely could be a power play. Given this type of \u201ctradition\u201d, I\u2019m willing to bet the country he is from would be unlikely to grant women any power regardless of citizenship (don\u2019t think OP said where he\u2019s from).", "That's the problem, that's what he and his family think they're doing.", "OP says that the hospital is in a different country from their residential country.", "Also there is like the whole \"getting there\" aspect. Will she travel while heavily pregnant? Will she travel back a few days after giving birth? Will his family pay for OPs family trip to support OP (female here, my mom would be a must go)? Where all them will stay?", "There's the question I want the answer to, because if it's in a whole other country, then there is no way op is ta.", "OP says that the hospital is in a different country from their residential country.", "Why the negative reply then? Sounds like she very much shut that whole idea down.", "The tradition can\u2019t mean that much to him if he is only now telling her about it now she is pregnant.

All the issues around travelling pregnant, not knowing the medical team, not having her support system, custody issues, the fact that it\u2019s a medical procedure so she gets final day despite all that\u2026 honestly I can\u2019t blame her one bit for blurting out like she did. It was dumb what he said, when he said it and without any thought for her needs.", "But it IS dumb. Do you have kids? You\u2019re not even recommended to fly the last 2 months of your pregnancy. He is asking her to basically spend several months in a country that might have a WORSE healthcare system than where she is, in a language she doesn\u2019t understand, that might be more expensive because she\u2019s not a citizen there, where there may be sexist/racist medical practices that can endanger her life, and so much more. What if she was works? Is she just supposed to drop her job for this \u201ctradition\u201d? \n\nWhat if the baby has medical issues? And they can\u2019t go home right away? Also - when was the last time you saw a NEWBORN 2 week old baby on a flight? Probably literally NEVER because they don\u2019t advise most babies to fly or really leave the house until they get a substantial set of vaccines to protect their weakened immune system and they often need to be old enough to receive them - like at least 3 months. And let\u2019s not forget about mom who needs to recover her body. Flat out she\u2019s staying in that country for at least 2 months before the birth and 3 months after. And that\u2019s if everything goes well.\n\nHow would I feel if my husband called this tradition dumb? I would agree because it is so wildly ridiculous to expect this of any woman, much less one who is undergoing a procedure where they may DIE.", "I mean it\u2019s dumb to expect her to travel to another country to give birth and then travel back with a newborn", "It would have to take a special kind of patience in order to be able to remain polite after husband makes that kind of expectation (demand basically) out of nowhere. He could have told her before marriage.", "There are a million obvious legitimate reasons to not want to.

Because I guarantee you, even if you are insistent that your partner be there, if the doctor says he needs to leave the room, he needs to leave the room because compared to your health and the baby\u2019s health, he *does not fucking matter*. The doctor\u2019s goal is a healthy/safe delivery, and if they are unable to make everything go as smoothly as you want, their goal is to keep you and the baby alive and healthy, not to keep your partner in the room.", "YTA for language. There\u2019s no reason to be insulting, just say you\u2019re starting your own tradition, or something like that.", "He expects a highly pregnant woman to travel to an entirely different country to give birth in a specific hospital, just so he can keep up a family tradition?! Is he insane?! \n\nNTA", "NTA. When your husband squeezes a baby the size of a watermelon of of his body, then he can decide where to do it. No tradition should come at the expense of your medical safety and personal comfort.", "The hospital where I was born no longer exists.", "i don\u2019t know that it was tradition, but more of a necessity. You live in the same area for decades with one hospital or major hospital and that's usually your only option. Is the idea to travel there just for this? No doctor will recommend travel at 9 months. \n\nMaybe just saying oh that's interesting but I'm having the baby here would have been enough.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell him about YOUR family's tradition: The person giving birth decides on the hospital, and stays where her support network is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't give in. Do you speak the language? And: You would be there after birth, completely under the control of HIS family. Because no one from YOUR support network will be there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and for apparently not caring that it\u2019s important to him.\" .. You are fine not to care. This is YOU giving birth, not him. Tell him you will support his hospital choice when HE is the patient.", "NTA. There is ZERO chance in \ud83d\udd25I would leave my country and my doctors to give birth someplace else. Honestly, this would make me question the entire relationship", "NTA, trust your gut", "NTA. Is there a family discount? Go where you feel the best services are.", "NTA. You were the one giving birth, so it should be at the place where you feel most comfortable.", "It would be one thing if you actually live there, but if you have to travel (and it sounds like you would), then yes, it is dumb. And risky.\n\nNTA", "NTA you get to chose where you want to have your medical procedure. Not your husband.", "I'm still married and have been for nearly 20 years. I now (after reading this post) attribute this mainly due to the fact that I did NOT ever try to tell my wife where she was allowed give birth, amongst other things.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. So you thought it was appropriate to demean your husband, his family and their tradition. You are the AH for how you handled it. \nWould you like it if your husband spoke to you like that about something that you held dear. \n\nIt could have just been a conversation as to why. \n\nAlso, as a parent of 4 kids. Me and their mom didn't really care about the hospital but it was all about the doctor.", "I came here for this comment!  OP needs to be careful.", "To be fair, it can also be a massive advantage. My husband is a dual citizen of two countries because his parents brought him up in his dad's native country but he was born in his mum's native country. Now he can choose where he lives and works as an adult without having to worry about visa or residence permit issues. He has more freedom. I am from his mum's country and it would have been much harder on our relationship early on if he had not had dual citizenship because it would have been harder for us to live in the same country as each other. \n\nThis depends on the laws of the particular countries involved - not every country allows dual citizenship so it may or may not apply to OP.", "Has he even thought through the logistics of this? Are you legally allowed to be in his country for multiple months at a time?\n\nSay you do this\u2014you\u2019d need to fly by what? 32 weeks? That\u2019s 8ish weeks being there pre-birth. \n\nAnd then however long it takes you to get an embassy appointment for the baby\u2019s passport to get back home. Does your country even have an embassy in that country that can handle the baby\u2019s passport to get home?\n\nWhere I live at the moment if you\u2019re dealing with the US Embassy that\u2019s going to take two months. I know people with other citizenships that have taken much much longer. \n\nSo on the short side of time you are talking about 4 months. Can you even legally be in the country that long? A lot of countries have a 30-90 day cap on the amount of time you can be there on a tourist visa.", "Some hospitals have been around a while. For example I work for St Thomas\u2019s Hospital and we celebrated our 922 birthday this year!", "Often refugees. A Lot of palestinans are stateless.\nBut there are a Lot of groups and Causes. \nHere the Wikipedia articel.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness", "Yes, probably more than 100000 alone in Kuwait.", "Well I\u2019m not really arguing who the doctor thinks is important. And again, on most cases, the spouse can stay in the room even if it\u2019s an emergency c-section. To be there for their partner. Doctors don\u2019t generally remove the spouse unless they are being dangerous. So yes even if there was a complication then I expected my spouse to be there and no leave my babies side. We had a plan together. Again, the whole point is that the parents are supposed to be a team, not exclude each other from the experience. But in addition to actually having a baby myself, I\u2019ve seen and assisted in many births. Husbands/spouses are generally supportive and involved, as they should be. The women who don\u2019t have that have a much harder time than ones who do."]}
