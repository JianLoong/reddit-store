That's the strangest tradition I've ever heard of.  Since you and he are married, you guys should create new traditions.  Keeping old family traditions instead of what is best for your immediate family seems a bit silly.", "YTA\n\nUnless you have a legitimate reason to not want to give birth at that hospital, it doesn't hurt you to continue a tradition that gives the family pleasure.\n\nYou want to be in the family, right? Act like it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, but I literally lol\u2019d at this post, it\u2019s such a ridiculous situation.", "ESH\n\nYou could have handled that much better.  A little bit of discretion, especially when dealing with touchy subjects such as family traditions, can go a long way.\n\nThat said, your husband prioritizing this tradition over a reasoned choice based on quality of health care provided is disrespectful itself.", "NTA\n\nIt's insane, is he expecting you to travel to a different country heavily pregnant to give birth with no support system and no trusted doctors. Do you even speak the language? What about after, will you just fly back with a newborn?\n\nYeah we shouldn't disrespect traditions, but this one is just crazy.\n\nYou give birth wherever you want. If he wants to uphold the tradition, the time he gives birth he can go to that hospital.", "NTA. Those saying otherwise are a little deluded. No one can or should tell you which hospital to deliver in. \nYou need to feel comfortable with the facilities.\nYou need to feel comfortable with hygiene.\nYou need to feel comfortable with the people. \nIt's fine if the women of his family find this hospital meet their needs, but you shouldn't be coerced or guilted into birthing somewhere you don't feel safe, cared for and happy.", "Info: do you already have an OB/GYN at another hospital and you'd be giving birth with an unfamiliar doctor if you abided by this tradition?  Or is there something about the hospital that's off-putting, like it's janky, too far away, etc?\n\nOr is this a choice between Arbitrary Birth Ward A and Arbitrary Birth Ward B?", "ESH. Your husband for expecting this and not discussing it with you and you for insulting an important (FWIW, I also think is odd) tradition instead of having an adult conversation about it.", "YTA for calling it dumb, yes, because that was rude and unkind and this is your husband and the father of your child. You\u2019re totally not an AH for not wanting to travel to another country an an unfamiliar hospital/doctor to have your child, but yeah, you spoke to him like an AH.", "ESH. Him for expecting you to do so and you for just blurting out that you thought it was \"dumb.\" You could have just said no; maybe explain that it doesn't make sense to you and other reasons why you will not accommodate something he finds important.", "Nta this should've been stated before he came in you", "Because no woman should have to travel to a different country to give birth.  I'm sure it was great for the family members who lived near that hospital, but it is a dumb idea to suggest a very pregnant person travel to a hospital far away for a nonmedical reason.  \n\nAdditionally,  what is the plan for when they are discharged? Travel with a newborn baby who has no vaccinations? Stay with family rather that in their own home while she recovers?\n\nI can honestly say that this would be a hill to die on for me.  It totally minimizes the pregnant person is going through a major medical event and then will not get to recover in a familiar/comfortable location.", "The hospital is in a different country from where we live.", "Lol, since when have hormonal preggo women had tact anyways? But yeah, if it's another country even, then I would call him insane for wanting his wife to fly over just to give birth in the same place as him.\n\nMaybe that's a tradition they should just have their daughters honor (if they even want to), since I don't think it's any of the dudes right to pick and choose where someone has to go give birth.", "Is HE giving birth? No. Only the birthgiver decides on their care team. NTA.", "Except she's the one giving birth. She'll have to go to another country, while heavily pregnant to give birth to continue the tradition. Birth is a medical procedure and pregnancy has risks. His family is upset over a HOSPITAL she will be giving birth in... They care more about the hospital than the added stress flying to another country, away from her support system would be on the pregnant woman. The person giving birth in the hospital they're all hot and bothered about. Unless they're expecting her to move there until she delivers. It's selfish insanity what they're requesting with this 'tradition' (which I'm also betting will be all the kids were born there and now all the grand kids, maybe a grandparent was too but it's not some 100s of years long tradition, it's also probably the local or largest hospital in the area).", "How about the fact that her doctor isn't there or travelling while heavily pregnant is uncomfortable.", "Yeah screw that. He wants to give birth there, then he can get pregnant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh yah, NTA btw.", "How far? Because most doctors won\u2019t allow travel after a certain week in pregnancy. Most pediatricians will also not allow newborns to travel immediately after birth. You would basically need to move there for a few to several months.\nMaybe it isn\u2019t about the hospital but about giving his mom the full newborn experience.", "\"Dumb\" is going to make him defensive. And kind if sounds like you don't wanna do it just because it's \"his family's\" tradition.\n\nHave you explained to him why it is so completely unrealistic? (Although I can't imagine how he doesn't see it). You can't fly at 9 months pregnant...you'd have to go significantly earlier. You'd be working with a team of doctors you haven't been in contact with. Does he plan on flying with a newborn who hasn't been vaccinated? Are you a citizen of the country...how will that affect your medical care there? What if the baby has to stay in the NICU? How much time do each of you get off of work before and after birth?", "How are you supposed to get there?  A long uncomfortable flight?  How safe even IS that sort of a flight late in pregnancy? He's not the one giving birth, so it should be your choice.  Especially if getting there could put you or your baby at risk.  NTA, although you should apologize for the way in which you expressed yourself.  You could have been more tactful in how you put it. Blame it on the hormones.  Totally okay and probably true.", "pregnant women arent even allowed to fly depending how far along they are and you cant fly with day old babies. most doctors dont allow it. you also have to stick around in that country to make sure you are doing okay after you give birth. you would want to be somewhere you are comfortable and he shouldn\u2019t be controlling your birth plan.", "Well, grandmas and aunties also don\u2019t get to choose where their daughters give birth.", "So if this was their daughter, you would want her travelling internationally to an unfamiliar hospital with strange doctors for the sake of tradition?", "Ahem.. It's his child too...", "The question isn't whether or not OP is an AH for having a preference when it comes to her birthplan. The question is if she kinda sucked for blurting out his family tradition is dumb.", "Right, so, surprise, but I agree with you, this is a valid concern, but to dismiss his family tradition by just saying \"it's stupid\" was entirely the wrong way to handle it.", "It may be a different country within a few minutes drive - my husband used to cycle to a different country every Saturday to got swimming from when he was 11 or 12 (didn't know him then but thats what he said)", "Those are valid points. I hope she sees this.", "Honestly, it was enough of an insane request to me that I don't fault her for blurting that out, especially since she is pregnant and probably hormonal. She could say she is sorry for how she said it, but lets be real, him throwing that curve ball out of nowhere I would have been like \"WTF??!\" and probably replied before thinking too.", "No they don't (you are right), what I mean is they might be more inclined to though, since it is their tradition and they are the ones giving birth. Though tbh, I wouldn't blame them for saying no.", "What I am saying is that they would more likely want to do the tradition since it's their family tradition and they are the ones giving birth, so should have the choice of where they want to go. But no, I don't think they should be forced to honor/do it. I also think it's a dumb tradition. Sorry, I came across the way it sounded, I will edit what I meant.", "So? It isn\u2019t his medical procedure.", "He came a big wad in her vagina so he gets to tell her afterwards that she needs to leave the country to give birth or she's rude?", "When he pushes the child out of his vagina, he can choose where he gives birth.", "Right there with you on that.", "She wrote him off without a proper argument or alternative, just called it \"stupid\" Yes, She's an asshole for not taking her partners traditions and concerns into consideration, does she have to do it? no, do she have to agree with it? no. But to blatantly shoot him down, that's uncalled for.", "The whole point of this is that she said his tradition was stupid, rather than posing a valid argument against the tradition, or even saying \"Hey, but I like this hospital better\". No, she just shit on his family tradition, so yes, she's an AH for that. I'm not going to argue politic or ideologies on birth.", "Because it isn\u2019t his medical procedure. She should have just written him off. Just like she doesn\u2019t get to decide where he gets his vasectomy.", "Sure she didn't phrase it well.  But to even ask her to do that is so ludicrous that I don't blame her", "And what if he were to say \"It's not my medical procedure, so I'm not going to pay for it\", and just writes it off.", "It's not ludicrous, it's his family's tradition, there should have been at least a conversation about it. I don't blame her for not doing it either, but it could have been handled better.", "A tradition of such importance should've mattered before he spermed", "that isn\u2019t what a family tradition is bud.", "Right, it should have, and if she knew about it prior to this, then she should have spoken up even sooner.", "I guess I just find it exhausting when someone takes offense to your phrasing or your unprepared reaction when they know what you mean. She shouldn't have said \"dumb\" it's demeaning. But we're adults here and we honestly cannot be so sensitive it's a waste of time . I think we also can assume he's probably mad because she said no not just because of the phrasing."]}
