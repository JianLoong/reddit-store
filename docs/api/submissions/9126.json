Even more so because of my first corporate job, where I was the last to be given time off during holidays or summer, because I was a single woman without children.\n\nWhen I started at my current job, I made the decision that I was not going to get to know anyone. Colleagues will stay just that, colleagues. So I arrive at my desk at 08:45, I'm out the door at 5, I take my lunch break outside the office, don't take my breaks with the other, refuse all invites to things outside work ..\n\nMy new colleagues got the hint when I just said \"no thank you\" when they would invite me, when I opted out of the secret sant even though it was obvious that I celebrated, and when instead of going to a colleague's wedding, I RSVPd no, then sent a gift. They leave me alone, I leave them alone, but we are friendly and am happy to lend a hand when needed.\n\nThen this woman started with us almost 3 months ago. She is very outgoing and social, made friends with the whole office within the first week, and seems to take it as a personal challenge that I do not talk about my personal life.\n\nAt first, I was direct but polite, I told her \"hey colleague, I appreciate that you want to get to know me, but I am an extremely private person, and do not like to mix my professional and personal life together.\" After taking her aside away from others.\n\nWell, instead of backing off, she doubled her efforts. And it's not in a creepy way, or a way that would allow me to go to HR, but I do not like it.\n\nFinally fed up with her, instead of trying to redirect the conversation, or changing the subject, I just stare at her -dead in the eye- without saying anything. \n\nYesterday she came by my desk, and asked if I had plans this weekend, I said yes I do, but didn't elaborate. Then she asked me what my plans were, and if I had someone special that I was going to spend my time with. So I just started her dead in the eye and said nothing for minutes. At first she was annoyed, then she started rambling, then she turned red and left in a hurry.\n\nAnother colleague sitting close by gave me this disappointed look and told me that they understood I was a private person, but that that was no way to treat someone who was genuinely friendly, someone who was trying to include me in the social life of the office.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675532538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tmag5/aita_for_the_way_i_respond_to_my_new_coworkers/", "score": 3828, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You volunteer every weekend.  \n\nThat said, work friends can be real friends and you should consider letting people who are genuinely kind in.\n\nEta no I don't really mean say you have a dying child.  I mean it is kinder to say something that is untrue than to stare at someone and refuse to answer them.   It is rude to ignore them.  It is better to just rinse and repeat I don't want to talk about my personal life.

To an outsider, her questions sound completely normal. Your stare sounds like someone creating a hostile work environment. For her.\n\nYou are very lucky that she's not a vindictive person because you have handed her your \\*ss on a silver platter by treating her this way in front of witnesses that like her and are neutral about you. No one is going to care that you both walked away from that conversation upset. She was being \"socially normal\". You were being \"mean\".\n\nI want to repeat. I am on your side. She \\_should\\_ take a hint and back the f off. But society rewards extroverts and you are not going to win this. Enjoy having the backing of Reddit, mine included, but understand that not one of us face the consequences of your actions. You do.\n\nMy advise if you wish to continue to disengage from your work colleagues: document everything with date/time and incident and then learn to talk with her in as boring a manner as possible. In other words, don't give her stuff that leads to a follow up question. Her: \"Got anything special planned this weekend?\" You: \"Not really.\" Her: \"My plans are blah, blah, blah.\" You: \"Well I hope you have a lovely weekend.\" Or maybe Her: \"Surely you're doing something.\" You: \"Nope! Just a quiet weekend.\" You don't owe her even the slightest detail of your plans, even that they are good ones you're excited for.\n\nFinally, it sounds like you're not getting close to your colleagues so you won't be put last on the list for breaks and first on the list for covering for others (plus the money \\*sigh\\*). That's a sign your other workplace was f-ed up. Pay attention to your current workplace and see if they are behaving the same. You may not need to be so vigilant about hiding your personal details. And if they are just as bad, you might want to find another job any way. As the \"least liked\" person in the office, you're going to get the short end of the stick anyway.

Remember the rest of your coworkers have no idea that you've pulled her aside to discuss your boundaries and they probably have no idea how often she's harassing you.\n\nSo to them it can easily seem like you're being an asshole and overreacting and being mean. Even if they aren't friends with Nosy Nelly, they're also likely to identify with her behaviour because after all, at one point they asked you about your life outside work or invited you places. Maybe they see her as more eager than they were, but it's easier for them to identify with her than you   \n\nAnd while don't want your personal life to impact your professional life, you also don't want Nosy Nelly to impact your professional life either.   \n\nAppearances matter. When people observe you interacting it needs to be obvious to them without any outside context that she is the one who is behaving very inappropriately and that you are not.   \n\nThere are four key things you want to do in your interactions with her.\n\n**1. Politely remind her that as you have previously explained, you are a private person and prefer to keep your professional and personal life separate**\n\nThis explicitly establishes your boundaries to any witnesses and makes them aware that Nosy Nelly already knew them. It should also clue them in that her behavior is more extreme than they realized given that you have never had to pull any of them aside and explicitly explain your boundaries.\n\n**2. Hold firm on your boundaries and don't explain them**  \n\nThis keeps her from trying to test and see exactly where the line is, and it keeps her from claiming to be confused. The line is everything not work related   \n\nIf she says \"I'm just asking about your weekend, what's the harm\" tell her \"I don't have to justify my boundaries to you and expressing them once should be enough\"    \n\n**3. Describe her behaviour and yours in specific and accurate terms. Don't let her define terms **  \n\nShe's not \"just asking\", if she was just asking she'd accept that the answer is \"no\"  \n\nShe's not just being friendly, the friendly thing to do would be to respect your boundaries   \n\nYou're not being rude, you're just reminding her of your boundaries. Boundaries which she is knowingly violating\n\nIf she repeatedly asks about a specific thing, she's not just asking, she's interrogating\n\n**4. Explicitly note her behaviour as aberrant within the office. Remind everyone watching that they all respect your boundaries and that she is the only one who doesnt**\n\nYou stick out from your colleagues with your strict privacy policy, so they're primed to empathise with her. Because previously they tried to initiate such conversations with you or invite you places and you declined. So you don't want them seeing her behaviour as reflective of their own, and empathising with her, excusing her, etc\n\nWhen you explicitly note that everyone else respects your boundaries and that she is the only one who doesn't, this creates a mental separation between the rest of the office and her.\n\nThat way when they see her harassing you, they don't associate it with their own benign behavior\n\n-----------\n\nImagine the interaction at the office had gone this way instead:\n\n**Nosy Nelly:** Fo you have weekend plans?   \n\n**You:** Yes   \n\n**Nosy Nelly:** Oh that's great, with whom?      \n\n**You:** As I've previously explained, I am a private person and prefer to keep my personal and professional life separate. That includes who I spend my time with outside of work    \n\n**Nosy Nelly:** Fine, well then, what are you doing this weekend? Surely *that's* not classified      \n\n**You:** Again, what I do on my own time outside of the office is my private life. I don't really understand what the issue is, everyone else in the office has been very respectful of my boundaries and I really appreciate their professionality      \n\n**Nosy Nelly:** Jeez, I'm not being unprofessional, I was *just* trying to be friendly   \n\n**You:** The friendly thing to do would be to respect my boundaries, not interrogate me about my weekend plans. Everyone else in the office has been very friendly to me. And they've never demanded to know my weekend plans, they just tell me they hope I have a nice weekend   \n\n**Nosy Nelly:** I'm not interrogating you! It was just a harmless question   \n\n**You:** I answered your question and you weren't satisfied with my answer and continued to demand that I tell you personal information. Please just go back to your desk and let me return to my work   \n\n----------   \n\nAs others have noted you absolutely can go to HR over this, and you can go to your boss. how well that will work out depends entirely on how good your boss is and how good the HR department is. I would definitely start with a paper trail - an email to her reminding her that you have been very explicit about your boundaries and find it incredibly inappropriate that she ignores them and interrupts your work to ask you personal questions\n\nBut even with a fantastic boss and HR on your side, this isn't something she'll immediately get fired for unless she publicly loses her shit over it. Which means that she will likely continue to press the issue and it also means that he is likely to bad-mouth you to your coworkers. \n\nAnd if she's smart, she'll try and go for subtle approaches like she did today. And so it becomes your job to make it clear to everyone else that what she is doing is not harmless and friendly but inappropriate. And it becomes your job to be impeccably professional and polite.\n\nYou're NTA, but in this situation you do have to put work in to make it clear to everyone else that you are not the asshole and that she is.\n\nOtherwise she can cause way bigger headaches for you at work", "Your other colleague who\u2019s chastising you has it backwards: Not responding to someone who\u2019s intentionally violating your boundaries is not treating them poorly, it\u2019s treating them *appropriately*.

The most helpful tool I ever learned was the art of grey rocking - be vague, be boring, and immediately change the subject. Nothing interesting here, move along.

It\u2019s reasonable to keep your private life private while you sniff a place\u2019s culture out, and if it\u2019s sucky here too, then maybe stay private and consider this a temporary stopping place. But once you find a place where the culture is good and you want to stay, let your walls down a little and let people in. You have to spend 40 hours a week with them whether you like it or not: if you can find some that you like, it can make your work life much more enjoyable. \n\nHuman connection is what life is all about.
