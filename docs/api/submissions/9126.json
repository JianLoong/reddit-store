Even more so because of my first corporate job, where I was the last to be given time off during holidays or summer, because I was a single woman without children.\n\nWhen I started at my current job, I made the decision that I was not going to get to know anyone. Colleagues will stay just that, colleagues. So I arrive at my desk at 08:45, I'm out the door at 5, I take my lunch break outside the office, don't take my breaks with the other, refuse all invites to things outside work ..\n\nMy new colleagues got the hint when I just said \"no thank you\" when they would invite me, when I opted out of the secret sant even though it was obvious that I celebrated, and when instead of going to a colleague's wedding, I RSVPd no, then sent a gift. They leave me alone, I leave them alone, but we are friendly and am happy to lend a hand when needed.\n\nThen this woman started with us almost 3 months ago. She is very outgoing and social, made friends with the whole office within the first week, and seems to take it as a personal challenge that I do not talk about my personal life.\n\nAt first, I was direct but polite, I told her \"hey colleague, I appreciate that you want to get to know me, but I am an extremely private person, and do not like to mix my professional and personal life together.\" After taking her aside away from others.\n\nWell, instead of backing off, she doubled her efforts. And it's not in a creepy way, or a way that would allow me to go to HR, but I do not like it.\n\nFinally fed up with her, instead of trying to redirect the conversation, or changing the subject, I just stare at her -dead in the eye- without saying anything. \n\nYesterday she came by my desk, and asked if I had plans this weekend, I said yes I do, but didn't elaborate. Then she asked me what my plans were, and if I had someone special that I was going to spend my time with. So I just started her dead in the eye and said nothing for minutes. At first she was annoyed, then she started rambling, then she turned red and left in a hurry.\n\nAnother colleague sitting close by gave me this disappointed look and told me that they understood I was a private person, but that that was no way to treat someone who was genuinely friendly, someone who was trying to include me in the social life of the office.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675532538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tmag5/aita_for_the_way_i_respond_to_my_new_coworkers/", "score": 1516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You volunteer every weekend.  \n\nThat said, work friends can be real friends and you should consider letting people who are genuinely kind in.\n\nEta no I don't really mean say you have a dying child.  I mean it is kinder to say something that is untrue than to stare at someone and refuse to answer them.   It is rude to ignore them.  It is better to just rinse and repeat I don't want to talk about my personal life.

Reporting any of this to HR is just as likely to get you in trouble and will alienate all of your other co-workers who are not your friends but are hers. Some of them may even lie or exaggerate to protect her. And they don't even have to do that. You have already been berated for treating her badly. To an outsider, her questions sound completely normal. Your stare sounds like someone creating a hostile work environment. For her. \n\nYou are very lucky that she's not a vindictive person because you have handed her your \\*ss on a silver platter by treating her this way in front of witnesses that like her and are neutral about you. No one is going to care that you both walked away from that conversation upset. She was being \"socially normal\". You were being \"mean\".\n\nI want to repeat. I am on your side. She \\_should\\_ take a hint and back the f off. But society rewards extroverts and you are not going to win this. Enjoy having the backing of Reddit, mine included, but understand that not one of us face the consequences of your actions. You do.\n\nMy advise if you wish to continue to disengage from your work colleagues: document everything with date/time and incident and then learn to talk with her in as boring a manner as possible. In other words, don't give her stuff that leads to a follow up question. Her: \"Got anything special planned this weekend?\" You: \"Not really.\" Her: \"My plans are blah, blah, blah.\" You: \"Well I hope you have a lovely weekend.\" Or maybe Her: \"Surely you're doing something.\" You: \"Nope! Just a quiet weekend.\" You don't owe her even the slightest detail of your plans, even that they are good ones you're excited for.\n\nFinally, it sounds like you're not getting close to your colleagues so you won't be put last on the list for breaks and first on the list for covering for others (plus the money \\*sigh\\*). That's a sign your other workplace was f-ed up. Pay attention to your current workplace and see if they are behaving the same. You may not need to be so vigilant about hiding your personal details. And if they are just as bad, you might want to find another job any way. As the \"least liked\" person in the office, you're going to get the short end of the stick anyway.

Your \"friendly\" colleague is clearly harassing you, and I'd like you to get to HR before she does.  Document, document, document.  Then let HR know that his has been going on for X weeks/months/whatever but you thought that by indicating what your boundaries were, colleague would back off with the inappropriate prying personal questions.  This hasn't worked, and she is constantly harassing your for personal information, particularly about your romantic/sex life (the someone special questions) making you uncomfortable,  You have simply been declining to reply to end the interrogation, but you just want to make them aware.  \n\nMeanwhile, so much admiration for moving forward in your life after extricating yourself from some very difficult situations.
