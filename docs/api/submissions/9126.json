Even more so because of my first corporate job, where I was the last to be given time off during holidays or summer, because I was a single woman without children.\n\nWhen I started at my current job, I made the decision that I was not going to get to know anyone. Colleagues will stay just that, colleagues.

They leave me alone, I leave them alone, but we are friendly and am happy to lend a hand when needed.\n\nThen this woman started with us almost 3 months ago. She is very outgoing and social, made friends with the whole office within the first week, and seems to take it as a personal challenge that I do not talk about my personal life.\n\nAt first, I was direct but polite, I told her \"hey colleague, I appreciate that you want to get to know me, but I am an extremely private person, and do not like to mix my professional and personal life together.\" After taking her aside away from others.\n\nWell, instead of backing off, she doubled her efforts. And it's not in a creepy way, or a way that would allow me to go to HR, but I do not like it.\n\nFinally fed up with her, instead of trying to redirect the conversation, or changing the subject, I just stare at her -dead in the eye- without saying anything. \n\nYesterday she came by my desk, and asked if I had plans this weekend, I said yes I do, but didn't elaborate. Then she asked me what my plans were, and if I had someone special that I was going to spend my time with. So I just started her dead in the eye and said nothing for minutes. At first she was annoyed, then she started rambling, then she turned red and left in a hurry.\n\nAnother colleague sitting close by gave me this disappointed look and told me that they understood I was a private person, but that that was no way to treat someone who was genuinely friendly, someone who was trying to include me in the social life of the office.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675532538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tmag5/aita_for_the_way_i_respond_to_my_new_coworkers/", "score": 657, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You volunteer every weekend.  \n\nThat said, work friends can be real friends and you should consider letting people who are genuinely kind in.\n\nEta no I don't really mean say you have a dying child.  I mean it is kinder to say something that is untrue than to stare at someone and refuse to answer them.   It is rude to ignore them.  It is better to just rinse and repeat I don't want to talk about my personal life.
