Even more so because of my first corporate job, where I was the last to be given time off during holidays or summer, because I was a single woman without children.\n\nWhen I started at my current job, I made the decision that I was not going to get to know anyone.

And it's not in a creepy way, or a way that would allow me to go to HR, but I do not like it.\n\nFinally fed up with her, instead of trying to redirect the conversation, or changing the subject, I just stare at her -dead in the eye- without saying anything. \n\nYesterday she came by my desk, and asked if I had plans this weekend, I said yes I do, but didn't elaborate. Then she asked me what my plans were, and if I had someone special that I was going to spend my time with. So I just started her dead in the eye and said nothing for minutes. At first she was annoyed, then she started rambling, then she turned red and left in a hurry.\n\nAnother colleague sitting close by gave me this disappointed look and told me that they understood I was a private person, but that that was no way to treat someone who was genuinely friendly, someone who was trying to include me in the social life of the office.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675532538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tmag5/aita_for_the_way_i_respond_to_my_new_coworkers/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are in a witness protection plan and can't talk to people.  You have a dying child at home.  You have a second job and don't have time.  You volunteer every weekend.  \n\nThat said, work friends can be real friends and you should consider letting people who are genuinely kind in.\n\nEta no I don't really mean say you have a dying child.  I mean it is kinder to say something that is untrue than to stare at someone and refuse to answer them.   It is rude to ignore them.  It is better to just rinse and repeat I don't want to talk about my personal life.
