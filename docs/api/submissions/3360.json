My wife said that was no excuse as my mom would have known. I said I wasn't sure if she would. She didn't spend that long in the US and she hated it. She hardly interacted with anyone when she did live here and moved the moment her divorce was final. I'm really not sure how much she picked up on American customs when she didnt interact.\n\nMy wife asked me to kick my stepsister out and I said I didnt feel comfortable as they had had such a long flight and spent so much time and money. I assured her that everyone would know who the bride was, and I really don't think my mom or stepsister knew. \n\nAs the wedding went on I could see it was really effecting her ability to enjoy, and her friends kept bringing it up.

Not likely but possible. It take 2 minutes for someone (other than you) to pull them aside and tell them. I honestly will never understand how women get so bent out of shape about what people are wearing to their wedding. I was focused on my husband...not what people were wearing. The real AH are those who kept bringing it up to the bride instead of distracting her away from your family...Kinda the AH", "If the country your mum and her step daughter are coming from is the one I\u2019m thinking, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised they are not aware to not dress in white as they are very little exposed to western customs.

I may have made an off hand comment to either you or one of my friends then let it go. If it was clearly done on purpose I would have asked you to speak to the family member in the week following the wedding. But could have very likely been the culture difference, in which case I would completely let it go.\n\nCan I ask if there is any personal grudge between your wife and the stepdaughter before this? Other than the argument about not attending the wedding.", "YTA. The problem was not that you gave them the benefit of the doubt. The problem is that you're so conflict-avoidant with your mother that you wouldn't address something that was an obvious problem for your wife on her wedding day. Presumably you want this to be your wife's *only* wedding day, so it would have been appropriate to help problem-solve this issue.\n\nWhy couldn't you (or someone you sent over to speak with them) have pulled your mom and SS aside to mention that wearing white to a wedding is not done, and ask if they could imagine any solution. Your SS may have had another dress packed, or a wrap to cover the dress, or some other solution. But you don't know, because you waited until things were at a boiling point and then tossed them out.\n\nI'm left wondering why your SS was even there, since you'd never met her before.", ">My wife asked me to kick my stepsister out and I said I didnt feel comfortable\n\n> I finally asked mutual family to ask them to leave, but my wife feels it was too little too late and that I didn't defend her.\n\n\nFor these reasons, YTA. Your wife is right. You didnt defend her. You didnt feel comfortable confronting a direct insult to your wife, at her specific request, at your wedding.\n\nYou blew it. You weren't giving them the \"benefit of the doubt\" - you were acting like a coward to avoid the confrontation. Then, you made your friend do it for you instead of ponying up.", "YTA \nYour wife was right! \nIt is general knowledge that no one wears white except the bride! \nWho comes to a wedding in a SPARKLING WHITE dress??", "YTA because you didn't bother finding a solution.\n\nKicking them out is rude, but this wasn't needed. What you had to do was *talk*. Go to them and explain that in your country only the bride wears white at the wedding (surely they felt how people were looking weird at them too, so they must have picked up something was wrong). \n\nAll they had to do was change dresses. You say the stepsister packed for 2 weeks!! Surely she had some backup dress packed! \n\nYour failure to act made everyone miserable: your wife and your mom & stepsister. If they really didn't know (as you assumed), just think how embarrassed they felt when they found out!!!", "Could not the bridesmaids have found a coloured sweater or scarf or something, and discreetly asked them to put it on, so as not to outshine the bride's white?\n\nCould you have suggested this yourself?  Yes.  But you didn't, even though you could see your wife was upset.  It's a small thing, but it's a thing.  This is the first day of the rest of your marriage, and you are starting it by not seeking to remedy conflict between your wife and your mother, but are avoiding upsetting Mummy.  You could have both given her the benefit of the doubt, AND found a solution, but you didn't make an effort.  YTA", "So first, I think it does depend on the country that your mother/stepdaughter live in and how long they have lived there. \n\nI'd say that it is pretty common knowledge that you don't wear white to a US/western European wedding (yes, I know there are likely exceptions and Europe is big), and if/when I have traveled to countries with different customs, I always ask and look them up. \n\nIf the 21 year old stepdaughter has any social media or a Netflix account, thus consuming 1% of American culture, she knew what she was doing. I've never been to a Chinese or Indian wedding, but just from living my life I thing that white isn't the bride color and I think red is? And that question mark is why I would do a google search or ask the bride and groom about customs before going to the wedding. \n\nYTA, you didn't bother to talk to your mom about a US wedding and the customs, and you didn't have a single helpful conversation to diffuse the situation at any point. I don't think you should have necessarily kicked your stepsister out, but your failure to engage at all (go change, put a shawl on, what were you thinking, etc.) is what makes you the AH.", "ESH.  I'm suprised that with all the planning your wife did, she didn't give your mom and stepdaughter the expectations.  As the mother of the groom, it seems she would have gotten the lowdown on the wedding colors and what the bridesmaids were wearing and even suggestions on what the family of the groom could ensemble in.\n\nI personally feel that this was blown into drama by your wife and her friends.  They all knew who the bride was.  Yes, it's a disrespectful move in their opinion, but can be explained away with culture, and brushing it off and having a good night.  Your wife could have done a lot to help their visit go without a hitch, but she was too worried about herself and being the victim.  I bet your mom will never come visit again. Lol", "NTA. I\u2019m gonna take a wild guess and assume your mom and stepsister are Indian. If that\u2019s the case then it could\u2019ve been a genuine mistake, because unlike US culture, Indians brides don\u2019t care about what colour their guests wear and it\u2019s also very normal for Indian guest to wear very sparkly, intricate outfits. \n\nUnless you explicitly told them BEFORE the wedding to not wear white, they are not at fault. And your wife needs to understand that all cultures do not follow the same rules, and it is unfair to expect others to know western culture. I could bet anything that your wife doesn\u2019t know everything about your mom\u2019s culture and what is considered a faux pas in that culture. \n\nBut you\u2019re the main AH, because you\u2019re exposed to both cultures, and instead of talking to your mother and stepsister, like the adult you are, you chose to ask them to leave. Even though it\u2019s likely, with plane tickets and everything else, they sacrificed the most to come to your wedding. \n\nYou and your wife owe your mom and stepsister an apology.\n\nEdit: thank you for the award lovely stranger.", "Sorry man but YTA.\n\nYou're totally correct that the whole world isn't aware of western customs, and you seem to know that there would be a good chance your mom and stepsister wouldn't know about it - *especially* since your mom doesn't like the USA.\n\nYou should have told them the basics before they arrived.  You having an awkward relationship with your mom is irrelevant. This is totally on you. Mom and stepsister aren't the AHs for not knowing the customs, and your wife isn't an AH for being offended by the white dresses. You are the AH for not communicating western wedding customs ahead of time.", "ESH. I cannot believe everyone chose drama and not talking over \u201chey, does anyone have a scarf or a cardigan we could ask the stepsis to put on so Bride doesn\u2019t feel upstaged?\u201d Which, from me is a major \ud83d\ude44 because I\u2019ve also been married for over 20 years and am so far past how important the wedding is that I can\u2019t even see it on Google maps.", "NTA. Wow sounds like your wife and her friends spent more time gossiping than enjoying the wedding. Of course it\u2019s totally annoying that they wore white, but she\u2019s taking it wayyyy too far.", "YTA.\n\nYour job, as the family member who was getting married, was to *make sure your mother and sister knew not to wear white*.", "YTA. You should have stuck up for your wife.", "YTA - This is not something you should have tolerated. It's rude for any woman other than the bride to wear white. Your mom and stepsister knew what exactly they were doing, and you let them ruin the wedding for your wife by not standing up to them. The duration of their flight to get to your wedding is irrelevant, as well as the amount of money, when they took that time and spent that money to disrespect your wife. Even when you finally had enough, you didn't even do it yourself. Lastly, even if they somehow genuinely didn't know that they weren't supposed to wear white at the wedding, it's on you to tell them.", "YTA. If this culture is what I think it is (Indian or Asian) they do wear red instead, however white is a colour for death/mourning. So at the end of the day it\u2019s still not a colour you technically should  wear to a wedding. Now if they are not from those cultures, it\u2019s still on you to stand with your wife and be decisive and have a conversation with your mom and step sister.

She didn\u2019t need that stress.\n\nYou need to shiny your spine and grow a pair and apologise to your wife.", "ESH except OP.  You were rational and understood that given the cultural differences, money and time spent, even though it was shitty it shouldn\u2019t have warranted confrontation.  Wife shouldve let go, friends should mind their own fucking business.  Wife could\u2019ve said something herself if it was that big a deal", "YTA\n\nThe only culture I can think that wears red as the bride is Asian.

None of this is on you. You did not create the problem, your wife\u2019s friends did. There is no pleasant way to ask anyone to leave a wedding.

If I (an American) showed up to an Indian wedding in red, I\u2019d be lambasted for being culturally insensitive - and rightfully so. I know America isn\u2019t known for its high brow customs but it is still rude to show up to a stranger\u2019s wedding (essentially uninvited) in a sparkly white dress when that is a known cultural faux pas. The fact that you\u2019ll excuse their laziness as ignorance over the fact that they DID insult the bride (intentional or not) says a lot about how you view your wife and this once in a lifetime event.\n\nYTA and so is your mom and stepsister.", "NTA. Honestly, assuming that they knew about the tradition and did that on purpose is quite dramatic.

Instead, she chose to believe the worst and to reduce the enjoyment of her own wedding. That\u2019s on her (and her friends).\n\nBrides need to chill out.

Your the groom and it\u2019s your family member causing a scene. But you didn\u2019t even handle it making you the coward and AH", "They use white for funerals instead.", "And yet when I go to a country I look up local customs, especially at an event, to ensure we aren't doing a faux pax. Takes 5 second to look up etiquette of US weddings to see you don't wear white.", "I'm sure that in other countries you're not supposed to out dress the bridge regardless of color. Showing up in a super sparkly formal gown is bad taste regardless of color. The fact that she chose white just tattles that it was deliberate.", "Yes ofc, but if you are 21 years old and still don't know something so simple, than there is a problem.", "To be fair in many countries where brides don't wear white no one does. Like in Asian and African weddings where brides wear red but no one wears white because it signifies death.", "Look best case scenario this was ignorance borne of sheer laziness. However, that isn\u2019t really a great excuse in my opinion. Who goes to a wedding in another country and doesn\u2019t look up cultural customs to be respectful? If an American did the equivalent at an Indian wedding (wearing red) they\u2019d be rightfully in hot water. Is it really okay for other cultures to do this and claim ignorance when a simple google search on etiquette could have solved the problem? I\u2019m not saying this was necessarily intentional but I am saying it was easily avoided by being a thoughtful and respectful guest (esp since this woman doesn\u2019t even KNOW YOUR WIFE AND WASNT TECHNICALLY INVITED).", "Like go buy one - literally go to Walmart or something and buy a new dress. The fact you went through the ceremony with your mom and stepsister dressed like that when you knew your wife was upset makes you the asshole.", "I've attended two weddings in Nepal. The bride wore red and so did almost all of the other women attending. I am not familiar with Pakistan, and there are likely variations across both countries, but is not inconceivable that they were translating their culture into American culture (wear white instead of red) and misfired part way (only bride instead of everyone). In the end it is a shame that this escalated so far, quick conversation before or during could have easily sorted it out. I'm going with mild EAH on everyone for not speaking/googling to prevent the whole situation from escalating.", "Pakistan is not India.  I know some girls who were forbidden to watch Full House growing up as is was inappropriate.  It is completely possible, likely even,  that step daughter had no idea because she wasn't allowed to watch western movies/ shows. Especially if mom hates America.", "Pakistanis normally use wear white for death and mourning. Still disrespectful.", "This makes it worst to me because I went to college with people from the Middle East and India. They always joked about watching Bridezilla or American wedding movies. She knew unless she grew up as some shut in but then why would her family let her come here so\u2026", "\"I'm too much of a coward to talk to my own mom\" is a bold choice of excuse. \n\nYTA", "Maybe it\u2019s different sub-cultures, because I\u2019m Indian and Hindu and although we do wear white to funerals, where I\u2019m from it is not frowned upon to wear white Indian wear at weddings.", "[It seems that the royal family is fine with people other than the bride wearing white to a wedding.](https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/20221017154377/why-royal-bridesmaids-wear-white/)", "How do you know? You didn\u2019t ask anyone", "that is not the point and even this reaction makes YTA", "She's still on your side of the guestlist. If you don't know her enough to communicate with her about this sort of thing, you probably shouldn't have invited her.", "I\u2019d like to double down on my assessment of your character. Your poor wife.", "I mean, it entirely has to do with cultural differences and is a benefit of the doubt thing.  If they were Americans they absolutely should\u2019ve been turned away.", "Listen... let\u2019s say her step-daughter is ridiculously petty & has horrible manners. What exactly would be her motivation for trying to \u201coutshine\u201d your wife who she has never met?!? Was she disruptive in anyway? Did she wear colored jewelry? Was it a long dress/short dress? There are a million ways this was not that big of a deal.\n\nETA I have planned hundreds of weddings & this happens way more than people think. Some idiot shows up in white. They are not asked to leave. They are politely asked not to stand anywhere near the bridal party or the bride during the event. No wedding that I have planned has ever been interrupted because someone wore something inappropriate... no matter the color. No one can outshine the bride on her wedding day. This was a gossip fest created by the bride\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d.", "But you didn't ask her to go. You took a long time to do it, to the point your own wife didn't see the point anymore. You did not take action fast enough or talked to your mother about it.", "Or maybe because they are foreigners they don\u2019t know Western culture. It\u2019s not unheard of.", "And how can you know that definitely? You don't know her. I don't know her, and I don't know if she's even been out of her country before. Do you just assume America is so important that everyone knows our rules?", "> That's why I asked if your wife is respectful of your families culture?\n\nShe's never interacted with them and knows nothing about it but would never be disrespectful", "Where does it say Mom & step-daughter were causing a scene? Wearing white to a wedding doesn\u2019t push a button that immediately creates chaos .... it\u2019s at best a faux pas ... especially when these 2 people had no prior relationship with the bride & therefore no reason to try to blow up her wedding. Sounds like the only people causing a scene were bride\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d. Sorry but IMO if the bride absolutely can\u2019t stand to see another woman dressed in white at her wedding she\u2019s not mature enough to get married.", "In India no one cares about outdressing the bride. People often wear their own wedding outfits to other people's weddings.   No one cares,  as is always obvious who the bride is,  she's the one one dripping with jewelry, wearing a floral garland and usually her outfit is draped over her hair.", "Not everyone is from America.", "I don't think that's really true anymore though. Alot of people in India for example wear white to weddings, even a lot of brides wear white and beige nowadays even though white isn't thought to be the most auspicious colour", "I was actually wondering about how easy it would be to figure this out, so I googled \"American wedding customs\", and while a lot of articles point out that brides usually wear white, none of the ones I read note that nobody else is supposed to wear white.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not even sure if I had done this kind of research in that position. I'd just assume that if there were any customs I had to follow, they'd be pointed out to me, since it's borderline impossible to figure out what exactly the rules are for a specific wedding - not every wedding in America has the exact same rules, customs and tastes are different across States and across individual people. Friends of the bride and groom probably know what they want and expect, but I think it's fair to say that almost everybody else will just assume that the invitation will tell them what to wear.", "You think you can buy a black tie dress at Walmart?", "Not sure what cowardice has to do with it. I just don't have anything to say to her. She knew the wedding colors (and wore one) but we didn't care too much about what she wore", "I think that someone who lives a lifestyle where she can fly in for a wedding in a sparkly dress has probably watched a movie or TV show where a wedding happens, Disney Princess movies even, Hindhi dramas even have the trope of the bride and MIL fighting over white vs red. She would have certainly seen that in many cultures white is the wedding colour. People too poor to have seen TV don't get visa to fly in for a wedding. \n\nOr you can assume she was just completely ignorant and decided to wear funeral attire to your wedding. \n\nEither way she's an AH and YTA", "It's not an American rule. I'm French and you don't wear white to a wedding. It's common knowledge.", "I'm not American and it's absolutely not acceptable here either, you could have respectfully told your stepsister the situation and given her the chance to change clothing or leave, but you made your wife miserable on her wedding day and showed that her feelings didn't matter.", "If you don\u2019t know her why was she at your wedding? \n\nThe bride wearing white isn\u2019t only a USA custom, and many cultures know not to wear white to a wedding for a variety of reasons. Maybe they wore it without knowing better, regardless of what they meant YTA. Without more context we can\u2019t say if they\u2019re also assholes but definitely you were. \n\nYour wife asked for you to take action on something making her uncomfortable on her wedding day and you didn\u2019t until it was too late.", "Good. Just checking. Maybe she doesn't understand just how different weddings in other countries can be. I hope this didn't take up too much of the wedding. Have you explained the upset to your mum/the stepdaughter? Would maybe be helpful to get to the bottom of it.", "THIS. Yup. I'm also from South Asia and this is a very western thing to know not to wear white...", "But it is not only an American custom.", "Oh, you can buy the kind of dress someone who thought it was okay to wear white to a wedding deserves to wear at Walmart", "Then go to Macy's and buy an off the rack dress.  They were not dressed appropriately and nobody seems to know why.  If I unknowingly competed a social and cultural mistake, I would want to know and rectify the situation immediately.  Even if it was exactly perfect.", "So, your mother and her guest flew hours to come to your wedding and...no one thought to have a meet and greet before hand?  \n\nI'm just blown away that you'd let your own mother come thousands of miles then not include her in the events preceeding the main event.   This is a time where you get dressed together, do your hair & makeup together.  Make them feel included.\n\nI'm not saying you and your wife need to be best buddies with your mom and ss, but you don't need to be besties to offer a considerate invitation to be \"a part\" of the big day.  A quick, \"Im so glad to meet you! How are your accommodations? Anything you need to get at the store that you forgot to pack? Let's grab lunch together. Do you want to get ready with us? Let us see your dresses!!!!\" Could have prevented this, preemptively while at the same time started to build a relationship.  \"OH. You're wearing all white?  Can we find you a colorful wrap?  In American culture it's considered bad luck to wear the same color as the bride!\"", "Since you describe your wife as a perfectionist and wedding colors information was shared with your mom, did it occur to you to point out to your mother that wearing 'x' color (such as white) would not be appropriate for the wedding?", "You do get the bride wears white in France right, so that one doesn't really count?", "Well it appears that at least in the UK it appears to be ok (at least for some) - ie British royal weddings.", "But it's not a custom everywhere.  Do you know everything there is to know about other people's customs? No highly doubtful", "My wife didn't want to include them in hair and makeup. I did pick them up at the airport but no one really talked.", "I just didn't even think of it. Especially because my mom said she was going to wear green. I didn't even think about her stepdaughter as I've never met her", "Well, my ESH judgement still stands.  You shouldn't have invited her if you were all going to be assholes to her.  I'd of worn a white sparkly dress too just to give you the middle finger after welcoming me to your wedding festivities that way. Lol", "Did you mention not wearing white to your mom? My question was not able t the stepdaughter.", "No because I knew what she was wearing"]}
