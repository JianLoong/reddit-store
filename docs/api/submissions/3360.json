My wife said that was no excuse as my mom would have known. I said I wasn't sure if she would. She didn't spend that long in the US and she hated it. She hardly interacted with anyone when she did live here and moved the moment her divorce was final. I'm really not sure how much she picked up on American customs when she didnt interact.\n\nMy wife asked me to kick my stepsister out and I said I didnt feel comfortable as they had had such a long flight and spent so much time and money. I assured her that everyone would know who the bride was, and I really don't think my mom or stepsister knew. \n\nAs the wedding went on I could see it was really effecting her ability to enjoy, and her friends kept bringing it up.

It is possible that they did not know. Not likely but possible. It take 2 minutes for someone (other than you) to pull them aside and tell them.

The real AH are those who kept bringing it up to the bride instead of distracting her away from your family...Kinda the AH", "If the country your mum and her step daughter are coming from is the one I\u2019m thinking, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised they are not aware to not dress in white as they are very little exposed to western customs.

I may have made an off hand comment to either you or one of my friends then let it go. If it was clearly done on purpose I would have asked you to speak to the family member in the week following the wedding. But could have very likely been the culture difference, in which case I would completely let it go.\n\nCan I ask if there is any personal grudge between your wife and the stepdaughter before this? Other than the argument about not attending the wedding.", "YTA. The problem was not that you gave them the benefit of the doubt. The problem is that you're so conflict-avoidant with your mother that you wouldn't address something that was an obvious problem for your wife on your wedding day. Presumably you want this to be your wife's *only* wedding day, so it would have been appropriate to help problem-solve this issue.\n\nWhy couldn't you (or someone you sent over to speak with them) have pulled your mom and SS aside to mention that wearing white to a wedding is not done, and ask if they could imagine any solution. Your SS may have had another dress packed, or a wrap to cover the dress, or some other solution. But you don't know, because you waited until things were at a boiling point and then tossed them out.\n\nI'm left wondering why your SS was even there, since you'd never met her before.", ">My wife asked me to kick my stepsister out and I said I didnt feel comfortable\n\n> I finally asked mutual family to ask them to leave, but my wife feels it was too little too late and that I didn't defend her.\n\n\nFor these reasons, YTA. Your wife is right. You didnt defend her. You didnt feel comfortable confronting a direct insult to your wife, at her specific request, at your wedding.\n\nYou blew it. You weren't giving them the \"benefit of the doubt\" - you were acting like a coward to avoid the confrontation. Then, you made your friend do it for you instead of ponying up.", "YTA \nYour wife was right! \nIt is general knowledge that no one wears white except the bride! \nWho comes to a wedding in a SPARKLING WHITE dress??", "YTA because you didn't bother finding a solution.\n\nKicking them out is rude, but this wasn't needed. What you had to do was *talk*. Go to them and explain that in your country only the bride wears white at the wedding (surely they felt how people were looking weird at them too, so they must have picked up something was wrong). \n\nAll they had to do was change dresses. You say the stepsister packed for 2 weeks!! Surely she had some backup dress packed! \n\nYour failure to act made everyone miserable: your wife and your mom & stepsister.

Yes.  But you didn't, even though you could see your wife was upset.  It's a small thing, but it's a thing.  This is the first day of the rest of your marriage, and you are starting it by not seeking to remedy conflict between your wife and your mother, but are avoiding upsetting Mummy.  You could have both given her the benefit of the doubt, AND found a solution, but you didn't make an effort.  YTA", "So first, I think it does depend on the country that your mother/stepdaughter live in and how long they have lived there. \n\nI'd say that it is pretty common knowledge that you don't wear white to a US/western European wedding (yes, I know there are likely exceptions and Europe is big), and if/when I have traveled to countries with different customs, I always ask and look them up. \n\nIf the 21 year old stepdaughter has any social media or a Netflix account, thus consuming 1% of American culture, she knew what she was doing. I've never been to a Chinese or Indian wedding, but just from living my life I thing that white isn't the bride color and I think red is? And that question mark is why I would do a google search or ask the bride and groom about customs before going to the wedding. \n\nYTA, you didn't bother to talk to your mom about a US wedding and the customs, and you didn't have a single helpful conversation to diffuse the situation at any point. I don't think you should have necessarily kicked your stepsister out, but your failure to engage at all (go change, put a shawl on, what were you thinking, etc.) is what makes you the AH.", "ESH.  I'm suprised that with all the planning your wife did, she didn't give your mom and stepdaughter the expectations.  As the mother of the groom, it seems she would have gotten the lowdown on the wedding colors and what the bridesmaids were wearing and even suggestions on what the family of the groom could ensemble in.\n\nI personally feel that this was blown into drama by your wife and her friends.  They all knew who the bride was.  Yes, it's a disrespectful move in their opinion, but can be explained away with culture, and brushing it off and having a good night.  Your wife could have done a lot to help their visit go without a hitch, but she was too worried about herself and being the victim.  I bet your mom will never come visit again. Lol", "NTA. I\u2019m gonna take a wild guess and assume your mom and stepsister are Indian. If that\u2019s the case then it could\u2019ve been a genuine mistake, because unlike US culture, Indians brides don\u2019t care about what colour their guests wear and it\u2019s also very normal for Indian guest to wear very sparkly, intricate outfits. \n\nUnless you explicitly told them BEFORE the wedding to not wear white, they are not at fault. And your wife needs to understand that all cultures do not follow the same rules, and it is unfair to expect others to know western culture. I could bet anything that your wife doesn\u2019t know everything about your mom\u2019s culture and what is considered a faux pas in that culture. \n\nBut you\u2019re the main AH, because you\u2019re exposed to both cultures, and instead of talking to your mother and stepsister, like the adult you are, you chose to ask them to leave. Even though it\u2019s likely, with plane tickets and everything else, they sacrificed the most to come to your wedding. \n\nYou and your wife owe your mom and stepsister an apology.\n\nEdit: thank you for the award lovely stranger.", "Sorry man but YTA.\n\nYou're totally correct that the whole world isn't aware of western customs, and you seem to know that there would be a good chance your mom and stepsister wouldn't know about it - *especially* since your mom doesn't like the USA.\n\nYou should have told them the basics before they arrived.  You having an awkward relationship with your mom is irrelevant. This is totally on you. Mom and stepsister aren't the AHs for not knowing the customs, and your wife isn't an AH for being offended by the white dresses. You are the AH for not communicating western wedding customs ahead of time.", "ESH. I cannot believe everyone chose drama and not talking over \u201chey, does anyone have a scarf or a cardigan we could ask the stepsis to put on so Bride doesn\u2019t feel upstaged?\u201d Which, from me is a major \ud83d\ude44 because I\u2019ve also been married for over 20 years and am so far past how important the wedding is that I can\u2019t even see it on Google maps.", "NTA. Wow sounds like your wife and her friends spent more time gossiping than enjoying the wedding. Of course it\u2019s totally annoying that they wore white, but she\u2019s taking it wayyyy too far.", "YTA.\n\nYour job, as the family member who was getting married, was to *make sure your mother and sister knew not to wear white*.", "YTA. You should have stuck up for your wife.", "YTA - This is not something you should have tolerated. It's rude for any woman other than the bride to wear white. Your mom and stepsister knew what exactly they were doing, and you let them ruin the wedding for your wife by not standing up to them. The duration of their flight to get to your wedding is irrelevant, as well as the amount of money, when they took that time and spent that money to disrespect your wife. Even when you finally had enough, you didn't even do it yourself. Lastly, even if they somehow genuinely didn't know that they weren't supposed to wear white at the wedding, it's on you to tell them.", "YTA. If this culture is what I think it is (Indian or Asian) they do wear red instead, however white is a colour for death/mourning. So at the end of the day it\u2019s still not a colour you technically should  wear to a wedding. Now if they are not from those cultures, it\u2019s still on you to stand with your wife and be decisive and have a conversation with your mom and step sister.

You were rational and understood that given the cultural differences, money and time spent, even though it was shitty it shouldn\u2019t have warranted confrontation.

If I (an American) showed up to an Indian wedding in red, I\u2019d be lambasted for being culturally insensitive - and rightfully so. I know America isn\u2019t known for its high brow customs but it is still rude to show up to a stranger\u2019s wedding (essentially uninvited) in a sparkly white dress when that is a known cultural faux pas.

This is usually a smaller number of people who were close to the deceased and/or the chief mourner(s), because their final goodbye is usually the most emotional part of the process for the chief mourner(s), and more intimate than the viewing.  If the person was religious, the coffin might be taken to their place of worship one last time for a funeral service between the funeral home and the cemetery.
