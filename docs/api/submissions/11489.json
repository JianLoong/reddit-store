At home, our fridge is full of all our report cards and various achievements. \n\nMy sister Fer (14F) on the other hand, not so much.  It's quite hard to find anything that has Fer's name on the fridge, not because she's the least favourite or isn't loved by my parents, but because she doesn't have any.\n\nIn hopes of helping my sister with her academics, my mom made me and Max tutor Fer with one of the subjects she was finding difficult. Max does Maths, while I do English (and my dad does science). \n\nI've enjoyed tutoring Fer, but it seems as if the feeling is not mutual. \n\nExample: Last Friday as I was tutoring Fer, she asked if she could \"quickly\" go to the toilet. I said yes. \n\n10 minutes late she had still not returned, when I went to check on her I found her in the living room watching TV. \n\n\nYesterday afternoon Fer came to me and asked if I would please tutor her for her upcoming English test. I agreed but only if she promised to pay attention this time. \n\nFer promised she would and for a while, she stayed true to that, I was helping through something she found extremely challenging and she was working with me until Max came home with McDonald's (our parents are crazy health nuts so fast food is a rarity in our home). \n\nFer looked ready to put everything down just to eat and started claiming that all the studying was making her hungry. \n\nI told Max that we were busy and he should just leave the food in the oven and we'd heat it later. At this Fer started to whine, saying that I was being unfair by not allowing her a break.\n\n Max decided to side with her, even though he knows how much she needs this tutoring and started saying that I was being too strict. \n\nFer beamed at that and was ready to go downstairs to eat. \n\nSomething in me snapped, after all these times of trying to get Fer's attention failed, the one time it was needed she was going to leave it to eat McDonald's. \n\nI told her to not go and she didn't listen, this angered me very much, she was still not listening to me, \n\nI raised my voice ( Max says I yelled) and told her \"Fer, this is the reason why you're behind all your classes! You're in all these extra classes like the piece of shit you are for a reason. Why won't you listen, you idiot\". \n\nShe immediately began crying loud ugly sobs.  \nafter I had \"yelled\" at her while Max gave her hug.   \n\nWhen my parents came home, they were more annoyed that I had called my sister \"an idiot\" than the fact that she would not listen to me when I was repeatedly trying to get her to do some work. \n\nWhen I asked Max why he decided to side with Fer he said that \"there was no point anyway because it was inevitable that she was going to fail\".  \n\nFer won't even look me in the eyes, but she's been all over Max for helping her that afternoon. \n\nFeel like everyone forgets that she's 14, not 4 because she's the youngest.\n\nAITA for wanting my sister to do some work?", "created_utc": 1677970323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ifwod/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_eat/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Calling your sister an idiot is not a way to get her to do what she wants. \n\nAlso neither one of you should be tutoring her. Your parents should be discussing steps with her teachers. Perhaps your sister has a learning disability or some folks are just smart in other areas beside school.", "YTA. I understand that you're frustrated by her attitude during your tutoring but calling her names is completely uncalled for. You should go apologize to her before she decides to resent you. Your brother also sounds pretty shitty though with that \"she's gonna fail anyway\" line, doesn't sound like he has much respect for her", "Holy god long story that could have been short", "YTA. You were unnecessarily harsh and your interaction would be the opposite of motivating. I mean she was going to eat at some point. I can't see why it would make a difference.\n\nInfo-Was it an especially bad time to take a break for some reason?", "YTA. You insulted your *sister* just because she's not book smart? So. Fucking. What? \n\nWant me to point out all the errors you made in this post Mr. So-Great-At-English?", "YTA - You have been told you shouldn\u2019t have treated your little sister like that by your brother, your mother and father and you are still coming to Reddit for what reason? No sibling is going to listen to an older sibling who calls them names and berates them. The fact you don\u2019t know this despite you professing how intelligent you are astounds me. \n\nThe fact is? She might need tutoring but ultimately? It\u2019s not on you to keep her on track with it and it certainly isn\u2019t on you to call her an idiot or tell her that she is the reason she is failing. I found school exceptionally easy as a child, I had the same delusion that anyone struggling just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough when the reality is? People can just struggle with certain concepts. People can have barriers that they find it really hard to get past when it comes to education. YTA 100 times over.", "YTA - Go apologise to your little sister. You're suppose to be her brother, what kind of brother gets annoyed at his sister for wanting to eat and taking a break from studying. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA on so many levels it's astounding.", "YTA.  Maybe she was hungry.  Maybe she just needed a break to then refocus.  Maybe she wasn\u2019t feeling motivated.  Who knows?  You certainly never will, because you\u2019ve made clear that you have no interest in what she\u2019s feeling. The way you responded to her was awful.\n\nI will also throw a bit of TA your parents\u2019 way.  I have kids in the tween to teen age ranges.  Some are stronger academically than others, but all of them have areas where they shine.  Exam papers are not the only thing that should go on the fridge.", "YTA McDonalds is horrible if not eaten fresh you should have let her enjoy the rare treat, do you honestly think that the tutoring getting in the way of her enjoying something that she gets access to so rarely is going to make her engage more in the sessions?", "YTA just for wanting to reheat McDonalds.\nthe abuse makes you a momentous asshole.\nwhy be a dick? youre almost a grown man. \nwhy tf does she need your permission to go to the restroom?\nall the kids in this family need therapy", "YTA, first for trying to stop her from eating, second for treating her as if she's you.\n\nNot everyone is 'brilliant' like you and you're forgetting she's 14.", "YTA. You are a literal child trying to boss another child around. Some may say that 17 is an adult\u2026well you sure didn\u2019t act like that by calling your child sister a piece of shit and an idiot now did you?", "YTA, you didn't just yell, you chose to verbally abuse her, it's no wonder she's upset with you. You definitely need to apologise to her for that.\n\nAlso, I really don't want to assume anything, but I feel like there might be a reason why Fer is having issues with studying, perhaps a different approach / technique is needed for her? If she is struggling because of a possible neurodivergent condition then she might need some additional help, help which you and your family (at this point in time) wouldn't be able to provide for her.", "YTA. Calling her an idiot isn't going to help her.  Also, you and your brother should not be tutoring her. You might do well academically, but that doesn't make you a good tutor for a student who is already struggling. It also might be easier for your sister to listen to a non-relative more seriously than her brothers.", "YTA. You have zero authority over your sister.", "YTA for sure. Perhaps wonder why she finds it so hard to focus, and that if someone is avoiding doing something, it's not because they are lazy or whatever. Maybe Fer just finds it really hard or isn't understanding, or even feels embarrassed when they see all you and your bro's stuff on the fridge and feels like there's no point. It sounds like you aren't considering how SHE learns, in fact it sounds like you have very little understanding and empathy of her. Different students have different needs, and instead of belittling her, you should actually help to encourage her. You and your brother should be ashamed of how you speak to her. If you tell someone they suck, they will suck.\n\nPlus, reheated McDonald's sucks, why you gotta do her like that when it's such a treat in your household?", "YTA. You and your brother sound naturally gifted. Good for you. It also sounds like that's a lot of pressure on your younger sibling. I highly doubt she's any less intelligent than you two, just feels constant weight on her shoulders that's stressing her out. You're almost always in the wrong if you call someone an idiot, especially your younger sister who is trying to learn. Apologize.", "YTA why couldnt you eat and then get back to studying? Or srudy while you eat.\n\nHell i did all my homework/studying during commercial breaks and i made honor roll every semester.", "YTA, pretty big one at that too", "YTA people can\u2019t concentrate when they\u2019re hungry. Giving her a break to eat would have made it easier for her to study", "YTA including your parents.\n\nRewarding kids based on food.They're going to give her an eating disorder. \n\nAlso in the real world 90% kids who are academically inclined or on honor roll have essentially the same jobs as everyone else.", "YTA. You called your 14 year old sister a \"piece of shit\" and an \"idiot\". This isn't about her fucking eating. This is about you being cruel. Clearly, you cannot control your temper and you shouldn't be tutoring her anymore. Get either Max or your Dad to take over English, and apologize to your sister for calling her horrible things.", "You need more than a tutor. Yikes. YTA", "YTA, denying food and then insulting her? Asssssshole.", "Your whole family sucks except your sister. You all are awful to her and treat her as less than because she\u2019s not as academically gifted as you. Sounds like she has a terrible attention span\u2026has she ever been tested? I highly doubt there\u2019s nothing that could be put on the fridge to honor Fer, you all just don\u2019t value her. Shame on all of you, Y-T-A and I hope Fer finds people who actually like her in the future.\n\nETA: changing my vote to ESH excluding Fer.", "YTA, jeez what you said was really hurtful and uncalled for. Also what your brother said at the end was messed up too, the lack of faith he had in her is honestly messed up. She needs an actual tutor, maybe go to the library to help her focus.", "YTA. \n\nThere is more to a person than academic success. Does she have other strengths? Do you even know what they are? You clearly see her as less than because she isn\u2019t academically gifted. \n\nIs she actually failing, or is the just not as good as you and your brother?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to hire an actual tutor for her, as teaching and helping people is a skill, and it sounds like you don\u2019t have the patience for it. \n\nYour parents really can\u2019t find /something/ to be proud of her for to put on the fridge?", "YTA. You want her to pay attention. She is going to do that a lot better with food than with sitting there thinking about and being distracted by the food.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't tutor someone and expect them to have an easy time. Things that come to you don't come easily to her, that's why she needs help. If you don't have the patience to teach her and deal with the fact her studying rhythm is different and her attention span is shorter, **don't**. It's much better than you blowing up like that and diminishing her confidence further. Abd for the record, it seems like you do feel superior to her because of your academic achievements, and it sure came out in your outburst. That's really really hurtful.\n\nI'm sure it's not easy for her to struggle in school when you guys seem to be doing stellar. For all you know she may have a learning disability, or she just needs a different explanation - doesn't matter. The way you spoke to her was a no go, and you owe her a big apology.", "ESH. \nYour parents should not be burdening you and Max with your sister\u2018s problems.\n\nMax should not be negative and say that his sister is going to fail.\n\nBy far, the biggest AH is you. You should probably consider therapy for your anger issues.", "YTA. Jeez, you totally overreacted. Good thing you're not a professional tutor or teacher because you're clearly bad at it. What you said to your sister was verbally abusive. It only would have taken a few minutes to eat the food and then she could get back to work. Screaming and cursing at her won't motivate her.", "Guessing your sister doesn't enjoy tutoring since other people (you) don't seem to make learning enjoyable as it should be. Would suggest not to choose teaching as a career.", "YTA - you shouldn\u2019t be calling her names. Does she have a hard time sitting still and concentrating? You may have to change how you tutor her. I couldn\u2019t sit still studying for long periods of time (No I don\u2019t have ADHD). What worked for me was setting a timer. I would study for 30 minutes and get a 5-10 minute break. By breaking it up in chunks it kept my attention and had me look forward to a small treat if I concentrated for the required time.", "YTA I struggled in school my whole life. Studying on empty stomach never helped me. Fast food doesn\u2019t taste good once it is cold. You couldn\u2019t let her have 20 minute break to eat. Did you try to make studying fun at all? Maybe the she needs to study a different way? People have learning styles. I am visual hands on person. Just telling me to read something doesn\u2019t help and I can never remember it.", "ESH - she's 14 and she's behind for a reason.    If your parents aren't going to step in and make sure the tutoring is 'doable' then she'll be behind.   Is there something wrong with her attention span?      People don't fail that much without something behind it.    Your parents need to put some boundaries in place that penalize her for non-compliance.    Somehow she needs to learn that she's not in school for her social life.  She's there to get an education and skills so she can function in society.    I understand your frustration with her and trying to get her focused, but you need to get your parents on board with her lack of cooperation in tutoring.", "I'm going to go with YTA for shouting at her, especially if she'd been behaving before that, but I feel you. I was always booksmart and older, and my sister took forever to learn how to read. She's smart, but basically parents didn't make school a priority for her. \n Dad was effing lazy, so he appointed me with turoring her (we might have been 7 or 8 and 13ish?), which I didn't mind, but she had zero interest and kept trying to hop off to watch tv or whatever. I pretty much decided I was asked to help her learn how to read, not how to sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes and gave up really quickly.", "Yta for insulting her. If she fails then she fails that's on her.", "ESH. You should have just let her eat. But it sounds like she regularly doesn't take tutoring seriously which is disrespectful of your time. I also think it was risky of your parents to \"make\" you tutor her because I imagine being both a sibling and a teacher can't be easy.", "ESH  \n\n\nThe whole situation sounds awful, and nobody seems healthy, or supportive at all. You and your brother shouldn't have to tutor your sister, and you shouldn't feel obligated to. It's her life, and she needs to learn that her actions have consequences on her own. It's your parents job to parent her, not yours. What you said was mean, and it definitely sounds like you meant it to hurt on purpose. Stop tutoring her, and mind your own business. If she wants to fail, even with people willing to help her, that's on her.", "INFO - has your sister ever been tested for ADHD?\n\nIt could be nothing but the way you describe her behavior sounds *exactly* like my daughter who has it pretty strongly.", "YTA. Regardless of the source, she clearly has low focus. Instead of working with it, you expect her to just sit and power through, as if that's done her any good before. She might have an untreated disorder that makes schoolwork more difficult for her, and you being an AH about it isn't going to magically make her grades improve and the focus problems go away. People that can't focus *do* actually need breaks to refocus. They can't just do it all in one sitting.", "NTA if the parents were paying for the tutor they wouldn't be siding with the sister. They would be telling her to pay attention. Should you have called her an idiot - no. But the fact that you are taking time out of your day to tutor her and she's not paying attention is very frustrating.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not only that, but you should never do it again. You made the decision to tutor her, it\u2019s okay to be frustrated if you feel she\u2019s not paying attention. That\u2019s fine. But you don\u2019t ever get to speak to her like you think she\u2019s less worthy of anything. That\u2019s really bad behavior on your end.", "YTA and it sounds like she might have ADHD", "YTA what is wrong with you", "YTA not everyone gets on well with academic learning,  has she been tested for dyslexia, ADHD, or anything like that? Honestly denying a 14 year old food is not a good way to tutor", "YTA", "YTA. You and your brother sure hate her, huh.", "This has to be fake. YTA", "YTA.  Her saying she has to go to the bathroom and you finding her watching TV is classic task avoidance.  Your parents would be better off collaborating with her teachers and making the effort to find out WHY Fer is actively avoiding classwork rather than relying on their teenagers to tutor and verbally abuse their sister.", "YTA without a doubt.", "honestly i wish i could take your sister away from your family and let her live with me, y'all sound awful and ableist. it sounds like ADHD and trust me as someone with ADHD, yelling does not help. if anything it makes me more upset with myself and more likely to shut down entirely. YTA.", "YTA, again, just a young girl being yelled at and insulted for no reason. If she's having trouble with oay attention and studies have your parent thought to get her tested to ADHD so they can take more APPROPRIATELY action, or did you ever think that maybe she just isn't thr academic type? My brother has ADHD that would cause him to act out and lose focus and get super hyperactive (he had medication temporarily, but I think he's doing better now), my oldest sister is considered the academic in my family because she struggled and focused real hard on her studies WHILE working 2 jobs. The rest of my siblings and parents aren't the academic type. We don't enjoy it, sometimes we don't understand it fully, I'm in uni and it's a freaking struggle because I'm not the type to sit at a desk and write papers and research maths but I'm in a finance degree so I gotta do what I gotta do. What I'm trying to say is take it easy on her because she isn't you. Your methods aren't always the way to study, and maybe that is what she struggles with.", "Um I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA bc I\u2019d be frustrated too if I was putting all this effort into something that was *requested* of me only to not receive the same level of effort. But also, if she wanted to not take her life seriously (bc she\u2019s 14 and that\u2019s typical) then let her.", "YTA - you are emotionally abusing your sister. You may be book smart but you have zero emotional intelligence.", "Please do it", "I told my sibling \u201cFuck you kid - you\u2019re garbage at school! And you can\u2019t eat either!\u201d\n\nAITA?\n\nThis post is crazy \ud83d\udc80 YTA OP", "She is 14 she knows what she is doing", "reheated McDonald's would be gross and inedible.", "I second this motion!", "Maybe so, but at 14 to hear your family member call you something so hurtful will cut deep", "Then it was time for another break. Mr. Academic should know that concentration wanes after 20 minutes and that a quick break can help to refocus onto the task at hand. YTA.", "Dude, I don't know about your sister, but you're definitely an idiot... and an AH...", "Here\u2019s the thing. If she hadn\u2019t gone to get the food and stayed with you, she would\u2019ve still been thinking about the food which means she wouldn\u2019t have studied well. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to focus while max was eating and while she knew food was in the oven, esp food she likes. If you had been patient, she would\u2019ve taken like 10 mins to eat and then been happy and then would\u2019ve been free to focus on studying again. You have to think long term. If someone doesn\u2019t like to study, punishing them is not going to help them. She may not be academically inclined but she is still trying- SHE came to you for help, no one forced her to ask for help. She was trying to improve. I would apologize if I was you", "Literally the first sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should read \u201cMy brother Max (19M) and I (17M) have always...\u201d", "Third!", "That\u2019s true", "I agree, I like that judgment."]}
