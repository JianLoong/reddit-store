At home, our fridge is full of all our report cards and various achievements. \n\nMy sister Fer (14F) on the other hand, not so much.  It's quite hard to find anything that has Fer's name on the fridge, not because she's the least favourite or isn't loved by my parents, but because she doesn't have any.\n\nIn hopes of helping my sister with her academics, my mom made me and Max tutor Fer with one of the subjects she was finding difficult. Max does Maths, while I do English (and my dad does science). \n\nI've enjoyed tutoring Fer, but it seems as if the feeling is not mutual. \n\nExample: Last Friday as I was tutoring Fer, she asked if she could \"quickly\" go to the toilet. I said yes. \n\n10 minutes late she had still not returned, when I went to check on her I found her in the living room watching TV. \n\n\nYesterday afternoon Fer came to me and asked if I would please tutor her for her upcoming English test. I agreed but only if she promised to pay attention this time. \n\nFer promised she would and for a while, she stayed true to that, I was helping through something she found extremely challenging and she was working with me until Max came home with McDonald's (our parents are crazy health nuts so fast food is a rarity in our home). \n\nFer looked ready to put everything down just to eat and started claiming that all the studying was making her hungry. \n\nI told Max that we were busy and he should just leave the food in the oven and we'd heat it later. At this Fer started to whine, saying that I was being unfair by not allowing her a break.\n\n Max decided to side with her, even though he knows how much she needs this tutoring and started saying that I was being too strict. \n\nFer beamed at that and was ready to go downstairs to eat. \n\nSomething in me snapped, after all these times of trying to get Fer's attention failed, the one time it was needed she was going to leave it to eat McDonald's. \n\nI told her to not go and she didn't listen, this angered me very much, she was still not listening to me, \n\nI raised my voice ( Max says I yelled) and told her \"Fer, this is the reason why you're behind all your classes! You're in all these extra classes like the piece of shit you are for a reason. Why won't you listen, you idiot\". \n\nShe immediately began crying loud ugly sobs.  \nafter I had \"yelled\" at her while Max gave her hug.   \n\nWhen my parents came home, they were more annoyed that I had called my sister \"an idiot\" than the fact that she would not listen to me when I was repeatedly trying to get her to do some work. \n\nWhen I asked Max why he decided to side with Fer he said that \"there was no point anyway because it was inevitable that she was going to fail\".  \n\nFer won't even look me in the eyes, but she's been all over Max for helping her that afternoon. \n\nFeel like everyone forgets that she's 14, not 4 because she's the youngest.\n\nAITA for wanting my sister to do some work?", "created_utc": 1677970323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ifwod/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_eat/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Calling your sister an idiot is not a way to get her to do what she wants. \n\nAlso neither one of you should be tutoring her. Your parents should be discussing steps with her teachers. Perhaps your sister has a learning disability or some folks are just smart in other areas beside school.", "YTA. I understand that you're frustrated by her attitude during your tutoring but calling her names is completely uncalled for. You should go apologize to her before she decides to resent you. Your brother also sounds pretty shitty though with that \"she's gonna fail anyway\" line, doesn't sound like he has much respect for her", "Holy god long story that could have been short", "YTA.

No sibling is going to listen to an older sibling who calls them names and berates them. The fact you don\u2019t know this despite you professing how intelligent you are astounds me. \n\nThe fact is? She might need tutoring but ultimately? It\u2019s not on you to keep her on track with it and it certainly isn\u2019t on you to call her an idiot or tell her that she is the reason she is failing. I found school exceptionally easy as a child, I had the same delusion that anyone struggling just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough when the reality is? People can just struggle with certain concepts. People can have barriers that they find it really hard to get past when it comes to education. YTA 100 times over.", "YTA - Go apologise to your little sister. You're suppose to be her brother, what kind of brother gets annoyed at his sister for wanting to eat and taking a break from studying. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA on so many levels it's astounding.", "YTA.  Maybe she was hungry.  Maybe she just needed a break to then refocus.  Maybe she wasn\u2019t feeling motivated.  Who knows?  You certainly never will, because you\u2019ve made clear that you have no interest in what she\u2019s feeling. The way you responded to her was awful.\n\nI will also throw a bit of TA your parents\u2019 way.  I have kids in the tween to teen age ranges.  Some are stronger academically than others, but all of them have areas where they shine.  Exam papers are not the only thing that should go on the fridge.", "YTA McDonalds is horrible if not eaten fresh you should have let her enjoy the rare treat, do you honestly think that the tutoring getting in the way of her enjoying something that she gets access to so rarely is going to make her engage more in the sessions?", "YTA just for wanting to reheat McDonalds.\nthe abuse makes you a momentous asshole.\nwhy be a dick? youre almost a grown man. \nwhy tf does she need your permission to go to the restroom?\nall the kids in this family need therapy", "YTA, first for trying to stop her from eating, second for treating her as if she's you.\n\nNot everyone is 'brilliant' like you and you're forgetting she's 14.", "YTA. You are a literal child trying to boss another child around. Some may say that 17 is an adult\u2026well you sure didn\u2019t act like that by calling your child sister a piece of shit and an idiot now did you?", "YTA, you didn't just yell, you chose to verbally abuse her, it's no wonder she's upset with you. You definitely need to apologise to her for that.\n\nAlso, I really don't want to assume anything, but I feel like there might be a reason why Fer is having issues with studying, perhaps a different approach / technique is needed for her? If she is struggling because of a possible neurodivergent condition then she might need some additional help, help which you and your family (at this point in time) wouldn't be able to provide for her.", "YTA. Calling her an idiot isn't going to help her.  Also, you and your brother should not be tutoring her. You might do well academically, but that doesn't make you a good tutor for a student who is already struggling. It also might be easier for your sister to listen to a non-relative more seriously than her brothers.", "YTA. You have zero authority over your sister.", "YTA for sure. Perhaps wonder why she finds it so hard to focus, and that if someone is avoiding doing something, it's not because they are lazy or whatever. Maybe Fer just finds it really hard or isn't understanding, or even feels embarrassed when they see all you and your bro's stuff on the fridge and feels like there's no point. It sounds like you aren't considering how SHE learns, in fact it sounds like you have very little understanding and empathy of her. Different students have different needs, and instead of belittling her, you should actually help to encourage her. You and your brother should be ashamed of how you speak to her. If you tell someone they suck, they will suck.\n\nPlus, reheated McDonald's sucks, why you gotta do her like that when it's such a treat in your household?", "YTA. You and your brother sound naturally gifted. Good for you. It also sounds like that's a lot of pressure on your younger sibling. I highly doubt she's any less intelligent than you two, just feels constant weight on her shoulders that's stressing her out. You're almost always in the wrong if you call someone an idiot, especially your younger sister who is trying to learn. Apologize.", "YTA why couldnt you eat and then get back to studying? Or srudy while you eat.\n\nHell i did all my homework/studying during commercial breaks and i made honor roll every semester.", "YTA, pretty big one at that too", "YTA people can\u2019t concentrate when they\u2019re hungry. Giving her a break to eat would have made it easier for her to study", "YTA including your parents.\n\nRewarding kids based on food.They're going to give her an eating disorder. \n\nAlso in the real world 90% kids who are academically inclined or on honor roll have essentially the same jobs as everyone else.", "YTA. You called your 14 year old sister a \"piece of shit\" and an \"idiot\". This isn't about her fucking eating. This is about you being cruel. Clearly, you cannot control your temper and you shouldn't be tutoring her anymore. Get either Max or your Dad to take over English, and apologize to your sister for calling her horrible things.", "You need more than a tutor. Yikes. YTA", "YTA, denying food and then insulting her? Asssssshole.", "Your whole family sucks except your sister. You all are awful to her and treat her as less than because she\u2019s not as academically gifted as you.

Shame on all of you, Y-T-A and I hope Fer finds people who actually like her in the future.\n\nETA: changing my vote to ESH excluding Fer.", "YTA, jeez what you said was really hurtful and uncalled for. Also what your brother said at the end was messed up too, the lack of faith he had in her is honestly messed up. She needs an actual tutor, maybe go to the library to help her focus.", "YTA. \n\nThere is more to a person than academic success. Does she have other strengths? Do you even know what they are? You clearly see her as less than because she isn\u2019t academically gifted. \n\nIs she actually failing, or is the just not as good as you and your brother?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to hire an actual tutor for her, as teaching and helping people is a skill, and it sounds like you don\u2019t have the patience for it. \n\nYour parents really can\u2019t find /something/ to be proud of her for to put on the fridge?", "YTA. You want her to pay attention. She is going to do that a lot better with food than with sitting there thinking about and being distracted by the food.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't tutor someone and expect them to have an easy time. Things that come to you don't come easily to her, that's why she needs help. If you don't have the patience to teach her and deal with the fact her studying rhythm is different and her attention span is shorter, **don't**. It's much better than you blowing up like that and diminishing her confidence further. Abd for the record, it seems like you do feel superior to her because of your academic achievements, and it sure came out in your outburst. That's really really hurtful.\n\nI'm sure it's not easy for her to struggle in school when you guys seem to be doing stellar. For all you know she may have a learning disability, or she just needs a different explanation - doesn't matter. The way you spoke to her was a no go, and you owe her a big apology.", "ESH. \nYour parents should not be burdening you and Max with your sister\u2018s problems.\n\nMax should not be negative and say that his sister is going to fail.\n\nBy far, the biggest AH is you. You should probably consider therapy for your anger issues.", "YTA. Jeez, you totally overreacted. Good thing you're not a professional tutor or teacher because you're clearly bad at it. What you said to your sister was verbally abusive. It only would have taken a few minutes to eat the food and then she could get back to work. Screaming and cursing at her won't motivate her.", "Guessing your sister doesn't enjoy tutoring since other people (you) don't seem to make learning enjoyable as it should be. Would suggest not to choose teaching as a career.", "YTA - you shouldn\u2019t be calling her names. Does she have a hard time sitting still and concentrating? You may have to change how you tutor her. I couldn\u2019t sit still studying for long periods of time (No I don\u2019t have ADHD). What worked for me was setting a timer. I would study for 30 minutes and get a 5-10 minute break. By breaking it up in chunks it kept my attention and had me look forward to a small treat if I concentrated for the required time.", "YTA I struggled in school my whole life. Studying on empty stomach never helped me. Fast food doesn\u2019t taste good once it is cold. You couldn\u2019t let her have 20 minute break to eat. Did you try to make studying fun at all? Maybe the she needs to study a different way? People have learning styles. I am visual hands on person. Just telling me to read something doesn\u2019t help and I can never remember it.", "ESH - she's 14 and she's behind for a reason.    If your parents aren't going to step in and make sure the tutoring is 'doable' then she'll be behind.   Is there something wrong with her attention span?      People don't fail that much without something behind it.    Your parents need to put some boundaries in place that penalize her for non-compliance.    Somehow she needs to learn that she's not in school for her social life.  She's there to get an education and skills so she can function in society.    I understand your frustration with her and trying to get her focused, but you need to get your parents on board with her lack of cooperation in tutoring.", "I'm going to go with YTA for shouting at her, especially if she'd been behaving before that, but I feel you. I was always booksmart and older, and my sister took forever to learn how to read. She's smart, but basically parents didn't make school a priority for her. \n Dad was effing lazy, so he appointed me with turoring her (we might have been 7 or 8 and 13ish?), which I didn't mind, but she had zero interest and kept trying to hop off to watch tv or whatever. I pretty much decided I was asked to help her learn how to read, not how to sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes and gave up really quickly.", "Yta for insulting her. If she fails then she fails that's on her.", "ESH. You should have just let her eat. But it sounds like she regularly doesn't take tutoring seriously which is disrespectful of your time. I also think it was risky of your parents to \"make\" you tutor her because I imagine being both a sibling and a teacher can't be easy.", "ESH  \n\n\nThe whole situation sounds awful, and nobody seems healthy, or supportive at all. You and your brother shouldn't have to tutor your sister, and you shouldn't feel obligated to. It's her life, and she needs to learn that her actions have consequences on her own. It's your parents job to parent her, not yours. What you said was mean, and it definitely sounds like you meant it to hurt on purpose. Stop tutoring her, and mind your own business. If she wants to fail, even with people willing to help her, that's on her.", "INFO - has your sister ever been tested for ADHD?\n\nIt could be nothing but the way you describe her behavior sounds *exactly* like my daughter who has it pretty strongly.", "YTA. Regardless of the source, she clearly has low focus. Instead of working with it, you expect her to just sit and power through, as if that's done her any good before. She might have an untreated disorder that makes schoolwork more difficult for her, and you being an AH about it isn't going to magically make her grades improve and the focus problems go away. People that can't focus *do* actually need breaks to refocus. They can't just do it all in one sitting.", "NTA if the parents were paying for the tutor they wouldn't be siding with the sister. They would be telling her to pay attention. Should you have called her an idiot - no. But the fact that you are taking time out of your day to tutor her and she's not paying attention is very frustrating.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I said yes.\"\nThese are the first sentences I've read that don't require a correction.\n\n\n\"10 minutes late she had still not returned, when I went to check on her I found her in the living room watching TV. \"\n\nOh boy, there's a lot going on here. Here's the correct version of this sentence: \"Ten minutes later, she still had not returned. When I went to check on her, I found her in the living room, watching TV.\"\n\nFirst, you can't begin a sentence with numerical numbers. It should read \"Ten\", not \"10\". Second, it should be later, not late. Third, if a time description is written at the beginning of the sentence, it should be followed by a comma. Fourth, OP's sentence contains a comma splice, which is a type of run-on sentence. You can't join two independent clauses (a part of a sentence that can stand as a sentence on its own) with a comma. Fifth, I strongly prefer to add a comma before the gerund \"watching\" in this sentence. I would have to do more research to get to the specifics as to why, but it's late so I'm not doing that right now.\n\n\n\"Yesterday afternoon Fer came to me and asked if I would please tutor her for her upcoming English test.\"\n\nOnce again, there should be a comma after the dependent time clause \"Yesterday afternoon\".\n\n\n\"I agreed but only if she promised to pay attention this time.\"\n\nI would add a comma before the word \"but\" here, though it's not strictly necessary from my understanding.\n\n\n\"Fer promised she would and for a while, she stayed true to that, I was helping through something she found extremely challenging and she was working with me until Max came home with McDonald's (our parents are crazy health nuts so fast food is a rarity in our home).\"\n\nThis is a run-on sentence. There are way too many ideas contained within the sentence, along with a comma splice. There are a few different ways it could be written correctly, but I'll present my preferred option here: \"Fer promised she would and, for a while, she stayed true to that. I was helping her work through something she found extremely challenging. She was working with me until Max came home with McDonald's. Our parents are crazy health nuts, so fast food is a rarity in our home.\"\nMost of the problems here have been touched upon in previous sentence corrections, but I can elaborate if anyone has follow-up questions or suggestions.\n\n\"Fer looked ready to put everything down just to eat and started claiming that all the studying was making her hungry.\"\nI can't definitively say there's anything wrong with this sentence, though I do find the phrasing \"just to eat\" a little awkward. If it stayed as is, I would follow that phrase with a comma.\n\n\n\"I told Max that we were busy and he should just leave the food in the oven and we'd heat it later.\"\n\nThis is fine, though I would say \"so we could heat it later\" to avoid the double \"and\".\n\n\n\"At this Fer started to whine, saying that I was being unfair by not allowing her a break.\"\n\nI would say, \"At this request, Fer started to...\" First, \"at this\" on its own feels insufficient here. Second, there should be a comma after the dependent clause because it came at the start of the sentence.\n\n\n\"Max decided to side with her, even though he knows how much she needs this tutoring and started saying that I was being too strict.\"\nThere should be a comma after the word \"tutoring\" to fully define the dependent clause.\n\n\n\"Fer beamed at that and was ready to go downstairs to eat.\"\n\nThis is fine, though my preference would, again, be to add a comma after \"that\". I would also prefer to define what \"that\" is (i.e. at Max's support).\n\n\"Something in me snapped, after all these times of trying to get Fer's attention failed, the one time it was needed she was going to leave it to eat McDonald's.\"\n\nHere's my corrected version and a brief breakdown: \"Something in me snapped. After all these times trying to get Fer's attention failed, the one time it was needed, she was going to leave to eat McDonald's.\" I've mostly corrected some punctuation here, but I also removed an unnecessary preposition. I don't love OP's choice of words because they feel clunky, but that's not strictly a grammatical error.\n\n\"I told her to not go and she didn't listen, this angered me very much, she was still not listening to me,\"\n\nMore punctuation problems. There are two comma splices, and OP ended a sentence with a comma instead of a period.", "\"My mom made Max and I tutor Fer\" should actually be \"My mom made Max and me tutor Fer.\"\n\nThe easiest way to differentiate I vs. me situations like that is to take the other person (Max) out of the sentence. You wouldn't say \"My mom made I tutor her.\"", "Also:\n\n>> It\u2019s quite hard to find anything that has Fer\u2019s name on the fridge\n\nThat sentence structure is unclear. It should be \u2018**with** Fer\u2019s name on the fridge\u2019 or \u2018that has Fer\u2019s name on on the fridge\u2019.", "a small correction to your correction: the statement should be \"my mom made Max and me tutor Fer\", *not* \"my mom made Max and I tutor Fer\". per your own comment previously \u2014 one would not say \"my mom made I tutor Fer\". Max should still come first in the list of subjects, though", "I'm not the previous poster, but I did one!", "Thank you for doing this.", "And the one that helped her thinks she\u2019s a failure.

You're in all these extra classes like the piece of shit you are for a reason. Why won't you listen, you idiot'.\"\n\nFirst, OP has an unnecessary space before the open parenthesis, which shouldn't be there. However, I would prefer em dashes over parentheses because it's expressing a potentially contrary emotion. The use of the parentheses could be argued, though, and I'm not set on my preference. Second, there should be a question mark after \"you idiot'\" rather than a period because (duh) it's a question.\n\n\n\"She immediately began crying loud ugly sobs.  after I had \"yelled\" at her while Max gave her hug.\"\n\nHere we have a sentence fragment, where OP used a period instead of a comma. A dependent clause can't stand on its own and needs an independent clause to support it in a sentence. There's also an article, \"a\", missing before the word \"hug\".\n\n\n\"When my parents came home, they were more annoyed that I had called my sister 'an idiot' than the fact that she would not listen to me when I was repeatedly trying to get her to do some work.\"\n\nHere, OP puts \"an idiot'\" in quotes, but only the word \"idiot\" should be quoted because he actually said \"you idiot\".\n\n\n\"When I asked Max why he decided to side with Fer he said that 'there was no point anyway because it was inevitable that she was going to fail'.\"\n\nI spy more punctuation problems. Here's my version: \"When I asked Max why he decided to side with Fer, he said that there was no point anyway because it was inevitable that she was going to fail'.\" First, OP forgot to put a comma after the dependent clause at the beginning of his sentence (again). Second, using the word \"that\" before a quote is not correct. If you're paraphrasing, you say, \"He said that...\" without using any quotation marks, because quotation marks indicate direct speech. The word \"that\" in this context indicates indirect speech. It's also important to note that a comma should be used before a direct speech quotation if you indicate who is speaking beforehand.\n\n\n\"Fer won't even look me in the eyes, but she's been all over Max for helping her that afternoon.\"\n\nThis is fine.\n\n\n\"Feel like everyone forgets that she's 14, not 4 because she's the youngest.\"\n\nFirst, OP forgot the subject in this sentence. It should read, \"I feel\". Second, there should be a comma after the numerical \"4\".\n\n\n\"AITA for wanting my sister to do some work?\"\n\nGrammatically, this is fine, although I believe OP is asking the wrong question.\n\nHopefully this was enjoyable and/or helpful to you!

I\u2019m good at getting them hyped! But I\u2019m not the one to sit and teach fundamentals. It won\u2019t be productive.\n\nDifferent skill sets entirely,"]}
