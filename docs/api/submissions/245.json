I was a little concerned because both her and B were completely silent for a good month, no texts, no calls, it was like they disappeared. \n\nDuring this time I took the advice of some commenters and apologized to my J for trying to force a better relationship between him and B, and for brushing off the bullying that B put him through. He said that he forgives me, but I still want to work on being a better sister. \n\nA few weeks ago I got a message from G asking if we could meet at a restaurant and if I could bring J with me. I asked why, especially after all the silence, and she told me that her and B wanted to talk. I informed J about this, I wanted to know what was going on so I was gonna go, but I told him that he didn't have to go with me if he didn't want to. He told me that he thinks he'll be able to handle it, and if B still treats him the same he'll just leave.\n\nMe and J went together, when we got there I could sense that B was feeling nervous. He looked like he was about to cry. Me and G started the conversation with just catching up with each other on what's been happening since we last met. At some point though, B cracked, he took a deep breath and looked at G.\n\nB started a speech about how we grew up and my mind was racing trying to figure out where this was going, until suddenly I just heard the words \"I'm bisexual\" and everything cleared up. B went on to talk about how he's felt he needed to hide this his whole life, he was envious towards J for being able to express himself so openly, which led him to start bullying J and pushing him deeper and deeper into the closet. It ended with him apologizing to J and asking for forgiveness.\n\nJ was quiet for this whole talk until he felt it was his turn to speak. He said \"B, I hear you, I know where you're coming from, I understand where you're coming from but none of that excuses the shit you've put me through since we were teens. I can and will try to forgive you, but it's going to take a lot of effort on your end\"\n\nThe rest of the night was a bit of a blur for me (there was alcohol involved) but I do recall B and J cry-hugging by the end, which I was very glad to see. J says that there's still a bit of awkwardness between the two of them, but with time he thinks he might just see B as his nice older brother again. \n\nAs for the wedding, it's back on but with an undecided date as of right now, and yes J is going to be allowed in this time, he can even bring his boyfriend along with him. B's even decided to have J be a groomsman and told him \"you can act as gay as you want J\", which I don't think is the best thing to say but I like the sentiment.", "created_utc": 1667134807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhdpk9/update_aita_for_bailing_on_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 3178, "replies": ["Dang - way to go G!

I like to read AITA posts to my GF and we share our perspectives of the stories. When I read your original post I said, \u201chaha clearly B is in the closet and jealous!\u201d  Now here we are.", "I'm glad B came to his senses and that J is willing, in time, to forgive B. B is very lucky that his fianc\u00e9e clearly got him to open up.\nIf I were J I don't know if I would be so able to forgive after years of abuse and that abuse being ignored.", "OP, you\u2019re amazing for standing up for your bro despite your family. I have to say though that it looks like G is the true hero here. If the marriage doesn\u2019t work out, keep her in the divorce. I\u2019m going to guess that she sent B to invite J and he just messed it up, she spoke up to everyone and said that you\u2019re not the reason for the delay, she made that choice, then she helped B come to terms with his sexuality, supported him with it, and brought you all together to talk it out!! Does her wedding gown have a cape? Can you help her add one? It can still be white, but a superhero should have a cape.", "I love this update! J sounds like an amazingly strong person.", "Yeah I love this update. I hope B does the work needed to repair the relationship with J. G sounds like a wonderful fianc\u00e9 too!", "Oh my god, \n  \n\"I hear you, I know where you're coming from, I understand where you're coming from...\"\n  \nSeriously, because he DOES.  \n  \nSelf-loathing is not an excuse for bullying. \n  \nI am so happy for J that he seems so well adjusted and confident in himself. I hope that B can get to that point.", "Yay! Best kind of update and it sounds like the fiancee is a keeper.", "Thanks for the update!! Hope everything continues in a positive and uplifting way. Sounds like you guys are off to good start. \n\nI\u2019m still over here chuckling at that last line, \u201cdon\u2019t think that was the best thing to say, but I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "Aww bless", "J's response was so good, he seems like he's way more in touch with his feelings than B is.

Good luck to everyone involved and big congrats to B for joining the Bi Squad B)", "Why did B have the feeling he couldn\u2018t come out?", "The best kind of update. Glad you all managed to work something out and are moving forward in a better direction.\n\nIt's so incredibly common for people in the closet to be homophobic, though of course that doesn't excuse any of the damage he caused, B was obviously the asshole. But I think he's on the right path to make up for his mistakes.\n\nHope you all have a lovely wedding.", "This is a nice update. I hope your brother can work through this.", "I\u2019m really happy to hear this update and B\u2019s wife seems to be really good for him. I hope B continues to become a better man and can possibly get therapy for his issues. Lmao at \u201cbe as gay as you want\u201d that\u2019s weirdly cute and funny and definitely a step in the right direction. Kudos to you for listening to the advice people gave and for being a good sister.", "i hope B knows how lucky he is that J is even willing to give him a chance. bullying is awful, and can even be deadly. there\u2019s a reason suicide rates are higher in lgbtq+ youth. and from a family member no less. i hope B goes to therapy. he has a whole lot of self reflection to do. props to J for even hearing him out, i\u2019d have gone NC years ago. also G sounds great.", "Nice update ,nice ending", "This was so nice and wholesome i hope its a starts a new chapter for the family! Love nice update posts", "I'm almost crying...thanks for sharing the update.", "Damn, G is a real G here.", "Now do the same with the family who meh\u2019ed bullying.  No free wedding planning service", "Thanks for the surprising update,, absolutely no assholes here", "Man I still hate brother B, I hate it more that he's just another queer person hating on someone else for being happy. Like J is so strong and I hope he maintains his boundaries so that, more than likely When not if, B acts out again he can just walk away because he doesn't deserve to be treated like that. It's so wrong cuz from the tone of this it does just sound like B is trying to use his coming out to wash away what he did and not actually make amends to J", "Too many single letter names. It\u2019s confusing.", "Poor J. I don't know If would gracious enough toeven try to forgive B. I wouldn't want anything from him. Nothing excuse what he made J go through.", "Ha. I read your original post right before this one, and I had the thought that B was totally gay and projecting onto J.

To make matters worse people only wanted to hear one side of the story they didn't care to hear the truth or the other side.\n\nIt's OK he has come out now but it still doesn't excuse the way he was treating j over the past or the way to the present time. J accepted himself and mastered the courage to come out, while B never accepted himself and chose to remain in the closest. The worst thing someone can do to a queer person is trying to push them back in the closest. It's amazing that now he is open and has accepted himself as has owned up to his mistakes and is working to make things better and right with J.", "Maybe I\u2019m crazy, but I feel like I have read this story before or something similar too it", "Read both posts back to back, and I just have so much respect and admiration for all of you! Thank you for this lovely update. I wish you all the best going forward!", "This post is so heartwarming that I'm going to bed now, no need to scroll further because,  \nit's reddit lol\n\nI'm so happy for you OP, this feels like the beginning of a new chapter for your family \u2764\ufe0f", "Wow! What an amazing woman he is marrying! Perfect to add to an amazing brother and sister!", "I can't help but to think about his fianc\u00e9. Has he explored his feelings for men? Will he ever feel the need to experience a relationship with a man if he hasn't allowed himself to open all this time? I don't really want an answer as it's not my business I'm just wondering how G feels and how this relationship will play out", "I shouldn't have shouted I KNEW IT when I saw the words I'm bisexual but I did and I do and I can. I knew B was in the closet about something", "I don\u2019t understand how everyone was attacking OP for \u201cruining the wedding\u201d but no one had a problem with the blatant homophobia or one brother treating the other like shit.

Or just give them fake names. The whole secret agent one letter initial thing is really distracting.", ">\"you can act as gay as you want J\"\n\nThis made me burst out laughing.

Nothing will take back what he did to J. He can use whatever excuse he wants but it\u2019s just who he is.", "Clearly B\u2019s taste in fianc\u00e9 is fantastic. Maybe his taste in appropriate sibling relationships will improve to match.", "She's honestly one of those rare people that needs to be valued and protected and i hope this family realizes what an asset she is. What a gem!!", "Yeah, I am almost annoyed it\u2019s such a cliche at this point. I\u2019m glad things are finally out in the open with room for improvement though.", "I read the original post before reading the update and thought the same thing (especially that part where the fiancee put the wedding on hold).", "WOW, I'd have never seen this coming. But I guess it was obvious to some folks lol. I was really happy to read this update though - thanks OP for sharing and I hope everyone heals and ends up happy.", "I thought the same thing. Projection is a hell of a drug ...", "Yep, called it. As soon as I read the update about the fiancee talking about \"other issues in the relationship\" I was like, mmm-hmmmm.", "I missed that when reading the first post.  You were ahead of me.", "That's really cute.", "Big up to G as well for putting the screws to B, possibly at the cost of her relationship, in order to get to the bottom of it. \n\nThough I guess she might have considered the relationship a loss anyway if B had turned out to just be a bigot.", "I'm definitely very grateful for everything G's done for our family, we've both been super close friends since B introduced me to her, and after this whole situation I'll make sure she gets the best wedding she could ever hope for", "Yeah I'm super proud of the person he's become! At times I think he might be the most mature sibling between the three of us", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  J is amazing. And OP, thank you for the update and for taking the important step of no longer planning B's wedding so eventually all of this came out and everyone can heal.  I'm happy for everyone, and I hope the wedding, when it takes place is fabulous.", "I really appreciate how he responded to B opening up and explanation. I feel a lot of people either just automatically forgive someone (and often allow themselves to be doormats, or don\u2019t actually mean it) or swear to never forgive them. \n\nReally gives insight to his maturity and ability to communicate.", "Me too ahahah! I\u2019m almost emotional about this update lol", "If B behaves well, we\u2019ll make him act as bi as he wants to lol", "I wasn't able to fit this into the story but our family lived with our grandparents up until me and B were around 11. They lived in a very conservative small town and I'm guessing that's what influenced B to hide himself. Our parents were eventually able to move out to a more progressive city by the time we were 12 and J was 7. But I think B still kept some of the ideals from our old town while J was better able to adapt to the new environment.", "Same!! This is so sweet! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Really no asshole? I was a busy but because I am bisexual forgive me, no he was an arse and it should take him being comfortable being gay to come stop being a jerk", "Uh, no. B was an AH. He\u2019s trying to recover, but he was thoroughly an AH initially. I\u2019m not surprised he was one of the classic types of over-the-top homophobes, the self-loathers. The update is good, B is trying to make amends, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the previous post was a bit ESH with OP trying to force J and B to be friendly until finally giving up. Both OP and B are trying to change their behavior, which is good.", "There are literally *three* characters aside from OP.", "Sorry about that, I didn't want to expose any personal info in the original post but looking back it might have been easier to understand if I had just used fake names.", "Op has brother. Op brother was bad bad to op other gay brother. Op brother than says he bi. They hug. Story over", "So rare to see a positive fianc\u00e9e story on here", "Yeah I agree but it is the way it is. Many cultures put a crazy amount of pressure on people to fit into binary gender roles/images and the reality is that everyone is different. It\u2019s too bad that guys like B feel they need to deflect that attention in such a destructive way, when clearly J is better adjusted, mostly because his life went in such a way that the safest path seemed to be to buck the social pressure to fit in and just find his way without the self hatred and everything else.", "It is as cliche as the posts about inlaws that for some unknowable reason hate their kids partner and in the update it turns out that they are racist.", "When I read the original, I assumed the fiance is bi and B had been crap to her in the past.", "I assumed the fianc\u00e9 has lgbt family.", "[removed]", "I thought it meant the fiancee had really realized what bigoted bully her fiance is. That would definitely be a relationship issue for me. However the update really made it all make sense. Still no excuse for bullying J so badly, but B has taken major steps here so there's that.", "I agree. It\u2019s clear it was extremely important to her, B is really lucky to have such an amazing fianc\u00e9 and brother. OP may have made mistakes in the past trying to be a mediator in the wrong way but she understood it. It\u2019s so wholesome to read this update anyway, I really hope they can build a loving and caring relationship one for all between the three of them, with G cheering on the side looking at her great work lol", "Do you think B is really bi?  I think he might be gay", "Right?!?! So rarely do we see these stories turning positive!", "\"It's my party I can bi if I want to\"", "That makes sense since he's the oldest and grew up around the area more.", "I\u2019m bisexual. When I was 14 my friend came out to me and I basically clammed up and said nothing. I never said anything negative but I just was uncomfortable I guess? 4 years later we were still best friends and I realized I was bisexual as well. We had always been on good terms and I never got wierd when she mentioned anything lgbt but I realized how I might have come across that one night when she was vulnerable with me. It had always haunted me but once I realized my own sexuality it made me feel even worse. I  apologized to her one night and came out her and she said it was totally fine, it definitely wasn\u2019t the worst reaction she had but she appreciated me realizing that my uncomfortable response made her feel bad and she was proud of me for realizing my own sexuality. I understand to a extent how struggling with your own sexuality can make you a bit uncomfortable with others being open. But I was never rude or exclusionary. I can\u2019t relate to that and considering how guilty I felt for just being dismissive, I wouldn\u2019t imagine if I were actively hostile and being a bully about it. I hope they can repair their relationship but I wouldn\u2019t blame bro for not forgiving him", "He's bi, not gay.", "Seriously! It really feels like he used his coming out as an excuse for how he behaved and is now just using it to try and wash away what he did", "in the original post he was abslutley the asshole, and he was an asshole for manny years, but in this post i don't judge him to be the asshole...", "Why can\u2019t he call them \u201cBig Bro\u201d, \u201cLittle Bro\u201d and \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d?", "bot?", "Agreed.  It appears the fianc\u00e9e is quite an influence on B.", "What makes you think that?", "?", "His apology, admitting his issues, agreeing to try to be better, asking the brother to bring his boyfriend, and asking his brother to be a groomsman moved him out of TA territory. He **was** but no longer **is**.", "I'm glad you mentioned this because I thought I was the only one whose brain got confused by just initials. \n\nFWIW, I have discovered that if I mentally substitute a short name that starts with that letter, then I can keep track much easier. It sounds like this would be more complicated to remember but for some reason it works for me. For example, as far as my brain is concerned, G is short for Gina.", "Yep, it's a bot. Copying part of another message from lower in the chain.", "Bot, stolen from bowtie2017", "Because he's in the process of marrying a woman, duh.", "I think that\u2019s what they said\u2026", "Huh? The person I responded to thought B, a man, might be gay, as in exclusively attracted to men. So I was wondering why the commentor thought B was gay and not bi despite B saying that he's bi. I know he's marrying a woman.", "It was a joke. They used \u201cduh\u201d instead of /s.", "You know, it occurred to me a few hours later that they were probably being sarcastic lol. Thank you though for confirming what I eventually realized"]}
