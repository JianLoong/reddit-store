{"id": 3126, "submission_id": "z3hzo2", "title": "AITA for asking my wife to block my brother on Instagram?", "selftext": "My parents own a large manufacturing company. I (31M) joined the company straight after college 10 years ago. My younger brother (M29) joined a couple years after. We\u2019ve been learning and training for all these years to eventually take over for my father who plans to retire in a couple of years.\n     \nGrowing up my brother and I never got along. I wouldn\u2019t call the relationship toxic but we fought fairly regularly and never hung out together outside of normal family outings. When we started to have to work together we essentially just put our differences to the side and cooperated mostly smoothly. Life outside of work never changed though - i.e. we still never had a relationship outside of work aside from outings that my parents initiated. We never even followed each other on social media.\n     \nMy father now is approaching retirement. He\u2019s made it clear that the company will be run by my brother and me in the next 1-2 years, maybe even sooner. The company will be left to us as well. Over the last couple years, our responsibilities have stepped up and we\u2019ve needed to cooperate even more closely on daily issues. During these last couple years I\u2019ve felt tension rising between us but ultimately we continued to put the company first and manage to make things work mostly fine. \n     \nRecently though, things have changed. My brother has begun to say some really hurtful things to me in the course of business that I really can\u2019t cease to ignore anymore. I\u2019m not perfect but lately his comments have been very targeted, personal, and hypocritical. He attacks my character, managing techniques and more while even badmouthing me behind my back to my father without a chance to defend myself. I can take criticism, but not from a hypocrite who certainly has his owns flaws, repeats the same behaviors for which he insults me, and then firmly denies them. \n     \nIt\u2019s weighing on me now though, heavily. \nYesterday I had the idea to request that she block my brother on Social Media (when we first got together 5 years ago she followed him on social media sort of acting as a back channel connection, if that makes any sense). \n\nShe rejected the idea saying she felt it would be too awkward for her when she saw my brother again. I explained that I feel I have no other way to convey to my brother how disappointed I am in the way he treats me and I wanted to send him a signal by cutting off all non-work related connection. She continued to reject the idea and I told her I felt her response was unsupportive. This resulted in a fight.\n\nFor more context, my wife had a terrible relationship with her father growing up & spent much of her upbringing with her mother. From the day I met my wife I completely respected the situation and supported her 100% in her basically very limited contact with her father, let alone not inviting him to our wedding. But when it comes to my family and simply requesting that my wife support me in blocking my brother on IG it\u2019s \u201ctoo awkward.\u201d\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669290675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3hzo2/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_block_my_brother_on/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For me YTA because you are effectively having your wife do the dirty work. She will be the bad guy and potentially disrespected by your brother. I can't imagine asking my husband to deliberately fall out with a family member on my behalf. \n\nYou need to address this with him. You tell him how you feel and that you are cutting him off personally. She doesn't need to be involved in that.\n\nTo be clear though, if you are equal partners in business you need to sort yourselves out. Your work environment will be toxic to all if you cannot grow up and stop badmouthing each other. If you are equal in decision making you have to find a way to agree. If you can't find a way to separate.", "First of all, your wife's relationship with her father has nothing to do with this post.  It's like you threw that in there just to try to prove that your wife isn't being as accommodating as you were to her.  \n\nIn my opinion, trying to use social media to prove a point is a really immature thing to do almost every time.  Chances are, it won't do anything except make it more akward between your wife and brother, like you wife said.  Also, what is her blocking him even supposed to do?  Like, what's your end game?  How is your wife blocking him going to change your relationship with him in the company?  I don't understand how, in your mind, you made the connection between your bad professional relationship with your brother, and your wife simply following him on social media.  I don't necessarily think you're an AH, but I don't think this would have the outcome you want, and you are simply dragging your wife into a conflict that you are having with your brother.", "The business will fold if its left to both you and your brother.  You may want to talk to your dad about your issues with your brother and recommend that instead of a 50/50 split, he gives it as a 40/60 split with the brother that has a minority share not working in the business and only collecting a check.", "YTA. Your relationship with your brother is between you and your brother and perhaps your father or the rest of the company. This is not about your wife and your brother, it's not as though she cheated on you with him, for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I explained that I feel I have no other way to convey to my brother how   \ndisappointed I am in the way he treats me and I wanted to send him a   \nsignal by cutting off all non-work related connection.\n\nWait, what?! Your wife's social media behavior should communicate something from you to your brother? So that, when you and your brother inherit the company and then proceed to destroy it because of your behavior, she's to blame?", "Oh how gracious of you to have ALLOWED your wife not to invite her estranged father to her wedding!!! Very supportive. \n\nYTA. If you're unhappy with your brother, USE YOUR WORDS, not your wife's IG account. Or, be a petty toddler and make your own IG account, friend him, THEN BLOCK HIM. Leave her out of it.", "YTA. Get a therapist, get some therapy skills, then sit down and talk to your father before it's too late. Firstly, don't put this on your wife to fix, or drag her into your drama. Secondly, your brother isn't going to understand subtle hints. Thirdly, it won't do a damn thing to actually fix the issue. You need to find out how your father wants the company run, and how on earth you're going to run a company with a person you can't stand to be around. That might not be possible, so if it only has to go to one of you, you're going to need to get a lot better at conflict resolution and communicating your feelings. You also need to be sure that this is what you want - do you want to run the company or do you want your father's approval? Clarifying your goals with a therapist, then working to achieve them, would be imho the best way forward.", "YTA simply because you can talk to your brother yourself instead of having your wife do passive aggressive things like that. You need to confront him about the shit he\u2019s doing especially since you two will be running the company together. Him talking mess about you to your dad sounds like he\u2019s trying get you out of the company so he can run it solo. You need to handle this situation yourself. Your wife is being supportive of you. She isn\u2019t forcing you to have a relationship with him she just doesn\u2019t want to be involved, which is understandable.", "YTA\n\nA better \u201csignal\u201d would be having an actual conversation with your brother. Don\u2019t drag your wife in to this petty crap and then get annoyed at her for not wanting to be part of your idiotic game playing.", "NAH. But this isn't going to work, at least not in the way you're hoping. You really need to sit down with your father and discuss your brother's actions, because as things are going this company will be dysfunctional. Stop with this passive aggressive shit and take decisive steps that literally will determine your future at this company.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is not a way to \"signal\" to your brother; she's not a tool to be used!\n\nAs an aside and having very strained relationships for decades with 2 siblings, I am \"glad\" that my OH during this has been a \"bridge\" when it was needed; eg death, accidents etc. I feel you're being short-sighted, immature, and too heavy-handed with your wife not blocking and seeing that as being unsupportive.\n\nTo \"demand\" anything from a partner is bad news and will get someone's heckles up, it's not part of a healthy relationship and I think this is why she's responding rather fervently as it's not your place and to guilt trip her into your demands with calling her unsupportive and making the link to her relationship with her father is unhelpful and incomparable.", "YTA here for asking your wife to act as your proxy instead of fighting your own battles. This person is a huge part of your life whether you like it or not, so I can understand your wife not wanting to deliberately antagonise him. This is your problem, and you need to take the lead in fixing it. Your wife can and should absolutely support you, but it's not fair of you to expect her to make the point for you.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH.\nI deleted my SIL off all my social media once she started to treat my husband like crap. Why? Because him and I are a team and I won\u2019t condone disrespect. \n\nI can see where your wife is coming from when she says it will be awkward\u2026 However a simple \u201cIt\u2019s not smart to have family on social media when things have been hostile\u201d message to your brother would help out with any awkwardness.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to ask your wife to do something. It\u2019s something else entirely when you get mad because you didn\u2019t like the answer you were given.", "YTA leave your wife out of it, fight your own battles. This is a very petty way to deal with this situation. Sit down together with your brother and father and have a real talk, be honest with yourself and with them. You two need to be able to work together in a healthy way for many years to come. You two need to learn to communicate in a healthy way now.", "ESH, if your only way of communicating your dissatisfaction with the way your brother is treating you is to have your wife block him on social media then you need serious help dealing with your emotions and learning to communicate.", "YTA. Using your wife as a pawn in your poor relationship with your brother is unkind and also useless. He will not give one soft shit that she's unfollowed him on Instagram. Set up a meeting with a mediator, do something real about this problem instead of this passive aggressive bullshit.", "Yta\n\nStop weaponising your wife and fight your battles yourself. You don't get to decide who she's friends/follows with.", "I feel there is a lot of untold but vital details here. And it doesn\u2019t smell good.\nWhy are you not interested in having a relationship with your brother?\nWhat\u2019s behind your brother\u2019s snarky remarks and comments?\nWhy do you care whether your wife follow him on instagram? Will he even notice that he has one less follower?\nWhy don\u2019t you do the adult thing and sit down with your brother to have a conversation to fix your issues?\nHow is that your father doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care whether the two of you have a healthy brotherly relationship?\n\nMy guts tell me YTA.", "I am going to say nta but an uncertain one. I don't think that you should use your wife to make a message come across to your brother. But she is also lc or nc with her family, so why can't you?", "YTA  and DUDE, you need emergency therapy or a carbon monoxide check immediately. There\u2019s something wrong with the way you are thinking. \n\nYou are paranoid, and behaving as if there\u2019s a \u201csignal\u201d that will showcase your anger at your brothers behavior. \n\nIf anything, you need help moving forward to share the reins at your family business. All of this needs to come out in the open. ALL OF IT.\n\nThe company deserves to have a fully functioning pair of CEO\u2019s because the workers do not deserve this.\n\nGet yourself help immediately.
