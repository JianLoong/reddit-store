I\u2019d consider changing the locks. Why is she using your house like a free clothing store?", "NTA. Do not overthink this. She is a theif who steals things from you. Of course she should not be allowed in your home. \n\nBTW: the socks are the tip of the iceberg. In the next few weeks, expect to discover missing alcohol, jewellery and other nonsensical stuff: framed photos, soap, a pair of shoes that don't fit her. Kleptomaniacs don't steal because they *need* something, they steal because it makes them feel good.", "Nta. She overstepped big time.", "NTA \nThere's never any peace with people like that around", "NTA. Save that video. When family try to convince you that MIL should be allowed in your home, show them the video.", "NTA. \n\nAnd needing socks but being too embarrassed to ask explains a pair, singular, until she has a chance to stop and get some. I'd almost be sympathetic on grabbing *a* pair of socks, honestly. 4 pairs is just shopping your wardrobe tho.", "NTA. Save that video.

You can\u2019t trust her.", "NTA - but there's more here than just taking socks, it's the liberty with which she feels comfortable invading your space. I think you should have a talk with her where you lay out clear boundaries on what is and isn't acceptable - and only then ban her from the house so that she doesn't use this as a way to try to slander you with family.", "NTA.\n\nYou know what's more embarrassing than asking to borrow socks? Getting caught stealing.\n\nIf she can afford money for GAS for a road trip she can afford a pack of socks. They sell those at the store. \n\nShe does not belong in your house ever again. \n\nMake sure your husband explains what happened to his brothers, otherwise she will likely lie to them and make up some ridiculous story about how awful you are.", "NTA.  But from now on I would refer to her as \"Dobby: she steals socks? There you go, maybe she's trying to get her freedom,  maybe she's just a their.  Who are you you to judge?   Treat her with same respect she's given you.", "Listen to me carefully. Evrytime you meet her, especially if She Has some friends or family with her, BE SURE TO MENTION HER THEFT OF SOCKS THAT ONE TIME, in a jovial way. \"Hey distant cousin, MIL Is coming with you to a restaurant? Be sure to supervise her not taking some cutlery, like the time She stole my Socks, hehehe\" NTA", "Nta...\nIf you are comfortable with her borrowing things telling her to ask first. It may really have been that she forgot to pack socks but it is really weird that she just took them. Make sure you put away valuable things incase she really does have a problem.", "NTA. I sure hope your BF is backing you up on this.", "NTA and if you ever do find out the reason why she reconnected the camera BEFORE stealing your socks (besides just \u201cshe makes terrible inexplicable choices\u201d), we definitely NEED that update. So weird!", "NTA and You should not even have to explain why to her.  If she has a problem with it, forward her the video of her going through your drawers, and especially her disconnecting the camera.  That says it all.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be expected to let someone like that I to your house?  She's showing zero respect for you, your home, and by extension her own son. \n\n And like, she reconnected the camera before stealing your socks specifically so you'd know she stole them?
