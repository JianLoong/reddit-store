A month into talking I developed feelings and asked her out to an upcoming tournament in Cali. She said she\u2019s down for a date and exploring but didn\u2019t see things going far after that given the distance. We continue talking (more so platonically), and planning for the trip. Before I knew I had family in LA I was going to get my own hotel but she suggested we get one together to split the costs.\n\nDay 1: We met some of her friends who also travel to these events. I did ask if she\u2019d still like to go out later but she said no reiterating the distance. Which is fine. I have no issues just being friends. After awhile she lets me know that her friends were going to hang with some other people but I can\u2019t join cause its a private thing. I didn\u2019t mind. She hugs me and I go walk around, see a movie and chill at the hotel.\n\nDay 2: Whenever I tried talking she\u2019d get annoyed and just be on her phone texting her friends. During the tournament after I finished my round, I went to see how she\u2019s doing cause we both talked about wanting to try our best. Once she finished, she\u2019d storm off to walk outside. I followed cause she\u2019s the only one I know outta 500+ ppl. After awhile I asked if everythings okay cause it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me. She said I was smothering her and didn\u2019t appreciate the forced convos. I apologized because I can understand how annoying it is when someone keeps talking. I reiterated that I thought we were hanging, but told her I\u2019d give her space. Hours later, I talk to her to figure out what\u2019s going on because I didn\u2019t want this to end our friendship.

I text her saying Imma do my own thing for the day. Hours later I run into her and ask if she\u2019d like to get food. She told me she\u2019s making plans with friends but would let me know. Back at the hotel she tells me friends are coming and potentially sleeping over. I didn\u2019t mind. She stays in the bathroom for 1hr, texting friends and blasting music. She comes out to tell me I\u2019ve creeped her out this whole time. I asked why but she said she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. Saying she\u2019d pay me back (she never did), but doesn\u2019t want me around her friends. I asked if we\u2019re still friends. She said she\u2019ll text me and storms out. I call/text my friends, mainly my female friends to wonder what\u2019s going on. The main point was that she probably changed her mind about things once she saw me irl.

You're NTA for not talking to someone who insulted you, but I'm really confused as to what escalated this situation", "She is TA.

A lot of dating behavior takes a bit of practice to master. Someone mentioning you not trading the too kinda suggests u don't have that experience to not realize some thigns might be subtly annoying. Though, Gain, she could just absolutely be TA when she didn't find u to her liking.", "NTA. Instead of just talking to you about what was going on or letting you down easy and saying she just wasn't interested in continuing this, she got mad at you multiple times and called you creepy. Honestly dude, if it were me, after the first time she snapped like that I would have just gone off and done my own thing and said forget it. Not worth pushing to be friends with someone who snaps like that instead of communicating normally", "Yeah i can only type 3k characters. What do you need to know?", "Fair point. I could definitely tell that something was up after a certain point. Although I thought either I was overthinking it or if something was up I'd just ask, she'd let me know and I'd make an effort to fix that. Plus once she told Mr she just wanted to be friends I was cool with that and didn't push for more.", "I am too, and that's why i tried talking to her and asking majority of my female friends. To figure out what's going on. I honestly don't remember everything I said to her, but I know I never made any weird physical advances or said anything inappropriate. I hugged her once only after she hugged me twice cause it was clear, \"okay this is a boundary shes fine with\". I know I made lame small talk about music and weed, cause we went to a dispenserary and idk shit about that stuff so I was curious. \n\nOfc I could've asked about things sooner and maybe I didn't do a good job of thinking about her feelings more. \n\nAfter day 2 when she told me \"we're cool but you're too much\". She went to go walk around I went to get food and try to reflect on why I was so talkative cause I'm usually way more chill. \nI let my nervousness get the better of me and tried too hard to come up with something to talk but i realized that's dumb cause literally who cares?!", "It's perfectly fine that she didn't want to be friends anymore but she didn't really communicate anything. Apparently this happened with another dude she traveled with but he told me they came to an agreement to not be friends anymore.", "That's fair. Can't write a whole lot since it's 3k characters max. What else you'd like to know? I will say a week after we agreed to do this, she asked if her friends could tag along. I was like yeah definitely. I even initially booked it for 3. Close to the trip when I asked about the others coming she let me know none of them could come.\n\nI didn't ask my friends cause none of them are into the card game. It'd be like \"Hey Josh you wanna spend hundreds of dollars on something you know nothing about and generally have no interest in only to lose to people who've played competitivly for yrs?\". One of my friends was would tell me he didn't wanna play a card game more complicated than Uno. \n\nWhat shouldve happened was once she told me none of her friends could come I shouldve canceled the hotel. Granted I'm pretty sure by then it was already to late to cancel", "Not even a little bit. I've had female friends who I used to have crushes on but we decided to be friends and that's not a problem for me. I even asked them about this situation and we hang every now and then\nShe literally said she'd be down for a date but isn't sure about things past that. I never brought it up afterwards and we continued talking and playing games more so as friends. Once we got to the place, sure I did ask about it but she said no and that's fine. I never pushed past that and was cool with just being friends. I'll definitely still take the L, for sure but to say I can't accept just being friends is wrong.", "Oof, interesting. So wanting to hang with the person you made plans with for 2 months is an asshole thing to do? Whenever she went to do her own thing I did my own thing. And once I asked if im being too much and she told me I was, I understood and chilled more. Are you saying I should've dipped asap once I could tell something was up? Seems kinda immature but yeah seems like that would've been the better move.", "what is trading the too?", "Sadly, the problem is that she didn\u2019t even want to be friends with you. She never once this whole tournament treated you like a friend. \n\nIf she was a good person she would have gotten her own room when she realized that, and you could have reimbursed her for her half of the room you got together. Instead she iced you out and then cruelly insulted you, all the while using you to save hotel costs.\n\nYou sound very socially awkward and like you had trouble understanding what she was feeling even though it was clear from her actions, and so you didn\u2019t stand up for yourself and address the awkward situation head on. \n\nI hope you did well in the tournament. \n\nNTA. But . . . . Please don\u2019t be so desperate for companionship of any kind that you let people mistreat you like this again.", "I dunno, she might just be a dramatic weirdo then \ud83e\udd37. Either way, ceasing communication is definitely the correct move", "Maybe this is how she gets free hotel rooms", "You need to make her pay you back and stop letting her walk all over you. You can tell her you have til x date to pay me or ill escalate this.", "Im just wondering if there were guys in her group of friends or just girls?", "Listen dude, from me to you, how often she blew you off for existing friends just screams she doesn't want you around them. And if she doesn't want you to meet her other friends, _she's not a friend._ Because that implies she'd be embarrassed or ashamed of being caught with you by people who recognize her.", "I thought the whole point of y\u2019all meeting up together was to hang out with each other, so it\u2019s odd she spent the whole wknd with friends. I agree with you - You\u2019re not at all an AH for wanting to do the things y\u2019all planned (which was hanging out and playing that game or whatever). \n\nGirls that like you don\u2019t do this stuff. Maybe she wanted to like you romantically or as a friend but just wasn\u2019t feeling it once y\u2019all met irl. Either way, she was rude af. Be glad she\u2019s out of your life seriously. She wasn\u2019t all of a sudden gonna start being a good friend or being interested romantically. I\u2019d have dipped out the next morning and somehow tried to get refunded for the other nights. Of course, she didn\u2019t pay her half. She\u2019s not a woman of her word. Double be glad she\u2019s out of your life! (I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s out of your life.)", "You went overboard and you know it. She politely declined your first advances. So you get a hotel together. You ask her out again, she declines again. You keep trying to talk to her, she gets more frustrated, so you *follow her outside* when she walks away. She says she doesn\u2019t appreciate forced conversations, so you \u201creiterate\u201d to her and just keep talking. You try to talk to her again hours later to see where you\u2019re at like this is a relationship, which she clearly doesn\u2019t want. She asks for space and you give it to her by continuing to text and attempting to engage with her. She literally HIDES IN THE BATHROOM to not listen to you for one more minute and you\u2019re just sitting there going on and on asking her if you\u2019re still friends. \n\nShe asked you to chill tf out and you did the exact opposite. She\u2019s 100% right you acted like a total creep. And just like in this thread, you can\u2019t take a hint and just move on.", "yea you definitely shouldve dipped as soon as she was telling you these things. Setting boundaries about what you will and wont put up with *is* actually the mature thing. And I'm talking about you. Someone who is comfortable letting you pay for their lodging while ditching you and saying you're weirding them out? Dont waste your time and money on this person and show them what you will not put up with.", "I'm with this guy. Get your money back from her and then cut her out of your life. Life lesson learned, don't go so hard for someone like that. Just because you had common ground doesn't mean you should put up with being treated like trash. And for all you know, the person who'll actually come to love you the most will share barely any interests with you.\n\nJust also want to suggest that yeah, you were a bit overbearing to say the least, and a bit too awkward to see she lost interest immediately, though it's really telling she _never_ wanted you around her friends. ESH but you sound young and inexperienced enough that it's not too much on you; you don't sound like you did any of this _intentionally._", "Sort of tried that. Cause when I bought the hotel I told her \"Hey this is how much you owe me\". But I just said to pay me whenever than for it right then and there. After all that I did send a PayPal request but after like 2 weeks of nothing I just let it go and canceled the request. But you're right I should've been more stern about that", "She does have female friends but she mainly hangs with guys.", "Makes sense. I mean she did tell me prior to the trip she made those 1st plans with friends but not that it was a \"private thing\". That she most likely made up. \n\nThere was another time were I was with her and 2 other dudes. They offered if we'd like to get food with them but as we were leaving she turned to me not wanting me to come along. \n\nBoth me and my friends don't understand how things could take a drastic turn when we talked/texted, played games and were working on a project together for a little over 3 months. And it wasn't like I was doing all the talking. It was decent back and forth. \n\nAll in all I understand I was naive as hell cause I tried way too hard to make things work and diffuse the situation by trying to talk instead of leaving", "Did you not read any of this post? Go back and read it and try again. He wanted separate hotel rooms and SHE suggested splitting one to save cost. He made it clear he was okay with just being friends and it's pretty obvious he knew at this point it wasn't going to happen with her romantically, but when she wanted space with friends he went and saw a movie and did his own thing. This is why so many guys say fuck this and stop even trying with women, everything we do now gets called creepy, and people like you take everything out of context and dig for ways to call us out.", "Woah woah I didn't not suggest getting a hotel. That was her idea. I said I was going to get my own. To be fair I should've kept it that way. \n\nWrong. I didn't keep talking after I \"reiterated\". I dipped to let her do her own thing. \n\nYeah I did try talking to her hours later cause she's my friend and I'm trying to understand what's going on. To be fair you're right I am bad with taking the hint on that front. \n\nOnce she asked for space I did give it to her, what do you mean i didnt? My female friends suggested i offer if maybe we could hang later so i said. I did text her but to be like \"Hey imma do my own thing but maybe we could hang later or tomorrow before my flight\". Keep things positive but dont push too much. Left her alone after that for awhile. I ran into her outside and was like hey would you like to do something?\". She said she's making plans so I didn't push and continued my thing (cause that obviously meant no). \n\nI did not go on and on if we're still friends. You're literally adding stuff to make me sound more annoying than I was", "You\u2019re literally doing the same thing to me right now. Thanks for making it plainly obvious you just can\u2019t let something go.", "Ight man sure. I'm literally telling you what I agree and disagree with. Like you saying I asked we get a hotel together but you just wanna say something you think is 100% correct and leave it at that. Fair.", "Still going. Ya gonna stop or just keep making me more right? \ud83d\ude02", "Learn to read before blaming op for something he is not responsible for.", "Fuck off, you're just browbeating him at this point and trying to have a last word. YTA.", "Pretty annoying when someone won\u2019t just leave ya alone, isn\u2019t it? Maybe I should reiterate? Can we still be friends? I just want to hang out and be friends.", "...I'm sorry, do you think I'm an...alt of his? Please keep going, this is really showing you off."]}
