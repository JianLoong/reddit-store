This happened a couple weeks ago, when my husband and I were at my sister's house for dinner.\n\nEverything was fine during and after the dinner itself, and we got ready to leave. I gave my sister a hig goodbye, we got in the car, and five minutes later I switched seats ane my husband drove me to the ER because my whole body was swelling up. I almost died, they had to give me an epi pen and steroids so my throat didn't close. Apparently my repeated exposure has made my allergy more severe.\n\nIt took us a while to figure out what caused the reaction, but we found out when I called my sister the morning after to tell her what happened. She does photoshoots at home as a sidegig sort of thing, and apprently had been wearing some latex outfits when she did some shoots the mlrning before that dinner. I guess she still had particles on her skin, so her hugging me triggered it.\n\nI'm not mad, she had no idea that could do anything and I get that. But I told her that with my allergy more severe if she was doing that, I couldn't really go over her house or touch her anymore. I can't risk touching any surfaces if she does after touching latex, and it could cause an even worse reaction next time.\n\nMy sister thinks I'm blaming her for my carelessness in not taking my allergy sooner. She thinks I'm projecting, but really I'm just looking out for my own safety. I just can't risk another reaction, the last one was very scary for me, and I don't want to go through that again.", "created_utc": 1685061704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ryhvx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_cant_touch_her_or_go/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your desire to not die from your allergy matters more than her feelings.", "NTA. You're trying to prevent another allergic reaction, and your sister seems like she doesn't want to be blamed for the problem you went through. Not wanting to go back due to the possibility of latex particles around the place is you looking out for yourself.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, I don't think your sister meant to trigger your allergy, and I at least learned in this AITA post that someone wearing latex previously giving a clothed hug could cause a life-threatening allergy. I'm sorry you are dealing with that.\n\nI do think it would be wise to work something out with your sister -- and, in general, living in the world where latex is used in a huge number of settings -- versus just \"never touch her\" or never go over to her house. Have you talked to an allergist about any options for your allergy? Have you talked with your sister about making sure the latex clothing stays in a sealed container in a certain part of the house you never visit, or confining any latex shooting or wearing to a certain area? Does showering fully first after the latex make a difference? Perhaps there are options, but of course your safety and well-being come first.", "**NTA** \\- I think you might have a touch of PTSD (I would).  But first things first\n\n1. Talk to your doctor\n2. Get an epi pen\n3. Keep it on you\n4. Be sure your husband and family know how to use it.\n\nAfter you talk to your doctor about your experience, the likely trigger, preventative measures, and like future outcomes, you may feel safe enough to visit your sister at a later time.", "Is latex like\u2026her thing? She\u2019d rather continue wearing latex and modeling in her home than have you come over or be able to touch you?", "NTA: your sister needs to get over herself and you need to do what you have to to make sure you don\u2019t die. If she wants to sulk let her and if SHE wants to project her guilt by making you feel bad about doing what\u2019s best for your health that\u2019s her business. Keep away until she\u2019s done with this job then you can see her when it\u2019s safe to do so. This is one of those situations where I\u2019m pretty sure your near death experience overrides her petty feelings", "NTA. Have you told her you're scared? This shit is scary.", "NTA - Your health and ensuring no more episodes is a priority. Why do you not travel with two epi sets (4 applicators)? Your focus is on your sisters house but you can react various environments.", "NTA - You have a life threatening allergy.  Reasonable boundaries are totally acceptable.  I'd reiterate that it isn't that you are blaming her, but that you need to protect yourself going forward.  If she can't accept that, I see that as her problem, not yours.", "NTA. In dealing with my own medical stuff I\u2019ve learned that you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s ability to understand or care about the severity of something. I used to think if I just explained the right way people would \u201cget it\u201d and when people didn\u2019t get it, I would play fast and loose with my own health rather than hurt somebody\u2019s feelings. No more. I realized it\u2019s a them problem not a me problem.\n\nYou have a life threatening allergy. Your sister can understand or not understand. At the end of the day you have to make choices that will keep you safe. It sucks if she doesn\u2019t get it but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.", "NTA. \n\nWhether she perceives it as crappy or not, you're simply looking out for your health.", "NTA. Your allergy reaction could have also been worsened by a cross reaction with food. There's many foods that trigger a Latex allergy. Since you've had such a serious reaction to latex definitely look up the food triggers and keep those in mind. Both myself and my daughter have been increasingly been getting worse food reactions along with our latex reactions.", "NTA. Carry an epi-pen with you if it's that severe. Latex might sneak up on you someplace.", "NTA. You have a completely vaild reason", "Look, you're NTA\n\nFrom the way you've described it in your post, your sister doesn't necessarily have a latex fetish where she *always* or *regularly* wears latex and this one time (or one of few times) that she wore it for a photo shoot for her side gig.\n\nFor that reason, IMO you've gone about this the wrong way.  You could have just said to her that you're allergic to latex and that next time you come over to warn you that she's been wearing latex that day or previous day so you can decide either not to go over or to be more careful.  Otherwise you're going to have to ban her from coming over to your place as well.", " doesn\u2019t your sister know you\u2019re allergic to latex and that if wearing latex suits might cause you an allergic reaction and wouldn\u2019t she think after wearing that she should take a shower or something.", "NTA\nYour sister doesn\u2019t make sense. Blames you for not taking your allergy earlier?  \n\nIt\u2019s not a complete sentence but whatever you meant, taking allergy pill earlier NTA taking your allergies seriously earlier NTA\n\nIn no scenario, are you anything but nta", "NTA. Your sister needs to realize that the whole world is not about her.\n\nJust because she didn't actually do anything bad doesn't mean that you have to risk your health. She should be understanding that your allergy puts limits on things that you can do safely. \n\nIt is unreasonable to expecct her to change her life and avoid all Latex exposure and thus the only option left becomes you avoiding physical contact. Not out of anger or anything like that - just a plain medical necessity.", "YTA, you didn\u2019t tell your sister about your latex allergy and then after you have a reaction she could not have predicted you tell her you can\u2019t touch her or go to her house, not even giving her the chance to say she won\u2019t use latex in her home anymore?  And she could shower before seeing you?  You are overreacting by not even giving her an opportunity to do anything different.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Taking precautions so that it doesn't happen again is the first thing to do.

You are not demanding that your sister not wear latex clothing. You are advising her that because of your condition, it seems that you have to take extra precautions to not cause another incident. Maybe clarify with her that you are blaming the clothes and not her and to explain that if you ever want to visit, you'll both have to properly coordinate to prevent another potential exposure that could end in catastrophe.

While your sister had no way or knowing that she had too many latex particles on her skin, nor how serious your allergy has become, I would also be worried about \u201ccross contamination\u201d at her house too.

I knew someone who found pineapple made their mouth itchy and sore. They then went to the hospital where something caused the staff to realize she was allergic to latex.

That's when she was told pineapples contain a form of latex.\n\nNTA, having an allergy has an initial steep learning curve.", "NTA.  Life threatening allergy trumps hurt feefees every single time", "Sounds reasonable you cant go over to her home considering your deathly allergic to something she uses regularly.

But at the same time, your sister can\u2019t be faulted for thinking that you\u2019re blaming her, since those are rather severe restrictions. Depending on how stressed you were when you spoke to her, your tone may have inadvertently given tthe impression that you bear some unhappy feelings towards her. \n\nMaybe take some time to come to terms with what precautions you have to take to manage your allergy, and then talk to her a while later. Maybe you can compromise, such as asking her to shower before she comes over to meet you, etc.", "Nta. This can cause death. She should care", "PTSD? Absolutely not.", "ptsd can absolutely be caused by one time traumatic events that almost kill you", "Sure can! Almost died after being shot during a robbery, most definitely have ptsd from it.
