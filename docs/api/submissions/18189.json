Have you talked to an allergist about any options for your allergy? Have you talked with your sister about making sure the latex clothing stays in a sealed container in a certain part of the house you never visit, or confining any latex shooting or wearing to a certain area?

Or was that a one  off? If she doesn't normally wear latex then it seems like overkill to avoid seeing or touching her. I think you need to go over the procedures with her for keeping you safe, and I think you also need to get an epi pen because you never know when someone out in the world at large will have been near latex. Someone wearing latex could bump into you in the street etc. I'm going to say NAH, because I think you're understandably scared of it happening again, but I can also see why she might be upset at not being able to have you over anymore.", "NTA and I hope you know it.

Given the nearly fatal experience, that emotion is easy to forgive!\n\nBut that doesn't change the reality that latex is everywhere. \nThink of sandwich bars: most sandwich makers wear latex gloves. Will OP avoid all sandwich bars? If the particles got through their sister's clothes during 1 hug and OP is sensitive to that, will OP have to avoid anyone who has recently eaten a sandwich prepared by a sandwich maker wearing latex gloves?

Apart from updates about her work, she also shares about her chronic illnesses.

Op, your definitely n t a. At all. Give it a minute to calm down and reach out, and remind her again you don't blame her. Cause if i was her I'd hate myself for almost killing you, even if unintentional, and I'd assume by you not coming by you might too.

Of course she couldn\u2019t completely avoid it in the natural world, but where she\u2019s aware of the risk being higher, she makes the wise choice of avoiding that place. If she had gone to a sandwhich bar and this had happened, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d never return there again. It\u2019s not about never touching her sister again, it\u2019s about exercising precaution where necessary. From what I read OP is avoiding her sister until the job that involves latex is complete\u2014that\u2019s rational. Now if OP said I\u2019m never going to visit my sister again, then that\u2019s irrational. The sister shouldn\u2019t feel guilty because it was likely a genuine accident, but she shouldn\u2019t make OP feel bad either for taking drastic actions because had she died this might be the sister writing in saying \u201cI accidentally killed my sister, and the guilt is killing me inside\u201d. \n\nAs an RN I have seen people get major reactions from minimal contact to the allergen. Anaphylaxis is NO joke and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. It\u2019s like being allergic to nuts, you can avoid it everywhere but when you go to a restaurant you let it be known \u201cno nuts\u201d but there\u2019s still a chance of trace contact and that alone is enough to send your body into shock. It might seem extreme to avoid people knowingly, but it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s (short term) self preservation which in my opinion is appropriate given the context.", "Many states have actually made it illegal to use latex gloves in food service, specifically because of allergies to latex.

Maybe she can research using alternatives to latex. You also need to get education on how to best protect yourself. Until then avoiding her seems reasonable.", "Nta.

Maybe you know and were vague on purpose, or perhaps you're sweet and innocent. It sounds like your sister is a fetish model. \"At home photoshoots\" + latex clothing screams \"latex fetish model.\"  Despite being one of the more common fetishes, there's often a large amount of shame surrounding it. I suspect that could be a major part of why she's feeling so defensive against some judgement she's perceived you as having. She's probably being kinda sensitive because you're basically pointing out that her kink has negatively affected you, and because now you've kinda participated without consenting.

Also, I don\u2019t think your sister is an A H either. She should be able to do her side gig, but will have to acknowledge that you can\u2019t be around latex.

She was covered in your allergen and you almost died. Avoiding her home is just common sense.", "NTA. A simple hug almost killed you. It\u2019s just not a safe environment to be in", "Seriously, who covers themselves in someone's allergen and thinks \"Oh, no need to shower before they come over, no need to warn them and surely I can just hug them.\" Also how can you be upset someone doesn't want to risk a life threatening emergency again?1", "I caught that too. Sis might be assuming it's judgment based on whatever her hobby is, when in reality it's just op trying not to die.", "Oh my god it is so important that you still go to the hospital after using your epi pen. They don\u2019t stop your reaction, they just temporarily relax your muscles so you don\u2019t choke to death and keep your blood pressure from dropping like it\u2019s hot (again temporarily). \n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to use the second pen if it takes longer than 15-20min for an ambulance to get to you or for you to get to the ER! Hell, if you don\u2019t get some kind of relief in 5 min, stab the other thigh with your second pen because sometimes it could fail! The doses in an epipen won\u2019t kill you if you take them back to back.", "In severe reactions, you have 10 mins and you need another shot, so go to the ER for sure.", "It's sounds like neither OP or her sister knew the severity of OPs allergy. (I get that repeated exposure makes it worse, but that doesn't mean that they knew it would escalate to this level).", "This is a NAH, verging on a Y-T-A.  Just for overkill.\n\nYou had, previously, an allergy that didn't much influence your life.  That has now changed, and the reason it changed is because of your sister.  It's 100% natural and sensible to want this scary life-threatening experience to never happen again.\n\nBut your sister had no way of knowing that this was going to happen because *you* didn't know it was going to happen.  There doesn't seem to have been malice (or even any more carelessness than you have admitted you yourself showed) on her part.  Lunging straight to \"I will never touch you again,\" without even considering the options of, \"You need to shower and scrub thoroughly between wearing latex and seeing me\" or \"Do you actually need to do latex modeling to make a living?\"  \n\nNow we don't know the lady.  Maybe she's an obnoxious latex fetishist and needs to wear the stuff all the time in order to be happy.  Maybe she's forgetful and won't remember to shower off.  Maybe she's actually trying to murder you.  But barring those, this is overkill.", "NTA - Given the fact you ended up in the hospital, telling your sister you can't touch her if she is doing the photoshoots is a reasonable reaction.  I don't get the jump from you being reasonable and wanting to prevent a repeat trip to the hospital and you blaming her for the reaction.  Also, is she serious with the take that you being careless is why you reacted?  That is just stupid.  It isn't her fault but it also isn't your fault.", ">I'm not mad, she had no idea that could do anything and I get that. But I told her that with my allergy more severe if she was doing that, I couldn't really go over her house or touch her anymore. \n\nI dont see you blaming her for anything in this post. I see a lot about  you taking precautions that involve her to make sure you stay safe, but nothing about her being at fault for this reaction.  NTA", "Did you know there's a big overlap of people who are allergic to latex and people who are allergic to bananas? Pay attention when you eat bananas in case you develop an allergy to those too\n\nNTA btw", "Every time you are exposed to an allergen the reaction likely gets worse.  The severity of the reaction would not lessen over time without immune suppression treatment as far as I know.  The amount of exposure to the allergen makes it worse certainly but I would expect the next reaction to be just as severe.  \n\n\nYou are NTA for looking out for your own health.", "NTA. Your sister's response might be coming from a place of guilt. You've had this allergy for years now and multiple allergic reactions and yet your sister forgot all of that. She probably feels bad, and her first response was to get defensive."]}
