My mom is not a huge animal person and my dad swore off getting close to any other animals after losing his beloved childhood dog.  I have always loved animals and would beg my parents for a pet for every birthday and holiday from the time i was 4 years old. The answer was always No, until I was 13, and the answer was finally yes. So long as I agreed to be the main caretaker. I obviously excitedly agreed and was then introduced to my new best friend, Theo. He was a schnauzer with the most beautiful little face you could ever imagine. I immediately loved him more than anything and we spent all of our time together. \n\nI walked him before and after school, fed him breakfast and dinner, gave him baths, and he slept in my bed with me every night. We\u2019ve never been a part longer than a week. He\u2019s been my best friend and honestly my baby. I love him so much it hurts. \n\nAbout a year ago I met my now bf at a bar and we hit it off immediately. He took to Theo instantly and loved him like his own. \n\nTheo got older and with that came new ailments and illnesses. Last week i noticed he was pooping blood so i rushed him to the emergency vet and they diagnosed him w/severe pancreatitis and he had to be admitted over night. When i picked him the vet said the next 24 hours would be critical. I stayed up all night making sure he was breathing. He was very lethargic all the next day. In the middle of the next night he woke up yelping. I rushed him back to the vet & he had a new infection & internal bleeding. They said they could do surgery but at his age the risk of him dying in the surgery was very high.\n\n I tried to call bf many times but he sleeps with his sound off so i got no answer. I called my dad and he picked up and i just burst into tears. My dad comforted me and told me to do what I thought was best but in his opinion Theo shouldn\u2019t live in pain and it would be better to be with him when he passed then let him die alone in surgery. I made the decision it was best for Theo to put him to sleep peacefully. It was the hardest thing i\u2019ve ever had to do. I held him the whole time. It was so fast. I immediately vomited when i got home. I laid on the floor with his toys and just sobbed until morning. \n\nMy bf rushed over when he woke up and saw my messages. He came in & said \u201cDid you really do it?\u201d i just nodded yes and he got angry. he started saying things like \u201chow could you do that to him?\u201d and \u201che trusted you\u201d. He thinks i should\u2019ve gotten a second opinion and tried the surgery. He says I abandoned him when he needed me most. I feel like I did too. I let my baby down and I took his life from him. He\u2019s also mad i didn\u2019t try harder to reach him.\n\nI don\u2019t know maybe I should\u2019ve waited but my baby was in pain and I just wasn\u2019t thinking about anything else. I miss Theo so much it hurts to breathe sometimes and I don\u2019t know if i did the wrong thing.

At 29 years old you should be able to see this behavior for what it is.\n\nWhen people tell you who they are, listen.", "Honey, you'r dog was 17 and in \u00e0 lot of pain. You made the right choice. Keeping him alive would have been selfish.\nNTA and dump your idiot boyfriend.", "NTA - You made the right call and ended his suffering. I'm sorry you lost your dog. That's hard.", "NTA. This is the hardest decision any pet owner has to make regarding their pet and there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d answer. Dogs are remarkable at hiding pain, so it\u2019s likely that he was suffering more than he let on. If you went through with the surgery, it likely would have only bought him a few months and that time wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been pleasant. He also might have died during surgery. \n\nIt sounds like you did the right thing by your long time best friend. He wouldn\u2019t want you beating yourself up over it. While your BF\u2019s response to you is not good at all, I can understand that he\u2019s grieving. But he owes you an apology and he needs to trust you with making the best decision regarding your dog. If he can\u2019t do that, there\u2019s no way you can have a future together with kids.", "NTA You made a tough decision but it sounds like a necessary one. It seems as though it would have just been prolonging his suffering to try the surgery. I'm sorry for your loss and sorry your bf is being so awful to you about it.", "NTA As someone who has watched many people keep their sick pets alive for years even though they could barely move you did the right thing. I had to let go of my cancer ridden best fur friend a few years ago even though he probably could have lived longer I couldn't stand to see him suffer just so I could keep him around, seemed so cruel. Sorry for your loss!", "NTA. Your dog had 16 wonderful years with you. Either he lived and died in pain, or you try the surgery and he goes through all of it possibly for nothing. \n\nYou did the best you could do for Theo, and he knows it. \n\nThe BF on the other hand... wow. Insanely callous and cruel of him to be piling on the blame. Gross of him at a time when you need all the support you can get.", "NTA at all. You did everything you could for him, and he died in your arms after a long life well-lived. That's much better than him being put to sleep by strangers for an operation and just never waking up. No dog could ask for anything better. You did right by your buddy.", "NTA it\u2019s such a hard decision to make but you did what was best. It sounds like you have him an amazing life. I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through, losing a fur baby is so hard. Even more so when you are the one that has to make that decision.  I\u2019m sure your bf is hurt but he\u2019s wrong for making you feel bad.", "NTA. From one dog lover who's had to make that GUT-WRENCHING and SOUL-SHATTERING decision also, I can tell you it's SO HARD to think clearly when you're faced with making that impossible decision. The thoughts and guilt can be brutal. But, in the end, you did your best to try to figure out the best thing to do with the circumstances you had laid out before you. You did what you thought was right, best, and most humane for your sweet fur friend. And that cannot ever possibly make you an ahole. Just the fact  that you are worrying about whether you made the right decision shows that you're NTA. Because an hole wouldn't give a crap.", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss. Your bf is an AH.", "So sorry to hear about your loss... your NTA, if he had internal bleeding and all that, it's very unlikely he would have lived much longer, even with surgery. You did the right thing.\n\nNow for your boyfriend... he had to know that this day was eventually gonna come, and is/was in denial about that. Which is understandable in a way, but that gives him zero right to make you feel guilty like that. Seems like a really shitty thing to do.", "NTA.  You did the kind thing and made sure your dog didn't have to suffer anymore.  I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Oh no. It's one of the greatest kindnesses we afford to our pets, at the cost of our own happiness. What you did was selfless and out of love. You didn't put him down because his sickness was annoying you or because you had enough of taking care of him. You did it because keeping him alive would be very cruel. This wasn't ever your fault. It's just one of those crappy things in life that everyone with a pet has to deal with. It's a great unfairness in life that our pets don't live as long as we do, but it's an even greater unfairness to force life on someone or something who would genuinely be better off without it.\n\nYour boyfriend was way out of line, saying all this. Theo wasn't his dog and if keeping a suffering dog alive for his own gratification is the kind of man he is, I would recommend not getting a pet with him and rethinking this whole relationship, especially with how he's treating you while you're grieving.\n\nTheo had a very happy life with you. He knew you loved him and he loved you right back. It won't undo your hurt, but you will always be his extra favourite human. Dogs are very good at picking up on love and the love you have for him leapt off the screen. He also knew you wanted to help him and that you were on his side. What a lucky boy to have so much love.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nWe have a saying in vet med: \u201cbetter a week too soon than a moment too late.\u201d\n\nDogs live in the now. If now sucks, life sucks. If there\u2019s a good prognosis, we sometimes ask them to suffer through a bit. It makes no sense to prolong suffering with a poor prognosis. \n\nSadly, I\u2019ve seen far too many people who hold onto a pet too long and let them suffer. I consider it selfish but I do understand that most of us want to keep our pets around as long as possible. The truth though is that few pets just \u201cdie peacefully\u201d\u2014they die in pain, confusion, and distress when we do not intervene. \n\nWhen I had to put my last dog down, my husband was out of the country working and needed a few days to get home to say goodbye. At the time, my dog was not acute and I could afford to wait a bit but he and I agreed that if my dog (I\u2019d had him since long before meeting husband) became distressed or got worse, I\u2019d be euthing before he made it home.\n\nIt seems to me that your partner doesn\u2019t have a very realistic understanding of the situation. \n\nPancreatitis isn\u2019t a challenging dIsease to diagnose. No second opinion was necessary and the dog was in acute distress. \n\nYou did the right thing. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MZJXr0K9qjY", "Of course you're NTA. Your dog was suffering. It's hard to say goodbye in those circumstances, and I get why you're feeling guilty now, but you did the right thing.\n\nYour bf however is a piece of work. What an insensitive prick to talk to you this way. Even if he disagreed it was a) not his decision to make and b) incredibly offensive to talk to someone you supposedly love this way. Awful behaviour on his part.", "NTA. You made a choice while thinking on your pets behalf, that\u2019s all someone can ask for. If you had done the surgery and he had survived, there most likely would have been more problems down the road with more suffering involved.\n\nEdit: Typo", "NTA. Your BF is an AH and it's better to change him. The way he criticized you instead of helping you out while grieving is disgusting. That poor baby was already old and in severe pain. Your dog had to be put down. Im sure he's now in a pain free place thinking about his momma. What you did was right. Relieving him of pain was the best thing anyone would do. Please take time and take care of yourself.", "NTA \n\nPutting a beloved pet down is a very painful but very important decision. Ultimately, you did the right thing. It would have been unfair to Theo to let him continue to suffer. Do not let your boyfriend tell you otherwise.", "NTA. You saved him from suffering.", "NTA you did what's best for your dog. It sucks and is hard for everyone but his quality of life is important too. You shouldn't put him through more suffering just because it's hard to let him go.", "NTA ignore your bf you did what was best for theo, he would have likely died during surgery/at home shortly after anyway due to both age and internal bleeding. It sucks when you have to get rid of a pet, but you did what was best.", "NTA - but your boyfriend needs to calm the F down. It is so out of order of him to verbally attack you like that when you have just lost your best friend! Theo was your dog, and you did what was best for him. Your boyfriend sounds like a bit of an entitled dick to be honest.", "No. NTA.\n\nMy cat passed away a little over a week ago. She was 17. I've had her since before I was born. She had animal alzheimer's. She was in in lot of pain. She was dying and hurting. We made the decision to put her to sleep. She did pass away before my parents reached the vet. But no. Theo was hurting and as painful as it you did the right think. I'm not sure what you believe in but Theo is pain free over the rainbow bridge. You didn't do the wrong thing. Theo is no longer in pain. I'm so so sorry for your loss. My condolences and my best wishes for you ans for Theo in the afterlife.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your BF is being an incredibly cruel manipulative AH throwing that abuse back on you.\n\nHe was YOUR dog, and ultimately your decision for his best interest and quality of life. The vet literally advised the risk of his surgery due to his age and other conditions.\n\nVery sorry for your loss. You didn't arbitrarily put your dog to sleep, you followed the medical advise of his vet and not wanting to see your pupper in pain.\n\nAbsolutely pissed off on your behalf at your BF for making this harder on you than it already was. What an entitled selfish AH. It wasn't HIS decision.", "NTA.  You have to think of the quality of life for the animal. I am not sure of the breed of the dog you had, but 16ish years is up there regardless and if he was having multiple medical issues and was starting to be in pain you absolutely did the right thing.  It is always very hard to make that call but from the information here it sounds like you made the correct one.  Just remember that even with surgery you may have lost him and given that the animal was having added conditions there is no guarantee it would have been better even if he made it through that.  In the end surgery may have just prolonged his suffering behind a veil of hope by thinking it was just recovery from the surgery.  I feel like if the animal was 10 years younger and had a good chance at a long healthy life after recovering then the waters get much more murky on the decision, but all signs here say you did the right thing.", "100% NTA\n\nMy sister is a vet, and it kills her to see animals suffer because owners can\u2019t do the humane thing and help ease their pain.\n\nYour bf on the other hand is def an AH. And if someone did abandoning when it was needed most, it was him. Dick.", "NTA\nIt's such a tough decision to make. But it sounds like you've made the right one. Theo is no longer is any pain, running over the Rainbow Bridge", "OMG Your best friend was suffering! NTA", "NTA\nMy cat passed away a year ago due to lung cancer.  I tried the surgery and everything I could but it didn't work. He died and I wasn't there.\nYou did what was best for you dog, not yourself. At least when he passed you were with him. You held him to the end. I'm sure he appreciated that. But I'm very sorry for your loss. It isn't easy.", "NTA.\n\nA typical schnauzer has a life expectancy of 12-15 years.  It seems like you've had him for 16 years, so that's a pretty good life\n\nIf the vet says there's not much you can do and he's in a lot of pain, then it is right to put the pet down. Surgery can be incredibly expensive, may not have worked, would have put Theo in more pain, and given him at best only another year?\n\n(Personally I had our cat put to sleep 3 years ago, who was 17yo and in renal failure. I question it still, but it was the right thing to do.)\n\nIt is too easy for others to come along later and say you should have done more; it wasn't their call.\n\nTheo DID trust you to take care of him, and you did.\n\nEDIT to Add:  And you DID get a second opinion--your Dad, who lived with Theo a lot longer than your BF.", "NTA. Euthanasia is humane and there's nothing wrong with it. It sounds like you made the right call here for sure. Some people have this idea that life is so precious that we should cling on to it even if it's just suffering. Euthanasia advocates don't think of life this way though. Everyone's got an expiration date. Sometimes we can help things along a bit quicker to minimize suffering.\n\nMaybe it could be helpful for your BF to have some resources explaining why euthanasia is humane and why blindly and desperately clinging to life is not necessarily the moral high ground.", "In the nicest way possible, you didn\u2019t even need to make this post.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA one little bit. Idgaf what your boyfriend says, you were in a terrible awful position and he wasn\u2019t picking up and you had to make a really sad choice. \n\nAt the end of the day, you made the best choice. Ending your poor sweet dogs pain now rather than making him suffer through surgery after surgery just to extend his life a little longer. The hardest part is to know when to let go. My mum couldn\u2019t with our dog who was blind, deaf, couldn\u2019t walk, had arthritis and brain tumours. It wasn\u2019t until she didn\u2019t recognise my mum that she made the decision, and we all held her and loved her as she slipped away peacefully. You stayed with him so the last thing he saw was his best friend, full of love for him. Theo would thank you for not letting him be in pain, and he knows that you made the decision out of love for him. You didn\u2019t abandon him, you did the best for him. And that makes you the best person, doing what\u2019s best for him and not prolonging his life for your own selfish reasons. \n\nHopefully your bf will come around, and this was just a knee jerk reaction of upset of not being able to be there, but he needs to stop taking it out on you. You were told the surgery might not even save him, so he got to go peacefully, in a space filled with love for him and the person he\u2019s known most of his life.", "NTA at all. Seems like he was well cared for in his life and you had to make a tough decision. You made it for the right reasons.\n\nYour boyfriend is being unreasonable blaming you. Not only is it not what you need right now, but because of this bit:\n\n>When i picked him the vet said the next 24 hours would be critical. I stayed up all night making sure he was breathing. He was very lethargic all the next day. In the middle of the next night he woke up yelping.\n\nYour BF knew this was a critical time and left it to you to stay up with your dog both nights, leaving his phone on quiet. If he wanted to be kept up to date he should have had his volume on. He may have done it without thinking, but he still did. Your dog deserved not to be in pain any longer.", "Your bf is an AH. Unless this is typical, chalk it up to grief and guilt. IMHO you did the most loving thing for your dog - I'm in total agreement with your father. I hope your bf comes around. You had to make a horrible decision and he was spared that, so he can zip it. NTA!!", "I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nAnd NTA at all. Being the partner of an aging pet is hard. This poor dog was suffering, and putting him through surgery would have been risky... AND his quality of life after would probably have been awful.\n\nYou took the right decision. Your dog needed you to let him go and stop the suffering. I am glad you are not one of those pet owners that makes their pet suffer needlessly just so they can keep them around. When their time has come, the best thing you can do is let them go, not force them to suffer for your own enjoyment. \n\nStop doubting. You did the right thing and I am sure your dog would agree.", "NTA!!!  And I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  \n\nYou cared for him and he had a long life!  As his Mom, you get to decide what\u2019s best for him, and I agree with you that it was best to let him go when you did.", "NTA. You took great care of him from what it sounds and don't deserve to feel this way for helping end his pain. I'm so sorry you lost your buddy. It's horrible losing animals but time will help. \n\nRemember that you did you best and your best was actually great.", "NTA\n\nYou will always second guess yourself on the decision. That will always live with you but what you did was the right thing. Your pet had severe medical conditions that caused it pain. The baby was bleeding from the inside out and an operation might not have corrected it. All it would\u2019ve done was cause more suffering for the pet had it gone through with that surgery. Losing a pet is one of the hardest things you will go through so all you can do is do your best & you did by making that painful decision.", "Well dear I'm so sorry for the loss of your beloved Theo. And I'm sorry you should properly be morning him and not dealing with an obnoxious boyfriend. You were strong and brave and held your best friend to the end so that he was comforted and secure and went out knowing he was loved. No pets could ask for more. Your boyfriend is wrong and I know you don't want to hear this right now but it's time to lose about 150-160 lb of dead weight find someone who is a decent human being. Again so sorry for your very profound loss.", "NTA. You always know when the time is right. Your boyfriend is a special kind of sick to harangue you for this", "Definitely NTA. It's better to put him to sleep rather than letting him die with pain. I'm really sorry for your loss. And if possible, you might need to reconsider your relationship with your BF.

It's honestly a shame that we allow animals fo die with dignity but not humans.", "NTA. You did what you thought was best. No one deserves to suffer. On top of that, you can\u2019t explain to an animal that surgery might help, all they\u2019ll know is they\u2019re in an unfamiliar place and their people aren\u2019t around to comfort them.\n\nEveryone grieves differently, but you\u2019re not the AH here. Theo had a good life, and you let him get the rest he deserved.", "I\u2019m sorry you had to make this decision and I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is never easy. Imo you made the right decision though. Definitely NTA. Your bf should be ashamed of himself, putting you down rather than comforting you.", "NTA\n\nYou gave your best friend 16 years of love and care and affection. That's a lifetime in dog years. It's never an easy decision to make, but I think choosing his comfort and easing his pain over your own attachment and sadness was a very empathetic choice. He'll be waiting for you on the other side of the rainbow bridge with a wagging tail and lots of licks.", "A hundred percent NTA, you\u2019re boyfriend this is an asshole for sure. Instead of supporting you through this difficult time, he thought it best to scold and yell at you. SMH", "NTA- I'm so sorry for your loss. I know the pain of losing a beloved pet. You did nothing wrong. I assure you, promise you, cross my heart, you did the very best for your Theo. Your boyfriend is right in saying that your dog trusted you but he's wrong in saying that you failed that trust. You did not fail that trust by letting him go, you honored that trust by letting him go peacefully and not suffering. The hardest thing we have to do is let those we love the most go for their own sake and not make them stay for ours. You did not let Theo down. Even if he had lived through surgery the quality of life after was very marginal and there was no reason to let your beloved pet suffer.  You did the very best that you could. You provided him a loving home, good food, tons of love, a warm bed, toys, treats, and happiness. You gave him everything you could and as all good dogs do they burrow into our hearts and then leave us way too soon.  I swear to you that you did not do the wrong thing. I know how you are feeling. I have been there. It's hell on earth and you feel like the hole they left in your heart is going to swallow you alive along with the guilt that you didn't do enough. But you did exactly the right thing and gave your dog the best gift, you took away his suffering and gave him peace and you stayed with him right to the end.  That meant more to him than anything. You were his loving person until the very end.  \n\nNow, go kick your boyfriend in the shins and tell him to shut up.", "NTA but reevaluate your relationship, when we lost our kitty in an accident and had to put him down my bf just held me. No blame.", "You are not TA, not even remotely close in any universe. Your bf though\u2026 how totally unsupportive and mean!

At least I would never be able to. \nYou are NTA but your bf is\u2026 unforgivable", "NTA, You did what was best and you loved him as long as you could. It sucks and you bf does not sound very helpful. Theo was 16 that's a really good run for a pup.", "NTA at all. Sometimes the kindest thing we can do for our pets is to let them go. I so sorry because I know how difficult that decision is, even when you know it is the right one, and you should have had your bf's support. I don't think a lot of him for treating you like this.", "NTA\n\nAs a person that put quite a few pets to sleep. Would you feel better to watch Theo dying slowly? Being in pain and crying daily? Unable to eat, hold food or stay awake? Or not even having time to say goodbye and just losing him? \n\nI don't think so. You want to give them the best. And the best is a good healthy life and knowing when they can no longer be alive. Understanding that they can't be alive forever and that it's good to have respect for the end of circle of life. That it's better to hold him, cry, tell him you love him a lot and put him to sleep. Than spend agonizing months and day for you and him when he won't be able to eat and watch him die slowly. The dog trusted you to offer him the best you could. And that is what you did. You didn't let him down. You took care of him. You cared enough for him to understand that he was hurting and that this was the best thing you could do to take him out of pain. You didn't take his life out of him. He was sick and he would die sooner than you think. Instead you decided to not let him die in pain and agony. How is that a bad thing for your boyfriend?", "NTA.\n\nI've had dogs my whole life and I'm a dog groomer, they are literally my life. You did what was best for your dog. Prolonging a life with suffering isn't providing life and isn't in the best interest and comfort of the animal, it's done so the human doesn't have to deal with the loss. \n\nI've always considered it a duty to let your animal die with dignity and not make them suffer for my needs. Your boy was 16 (based on the ages you gave) and that's a long and wonderful life for a dog. You didn't abandon him and you didn't let him down, I can promise you that.\n\nI'm really sorry for your loss and what you're going through.", "NTA. Responsible pet ownership is so hard when end of life decisions need to be made. You made the compassionate choice to end suffering. Hugs and healing to you.", "NTA. \n\nMy parents rescued a greyhound (we already had another dog)when I was 13 and she and I immediately clicked.

Even when I was at school she refused to sleep anywhere besides my bed. She was at the point where she couldn\u2019t stand, was taking enough painkillers to take down a rhino and would just cry while she was laying on the couch. Vet said they could do a few surgical things to alleviate the swelling in her joints and make her more comfortable but she was 16 so my family decided it would be easier for her to let her go. Hardest day of my life up to that point so I get exactly what you went through, and I think you did the right thing. She never licked faces, I was the only one she ever did it to and it probably happened 5 times total, but she sat in my lap the entire drive to the vet licking my face as if she knew and then put her paw in my lap and kept it there as she slipped away. I think your dog went more peacefully with you there. We don\u2019t deserve dogs", "So sorry for your loss.  But, if your vet was willing to help Theo, then it was not a wrong decision.\n\nOn the passing of our beloved lab, we received a note from the vet telling us that we not only did the right thing, we did the \"kind\" thing to ease his suffering.  I will never regret our decision - we owed him too much for all the love and devotion he had given us.\n\nI am sure your boyfriend is mostly upset that he couldn't be there, too.  Give him time to grieve alongside you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, this is something worth considering ending the  relationship over\n\nYou did right by that dog.  At some point, it's cruel to keep animals alive just so we don't have to face the pain of losing them for another day", "Absolutely NTA. It's the hardest thing we have to do as pet parents, making the decision when to put them to sleep. That's the cost for all the love and light they bring to our lives. You knew Theo better than anyone-he loved you and he trusted you, and he knew you would look after him. And you did-you allowed him to pass gently in the arms of his person, and he would have known and understood how much you loved him in that moment. You didn't abandon him, you didn't let him down, you did exactly what we all should do, what is best for our pets, not what is best for us. Your boyfriend is absolutely, completely and utterly wrong about this. I hope he wises up and apologises, because what he said was appalling and deliberately hurtful.", "NTA\n\nAnd I know how hard this is. A couple of years ago, we had to put our beautiful Lab, Onyx, to sleep. He was very sick with an aggressive cancer that was going through the roof of his mouth. It was either keep him on painkillers amd watch him starve to death or let him go. \n\nAnd it's heart breaking when your pet is so extremely sick and clearly suffering. It can be hard to know that you're doing the right thing. \n\nBut in the end, it's selfish to let them live in pain and suffering, especially when there's so little hope of the treatment working. \n\nYou did what was best for Theo. You let him go. He isn't suffering anymore. \n\nAnd the bf is a jerk for making you feel bad about it.", "To pets, we are their whole world, and you gave Theo a wonderful life. Unfortunately, those lives don't last as long as ours, and it's our curse & responsibility to send them off when the time comes. For Theo, it was time, and you showed him the last kindness by ending his suffering. **NTA**", "Nta\nIm crying rn too", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry your boyfriend reacted so unfairly (I\u2019d even say abusively). You made an incredibly difficult decision in the best interest of Theo and his quality of life. More importantly, you stayed with him through the very end, which is incredibly difficult - a lot of pet owners aren\u2019t able to step up like that. By sparing Theo from unnecessary surgery and bouncing around emergency vets you gave him the opportunity to die peacefully wrapped in your loved.", "NTA. You poor thing \u2764\ufe0f you made the right decision and I\u2019m so sorry. Losing a pet is so hard. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about it.", "My gf was literally in this same position just last week. Her dog was getting up there in age and he couodnt control his blatter so hed pee and poop while walking without noticing. And her mom would yell at him for doing it. She knew he couldnt control it   and when he would fall down the stairs and you would try and help him up he would pee then too. She made the decision to put him down as he could hardly stand while eating, if he chose to eat that day. Her mom has been giving her the cold shoulder everyday since. And what hurt my gf the most was the second we got back from putting him down her sister was already asking when are we throwing out his things. They practically are trying to get rid of any memory of her dog without even letting her process that he is gone. Her sister wanted to take all his toys and drop it off at the dog park. Never thought id meet someone so cold towards their own family knowing how upset theyd be if it were to happen to their own dog", "NTA.\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. \nPart of our responsibility as pet owners is being able to make this decision for them. \nTheo was 17. If he made it through surgery, recovery would have been difficult and painful for him, and he wouldn\u2019t have understood why. \n\nInstead, all Theo knew in his last moments of life was what he had known all of his life, your love.\n\nYou did right by him.", "NTA. There's a point in a pet's prognosis where you'd just be prolonging misery for the pet, and it's your responsibility as owner to recognize when that is. It is very painful to make the decision for a beloved pet. \n\nYour boyfriend is being really awful. He's both wrong and mean, not a good combo.", "Nta, you made the right call. Your boyfriend just showed his maturity though, and it ain't good.", "Your BF is a garbage person for what he's said. NTA in any sense, I'm sorry he's being like that in your time of grief", "I have a Grandfather that grew up on a farm.  He had no illusions about the nature of animal's lives.  They had cattle, they ate meat, it's just life.  He loved animals still and as an adult he had a dog as a pet.  When the dog got old and sick he resisted putting it to sleep and wanted to dog to die at home naturally with family.  It was horrible.  The dog suffered, the people suffered.\n\nAfter that experience he said he would never do that again and later pets they had were put to sleep when the time came. He felt terrible about the experience and would tell you as much.\n\nThe fact that he went through that and made the wrong choice makes me feel better about having to make that choice myself when the time comes.  He already tried the \"Hold onto the dog as long as possible route,\" and it's horrible.\n\nDon't feel bad about putting him to sleep, the alternative is awful.", "My dog was put to sleep when there was nothing else to do, because we chose the surgery before. Yes, It's heartbreaking ; yes, at that moment you hate yourself for taking that decision.\n\nBut let me tell you this : I have had 6 years to think about it, and when I look back at how old, in pain and unresponsive he was, I know it was the right decision. And doing the surgery the first time was the wrong one : my dog wasn't a dog anymore. He wasn't eating or walking, he just layed from a place to another. He was blind and deaf at the end of his life.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to process this, but I hope he will finally understand that this wasn't only necessary, but there was no other way, surgery will have turned your dog into something, but it would not have save your pet. It would have given you a carpet that happened to be breathing. \n\nYou took the right choice.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you did the right thing.

My dad said only if I was the one to take care of it. And I did til we put her to rest at 14. She had been in kidney failure and we were giving her IVs and she wasn\u2019t herself. \n\nThen all of a sudden\u2026 she miraculously got better\u2026 for like a week tops. Then was worse than before. I was distraught no one was doing anything, got her in my car, and took her to the vets who said it was over. Sure, they could try different things. But it was gonna cost a lot of money and be like a band aid on a gunshot. So finally, I broke down and did it.

You were able to say goodbye and get closure. If your dog had surgery and didn't survive, you would've beat yourself up about it. 14 is very old for any dog.

My mom is not a huge animal person and my dad swore off getting close to any other animals after losing his beloved childhood dog.  I have always loved animals and would beg my parents for a pet for every birthday and holiday from the time i was 4 years old. The answer was always No, until I was 13, and the answer was finally yes. So long as I agreed to be the main caretaker. I obviously excitedly agreed and was then introduced to my new best friend, Theo. He was a schnauzer with the most beautiful little face you could ever imagine. I immediately loved him more than anything and we spent all of our time together. \n\nI walked him before and after school, fed him breakfast and dinner, gave him baths, and he slept in my bed with me every night. We\u2019ve never been a part longer than a week. He\u2019s been my best friend and honestly my baby. I love him so much it hurts. \n\nAbout a year ago I met my now bf at a bar and we hit it off immediately. He took to Theo instantly and loved him like his own. \n\nTheo got older and with that came new ailments and illnesses. Last week i noticed he was pooping blood so i rushed him to the emergency vet and they diagnosed him w/severe pancreatitis and he had to be admitted over night. When i picked him the vet said the next 24 hours would be critical. I stayed up all night making sure he was breathing. He was very lethargic all the next day. In the middle of the next night he woke up yelping. I rushed him back to the vet & he had a new infection & internal bleeding. They said they could do surgery but at his age the risk of him dying in the surgery was very high.\n\n I tried to call bf many times but he sleeps with his sound off so i got no answer. I called my dad and he picked up and i just burst into tears. My dad comforted me and told me to do what I thought was best but in his opinion Theo shouldn\u2019t live in pain and it would be better to be with him when he passed then let him die alone in surgery. I made the decision it was best for Theo to put him to sleep peacefully. It was the hardest thing i\u2019ve ever had to do. I held him the whole time. It was so fast. I immediately vomited when i got home. I laid on the floor with his toys and just sobbed until morning. \n\nMy bf rushed over when he woke up and saw my messages. He came in & said \u201cDid you really do it?\u201d i just nodded yes and he got angry. he started saying things like \u201chow could you do that to him?\u201d and \u201che trusted you\u201d. He thinks i should\u2019ve gotten a second opinion and tried the surgery. He says I abandoned him when he needed me most. I feel like I did too. I let my baby down and I took his life from him. He\u2019s also mad i didn\u2019t try harder to reach him.\n\nI don\u2019t know maybe I should\u2019ve waited but my baby was in pain and I just wasn\u2019t thinking about anything else. I miss Theo so much it hurts to breathe sometimes and I don\u2019t know if i did the wrong thing. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP did a very hard thing so a beloved pet wouldn\u2019t suffer. BF doing performative righteousness needs to get in the fucking bin.", "NTA\n\nThe toughest decision a pet owner has to make is when is it time. Having just done that myself with my 18 year old cat, I know your pain.\n\nYou did the right thing by thinking of your best friend Theo and what was better for him than you. He crossed the rainbow bridge knowing he was loved and had a great life and would no longer be in pain or suffering.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You had a loved one who was suffering and you chose the most humane path. Being there with them at the end is the best thing you can do. He got to be with you to the end.", "Losing your furry loved ones is hard. You did the right thing, though. He was in pain and he might not have made it through surgery. Your bf is upset and blaming you because he has no one else to blame. This is a red flag. You did the right thing. Grieve as you must then consider your boyfriends reaction. NTA", "You are NTA. Your boyfriend should be supporting you, he knew your dog for 1 year and you knew him for 16. He should be concerned about how hard this must be for you, but he\u2019s not, and he\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty with the things he\u2019s saying to you, which is a little bit disgusting honestly, even if he is grieving. Your dog was suffering and that is more important than your boyfriends feelings.", "NTA and having been in this situation, it\u2019s not an easy decision.  The decision you made was to ease Theo\u2019s suffering at the sake of your own.  During the time it would have taken to get a second opinion, surgery and recovery (if he came through) Theo would have been in pain.\n\nYou took on his suffering by easing his pain and inflicting your own.  Believe me when I say that this was incredibly brave and loving.  It\u2019s a decision of \u201cwell what if he would have gotten better.\u201d  But he wouldn\u2019t have.  \n\nHowever, your bf needs to check himself.  He should have been supportive and caring rather than judgmental. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss.  You never get over the feeling of loss and missing your loved one.  But the pain will turn to fond memories with a hint of longing.", "I've been in your position, more than once.  The first two times, we opted for treatment, including once for an elderly dog like yours. Maybe it was the right decision for Cody, who was relatively young and otherwise healthy.  But I didn't get to say goodbye to her, and I will never stop second-guessing making her last moments ones surrounded by strangers.\n\nBut it was the wrong decision to make Sammy, my old lady dog, go through treatment -- it was a decision FOR OUR BENEFIT, not hers.  Ultimately, we did euthanize her, and got to be with her and hold her and tell her it was time for her to rest.  \n\nHaving gone through those situations with Cody and Sam, when we faced an emergency decision for Sarah, with an unknown mass bleeding, we decided to euthanize and my husband was with her so she had someone who loved her at the end.  THAT was the decision made for HER benefit.\n\nI am so sorry for the loss of your Best Dog Ever.  I am glad you were able to make a decision for HIS comfort.  The next while is going to be hard.  Even after a lot of time has passed, you are going to find yourself suddenly sobbing.  Grief means you loved, and were loved, so cherish that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Your bf on the other hand should not take his grief out on you in this situation where you need confirmation you did the right thing (that is what this post is for).  He should learn from this that he should keep his phone on in case of emergencies so that he is available to help; not appear after the fact when the difficult part is over.  It is always easy to criticise someone else's decision.", "NTA. I just had to take my cat to the emergency vet on Friday. I suspected it was his kidneys because he has chronic kidney disease and the symptoms were consistent with that progressing. Now, he wasn\u2019t in too bad of shape, so I expected they\u2019d be able to treat him and he\u2019d come home. But I knew there was a small chance he wouldn\u2019t. I love him very much, and the thought of losing him is extremely upsetting. But if the vet had told me he would be in pain and treatment would only be prolonging the inevitable, I would have agreed to put him to sleep without hesitation, because while the thought of him being gone is heartbreaking, him suffering would be even worse. You absolutely made the right decision, and your boyfriend is being a selfish asshole for talking to you like that. I\u2019d give him a little time to come around, perhaps he\u2019ll see the light once the shock wears off. But if he continues to question you on this, I don\u2019t see how this relationship is worth saving.", "NTA.  My family has a 16 year old cairn terrier that has been a part of my life for my entire adulthood, basically.  We are constantly monitoring her to make sure she's still happy and has a good quality of life.  We had to put her sister down in April, and it was very hard, even after her long, slow decline.  You do the best you can for them with the information you have.  You DID the best you could for your buddy with the information you had.  Your boyfriend is being a jerk.  It's ok for him to be upset he didn't get to say goodbye, but there is no excuse for him treating you like this.", "so NTA. it's been less than a week since I had to put my dog down. so i understand how you're feeling right now. you did what was best and most humane thing for Theo. and anyone who has never had to be in that situation doesn't get to voice their opinion.", "NTA. I'm so sorry, Theo was lucky to have you.\nAlso, your bf of 1 YEAR is an absolute excuse of a human being. Who says these things to a grieving partner?", "NTA whatsoever.  Your bf clearly doesn't know much about pets or caring for another living creature, thinking that a surgery would have been the miraculous cure-all and it was a simple decision.....  It's not that simple.  Surgery on a dog that age is hard on the dog, recovery is difficult and painful, and for what?  Another 6 months of a painful life?  Or skip surgery and let them keep suffering until they die naturally at home?  No.  The only thing your bf was right about was that Theo trusted you.  He did, and you took great care of him.  You did right by your baby, and I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.", "NTA and I'm really sorry for your loss. My pets are my life, and I'm dreading the day I have to do this. You did the right thing. The vet wouldn't have recommended putting him down if he didn't think it was time. Your pup would have unnecessarily suffered. Your boyfriend however is a total ass for making it seem like it's your fault he wouldn't answer his phone and making you feel guilty for everything.", "NTA you did the best thing for him", "NTA, your dad was right. It's a hard thing to make that choice, and you'll always wonder whether it was the right one. But Theo was in pain, and the surgery would have been added pain that, as the vet stated, likely wouldn't make a difference. Theo had a good life, and you took care of him until the end. I think it's good you let him go out peacefully, rather than risk the surgery.", "No. NTA. When we have pets, we have to give them the dignity and peace to pass as painlessly as possible.  You did him a kindness. I fully understand the feeling. I had to have my girl PTS last year. My heart still hurts.", "I am so sorry for your loss. You did the right thing to prioritize Theo and his comfort. He wouldn\u2019t have understood that surgery was extending his life or that you were \u201cfighting\u201d for him- just that he was still in pain. \n\nI\u2019m hoping your boyfriend was reacting out of sadness, but if he doesn\u2019t shape up fast, that\u2019s a concern. My wife and I very abruptly had to put down a cat because of a sudden, unpredictable medical issue; she had been my first cat. However, my wife brought her into the relationship and had her three years before we were together. I backed the hell up and gave my wife room to make the big choices (unless she asked for input) and to be the primary grief holder during the ordeal. \n\nHis lashing out isn\u2019t okay. You did everything right. I\u2019m sure my Fern, that cat I mentioned who taught me how to love a cat, will go check out Theo for us.

Theo was unwell, and and pain. Now he's not.\n\nYour bf? He's the AH here. This was his reaction after you lost the family member you've known for over half of your life?! Fuck that guy.", "NTA that sweet dog of yours was old and the trauma of having surgery at the grand old age he was it wasn\u2019t worth the risk and pain for the poor thing.\n\nI\u2019ve had dogs all my life and the hardest decision you have to make is when it\u2019s time. It\u2019s not easy to make the choice but ultimately you make it and you take on the pain of losing them to give them the freedom of no more pain.\n\nYour bf was out of order I can only hope it was grief.", "NTA, is this your bfs first pet? It feels like a reaction that comes from someone who hasn't had pets before and has only experienced having a pet for a year.\n\nAs the person who's been with Theo his whole life you know him better. You know how much his health had declined and have a better perspective on it than someone who basically just met the dog. \n\nYou did the right thing, and you did the most that you could for a senior doggy. It's easy to second guess yourself, I do it occasionally after we had to put our 15 yo golden to sleep a couple months ago. It's just because you want him back, but behind that we know that even if we had poured money into him he'd still be in pain and still be a dog that gave us more years than we could have hoped for.\n\nTake it easy, your boyfriend likely just doesn't understand this and is upset at himself for not being there and upset over the loss as well.", "NTA. This is the most difficult decision someone that has a pet can take. When is the right time? It's difficult to say but, and I also apply it for humans, when the pain is beyond hope and the odds are against him, it's a good call.\n\nYou dogs trusted you, and you made the right call. And you were with him at the end. This is all. \n\nYou did good.", "NTA - I understand why your boyfriend is upset, because he also loved Theo and didn't get to say goodbye.  Grief makes us do and say irrational things.  He's being irrational and lashing out in pain.  \n\nWhat caused me to say NTA instead of N A H is that he lashed out *at you* while you were also in grief.   He took his grief out on you despite the fact that you're also suffering. Despite the fact that Theo was yours, not his.  Instead of being there for you and leaning on each other, he became a source of further torment.  \n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you.  I know how it feels.  I know how there are very few words that could possibly make it better.  I hope you can take comfort in the fact that you gave Theo as best of a life as you could.  He was loved and cared for.  You made the right decision.  Because of you, Theo left this world surrounded by love.

She was with us for a few more years but her life was very restricted as per vets instructions and it was like she had no energy.\n\nBut apparently my Dad looked at us (we were all at the vets) and couldn't do it.

That was the most helpful thing he could have said.", "Yep. 2 nights of critical watch and he has his phone on silent.\n\nAnd that's her fault, apparently.", "I'm sorry you had to go through all of that.

If your boyfriend is truly grieving, that's a shame, and he will need time to get over it, but that does not include you taking the blame for anything. It's interesting that he's grieving so hard, but doesn't seem to acknowledge your grief, and you knew the dog much longer than he did. So do what you need to protect your own feelings from him.\nA little aside here: when my cat died 4 years ago, it was from an illness that no one saw coming, and we only had a few days between that and her passing. What got me through was writing letters to her. If that sounds like something you would be comfortable with, it can be incredibly helpful. Just pour it out on the page. At the beginning, I was writing several letters a day to her, and then gradually (a month or two later) it tapered off. The last time, I was surprised to see that it had been 6 months since the previous letter. So time does heal.

I could have kept him alive for weeks more but he was in pain and only slept. I let him get the shot and was with him til the end.

I absolutely know Theo didn't feel any pain during the transition, maybe even felt better than he has for months, and he got to spend it with the love of his life: you. You made the right call, however much it hurts. I firmly believe that Theo is looking for the next Good Boy (or Good Girl) to guild to you right now- he will always be looking out for you.\n\nHowever, and I hate to mix comfort with judgment, look at your boyfriend and think if this is the behavior you want to have beside you when times are rough. A child has a better grasp of understanding and sympathy while grieving than this whole grown man. Yes, he's grieving, but throwing insults and hatred at you is not a reasonable way to cope.", "NTA. You did the right thing. I know it was incredibly difficult, but it was the most loving thing you could do for him. Theo would thank you if he could. \n\nMy condolences to you.", "Nta. And as a zoologist, this was the right call. \n\nLet me put this into context here: animals tend to live much more in the moment than humans ever do. A human going through severe illness and injury and pain has the ability to think of the future and plan for days when it is all over. Hope is a key part of this and can emotionally sustain us through very hard times.\n\nYour Theo didn't have this emotional depth. He would have just known that he felt terrible and was in agony. There would have been no planning or hope because he is not built to understand things like that. I don't mean he had no emotional capacity at all, dogs love pretty strongly, just no emotional capacity for hope. He would not understand where you had gone while he was scared and in pain. He would not understand that these strangers were trying to help and he would not understand treatment plans or recovery times. He could only live in that moment, and those moments were no longer good. But his last moment, the one that really mattered, all he would have known is the pain was gone, he was warm and sleepy and in the arms of the creature he loved the most. \n\nNo vet is going to recommend putting a beloved pet to sleep for the hell of it. It's not a nice job. But they understand that sometimes it is the only fair thing rather then dragging out illness and agony in an elderly pet. It's not like they said he would likely survive and recover fully, this was going to be an absolute last ditch attempt and most likely would fail. You made the best call and yes it hurts like hell but surely you would rather have this pain on you then leaving Theo to deal with it. Do not feel guilty or think you could have done more. Your boyfriend is wrong and clearly needs to realize the difference between not operating on an old dog and not operating on an old human. It is not the same. \n\nI would also advise reevaluating someone who sees you in a mess like that and reacts that way. But that's a side note.", "I think you did the right thing. Animals don\u2019t understand pain the way humans do - they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to them or why. Your dog was suffering and had a poor prognosis.

Also by the looks of it your BF seems the type who\u2019s would get upset for you for trying to peacefully sleeping your dog without any pain than rather to see your dog be in pain while doing the surgery.

My parents took him to be put down on a Monday morning (I couldn't go with despite wanting to be there for him because I knew I'd go into hysterics) and the entirety of Sunday night I hardly slept a wink. We spent the night on the couch together watching TV and I woke up to him smashed up against my legs the way he always was when we cuddled. God it was awful. After he left I didn't speak for hours; I just sorta stared at my laptop trying to read and distract myself but I wasn't comprehending a thing.

People that have never had to go through that or make those kind of decisions will never understand. And some of the ones that will let their pet go through something like that especially when it's incredibly debilitating will never understand what it's like to prioritize someone else's suffering over their emotions. It can be a moral gray area, it can also rip your heart out, and some people will judge you for it.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave Theo the final, greatest gift you could give; a peaceful death in the arms of the person he loved.\n\nYou faced the hard decision square on and you made it out of love.

My dog died alone in a kennel at the emergency vet and all I had to show for it was a $4k vet bill and didn\u2019t get to comfort my beloved in her final moments. It is one of my biggest regrets that we didn\u2019t end her suffering, and that I wasn\u2019t there for her when she needed me most. She must have been so scared and wondering where I was, I still cry about it 6 years later. Theo was already a senior, and would have passed years earlier from old age if he hadn\u2019t been cared for. He lived exactly how long he was supposed to. Your BF is probably heartbroken he wasn\u2019t there for Theo, but he is dead wrong in what he said. You did the opposite of abandoning him or letting him down. You made sure to see him off, you ended his pain, and you advocated for him when he didn\u2019t have a voice of his own. You made a selfless choice that brought you pain and heartache, all for him. To bring him peace. Dogs don\u2019t fear death, and Theo was absolutely ready to go. I cannot say it enough, you did the right thing and Theo would never be upset knowing that you released him from his suffering.", "NTA OP.

I'll be absolutely heartbroken when it's her time, but I refuse to be one of those people who keeps her around and suffering for my own selfish needs.

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.\n\nAll the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.\n\nThey all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.\n\nYou have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.\n\nThen you cross Rainbow Bridge together....\"\n\nI'm not religious, and I don't know if you are, but I hope it brings you some comfort. I know it did for me.", "NTA.  It's never, never, never wrong to humanely end an animal's suffering.  Sooner is better than later.\n\nYour boyfriend is an asshole for selfishly wanting your dog to live in pain, and for guilt-tripping you for doing the right thing for your dog.  The poor creature was ancient, he was never going to recover from any surgery.  I feel sorry for any pets your boyfriend may have in the future.  If they get old or get sick and are suffering he's going to force them to live no matter how miserable they are.", "God, I'm crying just reading that.

But he\u2019s 17 and any surgery is not advised, you didn\u2019t need a 2nd opinion, and your BF thinking you \u201cbetrayed\u201d him is an idiot and mean, especially if it isn\u2019t something he takes back right away.

I get he was close to theo but that doesn\u2019t give him a reason to be mad and yell. He chose not to be there for you or Theo.\n\nAnd you did get a second opinion, your dad.

You did what every good and loving pet parent would do: You gave him mercy and let him pass peacefully and with grace. In the end and with the clarity and higher understanding I believe death brings everyone, he was thankful and saw that at the biggest and best expression of your love and devotion to him.  \n\n\nWe had to say good-bye to our almost 20 year-old semi feral, brain-damaged, PTSD-having cat a few years ago. He was perfectly fine; eating, drinking, bouncing around like he'd been shot up with crack. The only issues you could see were he lost all his teeth and had arthritis that flared up in the cold. But, we had him put down three years ago today. Not even the vet staff could believe he was so old because he was so well cared for. He was happy (grumpiest old man ever), sweet (provided you gave him treats) and was the softest boy ever (fur like silk;   in the fur trade, he'd of been worth a small fortune if he wasn't a house cat).  \n\n\nSo why'd be we him put down? Because he'd stopped using his litter and the neat-freak cat started peeing and pooping everywhere; including on the kitchen table. Sometimes there was blood. He'd get spooked over nothing and run head-first into walls or start \"screaming\" and thrashing about randomly late at night. These were things that only we as his owners saw. Turns out the brain damage and his old age tag-teamed him and he had was was basically cat dementia and a kidney infection he'd hidden until it was too late. Only we and the vet knew that.  \n\n\nSo, we made the hardest damn choice and put him down while he still had SOME quality of life so that he'd not get to the point he'd suffer just so we'd still have him. Theo COULD have survived surgery and lived another couple months, maybe. But you decided \"No. He will NOT suffer because of what I want.\" Because let's be honest: We'd ALL choose to have our animals live as long as possible. But only a selfish asshole would choose that OVER the happiness and comfort of the animal.  \n\n\nSo you are NTA and aren't even close.

At a certain point it becomes very difficult to maintain decent quality of life for an old animal, and the kindest things we can do as caretakers is to give them a painless, peaceful death where they are with the ones they love so much. You took good care of him, you took him to the vet to get their expert advice, and you made the best decision for your dog.

But **it's better to make the decision a little early, than to make it too late.**\n\nI second guessed myself for *years* after putting my beautiful black cat down. But it was the right thing. He had developed a tumor. He was too old to operate on, and the vet said we could just wait and see. But there was no chance of it getting better, and I didn't want to sit and wait for it to only get worse. He was uncomfortable, and I didn't want it to become pain.\n\nHe was a stubborn old man at 20, actively collecting health issues, and I suspect he would have given Death the middle finger forever, if I hadn't made the decision. That doesn't mean he would have been happy.  The tumor was just the final straw that made me ask \"what am I doing?\"", "OP, NTA. You are not even the **slightest** bit TA. Your dad is right; you had to make the right decision for Theo. It's a hard decision and a horrible decision to have to make, but you did it **because** he loved you, and **because** he trusted you. I just spent the last 6 months trying to baby my 15yo terrier into health enough to operate on some bad teeth, but her kidneys failed before we could get her there, and there was nothing we could do to make that better.

If it had been a single issue and the prognosis had been decent, then yes operation would have been an option. But I've had vets refuse operations on older animals because though they'd come through the operation ok,they'd likely pass during the recovery period if old and frail. Theo ,from your account, had more than one issue and was declining. Pancreatic issues are very painful and his body was failing (new infections and bleeding out). You did the most loving and bravest final thing you could do - to recognise he was in pain, that there was little hope of alleviating it and put his needs before your very real need to have him with you. Iam so sorry for your loss. \n\nYour BF didn't see your dog at his worst.He left a dog that looked comfortable and then was told he was PTS. How fast an ill animal can decline can be shocking. Your BF made the choice to turn his phone off when you were nursing a very sick animal - that made it impossible to contact him. You tend to leave phones on if a loved one in very poor health. That's on him though it may be driving his guilt. If he keeps guilt tripping you, arrange to talk to the vet so he gets an impartial view.  But also consider this - he is blaming you a lifetime owner and lover of Theo for not waiting and leaving the dog in pain so he could control your decision. Theo wasn't his dog - would he have funded the surgery?  I find it a little odd for him to be taking his anger and guilt on you while you are literally vomiting from grief.\n\nI've taken on animals with issues or in old age before.

And I second guessed myself a lot. Her regular vet got the records from the emergency vet and talked me through it and made me feel a lot better.  She'd always said my cat reminded her of one of her cats, and she seemed to really think everything through before saying that she would have made the same choice.  \n\nI think it's only normal that you'll be second guessing yourself for a while but when it happens, try to remind yourself that you made the best choice for your dog to keep him from suffering.

No, he got angry with you and is saying things like what you did was betray your dogs love and trust in you, when you did what you thought would be the most loving choice for your pet. *That\u2019s not exactly cool.* He should have faith and trust that you had Theo\u2019s best interest at heart, not berating you because he would have done things differently.\n\nYou did the best thing for Theo.

She was in a lot of pain after that, until my parents and I finally put her down. If I could go back in time, I would make sure to not make her suffer like that again. Sometimes the best decision is to allow your pet to go, rather than keeping it alive but in a lot of pain.\n\nYour dog was in pain, you took the best decision. I'm sure your dog knew why you were doing this, and he knew how much you loved him. You did everything right! I hope you don't feel guilty and if so, I hope you'll be able to forgive yourself. You were a great pet owner to Theo.", "NTA - choosing to put our beloved pets down at the end of a well-lived life so that they don't have to suffer through pain and torment that they don't understand is out last responsibility to them.

There was no way for your beloved pet to return to how he was. Sadly, death is a part of life, and it seemed to be your dog's time. Just know that you did what was best for you and your pet. You did a great job in keeping him healthy and happy for as long as you did.\n\nI'll agree with other posts I'm seeing, saying it's selfish to keep a pet alive, and unbearable pain for their own comfort. What you did was hard, OP. But you did do the Right thing.", "NTA. You did your best and gave your dog a happy life. Your BF is an AH and to be honest just showed his hand to you.

You know there's people who just leave the room and let the doctor just take care of it. THAT is abandonment, having your pets' last moments be without the people that loved and took care of them. You are so strong to have made this decision for your baby rather than just let him suffer, and even stronger for staying by your baby till the very end. If I did the math right Theo had 16 beautiful years with someone that loved him and it sounds like it was his time, you let him go gentle into that good night. Your boyfriend is very immature and selfish to think it would've been a good idea to find second opinions. This dog was 16~ years old with pancreatitis, a new infection and **internal bleeding**. Putting him through surgery would've been a disservice even if he did survive cuz then what next? Something else would've popped up that would've needed to be taken care of, you couldn't keep fixing him forever.\n\nNTA and I am sorry for your loss I couldn't stop crying reading this cuz I'll never be ready for that pain when it's my baby's (kitty) time. I can't believe your partner treated you like this after what happened, even if he's grieving too he should've been there for you not blame you and make you feel worse.

My family made a similar decision about our dogs when they were very old and had numerous health problems that were causing them pain, which no amount of veterinary care could alleviate anymore. They gave us love their entire lives, and in turn, we gave them the most peaceful and comfortable death possible, at home and held by the people who loved them. It was never about money\u2014we would have paid anything, and the service to have them put down at home wasn\u2019t exactly cheap anyhow\u2014or not wanting them around anymore. It was because the alternative was for them to continue suffering, which there was no fix for, and which would have eventually ended in a much more painful death. I think some people, when faced with their pets\u2019 mortality, just refuse to accept it and think that throwing more procedures and surgeries at them will make them immortal. \nIt\u2019s such a difficult decision. But in circumstances like yours, it was also the right one for your dog. Again, I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nPlease talk to someone about your grief.

It\u2019s the hardest decision one can make but we owe it to our pets to not let them suffer \nIn my opinion you did the right thing, a dog at his age should not have to go through surgery! Even if he would have survived that, there would still have been the long process of healing after surgery and who knows if his immune system could have handled that\u2026 making him go through all that would have been cruel and selfish - you did everything you could and spared him from suffering any longer just to make you feel good!\nAs for your BF, he probably loves Theo a lot and burst out in frustration because he missed the chance to say goodbye.

He knew you were there for him in the end and he wasn't scared. He had you and that's all that mattered.\n\nYour boyfriend on the other hand is a huge asshat. Fuck him for berating you when you've just gone through hell. He doesn't get a say on what happens with YOUR dog. Especially when he wasn't there for you when you needed him.

All that would have done was hurt you and Theo more.", "NTA - part of owning and loving your pet is knowing when it is time to make that call and to be there with them in their final moments.

You aren't an asshole for taking that one final step of being a caregiver. \n\n\nI've had dogs all my life and while the loss of a pet is devastating, you owe them death with dignity and without pain.

You gave him a great life and at the end you didn't let him suffer. \n\n\nI had a cat who I loved more than anything. One day, Bug was diagnosed with cancer. 9 days later we helped him cross over to the rainbow bridge. It was 9 days between finding out my heart-cat had cancer and letting him go. I have questioned my choices over the years but have to keep reminding myself: he didn't enjoy life anymore. He wasn't able to clean himself and he LOVED cleaning himself. He was suffering and the cancer was progressing faster than we could find it. I needed to set aside my own selfishness and help him not hurt anymore. You did that. You did that for Theo because you love him. You were strong and helped him go peacefully with you next to him, rather than alone or traumatically during surgery. You will never not love him, and the grief will likely steal your breath away even years down the road. It's been over 3 years and reading your post brought me right back to the room where we let Bug go and stole my breath. \n\n\nYour boyfriend is wrong, and keeping an animal alive when they are not enjoying life anymore is selfish. Working in pet care, it hurts so incredibly much to have to care for animals that are still alive because their humans won't help them go peacefully and with dignity.

It hurts to see them in pain, but it also hurts to have to make that decision. You made the right call. When I had to make this decision, my partner was supportive. He loved her just as much as I did. While I can see how yours is also grieving and lashing out, please don't doubt your decision. He wasn't there. He didn't see it as you did. I won't presume to tell you how to handle him, but take a step back and focus on the memories. It will hurt like hell, but soon, you'll find comfort in them.

He was the first animal I had ever seriously thought about putting myself into debt for when he got crystals and the choice was surgery or putting him down.\n When he was 15 he started peeing blood. The vet assumed it was bladder stones he couldn\u2019t pass. When I finally agreed to the surgery, it wasn\u2019t stones and half his bladder was cancer and I agreed to just let him be out to sleep while on the operating table. I BAWLED for days and still feel guilty about going to work instead of taking him to the vet. It still kills me that he\u2019s gone, but I know I did the right thing.\n\nYou did the right thing as well. You made sure a beloved family member was well taken care of and allowed to pass in as pain free man we as possible. we should all be so lucky.", "Putting your furbaby to sleep when they are in pain is the last loving thing you can do for them. Don't feel guilty. You did what is right for Theo.", "NTA you did the right thing he did trust you. Which is why you did the last act of love and compassion for Theo. I lost my 16 year old dog yesterday  so I feel your pain. Your boyfriend is grieving but he is being needlessly cruel. I am so sorry for your loss", "NTA but your BF is sure acting like one. Our pets rely on us to make those hard decisions in their best interest, which is exactly what you did. Your boyfriend making you feel guilty for that is disgusting behavior.", "You did nothing wrong. Thank you for doing whats best for your dog and for being with him until the end.", "I have 6 animals, 1 dog 5 cats, and have had animals my whole life.

You\u2019re nta. The only way you could\u2019ve been the ah was if you had put Theo through surgery at his age despite the possible risks and complications. Your vet, the PROFESSIONAL, would not have suggested euthanasia if it had not been the best, most comfortable option for your pup. \n\nWe recently had to have our boxer, Maggie, put down. She was only 8 years old. She suffered from seizures due to a surgery she had for a flipped stomach a couple of years prior. We had her on medicine, but it eventually got to the point where she had seizures despite the phenobarbital and was suffering from incontinence. She also had a tumor on her lung that could not be operated on and we couldn\u2019t do radiation due to her seizures. Had she just been incontinent, I would have gladly put diapers on that dog until the day she died. But she didn\u2019t always know where she was anymore. She was coughing up blood due to the tumor and she was having frequent absence seizures. We made the heartbreaking decision to have her put down. Why? Because she deserved to not be in pain. Man, when I think of the years that that dog gave to me? She would have done anything to make me happy. She would have followed me off the side of this planet. How could I ever deny her a peaceful death? That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t hard. That doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t feel like I was giving up on her. But I knew, and my vet knew that putting her down was the best option for her. And you made the best decision for your boy. You got to hold him while he passed and I\u2019m sure there wasn\u2019t ever a day where he didn\u2019t know that you loved him. He was safe and comfortable and loved when he passed over to the dog rainbow bridge. And he deserved to be comfortable and happy. And you gave that to him despite the pain it caused you. \n\nAnd it\u2019s ok for your boyfriend to be upset. But what\u2019s not ok is for him to act like you\u2019re the bad guy because despite how much he loved Theo, Theo was not his dog. Theo was your dog. You made the best and most peaceful decision for your dog. Please understand that the vet would not have suggested putting your dog down if it wasn\u2019t time. It wasn\u2019t like Theo only had a broken paw. He had pancreatitis and an infection. And even if Theo had survived the surgery, he would have been in pain. Your boyfriend is being insensitive. He\u2019s allowed to be sad, but he doesn\u2019t get to take that grief out on you, Theo\u2019s actual owner. \n\nNta, op. And I\u2019m sending love your way. I know how sad this is for you. But I hope you can take comfort in the fact that you are a good, nay, GREAT pet owner. You put his comfort above your happiness and that is what counts. \n\nMany hugs from an internet stranger and fellow dog owner \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3e", "We had to put our beautiful girl to sleep on my brother\u2019s birthday. It was the worst birthday ever and the hardest choice we ever had to make, but it was either put her to sleep or watch her suffer for a couple more days. Losing her still hurts and we\u2019ve only just now passed the year mark. It always hurts, but if the option is either watch them suffer or let them go, the choice should always be let them go because it\u2019s not fair otherwise. The boyfriend is stupid.", "I had to put my dog down 4 years ago and it was the hardest decision I ever had to make. I\u2019d kept her alive longer than I should have, but soon realized I was being selfish and causing her pain and suffering to avoid my own.

I've struggled everytime with is it my responsibility or right to help them pass easily.  The religious dogma surrounding this has clouded many of our emotions towards death and suffering. If there is no chance that the dog can recovery and they are in debilitating pain it would be abuse to not help them finalize when we have the means to. I'm so sorry that your boyfriend isn't mature enough to recognize this. Losing a pet is never easy and helping them beyond is even harder due to the second guessing. You did the right thing, big hugs.", "You have top comment, forgot your judgment tho.", "You clearly loved Theo, so I'm sure your BF was right about one thing: Theo trusted you.\n\nTheo trusted you to do the right thing for him, which is this case was to make the unbelievably painful decision to ease his pain and let him go. The selfish thing would have been to ask Theo to live in terrible, terrible pain just so you didn't have to say good bye for a little while longer.\n\nI've been down that road twice. Both times I laid on the floor and looked into my boy's eyes and stroked his fur while he went to sleep, so I know how incredibly hard it was for you to make that decision. You didn't abandon Theo. You were there for him when he needed you most, and you put his needs above your own. That was the bravest and most loving thing you could do for him.", "And 'People who ~~jeep~~ *euthanize* their animals ~~alive for themselves when they are suffering~~ *so that they can \"be there\" when they die* are selfish pricks.'  \n\nIf you can't speak to the animal, you don't know what it wants.  IMO, the best gauge is whether or not they're eating.  If they choose to eat, they're choosing to stay alive and are finding some enjoyment from life.  If they refuse food, they don't want to.  Making that decision for an animal *can* be humane, but stating that it *is* humane is making a huge slew of assumptions about the animal and the situation.  \n\nAnd the idea of an anesthetized dog lamenting the idea of \"dying alone\" is a ridiculous example of anthropomorphizing.  The thought of \"I want to be there when they die\" is for the owner, not the pet, and the idea of unnecessarily killing an animal \"to be there for its death\" is just as selfish as keeping an animal alive against its will.  \n\nMy partner currently rides and trains horses at a barn here.  Many are ride-able, some are not.  We were feeding and exercising a pair of senior horses 1-2 times per week.  They had some health issues and were not cleared to be ridden.  One had hoof issues and clearly some discomfort/pain, but she *loved* food, tried to steal her friend's, etc.  The other had cushings.  Good boy, understood that his food was his own.  We'd walk them around the barn and let them graze some -- they were always excited to get out.  Excited to the point of trotting/cantoring with me when they got out, sore hooves and all.  Last year, my parents visited for Thanksgiving.  We took my folks to the barn and let that pair of horses out for a walk.  Granted, I think they were mostly motivated by the prospect of dinner, but on the return leg, those two horses cantered back and...yeah.  They were excited and happy.  I had to physically drag the old boy away from the fresh grass on the side of the path.  He had his issues, but he was sure as hell enjoying life.  They both loved attention, being groomed, food...as far as horses go, they were pretty darn happy.  \n\nTheir owner wouldn't return texts / schedule feeding for the following week.  We found out at the end of that week -- she had them both put down the morning after we took them out.  My partner was dumbstruck.  I was angry.  My parents only saw the horses on that one night, but were surprised and didn't understand.  One of them is a doctor..\n\nWhen you say \"People who keep their animals alive for themselves when they are suffering are selfish pricks\" you're suggesting that it applies to OP's situation.  \n\nOP's father offered his opinion: \"Theo shouldn\u2019t live in pain and it would be better to be with him when he passed then let him die alone in surgery.\"\n\nOP's father is not a veterinarian.  He didn't know what Theo's prognosis would have been if the surgery had been successful.  There is a good chance that Theo would not have \"lived in pain.\"  We don't know.  But, even if he would have been in pain...would Theo have wanted to die?  We don't know.  \n\nThe argument OP gave for euthanizing Theo was that she thought that Theo would rather die from euthanasia next to OP...than have an operation / shot at a longer life.  You wouldn't euthanize *grandma* because the holidays are over and you need to go back home / want to be there for her death....right?  Euthanasia would only be on the table if the person explicitly asked for it.  \n\n=> If Theo was eating, he probably wanted to live and shouldn't have been put down. \n\nUnfortunately, Theo couldn't speak, and is now dead, so we'll never know what he wanted.  I hope he wanted death, because that's what he got.", "I knew a woman with a 23 (yes 23) year old mini poodle. The thing had almost no hair, couldn't walk, no teeth, was deaf and blind AND had to go in for infusions and dialysis 3 to 4x a week at $2500 a week. She did this to the poor dog for a year. It was awful. Every time I saw that dog (she carried it on walks around the block), I silently said a prayer that the poor thing would go in its sleep. Well, one day, it did. However, the woman woke up shortly after the dog passed, call 911. 911 refused to send help for a 23 yr old dead dog. So she took it to the vet herself. She demanded they try to revive her 23 yr old dog who had been gone for at least an hour at that point.\n\nAt some point, keeping an animal alive should count as abu$e.

Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  \nThey all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.\n\n  \nThen you cross Rainbow Bridge together\u2026.\"\n\n\\~author unknown", "NTA but your bf is.

Mind, we broke up extremely amicably and still get along, but I just want to highlight how even though he didn\u2019t have to, he chose to be a kind and compassionate support for me during that time.

So many pets don\u2019t make it to old age and getting to see one off to the rainbow bridge while holding them in your arms is bittersweet, but it\u2019s the trade off for all the good years.

Grief makes people really distraught it's not an excuse to be an ass but I noticed people with their first pets in adulthood have this reaction a lot more often whereas when you have a pet as a child you've likely had them all your life and understand death with pets a bit more.  It's not a desire to watch them suffer but an inability to give up the same way people don't give up on family members and want second opinions.  This may even be the first close death your boyfriend has experienced", "NTA this is the one thing we can do for them when they are in pain. We can't explain that they might get better, all dogs know is that they are in pain and they can't stop it. You did the most unselfish thing for your pet, and you held him till he passed.

Besides, there are phone settings that can force your phone to ring if a certain person calls you X number of times. Your AH ex should look into that.", "NTA.

My baby started to have breathing issues and we went to the vet. $600 down and not knowing what was even wrong, just that her lungs dark on xrays. We were looking at $6000 just to find out what was wrong, not even treating it and they vet told me straight up, given how her breathing was there was about a 5% chance that would even give her another year of life. \n\nI struggled with the decision so hard over the phone, due to covid things not much was in person. When I finally made the call I was still waffling on my decision until I saw her. She was in an oxygen cage and when I opened the door to pet her, she came to sniff my hand, rubbed on me, then went to the back to put her nose against the oxygen vent. I knew then that she was suffering so hard.", "My cat also had to be put down a few years ago from cancer. At first, treatment was looking good and he responded well, but soon he deteriorated and it stopped working, after which I decided to have him euthanised.

It's better to ask yourself if you should have fought more, spent more, waited longer- than it is to look back and say, I wish I hadn't put them through all of that.  Op, your dog passed comfortably in your arms knowing that he was loved.  This is a hard, hard decision. I am a farmer and it's a decision I never thought I'd have to make as much as I have.

Why tf would you want a dear beloved pet to suffer for months or YEARS just so you can delay having to say goodbye?! It sucks, and it's so hard, but you HAVE to accept when the time has come and not put them through any unnecessary suffering just because you wanna delay the inevitable.

Are you just prolonging the inevitable, at the cost of your pet's comfort and happiness?

I left for a gig and never saw him again.
