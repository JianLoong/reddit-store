I confronted Silvia on this, because she shouldn\u2019t say things like that to my sister. I basically just said to Silvia to stop saying she was my moms one true love, because that wasn\u2019t true, my dad was.\n\nThis caused a huge argument between Silvia and I and she accused me of just not wanting my mother to move on and be happy. I told her that wasn\u2019t the case, and that she shouldn\u2019t be telling my sister that my father wasn\u2019t our Mothers soul mate.

Because we can absolutely guess what her next move is going to be. She has already banned you from seeing your sister. Next is your mom.", "NTA - she really shouldn\u2019t be saying that. It seems incredibly rude and inconsiderate of her, considering she knows the history with your dad.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, if its your mother's house and she isn't married to Sylvia, she can't really stop you from coming over just because she is there.\n\nSecondly, what she is saying to your sister is highly inappropriate and honestly not even necessary. Although, this is a conversation your mother needs to have with her, not you. Of course your mother deserves to move on and find someone to love but that doesn't mean her love for her deceased husband is no more. \n\nAlso, you can't speak for your mother on her love life because only she is the judge for that, but good for you for trying to stick with your sister.

It's a fairy tale, just like \"one true loves\"\n\nBut your dad was your mom's love of her life. But sadly life ends.

She could have been more understanding about why this whole thing bothered you and your sister. Reacting by telling you that you're living in a fantasy, calling you a name, and asking you not to come by wasn't necessary. \n\nThat being said, it's not your place to tell your mother's partner that she isn't your mother's soulmate. I'm sure you can understand how, just as you're offended by her discounting your mother's relationship with your father, she would be offended by you discounting your mother's relationship with her.
