Grief is a horrible thing and everyone is going to react differently just trying to survive it.

Imagine a man in mourning, crying and beating his fists on a wall until he collapses in grief. His grief is anger right now because he hasn\u2019t yet accepted what has happened; the truth is that either way, he may have put his blame on you. It\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s not necessarily even about the home (even though they received warnings); this is not a \u201cfault\u201d. But for the grieving, they must have something or someone to blame, at least for a little while as part of the process, until they can come to acceptance. That may take time and you do not have to stick around to take the brunt of his accusations; but deep down, just know that above all else, he really truly does blame himself. The responsibility of that partial truth must weigh so heavily on his and his wife\u2019s heart, especially because they chose to do the home birth anyway, despite doctor\u2019s warnings and perhaps even orders. This is the greatest grief and ultimately is the root of his suffering: there is no single one person to blame for the injustice of his child\u2019s death and the fact that they have to pay for an exorbitant amount for such healthcare. This is what happens when healthcare is transactional, everyone expects that the product - the person being treated - will be alright in exchange for the money and care. Now in the throes of what should have been a celebration of new life?m, they are stuck with a lot of debt that was gathered in love but no child to show for it, they must feel just so, so lost.

It\u2019s easy to let yourself get consumed with anger towards the entire world. It\u2019s a pain that nobody should have to ever go through. But you did help him, you took care of a lot of that debt, and ultimately he would\u2019ve had to go through a financial burden regardless because there was no way that they weren\u2019t going to TRY to save their baby.

So what, you should have told him his kid is hopeless and not to even try, and then not even tried to help? Would he have preferred just letting his baby die?\n\nAbsolutely NTA.

But def NTA", "NTA\n\nYou had never seen, diagnosed, or treated the baby. You were not asked to do any of those things or provide a 2nd opinion - you were asked for money. \n\nThe baby's doctor should have given the parents the prognosis.", "Yaaarrr me lass, ye be not the scurvy dog. It be a terrible shame when a pap loses his boy, and he be grievin. He probably don't really blame ya, it just be in our nature to have to blame SOMETHING for the random tragedies.", "NTA.  You can't diagnose a patient over the phone.  And you weren't the baby's doctor.\n\nHe's grieving so give him time to cool off.  Like, what is he saying?  \"No, I would not have wasted money and effort saving my child?\"", "I think he was just venting his anger, grief and frustration.

Very unfortunate situation, but you were not his doctor and not in the position to declare a prognosis. \nNTA.", "NTAH. Take it easy on your T\u00edo.

That's fucking tragic and terrible, cut him some slack for acting out.  That doesn't excuse his actions but at least provides context.  Hopefully in a few weeks he'll apologize for how he acted.  If he isn't the type of person that is emotionally mature enough to apologize he'll probably do the thing where he just acts like it didn't happen and everyone is supposed to do the same.

You should have been upfront and tell them what's going on cause he could have taken a better decision. That's just my opinion I don't want you to feel bad, I just think you made a mistake by not telling him", "NTA How could you possibly know if you hadn't seen the child yourself!? I think that this comes from the shock and the grief, and he's directing his emotions at you to try and blame someone even though there's nothing anyone could've done.", "NTA - he wants to guilt you into forgiving the debt he owes you.\n\nHe just lost his child so I\u2019d say cut him some slack emotionally for acting like an AH, but don\u2019t let him convince you this is your fault or your financial responsibility.", "NTA. Your Uncle is looking for someone to blame so he can have some reason for the tragedy.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like you were the dr overseeing his baby\u2019s case and knew the details of his condition. It sounds like your involvement only went as far as to offer financial help. It doesn\u2019t sound like you had access to his test results and it sounds like the infection spread quickly. It\u2019s a sad case but the fact that you\u2019re a dr doesn\u2019t mean you automatically knew every detail of a case you weren\u2019t medically involved in.", "NTA Just because you are a doctor doesn't mean you know everything and even if you were aware that the chances of death were high everyone wants to hope for the best in that kind of a situation. I would like to say that though your uncle seems to be saying some pretty messed up stuff and may not seem like he cares all that much about the baby rather than the debt he is grieving and may likely be using the financial debt as a distraction from the real source of his despair so try not to blame him for acting out. I know it's not easy to take that kind of thing but try to be patient and know that you're not in the wrong.", "NTA.

In fact just letting him get it all out and find even the smallest fraction of relief by doing so was a massive kindness. \n\nMore likely than not, when some time passes he will realize what he was unfair to you. He may reach out to make amends or he may recoil due to embarrassment. Just check up on him from time to time - perhaps three or four times over a year or three. \n\nI\u2019m sorry both for his loss and for you bearing the brunt of his grief.", "NTA and I hope that if he and his wife have another child they listen to the doctors and have a hospital birth. Unfortunately a baby had to die to make the point that listening to doctors about giving birth really is important.

That was not your job.", "NTA, they both knew the risk for home birth and went with it anyway", "Exactly this.  I think most Drs will body  swerve family and recommend a colleague.\n\nUncle should of asked questions of hospital.

They did it anyway, child did end up dying.\n\nThe mother, his sister in law, has never forgiven him for saying that. That was over 40 years ago.", "Agree that uncle is not TA.

Be up front about the odds, and if it really is the end then encourage them to focus on giving that person the most comfortable life they can. Some people still won\u2019t be ready to hear it, but you\u2019ve gotta try. \n\nIt\u2019s hard because we can usually recognize with our pets that the most humane option is to let them go before they suffer too greatly.
