Was he implying that if he knew how serious the infection was he would have just let nature take it\u2019s course, for lack of a better term?

He just wants someone to blame.", "NTA. It was the treating physician\u2019s job to inform the parents of the prognosis. Perhaps your uncle is needing to blame someone due to his grief?  Sorry for your family\u2019s loss, OP.", "NTA. You didn't actually see the child so had no real evidence of what was happening. All you could say was in many cases this happens. His blame if any rests with the doctors who actually treated his child.", "I'm going to give your uncle the benefit of the doubt and hope his unreasonable behaviour is due to grief.   \n\nNTA", "Not at all. The baby wasn't in your care, it was in theirs.", "NTW\n\nFirst, you weren't the baby's doctor. \n\nSecondly, the money was well spent and he's just grieving and is looking to vent although you are most certainly the wrong target. There is no right target and thus it ends up on someone that is easily made a scapegoat.\n\nThird, there was always a chance the child could've lived and even if that chance was small it is definitely worth the money and effort because if it had worked he'd be rejoicing. There are miraculous people that have survived against all odds to go on to live successful and rewarding lives. No one can tell the future. \n\nPeace and I wish you and your uncle and his wife all the best. Hopefully, he'll come to see reason and admit his mistake in blaming you and let love back into his heart.", "NTA.  This baby was not your patient so I assume you had no firsthand information or crystal ball to predict the future.  It is normal for a family to do all they can to save their baby and hope for a good outcome and this is what, I assume, you all did and in good faith.  It is not your fault that his son died.  He's likely in grief now and not thinking clearly.\n\nYou could not positively know the outcome for sure and he must understand this.  If you'd told him it looked bad but maybe there was a chance (as I assume there was), would he have denied treatment?  Probably not.  We almost always try to save our babies but obviously do not always succeed.", "NTA\n\nThis is a lose-lose situation.  Spending this much money with that outcome is terrible, of course. Both financially and emotionally.  \n\nBut NOT having spent the money would always have left them wondering if there was something, ANYTHING they could have done.\n\nYour uncle is hurting a lot right now, please be patient with him and hopefully he will come around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's yelling at death for taking his baby. I'm so sorry.  NTA.", "True", "What? Lol It\u2019s very obvious the uncle is grieving and is fucked up by that. He\u2019s angry because he lost his son. Nobody in this case is an A.", "I don't know. The loss of this money may mean not being able to feed the other kids. I am not sure I can judge him on that.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. You helped him monetarily when he asked. As you hadn\u2019t seen the baby or their charts, you couldn\u2019t have known his prognosis, even knowing the infection in general is bad.", "Decades ago, my mother contracted MRSA during a hospital stay. The only person giving what turned out to be the accurate prognosis was a family member who is a doctor. It was incredibly difficult to hear what she had to say while the treating physicians all were encouraging us, falsely, to remain hopeful. I can only imagine how your Uncle would have reacted if you had told him the truth, but, based on my experience, it would have been pretty bad.\n\nThe death of a child is a terrible, terrible thing under any circumstances. You and your family have my deepest condolences. You're NTA, of course, and, perhaps, as your uncle processes his grief, he'll see things more rationally.", "Nowhere on the planet is diagnosing a third party via a telephone call the standard of care. It's sad that your nephew died in infancy, but you are NTA.", "NTA- you cant play god! Sometimes the odds against someone are very strong but they overcome.. it wasn\u2019t your  call to take away the chances of that baby to see if given all opportunities he was gonna get better or not", "NTA- His own doctors are at fault if they didn\u2019t inform him properly. You literally gave him money to help him try to save the child. Unless you\u2019re pressing him to repay you immediately, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\nI don\u2019t know your uncle, so this is just a general statement, but his reaction could be due to grief.  It probably is stressful to go into all that debt and then for it to fail makes one feel very powerless. When we feel powerless, we sometimes create a villain to blame to feel better. \n\nYou might say something like, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for nothing. You took the opportunity to show your child how much you love him.\u201d Again, only YOU know if that\u2019s a good idea or not. Try to remember that we all act out in times of stress and grief. That doesn\u2019t make it ok, but might help you cope with such a foul accusation.", "NTA OP, even if he knew the chances were slim wouldn\u2019t he have taken it?\nNevertheless, give him sometime, I\u2019m sure he is just blinded by the pain right now.", "This is why I tell my silly family not to do home births. NTA", "Did you know how bad it was? Or how it was likely to end?  Did he ask you to tell him how bad it was before you gave him 30k?! If no to any of these then NTA.", "I'M gonna say NAH. Yeah you're a doctor, but not the baby's doctor. \n\nI also can't call your uncle TA, because he's a grieving father who needs someone to blame, and you just happen to have the education and training so his brain(which can't be functioning properly right now) puts it on you. \n\nI'd bet with a little time for his mind and heart to heal, he'll realize that under the circumstances there was nothing you or probably anyone could do and he'll regret blaming you", "Where you the attending OB/GYN?\n\nWhy would you know about their son's condition?\n\nYou Aunt chose to have a home birth.  There are som inherent risks with that choice.\n\nI am speculating that your uncle is grieving and lashing out sue to his grief.  It is very raw, right now.\n\nNTA unless you actually knew something about the case.", "NTA - You were not the doctor of this child or the mother; you were getting third hand information at best, and it sounds like they were warned about dangers of home birth. Sadly, there was nothing YOU could have done more than what you did. I say let him yell at you; he needs someone to blame for this tragedy. You know it's not your fault, so try not to take his blame to heart. It's a very sad situation for you all, and my condolences go to you and your family.", "NTA\n\nI feel sorry for your uncle and aunt. There was nothing more you could have done as your uncle would have blamed you if you gave him medical advice that may have had a negative outcome. As far as I know, medical staff are not to treat family for this reason.

You were not the baby's doctor 3. I don't think that they would've not spent the money if they knew what the prognosis was.

You can't properly diagnose family. As there is to much emotion involved. You were familie. Not the doctor.  And as family it is your place to have always hope. No matter how small. \n And to be honest. Would he really just have left it if you told him there was no hope?", "Yta", "Info: Did you ever attend the child first hand? Also, was the money you gave a loan with the expectation of being paid back?  \n\n\nI'm going to process assuming the answer to both my questions is \"no\" and will adjust if new information is presented to the contrary.  \n\n\nFor now the only true asshole here is the pay to play healthcare system in your country. Public option all z way (ESTD I know). I empathize with your whole family.  \n\n\nI empathize with you for trying to do the right thing and it still not panning out. I empathize with the family and the father because he too tried his best and not only lost his son but also possibly any level of financial \"stability\" he may have had. When you're already in a a difficult situation to be saddled with these losses it only compounds it.  \n\n\nHis anger is justified but misplaced and he's targeting someone he can actually affect. When I try to imagine the totality of the difficulty of the life he has lived and now faces it's easy to sympathize with him.  Whether he'll grow to understand that although justified that he's still in the wrong only he (and hopefully you if he apologizes to you) will know.   \n\n\nBased upon the information readily available NTA.", "It sounds like he\u2019s really deep in grief and looking for someone to blame. NTA. I\u2019m sorry for yours and his loss", "You might think that the poor baby\u2019s actual doctor would have relayed this information a little more clearly. So sad.", "Exactly.", "Even if you were directly asked, would it not be unprofessional/dangerous for you to provide a prognosis about the baby since he was not your patient? \n\nAdditionally, if he asked for the money and you told him \u201cwell, his prognosis is really bad, are you sure you want to spend that much on him?\u201d, that would not have been well received and a horrible thing to say to a parent trying to save their child. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair for your uncle to place any blame on you when you just did what you could to help, but I cannot even begin to imagine what he is going through. Hopefully he will see things more clearly and realize that he isn\u2019t really angry with you, but at the loss of his son. Grief is a horrible thing and everyone is going to react differently just trying to survive it.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s feeling a lot of guilt that this was a result of their choice to have a home birth, and it\u2019s easier direct anger towards you than come to terms with his own guilt and grief.  This is just such a horrible tragic situation all around, and I\u2019m so so sorry to your whole family. \n\nYou are NTA at all", "Even if you did know, it was still best you kept your professional opinion to yourself. Even if you suspected something or not, your opinion is affected by the family relationship and that can cloud anyone; it wasn't your place to say something. Imagine you did, and you were still wrong. \n\nIt's unfair that he is in debt, it's unfair he lost a child; he's taking out those feelings on you because there's nothing else concrete he can be angry at. Give him some time, maybe he will come around?", "He's similarly displacing the loss of the child onto loss of money. I don't know what country they're in, but in many cultures, the only emotional outlet men are really allowed is anger. OP, I hope you can see through the words to what's behind them and understand that this has almost nothing to do with you, and it's directed at you because you're a safe stand-in for medicine, fate, the universe, whatever. I'm not saying this fully excuses his behavior or you can't be upset, but just that it should be very clear you did nothing wrong, and the fact that he's saying what he's saying doesn't even exactly mean he thinks you did either.\n\nNTA"]}
