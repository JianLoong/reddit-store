He asked you for money not a prognosis.  I can only imagine his grief but his anger is misplaced.", "NTA, it was the responsibility of the baby\u2019s doctor that they were dealing with to go over everything that was happening with the baby. Was he implying that if he knew how serious the infection was he would have just let nature take it\u2019s course, for lack of a better term? I\u2019m sure he and his wife are grieving terribly, and he\u2019s just angry at the world.", "INFO: Did he ever actually ask your professional opinion about his son's prognosis? Did you ever offer an opinion?", "How did he expect you to diagnose a baby you'd never seen and weren't the doctor for???\n\nNTA\n\nHe's grieving as well as panicking about his financial situation and taking it out on the nearest handy punching bag.", "NTA.\n\nYou weren\u2019t treating the baby, you couldn\u2019t give a diagnosis.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your family\u2019s loss.", "NTA\n\nSo sad, but he is lashing out from the passing.  He just wants someone to blame.", "NTA. It was the treating physician\u2019s job to inform the parents of the prognosis. Perhaps your uncle is needing to blame someone due to his grief?  Sorry for your family\u2019s loss, OP.", "NTA. You didn't actually see the child so had no real evidence of what was happening. All you could say was in many cases this happens. His blame if any rests with the doctors who actually treated his child.", "I'm going to give your uncle the benefit of the doubt and hope his unreasonable behaviour is due to grief.   \n\nNTA", "Not at all. The baby wasn't in your care, it was in theirs.", "NTW\n\nFirst, you weren't the baby's doctor. \n\nSecondly, the money was well spent and he's just grieving and is looking to vent although you are most certainly the wrong target. There is no right target and thus it ends up on someone that is easily made a scapegoat.\n\nThird, there was always a chance the child could've lived and even if that chance was small it is definitely worth the money and effort because if it had worked he'd be rejoicing. There are miraculous people that have survived against all odds to go on to live successful and rewarding lives. No one can tell the future. \n\nPeace and I wish you and your uncle and his wife all the best. Hopefully, he'll come to see reason and admit his mistake in blaming you and let love back into his heart.", "NTA.  This baby was not your patient so I assume you had no firsthand information or crystal ball to predict the future.  It is normal for a family to do all they can to save their baby and hope for a good outcome and this is what, I assume, you all did and in good faith.  It is not your fault that his son died.  He's likely in grief now and not thinking clearly.\n\nYou could not positively know the outcome for sure and he must understand this.  If you'd told him it looked bad but maybe there was a chance (as I assume there was), would he have denied treatment?  Probably not.  We almost always try to save our babies but obviously do not always succeed.", "NTA\n\nThis is a lose-lose situation.  Spending this much money with that outcome is terrible, of course. Both financially and emotionally.  \n\nBut NOT having spent the money would always have left them wondering if there was something, ANYTHING they could have done.\n\nYour uncle is hurting a lot right now, please be patient with him and hopefully he will come around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You helped him monetarily when he asked. As you hadn\u2019t seen the baby or their charts, you couldn\u2019t have known his prognosis, even knowing the infection in general is bad.", "Decades ago, my mother contracted MRSA during a hospital stay. The only person giving what turned out to be the accurate prognosis was a family member who is a doctor. It was incredibly difficult to hear what she had to say while the treating physicians all were encouraging us, falsely, to remain hopeful. I can only imagine how your Uncle would have reacted if you had told him the truth, but, based on my experience, it would have been pretty bad.\n\nThe death of a child is a terrible, terrible thing under any circumstances. You and your family have my deepest condolences. You're NTA, of course, and, perhaps, as your uncle processes his grief, he'll see things more rationally."]}
