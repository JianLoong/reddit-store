I would never say this to anyone but felt that it is an important detail here. \nDuring the baby shower my sister was going around to everyone and getting them to rub her belly so they could feel the baby kicking. When she came up to me I politely declined. She started insisting that the aunt should feel the baby and tried to grab my hand to put on her stomach. I told her that I was uncomfortable and didn\u2019t want to, and tried to gently shake her off of me. She did not react well to this and started crying that I must think her belly disgusting to touch and that I\u2019m hurting her feelings. When I didn\u2019t immediately disagree with her statement she started crying more. Others in the family started telling me to just feel the baby\u2019s movements and I being a brat about it. \n\nI was getting so hounded by most of the family that I left early.

Pregnancy is not an excuse to remove all physical boundaries. For my wife it was the opposite when she was pregnant. She was very uncomfortable with people trying to touch her belly. For you it is touching someone. Either way you are entitled to your boundary. Her feelings about it are irrelevant.", "NTA - I\u2019m due in a few weeks with what is quite possibly the most active baby ever in all existence, to coincide with the thinnest skin possible for a human. Even my obygyns are blow. away by what appears to be something out of a horror movie trying to make its way THROUGH my belly. And I don\u2019t even like it! I don\u2019t blame you one bit.", "NTA, you have zero responsibility to be physical with anyone you do not want to be physical with. She should have dropped the subject immediately when you politely declined.", "NTA\n\nPeople of earth when are we going to STOP making other people do stuff they are uncomfortable with. I'm not talking about making a child eat their vegetables I'm talking about making adults do random stuff. No, is a complete sentence let it go.", "Definitely NTA. Being pregnant does entitle someone to ignore other peoples wishes. You were politely clear that your didn\u2019t want to and she pushed it to where the argument went. You\u2019re not obligated to rub her pregnant belly just because your her sister! The whole thing is just weird.", "NTA . I would respond to them that I am not comfortable with the situation of touching others. I am sure feeling the baby move is amazing for some but it is just not something I am comfortable with personally.", "Ugh, NTA. Pregnant bellies are creepy. You have a right to your bodily autonomy.", "NTA\n\nI find the whole idea of rubbing a pregnant woman's belly invasive and uncomfortable. You shouldn't be forced to have to touch someone if you don't want to, under any circumstances. \n\nCould you have tried to reassure her that you don't find her gross? Yes and you should probably do that now.", "NTA.  Most pregnant women don't want you to touch their belly.  Maybe just take you sister out for something relaxing like pedicures and talk to her about it.", "NTA  \n\n\nThis is a consent issue. You have the right to personal bodily autonomy.   \n\n\nYou have the right not to be touched and you have the right not to touch. She does not have the right to grab your hand and force you to touch her belly.   \n\n\nThat your family and her are trying to force you to do something you're personally uncomfortable with is a boundary violation. I'm sorry. You deserve better.", "NTA. \n\nThe rules about touching people without permission work both ways. Don\u2019t make someone touch you when they don\u2019t want to.", "You\u2019re not alone in finding pregnant bellies gross, don\u2019t worry!", "NTA\n\nEw. You shouldn't be forced to touch anyone. While your sister and I might find you odd, that's your right and forcing you is extremely gross and inappropriate.", "You know how we give out n-t-a to people who actually *are* an asshole but it seems justified somehow?  Well, here we are going to give out YTA for someone who's *technically* correct but still an asshole.  \n\nDo you really think you handled this correctly?  I mean...  *really?*", "NTA. \n\nBut this could have been handled better.  You absolutely don\u2019t have to touch anyone you don\u2019t want to\u2026 especially your sister. But this feels like it could have been avoided.   Touching the belly is fairly common in baby showers, especially when the mom is getting closer to the delivery date.\n\nWas your sister aware that you\u2019re not particularly comfortable touching the belly?   I\u2019m willing to chalk all this up to hormones as well.  But what happened was she put you on the spot in front of everybody\u2026 you reacted bad, in front of everybody\u2026 which made her react worse.  \n\nII suggest taking the high road here and apologize.  I\u2019d have a one on one with her and let her know you love her, and you love her child\u2026 but physical contact is just something that\u2019s a bit of a mental block for you.   You\u2019re sorry you made a weird moment, and you know she\u2019s going to be an amazing mom.", "I know I have to give only one judgement but still. Was gonna say NTA but now I'm kinda leaning towards NAH. Either way you're not in the wrong.\n\nYou don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with, including touching your sister's stomach. You're not wrong for making that choice.\n\nBut don't expect a woman mid pregnancy to understand rational conversations (even if you are right). Her hormones are taking a toll on her right now and she probably had expectations and got a little sensitive when they were not met. It's not her fault she feels that way it's her hormones. \n\nTry talking to your sister once she feels a little better or maybe even after she delivers. I'm sure she'll understand some time from now. Be sure to be sensitive and don't use the word \"disgusting\". Just express that it's not something you're comfortable with. Let her know you're sorry for making her feel bad - but you're not sorry for making the decision not to actually touch her belly. If she already knew this though it would be a lil weird that she still forced you to touch it. But tell her again nevertheless and stand your ground.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
