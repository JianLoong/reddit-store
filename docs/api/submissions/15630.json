He\u2019s not allowed to constantly use those excuses. \nIf you buy the groceries i would just start buying vegetarian only things and so now you can have everything and they want meat then they can buy and make it themselves. That\u2019s so disrespectful to you. I bet if you got your own mini fridge and lockbox for it, he would still go through it. He knows they\u2019re your food. If you lock it he\u2019ll be upset. Either he needs to learn or he has some serious underlying problems surrounding food that need to be addressed NTA", "NTA, Coeliac here! When my family of non coeliacs eat my food it means I have to go without. Which is just ridiculous because the house is full of their food. Same exact thing here. It feels like laziness on your husbands part, easier to give the kids leftovers than make a new meal, faster to throw the pizza in your child\u2019s lunch than find something else.", "NTA. Is this rudeness and lack of consideration a new development or has he always been a jerk?", "NTA, sounds like he is just being lazy in not preparing himself or the kids food and taking the easy way out with your leftovers.\n\nYou set the boundary and he continues to cross it, especially considering your different (from the rest of the family) food needs. He is being TA here and needs to do better.\n\nAsk him how he would feel if the roles were reversed especially with takeaways and the treats.", "NTA he's being an asshole, he knows it upsets you and continues to do it", "NTA. Your leftovers are not a shortcut for his meal prep. That's basically it. Once in a blue moon, sure, no one's perfect when you have kids.\n\nEvery few days? His lack of forethought or energy does not make it a \"you\" problem. Locked fridge ho!", "Eating your leftovers is easier for him than making something new. He knows it might leave you without but still does it - which makes him selfish as well as lazy.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, your partner is not respecting your boundaries. It\u2019s time to get a lockable mini-fridge & start locking away your food, sadly.", "NTA\nYou communicated how this upsets you and your partner decided to ignore that, which is VERY inconsiderate. It is a reasonable boundary you set and your partner ignored it (on top of that made you feel bad about the kids). Have you tried offering getting enough vegetarian food for all of them? Or is this just simply, your partner is too lazy to make food?", "NTA-the partner IS TA however", "NTA. My ex husband ate my leftover Chinese food 13 years ago and I still haven't forgiven him.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries. You spoke with him about the issue and he still doesn\u2019t stop, which obviously gets you to the point when you lose control over your emotions. Buy lunch box with lock on it, and explain if he doesn\u2019t respects you then that\u2019s the only way to compromise\u2026", "NTA it's called weaponized incompetence,  this dude has no interest in preparing food for the kids or himself so he is going to keep taking it from you and it won't ever stop", "NTA. It is very rude of your partner to do this, especially as you have expressed this on multiple occasions. Body that you should have to, but have your tried labelling your food? That should give him another opportunity before he eats it or gives it away to really think about what he\u2019s doing.", "NTA \n\nHe just expressed clearly he doesn't care.", "NTA - I guess that it's easier for your husband to take your leftovers than to cook smthg. And the fact his respect for you does not win over his laziness is concerning (or forgetfulness or whatever lame excuse he had). Put your foot down and retaliate. One leftover taken = 1 week of your laziness taking over as well (his laundry not done, his office not cleaned, or whatever you can not do that doesn't impact the kids).", "NTA. Either he's making a power play or he's bad at his own/your kids' meal planning and treating your food as public property.\n\nYou need to invest in a lockable fridge.", "What are some of the excuses he comes up with? What's his reasoning other than \"must steal wife's food?\"", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be annoyed", "NTA I would go all banshee in him", "Why are they YOUR leftovers specifically? Or at least for homemade meals. Like if I make pasta for the family, and we put the leftovers away, I don't think any one person lays claim to them? Clearly I'm in the minority here since everyone else says you aren't the a-hole but honestly I think you're being kind of weird and territorial about food with your family.", "You're not the AH, but definitely new to this experience.  I suggest you get over it real quick because it's only going to get worse.  Wait until they're teenagers and you come home from a long day at work, you walk in the house, one of them has your food in hand and is eating while the other one just stands at the fridge with the door wide open, wasting your electricity, while they decide what they want.  Only to shut the door and go wrestle the other one for the leftovers of your leftovers.  And then they will look at you and say, \"Hey what's for dinner?  When are we eating?\"  As for the Spouse, I'll put it like my spouse did....\"What's yours is mine, and what's mine...is mine!\"  lol", "YTA\n\nMaybe I'm crazy but I like my children to eat. They can eat anything in the fridge. If they want to eat veggies, I'm happy about it. If it's leftovers, it means I already ate most of it. So youre fighting with your own children over scraps which doesn't seem parental to me at all\n\nMaybe I'm out of the ordinary, but growing up I never had an adult save special meals for themselves away from the children and now as an adult with kids/nephews/nieces/little cousins, I've never denied them anything in the fridge. Just seems wrong. \n\nSure the adults had their special snacks and such that I was not interested in (like sardines or radishes) but to be told \"no that's my food. You can't eat it\". Not a thing that happened in my house.", "You\u2019re treating your partner and your children like they\u2019re your roommates?  Why are they not allowed to have food?  Why are you making food that\u2019s only enough for you when you have kids?  Aren\u2019t they your kids?  It seems so strange to me that someone would be having a meal and not make/buy enough for their own children!  Do you and your partner share cooking responsibility equally?  It sounds like you\u2019re expecting him to cook for the children and you cook for yourself and want to protect your food from your own children like you\u2019re a hungry grizzly bear and they\u2019re a pack of wolves trying to steal your stash of food!  I\u2019m thinking YTA, but I\u2019m not getting what the dynamic is here.  These are your children?  You don\u2019t share food with your own children?", "NTA - maybe dose some leftovers with laxative or something? Kind of, if I can't have it you'll regret it... Someone else mentioned weaponised incompetence, I think it's a mixture of that and laziness. He knows it will piss you off, but also that there will be no long term consequences. Once he shits himself inside out he might rethink that philosophy?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Husband absolutely does not get my leftovers!  I think if something is bothering you and you\u2019ve discussed it with them and they continue to do it, that is kind of a jerk thing to do.  I would discuss with him buying more next time so he has what he wants for leftovers and doesn\u2019t need to eat yours.\n\nOr start hiding it in the vegetable drawer under the lettuce where he\u2019ll never find it!", "Question - is he actually giving the food and drink to the kids?

Why on earth does your kid need sandwiches and pizza? Are they not eating breakfast or out for twelve hours? I think this dude is either lying or just targeting you.

Then put op's pizza in there. No yound kid is going to eat all that", "They all eat meat. I'm vegetarian.\n\nI make my meals separate to theirs for the obvious reason.\nLike, if I make a lasagne, I'll add meat mince to theirs and use veggie mince or just vegetables for mine. \n\nSo if I go to pack my leftovers for work and my partner has taken my vegetarian meals, meanwhile there's still tonnes of meat portions left over... I'm going to be a little pissed. \n\nI don't mind sharing with my partner or kids.

Maybe that's her thing. \n\nIf husband cannot make an effort to leave 2 pieces of pizza that will make her happy and that will certainly not prevent the kids from eating, he is the AH. \n\nAnd sandwich and pizza?

I should have been more specific. \nThe leftover thing bothers me a lot, but my partner is also eating and giving the kids my vegetarian food that I would use for meals. \nThey eat meat. There is plenty of other food in the house that they can ALL have. \nWhen my vegetarian meals are being eaten, I'm not left with a lot.\n\nI always give the kids some of my treats/food if they want to try it. It's not as if they go without. I'm just finding it very frustrating. \n\nAnd also, I'm not mad at my kids. I'm mad at my partner for it.", "I save special things for myself all the time and I am in my 30's with a partner and child, perhaps it's something people growing up without a lot and/or with big families do.\n\nShe is allowed to have things for herself, especially considering her diet is different from the rest of the household, and it isn't as though there isn't other food for others to eat, her kids aren't starving while she squirrels away her takeaway pizza, the Dad is just being too lazy to prep them other food and taking the easy way out.", "As mentioned in a previous comment of mine... \n\nI make the meals. My partner packs the lunches. \n\nI'm vegetarian, they all eat meat.\n\nIf I make a lasagne, I add meat to theirs and I'll make a separate vegetarian one for myself.\n\nI also work nightshifts so I try to meal prep and freeze meals. \nIf I say to my partner, please don't touch my specific left over as I want to take it to work that night, I kind of expect it to still be there. \n\nThere is more than enough food in the house, which is why I've never understood why it has to be my food he uses.\n\nI also share my food. They all eat more than I do. \n\nI'm not mad or upset with my children, it's my partner I get annoyed at.", "Half of the post is about how he feeds these meals to their CHILDREN.", "He'd probably unplug it or turn off the power so she can't eat it anyway.

Or maybe he's just an ass who likes to see her upset.", "Not at all what I meant-I'll edit", "Does he cook at all? How do you deal with personal fun money?\n\nI would suggest that going forward, he owes you a home-cooked meal that he makes or a vegetarian take-away that is paid for out of his fun money every time he does this. If he eats or gives the kids your pizza, he buys another vegetarian pizza. If the pizza costs $20 and he was planning to go out to the bar with the boys on Thursday night, he has $20 less to spend. \n\nOr start cooking only vegetarian.

That way it doesn\u2019t matter if they eat the vegetarian food because it\u2019s all vegetarian.  They obviously prefer it that way, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be taking it first.", "fair point - definitely an oops on my part.
