Is this rudeness and lack of consideration a new development or has he always been a jerk?", "NTA, sounds like he is just being lazy in not preparing himself or the kids food and taking the easy way out with your leftovers.\n\nYou set the boundary and he continues to cross it, especially considering your different (from the rest of the family) food needs.

I\u2019m thinking YTA, but I\u2019m not getting what the dynamic is here.  These are your children?  You don\u2019t share food with your own children?", "NTA - maybe dose some leftovers with laxative or something? Kind of, if I can't have it you'll regret it...

Granted, my story may have no bearing at all on you and your partner's situation, but I think it might.\n\nGrowing up in my family, there was no such thing as \"owned\" leftovers.  If it was in the fridge, it was fair game.  The very concept of there being food in the fridge (or anywhere else in the house tbh) that was off limits to anyone in the family was just very foreign to my upbringing.  Food was a communal resource.  Then I married my wife.  In her house, literally *all* leftovers belonged to someone.  In her family it was super important to not. touch. anyone. else's. food.  \n\nI'll admit, when we first got married, it took me a fair bit of time to even wrap my mind around the idea that she viewed those leftovers in the fridge as \"hers\" and that I was crossing boundaries by eating them.  It took her just as long to understand that I didn't have a concept of individual ownership of food.  To me, it was obviously all communal.  To her, it was obviously private property.  \n\nOf course, this caused some friction in both directions when we first lived together.  But, we sorted it (and, frankly, a bunch of other stuff like this) out through clear, open, and repeated conversations.  It probably took the better part of a year for me to finally understand where she was coming from, and it took just as long for her to see my perspective.  After a few years, we came to a hybrid approach that worked for us and our family, that seemed strange to parents and siblings on both sides.  Now, 20 years later, it all seems like just so much ado about nothing.\n\nSo, if you've only talked to him once, talk to him again.  Figure out how he views \"ownership\" of leftovers generally.  Try to help him understand the way you see things.  See if there's room for compromise - in both directions!\n\n(If you've had repeated conversations with him about this and it's clear that he understands where you're coming from, then I'll vote with the rest of the thread and say NTA.)", "Buy like 4 pizzas each time.

This way, it ensures that you can have any leftover food", "Maybe you should be cooking vegetarian only from now on until your partner decides to not step on your boundaries and play that power game with you.\n\nNTA", "But....is yours a quarter the size of theirs? Or like, you get a whole lasagna and they get to split a lasagna?\n\n\nOr why not just have vegetarian lasagna for dinner or vegetarian pizza?", "Sweetheart.   Your partner picked a partner that is low/no contact with her family.   He ignores your wishes and contributions.  He refuses to let your friends around you.  He only let's his friends come and trash your new home.  He leaves you to clean up his messes and make him meals while he eats yours so you have to do more work.  Based on \"partner\" and not \"husband\" it looks like you're not married so he's keeping financial assets from you as well while you help the family.  \n\nHe's a manipulative partner at best, and more likely abusive.  \n\nHe's been trying to isolate you for a long time.", "Then you\u2019re NTA for being upset when your partner eats your leftovers but your kids are a shared responsibility, so you are TA when they eat it.  Also, just because your partner isn\u2019t a vegetarian doesn\u2019t mean that they might not have leftovers that are acceptable to you.  If that is the case, by your logic, you should not eat them.", "I read a bit of your history with this man. \n\nWhy are you putting up with this? He doesn't contribute financially, he's doing this as a power trip. He's not a good partner to you.", "As already mentioned, you should probably stop cooking them meat dishes so all the leftovers are fine for you. I'd say to talk to your husband about stopping this behavior, but it seems like you've told him several times and he's said he's going to stop, so I'd just get a fridge locker and put anything you need for your work lunch or that you specifically want to save in there. I also think maybe you should switch up the food responsibilities. You're working 12 hour shifts and still doing all the cooking and he can't even handle the much easier task of making their lunches without using your lunch? That doesn't sound fair. Maybe all meat related food should become his job.", "\n>There is more than enough food in the house, which is why I've never understood why it has to be my food he uses.\n\nBecause he wants you to know you don't matter. He wants you to believe that it makes sense for you to sacrifice for everyone else because your needs and feelings are not important.", "But he made multiple sandwiches so I am not sure why a young child would also need multiple slices of pizza on top of that. Definitely sounds like he's looking for ways to get rid of OP's leftovers and he didn't want to eat the pizza himself.", "What\u2019s crazy is that he did make a sandwich (possibly 2 since she put \u201csandwiches\u201d) and STILL packed the pizza! Like, what\u2019s his endgame here? Lol", "or both!  or all three (Adding in the control and power play)\n\nUltimately, it reeks of self-centered behavior and that what's best for him SHOULD be best for her since in his eyes she doesn't have her own identity or wants so why is she upset if it makes his life better to eat his food or give it to the kids.", "What a terrible piece of a husband.", "WTF? That is absolutely abhorrent behaviour.\n\nOP, I hope you realize that is not normal. I could not even *imagine* not \"allowing\" my wife to have her friends over to our house, that is.... I mean I don't even know what to say, that is fucked up.\n\nNTA.", "Yep, he is definitely doing that on purpose and then gaslighting her. GIRL, run!  He is an asshole and if you stay you will have many more years of posting in this sub.", "If he went to the effort of making the sandwiches, then I think it\u2019s the opposite of laziness! He is working hard to fuck with her food.", "Now that has to be a control thing. I\u2019m guessing this is more about your family wanting to control you in some way.", "It\u2019s not so simple when you\u2019re in an abusive relationship.", "I hope someone you love never gets stuck in an abusive relationship and asks you for help.", "She truly won\u2019t. I even got her a new, fresh pack of nuggets to make up for what I thought was abandoned nuggets. Lol", "I use a large deep roasting pan for theirs as it's 3 of them. I usually use a lot smaller pan for myself.\n\nWill suggest that though!", "I always make sure the freezer and fridge is stocked up with batch cooked meals, so when I'm sleeping during the day for my nightshifts he doesn't have to worry.\n\nI don't HAVE to cook meat and to be honest, I'd prefer not to as it makes me feel sick and goes against my morals.\n\nWe usually discuss what meals we want over a 2 week period and come to an agreement.\n\nThere's always more than enough for them, with several options, which is why I can never understand why he chooses my food and leaves me with nothing.\n\nI guess he'd better start cooking his own meals then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Because obviously her kids and husband like meat....otherwise I'm sure they would vocalize that they are vegetarian too.", "Yeah if he had just sent the pizza, I would have guessed lazy. \n\n\nEither way, he doesn't like OP enough to respect her.", "He said he made a sandwich....I question whether he really did though.", ">piece of a husband.\n\n\nTypo?", "That\u2019s not gaslighting. Gaslighting would be: I didn\u2019t touch your food. You must have eaten it yourself. He is being emotionally manipulative. Not the same thing.", "[deleted]", "> I guess he'd better start cooking his own meals then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBe careful.  \n\n - he's already been isolating you from your friends \n - he's been cutting you off from food \n - he's been trying to guilt you for wanting ***food*** \n - he likely cut you off from financials since you're calling him \"partner\" not \"husband\"\n - he makes you clean up after him and his friends even though your friends aren't allowed to come over \n - you're isolated from your family \n\nWhen you put your foot down, he has all the signs of someone that could react violently.  All the above are red flags for abusers.", "At this point, I'd begin to wonder, since they seem to be eating her stuff and leaving her the meat.  At some point, it's tough luck for OP's partner;  I could understand that the kids might be able to make an argument that they shouldn't have to 'suffer' with vegetarian food.\n\n(In the US, most of us eat way more meat than we need, nutritionally.  This sounds like the UK, but I presume the situation is similar, so the kids are unlikely to actually suffer physically from eating vegetarian food at home.)", "He certainly isn't a full husband.", "I'd say he's missing a few key pieces of a fully functional husband.", "I think it is gaslighting because he is lying to her about that he\u2019s padding the daughters lunch.", "They're not wrong though", "More the ass parts, really.", "That's still not gaslighting."]}
