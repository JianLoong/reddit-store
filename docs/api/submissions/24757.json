I was going to give extra to help pay for the seat if I did bring my partner because that's how it is in some cultures but I was confused about why the price was different.\n\nSome commenters pointed out that there could be extra fees and add-ons so that could be why. Also that it was in poor taste of me to look into the wedding venue, ask for a plus one, and look at the prices so I'm sorry for doing that and I won't bring the pricing up to the groom because I don't want to offend him more.\n\nSome of my Asian friends I know have 'made a profit' from their weddings because people gifted more so it can be a cultural thing.", "created_utc": 1692164880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sgx1f/aita_if_i_asked_my_friend_about_the_wedding_guest/", "score": 868, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

WTF?!  An invitation is not an obligation.  Decline.  If your friend can't afford to throw a wedding, then he should get married in a courthouse and have a modest gathering within his means.

Is this normal?? NTA", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like they really want guests there for it\u2019s own sake if they\u2019re demanding cash to be able to enter. The normal etiquette at least where I\u2019m from is that the guests are socially expected to give a wedding present, which can be cash but it\u2019s not like a charge of a specific amount to enter the venue. TBH, unless I was really close to this person, I wouldn\u2019t attend if that\u2019s how transactional they want to make the wedding. With the way they set it up, it sounds more like a profit seeking business activity rather than a wedding.", "Nta. It\u2019s not your job to pay for your friends wedding; asking for a monetary gift instead of a tangible gift is fine, asking for a specific amount that is quite a lot to cover the wedding is not fine. It\u2019s their choice to have the wedding at that location not yours", "Wait, wait, wait. They are charging $300 per person for guests to attend their wedding? WTF? Is this a thing?\n\nI think your friend is the AH for selling tickets to their wedding. You'd be one, too, if you went along with this shit show and inquired about the cost to bring a date. Don't ask, don't attend the wedding.", "This isn't how weddings work.  You don't charge a cover to get in.  It's not a club, it's an event that the bride and groom are hosting.  The guests aren't there to cover the cost and turn a nice profit, they're supposed to be there to celebrate the bride and groom, because they're people who are important to the couple.  Yes, it's customary to give a gift that will offset the food that you're eating and the cost of the wedding, but what your friend is doing is not that at all.  I would feel no obligation to be there... I don't think he wants you there for the 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to see him get married... I think he wants you there for the sweet 600 dollars you and your partner will net him.

If the invitation doesn\u2019t specify a +1, it\u2019s kinda rude to ask if you can bring one because if the couple wanted you to bring one, they would have said so. \n\n2 - it\u2019s an invitation, not a summons so however you know the bride/groom/couple and however far back the relationship goes, you are not obliged to attend. \n\n3 - asking guests to pay for their place at the wedding is ridiculous.

Not only do this pair of parasites want their guests to pay for their wedding, it sounds like they want to make a profit off of them. And of course he's insisting you attend, you and all his other guests are how he's planning on funding this \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\". Also, given the fact that people get married every day it's hardly a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity now, is it? You will attend plenty of other weddings, you may even attend more weddings for this pair (when no longer a pair of course).\n\nThese people are not your friends and you shouldn't be gaslit into paying for their party.", "NTA but What the hell??? I understand not wanting to pay for plus ones, and usually the invites say, no guests. And for example you and your college mates would be sharing a table, and perhaps have a plus one at the evening.\n\nThat I get.

That\u2019s so trashy. \n\nI\u2019m married and I\u2019d have been shocked if anyone would have given me that much!", "Since charging guests to attend a wedding is absolutely unspeakable,  I suggest that you never speak of it & simply decline the invitation. \n\nYou are NOT obligated to shell out 300 or 600 dollars (plus whatever expenses are involved in getting there) just because they planned a wedding they couldn't afford to host.\n\nAnd it's not a \"once in a lifetime opportunity \", though if I'm spending 300 per seat for a chance to dress up, mingle and eat (at best) deeply average food, it's because I chose to attend a fundraiser for a *charity* I actually want to support.", "NTA but oh my god this is bizarre. This is not how weddings work. You are inviting people to a party that you are hosting. Hopefully you stayed within your budget and you get some generous gifts from your guests - I think it\u2019s fine to ask for cash only but I have never heard of thing so tacky as requiring a minimum gift. $250/pp is outrageous. Mine was $85/pp including the open bar.", "NTA. But it is extremely rude to invite people to essentially a party you cannot afford, then make them subsidize your event. That\u2019s crazy. Make yourself unavailable. He\u2019s badgering you because no one else is RSVPing yes either.", "I mean, i don't doubt that they are paying 300 per person on average. Weddings are expensive, and everything adds up (dress, flowers, decor, cake, etc).\n\nRequiring an attendance fee is so tacky though. I wouldn't go to a wedding where I was expecting to pay a certain amount. Besides, they could have chosen a cheaper place.\n\nNTA", " YWBTA if you asked, but your \"friend\" is greedy & tacky.

Just don't attend if you're uncomfortable.", "It's possible that they are having add-ons and such - very common for venues to offer upgrades.  Plus taxes, fees, etc.  It seems pretty credible that the real number is closer to $300 (although maybe you're paying for the bride's dress at that point?)  \n\n\nDon't ask though.  You want to ask because you know this policy is utter nonsense, and you were already feeling taken advantage of, which is true, this is a ridiculous way to throw a wedding.  Just spend $600 on something with your partner that doesn't suck...", "Yes YTA if you ask.\n\nYour other option is to just not go, if you don't want to pay the fee. \"Oh sorry actually something came up, sorry!\" You don't have to try and argue with them about it", "YTA\n\nYour friend is laying out the conditions to his wedding. You gain nothing by asking for the details on the pricing at all, and it's not like you're going to negotiate the fee.\n\nBut honestly, your friend is asking for a cover charge so he can have his wedding for free. Why are you even going? Just buy him a $100 gift and use the $500 you're saving on a nice romantic night for two.", "YTA It's kinda cringe to expect guests to pay a cover charge but that's their choice. Your options are go or not go, simple.", "Why do you feel like you can't ask about the 250-300 $ per head quote?\n\nI agree that people shouldn't have to pay to attend a wedding, buuuut I also don't think it's totally unfair. Maybe instead of gifts they decided it would be better to try and offset the cost of the wedding - Kind of like inviting everyone to a big dinner but splitting the check. Maybe the extra 50 bucks is some sort of tip or 'inconvenience' charge for the people providing the service.\n\nThis feels different from those wedding couples who ask for hundreds or thousands of $$$ to pay for their honeymoon or for the entire venue and extravagant hotel rooms and flight tickets etc. That is entitled for sure. At least your 250 is going towards having a good time with your friend, I am assuming.\n\nIf you feel like it's too much, you could politely decline the invite and say you will give them a gift of your own choosing  (or none at all)", "NAH but kinda random because what about photographer, videographer, DJ, live band, MC etc etc etc. even sending out invites cost money.\n\nwow the responses are so weird. its standard to give money at a wedding reception and its usually pegged to the prestige/cost of the venue. disgusts me all these people who go to weddings and eat and drink but think of giving nothing back.\n\nthere are even lists published annually for estimated price of each venue. having a fee might be because theres been too many freeloaders/golddiggers like in this thread recently.", "YWBTA. It is their wedding and you don't have to attend or bring your partner if you don't want to. But asking about the price will get everyone on edge and will make you look cheap. As if the only thing you are consern is money.\n\nIs it odd. Yes. But I would think it is also odd to ask if you are allowed to bring a partner, if they weren't invited in the first place (but this depends on the size of the wedding party I think)\n\nJust think for yourself if it is worth 300 $ to bring your partner and if you want to spend $300 for yourself there because you want to be there for your friend.

Instead, decide if you do or don\u2019t want to pay $300 to attend a wedding.  A nice dinner out at a very nice venue usually costs $100 per person, not $300.  Is this wedding worth parting ways with $300?  Then send the RSVP back.  If you\u2019re not going, send a card with congrats on the wedding, hope you have a great day, super life together, etc.  End with \u201cper your request, no gift enclosed\u201d to explain lack of gift.\n\n Maybe it\u2019s just me but $300 per person is A LOT of money to spend on a wedding.  But hey, if that\u2019s what a couple wants to spend on a wedding then sure they should do that.  They should invite friends and family that they feel are worthy of the cost associated with inviting the person.
