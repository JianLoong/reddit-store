Recently B has been asking us for a gaming room as well. I explained to her that it's not possible because we don't have another spare room to give her. She then insisted I let her use C's gaming room and console. I kindly explained to her that those are his belongings and if he doesn't want to let her use them then she can't use them. I suggested we do something else for her birthday like we could go out for dinner or something like that but she started yelling at me and ran to her room crying.

My husband\u2019s parents treat him this same way and we barely speak to them, we don\u2019t spend most holidays with them, they are an obligation and a source of stress, and he will likely breathe a giant sigh of relief when they die.

If your son owns the console I agree it's he who decides whether she uses it or not. But she does deserve joint use of the room.

Are you sure you\u2019re not a 16 year old boy who\u2019s having a falling out with his Sister? \n\nEither way, YTA. No question", "I've always shared my consoles and computers with my little brother. What's the big issue? The console should belong to the family. Stop favoring one kid over the other, this is why they don't get alon.", "Does he have unlimited screen time?  No reason she can't use it when he isn't...", "Wtf. I\u2019ve grown up sharing my console with my sibling. It\u2019s strange you think ONE person can use a console (with the exception of the switch; my sibling and I have separate switches lol). It\u2019s like using the TV. Does someone claim ownership of using the TV and no one else is allowed to watch? \ud83d\ude02", "Enjoy the last few years you get to see your daughter. The lengths you're going to in order to ensure she isn't treated fairly is wild. Your kid is picking up on all this whether you realize it or not. It's going to affect your relationship for the rest of your life.", "My sister and I shared gaming consoles until we had jobs to afford our own individual consoles. \n\nJust admit it. You love your son more. \n\nYTA", "Even if it has an owner, your son should share.\n\nMy little brother wanted a PS4 when it came out, although it was pricy, my dad managed to get it for him, but we all play on it. Even if he requested it. This is how we have been through the years. Your kids need to learn to play together and share with each other. This will foster good relationship between them.", "Every single gaming console in my house growing up was a shared console because they are so expensive. If you can\u2019t afford to spend equal amount of money on both kids, don\u2019t give one kid an expensive gift. \n\nHonestly C should have a room or an expensive gift. It\u2019s clear here that C is the golden child.", "Me and my siblings only had one console but we sorted it between us that we each get a few hours a day on it each. Sounds like you love your son more than your daughter I feel so bad for her", "It\u2019s called sharing and you as the parent make that rule. Or you figure out a way to get your daughter her own.", "Do you know how much I had to share with my little sister? Dang near everything. And I don't have resentment because that's just the way it was and was fair to both of us. Nothing is going to change or get better until you admit you play favorites", "Why give everything to one kid? \n\nI have a son and daughter same age difference.  We get the console as a family gift, then games as individual gifts.\n\nMy son built a gaming pc WITH HIS OWN MONEY and my help. It is in his room, and he 100% invites his sister to use i when he isn't.   He also set it up as a server to boost her laptop so they can play together with mods. My kids like each other and show up for each other. \n\nYou messed up.  Work with your husband to fix it.  If this was something life threatening for your son you would find the money.", "Well if he doesn\u2019t like sharing make him work so he can buy it from you", "Ah I missed the \"a few years ago\" OP you're such an AH", "With every comment you make you sound like a bigger asshole.\n\nI feel so bad for your daughter.\n\nThe whole 'older kids get more privelige' is bs and you know it.\n\nIts so obvious how u favor your son and dont care about your daughter", "Your kids don't get along because you clearly favor your son over your daughter, and that leads to tension.", "How you are asking this and not realizing how big of a YTA you are is appalling. Buy her a used one and set up a corner in her bedroom or half of the existing game room. To expect one child to wait until the other sibling moves out to be treated equally is the biggest load of BS I've seen in a long while. You created the situation, figure out what you need to sell of YOURS to make it right. Welcome to parenthood.", "Then she gets the biggest room in the house so she can have a personal gaming corner in it. You need to match your energy for both kids and start making B feel you value her the same as her brother", "Of course they don\u2019t get along. Sounds like you e been breeding resentment for a long time by favouring your son over your daughter. Stop being a shitty parent and they might get along better.", "You're showing clear favoritism for your son. There's no such thing as \"older siblings get more privileges,\" you simply made a short-sighted decision to give your son something you can't possibly give your daughter as well, and she knows this. You may feel like it's justified, but your daughter doesn't, and she's right. This is the stuff that makes children go no contact with their parents, so if you feel like never talking to your daughter is worth feeling right, keep doing what you're doing. \n\nEveryone here is saying YTA, why do you keep defending your position? Did you actually come here to get an objective answer, or did you just think you were right and thought we'd all agree? The verdict is unanimously YTA, take it or leave it.", "This would be a good opportunity to give her some responsibility and teach her how to take care of more expensive things. 13 year olds are pretty tech savvy these days. Unless she has a history of breaking things that just sounds like an excuse. You\u2019re letting your son be selfish and teaching your daughter her wants come second. YTA", "So why don't you buy her a separate console and set it up in the room? That way, everyone has their own so they're only using the same set up.", "I wonder do they not get along because of this favoritism you're showing for your son. Because as a younger sibling I have so much trauma around not letting myself have nice things because I don't deserve them. That's the lesson my father taught me. Guess what? I no longer speak to him so he has missed out on meeting and getting to know my now fiance. He missed me getting engaged. He will miss out on the wedding. And he will miss out on any kids we may have. Is that what you want for your future?", "INFO: did you buy the gaming console or did your son? \n\nNo matter how you slice this, you\u2019re exhibiting clear favoritism here. Your daughter gets nothing while your son gets a whole ass room for gaming. That you likely funded and certainly allotted space for. Siblings SHARE. It\u2019s pretty normal, especially if he didn\u2019t buy any of the gaming equipment and it\u2019s not in someone\u2019s private bedroom. Your daughter deserves better than a single dinner out.", "Your kids don't get along? Well who could've possibly guessed? Ever considered that your unequal treatment of them might have contributed to their bad relationship?", "Yeah it would be so different if the son got his consoles at 13, but\u2013oh. Oh wait. Damn.\n\nSuper crazy how you have birthed literally the only human being on the planet who wouldn\u2019t break a console at age 13. So wild that you haven\u2019t gotten him a plaque for it. /s\n\nIf your shitty son can manage to last multiple years with his own consoles and not break them, how little do you even like your daughter that you can\u2019t even give her the chance to show you she\u2019s capable of having her own? You show how much you suck every time you open your mouth. You are an asshole. \n\nIt blows my mind that people like you exist and willingly procreate. Genuinely so saddening. I feel so bad for your daughter\n\n\nOh hey by the way!!! Do you know how women turn their sons into rapists, domestic abusers, and genuinely bad people? Exactly like this. By treating them like little emperors in their own fucking home. Look forward to posting your son\u2019s bail in the future and not even having a daughter to talk to about it. She\u2019ll have abandoned this shitty family long ago.", "Your daughter is 13 years old, NOT 3!  You sound even more awful with every comment you make.  I wouldn't be surprised if your daughter goes NC with you when she gets older.", "They probably don't get along because you seem to draw battle lines between them.", "If she breaks the console you might have reasonable grounds for restrictions.  \n\nIf she gets no chance to prove she can be in the room without taking a sledgehammer to the games, then you're favoritism is blatantly showing.", "Stop babying your son. Kids learn to share in kindergarten. Your son needs to grow up. Your job as a parent is to give them those kinds of lessons. You are failing BOTH of your children.", "They don\u2019t get along because of you and your husband favoring your son! You need to start being fair to your daughter.", "Geeze, what is wrong with you. 6 year Olds are competent enough not to break things. You're raisi G your son to be TA like your self. Split the room and put a small desk and gaming computer or something, there no room so small it can't accommodate both children, unless you're talking about a small closet, in which case you'd be the bigger Ahole", "Info: are they both your biological kids?", "Gee, I wonder why your kids don\u2019t get along. What a mystery!", "Gee I wonder why they don't get along.\n\n\nMaybe because it's clear who is daddy's and mommy's favorite.", "Maybe they don't get along because you love him more...", "After reading all your comments, I can't possibly imagine WHY they don't get along! Surely it's not a parenting issue!", "Easy answer is she gets her own console, and she gets the new one. Do NOT give your son the new and her the hand me down, that would be bullshit", "Families share consoles. It\u2019s not a big deal. Quit pretending like it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s not.", "You are speaking to my point.  Expectations are set when the gift is given.  I agree about the distinction.  I was just saying it can go different ways depending on the household, situation, and item.", "I'm going to repeat one last time to please read my entire comment. It answers your question. As it says. TA for offering dinner as it's not near in equivalentcy. But NTA for not making him share. You all sound like cry babies because someone has something you should be aloud the same thing. Life is not fair. Also teaching children patience and uniqueness to be their own person is healthy. As I stated above sometimes children just copy Thier older siblings from JEALOUSLY. She deserves something special. But not make that boy share or take away shit because she's throwing a fit. Time for OP to get creative", "Apparently not because he 100% agrees with this awful guardian by the post...", "Older kids get more privileges at a point in time, usually marked by age. The general expectation is that once each child hits that age, their privileges end up matching. E.g. game console at 13, phone at 16 etc. \n\nOP sounds like she just expects to keep lumping privileges on her son and telling her daughter \"too bad, you were born second\"", "I know you\u2019re very right, but the \u201cphone at 16\u201d thing seems a little late in the game, even as an example lol."]}
