I had mentioned that I was not looking for anything serious and was looking for FWBs. She said she was cool with that, just no ONSs. \n\nWe arranged to meet at the train station, we\u2019d ride to the bar and then back to my house. The date itself was fine, we had a drink or two, we were chatting, having fun\u2026 until the kiss. We were outside safe from the rain, not many people around, the mood was set. But as soon as we started kissing, she would not let go of me. Physically would not let me pull away, she was simultaneously pulling my neck towards her, while driving her face into mine. It was uncomfortable and a bit painful. I tried to pull away multiple times, but she just would not let me go. I had to move my head out of her reach before I could get her to stop. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, but I did try to guide her, tell her to go slower, softer. It would work for about 30 secs before she went back to it. Probably should have stopped the date there, but I just tried to ignore it and convince myself that it would get better as the night went on (it did not). \n\nFast forward to back at my house, the sex part of the date, and it\u2019s just truly bad. It was pretty clear to me that she was a virgin (she confirmed this later), and while I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that, I do think it\u2019s an important thing to mention. Especially when you are sleeping with a near perfect stranger. It wasn\u2019t just that the actual sex was off, but I could tell she was holding back from communicating. It was clear at times that she was feeling uncomfortable, but would tell me otherwise, and then appear visibly better once I stopped anyway. The whole situation was just really stressful, and I really did not want to end up hurting this girl, so we stopped and went to bed. \n\nShe seemed to have enjoyed the night and was pretty happy the next morning. The aggressive kissing ensued, but I eventually dropped her off at the train station.\n\n By then, I was absolutely sure I did not want to see this girl again. On one hand, I was a bit upset that she didn\u2019t tell me that she was a virgin. I would not have slept with her if I\u2019d known, it\u2019s just not something I\u2019m comfortable doing. I know I\u2019m not owed that info, but idk it seems like the kind of thing you should tell your first sex partner. But at the same time, the last thing I wanted was to ruin this experience for her, she seemed like she\u2019d had a good time and I didn\u2019t wanna take that away from her. So I lied. \n\n2 days after our date, I told her I had run into my ex and we\u2019d reconnected, and that I was sorry but I wouldn\u2019t be able to see her anymore. She left me on read and blocked me. Ik it was a dick move, but what could I say?

And though it was her decision not to tell you this was her first time, still. You were clear from the start and I think many men wouldn't be as considerate.\nYou did lie, but it was a diplomatic lie. You didn't want to hurt her, or at least, not as much as you could have by telling her the truth.\nNot everyone is compatible.", "NTA. I think all the backstory isn't really necessary and could be really summed up with \"AITA for telling a white lie? Didn't truly vibe with my tinder date and rather than hurting her by saying this, I made up a reconnection with my ex\".

That's a mutual decision.", "ESH.  \n\n\nNeither of you communicated the important part. She was uncomfortable during sex yet she didn't say anything and she was expecting something more from that.  \n\n\nYou were uncomfortable yet you continued the date. Discussions like that are awkward that's true but they are necessary so rest of the date doesn't go horribly wrong and you both know what to expect. In worst case the discussion can save you both from horrible feeling because you can cut it off before anything serious happens.", "YTA.\n\nNot for how you left things off, that text was probably the least hurtful way to cut things off so no harm there.\n\nYTA for sleeping with her after that nightmare kiss. You had to know it wasn't going to be a repeat thing at that point, and she had been upfront about not wanting a ONS. \n\nThink with your other head sooner, next time.", "INFO how old were both of you? (I'm very curious)", "YTA. You had sex with someone you had absolutely no chemistry with physically or emotionally. You ought to have more respect for your own body and women as something more than a blowup doll. It\u2019s one thing to hit it off and have sex but this was all wrong from the jump.", "YTA. You say you felt off from the first kiss but kept going. Why? \n\nYou wanted one thing out of this and no matter how bad you said it was you continued to go with it rather then end it sooner.", "The fact that you took her home after it was already going bad tells me it wasn't going bad enough for you to stop as you clearly took her home. Then you said all that. That makes it look like you just wanted to use her and didn't care about her mental state. The best thing you could have done was communicate and tell her you don't like how it's going. Also I'm not against hooking up but people still need to have conversations about sexual and mental health before doing so. Your defiantly in the wrong. You might have really ruined an important moment by making her feel used. I still think she shouod tell yoi if she where a virgin. That to me is important. If you ever speak with her again apologize but also quit going further if it supposedly aint good.", "Yta for sleeping with someone when u knew you didnt even like kissing them. You sound like a user. Its not your fault she didnt tell you she was a virgin but her lack of experience was obvious.", "[deleted]", "YTA, why not speak with her?

You brought her home to your house to sleep with her, even though you had a good sense that you weren\u2019t interested in seeing her again and that she was likely more interested in you than you were in her. Sex was on the table, though, so might as well get it in!\n\nYou\u2019re focusing on the fact that you didn\u2019t know she was a virgin. Why? Because you would have acted differently, because you already knew you weren\u2019t interested in seeing her again. Because you understand that not everyone views sex as casually as you do, even if they say they will, and that you should exercise judgment and restraint so you don\u2019t end up hurting someone.\n\nWould challenge you to apply that thinking consistently.", "YTA. Once you found out she was a virgin you basically pushed her away. You could have had a lot of fun with her, finding out what she likes and she could have found what you like. Instead, you just lie to her.", "Por", "YTA and you know it.   She was a virgin.  She needs to learn, and it sounds like you do too, to communicate.  Lying is never the best solution. Just the easiest.", "YTA you could have taught her so much and made her more confident. I would suspect every virgin would find it overwhelming. If everything else went fine it was your job to teach her, make her confident.", "NTA. She should have told you it was her first time at least that way you could have prepared and found a way to make it more enjoyable for her.", "No, she didn\u2019t tell you and you were not interested. You\u2019re allowed to leave a romantic connection if you are not. If you knew and took advantage of her inexperience, then you\u2019d be an asshole. It\u2019s not your fault. Maybe in the future if you find yourself single you can make it a point to bring up these things like \u201coh I\u2019m tested and I don\u2019t have stis, how about you?\u201d And it will come up natural if they are a virgin. People have these talks before sex all the time.\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nPeople are to concerned about not telling white lies to strangers. .\n\nDoes it hurt anyone to tell her this? No. \n\nDoes it matter that you lied? No.\n\nIt saved her feelings. She's not looking for a review of how she did, and telling her that you don't want a second date because she's a bad lay would hurt more.", "NTA these things go fast and are difficult to handle. I would have told her honestly in person what you just described here.  \nAltho something similar happened to me and I tried to see the girl in person but she sensed the mood and ghosted me.\n\nShe's NTA either, she is just unexperienced. Altho blocking and ghosting to me are real asshole moves from a human point of view, I accept that from a person with hurt feelings", "NTA. Odds are you will never see her again either way, and you were trying to let her down gently in a way that would ensure she'd never ask about a second date.", "ESH. She was not disclosing relevant info for you and was bad at communicating what she wants and needs, which lead to a lot of strange events. That makes her a slight AH.\n\nHowever, you immediately felt there was something off, went through with continuing the date anyway (why?) and then ignored the only thing she actually communicated about: not wanting to have a ONS. Makes you an AH as well.\n\nStill, this is sometimes how dating goes. Just stop a date if something feels off. For some people the chemistry just isn\u2019t there and that\u2019s okay. When you stop communicating however, that\u2019s where the problems and the (white) lies begin and that is AH territory.", "I wonder a little. I wonder how we lost the urge to communicate when we can see the other person lacks that skill or confidence.\nYou saw she was uncomfortable which is awesome. Many people cant read the other person being uncomfortable they just want to nut\u2026 i wonder if you could have taken the initiative and say lets pause and just talk for a moment, maybe open the dialogue for her to feel confident enough to say something or ask for help. She was a virgin, she probably had 0 knowledge of kissing wrong, she may have seen it on tv or something and thought that was how its done, and nobody ever told her, and probably started avoiding her, hence she said no ONSs. Her not telling you shes uncomfortable as she may fear you reject her, after all, she had 0 experience.\n\nNTA, you acted very courteously. I do not fault you.", "NTA. Sounds like you made your intentions clear from the start. I think she thought she could trick you into being in a relationship. It's crazy how the chick just gave away her V-card to a complete stranger. If it was that unimportant she could have at least sold it and got a quick bag.", "def doesn't owe him her history but IMO for her own safety and comfort she should have told him. too many guys are rough on women their first times and it can do damage", "Yea. That\u2019s pretty true actually", "Yep, especially since she already mentioned she didn't want a ONS, you should've known from the kissing part that you wouldn't become FWB.

Truth is, I probably should\u2019ve, just didn\u2019t know how.", "That\u2019s a fair point. I am not a great communicator when it comes to these types of situations, I was unsure how to proceed with any comment about her sexual performance or kissing that would not have been hurtful to hear, especially on her first time. \n\nWhile I was uncomfortable, I\u2019m an adult with a good amount of experience and if at any point I felt violated or wanted to end the situation I could have done it. I mostly stuck it out to preserve her feelings and experience.", "I have absolutely no interest in engaging in casual sex with virgins. On the contrary, I seek out promiscuous partners, so that I know I have an experienced partner who knows what they\u2019re doing and is also able to properly communicate with me throughout the encounter.\n\nLying might have been a mistake, but breaking it off certainly wasn\u2019t.", "So it would have been better if he\u2019d said \u201cyou should have told me you were a virgin.

It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s job to do that. This girl decided to withhold very important information from her date. She also chose to lose her virginity to someone she did not know at all and had only met a few hours before. That\u2019s her choice, but in my opinion it was a poor one. \n\nNo one is obligated to continue sleeping with you or to show you things or anything of that kind if they aren\u2019t interested.", "My intentions for going out with her was to have good sex and a good date. I had neither. \n\nI have no interest in making her more confident or teaching her anything, and it certainly is not my job to do so.", "The OP didn\u2019t want a partner just some casual sex which was clearly communicated. Staying around for a while teaching her would have lead to a relationship", "I completely disagree. It's no one's job to teach someone else how to be intimate unless it's something they *want* to do. Clearly, OP did not.", "You say you had a great night and take her to the train. You clearly have no problem lying to her but only after you might have sex", "Best way to preserve anyone's feelings is asking, I would have asked if she was OK before giving advice, being the experienced one I would try to make her comfortable and provide her advice, if she was a virgin, do you know if you were the first she guy she kissed?", "Ok but you kept trying to have sex after you found out so in the moment casual sex with a virgin wad fine?", "There are constructive ways to have the convo.", "While I agree that it isn't OP's job to teach her anything, she also said she didn't want ONS. OP already felt bad about the date before they had sex. He should've stopped it before they even had sex, whether she was a virgin or not.", "He clearly didn\u2019t though? He broke off contact almost immediately, are your reading skills okay? Hit your head?  He just finished the act and that\u2019s it. He would have made her feel much worse if he just stopped immediately.", "I get what you\u2019re saying. Of course it\u2019s gonna be bad if she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing, we\u2019ve all been there once, and we\u2019ve all had to learn and there\u2019s no shame in that. \n\nI don\u2019t judge her for being inexperienced, I don\u2019t. However that is just not the kind of partner I am looking for. And after being on one date with her, I am not the right person to tell her the way in which she should have sex before never seeing her again.", "Sure, but they all lead to the same conclusion. I don\u2019t think this woman was emotionally ready for the situation she put herself in. She should have readied herself for a ONS and gone from there, rather than thinking she could withhold important info and then continue to have a casual sexual relationship.", "Sure I don\u2019t agree but let\u2019s pretend you make a good point. He\u2019s  still the asshole for lying.  You think being lied to after the first time with a pretty lame lie is going to be good for her than being honest and having a constructive convo?"]}
