If this dysfunctional behaviour really is within niece's control, then there's no reason for you to subject yourself to it during a holiday. It sounds exhausting.", "NTA - my sister-in-law is a middle school teacher and she has seen over 60 students in the past year claim to have turrets. Something going on in TikTok has kids thinking turrets is cool. If she can sit through a whole ass movie without a single tik then its probably being done for attention.", "NTA.  \n\n\nA lot of kids who are on tik tok seem to think it's \"cool\" to have tourettes.  She sounds like them.    \n\n\nThe only way you would be TA is if you indulged her.", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot if emerging research about social media resulting in the imitation of tics (TicTok) - which then become permanent. I\u2019d ask her if she wants to be stuck with this forever\u2026because she might be training her brain to do just that.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s your trip. You decide who comes. If she suddenly broke her leg in an accident, she\u2019s not coming then either because she\u2019d couldn\u2019t ride any rides.\n\nTell her she has a medical condition that now requires her to be home.", "NTA. Oh God. Knew a few people who did this back in middle and high school, and one who still does it in college. Tourettes isn't common at all, and to be honest it's pretty easy to tell when it's faked. SOME people can partially suppress tics for short periods of time, but it's not perfect and for the large part they're wildly uncontrollable. It's especially uncommon for it to come out of the blue at this age, manifest like that, and only happen when she's not otherwise engaged with something more interesting that she doesn't want the inconvenience of having her body interrupt. \n\nShe almost definitely doesn't have tics, you're correct. Seen this same thing through multiple different kids, though all had issues where their parents paid them little to no attention. It's annoying and insulting, but you should also check and see if there's any underlying cause for her to be acting like this. Most likely it's just her young teenage self being stupid and wanting more attention, but its possible it's a sign of something deeper. Either way, NTA that you don't want her imposing on a family trip.", "NTA. This whole word trend of kids faking disorders they saw on tiktok is infuriating.", "So, let me first start off by saying there are different types of tics, which in and of itself, is not specific to Tourette\u2019s (neurological disorder). Some tics, like with a motor tic disorder, can be \u2018psychological\u2019 in that they are not a result of neurological damage/impairment, but rather surface due to psychological factors, like stress, anxiety, etc. Psychological tics, differentiated by the person\u2019s ability to suppress the tics if they concentrate enough to do so, can be safely treated with medication. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like Ashley may have read about the symptoms of Tourette\u2019s and took it to the extreme. HOWEVER, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she has no tic disorder.\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\nI have motor tic disorder. It started when I was in 3rd grade, around age 7. The manifestations would change (e.g. vocal tics, muscular tics/twitches, joint popping, rolling eyes, etc.), but there was a time in my life when all symptoms hit at once, after my mom\u2019s life-threatening car accident. \n\nI mention this because at first, I used to think I had Tourette\u2019s, since no one ever heard about psychological tics, and many of my symptoms are the same. But the difference was that when I was distracted, focused on something, deep in non-stressful conversation, or tried hard enough to hide/suppress them, I wouldn\u2019t have them.\n\nSO, I feel Ashley probably doesn\u2019t have Tourette\u2019s, unless she very coincidentally has an extreme case of it. But don\u2019t discredit her just yet. \n\nI had to be seen by three specialists before my disorder was identified/diagnosed\u2014 a neurologist, a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I\u2019d recommend having her seen by the latter.\n\nWhy?\n\nIf she does in fact have psychological tics, like I do, and you\u2019re only seeing her when she\u2019s suppressing them (I did this a lot out of fear of embarrassment), depending on the actual severity of her alleged condition, they might actually be quite treatable by very low dose psychotropic medication, which only a psychiatrist can prescribe and would be better able to determine if medication would be effective/appropriate for Ashley\u2019s potential condition (since she\u2019s still an adolescent).\n\nIn my case, until there was a global medication shortage, I used to take 1 mg of the anti-psychotic medication Haloperidol (Haldol). Not for psychosis, but because it was found to negate motor tics, and it worked like a charm. \n\nI eventually had to switch medications almost a decade later, due to the shortage, but point being, if she actually does suffer from tics, a psychiatrist may be better equipped to treat her.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, though. Your concerns about the airport do seem valid. Just for future reference, though, you could always have her registered with TSA as a PreCheck flyer. It\u2019s a bit of a process, but it would make the security check-in process much quicker.\n\n#NTA", "Hey OP, I'm going to go with NTA here, and let me break down why.\n\nFirst of all, kudos for trying to make an informed decision by researching and observing Ashley's behavior. It's clear you care about her, and you're trying to do what's best for everyone involved.\n\nYou're not obligated to take someone on vacation if their behavior is disruptive or upsetting, especially when it seems that the behavior might not be genuine. It's important to remember that your sister and Ashley's doctor are also skeptical about the situation. While Ashley might be going through a rough patch, it's essential to set boundaries and consequences for her actions, because, let's face it, the world won't always be as understanding as you are!\n\nHaving a frank conversation with Ashley and her mom about your concerns is a good first step. They might not be thrilled with your stance, but it could be the wake-up call Ashley needs to address whatever is really going on.\n\nSo, stand your ground, OP. You're looking out for everyone's best interests, including Ashley's, and that makes you NTA. Good luck and happy theme park-ing!", "NTA she doesn't have Tourretes, she has TikTokitis. There's some bizarre trend going on of teens thinking it is a. hilarious and b. a free ticket for being a rude jerk.\n\nShe would better spend the time you are away with her siblings volunteering with real Tourretes patients.", "NTA. Whether you believe she can control it or not, she isn't well enough to go on a trip and it will be super annoying for you too. She needs to stay home and get treatment asap.", "Hey, *your* trip? You can take who you want to take. If decorum and good behavior don\u2019t look like they will be observed by the potential participants? Then somebody can get left at home to hopefully have a productive relationship with their therapist. \n\nNTA and I hope you have an excellent trip.", "NTA- obviously she's acting out, why, who knows?  it's not your job to find out or to fix it.  I'm sorta surprised her parents let it go on this long.  my father would have beat the hell out of me had i acted like this, but then i'm a guy, and from a time fathers wouldn't spare the rod.  hell i remember my grandmother spanking the stuffing out of my 12yo cousin (also a boy) because he cussed, she actually chased him down, tackled him and spanked his ass raw in front of the family.  He never cussed in her presence again.  turnout out to be an upstanding honor student with a wife and kid (frankly he turned out better then i did).\n\nObviously I'm not saying it's time to switch the foolishness out of your niece, but i think her parents are making this worse by not putting their foot down.  your sister is spoiling her girl, and turning her into a monster, and someone had to draw a line in the sand on this.  if her sister doesn't like it, she can either not go, and let the child continue to act out, or figure out an appropriate way to end this nonsense.  (if it were me the cell phone would have been the first thing to go)", "NTA. If everyone genuinely believes she is faking it.

Too much emotions (even good ones) make symptoms worse. Is she ok with this happening in public? If she is, it may end up in bad mood and again worsen the symptoms. I think you and her mom, as an adults who knows her best, should consider everything and choose what is the best for her. Not going might be better.", "NTA at all.", "NTA. Whatever is going on with Ashley needs to be figured out before taking her on any trips.  Especially a plane ride. If she were to have an outburst on the plane without  a diagnosis to justify said behavior it could end up with you being kicked off or banned from  flying. Also it wouldn't be fair to the others girls if Ashley were to continue having the tics/outburst throughout the trip. It couls negatively impact the quality of the experience for everyone. Also there is a safety  concern  if she is being rude to others during these outburst. \nNot everyone is understanding.  Having the outburst with the wrong person could lead to violence. So I wouldn't feel comfortable taking Ashley on a plane trip until there is a proper diagnosis with a treatment plan in place to help mitigate the outburst if they do continue to happen.", "NTA- my cousin went through something similar but he actually has tourettes.

Other symptoms include motor tics which are usually the first symptoms. Tourettes also usually subsides when the person is concentrating (like at the movies) and begins again when their level of concentration is back to normal. It also usually accelerates when someone is excited, so if that was accurate it could be true. \n\nBut if she's only having vocal tics and no motor tics (head jerking, involuntary hand movements, grimacing) she's definitely faking it.  Since it sounds like her and her friend suddenly started having symptoms at the same time, it seems like she could be faking as well.

Not only is she acting out in mean ways, but she's also making fun of a serious psychological disorder that has life altering effects for the people who actually have it. If mom feels like she's faking it, too, then mom needs to sit her daughter down and tell her the repercussions of faking a disorder like this. And yes, she shouldn't be taken to an amusement park if she's acting like this because it's only going to fuel her actions. \n\nBut, in the slightest chance that she's not faking it, you should feel bad for keeping her out of the fun since she can't control it. I do agree that there are techniques that people with tourettes use, but she's so young and new to the disorder that it would be difficult for her to do successfully.

My daughter having nothing else but work to do actually paid attention to her daughter. Unfortunately that was short lived when my daughter got a new boyfriend and once again my granddaughter was shoved to the side. After seeing my daughter was willing to give her literally anyone that would take her, I agreed to keep her permanently. From being passed to different people and not seeing her mother much, she developed a tic. It was a constant Hmm..Hmmm..Hmm.  It never happened at school but did at my place and with both parents. It was louder at both parents. Fortunately being with me stabilized her. Her mother had a son and doesn\u2019t take care of him either. So I have him as well.

NEITHER friend is rude to others. Yes, the one friend curses like you would not believe, and often repeats phrases that could have kind of a sing song-y pattern to them. But neither one is just outright rude or mean. You can obviously tell that they are ticking. The friend with the more severe case always had to have a parent present on field trips for school and when they were out in public with friends because of melt downs, but they weren't mean or violent (yes, they have occasionallyslapped st someone, but mostly if there was clothing that triggered them. Like pom poms on hats or bells on shoes at christmas time, but it was never done with mean intent). There are techniques that people around them can use to help them through the ticks. My kid for the less severe friend would mostly ignore the ticks and continue with whatever conversation they were having, but at a slower pace, and that seems to work for them. With the more severe friend, my kid accidently found out in middle school that singing was a way to break the friends ticks (the friend was having a meltdown in class, and had just came from band, so my kid started singing the last song they played in band). The friend calmed down (but did sing the song the rest of the class). So my kid continued to help that way and they were able to go out places with certain groups without parental supervision (the friend was ok with the singing and the friends therapist said it works with some people, so if it works, use it).\n\nMy younger kid has shown me some of those stupid videos on tik tok with kids obviously faking. It's awful. In a lot of those videos, the kids are just running around places being rude, cussing at others in public, and just being a menace. Parents really need to put their foot down with the crap and teach their kids some compassion. Every time someone acts like an ass because of those videos, it just sets back the progress that the kids who really have it as a whole. It causes the general public to be afraid of them, when really, you just kind of need to have a sense of humor and an easy going attitude around most of the kids with tourettes (I say sense of humor, because yes, you are gonna get cussed at and yes, stuff will get dropped or spilled and if you are too uptight it's just going to cause you and the person with tourettes some discomfort.

I also want to add this context for anyone else reading this here and wondering if they\u2019re dealing with the same / how to talk to their doctors about it. \n\nFirst, \u2018Anxiety Disorder\u2019 is not a diagnosis. There are types of anxiety disorders, and there is one very specifically called \u2018Generalized Anxiety Disorder,\u2019 which presumably is what you\u2019re referring to here.\n\nSecond, GAD does not cause \u2018true\u2019 tics but instead anxiety *twitches.* In particular, the screaming and shouting words you\u2019ve described here sound like tics and not anxiety twitches, which can occur through a co-existing tic disorder, like but not limited to Tourette\u2019s. I can\u2019t know this is the case for you, of course, so I would recommend seeking care and confirmation from a second physician if you haven\u2019t already.\n\n> Anxiety tics or twitches happen when someone experiences involuntary twitching or tension during times of heightened stress or anxiety. These will usually look like muscle spasms throughout the body\u2014specifically around the eyes, arms, legs, neck, or throat\u2014or nervous habits like clenching one\u2019s jaw, twisting or pulling hair, picking at skin, biting fingernails, or grinding teeth.\n\n>Tics, in a more official sense of the word, are actually separate behaviors that occur as a result of tic disorders. Though tics can often look very similar to anxiety twitches, they have different causes. \n\nYou can read this & more [here](https://thriveworks.com/blog/what-are-anxiety-tics-and-how-can-i-treat-them/)", "I also only tic when I'm anxious.

So, school & home, tv, board games, family time. No social outings, no internet, no phone for texts or chats, etc. After 2wks she can go to the park with her friends, say 3x over the course of a week. No tics developed?

It's not that suddenly every teen wants to have a debilitating disorder, just that they suddenly experiences major stressed that caused it. That isn't to say people aren't faking them, just that it's not a widespread issue like the media wants to push.

They are worse when I'm in noisy environments or my mind doesn't have a direct focus (phone, book, task, etc) so what you're observing about the difference between being in the car or the movie vs walking through the mall makes sense. Sometimes they get worse when I am thinking about them, or if I'm somewhere that it's really important I control them. \n\nThey also coincide with my COVID recovery but that might be coincidence - I had them before that, I've had them to some degree as long as I can remember but they were never this intrusive until recently. \n\nI just started a med called guanfacine that works on the adrenaline centre of the brain and while I haven't been on it long enough to say for sure I have high hopes based on testimonials. It's FDA approved for high blood pressure and also ADHD in youth/teens, but used frequently off label for PTSD, and tics. I would definitely suggest that she see someone who is able to prescribe meds - I think they are often misused as a whole solution, but as an element of treatment they can be crucial, especially for functional disorders. \n\nSomething I try and remember on behalf of myself and also people I encounter who I find difficult - even if something is \"all in your head\" there is actually a LOT going on up there, most of which we don't know anything about. There is so much about the brain that is a mystery, and it's connected to every other system in the body. The idea that mental and physical health are so different is strange to me, personally. So much of what we understand about women's health in particular is framed through this idea that people will do things just for attention, and that is bad. (Hysteria, anyone0?) I have often found that when people ask for attention, it's because they need it for a reason, and that's ok! (Doesn't mean you have to give it to them but as a teacher I watched so many authority figures withhold care from teen girls who they decided were attention seeking and it hurts my heart.) i think it's a disservice to the complexity of brains to say that what is happening with teens (in general but specifically girls) and anxiety is just a trend. They are growing into a dying world at war with itself. That's hard, and real. \n\nI also agree that this might mean its not the best time to go on a big stressful trip! Something serious is happening with her health, and that needs focus, space, and time. Years ago I pushed myself through a traumatic episode to be able to go on a work trip and I deeply regret it, still. So framing it as an ultimatum - You Need To Get Over This, Or Else - might end up aggravating the problem. Sounds like she is getting help, I hope it helps!", "A psychiatrist would almost certainly be referred to as a psychiatrist. Therapist could be a psychologist or social worker, but almost certainly not a psychiatrist.\n\nPsychiatry is a higher level degree requiring more education than a therapist or psychologist. Psychiatrists are empowered to prescribe medication, which psychologists, therapists, and social workers are not. (A psychologist may suggest you need medication, and may even have a good idea what type of medication you'll need, but they'd have to refer you to a psychiatrist to officially prescribe it.)\n\nJust FYI. Also, caveat that this is US-based knowledge, so if you're outside the US it's possible the official terminology is different.", "To add onto the really stellar comment above, my brother manifested tics as a young adolescent after developing rheumatic fever and the autoimmune neurological disorder called Sydenham's chorea. The onset of his tics (primarily eye rolling, short vocal tics, and jerky muscle movements) was quick and really alarming. It took a while for him to get diagnosed, and symptoms worsened over time.\n\nCaused by the disorder, the tics in his case were apparently from a blend of neurological and psychiatric responses to his body dealing with the disease. The disease damages the heart and brain, among other things. With treatment (I can't recall exactly what\u2014 I was also young at the time), he improved over three/four months. Has your niece contracted strep throat within the last few months, by any chance? That's often the precursor to rheumatic fever in children. I have no real medical knowledge, but just seems relevant to offer this thought.\n\nBut also... imo, based on the social aspect of your niece's tics, I would agree with leaning more toward a possible psychological root of her actions. That's not to discount it\u2014 the brain is big and complex and an absolute wild ride. Either way, I don't think your family will have a clear answer or solution before your trip in a few weeks. How did she respond when you told her that she might not be able to come on the trip?\n\nNTA if you do end up canceling her invitation, but perhaps take into account other ways to help her feel special and loved in this moment.

A full DSM diagnosis would take time to fulfill all criteria. A provisional tic disorder would be a reasonable working impression. Tourette's is a subset of general tic disorders. In some patients, small motor tics can be present for years (simple eye blinking, grunting, or a hair of throat clearing) and only apparent with recent progression. One catalogs triggers for the tics and situations in which frequency increases. It should not come as a surprise that stress and social stress are common triggers. Tics can even be triggered by suggestion and expectation. One or two consults aren't enough to fully rule in or rule out a Tourette's diagnosis. It's an ongoing management. There is also an association with other disorders such as OCD.", "As you wish. There is no way to prove it without doxing myself, and you're not interested anyway. Good day to you.", "I guess all or most of these replies are from those unfamiliar? My experience is it goes from pediatrician to neurologist to movement disorder specialists and the last does specific referrals: psychiatry for coping behaviors and to handle social shame, psychology for triggers and cognitive or behavioral modifications. We don't know extent or severity so still leery of unnecessary medications.\n\nAnd my main point stand, OP doesn't know the working diagnosis, only what he is told or seeing.\n\nTry to imagine if Ashley Deckard that she was depressed instead.
