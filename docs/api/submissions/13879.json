If this dysfunctional behaviour really is within niece's control, then there's no reason for you to subject yourself to it during a holiday. It sounds exhausting.", "NTA - my sister-in-law is a middle school teacher and she has seen over 60 students in the past year claim to have turrets. Something going on in TikTok has kids thinking turrets is cool. If she can sit through a whole ass movie without a single tik then its probably being done for attention.", "NTA.  \n\n\nA lot of kids who are on tik tok seem to think it's \"cool\" to have tourettes.  She sounds like them.    \n\n\nThe only way you would be TA is if you indulged her.", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot if emerging research about social media resulting in the imitation of tics (TicTok) - which then become permanent. I\u2019d ask her if she wants to be stuck with this forever\u2026because she might be training her brain to do just that.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s your trip. You decide who comes. If she suddenly broke her leg in an accident, she\u2019s not coming then either because she\u2019d couldn\u2019t ride any rides.\n\nTell her she has a medical condition that now requires her to be home.", "NTA. Oh God. Knew a few people who did this back in middle and high school, and one who still does it in college. Tourettes isn't common at all, and to be honest it's pretty easy to tell when it's faked. SOME people can partially suppress tics for short periods of time, but it's not perfect and for the large part they're wildly uncontrollable. It's especially uncommon for it to come out of the blue at this age, manifest like that, and only happen when she's not otherwise engaged with something more interesting that she doesn't want the inconvenience of having her body interrupt. \n\nShe almost definitely doesn't have tics, you're correct. Seen this same thing through multiple different kids, though all had issues where their parents paid them little to no attention. It's annoying and insulting, but you should also check and see if there's any underlying cause for her to be acting like this. Most likely it's just her young teenage self being stupid and wanting more attention, but its possible it's a sign of something deeper. Either way, NTA that you don't want her imposing on a family trip.", "NTA. This whole word trend of kids faking disorders they saw on tiktok is infuriating.", "So, let me first start off by saying there are different types of tics, which in and of itself, is not specific to Tourette\u2019s (neurological disorder). Some tics, like with a motor tic disorder, can be \u2018psychological\u2019 in that they are not a result of neurological damage/impairment, but rather surface due to psychological factors, like stress, anxiety, etc. Psychological tics, differentiated by the person\u2019s ability to suppress the tics if they concentrate enough to do so, can be safely treated with medication. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like Ashley may have read about the symptoms of Tourette\u2019s and took it to the extreme. HOWEVER, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she has no tic disorder.\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\nI have motor tic disorder. It started when I was in 3rd grade, around age 7. The manifestations would change (e.g. vocal tics, muscular tics/twitches, joint popping, rolling eyes, etc.), but there was a time in my life when all symptoms hit at once, after my mom\u2019s life-threatening car accident. \n\nI mention this because at first, I used to think I had Tourette\u2019s, since no one ever heard about psychological tics, and many of my symptoms are the same. But the difference was that when I was distracted, focused on something, deep in non-stressful conversation, or tried hard enough to hide/suppress them, I wouldn\u2019t have them.\n\nSO, I feel Ashley probably doesn\u2019t have Tourette\u2019s, unless she very coincidentally has an extreme case of it. But don\u2019t discredit her just yet. \n\nI had to be seen by three specialists before my disorder was identified/diagnosed\u2014 a neurologist, a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I\u2019d recommend having her seen by the latter.\n\nWhy?\n\nIf she does in fact have psychological tics, like I do, and you\u2019re only seeing her when she\u2019s suppressing them (I did this a lot out of fear of embarrassment), depending on the actual severity of her alleged condition, they might actually be quite treatable by very low dose psychotropic medication, which only a psychiatrist can prescribe and would be better able to determine if medication would be effective/appropriate for Ashley\u2019s potential condition (since she\u2019s still an adolescent).\n\nIn my case, until there was a global medication shortage, I used to take 1 mg of the anti-psychotic medication Haloperidol (Haldol). Not for psychosis, but because it was found to negate motor tics, and it worked like a charm. \n\nI eventually had to switch medications almost a decade later, due to the shortage, but point being, if she actually does suffer from tics, a psychiatrist may be better equipped to treat her.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, though. Your concerns about the airport do seem valid. Just for future reference, though, you could always have her registered with TSA as a PreCheck flyer. It\u2019s a bit of a process, but it would make the security check-in process much quicker.\n\n#NTA", "Hey OP, I'm going to go with NTA here, and let me break down why.\n\nFirst of all, kudos for trying to make an informed decision by researching and observing Ashley's behavior. It's clear you care about her, and you're trying to do what's best for everyone involved.\n\nYou're not obligated to take someone on vacation if their behavior is disruptive or upsetting, especially when it seems that the behavior might not be genuine. It's important to remember that your sister and Ashley's doctor are also skeptical about the situation. While Ashley might be going through a rough patch, it's essential to set boundaries and consequences for her actions, because, let's face it, the world won't always be as understanding as you are!\n\nHaving a frank conversation with Ashley and her mom about your concerns is a good first step. They might not be thrilled with your stance, but it could be the wake-up call Ashley needs to address whatever is really going on.\n\nSo, stand your ground, OP. You're looking out for everyone's best interests, including Ashley's, and that makes you NTA. Good luck and happy theme park-ing!", "NTA she doesn't have Tourretes, she has TikTokitis. There's some bizarre trend going on of teens thinking it is a. hilarious and b. a free ticket for being a rude jerk.\n\nShe would better spend the time you are away with her siblings volunteering with real Tourretes patients.", "NTA. Whether you believe she can control it or not, she isn't well enough to go on a trip and it will be super annoying for you too. She needs to stay home and get treatment asap.", "Hey, *your* trip? You can take who you want to take. If decorum and good behavior don\u2019t look like they will be observed by the potential participants? Then somebody can get left at home to hopefully have a productive relationship with their therapist. \n\nNTA and I hope you have an excellent trip.", "NTA- obviously she's acting out, why, who knows?  it's not your job to find out or to fix it.  I'm sorta surprised her parents let it go on this long.  my father would have beat the hell out of me had i acted like this, but then i'm a guy, and from a time fathers wouldn't spare the rod.  hell i remember my grandmother spanking the stuffing out of my 12yo cousin (also a boy) because he cussed, she actually chased him down, tackled him and spanked his ass raw in front of the family.  He never cussed in her presence again.  turnout out to be an upstanding honor student with a wife and kid (frankly he turned out better then i did).\n\nObviously I'm not saying it's time to switch the foolishness out of your niece, but i think her parents are making this worse by not putting their foot down.  your sister is spoiling her girl, and turning her into a monster, and someone had to draw a line in the sand on this.  if her sister doesn't like it, she can either not go, and let the child continue to act out, or figure out an appropriate way to end this nonsense.  (if it were me the cell phone would have been the first thing to go)", "NTA. If everyone genuinely believes she is faking it.

Too much emotions (even good ones) make symptoms worse. Is she ok with this happening in public? If she is, it may end up in bad mood and again worsen the symptoms. I think you and her mom, as an adults who knows her best, should consider everything and choose what is the best for her. Not going might be better.", "NTA at all.", "NTA. Whatever is going on with Ashley needs to be figured out before taking her on any trips.  Especially a plane ride. If she were to have an outburst on the plane without  a diagnosis to justify said behavior it could end up with you being kicked off or banned from  flying. Also it wouldn't be fair to the others girls if Ashley were to continue having the tics/outburst throughout the trip. It couls negatively impact the quality of the experience for everyone. Also there is a safety  concern  if she is being rude to others during these outburst. \nNot everyone is understanding.  Having the outburst with the wrong person could lead to violence. So I wouldn't feel comfortable taking Ashley on a plane trip until there is a proper diagnosis with a treatment plan in place to help mitigate the outburst if they do continue to happen.", "NTA- my cousin went through something similar but he actually has tourettes.

If she\u2019s really suffering from this, she will know her symptoms like the back of her hand, and will be consistent with her description. \n\nEven at 7yo, I knew that I would have this urge to roll my eyes, or growl in the back of my throat, or swing my arms around (kind of like the urge to scratch when you get poison ivy/oak). \n\nObviously her condition may be different from mine, but point being, she should know things like what happens, when it tends to happen, what environmental factors influence the severity, how she feels when it happens, etc.\n\nIf her description doesn\u2019t seem consistent with each telling, or she doesn\u2019t seem very knowledgeable about what she\u2019s allegedly experiencing, then perhaps that\u2019s something her therapist should know.\n\nJust a thought. \ud83d\ude42", "My advise in this case would be to get a doctor to give them a definitive answer.
