{"id": 34397, "submission_id": "18z9mv4", "title": "AITA for telling my cousin to stop hijacking her sister's pain?", "selftext": "My cousin \"Tammy\" is 34 and has always had a desire to be the center of attention. Given this, I'm not sure why I was expecting anything different but given the circumstances I would have figured she would tone it down. Her sister (not blood relation to me because they have different dads) is 22 and she just gave birth to her son, whom was unfortunately born still. It was very unexpected. There were no pregnancy complications and everything was going perfectly but during her last scan, his heart simply stopped while they were in the middle of the ultrasound. She gave birth 3 days later, after being induced. As a mom myself, I cannot imagine the pain and suffering. Her going a full 3 days, knowing her baby was gone, before she was able to birth him is so heartbreaking. \n\nNow.. when she actually went in to labor she struggled immensely. Mentally she was not in it, which was making the process harder I'm sure. At some point the doctor asked my cousin to hold her sister's leg back to help the process. Since then, my cousin has been over the top trying to steal her sister's pain. Posting on Facebook that it was the worst day of her life and how she is so heartbroken. Posting pictures to her Instagram with her and the deceased baby with captions saying \"my loss of you will never be forgotten. I miss you already my beautiful boy\". It's to a point where people are asking her when SHE got pregnant, thinking the baby is hers, and those are the only people she doesn't respond to so she never clarifies to anyone that this is actually not her baby at all. She does however respond to everyone saying \"omg I'm so sorry for your loss\". I DO understand she has grief. That's not even a question. But she's riding her sister's pain and depriving her sister the resources she needs to heal. \n\nWell, I offered to make her sister dinner and bring it over to her and her sister asked if she could come to my place because being near her son's nursery was too hard. I of course said yes. She got a ride from my cousin. They invited over a few other family members of theirs (totally fine). Every single time anyone hugged this girl or told her how sorry they were, etc, my cousin would start the water works. \"How do you think I feel? I delivered my nephew dead. I'm not okay\". Eventually I was beyond fed up and pulled her aside and told her to stop hijacking her sisters pain and that this isn't about her. I told her to stop claiming she delivered that boy because she didn't. She held her sisters leg, which is common. I told her she was being selfish as fuck and if she didn't stop, she could leave because she's sickening me. I also told her that I understand she's in pain too but that does not compare to her sisters pain at all. She ended up leaving immediately after that, stating that I'm an \"ignorant piece of work\" to think she's not feeling this pain as deeply as her sister is and that she \"hopes I never know this pain\" (I do know this pain, I watched my mom go through it when I was 16 but it was my mom's pain, not mine).

As someone who has lost a child, being an aunt/uncle is not he same as being a mother/father who lost a child. How incredibly selfish to post pictures of the deceased child to SM and then not to correct people thinking that she's the parent. I would blast her all over SM.", "NTA. I went through almost the exact same thing. Went in for a routine ultrasound at 34 weeks, and his heart had stopped. \n\nI was in the hospital waiting for them to induce labor, and I got a ding on my phone. It was a fb video of my sister crying (without tears) about how she lost her nephew. Then she posted in my virtual baby shower that he died and told people not to bother sending gifts. She called everyone in the family and told them, and was handing me the phone to talk to people when I couldn't form words. I hadn't had a chance to process my own emotions, and there she was, soaking up whatever sympathy she could for herself while I was waiting to give birth to my deceased son.\n\nThere are no words for what it is like knowing that your child is gone and having to still go through labor and delivery and surviving everything that follows. It shattered me in every way, and I'm so, so sorry your sister went through that. No one deserves that kind of pain. She's lucky you're there to stand up for her. I certainly wish someone had for me. You're a good sister, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. \n\nIf she ever needs someone to talk to, I can refer her to the charity that helped me through, and either of you can message me any time. My thoughts are with you.", "NTA:  She has some serious mental issues, though nothing you say will get through to her.", "NTA.. your cousin needs therapy.", "NTA. It's really terrible that she's attention whoring in such a desperate and greedy way.", "NTA \nwhy the hell did your cousin take a picture of her dead infant neghew that is what makes me convinced that she is doing it for the attention \n\nHas she ever had a stillbirth or a misscarrige?\nDo you think it is possiblle she went through one and no one knew? \nBecause that is the only sane reason i can think that she is acting like this \n\nSend that women all your love she deserves it and nakes sure she knows its not her fult so many women feel like it is when they have a stillbirth and they shouldnt because its really is not", "Clear NTA but not my place to elaborate. I hope that you get responses from people who have been in similar situations that can give the right advice here.", "NTA, couldn't have been easy for her to be there with your sister when the baby was born but as you say this is not her pain and how dare she try and hijack it the way she is! It's in such bad taste!", "FFS.... What the hell is wrong with your cousin? Normally, I am very much a, \"don't interject unless you are specifically asked\" kind of person. But your cousin is putting on a despicable and pathetic performance. You stood up for a fragile, grieving mother against the worst sister I've ever heard of. I am feeling crazy second hand embarrassment for your cousin. She's a disgrace. You did right to shut that down. NTA", "NTA. You are exactly right about your cousin.", "NTA thanks for having the guts to say what no one else apparently was willing to. The mom should not have to be hearing that.", "NTA - you should also pull the sister aside and ask how she is doing with your cousin\u2019s behavior and let you know you are there for her. \n\nIt\u2019s super f\u2019d up and I\u2019m glad someone had the balls to tell cousin this is all not about her.", "NTA. Someone needed to put cousin in her place, and you stepped up to the plate. Hold your ground if family members try to tell you off for telling her off.", "100% NTA. My brother and his gf lost their almost 3 year old son last year. It broke my heart as his uncle. But never once did I think I was feeling the same level of grief as them and made damn sure their needs were met first. People who lose children lose a piece of themselves. There's no comparison at all.", "I dunno.\n\nYou should stay out of the sister dynamic (it's whiteknighting) and try to support both of them where they are.  Being in the room when it happened suuuuucks.", "NTA but it wasn't really your place.

I have a few in my family.", "NTA. You are absolutely correct. Your cousin\u2018s sister went through an entirely different level of loss. It\u2019s okay for your cousin to grieve, but it\u2019s wrong of her to compete for consolation/attention.", "NTA. I get that\u2019s she\u2019s in pain but you\u2019re right.

I think she would have told me as well because up until 2 weeks ago (when this happened) her and I were actually inseparable.

She has just always loved attention because she was deprived attention as a kid. This was her sister's first pregnancy.", "My sentiments exactly", "Put her in her place. It is disgusting and immoral.

My mom has made some really sarcastic and over the top passive aggressive comments to her whenever she mentions certain things and my cousin never picks up on it. My mom has lost all respect for her but won't openly say anything because she's afraid of going from zero to 100, given that she DID lose a baby the same way and if anyone had ever acted like that toward her during that time, there would have been hell to pay.

But god forbid anything happened to them, i would not be in nearly the same pain as my sister who carried them and i understand that. I may be in pain but she carried them for 9 months and has struggles as a mother that i do not have as their aunt.

Now obviously this isn't why the sister was doing it, but in a different situation this wouldn't be odd behavior.", "Sounds like you rightfully called out an attention vampire on her bullshit and she knows it. They do not like THAT sort of attention at all. She'll probably try to twist it around a bit to regain some control over the narrative but you got her a little scared now. \n\nChances are you aren't the only one who see this or at least suspects something bad coming from the attention vampire. These types of people are endless black holes of need and delusions. Not worth the time to fix but definitely worth calling out the toxic bullshit whenever possible.\n\nNTA\n\n She's getting high on her own sisters pain . Despicable and disgusting.", "Is the sister so out of it with grief she can't be bothered to deal with her?", "NTA. Tell Mom to go straight to 100. Heck, straight to 1000. Your cousin is disgusting, pretending she's the one that lost her baby. I'm surprised sis hasn't slapped her."]}
