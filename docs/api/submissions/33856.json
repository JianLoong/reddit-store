As long as you're washing your hands with soap and water, as everybody should do when handling food, then there's zero issue.", "NTA, stains are not dirt. If he's so hung up on it, you have already offered the perfect compromise. You cook for you, he cooks for himself until the stain wears off.", "YTA if you stay in a relationship with this racist entitled asshat", "NTA - His behavior is gross and racist.

There might be a deeper issue here", "NTA by far. Your boyfriend, hardcore TA. \n\nAnd if he is of a different culture than you, id question if he was low-key xenophobic.", "Is he a restaurant worker?\n\nDoes he work professionally in the industry?\n\nBy professional standards you shouldn\u2019t touch food without gloves while your hands are contaminated by anything.\n\nYTA (softly) because I get where he\u2019s coming from.  I work in a kitchen and those habits and procedures get ingrained.  While I know it\u2019s not bad and henna isn\u2019t going to rub off, it feels wrong because of my experience.", "This is so ridiculous of him to think. My husband is from the mid-west in the US and I was telling him how women in my culture would occasionally dye their hair with henna (particularly as they aged) and that henna \"tattoos\" were a great way to test run whether you wanted a particular tattoo on a part of your body. I have a small tattoo from many years ago but have been very interested in another and he wanted to get something for the first time as well so he let me draw a design with henna on his upper arm just to get a feel for it. He didn't think twice and showered daily (sometimes twice since it was summer and he was doing outdoorsy stuff) and it never crossed his mind that the lasting design indicated he was unclean. \n\nIn a world where anyone can Google anything and learn pretty immediately from Wikipedia what's what, this reaction of your ungrateful boyfriend gives off a racially ignorant/biased vibe. I can't imagine another reason. I grew up in the south of the US and girls would go to spring break to Florida in middle school and come back with henna tattoos on their arm or wrist or whatever. Even their parents didn't view it as being dirty. That's not how skin and dyes work. \n\nYou're NTA, BUT, you might be to yourself if you don't figure out what your man's problem is. Don't cook for him, give his potentially sheltered understanding of things are fair shot to be educated, and if he won't listen or doesn't have the mental acuity to understand, then do yourself a favor and find a good man who will wear henna with you and cook with you too (instead of.... whatever this guy is).", "Lolol\n\nScrew this guy. He can cook for himself. He\u2019s a big boy. \n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA. But I would look at it in the context of the whole relationship. If this is the only time he has asked you to do something unreasonable- it makes him happy and doesn\u2019t hurt you so you can agree to do it. If it\u2019s a frequent thing, that\u2019s different.", "NTA. Frankly, your boyfriend sounds ignorant and/or racist. As long as the Henna used was organic, there should be no food safety issues.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a racist. He's shown his true colours, get out now.", "Nta. And don\u2019t touch his willy either til it wears off.", "This, coming from a man who sounds like he doesn't wipe his own ass? NTA.", "Nta I would have done the same. Washed hands are good enough unless you have cut on ur hand or fingers.", "NTA\n\n>and just wearing gloves when touching/preparing food is a \u201cgood compromise\u201d\n\nI know an even better one: he can make his own food and educate himself about what henna is.", "This is racism being presented as a reasonable concern. BF doesn\u2019t mind OP being from a different culture as long as she doesn\u2019t do anything outside of his comfort zone and then it\u2019s all dirty and weird and dangerous.
