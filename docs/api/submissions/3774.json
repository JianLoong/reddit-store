Note: I live in a different city than the rest of my family. This will come up in a second. \n\nMy (23M) dad\u2019s birthday was in the middle of the way. The plan was to meet everyone at a restaurant at 6:30; I\u2019d have to drive an hour to get there, and they\u2019d have to drive 25 minutes. I was literally out the door heading out when my mom called me and told me that they had a change of plans and didn\u2019t want to drive through traffic to the place, she and my dad had worked late, and it was just too chaotic/a hassle, so they would be going to a restaurant in their town in 15-20 minutes. I told him it would take me an hour and twenty minutes to reach them, and they would most likely be done by the time I got there.\n\nThroughout this conversation my mom was telling me how it\u2019s totally understandable if I couldn\u2019t make it and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. They didn\u2019t offer to change the time or go to replan, so everyone but me hung out and celebrated my parent\u2019s birthday. I told her alright and said happy birthday to my dad, who told me \u201cwe perfectly understand if it\u2019s too far and out of the way for you to make it. You\u2019re still coming up Friday to the party right? So we\u2019ll just see you then.\u201d The party is a big social gathering where my siblings and I are expected to bake things and help host.\n\nWell, my SO had been sick all week with a stomach bug, and I had seen them all weekend. I called my mom and told them I won\u2019t be able to make it to the party they\u2019re hosting for their neighborhood to make sure I didn\u2019t spread anything to them (I was told by my siblings that everyone is incredibly busy up there, and the last thing anyone needs is a stomach bug) and that other plans came up. My parents did not take this well and said I\u2019m punishing them, and the conversation spiraled into them claiming my lifestyle and life choices are splitting my family apart (story for another time I guess). \n\nAITA for changing my mind about helping out with a family party?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify. Yes, I do not want to help out at my parents party after being dragged through the mud and being left out. I also don\u2019t want to spread anything if I caught something from my SO; there is a very large chance I caught something from them with how much time I spent with them recently. The bug makes things somewhat convenient for me IMO.\n\nUpdate: I have been officially kicked out of the Christmas get-together.", "created_utc": 1669991651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zant6o/aita_for_not_helping_out_at_a_party_my_parents/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your siblings and the party goers certainly appreciated your thoughtfulness.  It sounds like your parents are projecting their guilt for moving the original dinner at the last minute on you.", "NTA\n\nWhat your parents did by excluding you from the first dinner was very unfair. Your SO being unwell provided the perfect excuse not to go to the big party. Not that I think you needed one. I read your comment about the debit card stuff.

Just ignore it and move on.", "absolutely nta", "Look, you are confusing the issue with irrelevant info. Stomach bugs are often VERY contagious.
