Do it by being just like them:\n\n1. Go get your stuff from her house. Pick a day you are going to visit anyway, make sure you have a car/any help you need, and your husband, not you, needs to lead the charge here and when you show up, visit for a little while, then stand up and say \"okay, let's collect the baby stuff now.\" Go to the room and start taking all the things that were gifted to you for the baby at the shower. When she protests, stick with the following- oh we very much appreciate you storing the stuff here, but this was all gifted to us for our home, we thought you knew that. If she says you all should stay here, give a very simple and calm \"why would we do that, we have our own home, where we would be much more comfortable.\" Give brief, calm, matter of fact statements that are not a defense of your position. YOU have the rational position. \n2. You and your husband need boundaries with her, and again he needs to take the lead. Again, brief, calm statements- we will be receiving visitors at home after the baby is born and WE will text people when they come over. \n3. Hold fast to those boundaries- if she comes over unannounced, don't answer the door, and practice locking the door and not responding immediately to text and phone calls. You and your husband HAVE to be on the same page. If you can't take her knocking or feel it's obvious you are home (like you are literally at the window), answer the door blocking her way (again, your husband should do this) and say \"it is so good to see you, were you dropping something off or did you need something? I'm sorry I can't invite you in, the baby is sleeping/we are in the middle of something, but it is great to see you, let's SCHEDULE a visit soon.\" CLOSE THE DOOR. \n4. With all of these, the big thing is to not engage in a debate and not cave, ever. Act as though you are talking to a child who wants to touch hot coals and you are the only rational person with the only rational response. \"No you can't touch that (no, now is not a good time), the child will protest (MIL will protest) and you respond with fact \"it is hot (we are busy).\" Just as you wouldn't entertain the child asking why they can't touch the hot coals a thousand times or bargain with them, you do not engage with MIL. These are our items, of course we want them, it is only going to be us in the hospital, that is our choice, no you can't pop by whenever you want, this is our home. \n\nYou and your husband have to work on this!", "You need to stand up, state your boundaries, and hold firm. It might not be fun. But neither is anxiously tiptoeing around. State boundaries, make sure you are in control of your possessions and move on that way. Ignore her screaming. Set consequences for her screaming. \n\nWhy the heck would you let her setup a nursery at her house of items gifted to you??? Next time your husband is free, go to her house, pack the stuff into the vehicle and move it into where you are living. \n\nIf you don't have control of your environment because it's GrandMIL house and she doesn't hold boundaries either, then start up a plan to move out.

I know, we didn't move baby to his own room til 10 months.

SIL told her mother her due date was a week later than it actually was to make sure she wasn't in the country when she gave birth.

Denial is STRONG with you and your husband.  You are letting her railroad you because you are afraid of what she will DO if you SAY NO MORE THAN ONCE.  Saying it once isn\u2019t enough for this woman, and YES she will go atomic the first two dozen times you absolutely put your foot down.\n\nIf you want to get your nursery stuff back, BRING FRIENDS who are largely strangers to the MIL.

Ie having the public watching a meltdown is often enough to keep the meltdown from happening.\n\nBtw, your husband being a first responder is NO EXCUSE for how he is NOT handling his mom.  He needs some counseling to realize why he is just letting this go on and on and on and on.\n\nOP, here\u2019s where it\u2019s at.  You have three futures here, no fairy tale ending:\n\n1.  You keep everything as is.  MIL will basically mother your child through adulthood.  You\u2019ll be the glorified nanny/babysitter.  You will have no say in how your child is raised because MIL will decide everything.  You will stay with your husband in GMIL\u2019s house as you gradually turn into shells of yourselves.  \n\n2.  You may allow scenario 1 to happen for a while, but eventually you will have had enough.  You Mr husband won\u2019t stand up for you and you\u2019ll divorce him.  Custody will likely be 50/50, meaning 50% you, 50% MIL.  Again, see #1 for how MIL will manage to dictate how your child is raised (and let\u2019s face it, your relationship with kiddo will be suboptimal).\n\n3.  Your husband GROWS A PAIR, YOU also grow a pair of she-balls, you get some couples counselling for how to deal with MIL and also to support you while she goes atomic, and YOU PUT ALL FOUR FEET DOWN HARD.  \nA) You, husband and a pack of friends (the friends are mandatory to inhibit MIL\u2019s crazy) bring back your nursery stuff to YOUR house.  \nB) If MIL wants to live with and nurse GMIL, you let her do that full time and move out.  \nC) You set HARD BOUNDARIES.  Visiting with baby is restricted to times when BOTH parents are there and only for X amount of time 30 min-1 hour).  After that, she\u2019s out the door.  It\u2019s best if you have multiple relatives over who WILL obey the time frame and will help get MIL out the door.  If she doesn\u2019t, your husband will have to show her out (and it HAS TO BE HIM.  He needs to take an active role in policing his mom or your relationship is doomed).\n\nD) RINSE.  REPEAT.  It may take even a year or two for her to learn her place.  You should have occasional visit with a counsellor to help you work through this.  \n\nE) Outcome: you develop healthy relationship with MIL.  You are no longer waking up dreading what she will do each and every day.  You will be able to raise kiddo according to your own wishes.  You will no longer feel like you have no control over your life and your marriage will be better.  Has your OB not told you that stress is bad for the baby?\n\nE-supplement: BTW, did MIL have written permission to discuss your medical details with your OB?  If not, OB may well have violated HIPAA laws.  And if she put OB on blast, WHY did OB not just hang up the phone?  \n\nYour choice.  1, 2, or 3.

Yes, your MIL is an AH but you and your husband are enabling that behaviour to a TERRIFYING extent.  You\u2019re terrified of her.  Denial is STRONG with you and your husband.  You are letting her railroad you because you are afraid of what she will DO if you SAY NO MORE THAN ONCE.  Saying it once isn\u2019t enough for this woman, and YES she will go atomic the first two dozen times you absolutely put your foot down.\n\nIf you want to get your nursery stuff back, BRING FRIENDS who are largely strangers to the MIL.  That will inhibit her craziness (because who wants to be the \u201ccraziest woman in the neighbourhood who banned OP and her friends from collecting the nursery stuff that was kept hostage\u201d?  Ie having the public watching a meltdown is often enough to keep the meltdown from happening.\n\nBtw, your husband being a first responder is NO EXCUSE for how he is NOT handling his mom.  He needs some counseling to realize why he is just letting this go on and on and on and on.\n\nOP, here\u2019s where it\u2019s at.  You have three futures here, no fairy tale ending:\n\n1.  You keep everything as is.  MIL will basically mother your child through adulthood.  You\u2019ll be the glorified nanny/babysitter.  You will have no say in how your child is raised because MIL will decide everything.  You will stay with your husband in GMIL\u2019s house as you gradually turn into shells of yourselves.  \n\n2.  You may allow scenario 1 to happen for a while, but eventually you will have had enough.  You Mr husband won\u2019t stand up for you and you\u2019ll divorce him.  Custody will likely be 50/50, meaning 50% you, 50% MIL.  Again, see #1 for how MIL will manage to dictate how your child is raised (and let\u2019s face it, your relationship with kiddo will be suboptimal).\n\n3.  Your husband GROWS A PAIR, YOU also grow a pair of she-balls, you get some couples counselling for how to deal with MIL and also to support you while she goes atomic, and YOU PUT ALL FOUR FEET DOWN HARD.  \nA) You, husband and a pack of friends (the friends are mandatory to inhibit MIL\u2019s crazy) bring back your nursery stuff to YOUR house.  \nB) If MIL wants to live with and nurse GMIL, you let her do that full time and move out.  \nC) You set HARD BOUNDARIES.  Visiting with baby is restricted to times when BOTH parents are there and only for X amount of time 30 min-1 hour).  After that, she\u2019s out the door.  It\u2019s best if you have multiple relatives over who WILL obey the time frame and will help get MIL out the door.  If she doesn\u2019t, your husband will have to show her out (and it HAS TO BE HIM.  He needs to take an active role in policing his mom or your relationship is doomed).\n\nD) RINSE.  REPEAT.  It may take even a year or two for her to learn her place.  You should have occasional visit with a counsellor to help you work through this.  \n\nE) Outcome: you develop healthy relationship with MIL.  You are no longer waking up dreading what she will do each and every day.  You will be able to raise kiddo according to your own wishes.  You will no longer feel like you have no control over your life and your marriage will be better.  Has your OB not told you that stress is bad for the baby?\n\nE-supplement: BTW, did MIL have written permission to discuss your medical details with your OB?  If not, OB may well have violated HIPAA laws.  And if she put OB on blast, WHY did OB not just hang up the phone?", "You say no. If you know she \"goes over your head\" (which you should've already put a stop to), then put in preventive measures. Put passwords with your drs. Tell them they are not allowed to talk to her about anything concerning either of you. Tell the hospital where you're giving birth that you want NO visitors, and explain the situation to them. They'll keep her out. If she throws a fit, she will be handled by them. Go home. Lock your doors (change locks if she has a key). Tell her what you and husband's boundaries are, and use consequences if she chooses to ignore them. YOU and your husband have the ability to keep her from doing these things. You just are too afraid to do what it takes.", "OP, you need to realize boundaries are for yourself. You can\u2019t set a boundary for someone else.

If she refuses, then inform her that in your thank you letters to people who sent the gifts inform them who delighted you were by their thoughtfulness and you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll love using them but unfortunately MIL has decided that the gifts were for her use and not yours. If she sees how serious you are about actually saying that, she\u2019s likely to back down. Or just walk in and take the items that are actually yours.\n\nFourth, no one actually needs to see the baby, or hold the baby, or take pictures of or engage with the baby without your permission. You can stay in your bedroom as long as you want, all that newborn needs is you, a clean diaper, and a safe place to sleep. If they can\u2019t be respectful of you, they don\u2019t need to be in your child\u2019s life.\n\nFifth, STOP GIVING IN. Don\u2019t change your hair. Push back on every \u201cthat\u2019s not what a mother does/looks like\u201d comment.

The staff will be informed of this. You may see your grandchild when I am ready. I will not discuss this further.\u201d \u201cWe are staying at our own house. I will not discuss this further.\u201d \u201cYou have our answer. I will not discuss this further.\u201d (And walk away. Repeat.)\n\nSet your boundaries for YOURSELF. And stick to them. If she wants to call your OB and try to shop up at the hospital, let her. You can\u2019t control her so don\u2019t try. Stick up for yourself and eventually she will get the point. Or move far away.", "So, what if she does try to handle it herself? That's on her - not you. If she is going to try and attend the birth - let hospital security deal with her. Same with her calling your OB - you are not responsible for this. You are not responsible for managing her behaviour! Let her burn her own bridges and deal with the consequences. Just make it very clear that you are not on her side and she has gone against your wishes and you are upset by her actions. \n\nFair enough it's not your house, but why does she treat you like a slave? You can't stop her doing what she wants because this is grandMIL's decision. But you can stop doing things for her when she's there that make you feel like a slave.

If she texts you, block her. Then go get your own place as soon as you can afford it.", "That baby is getting kidnapped", "They don't take no for an answer because your no doesn't mean no.  It means keep pushing until you say yes.  Nothing will change until you both set, and enforce, no as a boundary.  It will mean larger adult temper tantrums for awhile, which will be annoying.", "Yes you can. You can take your child into the bedroom and lock the door. \nYoure not helpless in this situation. \n1. Put them on the no list at hospital\n2. Wear the baby when they\u2019re around so they can\u2019t grab baby from you. \n3.

I doubt it though.\n\nIt sounds more like you and your husband haven't seriously told her to stop calling your baby hers, and that you want to keep your shower gifts, and you don't want her at the hospital.\n\nLying to avoid telling her you don't want her there is childish and is going to backfire in a bad way.", "I guess if you don't want to do the grown up thing and confront the actual problem.

You guys made your bed honestly...", "First solution that comes to mind: grandMIL and MIL move in together (they sound like peas in a pod) and you and hubby escape and live away from them.  \n\nEasier said than done, I know, but looking after gMIL shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of...everything. Your privacy, your autonomy, your sanity. It\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t have other options - you and hubby are just the easiest to push around and bully. Get out and let them figure it out.", "Then stop paying her bills and use that money to move out. If they\u2019re not respecting you, why should you be paying for your own misery?", "You're letting GrandMIL walk all over you too. If she is not with you, she's against you. If she allows MIL there, then you won't be. Tell her that. And then stop paying the bills and move out. And stop saying you can't bc MIL has seizures and  can't look after GrandMIL blablabla. That is not your concern.  GrandMIL and MIL will have to find a solution to that problem, why are you solving it for them if it's detrimental to you and your family. They made their bed, let them lay in it. All the things you're doing for GrandMIL is an extremely generous favor.

You owe it to your children to set boundaries and enforce them.", "You are paying the bills. You can *stop* paying the bills and use that money to save up to get out.

You need to tell her that you will not live somewhere & care for someone who does not respect your boundaries. She cannot tell MIL when you go into Labor, she will not allow MIL to see the baby without your explicit permission. \n\n She cannot have her cake and eat it too - if she wants free live-in carers, she needs to respect them.

Otherwise answers would be limited to YTA OR NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not her home either.  Tell her if she shows up uninvited, you and hubby are moving out.  Honestly, a young couple with a baby should not be responsible for an elderly person anyway.  Tell MIL she can take care of granny if you can\u2019t set rules for the home you live in.  You may not like what I have to say.  You are angry with a redditor who has no control over your life.  But won\u2019t deal with someone who seeks to control you unfairly.

The judge and CPS are going to look at how you've abdicated your parenting rights and responsibilities to her and say the kid should stay with her because you're obviously not up to the task.  And then you'll be ordered to attend parenting classes and therapy and maybe in a year or so you *might* get your kid back.\n\nAnd that is exactly what she intends to do. She's already taken your belongings, she's made it clear she intends to be there for the birth and afterwards to take care of \"her baby\".
