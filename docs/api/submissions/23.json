We have always been a \"we have our own money\" kind of couple, but have always had a joint account that we both put money into to pay for groceries, rent, electricity etc.\n\nPrior to living with her I lived with my parents for a while and I was working full time so I managed to save up quite a lot of money, she is the complete opposite where if she gets money she spends it. I recently decided that I am going to put my savings into a house and move into there. All of the money going into the house will be mine and none of it will be hers.\n\nWhen we spoke about it I said to her that when we moved into the house, I would like her to pay rent. She claimed that if we were to move in as a couple that she would not pay rent because she wouldn't be renting a place, she would be living in my house with me. I said that she would need to still pay half of the mortgage payments, but it would be no different to her paying rent to any other place we were living in, only at the end of the day, the house would completely be under my name.\n\nBasically I want her to pay rent to live in my place, she doesn't think she should have too. AITA?\n\nEdit: to answer a few common questions. I used the word mortgage in the post and that was a mistake, I never actually said the word mortgage, just the amount I asked for was equal to half of the mortgage which is about less then 25% of most rentals in the areas. I am also able to make payments without her assistance and will pay for all upkeep like any homeowner would", "created_utc": 1667217509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi9rp9/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_pay_rent_on_a/", "score": 3161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Legal protection?\n\nWhen you pay rent to a landlord, you are given certain legal protection via a legally-enforceable contract that states each party\u2019s rights and responsibilities, ie the landlord is responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the building. It also prohibits landlords from being able to evict tenants without notice. This is why tenants pay higher rents to have this protection.\n\nIf/when she moves in with you, what will she have to protect herself?

Will you give her notice? How much? What if it\u2019s not amicable?\n\nIf you\u2019re going to expect rent from her, then you need to draw up a legal contract and give her her rights.

But half the mortgage payment may be too much, depending on the going rates for rent in your area.\n\nLook at it like this: you have a financial advantage here, because her payments are helping you build equity. That's fair: you're the one buying the house, you have all the risks connected to that. But she also deserves a financial advantage of some kind - after all, you're not just roommates, you're a couple.\n\nHer financial advantage could take different forms. Your house could be closer to her work than her previous home, she could pay less to you than she paid in rent before, she could have more space for the same rent, or any combination of the above. \n\nJust making a blanket demand for half the mortgage may be unfair, depending on how high it is. Presenting this as an opportunity for her to save money, though, while living in your common home, may go a long way towards making this more palatable to her.\n\nAlso, any costs for maintenance or repairs are obviously your problem, not hers.", "NAH I completely understand why you wouldn't want to put your gf\u2019s name on a house that she's not paying for. \n\nHowever, if you expect her to pay rent then this can't be a one way street. Tenants have rights. There needs to be an agreement so she is protected since she is paying rent. If you break up you can't just throw her out, if there are repairs that's 100 percent on you as the landlord and so on. \n\nI'd also consider long-term plans. I'm assuming you'rethinking long-term. So do you expect her to pay rent her whole life or are there any plans what happens in x years? What happens if she wants to buy a house in a few years? Are you going to live in two places again? \n\nThis whole arrangement makes sense for the immediate future but if there are no plans for any long-term changes, I'd quite frankly wonder if you considered this a serious relationship.", "Info: you made a weird comment about how your GF didn\u2019t have the privilege of living rent free at home to build up savings.

If you insist that she contributes to the mortgage, you can hire a lawyer to draft an agreement so she gets equity too (less than you because you pay the whole downpayment) but still something.

She will not be your partner and equal on this \"home.\"\n\nWhen you looked for a rental, you did it together, right? Her needs were taken into account just like yours were? You both compromised when it came to the home and your needs? (location, space, set up, etc).

For whatever reason, you don't mention much about future and marriage, etc, but it sounds like that's also not on the table at the moment.\n\nSo, in order for her to keep living with you as a shared relationship, she has only one option- to follow you. That means she's giving up her ability to be equal in her own home. It also sounds like buying this home is more about your future than both of your future as a couple if the house and all the decisions are 100% you. Relationships are about more than just money and possessions.\n\nFor you, it becomes your house. It becomes investing in your future through equity. You gain more power over your living situation because you own the property, so they are your decisions to make. You gain financial assistance on the home you bought and remain 100% comfortable in your home doing so because it's your GF who's assisting you and living with you. Otherwise, for you to get financial assistance like what she'd be giving, you'd have to let a stranger live with you.\n\nWhat about for her?

We recently moved into a much bigger house with a bigger mortgage, still entirely in his name. Of course I had a say in it as we\u2019re a couple but I said that at the end of the day it was mainly his decision as at it\u2019s his money.

So surely it's only fair if her name goes down for what she pays, or she only pays a fraction of the mortgage, and continues putting the same into you shared account, and putting some away for her to be able to save her own house.\n\nAlso did your parents make you pay rent at home?

I'd be living there, so of course I'd be expected to contribute financially.\n\nSure, if you guys break up she'll leave with nothing, no equity nor would she be bought out of her half if she was on the mortgage too, but if you both rented a place instead, she'd also be leaving without those things so I fail to see a difference. If she doesn't want to pay you rent and it's a hill she's willing to die on, that's a huge problem imo.

The couple were splitting rent before, so I dont get why OP should have to take on more of the household expenses while his SO pays nothing, just because he now owns the home?

One of my good friends basically ended up in this situation because she was a Master's student while her long term bf was already working and saving. Adding her name to the mortgage would have tanked the rate and pre-approval amount due to her low credit score for being an unemployed student for many years without income.

She shouldn\u2019t need to pay half **his** mortgage because **he** decided **he** wanted to buy a house. If I was the girlfriend, I would say no way. Maybe she is completely content on renting and living her current lifestyle. I am assuming that since he is going to buy the house and everything will be in his name, she isn\u2019t going to have any say in where the house is located, which house is purchased, what she wants in a residence, how it will be decorated, etc. etc. If we are drawing up an agreement, it\u2019s that we\u2019re going to split the equity across some line. Maybe he paid for all the closing costs on the home but if we are going to be paying for the home equally, I would want to get part of that equity. What happens if they break up in two years? She gets absolutely nothing for paying half his mortgage for the last two years? That isn\u2019t fair. I feel like she should get some equity. Maybe the contract should say if they break up and part ways, he has to buyout part of what she paid into the home.\n\nBut in some ways I feel like that\u2019s not quite the right approach either. No matter how you do it, it\u2019s going to ruin their relationship by making her strictly a tenant. It puts distance between them and their relationship and sort of removes the aspect of him actually *wanting* her there. I think the only way to do this is for him to buy the house on his own, like he said he was going to do anyways, and then decide if he wants her to live there with him or not. I mean, can he afford the house on his own if she breaks up with him next year and moves out? If they advance in their relationship later on and get engaged or married, or whatever, they can move forward with splitting the cost of the mortgage in a now shared home.\n\nBut drawing up a contract and treating her as a tenant is going to destroy their relationship.", "I\u2019m always confounded by people who think they shouldn\u2019t pay anything toward housing.

But I will say my partner and I aren't married and we split the mortgage on my house pretty near 50/50. I bought the house 5 years before he moved in and locked in pretty good rates. It was a big risk for me and I was house poor for awhile but the result is that while our city has exploded around us, we have a 3 bedroom house that costs $1100 a month. Before he moved in his rent on a 1-bedroom apartment was $1500 and I had a roommate paying $450 for a single room in my house.\n\nBefore we moved in we opened up our books to each other and considered the income, debts, and outlays we both have and made a plan to maximize our mutual financial success. He makes 10-15k more a year than me, depending on bonus but we both make enough to be comfortable which helps when making these decisions. We both pay $550 a month on my mortgage and while he doesn't get equity in the house (I offered a discussion down the line if we stay here to refinance and let him \"buy in\". Or to pay him rent and rent out my house if he wanted to buy a place) but the $1k a month he saves living with me let's him pay off his student loans and make any kind of investment he wants and he can move or leave when he wants to. I take on risk that he doesn't but I have the safety net of a house - it feels fair to both of us.\n\nThe trick is we sat down and talked about this. We balanced our books as a team with the goal of both of us thriving. I think that's the step that folks miss in these aita and relationship advice posts", "That amount on utilities seems very disproportionate to your mortgage.

I count internet as a utility.", "Its a appartement so nothing to fancy but it's about 600.", "I'm sorry, I don't believe I ever said OP was the asshole, or that she shouldn't have to pay some rent.\n\nI was just pointing out that OP can't only look at what rent would be at a comparable house, because they weren't living in a house before.  If he's asking her to pay MORE than she was paying in rent before, that's going to be an invitation for her not to move in, which is, apparently, what he wants.\n\nThere's a lot of factors to consider when you are cohabitating.  I think MOST of the time, people with very disparate incomes should be paying in proportion to what they make.  But when two people are looking to move in together for the first time (or looking for a new apartment/house together), you also have to look at whether it's a better deal for both people than they had before.  If it's not, if either party is going to be expected to pay more than before, it needs to be  because that person wants those extra benefits they would be getting.  Like if the partner with less income really wants an apartment building with a gym, and that's going to cost extra, they can't demand the partner that makes more money, pay more than they otherwise want to, to accommodate getting a gym building.  (In that case I would suggest they look at a comparable non-gym building, figure out what proportional rent would be for that space, and then the partner who wants the gym can decide if they're willing to pay the difference or not, so that everyone can get what they want.  That would result in the payment split not being proportional to income anymore, but it would be fair, because they were both able to decide what they valued and were willing to pay for).\n\nI think a lot of times people start looking at apartments before talking about what the maximum amount of money either person is willing to pay is.  So one person falls in love with a place (or in this case, decides to buy a house) without first making sure that is within the budget of the other person.  In this case OP says they can pay for the house all by themselves, so they can buy the house either way, the question is just if their girlfriend will still live with them or not.\n\nSo - as long as the rent OP is asking is proportionately appropriate to their incomes, and is within the girlfriend's desired budget (same or less than she was paying before, unless she explicitly agrees to pay more because she wants to)...  than OP is NTA.  But there's just so much we don't know in this situation that I consider to be an important factor.  And everyone else is focused on whether the requested rent is fair market value or not, not asking whether the girlfriend would normally be looking in this market bracket to start with.  The fact that OP can afford the house either way, really reinforces that he shouldn't be expecting his girlfriend to pay more than she was previously paying for their apartment, or he's going to slide into AH territory...  where his girlfriend obviously already live, considering she thought she'd be living their for free...  so it would be ESH.", "Where did I say he has to take nothing?  Can people here read?\n\nThis problem is entirely due to him buying a house without consulting with his GF, who he supposedly loves enough to live with for the last couple years.  They're supposed to be a partnership, especially since they've moved in together.  You don't just buy a house and say \"well hon, time to move in with me and I'm charging you X rent\" regardless of how fair X is.  Her agency in the relationship has been removed.  \"Move in and pay me the rent I ask or move out and end the relationship.\"\n\nI find it fascinating that \"he shouldn't make a profit off his girlfriend living with him\" is a controversial statement.", "She is paying less then market rate and she will pay less rent then the current situation...", "One thing that's getting overlooked is, as with most landlords, he's not *breaking even* as the mortgage is paid. Once it's paid off, he's gained ownership of the asset. The tenant has not.\n\nIt's easy to forget this when OP talks about her would-be rent being way less than comparable. But really this is a way of saying, oh but the other guys are way worse so what I'm doing can't be wrong. Yeah, I charge an arm for a loaf of bread, but the only other source of bread charges an arm and a leg!\n\nYou might be thinking, but he's not profiting, he's breaking even. Again, that isn't true. Let's put ourselves in the fantasy land that the mortgage is paid after 10 years and she's still with this guy. She's paid half of it. But he has sole ownership. Why? Because he had and laid out the initial capital.\n\nNot to make this argument too dependent on politics, but housing is obviously a basic human need. I think we can all agree on that. What OP is doing, without knowing or without caring, is introducing the commodification of that basic need into their relationship. A Marxist would call it exploitation - not based on how good or bad a \"deal\" each party is getting, but on the structure. The exploitation being worse elsewhere does not change the structure. She has a basic need, he is proposing that he has ownership of it.\n\nNow, obviously this has a lot of parallels to relationships. Shitty, patriarchal, controlling relationships. I'll give OP the benefit of the doubt on that, though his account of his partner of three years doesn't overwhelm the reader with love, nor is there any mention of partnership. So I'll stick to the basics. Introducing capitalistic principles into a relationship is a terrible idea, there are numerous problems and pitfalls as others have mentioned even going in with the best of intentions. Imbalance or dependency, it's all going to breed resentment from both parties. Possibly the only way to make this work is if you're ready and willing to commit to this person. Then, akin to most married couples, it becomes a partnership and assets are shared. If you're not, then this was a terrible idea to begin with. And because it was OP proposing to begin with that she move in, that she become dependent on him and pay him rent equal to his own payments - the nature of the relationship thus transformed without much of a say for her (what is she supposed to do? Shut up and put up?) - it's a solid YTA.", "For sure. The suggestions that she cover utilities, groceries, etc to make it fair is a good one (without knowing the numbers). Obviously he shouldn\u2019t be subsiding her cost of living fully, but he\u2019s talking landlord not future spouse. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t get making a major life decision like buying an entire property 3 years into a relationship without having that entire talk first about expectations for the future when it comes to money/home ownership etc. Assuming they\u2019re moving towards marriage, this shakes up the relationship dynamics a lot to only have one person as an owner. OP said he\u2019s already decided to do this, in which case his relationship may not survive it.", "Where does it say that he bought this house without consulting her though? I just reread the post and all his comments and he never says she was in anyway unaware of the purchase. Just that she now doesn't want to pay rent, which is not really fair at all.

She can get added to the mortgage if things progress, but this is just life.", "He's not trying to make a profit. He just want her to contribute to the household. Her beef isn't that he's buying the house or what he wants to charge. She feels like she shouldn't have to pay anything because he will own the house. He's not obligated to take care of her because he's ready to move forward with his life and she isn't yet.", "Is he supposed to put his life on hold until she decides she\u2019s ready to buy a house with him 50/50 - which with her apparent spending habits might be \u2026 never?", "while i agree with you that it's his gf not a tenant i disagree that he should have to check with her for anything. They are not married she is not his mom and if she isn't willing to pay then she can go along for the ride or piss off.", "I bought a house without consulting my gf. She didnt even see the property until I was under contract and nearly at closing. She doesn't work and has no income currently. I don't charge her rent, but I expect contribution in the form of chores around the house. Ultimately it would be nice to get her back to work in some capacity and contribute more meaningfully, but not at unnecessary expense.\n\nI don't disagree with charging rent, but it has to be clearly defined terms so that in the event of things ending between them, it's not financial turmoil for either of them. Also, part of buying the house is proving he can afford it. If the bank didnt think he could afford it, he wouldn't have gotten approval in the first place. Any other party contributing towards the mortgage (regardless of whether it's considered as rent) is financial gain for this guy, so its kind of a moot point. They can also still date and live separately, she doesn't have to move in or stay there for any significant amount of time to consider it a living space.", "You are coming from the premise that they will stay together indefinitely. The OP seems to be coming from the premise that shit happens and they can break up so they are protecting their interest. If the roles were reversed and this was a F buying a house with a M BF who is not contributing, everyone will be foe charging rent. \n\nRemember the gf is not contributing anything. They keep their finances separate. I infer from this they can buy what they want with their own money.", "They are not supposed to be a partnership. They are not married until they become husband and wife there is no partnership.", "This topic comes up in this subreddit a lot, and while I feel the majority of the votes equates to, \"Person X would have to pay rent anyway.
