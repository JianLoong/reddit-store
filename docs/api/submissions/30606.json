Rachel is my only sibling and her son, Bennett (15M) is my only nephew. Because we live on opposite sides the country, I only get to see them in person once every couple of years. \n\nSince I (36M) had recently moved to a beach town, Rachel and Frank suggested that Bennett could come for a visit. I was excited by the idea and told Rachel to send me an email with everything I needed to know. The email contained the name and contact number of the couple's retreat and flight information, as well as recipes for several vegan dishes.\n\nRachel and Frank are very into veganism and new age spirituality. Not my cup of tea, but no judgment. Though I usually eat a high protein diet, I resigned myself to cooking vegan meals for the week that Bennett stayed with me. His flight landed late in the evening, after which we watched a movie and ate some popcorn before going to bed. \n\nThe next day, I took Bennett to the grocery store to get some snacks and give me more ideas for things to make. He asked what I would normally cook for guests. I told him I enjoyed grilling and would usually make burgers, pork chops, steak, and seafood. Bennett said all of that sounded \"great\" and told me \"not to go to any trouble on \\[his\\] account.\"\n\nI was surprised and told him I thought he was vegan. He said his parents were vegan and that he eats whatever they put in front of him. However, Bennett claimed he didn't \"care about any of that stuff\" and would be happy to \"eat what \\[I\\] eat.\" Rachel's email never said Bennett had to eat vegan food, so I loaded up the shopping cart with various meats to grill. Bennett also threw in a couple tubs of ice cream. \n\nI had a great time with Bennett and was sad to see him go. Rachel told me later that the visit was the highlight of his summer. Everything seemed well until a few days ago, when I posted some pictures from Bennett's visit on my Facebook page - one of which showed Bennett tearing into a pile of steamed shrimp. Rachel called a few hours later and angrily accused me of trying to \"undermine \\[their\\] values.\" I told her she never said that Bennett had to keep a vegan diet and said she needed to discuss this with him. \n\nShe said I should have known better and asked if I would serve pork to a kid from a Jewish or Muslim family. I told her that veganism isn't a religion and she should have made her expectations clear. AITA?

I'm vegetarian (and now-ex who ate meat didn't eat pork) and we specifically asked friends/family to not serve meat--esp pork, to the kids.

If a 15 year old Muslim wants pork, you let them have it.  They are old enough to pick their own food", "my name is probably going to cause issues here, but: NTA and you sound like a good uncle!", "The only thing I would have done is asked him if he ever eats meat at home.

Then if he had said no you could look up how much to introduce at a time. Other than that your logic is actually very sound. She didn\u2019t specify he couldn\u2019t have it.

They pushed this lifestyle on everyone, and of course their kid couldn't eat meat or animal products. \n\nSuch a huge deal they made over being vegan and their kids *had* to strictly adhere! They were awful people. \n\nKnow what the now 28yo daughter does now? She is a butcher.

Them for forcing him to eat vegan when he obviously doesn't want to, and you for posting a picture that lets them know, and then telling them it was his fault instead of just rolling your eyes on the other end of the phone, apologizing and taking it on yourself. He's going to have blowback from that. \n\nFrankly, if a Muslim or Jewish teenager told me they wanted to eat pork, I'd get them a hotdog or whatever.

Maybe I'd call and double check with the parents right then and there and defer to whatever they gave permission for, especially if it's a health thing. \nBut honestly as an atheist if a kosher kid told me they'd always wanted to secretly try bacon and I knew it was fine health wise I would really really really really find it hard to say no", "NTA, it's abit of meat, he'll live, tell your sis to relax lol", "Minor correction, veganism is, in fact, a religion, as evidenced by your sister's reaction.", "NTA How awful that at 15 they still want to control what he eats.

Rachel is my only sibling and her son, Bennett (15M) is my only nephew. Because we live on opposite sides the country, I only get to see them in person once every couple of years. \n\nSince I (36M) had recently moved to a beach town, Rachel and Frank suggested that Bennett could come for a visit. I was excited by the idea and told Rachel to send me an email with everything I needed to know. The email contained the name and contact number of the couple's retreat and flight information, as well as recipes for several vegan dishes.\n\nRachel and Frank are very into veganism and new age spirituality. Not my cup of tea, but no judgment. Though I usually eat a high protein diet, I resigned myself to cooking vegan meals for the week that Bennett stayed with me. His flight landed late in the evening, after which we watched a movie and ate some popcorn before going to bed. \n\nThe next day, I took Bennett to the grocery store to get some snacks and give me more ideas for things to make. He asked what I would normally cook for guests. I told him I enjoyed grilling and would usually make burgers, pork chops, steak, and seafood. Bennett said all of that sounded \"great\" and told me \"not to go to any trouble on \\[his\\] account.\"\n\nI was surprised and told him I thought he was vegan. He said his parents were vegan and that he eats whatever they put in front of him. However, Bennett claimed he didn't \"care about any of that stuff\" and would be happy to \"eat what \\[I\\] eat.\" Rachel's email never said Bennett had to eat vegan food, so I loaded up the shopping cart with various meats to grill. Bennett also threw in a couple tubs of ice cream. \n\nI had a great time with Bennett and was sad to see him go. Rachel told me later that the visit was the highlight of his summer. Everything seemed well until a few days ago, when I posted some pictures from Bennett's visit on my Facebook page - one of which showed Bennett tearing into a pile of steamed shrimp. Rachel called a few hours later and angrily accused me of trying to \"undermine \\[their\\] values.\" I told her she never said that Bennett had to keep a vegan diet and said she needed to discuss this with him. \n\nShe said I should have known better and asked if I would serve pork to a kid from a Jewish or Muslim family. I told her that veganism isn't a religion and she should have made her expectations clear. AITA?   \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Considering he\u2019s almost adult- I mean by that time usually I would assume most parents get less controlling with what kids eat and so it seems pretty normal with why you were ok with this.\n\nI will say I am also spiritual and I think I kinda get here her mind was at- not necessarily bc I believe in all she does but I know lots who do and I agree to some extent, also got A LOT of research done over the years that\u2019s given me insight into new age and historical examples of spirituality. \n\nWhat I\u2019m guessing she meant was her spirituality probably guides her into being vegan so in allowing her son to go against this, you were in her eyes betraying her beliefs and being a bad influence on an impressionable teen. Big no no in spiritual world- it\u2019s taught heavily how influencing the outer world is to children, that we need to protect them from that influence and how illusion can sway kids down the wrong path if not careful- some take that to an extreme measure. Something else that comes up a lot spiritually is animals, their importance, treatment and such as well as the effect of eating the \u201cdead\u201d (aka meat). There are beliefs that you take on the energy of the animals death when you consume, so it can harm and disrupt the energy going on within the body (some believe this- and as most animals die mistreated, before their \u201ctime\u201d, and often afraid/in fear as they die, this can seem bad when you believe it true) in other cases it comes down to how sensitive and connected some humans get to be with animals, and there\u2019s a lot in spiritual research that explains that, driving a lot to veganism or at the least, being a vegetarian. I am not as hardcore, I eat only what I need with dairy (I don\u2019t believe it harms animals to consumer what is in excess, ex: cows have to be milked, so im on the side of spiritual where I won\u2019t waste what is provided by the universe through the animal), I don\u2019t hunt or kill animals (I believe in karma with these aspects and don\u2019t enjoy playing \u201cgod\u201d, so to speak, with animal\u2019s lives), but I do eat some meat, white meat only. Chicken and occasional fish- I have to bc I can\u2019t afford the prices of constant fruits and veggies that provide all nutrients (in this economy it\u2019s prices as heck) and personally im just not ready, it takes time for some to just move from eating all things the whole life only to adjust all eating habits as we grow and explore beliefs. Personally I think beef is also just bad for your health too, it\u2019s known to carry disease And it\u2019s not easily digestible at all. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s where the reference to religion comes from- spirituality legally bc it\u2019s in a way practically it\u2019s own \u201creligion\u201d if you\u2019d like to call it that.\n\n\nHere for no judgement! Even as a spiritual individual! Not all are like this too, my husband is very spiritual and is absolutely not vegan or vegetarian (altho he skips beef mostly too, after I quit he ate it less and saw the impact of beef when eating, it made him feel sick so it\u2019s rare now) and all our friends definitely eat meat meat meat. Only here to offer some insight as I have a pretty good perspective to offer I think :) I\u2019m not every much the get angry type, I don\u2019t believe in pushing for mistakes. I understand her being frustrated but I do think this was really just a simple misunderstanding blown out of proportion. Even in spirituality- they teach you forgiveness,, compassion, finding peace as much as possible and understanding in all situations , thinking before reacting, so it\u2019s actually a little interesting her reaction lol and even more, tho it\u2019s taught to protect kids, it\u2019s also taught to allow freedom and natural consequences to teach them within that. Kids gotta find the path and explore what\u2019s set out for them- from your comments it sound like that\u2019s their parenting style, allowing him freedom to develop how he wants, so this is off a little. but at the same time we all get emotional and blow up sometimes. \n\nI\u2019d give her time to cool and talk it out.", "Nta be there if he needs it aka set up a bank account his parents cant touch", "NTA.

There's a reason meat tends to be more expensive per calorie than e.g. beans - it uses more resources, and more land.
