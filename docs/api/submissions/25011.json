We got married last year. \n\nBackground: He and his ex (36F) were together about 10 years in their 20s and 30s. She is extremely close to his oldest friends so she\u2019s a part of our lives, though she lives in another state. They still have a friendship. I\u2019m very comfortable with this now, but at first, certainly put off by the notion of a partner still being close to an ex. When I first met her, she \u201cbig dicked\u201d me a bit. Which, honestly, being the empathetic person I am, I really gave her a lot of breadth and understanding. Nothing she did was ever straight up aggressive, but enough nuanced \u201cfuck you\u201ds. I attributed it to her feeling some type of way about her companion of 10 years moving on. While he had dated after they broke up, I was the first girl he was very serious about. Over time, she and I have come to a better place after hashing out a few things, but I have never really liked her after how disrespectful she was when I first came around. They are still close and speak on the phone, text, and see each other (in groups) when she\u2019s in town. I trust my husband completely. I truly believe this is plutonic and their friendship is the culmination of 10 years together and the affection you would carry after a relationship like that. I have a lot of respect for that chapter in both their lives. I\u2019ll be honest, I feel this way because I trust my husband completely. If I even had a inkling they were stepping over lines, my jealous ass would wig out. \nTDLR: I am fine with the friendship my husband has with his ex and trust him completely.\n\nNow to the argument we had. He had a birthday recently and she, like many others, made a story post wishing him a happy birthday. It featured an old photo of them asleep/cuddling and a phrase they used to say to each other about always caring for each other, even after this life. Like some \u201ccradle to the grave, down with each other forever\u201d vibe.\n\nIt upset me. I\u2019ve seen this picture 100x at this point. It feels very intimate to me. What is upsetting to me is that it feels inappropriate for another woman to post intimate sentiments about my husband. It feels disrespectful, possibly more-so because of my history with her.\n\nHowever, I do not have this same reaction to one of his oldest female friends, his best friend\u2019s wife, posting a photo of them cuddling/hanging out with a very similar message.\n\nAITA for being uncomfortable or is this weird?", "created_utc": 1692445537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ve3jr/aita_for_being_upset_over_a_photo_of_my_husband/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt her intentions are innocent", "NTA your intuition is spot on. She\u2019s trying to flex. You seem to be healthy with a good perspective. Sounds like you trust your husband so maybe let this be water off a ducks back. Instead of playing right into her mishugas. But you are not wrong.", "NTA. I honestly don't even think the ex likes your husband romantically anymore and this is more about upsetting you and reminding everyone else that she was there first. If she was actually interested in your husband, she'd message him directly.\n\nAll I can say is that you and your husband are together now and her immature behaviour isn't going to do anything to your relationship. I feel like you should ignore her - it's like she's trying to get a reaction out of you. Or you can just respond like the picture didn't exist in the story.", "You\u2019re NTA but I can\u2019t see anything that makes your husband the AH from what you\u2019ve written either. I think it\u2019s really hard for the people of reddit to give a fair judgement of your husband and the friend without knowing the dynamic though. I will say that I\u2019d be extremely uncomfortable with the picture and intimate words. Having said that, I would probably be uncomfortable with most of the situations you mentioned based on her trying to \u201cone-up\u201d you from the beginning. That\u2019s usually done out of jealousy, so my thoughts would go straight to her still having feelings.", "NTA.  There are enough red flags here to signal a space station from terra firma.  The problem isn't the ex.  It's the fact that she's still in his life, blatantly and openly disrespects his wife...and he's totally OK with that.  This shows that HE has no respect for HIS WIFE and gives more  meaning to his relationship with his EX GF than he does to his marriage.\n\nThe right thing to do would have been to run (not walk) away from this situation as soon as you realized his ex was still in his life and giving you attitude, which he allowed.  You married into this awkward situation.  For that, I'm tempted to say ESH.   But I'm trying to be generous.  You caused a bit of this problem yourself.  You knew what you were getting into.", "Nta that\u2019s weird", "NTA. \n\n>I do not have this same reaction to one of his oldest female friends, his best friend\u2019s wife, posting a photo of them cuddling/hanging out with a very similar message.\n\nYou don't have that same reaction to others because the others probably didn't \"big dick\" you like she did.", "NTA. Your feelings are completely valid, she is \"big dick energy\"-ing you. It's highly inappropriate for a person to post a pic cuddling with an ex (with a very intimate quote), especially when the said ex is already married. Talk to your husband about this. If you're right to trust him, he should understand that this is completely unacceptable. \n\nJust to be clear, staying friends with an ex is fine. Acting delusional like you're still together with an ex is not.", "ESH. To be honest, it sounds a lot like you\u2019re interpreting stuff in a way that sounds very biased. You say you\u2019re \u201cempathetic\u201d but you straight up admit to being jealous - \u201cmy jealous ass would freak out\u201d? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as empathetic or as graceful to her as you seem to think you are or want us to think you are. It sounds a lot like you have personal baggage about this that you\u2019re projecting onto her, and are perceiving things as slights because of it.\n\nHowever, I also don\u2019t think the ex is safe here either. Posting pictures of yourself cuddling your partner of 10 years post-breakup is weird, but like\u2026 for a birthday post? Even weirder. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily done out of malice, but it definitely sounds inappropriate.\n\nHave a conversation with your husband about boundaries, but also consider getting some help for your jealousy issues. It sounds a lot like you\u2019re specifically projecting these feelings onto her, since you outright stated that it is specifically with the ex. Being jealous of that is normal, but this reaction is not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In my opinion there should be boundaries with exes when they are still involved in each other's lives and this to me is beyond what I see as acceptable.

It's beyond disrespectful to you and he should wonder how he would feel if it was an ex of your posting stuff like that.", "Nta.

I can\u2019t imagine having a partner feel uncomfortable over and over because of an EX and just keep on going. It\u2019s so confusing. I get there still being love, but do they have kids? They can have the same friends, but she acts like he\u2019s her territory or some weird shit. \n\nHe needs to address this. Honestly, this just turned into a him problem. No woman would be THAT comfortable with an ex acting like this, let alone them still being close. She\u2019s waving the red flags and he\u2019s ignoring them while you collect them. It\u2019s fucking wild.", "But I'm not sure what the husband is supposed to do about it?", "Imagine two dudes arguing over whose dick is bigger, but with the things that are important to women.", "I mean...talk to her? About boundaries? There was no info on the post about the husband being aware that OP was uncomfortable. The first step is making sure your spouse is aware so there's no miscommunication", "Ahhh. Should have been more descriptive haha", "Thanks!"]}
