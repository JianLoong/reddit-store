Not sure if you ever worked in service before but so many people pronounced things differently from me and I did not give a fuck or feel like they were \"correcting\" me.\n\nAlso, let's say we actually follow your line of thought. If they serve you a different dish, you must never mention it to them because your influence over them will mean that you are intimidating them by \"correcting\" your order and asking for the right dish. You would be contradicting them because that means they brought you the wrong dish. Your memory of your order was more correct than theirs. So you should absolutely never try to get the right dish, and you should override your habit of eating a dish you were comfortable ordering. Reiterating that you ordered your original dish will simply intimidate them and threaten their income. See how silly that logic is?", "Do you think English makes sense?

Nobody has made a mistake in the story except perhaps OP's wife for trying to correct his pronunciation to fit into American conventions better. (And haven't I heard *that* many times before...) The way I see it, pronouncing a word differently is not a problem or indication of an issue. \n\nAgain, if we follow your line of thought, anything that potentially intimidates the waitress is off-limits. Wore a face mask? You're hiding your face, that's intimidating. Dressed in business clothes? Sounds like you're involved in some serious work, that's intimidating. Flagging her down for a refill? You're implying the waitress should've asked you before that, that's intimidating. Left a dish completely uneaten? Means you weren't satisfied with the food, that's intimidating.

I don't police how people talk. I don't have a problem if they do or don't reconfirm their orders; they can do either and I would not care, as I view both ways as common. Whereas you think people are abnormal for reconfirming their orders, you police how others must talk and assume anyone reconfirming is malicious, and you have a problem if they do reconfirm their orders because you see it as uncommon. That's literally the definition of a narrower viewpoint.\n\nAs for claiming, you claim that I said it was \"more normal to actively say something\". Please point out where I said that. Because I said it was [very common](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kirb3/aita_for_ordering_brooskehtah/jb8it9x/), not that it was \"more common\". Perhaps you are the one with the ridiculous claims here.\n\nAlso I find it hilarious how you tried to take my example and \"made it similar to OP's situation\" when you actually changed the entire premise to make it even more different. I literally stated that I pronounce chow mein a different way than the waitress (I pronounce it a more Chinese way, she pronounces it a more American way), which is the same as what OP does. I reaffirm my own pronunciation, and I do not copy the waitress's different pronunciation when I reconfirm \"Yeah, the chow mein and the teriyaki chicken\". Nobody cares and nobody sees it as \"correcting\". But it seems like you failed to understand that. I have literally no idea how you thought your new analogy was more similar when you changed the entire word and not the pronunciation. Did you misread and think the waitress in OP's story said bread instead of bruschetta?", "NTA. I am from Europe and I wouldn\u2019t even understand what \"bruh-sheh-tuh\" means, I certainly would repeat with more correct pronunciation.
