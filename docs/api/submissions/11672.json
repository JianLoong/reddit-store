Not sure if you ever worked in service before but so many people pronounced things differently from me and I did not give a fuck or feel like they were \"correcting\" me.\n\nAlso, let's say we actually follow your line of thought. If they serve you a different dish, you must never mention it to them because your influence over them will mean that you are intimidating them by \"correcting\" your order and asking for the right dish. You would be contradicting them because that means they brought you the wrong dish. Your memory of your order was more correct than theirs. So you should absolutely never try to get the right dish, and you should override your habit of eating a dish you were comfortable ordering. Reiterating that you ordered your original dish will simply intimidate them and threaten their income. See how silly that logic is?", "Do you think English makes sense?  Sometimes words that come from other languages retain their original pronunciation.  Sometimes they don't.  How do you pronounce the word Mexico?

Do you really not see the difference between those two situations? And how that's different for both parties? Have you never worked customer service? \n\nThere's a big difference between helping a customer with an actual issue and a customer who is making unnecessary problems and indicating to you that they are likely to be an issue. There's a million things that a customer could ask me for help with that would require me to do something but that I wouldn't consider a red flag or extra unnecessary work. This is not one of those million things, for a bunch of reasons", "You do know people say \"Tar-zhay\" as a joke to imply being pretentious right, lmfao?", "I mean yeah I also try to pronounce Mexico correctly because I'm Italian and speak English as a second language, so I don't see why its made up rules should affect how I pronounce other languages.", "I think there's a difference between the 'correct' pronunciation and the 'common' pronunciation. Take the word 'schedule'. I would never dream of correcting an American or anyone else for saying \"sk-edule\" when the *correct* pronunciation is \"sh-edule\". I just continue to say \"sh-edule\" because I'm English and that's how I know to say it. \n\nIf someone said a word in a totally outlandish way, it's fine to explain to them how it's pronounced. If they're using a very common mispronounciation, correcting them makes you seem like a jerk.", "scots-italian fusion .. the next wave to hit the foodie scene", "Or he just repeated to confirm, with what he feels was the correct pronunciation.\n\nThere was literally no reason for him to keep using what he thinks is the incorrect pronunciation.\n\nI have a friend named James.

How do you think if someone told me, no call him James, that\u2019s the American way?", "I don't see any mistake OP made here, so there's nothing to correct. Nobody has made a mistake in the story except perhaps OP's wife for trying to correct his pronunciation to fit into American conventions better. (And haven't I heard *that* many times before...) The way I see it, pronouncing a word differently is not a problem or indication of an issue. \n\nAgain, if we follow your line of thought, anything that potentially intimidates the waitress is off-limits. Wore a face mask? You're hiding your face, that's intimidating. Dressed in business clothes? Sounds like you're involved in some serious work, that's intimidating. Flagging her down for a refill? You're implying the waitress should've asked you before that, that's intimidating. Left a dish completely uneaten? Means you weren't satisfied with the food, that's intimidating. I got a ton more reaches to match your \"pronounced a word differently? you're contradicting her pronunciation, that's intimidating.\"", "My normal is that people may or may not reconfirm their orders. I don't police how people talk. I don't have a problem if they do or don't reconfirm their orders; they can do either and I would not care, as I view both ways as common. Whereas you think people are abnormal for reconfirming their orders, you police how others must talk and assume anyone reconfirming is malicious, and you have a problem if they do reconfirm their orders because you see it as uncommon. That's literally the definition of a narrower viewpoint.\n\nAs for claiming, you claim that I said it was \"more normal to actively say something\". Please point out where I said that. Because I said it was [very common](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kirb3/aita_for_ordering_brooskehtah/jb8it9x/), not that it was \"more common\". Perhaps you are the one with the ridiculous claims here.\n\nAlso I find it hilarious how you tried to take my example and \"made it similar to OP's situation\" when you actually changed the entire premise to make it even more different. I literally stated that I pronounce chow mein a different way than the waitress (I pronounce it a more Chinese way, she pronounces it a more American way), which is the same as what OP does. I reaffirm my own pronunciation, and I do not copy the waitress's different pronunciation when I reconfirm \"Yeah, the chow mein and the teriyaki chicken\". Nobody cares and nobody sees it as \"correcting\". But it seems like you failed to understand that. I have literally no idea how you thought your new analogy was more similar when you changed the entire word and not the pronunciation. Did you misread and think the waitress in OP's story said bread instead of bruschetta?", "NTA. I am from Europe and I wouldn\u2019t even understand what \"bruh-sheh-tuh\" means, I certainly would repeat with more correct pronunciation.

If I told the kids to put the bags in the boot they\u2019d ask how the hell the groceries would fit inside their boots. If I asked a stranger where the trolley was they\u2019d ask me what the hell I was talking about. And this one word isn\u2019t even the tip of the iceberg on words we pronounce differently or \u201cincorrectly\u201d in America when it comes to other languages! We have a culture difference and a different way of speaking. It\u2019s up to you really if you want to keep confusing everyone but please don\u2019t be rude to the waiter. She\u2019s never going to pronounce it like you want because *nobody else does*.", "NAH. I\u2019m an Italian-American so maybe I have a unique take on this. I say no arse simply because everyone\u2019s entitled to their view or take. But I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cregular Joe\u2019s\u201d who try to use Italian pronunciation. (Or Spanish, etc.) I tolerate it (because again, everyone gets their own take), but I cringe. \n\nI guess I see any given culture as a special club.

Honestly, Americans WITH Italian descent are the ones more likely to have learned these things in the USA.", "yes sadly that is the case, reflected perfectly in the \"asshole\" judgement tag on the post.", "LOL I\u2019ve noticed Brits say Spanish words the way Americans say French words and vice versa. The UK has \u201ctack-os\u201d (tacos) and we have Lah Crocks (La Croix).", "Bucca de Beppo is a bit better than described. It's not a world class Michelin star place, but it's hardly McDonald's either.\n\nThey serve family style, so a single \"small\" plate of food is good for two people, three if you eat lighter or grab a salad or soup.\n\nWhile it does go more quantity over quality, it's still a lot closer to a home cooked meal than most people want to admit. It's simple American-Italian which means a lot of cheese, a lot of pasta noodles, and hearty flavors. The biggest issue to have with it is they basically have like six sauces and a half dozen types of pasta. Everything is some mix of the two with choice of cheese and protein. \n\nDon't go there expecting some rare Italian specialty like squid ink pasta with monk fish cutlets. If you want to eat what Tony Soprano or the guys in Goodfellas ate, yeah, this is the place. Basically if you see an Italian American family eating on a movie or TV made in America, Bucca's is the kind of food they have. Red sauce, noodles, and meat.\n\nYes, it is also a chain, but it's hardly everywhere. They have seventy restaurants nation wide (well, two in the Philippines). That's also hardly common enough to be similar to McDonald's where you can find one within miles of each other in some cities.\n\nBut some people want to act like every restaurant needs to be fancy, with bespoke meals made unique for each customer and a menu that only includes fresh food bought daily with dishes that change each meal.", "Yeah, I was confused too! They don't seem to be terribly unpopular (if generally derided for their subpar food) and as I said in another comment there's even one in my state so I don't understand why literally, outside of a single line in a movie from 2009, I've never heard of it.", "Look, their breadstick are endless, and I can get as much cheese on my salad as I want.  What more can I ask for?"]}
