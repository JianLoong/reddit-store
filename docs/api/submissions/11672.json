She told me she wanted the \"per-mar-zee-en\" on a particular part of her plate, then told me she'd had enough \"per-mar-zee-en\". She definitely used the word many more times than was necessary. Each time she said it, she added that pompous condescending look, sneering at me that I clearly didn't know how to pronounce parmesan.

I was saying it's ***not common*** to repeat what someone else has already repeated of you. It's redundant and unnecessary to do that, and I'm not sure how you can claim my argument for NOT saying those redundant and unnecessary things \"is not other people's normal\". Like you're trying to claim it's more normal to actively say something than to just not say it? I don't know if that's true *anywhere*, much less here. \n\nAlso, the context with OP's situation is not purely just repeating the word the same way, it's actually extremely important that what he said was *different*. The waitress pronounced the word he used differently, and he then repeated back and reaffirmed ***his*** pronunciation. Taking your example, everything you mentioned was the same being repeated back and forth. If instead, it was slightly different and more similar to OP: \n\n>\"hey can I get a bowl of chow mein with teriyaki chicken.\"\n\n>\"~~Chow mein~~ Noodles with teriyaki?\"\n\n>\"Yeah, the chow mein and the teriyaki chicken\"\n\nIsn't the last comment you made trying to make a point there?

He said the word, she repeated it over, he repeated the same word over. Two *overs*, that's what happened, that's what I said. I don't know why a legitimate comment causes you to quit the discussion, just sounds like you really have nothing better to add and can't support your own argument."]}
