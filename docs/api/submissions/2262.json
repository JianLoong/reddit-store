Communication is key.\n\nEdited to add: it is better to turn down the invitation entirely than to bring your own food, which is usually a sign that you think your host will harm or poison you.

Vegans and vegetarians can't say I have many good experience with either, definitely not saying everyone is the same. Just my experiences.", "I am sorry you are dealing with that. Vegan cooking is so freaking easy it's insane. All a person has to do is keep the Big Five on hand: vegan broth, olive oil, rice, canned beans, and vegetable oil. Then a person can cook vegan with less than an hour of notice. Rice plus beans makes a complete protein and then it's just a soup or salad, some vegetable sides, and a dessert. Maybe fruit salad. Labels must be checked and obviously there can't be eggs or dairy. All butter is swapped out for margarine or vegetable oil and all eggs are swapped with soy lecithin or mustard depending on the kind of emulsifier.\n\nIf I were in the OP's position I would not go to the trouble of cooking and bringing my own meal. I would turn down the invitation. It would be impossible for me to enjoy a meal with someone who had repeatedly expressed an intention to harm me. Making an extra effort to accommodate such a person seems unwise to me.", "Also do you understand CONSENT?

Other friends of mine with chronic illnesses have heard the same. I'm glad you haven't heard it. Tbh it is ridiculous.

So nta.\nMy wife has some significant gastric issues. Eating can be quite painful for her. It was a huge learning curve,  figuring it out. I think I have a ton of gray hair from it, because at one point,  she was so skeletal, it scared me silly. But we learned a great deal about food. Primarily that if your body grows accustomed to doing without a certain thing but it well compensated in others, trying to eat that one thing again after years of not can have dire consequences. That can and do result in medical distress.\nAlso,  a lot of people don't realize all of the crap that gets added to our food, meat especially,  to make it look \"pretty\" in the packaging at the stores. When we started researching what was behind my wife's sensitivity, we were absolutely shocked and disgusted by some of the stuff we found out. We stopped buying meat from grocery stores and found a fresh, local butcher. We stopped buying eggs from the grocery stores and found a local plant nursery with their own flock that sells the eggs. The difference? The eggs in the grocery stores are already stale and weeks old while the nursery eggs are fresh daily.  We pay a little bit more per pound and per dozen, but my wife's not puking after every meal. \nDefinitely nta. And take your own food.", "NTA.
