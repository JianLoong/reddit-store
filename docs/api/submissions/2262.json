I\u2019m not vegetarian or vegan and while I can understand why someone would choose it, I like meat. With that, I have much respect for you.

Look him straight in the eyes and say that you believe him when he said he would sneak meat into your food. And then ask him if he is a liar?", "NTA since he has threatened to contaminate your food. Twice. This is the exact opposite of what a good host does. A good host makes sure that the guests' needs are accommodated and works around their dietary restrictions. If there is a particular menu item that can't be made safe it needs to be obvious. Communication is key.\n\nEdited to add: it is better to turn down the invitation entirely than to bring your own food, which is usually a sign that you think your host will harm or poison you. Which he has threatened to do, twice. He already self identified as someone who intends to harm you, so behaving like you believe him is not rude.", "\"You told me you would give me food that, as someone who has never eaten meat, would make me physically ill.

Losing my trust was a choice you made.\"\n\nI'd keep that boundary, OP, especially with your bf taking it as seriously as you are since I assume he knows his brother pretty well.

Vegans are the ones who are pretty damn preachy about their diet choices.  \n\nVegetarians don\u2019t really care too much whether you eat meat or not. We just don\u2019t want to. Nor should we be tricked into it. Hence OP partner still eats meat. Just like my hubby and child and cats still eat meat. It\u2019s my choice not to eat meat, just like it\u2019s their choice to eat it. And yours obviously.

It's the trickery that is so upsetting. If you have to keep eating around this creep, keep bringing your own food.", "I regularly engage in shenanigans.  Like brushing your teeth...minimum 2x per day!", "Oh absolutely no one should be tricked into eating anything they aren't comfortable with and her BIL sounds like someone who might. Vegans and vegetarians can't say I have many good experience with either, definitely not saying everyone is the same. Just my experiences.", "I am sorry you are dealing with that. Vegan cooking is so freaking easy it's insane. All a person has to do is keep the Big Five on hand: vegan broth, olive oil, rice, canned beans, and vegetable oil. Then a person can cook vegan with less than an hour of notice. Rice plus beans makes a complete protein and then it's just a soup or salad, some vegetable sides, and a dessert. Maybe fruit salad. Labels must be checked and obviously there can't be eggs or dairy. All butter is swapped out for margarine or vegetable oil and all eggs are swapped with soy lecithin or mustard depending on the kind of emulsifier.\n\nIf I were in the OP's position I would not go to the trouble of cooking and bringing my own meal. I would turn down the invitation. It would be impossible for me to enjoy a meal with someone who had repeatedly expressed an intention to harm me. Making an extra effort to accommodate such a person seems unwise to me.", "Also do you understand CONSENT? I told him explicitly that I dont want to eat meat, forcing me to try it goes against it.", "So, she is never supposed to participate in any of these family gatherings? She is always supposed decline?", "I declare... shenanigans!!! *lifts broom*", "Okay, I laughed at that image.", "NTA. He threatened you and you believed him.

Why wouldn't you bring your own food, after he said he wanted to trick you?", "NTA\n\nWith those comments you can't feel safe eating the veggy options. Bring your own food.", "NTA. If he can't stop threatening you, why would you trust his food?", "He is outright telling you that you cannot trust him. Believe him.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t shut the fuck up then stop going to his house for dinner, he intends to hurt you, do not consent \n\nNTA", "You could easily get violently ill from eating the slightest bit of meat since you\u2019ve always been vegetarian. Your BILs comment isn\u2019t funny or cute it\u2019s literally a threat, and the fact that he was upset you brought your own is weird af to me. Like you\u2019re mad you didn\u2019t get the chance to poison me???", "Am I the only one who thinks he was mad because he'd tampered with *that night's meal* and OP wasn't going to eat it? \n\nHe couldn't deal with the disappointment of not being able to tell OP that he'd \"cured\" their vegetarianism and \"proven\" that meat is awesome, after going out of his way to tamper with the food, hence he had a tantrum.", "Did he intentionally have you eat it knowing there was lard in them or was he just ignorant about the ingredients and made a mistake? \n\nSeems kind of shitty on your part to end a friendship if it was the latter.", "Yeah this is exactly where my mind went as well - he gave her 2 warnings that he was going to do it,   OP paid attention and brought her own food..  the dude flipped out because his plan failed.\n\nIf someone 'jokes' about doing something once,  i may let it slide depending on what they're saying and who's saying it,   but if they say it twice,  it's not a joke - they actually want to do it and that's my cue to nope out.", "He did it intentionally.", "I've unfortunately had a few try to push me to stop eating all meat and even blame my cancer on my eating meat. Other friends of mine with chronic illnesses have heard the same. I'm glad you haven't heard it. Tbh it is ridiculous. Let people eat as they choose without judgment as long as children are fed nutritionally complete meals which can be vegan or vegetarian or omnivore. The recent push I got on food was that I needed to do an all raw food or liquid vegan fruit diet. Which I doubt is healthy for anyone.", "NTA. Your BIL has definitely tampered with the food he was going to serve you. As a lifelong vegetarian, this makes me angry on your behalf, OP.", "I don't understand why you would go there at all", "NTA.

More for the personal health benefits than for any moral reason so I guess I was plant based rather than fully vegan. I joined a few online groups and even dated a vegan for a while and while it doesn\u2019t apply to all of them there were more than a few toxic members of the group. The girl I was dating outright told me she was only interested in me because I was vegan and lived reasonably nearby, we didn\u2019t last long (shocker) but she did have an air of superiority to how she acted and spoke purely based on her being vegan. \n\nNot every veggie/ vegan I\u2019ve met has lived up to the stereotype but I did meet more than a few that seemed to make it their entire personality.", "You're allergic to most vegetables, fruit, pulses and grains?", "Probably the meat substitutes. So many are soy based, or used to be. They've come a long way the past few years.", "No his brother sounds like a MAJOR AH for that.

This is likely where BIL fits in; he probably thinks that OP is judging him for eating meat despite there being no evidence of that. Hiding something in their food is seeing as having outsmarted the person, and bringing them down.\n\nThere are also people who don't understand or deliberately ignore science, who don't believe, for example, that allergies are real and need to prove themselves \"correct\". They risk people's lives on purpose so they can avoid confronting their inaccurate beliefs.\n\nThere are those who are cruel, vengeful or sadistic who get off on hiding bodily fluids, poison etc. Thankfully those are rare, but unfortunately they still exist.\n\nNone of it truly makes sense.
