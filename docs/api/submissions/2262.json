Bring your own food.  He will try to sneak me in and think he is in the right to fool you.  Do not trust him.  If he complains, tell him you are taking him at his word.", "NTA. What did his BIL expect?", "NTA , they want to host you without catering to your needs and get mad when you bring your own food ? Should you starve ?", "NTA \n\nBesides being extremely rude. He is disrespecting you. Not to mention, feeding you \"hidden\" animal products will most likely make you ill.\n\nBIL is TA.", "Consuming meat after a life without would be disastrous.  BIL has stated twice he's going to tamper with the food he serves you.  Why take the chance.  NTA but BIL sure is a huge one.", "NTA. If someone told me they would sneak meat or a food allergen into my food as a joke I would never eat food they served again. I'd be hard pressed to go to their house as a guest, even. At least you were nice enough to do that.", "NTA, your bf's BIL sucks and is an AH for saying he's gonna force you to eat meat against your will.", "Nope NTA. He isn't trust worthy at that point and better to bring your own. It's common for vegetarians/vegans to bring their own meals places where it's not certain. BIL is a massive jerk.   \n\n\nAnd just...ugh. I've been vegetarian for 24+ years and that kind of attitude unfortunately isn't uncommon. I don't know why some meat eaters take such offence to someone not wanting to eat meat. It's really childish.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t trust eating there for a second. Bare minimum you should bring your own protein, and only eat things that very obviously don\u2019t have pieces of meat (mashed/baked potato, corn on the cob, etc.) but it is totally fair to not trust anything he makes and not touch any of it.", " NTA, on the other hand BIL is a huge one", "NTA.    His family is degrading you.  If you can not trust them with what they are serving then bring your own food.  If they think it is funny to trick you into eating meat then they are the ones with issues.", "NTA. My son in law is a vegetarian, we are not. I try very hard to respect this and have something for him to eat when they come over, but sometimes he just says he\u2019ll bring his own. It should be a non issue, especially if you are the only vegetarian.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why people are so pressed about others\u2019 food preferences. I\u2019d be relieved if you brought food for you to eat because I would be so afraid to make something you didn\u2019t like and then you\u2019d be hungry and I\u2019d feel awful. BIL is the AH and needs a class on consent", "NTA and in all honesty i would stop going to his house for dinner altogether.", "Okay wow... I don't mean to make assumptions but the way BIL was talking about his \"plan\" to \"convert\" you was frankly... very creepy!!! I don't get this type of attitude specifically because of living with my vegan stepmother who was so strict about no meat in the house... turns out one of the only proteins I can eat without stomach or bodily discomfort IS red meat- and she was practically making me sick every single day... \n\nYou can't just decide you're going to \"convert\" somebody to a different diet and if he's angry about vegetarian or vegan extremists- what he's doing is WAY off-kilter and just as bad... you're NTA OP... your BIL is weirdly obsessive over this and it's not good... gives me icky vibes...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tf is wrong with him", "I\u2019ll have to disagree with most everyone here.\n\nEveryone is the AH here, not just you.\n\n#1 - As a host, you have an obligation to make a reasonable attempt to honor your guests likes, dislikes, allergies etc.  Your BIL didn\u2019t do this, that why he\u2019s the AH!\n\n#2 - As a guest, you have a responsibility to treat your host respectfully.  You eat what they serve.  It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to pass on what they serve or to politely decline the invitation.\n\nFeel as you do, you should have politely declined the invitation - after a few declines the message would get through.\n\nIt\u2019s a slap in the face to your host, to bring your own food to a dinner, that\u2019s why your the AH too.", "Also, I think a ruckus is only acceptable if you are 98 and the nursing home is serving crappy canned low-sodium green beans on corn day.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_caMQpiwiaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_caMQpiwiaU)", "Or people that don't believe that people have allergies and try to feed them the allergen.", "\u201cTo eat meat like a \u2018normal\u2019 person!\u201d", "Probably because vegetarians make a big deal about their diet choices and shame meat eaters just as much.", "Naah, he said he would start with using fat from meat because you can use that as a substitute for oil while making food.\n\nedit - I am really that scared. getting food from outside is my last resort", "I hope this is satire because how can you expect me to trust someone after they said they would tamper my food?\n\nit is better for me to starve than bring my own food?", "So a vegetarian is never supposed to go to a family dinner if they don\u2019t serve any non-meat options? I don\u2019t agree with this idea.", "Sorry, but absolutely not. If your host KNOWS your dietary restrictions and has threatened to tamper with your food, it's completely reasonable not to trust anything they've prepared, and it's nonsense to expect OP to sit there hungry out of some misguided sense of etiquette. The only AH here is the tool who thinks that forcing meat on people is funny.", "I couldn\u2019t care less if they eat meat or not, its their choice, I just dont want them to force me to do something that I dont want to do.", "I've literally never met a vegetarian or vegan who lived up to this stereotype, but I've heard DOZENS of militant carnivores make this complaint about them, which is infinitely more irritating.", "Bull. Never once have and none that I know are that way either. Some social justice warrior vegans online sure.

He is awful and nothing he makes can be trusted. Your only option is bringing your own meal. That is his own fault, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised\n\nI\u2019m vegan and I hate people like this that claim they will \u201ctrick\u201d me. For a while when it was new my uncle and some neighbors would always offer meat and be like \u201cyou know you want it\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t tell\u201d \u201cjust a little\u201d\n\nAlso had times when people forget and use like dairy butter in mashed potatoes or cook veggies in it and will be like \u201ccan\u2019t you just deal with it this one time\u201d all annoyed.\n\nIt\u2019s so disrespectful. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with that.", "Like I said, you\u2019re best move was to decline the invitation.\n\nStarve?

The only part about the evening that I dont like is dinner. I can either leave or not eat dinner which makes everyone uncomfortable . This is the easiest way for both me and them.

He's awful and I hope your BF is sticking up for you.", "NTA\n\nIf BIL continues to complain, tell him that he has left you with two options.\n\n1. You believe that he would deliberately sabotage your food, which has both ethical and health implications for you.\n2. He is a liar.\n\nWhich one would he rather  you believe? If he starts saying \"It was just a joke\", then let him know that there is a third option:  \n3. He is a bully.  \n \"You can't take a joke\" is the calling cry of the bully who masks his behaviour behind 'humour'.\n\nSeeing as you think he is a man of his word, you have no option other than to take his intent to sabotage/hurt/humiliate you out of his hands and are taking care of your own food from now on.", "NTA - if people threaten to tamper with your food - you should not eat whah they are trying to serve you.", "NTA. The brother is being an AH for even attempting and making the notions that he's going to do it on more than one occasion.", "NTA\u2014 your BIL started this with his threats to feed you meat without your consent. I would bring my own food there as well. He can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a vegetarian, but isn\u2019t a possibility that you could get really sick if you eat meat when you aren\u2019t used to eating? I thought I read that on here before.", "NTA. In many circles, it is rude to come to a dinner gathering empty handed. You did nothing wrong and BIL is a jerk.", "NTA.  I\u2019m not vegetarian or vegan and while I can understand why someone would choose it, I like meat. With that, I have much respect for you. You have a diet that you stand by and instead of demanding others to adhere to your choices you do what you need to do to accommodate your choice.  Much props.", "NTA. Look him straight in the eyes and say that you believe him when he said he would sneak meat into your food. And then ask him if he is a liar?", "NTA since he has threatened to contaminate your food. Twice. This is the exact opposite of what a good host does. A good host makes sure that the guests' needs are accommodated and works around their dietary restrictions. If there is a particular menu item that can't be made safe it needs to be obvious. Communication is key.\n\nEdited to add: it is better to turn down the invitation entirely than to bring your own food, which is usually a sign that you think your host will harm or poison you. Which he has threatened to do, twice. He already self identified as someone who intends to harm you, so behaving like you believe him is not rude.", "\"You told me you would give me food that, as someone who has never eaten meat, would make me physically ill. You told me that you would lie to me about what I was eating. You told me your plan for easily hiding what you were talking about doing. It is not my fault that I believe the words you chose to say. Losing my trust was a choice you made.\"\n\nI'd keep that boundary, OP, especially with your bf taking it as seriously as you are since I assume he knows his brother pretty well. I wouldn't put it past the brother to play nice to earn your trust and actually go through with it, especially since he actually threw a tantrum about you taking action to protect yourself. NTA", "This happened to me. Friend told me he learned to make tortillas at home and then after dinner showed me the package he bought, and it had lard in it. Needless to say the friendship ended right there and then.\n\nNTA. BIL is a jerk.", "NTA. No way that I\u2019d trust him to not try to give you food with meat in it.", "I would turn the invitation down entirely.", "Yes, I would believe BIL, he sounds like a massive A H. But you are NTA, OP. I can't understand why people try to control others' food.", "Exactly. If he is the host it's only a matter of time before he makes good on his threat. If he is a fellow guest, the hosts have chosen to let him continue to threaten you and to not protect you, so they clearly condone what he's doing.", "I didnt even know that until some people pointed out in the thread today", "So if someone serves you a plate of shit you eat it, right?", "A ruckus is like shenanigans and running amok: I hope someday to participate in glorious fashion!", "Actually you are thinking of vegans. Vegans are the ones who are pretty damn preachy about their diet choices.  \n\nVegetarians don\u2019t really care too much whether you eat meat or not. We just don\u2019t want to. Nor should we be tricked into it. Hence OP partner still eats meat. Just like my hubby and child and cats still eat meat. It\u2019s my choice not to eat meat, just like it\u2019s their choice to eat it. And yours obviously. But we don\u2019t need arseholes tricking us to eat meat, when we don\u2019t wish too.", "Look, I do eat some meat, but if someone threatened to sneak something into my food (even if it was something I would normally eat) I'd never trust them again. It's the trickery that is so upsetting. If you have to keep eating around this creep, keep bringing your own food.", "I regularly engage in shenanigans.  Like brushing your teeth...minimum 2x per day!", "Oh absolutely no one should be tricked into eating anything they aren't comfortable with and her BIL sounds like someone who might. Vegans and vegetarians can't say I have many good experience with either, definitely not saying everyone is the same. Just my experiences.", "I am sorry you are dealing with that. Vegan cooking is so freaking easy it's insane. All a person has to do is keep the Big Five on hand: vegan broth, olive oil, rice, canned beans, and vegetable oil. Then a person can cook vegan with less than an hour of notice. Rice plus beans makes a complete protein and then it's just a soup or salad, some vegetable sides, and a dessert. Maybe fruit salad. Labels must be checked and obviously there can't be eggs or dairy. All butter is swapped out for margarine or vegetable oil and all eggs are swapped with soy lecithin or mustard depending on the kind of emulsifier.\n\nIf I were in the OP's position I would not go to the trouble of cooking and bringing my own meal. I would turn down the invitation. It would be impossible for me to enjoy a meal with someone who had repeatedly expressed an intention to harm me. Making an extra effort to accommodate such a person seems unwise to me.", "Also do you understand CONSENT? I told him explicitly that I dont want to eat meat, forcing me to try it goes against it.", "So, she is never supposed to participate in any of these family gatherings? She is always supposed decline?", "I declare... shenanigans!!! *lifts broom*", "Okay, I laughed at that image."]}
