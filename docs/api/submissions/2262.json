At this point you eating meat can cause you to become sick", "NTA.  He is promising to cross your boundaries.  You don't think it is funny.  I would never want to eat there again.", "NTA. Bring your own food.  He will try to sneak me in and think he is in the right to fool you.  Do not trust him.  If he complains, tell him you are taking him at his word.", "NTA. What did his BIL expect?", "NTA , they want to host you without catering to your needs and get mad when you bring your own food ? Should you starve ?", "NTA \n\nBesides being extremely rude. He is disrespecting you. Not to mention, feeding you \"hidden\" animal products will most likely make you ill.\n\nBIL is TA.", "Consuming meat after a life without would be disastrous.  BIL has stated twice he's going to tamper with the food he serves you.  Why take the chance.  NTA but BIL sure is a huge one.", "NTA. If someone told me they would sneak meat or a food allergen into my food as a joke I would never eat food they served again. I'd be hard pressed to go to their house as a guest, even. At least you were nice enough to do that.", "NTA, your bf's BIL sucks and is an AH for saying he's gonna force you to eat meat against your will.", "Nope NTA. He isn't trust worthy at that point and better to bring your own. It's common for vegetarians/vegans to bring their own meals places where it's not certain. BIL is a massive jerk.   \n\n\nAnd just...ugh. I've been vegetarian for 24+ years and that kind of attitude unfortunately isn't uncommon. I don't know why some meat eaters take such offence to someone not wanting to eat meat. It's really childish.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t trust eating there for a second. Bare minimum you should bring your own protein, and only eat things that very obviously don\u2019t have pieces of meat (mashed/baked potato, corn on the cob, etc.) but it is totally fair to not trust anything he makes and not touch any of it.", " NTA, on the other hand BIL is a huge one", "NTA.    His family is degrading you.  If you can not trust them with what they are serving then bring your own food.  If they think it is funny to trick you into eating meat then they are the ones with issues.", "NTA. My son in law is a vegetarian, we are not. I try very hard to respect this and have something for him to eat when they come over, but sometimes he just says he\u2019ll bring his own. It should be a non issue, especially if you are the only vegetarian.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why people are so pressed about others\u2019 food preferences. I\u2019d be relieved if you brought food for you to eat because I would be so afraid to make something you didn\u2019t like and then you\u2019d be hungry and I\u2019d feel awful. BIL is the AH and needs a class on consent", "NTA and in all honesty i would stop going to his house for dinner altogether.", "Okay wow... I don't mean to make assumptions but the way BIL was talking about his \"plan\" to \"convert\" you was frankly... very creepy!!! I don't get this type of attitude specifically because of living with my vegan stepmother who was so strict about no meat in the house... turns out one of the only proteins I can eat without stomach or bodily discomfort IS red meat- and she was practically making me sick every single day... \n\nYou can't just decide you're going to \"convert\" somebody to a different diet and if he's angry about vegetarian or vegan extremists- what he's doing is WAY off-kilter and just as bad... you're NTA OP... your BIL is weirdly obsessive over this and it's not good... gives me icky vibes...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tf is wrong with him", "I\u2019ll have to disagree with most everyone here.\n\nEveryone is the AH here, not just you.\n\n#1 - As a host, you have an obligation to make a reasonable attempt to honor your guests likes, dislikes, allergies etc.  Your BIL didn\u2019t do this, that why he\u2019s the AH!\n\n#2 - As a guest, you have a responsibility to treat your host respectfully.  You eat what they serve.  It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to pass on what they serve or to politely decline the invitation.\n\nFeel as you do, you should have politely declined the invitation - after a few declines the message would get through.\n\nIt\u2019s a slap in the face to your host, to bring your own food to a dinner, that\u2019s why your the AH too.", "Also, I think a ruckus is only acceptable if you are 98 and the nursing home is serving crappy canned low-sodium green beans on corn day.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_caMQpiwiaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_caMQpiwiaU)", "Or people that don't believe that people have allergies and try to feed them the allergen.", "\u201cTo eat meat like a \u2018normal\u2019 person!\u201d", "Probably because vegetarians make a big deal about their diet choices and shame meat eaters just as much.", "Naah, he said he would start with using fat from meat because you can use that as a substitute for oil while making food.\n\nedit - I am really that scared. getting food from outside is my last resort", "I hope this is satire because how can you expect me to trust someone after they said they would tamper my food?\n\nit is better for me to starve than bring my own food?", "So a vegetarian is never supposed to go to a family dinner if they don\u2019t serve any non-meat options? I don\u2019t agree with this idea.", "Sorry, but absolutely not. If your host KNOWS your dietary restrictions and has threatened to tamper with your food, it's completely reasonable not to trust anything they've prepared, and it's nonsense to expect OP to sit there hungry out of some misguided sense of etiquette. The only AH here is the tool who thinks that forcing meat on people is funny.", "I couldn\u2019t care less if they eat meat or not, its their choice, I just dont want them to force me to do something that I dont want to do.", "I've literally never met a vegetarian or vegan who lived up to this stereotype, but I've heard DOZENS of militant carnivores make this complaint about them, which is infinitely more irritating.", "Bull.

That is his own fault, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised\n\nI\u2019m vegan and I hate people like this that claim they will \u201ctrick\u201d me.
