We have a 1 and a half year old son together and her death hit me really hard. So my wife was American and I'm Austrian went to uni in Germany moved here for work. Our son was born while we still lived with her parents and they got used to having him around. Even when we moved out we lived very close. After her death they have been very clingy to our son as one would expect but they dont want me to take him back and are reluctant to give him up. My wife was really my only friend in this country and now that I don't have her I really need the support of my family and of my parents and siblings. When I told my in laws that I wanted to move back to Germany they exploded and shouted at me telling me I couldn't take him away. I do feel bad but I really need the support of my family right now.

Your child is all they have left of their daughter, so it's understandable they don't want to let go. At the same time, they aren't thinking about your health and what's best for you. And you need to be healthy, mental wise, in order to take proper care of your child. Perhaps try and schedule some future visits with them now, so they don't feel you are abandoning them an have something to look forward to.", "NTA, it's understandable that they're hurt but they can't expect you to live there just so they can see their grandson, that just doesn't make sense.

Keep them in contact with them via video chats and encourage them to visit you in Austria.", "NTA\n\nYour in laws are allowed to feel sad and upset, but you are the parent, not them. You get to decide where you and your child live, and I think it\u2019s great your son would get to spend time with his other relatives. I\u2019d maybe suggest setting up regular calls with the in laws so they still feel connected to their grandchild.", "I feel like I could explain my situation a lot better I have been thinking of moving back for a month now and the only thing stopping me is guilt towards my in laws. If I moved back to Germany not only would I be with my family but I would have a lot more financial security I would get a salary 3\u00d7 higher than my current one and my parents who are upper middle class would be able to support me help me get a house. My son could go to private school and have university payed for. My job is for an American company and I was offered a post in Germany a year ago but declined because of my wife and son but now it feels like an ideal situation. This job does allow me to come back to the states fairly often and I can bring my son to stay with his grandparents and ofcourse they are welcome to visit. Sorry if that was unclear I do feel alot of guilt by making this decision but I think it is best for me and subsequently my son but I can't stop feeling devastated for my in laws.

Everyone needs a support system.", "\"I understand that you are grieving too, but you need to understand that this behavior is *not* acceptable. I cannot and will not allow my son to watch his only remaining parent get berated by people who claim to care about him. If you truly care about my son and want to remain a part of his life--which I hope you do as I *want* him to hear you tell him stories about his mom--you need to recognize that I am his father. And in order to be the best father I can be to him right now, I need the support of *my* family, which means returning home to Germany. Once we get settled in, I hope we can plan for you to come visit us.\"\n\nNTA. The world is much smaller than it used to be and there is absolutely nothing stopping them from remaining part of your son's life.

Please take good care of your son during this difficult transition... He lost his mother, which is absolutely devastating, especially for a young child. He will have a difficult time separating from his grandparents. I would suggest involving some form of early childhood intervention and/or a psychologist from an early age, as attachment disorder is of huge concern here. He will need a lot of attention, love, and grace from you as a parent. Focus on him, take a lot of time to really bond with him at an emotional level, and make him feel secure in every way. You two have a lot of healing that needs to be done. Best wishes.", "NAH, this is just gutting for everyone. I'm so sorry.

A mentally healthier dad means a more stable life for kiddo.", "NAH. This is sad all around.\n\nOf course you should go home. You need the support,  but I feel sorry for your in-laws as well, as they loose their link to their daughter. \n\nWould yearly visits be an option? Perhaps Thanksgiving, as that is an American holiday, not a German one. And lots of calls...", "NTA.  What's best for you is what's best for your son.  Your rights and preferences come before those of the grandparents.  Also, the fact that they \"exploded\" and shouted indicates that they are not mature, balanced people to be caring for an infant.  Be with the safe people in Germany who love you.", "NTA.  Please do what you need for your well-being.  You and your child deserve to be surrounded by people who love and support you.  It's the 21st century, and if your in-laws want to stay connected to your son they can, it just won't be the way they imagined, and that's ok.", "NAH. shitty situation for all of you, I am so sorry for your loss. The grandparents being upset is completely understandable, and you have to do what's best for your kid.", "NAH, it's a terrible situation and I'm sorry you're experiencing it. I can understand why they would be upset for their grandkid to move so far away, especially if they cannot afford to travel. But the fact is that you are the parent and your needs come first. And if you need the comfort of your home, then that's what your son needs too.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks. However you need to do what you need to do to make sure you can be what your son needs. \n\nAside from visits, there are all sorts of ways to keep in touch electronically. My friend got a device for her son that mounts to the television. That way the toddler can be running around the room doing whatever and the grandparents can see it all even when the toddler doesn\u2019t want to sit still in front of the phone. The toddler can look at the big tv and communicate with the grandparents. \n\nPlease try to speak with your son in both languages so he can easily communicate with them. \n\nIt will be hard but it can be done if everyone tries to keep it going. Good luck.", "NAH. Your son is your child and his place is with you. You're allowed to move back to Germany. Your in-laws can keep in touch, visit and video call. You can also visit back in the US regularly if it works for you. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH, yet. And I mean them not you on that yet part. You are more than allowed to do what is best for you and your son. If that's moving back to Germany than so be it. I would however after they've had some time to calm down explain everything to them and that all 3 of you need to work as a team to maintain the relationship between them and your son. Skype calls, visits to Germany by them, visits to the US by you and him etc.  Explain that this doesn't have to be a fight and that you want to work with them. \n\nThat said depending on how deep they are in their grief, be prepared for a potential legal battle.", "NTA. It's YOUR son. They don't get to dictate what you decide for your family", "No. NTA. You need your folks, who are also your kid's folks. Your in-laws' response is perfectly reasonable -- your kiddo is a connection to their daughter.  But that doesn't mean you have to live nearby for the rest of your life. \n\nAlso, I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH. They are grieving and lashing out.

I get that the grandparents are heartbroken, but they're GRANDPARENTS. I'm sure he's not going to stop them from coming to visit. He is this child's only living parent. Contrary to what Americans seem to think, lots of people live wonderful, happy lives in other countries. He wants to GO HOME. Home is not the United States. He wants to take HIS child home, to be raised surrounded by family, in a perfectly safe, supportive environment. \n\nThere is literally no legitimate argument against his doing that. As a widower and single parent he feels like he has no reason to stay in the U.S. and no comparative support system. In Germany he and his child would be surrounded by family and friends. \n\nI get that it's going to be incredibly difficult for the maternal grandparents, but it would be inappropriate to demand that he stay with their grandchild solely for their sake. They should look into creating a visiting schedule, and get grief counseling.", "OP is the parent. His former in-laws are not. They don\u2019t need a mediator.

The mediator helps them organize their ideas, basically. They will help set up a visitation schedule. They can assist in getting grief counseling.

It\u2019s about their sadness and grief.", "That's some bullshit. No, the person on the receiving end does not deserve to be mistreated, that's the literal definition of abuse. It can be a one time thing or continuous, it doesn't matter why. At the point that they point it at him, they are the AH- no excuses. They can offer that excuse when they apologize, but even if it is an explanation, it does not excuse the behavior. They are holding him emotional hostage to the point that he has turned to AITA for permission to take his child home FFS.\n\nETA- Further- they are selfishly refusing to acknowledge OP's own grief and his needs, considering only their own. One hopes they get a grip and beg for forgiveness which OP sounds like he would most certainly give, but absent that- there's no way to know that they won't take unhinged actions and try to prevent OP from leaving with his son. He absolutely should not trust them at this point.", "A one-time blow up isn\u2019t holding anyone hostage. Nor is it selfishly refusing to acknowledge someone else\u2019s grief.
