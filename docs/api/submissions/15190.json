She decided to \u201cpunish\u201d you by never telling you her troubles ever again. Sounds like you came out ok on this one.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward: you\u2019re not in a position to support her, you\u2019ve expressed that to her and she chose not to listen", "NTA - your friend needs to understand the idea of \"emotional labour\" and how not everyone is cool with carrying it all of the time.", "NTA, but you\u2019ve shown us that you\u2019re her friend. What has she done, especially in recent times, to show she\u2019s yours? You told her your mental health isn\u2019t that great, and her response wasn\u2019t to support you but continue to add to your burden. It seems like a very one-sided friendship.", "NTA  \nYou made it clear that it was affecting you.  \nIf she couldn't pick it up from you directly telling her she is the AH.  \nAnd if she did realize, yet went on complaining and is now mad that you left her on read.....even bigger AH.", "NTA. These constant whiners are exhausting.", "NTA. She is just dumping on you- you are not her therapist. This is not good for you.", "NTA - This has a caveat, one that I wish I had known at your age. Communicate directly. Have the uncomfortable conversation establishing your boundaries. Tell her that you love her and you do care, but there will be times that you will not be able to be her primary support. There will also be times where you can! But if you tell her that you are mentally not in a place to be her support, you will tell her, and she will respect that. You can also tell her that the inverse is true. If she's ever in a place where she can't shoulder your stresses, she can have the same boundary. Understand that she is allowed to be frustrated that some days she will need to find someone else to confide in, but that is ok, if it means that, as friends, you respect each other's boundaries.\nHave this conversation on even ground. Don't start this conversation when you're overwhelmed or angry, just an average day, so everyone is able to have a level headed, reasonable conversation.\nIt'll be a little weird, but the sooner you get good at defining your boundaries, the healthier all of your relationships will become.", "NTA, but she needs to understand that the world doesn't revolve around her.", "NTA. You told her you didn\u2019t feel talking about it at the moment and she just ignored your request. I had a friend like this that complained about EVERYTHING, for example: if she didn\u2019t found milk at the store she would complain about it for DAYS! So i understand completely your decision to start cutting you listening time.", "NTA. \n\nRecently, I saw this screenshot of a chat where the friend would ask first if the other is in the right mental state for her to rant. And how it's important to also think of the person you're ranting to. \n\nDon't have the link to that screenshot now. I'll see if I can find it and send it over. But if you can find that screenshot and send it to her, it might get through to her what to do first before ranting.", "NTA.\n\nPeople get paid for what you\u2019re doing, it's called a therapist. Suggest to her she gets a therapist and not use you as one", "NTA. I dealt with this with a best friend too. He would talk to me about EVERY LITTLE ISSUE in his life to the point where I sat him down and explained how much of a toll it's taking on me and how one sided our relationship is and has been. It's hard like, we all have our own issues but we're supposed to now take ON ALL THEIR STUFF TOO???? Like, please why am I talking to my therapist about YOUR problems???? I have issues that are being put on the back burner because you have to be put first?!\n\nDefinitely speak to them again with intentions to set a healthy boundary with them, but let them be known they're loved and cared for. It's okay to talk and express your feelings with me, but not in this unhealthy toxic way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your family and friends do want to help you and holding them inside is unhealthy and will only keep causing you unhappiness.", "NTA. \nYour own mental peace is important and if someone keeps spewing venom for their own selfish interest, it is best to move away. Self love is super important", "NTA.  You asked for space and specifically not to talk about this topic, and she brought it up anyway.  You say you listen to her all the time... is this really all she talks about? Just problems in her life?  You're a friend, not a therapist.  I mean, come ON, even when I'm having a bad week at work even I still wanna talk about Grogu sometimes", "NTA \n\nI had a friend like this who did this to me every single phone call. It was weighing on my mental health because, like you, I don't talk about my problems as much as I listen to others issues, so I just stopped answering as much. If you don't nip it in the bud now It'll just get worse and erode your own mental health.", "NTA. You're not her therapist and she's an energy  vampire.", "Everythingwentbetterthanexpected.jpg", "I really like this advice. It\u2019s thoughtful and clear. I think when most people think about how they navigate and grow in relationships, they often only focus on romantic relationships. So many learnings about respect, boundaries, and communication can apply to all types of relationships."]}
