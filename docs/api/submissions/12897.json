That's saying something. \n\nHow dare she disrespect you like that after you gave her a place to stay. I'd be livid too.

She deliberately destroyed a project you had been working on for years. I would have done more then kick her out.", "NTA Her only hope? What about your parents? If they're so concerned about her then why don't they let her stay with them? You allowed her to stay with you while she tried to get back on her feet and she paid you back by destroying your property. She's an adult who made her own bed.

Your sister sounds like she has mental health challenges that create extreme combativeness with others.

My own mother is like this. She cant stop herself. She has lost family and friends from the things she has done. It's like the jealousy becomes overwhelming and the sabotage calms her down and releases it. Please be careful. It starts with destruction of property, but she can spread lies, file false police reports, sabotage events, your job, to about everything you can think of that is outside your home. Please get a camera for recording outside your home. Her rage and spite to get back at you is very strong right now.", "I'd want to know why your parents won't allow her to stay with them, or pay for a place for her to stay at.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that she's an addict or alcoholic, she's been coddled her entire life and never had to face repercussions of the things she's done. There's no way that this is her first time breaking into a car or destroying someone's personal items. I'm sure she's stolen her fair share of items and/or money. \n\nIt's best you go very low contact or NC with her, and possibly with your parents as well.

At some point she will need to grow up and be an adult sooner is better then later", "Yup, this!!!", "That's what makes the parents the AH here as well, shaming op for not letting sister stay and yet there they are, not letting the sister stay with them, like don't shame someone for something you yourselves won't do", "No but it wasn't that long I can rewrite it"]}
