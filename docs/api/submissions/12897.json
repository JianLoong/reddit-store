They are her parents. Definitely NTA.", "She is not a respectful guest or a polite human being.  How dare she destroy anything in your house?  Your parents can house her or pay for their housing.  She disrespected her sibling who was doing her a favor, and this is how she repays a favor?  Keep her away. kt", "NTA. \u201cYes, paper is that important. Thanks for your concern.\u201d", "NTA\nYour parents won\u2019t even take her in?\nYikes. She\u2019s obviously toxic.", "\"made her mad that I wasted my time like this\"\nBaby girl you are on the STREETS. You need to be mad about other things boo. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc\n\nIn case it wasn't clear: Not the asshole.", "NTA. You are wrong about one thing though. You aren't her only hope. She is her only hope. She makes her own choices and they have consequences. You don't owe her a place to live, she earns one by being helpful and kind and thankful. She chose to be a wretched brat instead.", "NTA. Your sister is toxic.", "NTA, your sister needs to learn to not bite the hand that feeds her.", "Lmao", "A friend of mine was kicked out at 14 and had to work the streets until she was old enough get a \"real\" job", "If it's really important to you there are ways. Many drug companies with give you the medication for free and there are many mental health options available  like your county mental health. If you are mentally ill you are usually entitled  to file for social security  which comes with medicaid/MediCal. People who want to get healthy can. Does it require effort? Yes. But it can be done. And before you say but, they are mentally ill they can't navigate  thru the process .. well, there are advocates.", "Which you have to be able to navigate for an advocate. You can't just show up and demand help. That's how you get arrested. \n\nAnd not all mental illnesses qualify for ssi. Not even most physical disabilities qualify you for ssi. \n\nBefore the aca I couldn't get medication covered by my county medical because I had never participated in an inpatient care program.  Until I wound up in the hospital for self harm I couldn't even get counseling appointments more then 1x monthly. Counties have different requirements.  \n\nEven now with aca medical unless I'm in the actual middle of a major depression episode where I admit to hurting myself I can't get appointments more then bimonthly. Though that has more to due with the nationwide shortage of mental health care professionals.\n\nI think the difference between being ill and unable to stop yourself from making a mistake vs being an asshole isn't always your actions so much as what you do after. Such as when I had post pardum, I know at times I cried, I raged but I ALWAYS apologized. Then did what I could to make it right.", "There is a huge difference between mental illness and just being an asshole. I agree with that. I also know first hand if you are having a mental health crisis you CAN show up at say your CMH agency and ask for an advocate  or an appointment without getting arrested. It's all about how you do it of course. If you show up and say threaten to blow the joint up then yes, you are going to get your mental health help in the county jail.", "NTA but if your parents were so concerned why didn't they let her stay?", "NTA. Tell her to find someone to let her live there after she disrespects them.  Even your parents won\u2019t give her housing and YOU are the monster? Na you\u2019re good.  You were kind and hospitable, not your fault she\u2019s ungrateful and an AH", "Wait, why are YOUR parents telling you that you are THEIR child's only hope??? They won't let her stay with them, why are you supposed to?", "NTA:\n\nFirst off, I would tell your sister \"that SCIFI building project means more to me then you ever will\" if you wanted to be petty, and second, if she really wanted a roof over her head, the local jail is always an option but you tried to be a good brother and gave her a place to stay, but she apparently forgets that!", "NTA so your parents won't take her in, but they expect you to just ignore her actions and take her in.", "Obviously NTA as she\u2019s already disrespecting your personal space and sounds like there\u2019s a bad history, so makes sense that you wouldn\u2019t want to take any chances by giving her a second chance (or who know how many chances at this point). If you ever decide to let her around again in the future, should probably make a rule that she can\u2019t be in the house alone, until she can be trusted. Hopefully she changes and she can reconcile with you and your parents, and never goes back to who she is now. But whatever happens, just a suggestion for if you choose to allow her around your home again. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, having to kick a family member out is never easy, and it sucks that she\u2019s putting you through this. \n\nI am curious why she would care about your writing project though? Not that it changes anything. Is there any rhyme or reason for it? Or does she just get irrationally angry? Not that it\u2019s any of my business, just seems like such an odd thing for her to even care about, much less try to destroy? But I guess there\u2019s not always answer either.", "NTA. Sister is an ungrateful psycho.", "NTA. Her own parents don't want her staying that's a huge red flag for me. Best of luck with it.", "NTA- don\u2019t her back into your place.", "Doest matter if she doesn't get your hobby it was yours and she had no right to destroy it, if your parents are that concerned then it's there job to let her stay at there place", "If she asks again he should tell her \"sorry I'm too busy writing my dumb little story\".", "I feel like we don't need this kind of anti-homeless statement to become commonly accepted especially when we already live in a society that would rather homeless people all just die than \"take up space\".", "The actual truth is the word \"some\" doesn't at all mean \"majority\".", "And accepting that sorry may not fix the damage you did because of your illness. That\u2019s an important one.", "I have. Some are great. But you\u2019d be amazed at how many get mad at you if you try to help.\n\nAlso how many of the men ONLY or primarily as women. Especially young women. And get up real close and personal while doing it too.", "Not to mention the possibly HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH for ONE prescription. How the fuck is someone whose brain is betraying them and who is unable to afford a roof over their heads or even food supposed to find that kind of money, even if they do find a decent doctor who doesn't think they're drug seeking or faking and actually diagnoses them correctly and is willing to put them on medication? \n\nPeople are completely blind to how entirely fucked getting medication you NEED is. I've said repeatedly that drug laws literally make it harder to get medication legally than to illegally self-medicate. (DEA, I'm looking at you and I hate you.) I've had *constant* problems getting medication, and I come from a place of incredible privilege regarding availability of treatment, insurance, etc."]}
