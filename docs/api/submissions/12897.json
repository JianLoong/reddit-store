If her attitude and behavior are that bad, why would they expect you to overlook them and let her stay with you.", "She tore up a novel you are writing ?", "Is there a chance that people call you Jo? \n\nNTA.", "NTA and your sister having nowhere to go sounds like a your sisters problem.", "NTA where exactly did she reside before this??", "NTA. Your parents could\u2019ve taken her in. You\u2019re not the only hope. There\u2019s also shelters.", "NTA\n\nIf you need a place to stay, don't mock and destroy your host's hobby.  She screwed herself.", "NTA why won\u2019t her own parent let her stay again? Why doesn\u2019t she have a job and a place of her own?", "NTA  Your sister willfully destroyed something that you have had for 13 years, what would be next? You needed to protect what was yours.", "NTA. Let your sister find her way in life. She is totally disrespectful of you. You have a car, a house, a job and you are wasting YOUR time? Good for you having a hobby. I  hope it turns into a big hit someday. Your parents turned your sister away for a reason. I don't know what it is, but don't get into this mess. You are not Obi Wan Kenobi. You are not your sister's only hope. Tell your parents you tried, sister blew it with her disrespect.", "If *you* know she has nowhere to go - then that most definitely means she is also aware of her own situation, but she still chose to disrespect you, destroy your property and pass judgment on how you spend your time?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nEvery single day I\u2019m shocked at the unhinged behavior people display on this sub. WHO on planet earth would consider doing such a thing. Baffling.", "I hope ripping up that paper was really worth homelessness to her.  NTA", "NTA. If it's 'only paper,' then why did your AH sister tear it up? She doesn't like that you have talent & are working on a project that means something to you, cuz she doesn't have that. That's very strange & I wouldn't want her anywhere near my stuff, cuz I couldn't trust her.", "NTA, in what world would that be acceptable behavior??? Her only hope isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s to get her act together so her entire family doesn\u2019t consider her toxic. You did her a favor and in return she destroys your stuff and calls your hobby stupid? Absolutely buck wild. What was she expecting to happen?", "She needs big girl panties. She\u2019s old enough to know better. You have to learn gratitude and boundaries. She acts spoiled. Don\u2019t cling on to a person, even if they are your sister, that is determined to sink.", "NTA lol so your parents are trying to shame you for the vary thing that they just did.", "She made the proverbial mistake of looking a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nShe BROKE into your car. By virtue of blood, was graciously GIVEN space in your home to stay. Was provided food and other amenities.\n\nAnd turns around to trash something important to you.\n\nAlmost makes it seem like there's a reason y'all's parents didn't let her stay with them...\n\nNTA. Your sister is a selfish toxin, and she disrespected you IN YOUR HOME. Let her hit rock bottom and then ask her if she's still wasting her time whatever she's doing to put herself there.", "NTA your parents suck too", "NTA, and you're not her only hope.  Your parents don't want to deal with her so neither should you.", "Your parents gave her 30 dollars and put her out to be homeless again. That says everything without saying much. You better do the same. She sound controlling and toxic. Don't let her stay with you. She made her bed by disrespecting you and your home now let her lay in it. or her lack of bed", "NTA whatever your parents won't let her in but expect you to? FO with that bs", "No good deed goes unpunished. NTA", "For no reason, I'm very paranoid and I think I need to go back up all my fics to somewhere. They're all digitized, haven't been on paper for years, but I'm still feeling maximum anxiety all of a sudden", "wait let me get this straight, your parents gave her 30 bucks and sent her off but they're calling YOU an AH for not taking her in after she destroyed your property just because? There's definitely more to this story, NTA though obviously.", "NTA and send her back to your parents", "NTA. You took her in & she destroyed a manuscript that you'd been working on for years. Then has the nerve to play the victim. Nope. After that stunt, she needs to find her own solution. Edit to say: Lock your car from now on.", "It seems like something else is happening with your sister here, mental health wise. Is this kind of behavior suddenly happening or has she always been like that?", "What immense hypocrisy.\n\nWas the paper really that important? I would respond you'll pitch in another $30 if it makes them all leave you alone.\n\nNTA", "NTA she\u2019s a hateful person.", "INFO: Why your parents don't want her in their house?", "NTA - it may have been just paper to her and your parents but it\u2019s the words on that paper that make it so valuable to you.  \n\nYou would never be able to put the same exact words on paper in the same arrangement.\n\nThat is years worth of effort that was destroyed by your sister.\n\nYour not the only hope for her, your parents are not willing to take her in and she is their responsibility if anyone\u2019s.\n\nYou can\u2019t let her back into your home as she has shown that she has no respect for you or your belongings. She needs to show real remorse for what she has done.", "NTA. If it was \"just paper\", why did she rip it up? It was deliberate.\n\nTell them you will only allow her back if she painstakingly tapes together everything she ripped up and rewrites it word for word PRIOR to re-entering your home. That should shut everyone up because all you would be asking is for her to replace what she destroyed.\n\nBut seriously, don't get more involved with her. She is somehow unstable. Call the police next time. ETA: if your PARENTS won't let her stay, that's a sign. It's not she doesn't have anywhere else to go, she's just burned all those bridges apparently. Don't let her burn you.", "NTA.", "NTA! If parents won't take her, that says alot. Sister violated your space and your property. Don't let that continue. Does she have hard lessons to learn? Yes, but that's on her at 25yo.", "Its about the paper, but its not about the paper. The paper is a sign that things were going to go very very badly for OP if he let her stay", "My parents wouldn't let me stay with them either, but they're also abusive so your point is not valid on that one.", "And she told him to grow up. She, the homeless girl, who went back to her parents for help.\n\nLMFAO\n\nNTA", "Why do you need this info to make a judgment? There's *always* more to the story.", "Just because there may be more to the story doesn't mean we can't make an AH or NTA call.  Whatever the reason for her doing it or why she isn't at her parents, she violated her brothers trust in a very personal way after he let her stay with him after breaking into his car without his knowledge.  \n\nOP is NTA and should cut his sister out of his life.  Never keep people in your life that will try to destroy things that give you joy.", "Why would OP do anything for her at this point?", "Right because she can totally be trusted after what she just did.", "And then, there are those who have no family left (a high percentage of orphans go directly from foster care to the street), those whose family is so toxic they're better off without, those whose mental health issues have exhausted all those who tried to care for them, or all of the above.", "A lot are, but there\u2019s certainly also a portion that are too ashamed or stubborn to seek or accept any help.", "The actual truth is that is a majority of homeless people(at least in America) have either a mental illness or substance abuse problem. It\u2019s not as \u201cblack and white\u201d to say they\u2019re assholes who simply burned bridges.", "There's also a lot who were thrown out by bigots, or treated horribly until they had to leave even though they had nowhere to go", "THIS.\n\nHow many times I've messed up and wound up without my own place... but I learned VERY young to respect people who help you, so I've always managed to find a warm spot to rest my head...", "But in context, considering she destroyed OPs property, that likely isn't the case here.", "She's not even their responsibility. She's a grown ass adult.  Which makes it all the more ridiculous that they want her to be OP's problem.", "But they helped her. They gave her tHiRtY dOlLaRs.", "Except they didn't shame the OP for not letting the sister stay? OP's understandably doing that to himself.", "Curiosity.", "Ok but it's still a bad point to make because there's a fuck ton of horrible parents out there..\n\nImagine being me.. 5 years old. You and your dad are living at your grandparents and neither are home. You brought your rc cars to school even though you weren't supposed to.\n\nDad says drink sunlight dish soap or be kicked out. That was the option.", "And OP gave her a place to stay for several days, that's worth a lot more than $30. Her parents should cough a bit more, imo. \n\nNTA, this would have ended very badly if the sister had been allowed to stay.", "\"they didn't let her stay, but they gave her thirty dollars and texted me asking if the paper was really that important. She has nowhere else to go, and I'm her only hope\"\n\nThat is pretty much them trying to shame op into letting her stay after destroying ops papers that are important to op.", "What kind of grown ass adult shreds up paper on accident while knowing EXACTLY what the paper contains and how important it is? Why do you think the sister froze when OP asked her what the paper shreds were from? Because sister knew OP was gonna get upset but did it anyway!!", "I just don\u2019t get why she only did one piece and not the whole thing", "Depending on her psychiatric profile, it could be a test to see what she can get away with, or to see if OP loves her more than the project. Or it could be that she didn't like that portion. Or maybe she has voices in her head. \n\nSometimes we don't get to understand someone's reasons for doing things they know they shouldn't."]}
