{"id": 8304, "submission_id": "10l7nbg", "title": "AITA for snapping at my ex-coworker about makeup?", "selftext": "Brief background: I (40sF) am married to my husband (40sM). We have three great kids. I have a job I love. We are secure, happy and healthy. \n\nI'm a very low-maintenance person when it comes to my appearance. I take care of myself, but I won't spend time, effort, and money on complicated beauty routines. I don't wear makeup or get my hair or nails done. I live in my work uniform or jeans and comfy tops. I love to see women empowered in their femininity standing in their own beauty, and I have no problem with those who enjoy makeup, etc., but those looks are not for me. I am well-loved and perfectly happy with my plain, comfortable self.\n\nCurrent situation: My former coworker (20sF) is a very feminine woman. Never without makeup, a new manicure every few weeks, etc. She always looks beautiful. She still comes to work once in a while to visit another coworker she's friends with, and we'll chat for a minute if I'm not busy. She's usually very sweet, but the last time she came in was different. \n\nWe said our hellos, and she immediately popped off with this: \"You know, OP, you'd look so gorgeous if you wore makeup and dyed your hair. Let's go to Sephora this weekend, I'll help you pick your best colors and we'll give you a makeover. You'll love it!\"\n\nNow, this woman knows very well that I don't wear makeup, as it's come up before when I complimented her on a pretty purple mascara she was wearing, and she offered to let me try it. I politely refused and told her why, she said okay, no big deal. This time, I politely refused again, but she insisted that it would be good for me, then started pointing out flaws in my face and the gray in my hair. She wouldn't let up, even when I kept telling her no, it's really not my thing, thanks anyway. When she finally said, \"But I can help you fix all the problems with your face,\" I lost my temper. \n\nI snapped at her, \"Why the hell are you being so pushy? My face and hair are NOT 'problems.' I'm fine with the way I look, and I don't fucking like makeup. It's an expensive pain in the ass. I don't want a makeover, now please, just drop it.\"\n\nShe turned red, muttered \"Fine, whatever,\" and walked away. Apparently she went straight to her coworker friend and complained about me, because that coworker told me later that I should have been nicer about turning her down, and she was trying to help me. I do feel bad about snapping at her, but I only lost it after she refused to take no for an answer several times.
