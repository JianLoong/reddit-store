I had a simple cold when I was pregnant and I felt like total crap because the immune system is a bit weaker at the time to prevent issues with it attacking the baby. Also your wife needs rest and relaxation right now, not 3 kids running around. Hellen can lock her bedroom door, or keep a blanket nearby to cover things. She\u2019ll manage this once. \n\nBravo for standing up for your wife and baby. I hope her labor and delivery are easy, and her and baby are happy and healthy!", "Not only are you NTA, but you need to add in your conversation to her to keep that same energy and never ask you for anything again. Those are kids, where is their Daddy? That's the only person in the world that has a reasonable expectation of being responsible for their children with her. Anyone else is doing her favor. If he/they are a dud, that's still on her because she's the one that picked the father. Stop pampering people for their bad choices. I'm not saying beat her down about it I'm saying don't let her use her choices to beat you down. Match energy", "NTA in any way! If a parent has sick children, they are responsible for caring for those children. If she asked and you had said yes she should have been kissing your feet, but it sounds like she has an expectation that you and your wife are at her beck and call. As a single parent I understand how challenging this can be to deal with alone, but that\u2019s my job as a parent. Regardless of the fact that your wife of pregnant. No person is obligated to watch someone that is ill if it makes them uncomfortable. As your wife is pregnant, there is even more reason to be cautious, especially when she has struggled before. You and your wife need to put your family\u2019s needs first. \n\nThis will probably continue as you set boundaries with your growing family and your sister. She may expect that if you or your wife are doing something with your child that there is no reason you can\u2019t include her kids. Don\u2019t let her make you feel guilty for putting your family first and continue to set healthy boundaries. In the end it will be best for your growing family and hopefully things will find a better balance for you all!", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s her job to find a way to wrap presents without needing a sitter, especially when your children are sick and you wife is due to have a baby anyway. Helen is being absolutely ridiculous and acting like a child over like it\u2019s a life or death situation.", "This was such an easy no. Just say no, that\u2019s it, Cami needs this time to be about her health, the baby\u2019s well being, and zero about anyone else. It\u2019s not even a life or death situation, it\u2019s for present wrapping time? No, NO.\n\nAnd going forward until the pregnancy goes through safely, just state now in advance that it will be a HARD NO from now until baby is born until you\u2019re both ready. SIL has to make a plan.", "NTA.

I mean, they're my kids, my responsibility. Of course, I'd have been grateful for the help. And gratitude is something Helen seems to lack, too.\n\nThe main thing is that your wife's health and the baby's health are primary. BEing in labor while you're sick is really hard at best, dangerous to you and the baby at worst (like the baby could be born with the virus, and who knows how bad it would be for a newborn).

Sit with your wife and explain just how cruel what her sister did. You two need to be on the same page that your wife isn't going to help her like this any longer.

Tired of irresponsible single moms getting a pass on this sub she's a bad mom. No matter what it is irresponsible to have three kids when single and not financially stable enough to hire a sitter and pay bills. What happens when OP can't help with bills? It's the kid who suffers in the end. The single mom should have had to face reality with the first kid. People are too kind and help out as children are innocent - which is very valid. But this prevents single moms from changing anything about their situation and bringing additional poor souls into their irresponsible lives. (Preface: In no way do I think anybody but the mother and a doctor, for purely health consultation, should have a say in abortions) You can't be anti-abortion for moral, religious or other reasons, make irresponsible life decisions leading to not exactly ideal financial situations, and choose to have unsafe sex (Sure accidents happen but they are rare let's not talk about exceptions those exceptions are what planned parenthood resources should be for).  It's like wanting to have your cake, eat it and make cake pops out of it.", "NTA.
