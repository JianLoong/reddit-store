My parents, I & my GF dogs were great, lots of walks, behavioural training like, sit, stay, lie down etc. My Brothers dog on the other hand (an alsatian) was not trained well in the slightest, he would bark all day & night at litteraly anything, someone made a noise in the house, bark! someone walked past the house, Bark! you get the picture.\n\nSo 3 years ago my brother & SIL had a baby in the house, we were all super respectful & we even had the luck of being able to take our dog to work so there wouldnt be any unnessacary noise to wake their baby, shortly after (about 6 months) my brother & SIL moved out into thier own house. Amazing right, more space & no more dog barking constantly... right? Well, wrong, thier dog was so noisy that their neighbours complained constantly. So being the kind family we are, we let them drop the dog off here during the day when they went to work & picked him up again when they finished. This was \"fine\" for a while. I say fine but we just endured the noise. recently there was always an excuse why they had to drop the dog off again, \"oh we have a party to go to\", \"we're going swimming\" litterally any excuse. Again we just endured it because surely it wouldnt be forever.\n\nNow to present day, Me & my GF had our first child (5 month old), it has been so difficult with that dog barking constantly, even just trying to set a rutine with my son for his noon nap is impossible. So i asked my Mum to talk to my Bro & SIL & explain why the dog can't stay. So my Mum had a chat with them & there response was, \"well can it not wait until I give birth\" ( 8 weeks). My mother was in tears after this (she can't stand the dog either), so i took it upon myself to message them, stating that it's disturbing my son & i have to put him first & that thier dog shouldn't be our burdon. They had pretty much replied with the same as before \"honestly can it not wait 8 weeks\" and have now removed all of us of social media & told my parents they wont have to see them ever again (meaning my parents cant see thier grandchildren). Both my Mum & Dad have tried to reach out to no response.\n\nHeres where i think i might be the A, My SIL has said she's having a really stressful pregnancy & can't have the dog barking, stressing her out. Well, so did my GF, but they didn't seem to care when she was Pregnant. So i Called the Council and Put in a noise Complaint, My Mum then forced the dog back to them, after recieving a letter from the council.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA For Forcing my parents hand and Causing potential stress on the baby?", "created_utc": 1685152615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sv0o5/aita_m_28_for_telling_my_brother_m_32_and_his/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know about where you live, but we have doggy daycares in my area. You can drop your dog off to play during the day. Yes, there is a cost, but it might help them. This may not be just being untrained. Their dog may be having anxiety or other issues. \n\nYour brother should rehome the dog to a better suited environment or have a trainer come in to work with the dog. Yes, you are all suffering, but so is the poor dog. I hope your brother can focus on the dog's needs over his own.", "NTA\n\nThis is all about them.  It's fine for them to inconvenience you, but you cannot do exactly the same thing back to them.\n\nSeeing as the dog seemed to be living with you, is telling your brother and SIL that they either take their dog or you will rehome it to an owner that actually spends time with it and trains it.", "NTA. You have your own child to look out for. And this is their problem to deal with - their solution should not be to dump it on someone else. I would bet that after the \u201cuntil it give birth\u201d was up, they would come up with another excuse to dump the dog on you again. Honestly, they should have gotten the dog properly trained when they first got it.", "NTA, your baby should come first. If you wait any longer, she will come up with more reasons not to take care of her dog. Maybe she should hire a dog trainer.", "NTA, German Shepard's have quite a loud bark, I can imagine how annoying that could be. Why do they even have a dog if they constantly pawn it off on other people?", "I'd be willing to bet that they won't stick with the \"you can't see the baby\" thing very long because they are going to need your parents to help out now when they have 2.

That's on them for being shitty pet owners.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother and SIL should rehome their dog if they can\u2019t be bothered to take care of it.

It is petty of them to use their kids to try to manipulate your parents.", "NTA\n\nFor one thing brother and SIL could not have chosen a worse breed of dog for their living situation. There's a reason these dogs are mainly used for police/defence force type jobs. They are incredibly intelligent and do get bored very easily. But that's not to say that the ordinary Joe Blow can never own one. They need proper training and stimulation and guidance. Something that bro and SIL were never prepared to do.\n\nI feel really sad for this beautiful creature. Rest assured that what you did was right.", "NTA.

They needed to send the dog to re-education camp long ago.", "NTA they sound like bad dog owners, but it is their responsibility, not yours.  Why didn\u2019t they ever do dog training??  \nI\u2019m not usually one to suggest this, but maybe it\u2019s time to find that poor dog a more appropriate home.", "NTA they need to train their dog", "ESH. You\u2019re a bit of an AH for calling the council & using public resources to resolve a family issue.  If your parents own the building, it was up to them to either ban the dog or tell you that they were going to put up with it indefinitely & you would need to do the same until you leave.  Your parents for not telling your brother to take care of his own dog and/or telling you to just deal with the dog being on the property. Your bro & sil are the biggest AHs for not taking care of their dog & basically treating it as an accessory or occasional play thing rather than a living creature & their responsibility", "Right? At that point, maybe consider rehoming the dog? He deserves to be with people who actually want him around and are willing to put the work in to train him.", "Public resources are available for all, family or no family. Family members take each other to court all the time.

Thanks to the ones like you who love to nitpick about people who use public resource, abused people are affaid to use it to help themselves.
