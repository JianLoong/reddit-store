We're all extremely close, and I consider them my best friends. \n\nRecently, Jen (26F) from our friend group got married and we all attended her wedding. I, along with Megan (another member of our friend group) gave a short dance performance at the wedding. Jen also joined us towards the end. This was all planned beforehand, and we made sure to run it through with Jen. In fact, she really wanted us to do it. \n\nWe're not professional dancers or anything, but I do like dancing and made sure it was perfect. After our dance, several people came up and complimented us. Jen was so happy too, and I thought everything went about smoothly. \n\nHowever, the next day, I received a text from Jen's husband Rick and her sister-in-law saying that we went over the top and tried to out-do the bride. Rick also said that Jen would never be honest with us because we're her friends, but I should know that I'm \"a horrible person and just wanted attention.\" His sister also went off about how we were trying to \"impress the men at the wedding.\" \n\nWe only wanted the best for Jen, and it was never our intention to hurt anybody. I can't reach Jen right now, but both Megan and I are overthinking the shit out of this.

End of story. While there's a legitimate argument to be made regarding emotional intelligence and the prospect of somebody perhaps not putting meaning behind their words, in an ideal friendship, you *are* able to take things at face value. If you can't trust Jen to mean what she says, you simply have no basis for any sort of relationship. Conversely, if you *do* have a strong friendship, then you *can* take Jen at her word, and therefore the dance is fine.\n\nRick and his sister are virtue signaling. I hope Jen knew what she was getting into.", "NTA If Jen liked it and approved it, that was all that mattered. The SIL and hubby need to remove the poorly placed stick. \n\nUnless the rest of the wedding was insanely boring, you stole nothing from the bride. To me, it showed that you cared enough to create something special for her. \n\nI would definitely speak to Jen (probably without mentioning who complained, that wouldn't end well for anyone) but just to make sure she knows the dance was just for her and no one else. \n\nAnd maybe recommend a good proctologist for the hubby and his family.", "NTA\n\nJen joined you. You confirmed with her prior to the wedding. And dancing at weddings is so common. I know people who go to weddings solely for eating and dancing. \n\nJen is a big girl, if she had a problem, she could speak for herself, and she did. She told you it was fine. \n\n>impress the men at the wedding.\"\n\nYes, because that is what we go to weddings for. So that men can look at me trying my level best not to fall in heels. /s", "NTA\n10 year friendships are past the \u201cShe\u2019s too nice to tell you\u201d stage. I call bullshit on their part.", "so you were invited to perform at a wedding and were called an asshole because you performed too well? what\u2019s next? Are we going to start blaming florists if the flower arrangements are too beautiful? What if the string quartet plays too well? What if the cake is too elaborate? Is literally everything at the wedding supposed to be bland and boring just so that the bride and groom can be the only thing interesting to look at? why are people trying to make receptions as boring as possible? This shit is getting out of control. \n\noffering to provide free entertainment for the reception makes you a good friend, NTA.", "NTA\n\nHard to tell how Jen feels but Rick and Sister's comments *reek* of jealousy. I do think you've overthinking this: Unless you hear it from Jen I think it's safe to dismiss Rick's hot take here.\n\nOr you can reach out to Jen and let her know Rick is sending some nasty messages your way. Either way you and your friends did nothing wrong.", "NTA! \nJen was in the planning process right? Tell her about the text you got when you get a chance to reach her. Ask how she felt about it, and if she knew the husband and SIL reaching out to you.", "NTA; Jen was IN the dance and it sounds like you did at least one rehearsal if you made sure it was perfect. The fact is that if at any time Jen was uncomfortable or didn\u2019t like the idea she would and could have completely axed it. I\u2019m thinking the negativity you\u2019re getting from the sister in law is jealousy either that she wasn\u2019t invited to be included or just of the attention that you got. NTA", "NTA. Her husband is though wonder what Jen will think about him calling her friends horrible people.", "NTA- if your intention was to celebrate the bride- than you aren\u2019t TA. This is not an uncommon thing and Jen seemed to enjoy it. You should ask Jen for coffee if you can and show her the texts, tell her you are very concerned that she might feel this way. \n\nIf your actions unknowingly put her out- just apologize from the heart and ask what she needs from you to make it right. But don\u2019t buy into the groom\u2019s sisters bs. Just block her.", "NTA. If Jen had a problem with it, she probably would have told you, considering she was a part of the performance itself.", "NTA- if Jen agreed it was okay for you to do it then you did nothing wrong! It sounds like Rick and sister have some sort of issue with attention not being only on the bride (and/or groom) 100% of the time and are throwing a fit about it", "NTA what a truly strange thing to make a fuss about. Some people are so petty smh. She seems like she had no issue with it and if she can\u2019t be honest with her best friends that\u2019s a whole different problem.", "INFO: is Jen always a pushover/people pleaser?\n\nIt\u2019s weird that she gave the ok, but both her husband/the groom & SIL are telling you it was terrible, attention-seeking & an attempt to outshine the bride? \n\nThis means somewhere Jen either didn\u2019t understand you or felt pressure from someone - you to do this dance or groom/SIL that it was inappropriate - so it\u2019s likely she is people-pleasing. \n\nSounds like NTA, but also sounds like Jen has other issues. (It is random to do a dance at a wedding, though, w/o more info - like, was this in lieu of a toast or a cultural thing).", "I'd tell Jen what Rick said (doubt she knows) and watch their first married fight. Rick's T A and his sister. You're NTA.", "NTA, I think the SIL is the one who is butthurt that she wasn't included in the performance and is using her brother to make y'all feel bad. Talk to Jen about it after the honeymoon and see what she really thinks.", "Ew. The hubby and his sister either have some weird ideas about you or Jen isn't being honest with you. I can't imagine allowing my friends to do a dance at my wedding if I truly didn't want them to. She okayed it ahead of time and joined in. If she wasn't good with it, it was HER place to say it and she shouldn't hide behind her brother and SIL (if that's what's happening).\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nPut it out of your mind until Jen gets back from honeymooning then ask her about it after. If she really felt uncomfortable and it wasn't just her husband and SIL playing off misogynist ideology then you can address it when you have Jen's attention. Until then, don't bother acknowledging husband and SIL because that gives them a chance to sell a story to Jen.\n\nNOTE: If the husband and SIL are doing this behind Jen's back, this is a problem for her to confront. It will look like you don't trust her to make decisions (the same way her husband does) if you go around her and try to deal with this on your own.", "NTA\n\nThe best thing you can do is send the texts to Jen and let her know that you and Megan no longer feel comfortable around her husband or SIL anymore and won't be having anything to do with them for the foreseeable future\n\nThat you apologize if the dance made her uncomfortable in any way and that both of you sincerely apologize\n\nMy guess though, is that her husband's sister is the one who had the problem and ran her mouth to her brother about it", "NTA. The only thing I can think of is that the groom got in trouble for enjoying the performance too much and tried to blame it on you- otherwise I can\u2019t figure out why he\u2019d care.", "NTA", "Three options I see. One husband isn't lying, your friend didn't like it. Two husband is full of shit and only represents his sister's opinion. Three, he didn't like it and it's his wedding too and lumped her in with him for effect?\n\nMy gut is, you cleared it with Jen nobody told him and his sister riled up all his slighted feelings. \n\nI'm inclined to say NTA, you cleared it with the bride. Hope you can hear it directly from your friend", "If you cleared it with her first you\u2019re NTA, even if she didn\u2019t like it but didn\u2019t tell you. Her husband could have stopped it if she was too afraid to speak up. They sound like jerks.", "INFO: Did Jen see what you actually planned to do in advance, or did you give her a 'general idea' about what kind of dancing you had in mind?", "NTA. If you ran it by her she had the ability to say no. And your intentions were good.\n\nPlus everyone loves those dances. They're fun.", "NTA", "NTA. No one can outdo a bride on her wedding day. The entire day is about her and the groom. If Rick and the sister feel this way, that\u2019s something they should have kept to themselves. He\u2019s basically telling you and your friend he thought you were more attractive than his wife on their wedding day? That\u2019s weird as hell and so disrespectful to the bride. You\u2019re not responsible for his feelings. Honestly, I would let him know he made you uncomfortable with his comments and not to contact you again about this.", "Nta, and tell your friend!! He husband may be trying to alienate you. \nIf it's true, you have the opportunity to discuss with your friend. If it's false, she needs to know her new hubs is a weasel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds super cringe and I can see why Rick wasn\u2019t a fan.", "The SIL is mad her husband was looking at you, threw a fit at her brother and they both went after you. It sounds like you weren't the only people doing a dance. NTA.", "NTA - Message to Jen, Hubby & SIL at the same time with the accusatory message included.", "NTA. Jen told you it was fine beforehand. You aren\u2019t a mind-reader. How were you supposed to know that when she said she wanted you to do it, she meant she didn\u2019t want you to do it at all?  That\u2019s ridiculous.", "I should mention that her SIL's husband complimented us too and I feel like her comments might stem from that. I just remember saying thank you and going on my way. I didn't realise this would be a huge issue", "I wouldn't call her a people pleaser, but Jen is shy and in the past, she has kept her feelings to herself. But I always thought that this was never an issue between us since I've literally known her since we were silly teenagers and tell each other everything.", "Yes, we sent her a video of our practice", "Of course, NTA\n\nI do have a question. Is your husband involved with your friend group. Does he feel like an outsider. Maybe he really wants you to distant yourself from your friend. It's just a thought.", "OP knowing that SIL\u2019s husband made a comment I would hold off on reaching out to Jen or reacting to her SO etc until you can talk in person (save the texts).", "NTA, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a problem here. Either, Rick has different boundaries than Jen or Jen isn\u2019t completely honest. That\u2019s the problem & it\u2019s not going away.", "Did she ask you to do the dance initially - as in whose idea was it? I am struggling to see how wanting to do a dance at a wedding would benefit Jen in any way other than if she wanted to have some more entertainment. But I am biased by the fact that I would hate it, whereas others including Jen may have wanted it.", "OK - the only way I could figure that you could be T A is if you accidentally misled Jen about the final performance. It sounds like you made every effort to ensure she had a chance to know what to expect. NTA", "So a couple of other people - the groom's friends and Jen's brother and cousins - were going to dance at the wedding too. I asked if we could too, and she agreed. It was meant to be a tribute thingy for her, and I asked her at least thrice if it was all good and if she wanted us to change it or not do it at all.", "Did they end up dancing at the wedding too?"]}
