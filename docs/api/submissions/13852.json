Within minutes of turning off my show he is passed out. I've raised this subject multiple times in the past and he always has the same answer as to why he's doing it: \"Your shows are fucking stupid and negative\". \n\nFor background: I am in my 5th year of Forensic Science. I have another year before I get my masters but I already have a full time job working hand in hand with law enforcement on some high profile cases. I know it sounds stupid but I cannot express how much I love my work. I have never been happier or more intrigued by any job I have ever had in the past. So, I have a tendency to watch things like Cold Case Files or Forensic Files and it's not just because I enjoy them but also because you can never learn too much in my field. These aren't the only shows I watch but a lot of them do have to do with my line of work. I can understand him hating these shows. I've found most guys absolutely hate them. BUT it's not just these shows. \n\nSo.. I tested it the other day because the night before he had pulled the same BS and changed my TV to something he wanted to watch instead and said he was tired of me watching this shit. So the next night I put on something that he likes: \"How it's made\". I wanted to see if he would change it and low and behold he fucking did. Mind you this is the show he ALWAYS switches the TV to whenever he changes my shows. I just looked at him and asked why the fuck he changed it this time (I was actually really watching this show and super involved so I was even more pissed) and he just shrugged and put on Hoarders. He never watches this show. So I went and shut off the internet, sat down on the couch and continued to watch the show on my phone. He came out asking what was wrong with the internet so I told him I shut it off and until he starts respecting me it will not be going back on. I pay the bill. He got pissed and said I'm being ridiculous because he should be able to watch whatever he wants to when he comes to bed after playing video games for hours because I don't need to hog the TV. If he asked to change it, it would be one thing. It's him being a disrespectful ass and just switching it when he sees I'm watching it that pisses me off and he knows that. AITA?\n\nETA: a commenter told me this might be important info to add here: my fianc\u00e9s father was a dirty cop (and had a bunch of dirty cop friends) and therefore it has completely stomped on his trust for police officers. He absolutely hates that I work hand in hand with law enforcement but likes that I work in forensic science.
