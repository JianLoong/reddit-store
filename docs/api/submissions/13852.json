I have another year before I get my masters but I already have a full time job working hand in hand with law enforcement on some high profile cases. I know it sounds stupid but I cannot express how much I love my work. I have never been happier or more intrigued by any job I have ever had in the past. So, I have a tendency to watch things like Cold Case Files or Forensic Files and it's not just because I enjoy them but also because you can never learn too much in my field. These aren't the only shows I watch but a lot of them do have to do with my line of work. I can understand him hating these shows. I've found most guys absolutely hate them. BUT it's not just these shows. \n\nSo.. I tested it the other day because the night before he had pulled the same BS and changed my TV to something he wanted to watch instead and said he was tired of me watching this shit. So the next night I put on something that he likes: \"How it's made\". I wanted to see if he would change it and low and behold he fucking did. Mind you this is the show he ALWAYS switches the TV to whenever he changes my shows. I just looked at him and asked why the fuck he changed it this time (I was actually really watching this show and super involved so I was even more pissed) and he just shrugged and put on Hoarders. He never watches this show. So I went and shut off the internet, sat down on the couch and continued to watch the show on my phone. He came out asking what was wrong with the internet so I told him I shut it off and until he starts respecting me it will not be going back on. I pay the bill. He got pissed and said I'm being ridiculous because he should be able to watch whatever he wants to when he comes to bed after playing video games for hours because I don't need to hog the TV. If he asked to change it, it would be one thing. It's him being a disrespectful ass and just switching it when he sees I'm watching it that pisses me off and he knows that. AITA?\n\nETA: a commenter told me this might be important info to add here: my fianc\u00e9s father was a dirty cop (and had a bunch of dirty cop friends) and therefore it has completely stomped on his trust for police officers.

When you are with him, do you feel loved, cherished, safe, respected, free to be yourself? Do you look forward to coming home to him/him coming home to you? If you think about him when you are apart, do you find yourself smiling? Do you ever look at him and just suddenly find yourself flooded with the knowledge that you love him? Do you think about the time you've spent with him and look forward to more years spent with him in the future?\n\nIf not, please do yourself a favor and break it off. Sooner, rather than later.", "The question is How do you want to live your life?", "Your boyfriend is a dick and that isn't due to his \"distrust\" of police officers.\n\nSeriously, think about if you want to live with this level of disrespect for the rest of your life.\n\nNTA.", "Maybe you need to read The Gift of Fear.\n\nTime to move someone out of the house.", "Get out now. You will regret marrying this man.", "I'd factor the hours of gaming into the cost-benefit analysis, OP.  NTA, but I see those red flags a-waving...", "Wait, how does he make so much less than you while you\u2019re in school? Either he\u2019s not working as much as he can or he\u2019s not contributing according to his income. When you get a real forensics job he will probably try to contribute 0%. Why would you want to get married to this dead weight?", "NTA. And you should definitely switch his gaming TV to something else while he is in the middle of playing.", "Considering he still did it when it was one of his favorite shows already on\u2026 it\u2019s definitely this. Op needs to run", "THIS should be the top comment!!!", "I've seen a lot of posts on 2X about women who thought that bad sex was their fault, they had a condition, maybe they were ace, etc until they actually got with a guy who treated them well and discovered that rheu actually have a healthy libido and like sex. There was a post like this this weekend if you want to search for it.", "Is it actually because of your conditions or would a caring and empathetic partner make it feel better for you than your current partner manages?\n\nI was with a guy similar to your partner in the past -  sex sucked and i thought it was my conditions at first,   and then after some thought i was like nope.  I'm a giver - he was a taker.\n\nTakers suck.", "If your only talking about penetration there is a lot of other ways to have enjoyable sex without penetration.", "OP is that what he said ?", "If you take fault for little things like that, he's gonna fault you for everything. He's the asshole. Not you.\n\nI've seen this so many times. My asshole father treats his wife like you are describing. I've told each one of them that he will never change and that I cut him off a long time ago. They eventually leave but not until after the damage is done.\n\nDon't put yourself in such a position. You seem like you're a very nice lady, I hate to see these things happen to nice people.\n\nIn the end, it's all about control and dominance.", "I bet he won't even try to find ways to help with that. Kick him out now I know it may not feel like it now but you will find someone who loves you for you xx", "Sometimes the stress in other parts of your life exacerbates pre-existing conditions like endo, and can create new stuff as well.", "Idk what your conditions are so I can\u2019t say this will apply to you but the sex with my ex was very painful for me and I thought it was definitely a me thing and was looking into it medically. Turns out it was just him. It\u2019s like my body was physically rejected his like my mind and emotions were mentally screaming at me to end the relationship. It\u2019s hard to have enjoyable sex with someone who just doesn\u2019t respect you or treat you the way you deserve to be treated.", "He\u2019s right about one thing, you being in forensic science IS wicked cool. It breaks my heart you said \u2018I know it sounds stupid\u2019 about work that you love and that is so interesting. He\u2019s ground you down more than you know with these tactics. You\u2019re NTA but you could be so much happier and more glorious without someone chipping away at you.", "A dirty cop in Massachusetts?!? I\u2019m SHOCKED, shocked I tell you. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re from MA because of your use of the word wicked.", "Takers may suck, but not well.", "Look up bite mark analysis which is just one among many other ridiculous and invalid methods of forensic science.", "It may be a side reason, but the main reason he turns off your show is to exert control over you, which you proved when he changed it from How It's Made. He has no respect for you as your own person.\n\nI highly recommend you read Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft. And also call off the engagement and move on.", "Yes, we also used to think the earth was flat and the sun revolved around earth. Science gets better. We also used to not have dna, much less with the sensitivity we have now. But fuck it all because the old science wasn\u2019t as good.", "I'm talking about methods that are literally in use today. Literally everything except DNA evidence is essentially pseudoscience with very little reliability.", "And the other side can present evidence as to its reliability and accuracy. The trier of fact decides if, taken into context with other evidence, including circumstantial evidence (which is even less accurate), and decide if, taken as a whole, the prosecution has presented evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. \n\nIf we were ONLY allowed to rely on DNA, finger prints, and video showing a full face, then any person with gloves, a face mask, and a hair net would be out committing the perfect crimes.", "You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. What do you think a jury will believe more, the fucking government using some very advanced seeming scientific techniques, or the defense\u2019s witness saying \u2018uh actually there is not yet conclusive evidence on the validity of these tests\u2019? It\u2019s obvious you know very little about the way the justice system actually acts in practice"]}
