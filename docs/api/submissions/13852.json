I have another year before I get my masters but I already have a full time job working hand in hand with law enforcement on some high profile cases. I know it sounds stupid but I cannot express how much I love my work. I have never been happier or more intrigued by any job I have ever had in the past. So, I have a tendency to watch things like Cold Case Files or Forensic Files and it's not just because I enjoy them but also because you can never learn too much in my field. These aren't the only shows I watch but a lot of them do have to do with my line of work. I can understand him hating these shows. I've found most guys absolutely hate them. BUT it's not just these shows. \n\nSo.. I tested it the other day because the night before he had pulled the same BS and changed my TV to something he wanted to watch instead and said he was tired of me watching this shit. So the next night I put on something that he likes: \"How it's made\". I wanted to see if he would change it and low and behold he fucking did. Mind you this is the show he ALWAYS switches the TV to whenever he changes my shows. I just looked at him and asked why the fuck he changed it this time (I was actually really watching this show and super involved so I was even more pissed) and he just shrugged and put on Hoarders. He never watches this show. So I went and shut off the internet, sat down on the couch and continued to watch the show on my phone. He came out asking what was wrong with the internet so I told him I shut it off and until he starts respecting me it will not be going back on. I pay the bill. He got pissed and said I'm being ridiculous because he should be able to watch whatever he wants to when he comes to bed after playing video games for hours because I don't need to hog the TV. If he asked to change it, it would be one thing. It's him being a disrespectful ass and just switching it when he sees I'm watching it that pisses me off and he knows that. AITA?\n\nETA: a commenter told me this might be important info to add here: my fianc\u00e9s father was a dirty cop (and had a bunch of dirty cop friends) and therefore it has completely stomped on his trust for police officers.

You're NTA but you need to have a serious think, and probably some individual and couples counseling before you marry this guy. And if he's not willing to engage in that then run!\nIf you have kids and he treated them with that much disrespect, and you knew you'd had prior warning about his behavior before even having those kids but still allowed it to happen, how would you feel?", "This is a wild one. It's simultaneously a mostly-inconsequential thing, but also a ***glaring*** red flag.\n\nLike... screaming red flag. I cannot express to you how fucked up that behavior is psychologically, even if the consequence is something you can ignore day-to-day.\n\nHe's deliberately squashing your enjoyment of an activity as soon as he enters a room with you ***regardless*** of what that activity is, and even does it if it's an activity he would otherwise enjoy. Psychologically, that's a bid for control. Not just a bid for control; he's ***seizing*** control just because he can, which is absolutely terrifying. It may not manifest in other ways, but if it does, many of them would be emotional/psychological (or physical) abuse markers.\n\nPlease please please try to take a couple steps back and analyze behavior of his like this and ask yourself how you'd react if it was a friend's fiance exhibiting those behaviors. Only you know your situation, so no one else can diagnose problems of that magnitude for you, but this is a behavior that screams \"control issues\" at a ludicrous volume.\n\nTake care of yourself and if you see a pattern after reading responses to this thread, don't wait to see if it gets better; take action immediately, even if it's just seeking couples therapy.\n\n(NTA, but the behavior you exhibited is petty in its own way. A healthy couple shouldn't be trading passive aggressive punishments to each other like this.)", "NTA. This is a power trip and petty.", "umm seems like the tv show's not the real point here.   \n\n\nfrom the sounds of it, your fiance does not respect you.   \n\n\nNTA for the sake of the subreddit but you probably have bigger problems.", "NTA. You know being with him is a choice, right? You are choosing this \u201cman\u201d?

Sounds like a lovely marriage to happen /s", "Well, it doesn\u2019t explain why he change the one channel that he always watches just because you were watching it.NTA if we had gone with the other forensic files before then, that would\u2019ve been more of an understandable thing that he hates cops. But then he did it with a show he normally likes to watch just because you were watching it. You are not the problem.", "NTA don\u2019t marry this man", "NTA. He hates your work. He disrespects you on a daily basis. He thinks what he wants to watch is more important than what you want. \n\nBut I have a question - why you are with him?  What are his redeeming features? Because love alone is not a solid foundation for successful marriage.", "First paragraph is enough. NTA. Horrible behaviour of his", "I don't care what his reasons for not liking the shows you watch might be. Unilaterally changing the channel without any discussion, and denigrating your taste as \"stupid\" is simply rude.

I usually don't say this but here's a few points that alarm me:\n\n1. OP is studying for masters and paying the bills. I think it's fair to say that anyone is free to use the time to relax after an undoubtfully long day.\n\n2. Dude plays hours of video games. He hates law enforcement due to his dad's history and he's taking that anger out on you.\n\n3. Why is OP still with the guy?\n\nRun, girl, run.", "I read the book that often gets linked here, \u2018Why Does He Do That?\u2019 and one of the random things is that the author says almost every abusive man, regardless of the style of abuse or anything else, always controls the tv remote. \n\nhttps://ia600108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "100% this.

Always out of sight of Mom, of course.\n\nWe were like eleven and thirteen at the time, though.", "I was ready to give OP a soft y t a. I also love these shows but my partner *asks* me not to watch them before bed as it can mess with his dreams.
