I think there's a bigger issue here than the cookie quality and amount. \n\n\n\nIf she wants you to forgo a tradition you guys have because she won't be present, she needs to say that.

I can see why she thinks you were trying to upstage her, but at least in your description, it sounds more like you got caught up in \"challenge accepted\" and it was a misunderstanding.

In OPs defense, I don't tell my husband he can't/wouldn't be able to do them, they're just my *thing* that I love doing. \n\nIf I had to miss out on those traditions and I came home to find out my husband had spent all that time optimizing and perfecting and improving on them, so that they were so clearly better than before, especially with all our friends and family there to see, it would straight up kill the whole thing for me. Like I don't want to optimize cookie baking and decorating, I want to have a nice festive time baking and decorating with my family and friends- but in this scenario it would feel *so* inferior and lackluster. \n\nIt would break my heart tbh. I guess I would land ESH (wife for being shitty about being the better baker, husband for going above and beyond to 'improve' on the tradition).\n\nLots of commenters talking about ADHD here too re: the husband which kinda sucks for me too, because baking can be really difficult for me due to my ADHD \ud83e\udd72", "He didn't do this out of the goodness of his little heart. I would actually love to hear the wife's side because I suspect there's some weaponized incompetence going on the other 364 days out of the year. If I was in this position, I'd have no problem leaving it to my husband because he's proved to me over and over again he's a good baker.", "I don\u2019t have a judgement but did they *need* more cookies? \n\nBecause for me it would partly depend on \u2018just because you can, does it mean you should?\u2019\n\nHe says he subbed out cheaper ingredients but spent 40% more. I cook and recipe test professionally and that is a huge difference. I mean if we go all \u2018he\u2019s an engineer!\u2019 is it appropriate for a project to go over budget by FORTY PERCENT?\n\nAnd again did they need that many cookies? Because if he spent a chunk of household income for cookies they didn\u2019t need does that now impact other gifts prepared, commit them to including more people next year after giving more this year and did the budget impact other things in the household pot or Christmas budget?\n\nIf that\u2019s all cool then they should discuss the emotions and see if they could add bits of each other\u2019s joy in it as right now it seems to needle each other more than bond. But if there was no need beyond him proving his work style then ooof. Making more food because you can is not good project management. \n\nAnd by the way I\u2019m not neurotypical. I run my kitchen like a mix of these two but wastage is a huge factor and budget. Anyone can do more by upping the budget by 40%!\n\nI wonder if the cookies are a tipping point for their interactions all year. Because if she is rude and demeaning all year and he constantly hyperfocuses into too much with no concern for budget, plans and what people want then they need counselling not cookies.", "See I think with that info if you don\u2019t have steady employment then honestly the going 40% over budget is way more of an issue here than the cookies.\n\nWho budgets what in the house? Who budgeted your groceries this month, Christmas expenses etc? Because an extra 40% for a lot of households in the current climate while one is a student with \u2018gig jobs\u2019 is \u2018so dude we have 500 cookies but we can\u2019t pay our bills.\u2019\n\nUnless you needed the extra, okayed the budget, spending 40% more money at a time like this is enraging and tone deaf unless you guys are super financially stable. The point of homemade gifts is often to save some money but gift time and love. \n\nYour wife is out of line the way she speaks to you. Absolutely appalling. But do you have a habit of blowing the budget when hyperfocusing? Because my brother does this with his ADHD and it was a reason we went no contact because not learning any coping strategies for it ended up piling pressure on me, his partners, friends etc to step in and sort out that he had run out of money and he also destroyed several GFs\u2019 credit.\n\nMy partner has ADHD and I get the spendy tendency but it can quickly become a crippling pressure for those living with them making up short fall or dealing with fall out. My GF is medicated, working on building better habits around ADHD and money and 7 years in, I am still not financially linked to her at all. We have a big financial disparity and her ADHD thinking about money would leave me bankrupt. \n\nJust because its common in ADHD doesn\u2019t make it cute anymore than poor time keeping. It is the thing that has tested our relationship more than anything else. Partly because not having money is scaring the fucking shit out of me while she\u2019s oblivious and partly because I feel like her mum checking her homework and it kills my libido because a parental dynamic is really bad for marriages.\n\nShe grew up rich as god. I grew up poor and am still poor. She originally just assumed money could be magicked up and would ask me to cover stuff she hadn\u2019t planned for or had overspent. I am on social security due to health and the mental labour it created was so bad for my mental health. I\u2019m not neurotypical and I\u2019m physically unwell and the fact this symptom of ADHD is sort of LOL\u2019d about when it is the biggest strain family, friends and partners note about living with someone with ADHD needs talked about. It can be so problematic it creates a financial abuse dynamic.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a habit of it and got carried away, that\u2019s different. But I don\u2019t think these comments about ADHD comprehend it is your condition to manage and no other gets as much of a pass for behaviours that can really damage relationships with others. You list all the stuff you do and I note \u2018ADHD management\u2019 isn\u2019t on there.\n\nI think your wife was an AH but I don\u2019t think this is about cookies but both your roles all year.\n\nEDIT: the other thing I didn\u2019t see mentioned is if you cleaned up? In my experience as a recipe tester we often set a test like this as part of an interview and if you cook more but don\u2019t clean up more as more creating equal more mess, we are concerned you can\u2019t stick to the brief, don\u2019t understand the project isn\u2019t just the fun bits before and during and it\u2019s a big compatibility issue.\n\nIf the point is to make homemade cookies that taste notably homemade, thick and buttery for example versus thin and Crisco like a storebought one then making more is not an achievement. It is missing the point. You\u2019ll already annoy the person who had a brief in mind and if you over run budget (did the 40% include energy time in the oven and gas for grocery runs which are both major extra costs right now or just the extra ingredients?) and then  don\u2019t have your mise en place right so the place is as clean and orderly as possible, you are baking to a hard to win over audience. It snowballs.\n\nYou should probably both talk about why you chose your methods. You\u2019ll both learn. I have picked up so many tips from ADHD engineer food types that are golden but I always remind them no one is too smart or disruptor to ignore dishes unless you have paid staff for each level.", "You don't have to go into your finances on the internet, but it might be worth thinking about the budget side of it, especially if your income is irregular or a lot of it goes to your schooling.", "But was that the point of it to begin with?

It was always a power move on her behalf.

You wouldn't call that being justifiably upset, yet you flip the genders and suddenly you're making excuses.\n\nHer anger comes from the fact that she didn't get to be the Keebler Slavemaster for a day and the elves were even more efficient without her cracking the whip.\n\nNTA.

It's the entire friend group, it just so happens to be in their home. As long as the owner is there, there is no problem. And even if they aren't there they could ask a trusted friend to make sure everything goes well.\n\nI have the same tradition in my home. There are countless times when we changed the place or when i wasn't available, or left early.\n\nSpouses aren't each other's prisoners.

Who tf does that with cookie baking?", "He says he's getting an engineering degree, \"how to bake the most cookies in the time given\" sounds like a puzzle to solve through math the same way a lot of engineering can be. He just wanted to play through the puzzle. Because puzzles are fun.", "Not an engineer. But I have the same. I love all of it and made process optimization my job.

But if the metro and the train align perfectly and then my bus aligns with no waiting time with the train I get a dopamine shot. Bonus if the bus doesn\u2019t stop before my stop.

You can hurt people on accident. \n\nI do however believe that the wife should just have asked the husband not to go ahead with the baking instead of egging him on. It kinda seems like she wanted him to make a fiasco out of the whole thing and that's also shitty behaviour against someone you love. I honestly feel like the wife is more at fault here since she didn't communicate her feelings clearly and seems to have been expecting a failure to be smug about while the husband just did his thing without ill intent.

Then that is very different than what OP is doing, at least from my perspective.\n\nIn that Captain Awkward post, OP's husband was putting her down verbally and wouldn't trust her at all. He was micromanaging, and ironically not running his marriage efficiently.

We don't have any control over it. There have been days when I've been completely free with 0 obligations, and dearly want to do some of my hobbies - reading, baking, art, gaming - but I can't even start any of them because my brain has chosen to hyperfocus on something else, like scrolling reddit or reorganising my wardrobe when I don't want to OR have to do either of those things. \n\nOf course, yes it can still suck when your partner has executive dysfunction and can't do seemingly simple things, then all of a sudden can bake hundreds of cookies.

We rate them on several aspects: taste, sweet/sour, mouthfeel, presentation, and booziness (perceived) on a scale of 0-6.

It\u2019s an improvement but only in one single aspect of a dish that has multiple parts to it which make it so good. \n\nSo was I wrong? No. Was I trying to be an asshole? No. Was I being an asshole? Honestly, now that I look back on it.. yeah, I should have just kept my mouth shut. \n\nPeople are emotional. Not everything has to be practical and rational. Sometimes it\u2019s better to just let people enjoy something. \n\nI tried to improve on my mom\u2019s matzah ball soup for a few years and now I just make it the way she does, even though from a classic culinary perspective she does it \u201cwrong\u201d. \n\nIf someone tried to tell me how to make it now I\u2019d tell them to fuck off. I know the \u201cright\u201d way, but I like my mom\u2019s way better at this point.", "Because he didn't fail like she assumed/hoped? Or because she can't gate keep anymore?", "Nope but she does like to be part of the tradition?", "You mean you wouldn't be a gate keeping baby with an ego about it?", "Exactly as any other mature adult would.\n\nOPs wife has control issues. Imagine thinking your husband can't bake cookies without you.", "like give each person a station.  one person makes the dough, another rolls out the dough, next person cuts out the shapes, so on and so forth so you have an entire assembly line.", "That sentiment is valid. But her reaction invalidates that point as she made it about OP upstaging her after she implied he would fail. This is all about ego.", "Pecan was one of them and honestly  I don't remember  what else I took.", "I feel like a lot of assessments and the original post itself are missing a lot of points. A good example to use is the whole \"Only a 40% increase in costs!\" thing. This baking marathon apparently lasts like 12 hours. According to a very basic and simple sugar cookie recipe I looked up, one batch of 36 cookies takes a measly 6-9 minutes to bake. Assuming they only have one oven (although the assembly line capabilities here make me lean toward there being more, but I digress) that means in the past they've always had the capability to bake AT LEAST 2,880 COOKIES. WHAT. That does not sound fun at all, so I'm going to assume OP's wife had this be such a long event because everyone was having fun socializing and taking their time with frosting the cookies and that she was absolutely NOT prioritizing \"more cookie\". But still, there must have been a LOT of cookies coming out of that house for them to be there that long. Let's be extremely generous with the downtime and oven space and say they only baked 3 batches every hour (3 trays per batch, enough to fill one standard oven), that's already 36 batches in one day (1,296 cookies!) If we calculate the ingredients based on where I'm at, that would be around $165 spent on ingredients. Maybe I'm just poor but that seems like plenty to spend on cookies that are just frosting vehicles to me. And if that's how much she was making and how much it cost, he spent $66 extra for no reason except to prove some weird point to her or to himself that he can bake tons and tons of cookies like it's a factory! To the point where he literally had MORE ingredients purchased when they ran out, instead of being like \"Oh cool, we reached our quota faster than expected and now we can just spend the rest of the time chilling\". Nope, tunnel vision wins. And this isn't even including the price of the frosting itself, which there's no mention of making so I'm going assume they used canned stuff. For 36 batches that's probably $120-140, so 40% of that is an additional $48-$55! I guess I can see why people thinking his ADHD engineer brain could be endearing, (Maybe in the same way that some people find Sheldon Cooper funny) but the problem is not with how he finds this fun. It's how much he disregarded other factors to have his fun. \r  \n\r  \nMoney? Sure, it was over $100 more but it was only 40% and look at our pointless but impressive output!! \r  \n\r  \nThe fact that his wife is feeling sad by not being included in her favorite tradition where she feels most wanted and involved and now it turns out the cookie production improves without her? The fact that that opinion even being valid in the first place is entirely based on more cookies = better and thus entirely missing the point of a get-together AND the point of yummy cookies? \r  \n\r  \nThe fact that most people - except maybe the CEO's of Hostess and Nestle - would agree that quality = better, and there's no actual way that anyone with a functioning sweet tooth thinks thinner cookies are an improvement? It's more likely that it just doesn't matter that much to the guests (Which I'm sure is another lovely hit to the pride for the wife). \r  \n\r  \nThe fact that this mentality surrounding mass produced foods is an absolute scourge and not something to consider an achievement? \r  \n\r  \nAND there's zero mention of whether more cookies were ever truly needed. Was your wife not reaching the amount of cookies needed when she was the one baking them? You never mention that being an issue, so she was probably doing just fine on that front. If that\u2019s the case, why did you feel the need to improve it? I kind of believe you that it wasn't with malicious intent to upstage your wife, but if it wasn't then that means you committed to this \"improvement\" without thinking about how it could negatively impact things and instead just wanted to feel pride over managing to bake an unnecessary amount of the world\u2019s easiest cookie to bake for no substantial reason. I'm not sure that's much better, and it also makes less sense. \r  \n\r  \nBut none of it matters. None of it matters because MOAR COOKIE x3\r  \n\r  \nOP, despite all of this angering stuff, I consider you NAH in this specific exchange. You are NAH simply because your wife was so emotionally dependent on this tradition that she became gatekeep-y and jealous, although your bot brain doesn't even seem to consider being hurt by that. Her reaction does make me wonder whether anyone ever gives her praise or recognition, but I acknowledge that that is speculation and not an excuse for name calling. It was also childish of her to not recognize and communicate that she felt hurt.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, from your thought processes during this situation and how it's entirely centered around a crap ton of stuff that isn't the point, I will say you're probably pretty insufferable to be married to. Please learn how emotions work for the sake of your marriage. Thank you.", "We host an annual block party BBQ with our neighbors where I usually smoke a couple pork shoulders and a few racks of ribs for the pot luck - at this point it's expected.  One year I couldn't make it due to a work trip.\n\nWhat did I do?  I taught my wife how to operate the smoker and cook a pork shoulder, and I wished her good luck in a non-snarky manner.  She made the pulled pork, the neighbors enjoyed it, and I was happy for her.  By all accounts it was great.\n\nWhat did I not do?  I didn't expect her to not participate in the block party, or suggest that she was incapable of smoking meat.\n\nIs BBQ my thing?  Absolutely.
