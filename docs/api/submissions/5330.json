We'd then give the cookies out to freinds and family and helpers. \n\nEvery year, my wife would take on the bulk of the baking duties, insisting that only she knew how to bake them \"right\" and only letting whoever is helping frost them. She always insisted on doing all the baking because frosting is the fun part and the only thing people want to do. Usually this frosting and baking marathon would last until the wee hours of the morning, and Sstart around noon.\n\nWell, this year, for reasons that aren't relevant to this post today, she would not be available on the day we normally do all of this. She was sad that we wouldn't be able to do our cookie tradition. I said that I was more than capable of baking the cookies. She seemed to think I was joking and that I could bassicly never do it myself. Well, I said I'd try, and she wished me a sarcastic good luck.\n\nWell, in the run-up to the days of baking and frosting, I  start running drills to optimize production. (Enter testing and tragic mistake montage)I started rearranging the house in various configurations, running tests on the dough we were using to see how long it took to bake and making appropriate changes while running it by taste testers, substituting ingredients for quicker bake time while preserving taste, making the cookies as thin as possible without comprising frosting ratio, canvas space for creativity, and/or comprising structural integrity, etc.\n\nCome the day of baking, I have everything down to a science. As freinds and family come in, I give them the run down. After a couple hours most kinks are worked out, and cookies are flowing out at a breakneck pace. Eventually, we start running out of material! Something that never happened under my wife's Aegis. We start making runs to the store for the necessary raw materials to fuel our mighty cookie forges! \n\nBy the time we were exhausted around 2 a.m., we had produced at least 5 times the amount of cookies we ever had before. \n\nWell my wife gets home a couple days later and is weirdly upset. She insists the cookies taste weird, that we spent to much money, and that I was actively trying to make her look bad by making so much more than her.\n\nIn truth, I ran blind tests to see if anyone could differentiate between our old recipe and mine, and no one could. I also only spent 40% more than years previous as I slotted in some cheaper ingredients and bought some stuff in bulk, and I had absolutely zero intention of upstaging her, I simply had the goal of \"maximize cookie production\" \n\nShe says that even if I didn't do it on purpose that I should have thought about how it made her look to out circles and that I have embarrassed her, and she actually called me an asshole.

You wanted to bake more cookies than she usually baked, which implies her way is inefficient. \n\nYou state that prior to this, your wife insisted on baking because of two reasons: only she could do it \u201cright\u201d and because no one else wanted to bake, everyone wanted to frost. Have you considered that maybe your wife would have appreciated some help with the baking so that she could also participate in frosting some cookies? Now you\u2019ve shown her that you could have been helping to bake this whole time. \n\nI know I may seem like a Grinch for voting you the AH for basically being over exuberant, but you are unfortunately the person in this scenario whose actions caused another person to feel bad. I will not call her an AH for having feelings and expressing them to you, and therefore I vehemently disagree with all the N-T-A votes.

It could make her feel inferior and maybe even like you did it purposefully. She didn\u2019t need to call you names or sarcastically insinuate you were incapable at the start, but it\u2019s understandable.\n\nYour best course of action would be to apologize for hurting her in any way, even if unintentional, and explain your thought process like you did here.

It made it so that none of us ended up having fun, and as we got older, we didn't want to participate.
