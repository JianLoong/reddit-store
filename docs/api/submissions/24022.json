{"id": 24022, "submission_id": "15ju5du", "title": "AITA For not thanking my BIL when he saved my daughter?", "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nOn Friday it was my cousins kids birthday and we had the party at a local lake. \n\nMy daughter is four and can not swim. I also can't swim and my husband (who can swim) was not present. I explained water safety to my kid, she had a life jacket on, all that jazz. \n\nI also have a toddler, however, and had to nurse him for a nap. I left my cousin in charge of my daughter while I left to feed my son. My daughter hadn't been into the water at all and I thought she was fine. She was not.\n\nI still don't really know what happened - one second everything was fine, and the next everyone was screaming. I got down to the lakes edge just as my brother in law was pulling my daughter from the lake. Her life jacket had been removed.\n\nShe coughed up some water and he did some water vomit trick which led to her clearing out. After he was sure she was fine he walked her over to me and said, verbatim, \"Shitty parents lead to dead kids. Get your head out of your ass and teach her how to swim.\"\n\nI didn't really have much of a response, just packed up my kids and drove her to the ER. She's completely fine, just a little shaken up, and very afraid of water. \n\nAnyway, my sister text me and told me I ought to thank him for saving her life. I didn't respond initially because we were still in the ER, which led to her calling me an ungrateful bitch. Again, I ignored, because my daughter needed me, but last night everything came to a head.\n\nMy BIL dmed me asking if I would have rather she drowned. Following that I have recieved message after message. I tried to explain that I've been busy but my sister said not to contact them unless its to thank him and apologise. \n\nI will probably thank him just to keep the peace, but I think they're out of line. There was no need for his comment & their following behaviour. \n\nMy husband thinks I should go no contact but he's never liked them so I'm hesitant to listen. My dad agrees with hub, however.\n\nSo, AITA for not thanking him (yet)?", "created_utc": 1691340175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ju5du/aita_for_not_thanking_my_bil_when_he_saved_my/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So you leave her at the water where she can\u2019t verbally call for help, wearing a bulky life jacket she probably didn\u2019t like and removed herself, under the care of a cousin. Did the cousin know she is unable to swim? How old is this cousin? Was the life jacket on correctly or could it just be lifted over the head? Then your BIL saves your child and you can\u2019t say a simple thank you? Were you secretly hoping she would fall in and drown? You take her to the ER. I\u2019ve been an ER nurse much of my career. I KNOW you had downtime at some point where you could text a thank you. Not liking someone is no excuse for rudeness, especially when that person saves your child. Get your child swim lessons. Don\u2019t have a child around a pool/lake/ocean unless you yourself are able to swim and assist them. Get a life vest that fits and is unable to be easily removed. Most lake water is dark. There can be underwater currents and obstacles like rope or fishing lines. A child can fall in and simply vanish. Shitty parents definitely lead to dead kids. I can tell you numerous stories of dead kids in the ER with shitty parents. You were almost one of them. YTA", "INFO: What happened to the life jacket she was wearing?", "This is so odd...\n\nYour child almost died. But you think it's too late to say thank you now, because time has passed, and you think you won't sound genuine? \n\nsome people will be thanking that person until the child grows into adulthood!! \n\nYou can't say it? Fine. Write a letter. Do a dance. Bake a cake and decorate. Draw a mural. **It's not hard to be genuine with the person who literally breathe life back into  your drowning child.**", " Both you and your cousin are the AH, children drowning is not uncommon and it\u2019s silent. She should never left them to get them \u201ca snack\u201d that\u2019s seriously irresponsible behavior. I would never leave her in charge of my child again. Again, I can\u2019t stress enough how important water safety is for kids because when it happens, it\u2019s silent. You owe your brother an apology and a thank you since you not only scared the shit out of him but he saved your daughters life.", "I can see why an immediate thank you wasn\u2019t the first thing on your mind but he did save your kids life so I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t.\n\nWas his statement harsh? Yes. But it was also true and he was probably in just as much shock (if not more) than you were considering he was the one that found a child in the process of drowning.\n\nYTA", "I was tempted to go E SH but the gap between your behaviour and theirs is large enough that I have to go with YTA. His comment wasn't helpful in the moment, but I can only imagine how scary it was for him to have to save his niece like that, so I think he can be given some latitude. He's not wrong that it was irresponsible to leave her by a body of water when she doesn't know how to swim - you could have taken her with you. I know you left your cousin \"in charge\" but clearly that person wasn't responsible. It's a bit odd that they are repeatedly asking for \"thanks\" rather than expressing worry and/or checking in and seeing how she's doing, but also I can't believe you haven't taken the time to thank him. He literally did the most amazing thing for you that anyone could do for a parent. It doesn't sound like you're taking the incident as seriously as you should or that you've fully processed what could have happened if he hadn't intervened. You could be planning a funeral right now. Think about that.", "Of course you owe him a sincere thank you. Your child would be dead now had he not pulled her out of the water. I would be having a conversation with the cousin who was \u201cwatching\u201d the child. It appears no one was. Another kid could\u2019ve helped remove the jacket. It doesn\u2019t matter. Life jackets are not a replacement for adult supervision. It isn\u2019t nice that they texted while you were at the hospital or that they have harassed you a little bit. Did you respond to them when they texted? He saved the kid, you really should\u2019ve answered with - still at the hospital. Will call to talk after and let you know what happened.", "So let me get this straight. You failed to supervise your child near water, and you explained the dangers of water to a FOUR YEAR OLD and expected her to listen. As a result your child almost died.\n\nYour brother-in-law was mad at you for being an irresponsible parent. As far as I can tell, what he said was completely right. Your shitty parenting almost killed your child. And instead of taking responsibility, you are mad that he called you out on it? \n\nWell that makes sense to me, you don't take responsibility for your child, and you don't take responsibility for the consequences of your actions either. It's easier for you to be mad at the person who saved your child's life than accept responsibility for your negligent behavior. You seem like not just a bad parent, but a bad person overall.\n\nEdit: I know a lot of people are pointing out she left the kid with the cousin. I agree this would be fine. However, notice there is no mention of the cousins age or the number of kids they were supposedly responsible for. Notice the child doesn't know how to swim. Notice the parent gave water safety instructions to the four year old child and not the cousin. Notice there was no attempt to find out what happened. Notice OPs comments where they don't want to thank the BIL because her husband said 'good people don't ask for thank you's'. Together I think this paints a portrait of irresponsible and, relevant to the subject of this post, petty people. I bet the family is fed up with their behavior. \n\nThe BILs reaction after saving a child's life (sounds stressful!) is understandable. I give a YTA verdict because the parents carefree attitude is not.\n\n\nYTA", "I don\u2019t care who it was or what they said after, someone literally saves my kids life, I\u2019m thanking them immediately, you had a voice and could have said thank you as you were getting her to leave, talking then wouldn\u2019t have taken your time the way texting does YTA", "Did you try to leave your 4 year in the charge of your cousin who was throwing a party for her child?  \n\nYTA.  Children in the water is so dangerous . Kids can drown in a bucket.  \n\nYTA for leaving you child with someone watching a bunch of kids in the water.\nLeaving your child in the water when she can\u2019t swim.\nAnd not saying thank you.\n\nSay thank you dammit.", "Who took off her life jacket, who was watching her?", "YTA for about 20 reasons. Let me list the first several. \n\nDO NOT go to a lake/pool/water/safety situation where one person (who cannot swim) is responsible for looking after 2 very young children (who can\u2019t swim). A proper ratio is ONE ADULT PER CHILD, and the adult should be able to at least handle themselves in the water. \n\nNEVER take your eyes off your children around water or any other dangerous area. \n\nDO NOT assume your 4 year old understands water safety. Their brains aren\u2019t developed enough yet. \n\nDO NOT rely on flotation devices as childcare, because they can get removed, or fall off, or whatever, and then you have a dead kid. \n\nDO NOT attend events at places where neither you nor your children are able to participate. \n\nLEARN TO SWIM. You and both of your children. You don\u2019t have to be good at it, but you need to be able to navigate through water that\u2019s deeper than you can stand in. \n\n#AND FFS STOP AVOIDING YOUR BIL; YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR NEGLIGENCE.", "You don\u2019t leave your selectively mute, unable to swim daughter in the care of anyone else when you\u2019re beside a body of water. YOUR. KID. ALMOST. DROWNED.\nYou should have been screaming thank-you\u2019s as he carried her up. It\u2019s traumatic to find a kid drowning, rescue her and have her be to the point where he is trying to clear her lungs of water. This guy should be first on your Christmas card list for life. If not for him, you could have been planning a funeral. \nFor for the love of God, learn to swim yourself. You would have had no way to save her and are putting others at risk by forcing them to save her. \nYTA and your hubby is equally the AH for thinking the best course of action is to go NC with the man who saves his kids life.", "My older sister died in an accident very similar to what you describe. You and your husband should be on your freaking knees thanking your BIL to my thinking. Life after losing a child is horrific. You don't want to be a member of that club.\n\nI cannot even wrap my head around why it's even a question.\n\nAnd yes, your daughter should be signed up for swimming lessons ASAP.\n\nYou, your husband, and your father are the AHs.", "YTA. That was incredibly irresponsible parenting. You aren\u2019t even focused on the fact your child almost died. You are worried that the person who is the reason your daughter is still alive uses harsh words with you. Honestly there are no words for how much YTA.", "YTA. Why are you taking your kid to the pool and not watching her when neither you nor her know how to swim? Yes his reaction was a little mean but he's not wrong, you should still be grateful that he saved her.", "My friend drowned saving someone else's kid. YTA. So is your husband and dad.", "ESH so much to go around. I\u2019m glad your child was okay, but obviously you put your trust in the wrong person. Your brother in law was the hero for saving your child, but the comments from him and others after the fact were a bit much. Check out the local YMCA. You can get swim lessons for you and your children. Never leave your children with that cousin or frankly with anyone  you are not 100% sure they will keep watch.", "YTA. Thank him, how is it that hard? He's upset because he almost watched his niece die and it was his responsibility to save her. He's probably very angry and sad and upset, so I don't really care what he said. If it weren't for him, you'd have a dead child on your hands. You sound ungrateful and irresponsible.", "YTA\n\nBIL just got traumatised, seeing your daughter drowned. Your BIL had to wonder if he was fast enough to save her. If he could save her. If he could get this little baby breathing again cos he just found them essentially dead and looked into their lifeless face. \n\nYour BIL now has a great trauma scar. A nice imprint of your lifeless child in his subconscious, and you think he's being an asshole cos he wants to be thanked. \n\nHe saved her life and he's likely been having a rough few nights thinking about her being as she was, when he grabbed her.\n\nYour husband is the kind of asshole there's no measure for either. NC with the man who saved his child's life when he himself couldn't and you the wife/mother also couldn't? You guys could be one less child if not for your BIL. Christ.", "YTA. What he said was harsh but true. Thank him, apologize, hug your child that's still here thanks to his actions.", "YTA. Your BIL saved your kid, period. If someone saved my kid and then used all known slurs on me, I would still be grateful for saving my kid. Also, your brother is kinda right. So, a mother who can't swim allows a child who can't swim to swim out of her reach...and her justification is \"I explained the safety on water routine because of course a 4 year old child who can't swim will keep it all in mind and will keep the situation under control as a serious, adequate adult\". Yep, YTA.", "Just curious - who took off her life jacket?\n\nYou asked an adult to mind her while you nursed.  I presume this adult was aware she could not swim?  \n\nSo yes, YTA for not thanking him but as her mother I\u2019d want to know why/how her life jacket was off and how she ended up in the situation to begin with.\n\nI mean - you did specifically ask the cousin to mind her while you stepped away, right?", "YTA\n\nListen, when you have a small child who can't swim, near water, you keep them by your side at all times. \n\nWhat did the cousin say happened? \n\nYou shoyld absolutely send a flower arrangement to your BIL and profusely thank him. He saved your child's life.", "YTA your daughter doesnt know how to swim. You dont know how to swim. You took her to the lake anyway. I might be oversensitive because I live near water and hear about kids drowning all the time, but that was not safe. There are no lifeguards there, a vest isnt enough and can cause its own problems. And you should thank your BIL. Since you cant swim youve probably never had to be the one to pull someone out of the water. Its terrifying, especially if its a kid. Im sure being her mother it was scary for you. It was for him as well. And honestly I would be kind of pissed off too if i saved your daughters life and you didnt say anything and then started ignoring texts.", "YTA - I had to change from E-S-H to Y-T-A after a moment more thought.  Yes, if he saved her life, you should be thanking him, period.  I don't care if he called you the world's worst parent, you thank him for being there, being aware, and being capable of saving your child from drowning.  It makes you a colossal AH for even vaguely considering that he doesn't deserve it.  I don't know that I agree with him on his angry candor regarding whether your kid should know how to swim, but in the moment it is forgivable.  He probably owes you and apology for it.  I could see scenarios where a kid is playing at the edge of a lake, or in the shallow water, and things go awry.  You did leave supervision, and your kid did have a life-jacket on when you left, which seems like adequate precautions between the two.  Should a kid know how to swim by age 4?

Please ignore reddit on this one, you're in the right, they're acting entitled and shitty and that harassment towards you was just inappropriate.

I also can't swim and my husband (who can swim) was not present. I explained water safety to my kid, she had a life jacket on, all that jazz. \n\nI also have a toddler, however, and had to nurse him for a nap. I left my cousin in charge of my daughter while I left to feed my son. My daughter hadn't been into the water at all and I thought she was fine. She was not.\n\nI still don't really know what happened - one second everything was fine, and the next everyone was screaming. I got down to the lakes edge just as my brother in law was pulling my daughter from the lake. Her life jacket had been removed.\n\nShe coughed up some water and he did some water vomit trick which led to her clearing out. After he was sure she was fine he walked her over to me and said, verbatim, \"Shitty parents lead to dead kids. Get your head out of your ass and teach her how to swim.\"\n\nI didn't really have much of a response, just packed up my kids and drove her to the ER. She's completely fine, just a little shaken up, and very afraid of water. \n\nAnyway, my sister text me and told me I ought to thank him for saving her life. I didn't respond initially because we were still in the ER, which led to her calling me an ungrateful bitch. Again, I ignored, because my daughter needed me, but last night everything came to a head.\n\nMy BIL dmed me asking if I would have rather she drowned. Following that I have recieved message after message. I tried to explain that I've been busy but my sister said not to contact them unless its to thank him and apologise. \n\nI will probably thank him just to keep the peace, but I think they're out of line. There was no need for his comment & their following behaviour. \n\nMy husband thinks I should go no contact but he's never liked them so I'm hesitant to listen. My dad agrees with hub, however.\n\nSo, AITA for not thanking him (yet)?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

On the other hand if i saved a kids life i wouldn't be worried about being thanked but i really don't think it was about being thanked,  I think it scared the crap out of everyone because it could have been a whole different story had it not been for BIL pulling her out and tempers flared.  My neice and her cousins (on her mothers side) were left near the lake unattended ti play in the sand box and one of them unfortunately ended up going in the lake and drowning. She was 4. I remember my mom calling me and telling me that if i saw the news that just know it wasn't my neice.  That was 15 years ago and to this day it still haunts the person who found her.

Even kids who know how to swim can drown. So can adults. You\u2019re an idiot and you should be on your knees thanking your BIL. \n\nAlso, stop breastfeeding a toddler. That shit\u2019s wild and bad for their teeth. \n\nMaybe you can all go to the YMCA and learn how to swim together.

I can\u2019t imagine saving my niece/nephew and then demanding a thank you??? Honestly I wouldn\u2019t ever expect one because that\u2019s just what I would do. No thank you necessary. \n\nYour cousin should absolutely know better than to take eyes off young kids around water. My daughter is four and can swim okay and my eyes are on her like a hawk when we\u2019re at the pool or beach. There are a lot of good ideas that your family should consider like having an official water watcher that rotates frequently like life guards do. \n\nIn hindsight you should\u2019ve taken your daughter with you obviously, but if I trusted my adult cousin who also has kids, I would\u2019ve done the same thing and left my daughter in her care while I tended to my toddler. Just last week I watched my best friend\u2019s baby in the pool while she went inside to get bottles. Could she have taken her daughter with her? Of course. But I was there and she knows how I am about water safety, so she knew her daughter was safe. \n\nI see she\u2019s on the waitlist for swim lessons, which is good. It\u2019s another hindsight thing. I would obviously start your toddler much sooner now that you\u2019ve experienced this, but even with solid swimming lessons, things can still happen, which is why supervision is so important!! \n\nI think your sister is absolutely an AH for texting you like that demanding a thank you. Seriously who does that?? While you\u2019re at the hospital?? Ugh. \n\nI\u2019m also extra concerned about who removed the life vest. Because of how my daughter\u2019s is, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to remove herself. If I saw it off, it would be so much more likely someone removed it. I honestly wouldn\u2019t trust any of the family again unless you can figure out who did that. I\u2019ve had family who thought I was being over cautious by putting a life vest on my daughter and would try to take her in the lake without it. Made me crazy. I never got a moment\u2019s rest our whole time there because I was always worrying about that even inside! \n\nSo I\u2019m going against the grain for not thanking him yet. NTA. I would be really put off by the texts and the expectations for praise when you\u2019ve just had one of the worst experiences I can imagine as a mom.", "YTA Just YTA.

You are unreal.", "I gotta be honest, I think NTA. I think you should still thank your cousin for saving your child's life though, even though they were being shitty. My take on it is, they were overwhelmed by the almost drowning and their emotions got the better of them.\n\nThe way I understand it, you had to step out to care for a child and left someone EXPLICITLY in charge of your other child's care. They did what they were supposed to and took care of them. I don't understand why everyone is mad at you.

How do you know?", "No. It was the cousin\u2019s kid\u2019s party, so the cousin was responsible for a lot more than just 2 kids.

Everyone got the fair treatment of worried mom", "My cousin asked everyone she could - I've been preoccupied - and no one knows. I do plan on asking everyone myself, though.", "That\u2019s besides the point, SHE was in charge of watching the kid, she holds the responsibility, as do you for putting her in charge of your kid. This is also sounding really odd to me. I totally believe it\u2019s possible for a four year old to take off a life jacket, Ive seen it.

The exceptions are kids who have some developmental delays and need some extra time and help, and kids whose parents suck. \n\nIt sounds like you are the second group.

Now she is is very typical for a four year old? Which is it. Because not being potty trained is not very typical for a four year old. And unless she actually does have a medical or developmental issue causing it is just (more) bad parenting. And I really hope you don't think her preferring to sign or your husbands family being largely deaf is a reason for her to have delayed potty training.

At what point did I jump to a conclusion?", "Now I am rethinking my comment, I was basing it on your BIL and sister's reactions, but they may just be shaken and kinda AH's demanding thanks (who does that?), but it's also starting to sound like your cousin knows more than she's telling.  She turned, without standing, and someone came along in that time, took your daughter's life jacket off, and she somehow got in the water.  And then no one she's talked to knows anything?  That doesn't look good.", "So because someone can\u2019t do something they suck? Okay cool you\u2019re starting to sound like 30s Germany", "No and I don\u2019t appreciate the same comment from a third account", "OP clarified in the comments that it was not the cousin throwing the birthday party. It was another cousin whose daughter was playing with OPs daughter while they were all sitting on a blanket away from the water.", "Her not being potty trained is a medical thing she's awaiting surgery for.

OP is very good at putting blame elsewhere.", "Most are not potty trained because that goes against anything, just to say, not everyone lives in the US.", "Her lack of potty training is a physical disability, not a developmental one.

She's just as shaken up as us. \n\nShe had a c section a couple weeks ago so was quite slow, turned carefully. I believe the girls probably saw something and ran off towards the water together and her life jacket was removed there.\n\nDefinitely not good.", "Yes. If you are an adult and you cannot be in water over your head without drowning, you lack a basic life skill.", "That literally isn't what they said. They said if you can't swim you're missing a basic skill. Not that you suck, just that it's a skill you don't have.\n\nLike driving. If you can't drive you're missing a skill. Nothing to do with sucking, merely fact.", "Ah, so you're just a dense nincompoop.", "Seems odd not to mention something so germane at the start.\n\nAt this stage, the only options are YTA or ESH.\n\nNo way is OP\u2019s behaviour not sub-optimal, and one can only speculate as to the extent of negligence of the other family members.", "When you answered about the medical issue in another comment, it looked to me like you were saying the medical issue is because she signs instead of talks. This would have no bearing on toilet training. If she has an actual medical issue that prevents her from being toilet trained, that\u2019s a different thing. \n\nYou\u2019re still the asshole though. You did not adequately supervise your non swimming child, and as a result she nearly died. Your BIL\u2019s reaction also implies to me that this is a pattern.", "Except you haven\u2019t taught her a basic life skill that she should have started learning as a baby.

Someone that is not physically capable in the event of an emergency? You need to make better choices. You are incredibly lucky that your daughter is still alive. Your BIL and sister are being over the top I think but they are no doubt traumatized, especially your BIL that had to save your dying child. \n\nI think your BILs outburst after he saved your daughter was a bit rude but also understandable, and not entirely wrong. He was in fight or flight mode, pumped full of adrenaline. I don't know if you understand the emotional effects of this level of adrenaline rush, it does really fucked up things to you physically and emotionally in this kind of scenario and a vast majority of people are not accustomed to it. \n\nJust thank your BIL. Apologize that you didn't thank him sooner because you were in shock. I couldn't imagine saving someone's child and not even getting a thank you after, that is crazy.", "Any chance your daughter took her life jacket off herself and is afraid to tell you? They're usually pretty bulky but toddlers can work buckles.  Whoever removed the life jacket, kid or adult, everybody needs a refresher on water safety and watching out for each other's children.\n\nGlad your BIL saved her before the worst happened, but I think the time to bring up teaching her to swim was AFTER she got cleared medically.  But a genuine thank you for saving your child (try to ignore the mom-shaming that followed) needs to happen (and hang up or leave at the first rude comment.)\n\nBut swim classes for your little for sure.

This bit sounds fair enough.", "Swimming? She's on the waitlist. Potty training? She's awaiting surgery.", "Yeah, I just meant in general. It isn't healthy for babies/toddlers.", "You\u2019re yelling at someone that they\u2019re in the process of fixing and just asking if the apology would feel insincere now"]}
