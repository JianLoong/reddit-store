{"id": 24022, "submission_id": "15ju5du", "title": "AITA For not thanking my BIL when he saved my daughter?", "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nOn Friday it was my cousins kids birthday and we had the party at a local lake. \n\nMy daughter is four and can not swim. I also can't swim and my husband (who can swim) was not present. I explained water safety to my kid, she had a life jacket on, all that jazz. \n\nI also have a toddler, however, and had to nurse him for a nap. I left my cousin in charge of my daughter while I left to feed my son. My daughter hadn't been into the water at all and I thought she was fine. She was not.\n\nI still don't really know what happened - one second everything was fine, and the next everyone was screaming. I got down to the lakes edge just as my brother in law was pulling my daughter from the lake. Her life jacket had been removed.\n\nShe coughed up some water and he did some water vomit trick which led to her clearing out. After he was sure she was fine he walked her over to me and said, verbatim, \"Shitty parents lead to dead kids. Get your head out of your ass and teach her how to swim.\"\n\nI didn't really have much of a response, just packed up my kids and drove her to the ER. She's completely fine, just a little shaken up, and very afraid of water. \n\nAnyway, my sister text me and told me I ought to thank him for saving her life. I didn't respond initially because we were still in the ER, which led to her calling me an ungrateful bitch. Again, I ignored, because my daughter needed me, but last night everything came to a head.\n\nMy BIL dmed me asking if I would have rather she drowned. Following that I have recieved message after message. I tried to explain that I've been busy but my sister said not to contact them unless its to thank him and apologise. \n\nI will probably thank him just to keep the peace, but I think they're out of line. There was no need for his comment & their following behaviour. \n\nMy husband thinks I should go no contact but he's never liked them so I'm hesitant to listen. My dad agrees with hub, however.\n\nSo, AITA for not thanking him (yet)?", "created_utc": 1691340175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ju5du/aita_for_not_thanking_my_bil_when_he_saved_my/", "score": 2431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So you leave her at the water where she can\u2019t verbally call for help, wearing a bulky life jacket she probably didn\u2019t like and removed herself, under the care of a cousin. Did the cousin know she is unable to swim? How old is this cousin? Was the life jacket on correctly or could it just be lifted over the head? Then your BIL saves your child and you can\u2019t say a simple thank you? Were you secretly hoping she would fall in and drown? You take her to the ER. I\u2019ve been an ER nurse much of my career. I KNOW you had downtime at some point where you could text a thank you. Not liking someone is no excuse for rudeness, especially when that person saves your child. Get your child swim lessons. Don\u2019t have a child around a pool/lake/ocean unless you yourself are able to swim and assist them. Get a life vest that fits and is unable to be easily removed. Most lake water is dark. There can be underwater currents and obstacles like rope or fishing lines. A child can fall in and simply vanish. Shitty parents definitely lead to dead kids. I can tell you numerous stories of dead kids in the ER with shitty parents. You were almost one of them. YTA", "INFO: What happened to the life jacket she was wearing?", "This is so odd...\n\nYour child almost died. But you think it's too late to say thank you now, because time has passed, and you think you won't sound genuine? \n\nsome people will be thanking that person until the child grows into adulthood!! \n\nYou can't say it? Fine. Write a letter. Do a dance. Bake a cake and decorate. Draw a mural. **It's not hard to be genuine with the person who literally breathe life back into  your drowning child.**", " Both you and your cousin are the AH, children drowning is not uncommon and it\u2019s silent. She should never left them to get them \u201ca snack\u201d that\u2019s seriously irresponsible behavior. I would never leave her in charge of my child again. Again, I can\u2019t stress enough how important water safety is for kids because when it happens, it\u2019s silent. You owe your brother an apology and a thank you since you not only scared the shit out of him but he saved your daughters life.", "I can see why an immediate thank you wasn\u2019t the first thing on your mind but he did save your kids life so I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t.\n\nWas his statement harsh? Yes. But it was also true and he was probably in just as much shock (if not more) than you were considering he was the one that found a child in the process of drowning.\n\nYTA", "I was tempted to go E SH but the gap between your behaviour and theirs is large enough that I have to go with YTA. His comment wasn't helpful in the moment, but I can only imagine how scary it was for him to have to save his niece like that, so I think he can be given some latitude. He's not wrong that it was irresponsible to leave her by a body of water when she doesn't know how to swim - you could have taken her with you. I know you left your cousin \"in charge\" but clearly that person wasn't responsible. It's a bit odd that they are repeatedly asking for \"thanks\" rather than expressing worry and/or checking in and seeing how she's doing, but also I can't believe you haven't taken the time to thank him. He literally did the most amazing thing for you that anyone could do for a parent. It doesn't sound like you're taking the incident as seriously as you should or that you've fully processed what could have happened if he hadn't intervened. You could be planning a funeral right now. Think about that.", "Of course you owe him a sincere thank you. Your child would be dead now had he not pulled her out of the water. I would be having a conversation with the cousin who was \u201cwatching\u201d the child. It appears no one was. Another kid could\u2019ve helped remove the jacket. It doesn\u2019t matter. Life jackets are not a replacement for adult supervision. It isn\u2019t nice that they texted while you were at the hospital or that they have harassed you a little bit. Did you respond to them when they texted? He saved the kid, you really should\u2019ve answered with - still at the hospital. Will call to talk after and let you know what happened.", "So let me get this straight. You failed to supervise your child near water, and you explained the dangers of water to a FOUR YEAR OLD and expected her to listen. As a result your child almost died.\n\nYour brother-in-law was mad at you for being an irresponsible parent. As far as I can tell, what he said was completely right. Your shitty parenting almost killed your child. And instead of taking responsibility, you are mad that he called you out on it? \n\nWell that makes sense to me, you don't take responsibility for your child, and you don't take responsibility for the consequences of your actions either. It's easier for you to be mad at the person who saved your child's life than accept responsibility for your negligent behavior. \n\nEdit: I know a lot of people are pointing out she left the kid with the cousin. I agree this would be fine. However, notice there is no mention of the cousins age or the number of kids they were supposedly responsible for. Notice the child doesn't know how to swim and has a verbal delay/is selectively mute and cannot call for help. Notice the parent gave water safety instructions to the four year old child and not the cousin. Notice there was no attempt to find out what happened. Notice OPs comments where they don't want to thank the BIL because her husband said 'good people don't ask for thank you's' and 'she thinks it will be fake'. Together I think this paints a portrait of irresponsible and, relevant to the subject of this post, petty people. I bet the family is fed up with their behavior. \n\nThe BILs reaction after saving a child's life (sounds stressful!) is understandable. I give a YTA verdict because the parents self absorbed attitude is not.\n\n\nYTA", "I don\u2019t care who it was or what they said after, someone literally saves my kids life, I\u2019m thanking them immediately, you had a voice and could have said thank you as you were getting her to leave, talking then wouldn\u2019t have taken your time the way texting does YTA", "Did you try to leave your 4 year in the charge of your cousin who was throwing a party for her child?  \n\nYTA.  Children in the water is so dangerous . Kids can drown in a bucket.  \n\nYTA for leaving you child with someone watching a bunch of kids in the water.\nLeaving your child in the water when she can\u2019t swim.\nAnd not saying thank you.\n\nSay thank you dammit.", "Who took off her life jacket, who was watching her?", "YTA for about 20 reasons. Let me list the first several. \n\nDO NOT go to a lake/pool/water/safety situation where one person (who cannot swim) is responsible for looking after 2 very young children (who can\u2019t swim). A proper ratio is ONE ADULT PER CHILD, and the adult should be able to at least handle themselves in the water. \n\nNEVER take your eyes off your children around water or any other dangerous area. \n\nDO NOT assume your 4 year old understands water safety. Their brains aren\u2019t developed enough yet. \n\nDO NOT rely on flotation devices as childcare, because they can get removed, or fall off, or whatever, and then you have a dead kid. \n\nDO NOT attend events at places where neither you nor your children are able to participate. \n\nLEARN TO SWIM. You and both of your children. You don\u2019t have to be good at it, but you need to be able to navigate through water that\u2019s deeper than you can stand in. \n\n#AND FFS STOP AVOIDING YOUR BIL; YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR NEGLIGENCE.", "You don\u2019t leave your selectively mute, unable to swim daughter in the care of anyone else when you\u2019re beside a body of water. YOUR. KID. ALMOST. DROWNED.\nYou should have been screaming thank-you\u2019s as he carried her up. It\u2019s traumatic to find a kid drowning, rescue her and have her be to the point where he is trying to clear her lungs of water. This guy should be first on your Christmas card list for life. If not for him, you could have been planning a funeral. \nFor for the love of God, learn to swim yourself. You would have had no way to save her and are putting others at risk by forcing them to save her. \nYTA and your hubby is equally the AH for thinking the best course of action is to go NC with the man who saves his kids life.", "My older sister died in an accident very similar to what you describe. You and your husband should be on your freaking knees thanking your BIL to my thinking. Life after losing a child is horrific. You don't want to be a member of that club.\n\nI cannot even wrap my head around why it's even a question.\n\nAnd yes, your daughter should be signed up for swimming lessons ASAP.\n\nYou, your husband, and your father are the AHs.", "YTA. That was incredibly irresponsible parenting. You aren\u2019t even focused on the fact your child almost died. You are worried that the person who is the reason your daughter is still alive uses harsh words with you. Honestly there are no words for how much YTA.", "YTA. Why are you taking your kid to the pool and not watching her when neither you nor her know how to swim? Yes his reaction was a little mean but he's not wrong, you should still be grateful that he saved her.", "My friend drowned saving someone else's kid. YTA. So is your husband and dad.", "ESH so much to go around. I\u2019m glad your child was okay, but obviously you put your trust in the wrong person. Your brother in law was the hero for saving your child, but the comments from him and others after the fact were a bit much. Check out the local YMCA. You can get swim lessons for you and your children. Never leave your children with that cousin or frankly with anyone  you are not 100% sure they will keep watch.", "YTA. Thank him, how is it that hard? He's upset because he almost watched his niece die and it was his responsibility to save her. He's probably very angry and sad and upset, so I don't really care what he said. If it weren't for him, you'd have a dead child on your hands. You sound ungrateful and irresponsible.", "YTA\n\nBIL just got traumatised, seeing your daughter drowned. Your BIL had to wonder if he was fast enough to save her. If he could save her. If he could get this little baby breathing again cos he just found them essentially dead and looked into their lifeless face. \n\nYour BIL now has a great trauma scar. A nice imprint of your lifeless child in his subconscious, and you think he's being an asshole cos he wants to be thanked. \n\nHe saved her life and he's likely been having a rough few nights thinking about her being as she was, when he grabbed her.\n\nYour husband is the kind of asshole there's no measure for either. NC with the man who saved his child's life when he himself couldn't and you the wife/mother also couldn't? You guys could be one less child if not for your BIL. Christ.", "YTA. What he said was harsh but true. Thank him, apologize, hug your child that's still here thanks to his actions.", "YTA. Your BIL saved your kid, period. If someone saved my kid and then used all known slurs on me, I would still be grateful for saving my kid. Also, your brother is kinda right. So, a mother who can't swim allows a child who can't swim to swim out of her reach...and her justification is \"I explained the safety on water routine because of course a 4 year old child who can't swim will keep it all in mind and will keep the situation under control as a serious, adequate adult\". Yep, YTA.", "Just curious - who took off her life jacket?\n\nYou asked an adult to mind her while you nursed.  I presume this adult was aware she could not swim?  \n\nSo yes, YTA for not thanking him but as her mother I\u2019d want to know why/how her life jacket was off and how she ended up in the situation to begin with.\n\nI mean - you did specifically ask the cousin to mind her while you stepped away, right?", "YTA\n\nListen, when you have a small child who can't swim, near water, you keep them by your side at all times. \n\nWhat did the cousin say happened? \n\nYou shoyld absolutely send a flower arrangement to your BIL and profusely thank him. He saved your child's life.", "Your daughter doesnt know how to swim. You dont know how to swim. You took her to the lake anyway. I might be oversensitive because I live near water and hear about kids drowning all the time, but that was not safe. There are no lifeguards there, a vest isnt enough and can cause its own problems. And you should thank your BIL. Since you cant swim youve probably never had to be the one to pull someone out of the water. Its terrifying, especially if its a kid. Im sure being her mother it was scary for you. It was for him as well. And honestly I would be kind of pissed off too if i saved your daughters life and you didnt say anything and then started ignoring texts.  YTA", "YTA - I had to change from E-S-H to Y-T-A after a moment more thought.  Yes, if he saved her life, you should be thanking him, period.  I don't care if he called you the world's worst parent, you thank him for being there, being aware, and being capable of saving your child from drowning.  It makes you a colossal AH for even vaguely considering that he doesn't deserve it.  I don't know that I agree with him on his angry candor regarding whether your kid should know how to swim, but in the moment it is forgivable.  He probably owes you and apology for it.  I could see scenarios where a kid is playing at the edge of a lake, or in the shallow water, and things go awry.  You did leave supervision, and your kid did have a life-jacket on when you left, which seems like adequate precautions between the two.  Should a kid know how to swim by age 4?  Maybe if they are going to be playing in water deep enough to drown them?  I'm not sure.  The ongoing harassment by your sis and BIL is something you can end by just doing what's right.", "YTA. \n\nIf you specifically aren't guarding your child, someone else is.

Yes, he said a horrible thing but being scared does that to people.

Your BILs comment was way out of line and he did the bare minimum when he saved your child (btw I'm really curious and suspicious as to why the life jacket was gone in the first place, however it got removed, it wad the adults responsibility to get it back on immediately.) Honestly thanking him would be a courtesy he would deserve only of he had not made that comment and not been irresponsible enough to let the life jacket get removed. Please ignore reddit on this one, you're in the right, they're acting entitled and shitty and that harassment towards you was just inappropriate. I wish you and your daughter well and I hope you guys can put this incident behind you and it won't be a hindrance to her learning how to swim when she's old enough.

You cannot swim. Yet you took a toddler and an infant to a lake. You know so little about water safety that you believe a life vest is sufficient protection near a lake (I mean, there is usually a disclaimer printed right on the life vests that say \u201cnot a life saving device\u201d). You then left your toddler with a relative who just had major abdominal surgery and who wouldn\u2019t have been able to help your child even if she WAS watching your child carefully.  \n\nI think your BIL and sister handled this poorly.

You didn't abandon your daughter to go wild at this party, you just stepped away a few minutes to feed your toddler.

Perhaps the adult you chose wasn't a great choice (who took the life jacket off???) but that's not the question here.\n\nETA: Hey OP, I'm reading that your BIL and sister are hostile and racist to your husband. Is that part of the reason your husband was not at this party and available to help you? I also read that you nursed in the car because your family disagrees with breastfeeding, and that no one is owning up about the life jacket.\n\nKeeping in mind the sliver of info in this thread, the family dynamic at this party created an environment where your special needs child was often separated from both parents. I'm not saying anyone intentionally endangered your child, but they put up barriers that made parenting harder, put you in a position where you had to trust them, and then immediately blamed you when disaster struck. Whatever comes of this drama, please rethink trusting this group with your daughter's safety. Yes, BIL saved her life and no amount of gratitude will express what a gift that is. But if you weren't forced to leave the area or if your husband was able to be there, this situation might not have happened.", "NTA. Of course your BIL should get a \u201dthank you\u201d for saving your daughter\u2019s life, but in the most obvious moment when you would probably have said it, he was berating you for not having taught your *four* year old child to swim.

I also can't swim and my husband (who can swim) was not present. I explained water safety to my kid, she had a life jacket on, all that jazz. \n\nI also have a toddler, however, and had to nurse him for a nap. I left my cousin in charge of my daughter while I left to feed my son. My daughter hadn't been into the water at all and I thought she was fine. She was not.\n\nI still don't really know what happened - one second everything was fine, and the next everyone was screaming. I got down to the lakes edge just as my brother in law was pulling my daughter from the lake. Her life jacket had been removed.\n\nShe coughed up some water and he did some water vomit trick which led to her clearing out. After he was sure she was fine he walked her over to me and said, verbatim, \"Shitty parents lead to dead kids. Get your head out of your ass and teach her how to swim.\"\n\nI didn't really have much of a response, just packed up my kids and drove her to the ER. She's completely fine, just a little shaken up, and very afraid of water. \n\nAnyway, my sister text me and told me I ought to thank him for saving her life. I didn't respond initially because we were still in the ER, which led to her calling me an ungrateful bitch. Again, I ignored, because my daughter needed me, but last night everything came to a head.\n\nMy BIL dmed me asking if I would have rather she drowned. Following that I have recieved message after message. I tried to explain that I've been busy but my sister said not to contact them unless its to thank him and apologise. \n\nI will probably thank him just to keep the peace, but I think they're out of line. There was no need for his comment & their following behaviour. \n\nMy husband thinks I should go no contact but he's never liked them so I'm hesitant to listen. My dad agrees with hub, however.\n\nSo, AITA for not thanking him (yet)?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My neice and her cousins (on her mothers side) were left near the lake unattended ti play in the sand box and one of them unfortunately ended up going in the lake and drowning. She was 4. I remember my mom calling me and telling me that if i saw the news that just know it wasn't my neice.  That was 15 years ago and to this day it still haunts the person who found her.

I can\u2019t imagine saving my niece/nephew and then demanding a thank you??? Honestly I wouldn\u2019t ever expect one because that\u2019s just what I would do. No thank you necessary. \n\nYour cousin should absolutely know better than to take eyes off young kids around water. My daughter is four and can swim okay and my eyes are on her like a hawk when we\u2019re at the pool or beach. There are a lot of good ideas that your family should consider like having an official water watcher that rotates frequently like life guards do. \n\nIn hindsight you should\u2019ve taken your daughter with you obviously, but if I trusted my adult cousin who also has kids, I would\u2019ve done the same thing and left my daughter in her care while I tended to my toddler. Just last week I watched my best friend\u2019s baby in the pool while she went inside to get bottles. Could she have taken her daughter with her? Of course. But I was there and she knows how I am about water safety, so she knew her daughter was safe. \n\nI see she\u2019s on the waitlist for swim lessons, which is good. It\u2019s another hindsight thing. I would obviously start your toddler much sooner now that you\u2019ve experienced this, but even with solid swimming lessons, things can still happen, which is why supervision is so important!! \n\nI think your sister is absolutely an AH for texting you like that demanding a thank you. Seriously who does that?? While you\u2019re at the hospital?? Ugh. \n\nI\u2019m also extra concerned about who removed the life vest. Because of how my daughter\u2019s is, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to remove herself. If I saw it off, it would be so much more likely someone removed it. I honestly wouldn\u2019t trust any of the family again unless you can figure out who did that. I\u2019ve had family who thought I was being over cautious by putting a life vest on my daughter and would try to take her in the lake without it. Made me crazy. I never got a moment\u2019s rest our whole time there because I was always worrying about that even inside! \n\nSo I\u2019m going against the grain for not thanking him yet. NTA.

You are unreal.", "I gotta be honest, I think NTA. I think you should still thank your cousin for saving your child's life though, even though they were being shitty. My take on it is, they were overwhelmed by the almost drowning and their emotions got the better of them.\n\nThe way I understand it, you had to step out to care for a child and left someone EXPLICITLY in charge of your other child's care. They did what they were supposed to and took care of them. I don't understand why everyone is mad at you.

Also, the lifejacket had an additional fastener to keep her from sliding out the bottom, so that's not the culprit.\n\n4) your adult cousin had already watched your daughter once, and agreed to do so again so you could feed your son elsewhere. This is no different than asking a trusted adult to watch your child on the playground while you run to the bathroom or take a call. Or even leaving your child at daycare or a sitter - responsible adult is now overseeing child while you take care of something else.\n\n5) food and snacks were in a cooler next to cousin, not on a bench or table away from the kids.

This is not the action of someone thankful of being in the right place at the right time. This also isn't the reaction of someone tired of careless parents not watching their children. The behavior of someone with Hero Complex comes to mind though.\n\n8) you immediately rushed your daughter to the emergency room to ensure she wasn't hurt.

He probably was scared shitless and full of adrenaline from it.  If you did not respond much, he may have thought you were not understanding the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThe biggest thing I see here is that your sister and BIL keep messaging  and it keeps getting worse.

How can you justify allowing her into the water when she cannot swim and neither can you?

When used, it must be TIGHT against the user, unable to be lifted higher than the ears without literally lifting the person in it off of the ground. If you can lift it over a kid\u2019s head, they can drown without the jacket ever being removed, making it useless for saving a life, and very useful for finding a dead body. You also need three points of contact- chest is non negotiable, it must be padded here, not simply buckled or tied. The other two you need either both shoulders or both upper arms. I would personally never use one that wasn\u2019t a vest shape. Never use anything inflatable, if it pops you\u2019re on your own. When buying or renting/using free jackets, check for damage- broken or fraying straps/buckles, holes, etc. Never use a poorly fitted life jacket. Never leave a child (or anyone who cannot swim WELL) unattended with or without a life jacket. Never go in past your belly button if you aren\u2019t a strong swimmer; once your lungs enter the water you gain buoyancy and if you lose your balance, you may not be able to regain it.

I couldn't thank anyone till things cooled down and had time to respond to messages (two days later in each case), my brain was overwhelmed by the situation at first. Also my mother, before passing away, had several hospitalizations or entries to ER, and the people who texted me knew I might not be able to reply to their messages while in the hospital. So they just left me messages asking how everything was going, knowing I might not answer for a few hours, or perhaps until the next day.

They might have even gotten a thank you without even asking for it. But bombing her with messages, demands, and INSULTS, all while in the hospital, it's not something a mentally healthy person would do.

I\u2019m likely gonna get downvoted for this. These comments are insane. You left your child with a trusted adult family member, whose own daughter was playing with yours and almost drowned as well, after they agreed to watch your daughter. Your daughter had a life jacket on that she could not take off given the clips were in the back. You spoke to her about minding and being safe before going. You think your child is safe hands, she\u2019s got her safety gear on, and you go feed your other kiddo. You hear the commotion and go see your child being rescued. Her safety gear is somehow gone. Then the man who rescued your daughter, that has a history of being cruel to you, verbally attacks you for being a shit parent before you have a chance to even respond. You then take her straight to the ER. While you\u2019re *still* at the ER, these people begin to harass you by calling you names and demanding a \u201cThank you.\u201d All before your daughter is even in the clear, and you\u2019ve had a chance to process what the heck just happened. How tf are you getting voted an asshole? Not everyone is completely lucid and able to properly verbalize things when *they see their child almost drown due to a trusted individual\u2019s negligence*. Also, I\u2019d bet money BIL didn\u2019t tell the cousin what a shitty parent she was, yet she was the one watching the two kids and left them alone long enough for life jackets to be removed and the kids to run into the water. You did everything right and were verbally attacked before you were able to see if your child was okay or vocalize any thankfulness. \n\nInfantilizing the cousin as someone incapable of knowing whether or not she can watch a child, including her own, because she had a c-section is insulting. She knew she could; that\u2019s why she agreed. Acting as if you\u2019re this awful parent for not getting your child swimming lessons at age 4 is ridiculous as well. Faulting you for not taking her with you doesn\u2019t seem fair either. Parents can not realistically be with their child 24/7. You left her with a trusted adult so she could continue to play while you stepped away to do something. Every single parent has done this. NTA-and make it your damn life mission to figure out how the heck her life jacket was removed. That should be the biggest concern imo. Something seems fishy. I\u2019d send a thank you text expressing of course you\u2019re more than grateful/thankful, my gosh your daughter is alive, as well as stating you want LC/NC as you are tired of being harassed by this man and are appalled he used such a tragic occurrence to spew more toxicity your way before a word from you could be spoken.
