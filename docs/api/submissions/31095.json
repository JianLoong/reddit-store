This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement, with my aunt living in the house for free until she had enough money to find her own place while she\u2019d help my ageing grandma with whatever she needed. It turned out not to be so temporary.\n\nAt some point the gov made the \u201ccarer\u2019s payment\u201d which here means if you are caring for someone full-time and can\u2019t make a living as a result, you can receive money for support. But to lie about your income or time spend as a carer is fraud. For years aunt worked less, took less care of grandma and misused the payment. \n\nAbout a year ago in a text to my grandma she wrote she couldn\u2019t take care of her anymore, she\u2019s overwhelmed with all the responsibility and is moving in with her boyfriend. The only attempt she made to finding other arrangements for grandma was texting me, basically saying \u201cCould you take care of my dog my bf doesn\u2019t like him.\u201d\n\nIn the end I was the only other able and willing to step up and Grandma seemed so much happier for it which is the most important thing. I asked aunt months ago to take her name off the carers account before I\u2019d apply for it, which she said she did. Now taking care of my grandma full-time I applied with no success. Desperate I called the gov a few times until I to get in touch with a very nice lady who discovered I couldn\u2019t get the payment because someone was already receiving it. In my shocked I had to ask, \u201caunt was the last carer, but she said she cancelled it ages ago. Are you sure she\u2019s actually receiving the payment?\u201d\n\nShe sounded as shocked as I did \u201cNo, the recipient is receiving the money. When did she last take on the care taking role?\u201d\n\nNow furious, I told the lady \u201cshe hasn\u2019t lived in the house for the better part of a year.\u201d The \u201coh gosh\u201d that I heard is still clear in my head even now. We both realised at that moment that my aunt had committed a felony. The lady thanked me, reassured me they\u2019d handle the situation and that I didn\u2019t have to do anything in the mean time.\n\nI calmed down and did some research where I learned aunt would either have to pay a years worth of the money back, which would be at least $18,000 or face jail. I now feel awful. She\u2019s depressed, her kids does talk to her, her bf is in and out of hospital and this could also impact my grandma\u2019s health if one of her daughters went to prison or came begging for money.\n\nMost family say she made her own bed, but some said I probably should have been more tactful and not told the lady the whole story, since before the called they could only prove the fraud went on for the last few months, which would have meant less debt.

At age 50, her selfishness and greed are simply catching up with her. Not your fault she took so long to learn the hard way.", "NTA.  Sounds like your aunt was committing tax fraud and preventing you from receiving the payments you should have been getting.\n\nThe person in the wrong here is your aunt.   She's now facing the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA- your aunt was lying to the government, taking money she wasn\u2019t entitled to, ignoring your grandmother\u2019s needs and denying you the rightful payment as carer\u2026 why would you be the AH?", "NTA\n\nAnd as far i understand it, you even did her a favour.

(It would have still affected her taxes is the only problem with this idea).  Because sometimes dealing with the government is a headache trying to get started on anything is a pain in the ass....... but she didn't..   she pocketed the money..\n\nYour aunt fucked around and found out.

Knowingly continuing to recieve it is deliberate fraud.  Even if she had notified them and they accidentally kept paying she would have noticed the payments to her.\n\nYou have taken on the responsibility of looking after you gran and can't work, but did she expect you to have no income when you were looking after your gran?  She knows how much work that is because she herself said that she was overwhelmed with the responsibility.\n\nOne worry is if she had access to any of your grans finances that she may be tempted to dip into those to bail herself out.

This happens pretty consistently in humans and you always have to keep your reason sharp to determine how true it is.", "NTA she broke the law and has to face the consequences", "NTA Your aunt felt no guilt to abandoning your grandma", "NTA primarily because it doesn't seem like you had any intention of genuinely throwing her under the bus. It seems like you were calling with what you though was a government issue and you found out you had a sketchy criminal aunt cheating the government issue and the information provided was you trying to make sense of this wild turn of events. \n\nNot saying you would be the asshole if it was more intentional, but it seems like something that just came out of real confusion as to how she has been collecting when she said she cancelled it so you could collect and was no longer doing the work.\n\nIf anybody \"calls you out\" for it, well she did have it coming. I wouldn't feel too bad at all.", "NTA. She knew exactly what she was doing when she lied to you. Also, you didn't tell on her out of malice. You needed financial assistance, and you had to go deeper to see why you couldn't receive it. It's not your fault your aunt lied.", "NTA. You can't & shouldn't lie to the government; that just creates more problems for yourself. Your aunt committed a felony. She's a greedy jerk who fucked herself over; it's her own fault. I feel bad for your grandma, but her daughter is a grown woman who knows what she did is wrong & needs to be taught a lesson, just like the rest of us.", "NTA.  \n\nYour aunt committed a felony and took money that was supposed to go towards the cost of your grandmother's upkeep.  She stole from your grandmother for ages, and then she stole from both of you when you took on an actual carer role.\n\nYour aunt is guilty of elder abuse.  That is your grandmother's house, and the credit is for her benefit.\n\nShe deserves everything she gets.", "Your aunt knew the consequences of defrauding the government and chose to do it anyway. You really didn't have much to do with it and still don't. You applied for the benefit and told the truth. If you had lied that would have made you complicit. The bottom line is your grandmother is being taken care of by you in a loving manner. Don't put guilt on yourself that you don't need or deserve.", "NTA.

Good for you to step up to look after your grandmother.", "NTA, your aunt is taking the money but abandoned her mother, your grandmother.", "I one had a fight with an auto insurance board about the findings of an accident that held me responsible - when it was the other guy's fault (really!)\n\nI had to go to the state capital for a scheduled meeting and present my case as to why it wasn't me. I described the scene and the accident - luckily one of the board members had worked there and knew of the odd way the road was laid out. They read the other driver's account of the accident towards the end of the meeting and I blurted out, \"But, he's LYING!\" It was an entirely kneejerk reaction.

You took your aunt at her word, and she lied. You didn't turn her in, you didn't *know.* I'm sorry, but she deserves every bit of the trouble coming her way.", "Because she'd be out of the 'free' money she was recieving for 'caring' for grandma.", "No, I doubt she didn\u2019t know what she was doing, in fact I bet she was banking on the fact that no one would push the government to find out why no one else could claim it AND that if / when she was busted that the family members would ignore her wrongdoing\u2026", "She ignored and deserted grandma and dumped her dog for her boyfriend.
