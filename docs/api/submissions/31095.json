This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement, with my aunt living in the house for free until she had enough money to find her own place while she\u2019d help my ageing grandma with whatever she needed. It turned out not to be so temporary.\n\nAt some point the gov made the \u201ccarer\u2019s payment\u201d which here means if you are caring for someone full-time and can\u2019t make a living as a result, you can receive money for support. But to lie about your income or time spend as a carer is fraud. For years aunt worked less, took less care of grandma and misused the payment. \n\nAbout a year ago in a text to my grandma she wrote she couldn\u2019t take care of her anymore, she\u2019s overwhelmed with all the responsibility and is moving in with her boyfriend. The only attempt she made to finding other arrangements for grandma was texting me, basically saying \u201cCould you take care of my dog my bf doesn\u2019t like him.\u201d\n\nIn the end I was the only other able and willing to step up and Grandma seemed so much happier for it which is the most important thing. I asked aunt months ago to take her name off the carers account before I\u2019d apply for it, which she said she did. Now taking care of my grandma full-time I applied with no success. Desperate I called the gov a few times until I to get in touch with a very nice lady who discovered I couldn\u2019t get the payment because someone was already receiving it. In my shocked I had to ask, \u201caunt was the last carer, but she said she cancelled it ages ago. Are you sure she\u2019s actually receiving the payment?\u201d\n\nShe sounded as shocked as I did \u201cNo, the recipient is receiving the money. When did she last take on the care taking role?\u201d\n\nNow furious, I told the lady \u201cshe hasn\u2019t lived in the house for the better part of a year.\u201d The \u201coh gosh\u201d that I heard is still clear in my head even now. We both realised at that moment that my aunt had committed a felony. The lady thanked me, reassured me they\u2019d handle the situation and that I didn\u2019t have to do anything in the mean time.\n\nI calmed down and did some research where I learned aunt would either have to pay a years worth of the money back, which would be at least $18,000 or face jail. I now feel awful. She\u2019s depressed, her kids does talk to her, her bf is in and out of hospital and this could also impact my grandma\u2019s health if one of her daughters went to prison or came begging for money.\n\nMost family say she made her own bed, but some said I probably should have been more tactful and not told the lady the whole story, since before the called they could only prove the fraud went on for the last few months, which would have meant less debt.

This happens pretty consistently in humans and you always have to keep your reason sharp to determine how true it is.", "NTA she broke the law and has to face the consequences", "NTA Your aunt felt no guilt to abandoning your grandma", "NTA primarily because it doesn't seem like you had any intention of genuinely throwing her under the bus. It seems like you were calling with what you though was a government issue and you found out you had a sketchy criminal aunt cheating the government issue and the information provided was you trying to make sense of this wild turn of events. \n\nNot saying you would be the asshole if it was more intentional, but it seems like something that just came out of real confusion as to how she has been collecting when she said she cancelled it so you could collect and was no longer doing the work.\n\nIf anybody \"calls you out\" for it, well she did have it coming. I wouldn't feel too bad at all.", "NTA. She knew exactly what she was doing when she lied to you. Also, you didn't tell on her out of malice. You needed financial assistance, and you had to go deeper to see why you couldn't receive it. It's not your fault your aunt lied.", "NTA. You can't & shouldn't lie to the government; that just creates more problems for yourself. Your aunt committed a felony. She's a greedy jerk who fucked herself over; it's her own fault.

She stole from your grandmother for ages, and then she stole from both of you when you took on an actual carer role.\n\nYour aunt is guilty of elder abuse.  That is your grandmother's house, and the credit is for her benefit.\n\nShe deserves everything she gets.", "Your aunt knew the consequences of defrauding the government and chose to do it anyway. You really didn't have much to do with it and still don't. You applied for the benefit and told the truth. If you had lied that would have made you complicit.

In fact, she lied and said she had stopped getting it.\n\nSorry, but in what world would you be the asshole here? Also, I wouldn't worry about it so much. It takes a lot more for the government to be able to convict someone for defrauding them.

I\u2019m the carer for my elderly dad and get the carer payment from the govt. When I first applied his dr assured me I *would\u2019t* get it at least on first application. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because he was hopeless at filling out the form and not putting in any detail. I did get it. And I earn it. \n\nAt first he was still pretty independent, but he can\u2019t cook or clean. Can\u2019t walk far or stand for long periods. He\u2019s had numerous falls and  been in hospital a few times where I was sure this was the beginning of the end. But he\u2019s chugging along. Since the start of covid in 2020, I\u2019ve been out socially a grand total of 7 times. My life has been put on hold. But I\u2019ll do it for my dad. There\u2019s a whole lot of issues surrounding my siblings not helping but we\u2019re working on that. \n\nIt\u2019s people like your selfish aunt that makes it harder for people to get the payment, or other government payments as so often we\u2019re dubbed as \u2018dole bludgers\u2019 and scamming the government. Im not sure if you\u2019re in Australia, but the consequences of the Robodebt scandal [the govt agency for payments,Centrelink, initiated an automated system to claw back apparent \u201coverpayments\u201d made to welfare recipients] showed the system was massively flawed, most of the original payments were correct and people shouldn\u2019t have been penalised. People lost houses, relationships and sadly, lives. Innocent people were targeted, yet people like your aunt were falsely claiming the money and getting away with it. \n\nFrom one carer to another, thank you for looking after your grandmother. You\u2019re the only family member who stepped up to take over the responsibility of your grandmother, so the other family members who said you should have been \u201ctactful\u201d can keep their opinions to themselves.

I like to think we\u2019re both pretty lucky to have people in our lives we care about this much :)", "Wouldn\u2019t she have to keep documenting her hours to keep getting paid? So this was not just a lie of omission. Not that it\u2019s defensible either to claim that you didn\u2019t notice thousands of dollars going into your bank account but explicitly filling out hours that you didn\u2019t complete is clearly her fault. The consequences are her own"]}
