It's your phone and you have the right to delete all of the pics as you please. But you could've deleted the pictures after you airdropped everything.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.\n\nThousands of pics, no, no way you need to keep all that.  You've still got hundreds per your post, you're 100% remembering the party, this is just someone being weird.", "Nta. \n\nI wonder if Hannah herself accidentally deleted the photo and was really banking on you having it. Bit of a weird thing to be hung up on imo, but I'm an entirely different demographic ig...\n\nPlus...agreed. who needs that many photos? You were there, you experienced it, you had a good time. How often *really* is it expected that anyone's going to be dedicating time to looking through even *hundreds* of photos? \n\nIf it was going to be documented in 4k from twenty different angles why even bother going when it can be relieved in its entirety later? \n\nIt's a waste of space. If they want to get hung up on it, well, maybe that explains why you were the only friend from highschool who went. Friend sounds vapid and shallow. \n\nShe wasn't paying you to be a photographer lmao. That's not why you went.", "Info - If all the photos were airdropped to everyone, then someone else must have the photo in question, correct? \n\nOr did you take photos and then delete them all before the air drop?", "NTA. How self centered are Darla and Hannah. If someone I met and hung out with for only one weekend deleted a pic of me from their phone, I would think nothing of it. Likewise, if - after sharing all photos and videos with the group - my best friend deleted hundreds of photos, I would not care at all. \n\nThey have the photo, what does it matter if you do or not? Is Darla always this unreasonable?\n\n(Random aside: I've only known one Darla in my life and she was definitely this unreasonable and selfish. I'm assuming you used fake names but you picked a good one for your friend.)", "NTA. You hit a nerve.", "NTA. You should let someone know in the moment if you want a cool picture of yourself sent over if you knew it existed.", "NTA", "There\u2019s a recently deleted album tho", "NTA. Darla is being unreasonable (maybe that's why none of her old friends showed up besides you?) in expecting every person to keep every photo of an event that's primarily important to her. She can save them all if she wants but she has no control over what others do with theirs.", "NTA-I don\u2019t even keep all the pictures for my daughter\u2019s events. During her volleyball games, take pics of everything then delete 99% of them later. Why would you keep pictures of random people?", "Darla had it on her phone from the air drop and was able to send it to Hannah.", "Darla is mad I didn\u2019t keep all of her bachelorette pictures \u201cfor the memories\u201d", "Yes. And I air dropped it to everyone. Hannah couldn\u2019t find it on her phone. Darla was able to send it to her since she had it from the air drop.", "I did. Hannah just couldn\u2019t find it for some reason. She was able to get the photo from Darla who had it from the air drop.", "I just don\u2019t get why Darla thinks I would want to keep a bunch of selfies of people I don\u2019t really know.", "I\u2019m sorry, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear in the post. I did air drop them. Hannah was able to get the photo from Darla.", "Right?!?", "They were all air dropped. Hannah was able to get the photo from Darla.", "I air dropped it to her before deleting it.", "That's what I meant when I referred to how she's acting.  This is immature and weird.", "Oh well then NTA. I don\u2019t see what the issue is really even in that case. Your photos especially after sharing are your prerogative.", "NTA, there\u2019s no reason to be keeping photos that are on the cloud.", "She shouldn't. To me, she's being unreasonable. I deleted pictures from my bff's wedding. She knows I did it, cause I did a massive photo dump to her phone before. There is no reason for her to expect it. You gave her the pictures.", "Oh, my bad. MOST DEFINITELY NTA then.", "You should make this clear in your OP. Seems like a lot of people are assuming you deleted photos before sending them out to everyone. Which is not the issue here.", "Then definitely NTA. I figured her issue was that she didn't get the photo. But if her issue is soley with the fact that you cleaned up your photo library.. then shes being ridiculous.", "That\u2019s what I thought. But she is placing a lot of importance on them, and while they are important to her because she knows those people, I don\u2019t think they have to be important to me. I have a picture of her and I in front of the fountain, I don\u2019t need one of her other friend too to cherish the memories.", "Thank you for the suggestion, I added the clarification.", "It\u2019s more Darla who thinks I\u2019m the AH for not saving all her bachelorette photos.", "Yeah.. Thats just silly.", "It seemed obvious to me that no one would want to keep a bunch of selfies of people they don\u2019t really know, but she seems to feel like because they\u2019re form her bachelorette that they are more important.", "Yeah. Its pretty self-absorbed. Obviously you kept the photos important to you. Which is already probably too many to ever do anything meaningful with lol. We have such an overload of photos nowadays."]}
