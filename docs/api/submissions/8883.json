I asked Charlie to do the normal things that shouldn\u2019t have to be asked, clean up the house, take care of the kids. I get home at 8pm, Rangers crying, Ana\u2019s trying to feed him cheezits, the house is a mess, toys, food, everywhere. Rangers in a full diaper. Ana tells me they haven\u2019t eaten dinner. I go in my bedroom to find Charlie sleeping. I wake him up and he tells me he was sorry he wasn\u2019t feeling good, I told him when he\u2019s a parent it doesn\u2019t matter how he feels he has kids to take care of. We got in a big argument, I told him if he was that sick he should\u2019ve went to urgent care and called someone for the kids. He didn\u2019t see any problem with his behavior. \n\nAs I start making dinner, not even getting a chance to change out of my scrubs, he decided he was going to go out for a cigarette, not even help me pick up. I was so mad I locked both doors. Once he realized he started banging on the door, he eventually called his mom to come get him.\n\nHe texted me calling me an AH and how I\u2019m a nurse but didn\u2019t care that he was sick. His mom has also been sending me rude text.

This dude is totally self-absorbed to the point of endangering your children.  If you don't act to protect your children, there is the possibility that you could lose them. Courts take into account the mother's actions (or non-actions) when these kinds of things come to light.", "NTA.

He can't have been that sick if he felt like going out to buy cigarettes.", "You\u2019re a nurse. His needs must come first if he isn\u2019t feeling well.

Why are you with this person? He neglected his kids and something bad could have happened. I was a single mother for two years with no family nearby. When I got sick, I managed.

I know plenty of women who have been sick and say, 'this needs doing and that needs doing' and the guy says, 'don't worry, you can leave it until you are feeling better,' with a reassuring smile on his face.", "NTA.  He left your young children unsupervised.  You can\u2019t go take a nap when you\u2019re the only adult present, even if you don\u2019t feel well.  You power through it and take care of the kids.", "NTA.  You actually have THREE children.", "Those poor babies. I can't imagine finding my kids in that level of neglect.

BF seriously needs to grow up or you'd probably be better off without him. It scares me to think what kind of trouble a toddler and an autistic 6yo could get into unsupervised. You could have come home to a house fire or worse. Suppose your daughter has tried to feed your son a hot dog or some other choking hazard. What would have happened if daughter was playing and son got into the cleaning supplies? Your bf seems like he's more trouble than he's worth and your kids might someday pay the price for his lazy selfish behavior.", "NTA  \n\n\nhe should be going to urgent care if he is that sick now that someone is home to actually watch the kids, not trying to get back into the house", "NTA- a 6 year with SN and a 2 year old unattended?\nYou're lucky nothing bad happened. \nAnd if he's well enough to smoke, he's clearly well enough to least keep an eye on his kids.", "NTA and you are 100% right that no matter how you feel you are a parent first and your kids depend on you. \n\nIf he was so sick to not take care of the kids, he should be too sick to smoke as well but he seems to have done that just fine. He could have helped. \n\nEven if it was just taking care of the kids. Keep them clean and fed at the very least. House can come later but kids always need to come first. That I could understand. Fed and healthy kids but a dirty house. Fine. I don\u2019t like cleaning house when I am sick either. But he did nothing and left them unsupervised.

He seems to just be a parasite, and you probably would be better off without him... unless he does more than you've indicated here on Reddit.  You are not over-reacting at all. He needs to step up and actually be a father for his kids. If he isn't working, he needs to take care of the kids and do the chores.  NTA.", "NTA. Don't let him back in.", "ESH. You're right that he needed to be a parent even though he was ill.  But locking someone out of their own house is also childish. And you picked this guy and have been with him 8 years, suddenly you're shocked that he is like this?", "ESH\n\nYou for locking your boyfriend out of the house when he was sick. Him for neglecting the children without attempting to create a plan for their supervision.", "Locking him out is only acceptable if you mean him never to come back.  Which might be the right thing to do, but not something you should just decide spur of the moment.", "ESH. You're right, he's a selfish AH, a bad partner and a bad father. If you decided to break up with him I would be totally on your side. But unless he's being aggressive you can't just unilaterally kick him out of the house you both share.", "ESH. Good grief. You\u2019re correct, just because your sick doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect your parenting duties- although depending on how sick that may mean meeting the basic needs of the children and leaving the cleaning etc for later. But what kind of adult locks someone out of the house when they\u2019re angry? That is not an acceptable healthy reaction to be disappointed in your partner.", "ESH.\n\nYes, your BF is a major asshole. But do you really think locking him outside will have any sort of positive outcome in this situation? You're just making your own life harder.", "ESH\n\nYou've been with him for 8 years. You know how he is as a father, how much he contributes, etc.\n\nIf you had a problem with his parenting you should've brought it up to him. Maybe with a couples counselor.\n\nAs it stands, this is abuse.", "ESH he should have called someone in to watch the kids if he was feeling so ill but what you did was out of line as well. Yall both need to do better", "ESH.

It's hard to stay involved with people who make such stupid decisions, especially when they involve your kids.\n\nIt's unwise to suggest divorce because I don't know your circumstances. Regardless of what decision you make towards him he can't be trusted with the kids anymore. \n\nIf you do leave him with the kids again, get a camera and watch them from work.", "Nta. So happy you locked him out. If you\u2019re gonna do everything yourself why even have him there taking up space.", "ESH  Him for being lazy. you for being immature.", "I'll start by saying that he sucks for leaving the kids unattended and being unhelpful.\n\nI'll move on to say that it is never appropriate to lock someone out of their home unless they are causing an active danger to other inhabitants. He was not (his negligence was dangerous, but this danger was abated by the time you locked him out).\n\nESH.", "Both assholes. You don't lock someone out of their own house.", "Went out to have a cigarette lol \n\nNTA but you have bigger issues than you think. I\u2019m sorry\u2026", "Nah you\u2019re right", "NTA. If he's well enough to keep smoking cigarettes. He can be a freaking parent too. Us moms are expected to still be moms sick or not.", "NTA. If you were home sick and he was working you\u2019d still have to take care of the kids. You don\u2019t get to call out from parenting, especially when you have young children.", "Where do you people find jewels like this guy?", "I'm going to go against the grain and say ESH.\n\nHe sucks more than you because he needed to suck it up and take care of his kids, but you also suck for locking him out of his own home. You should have been the adult and spoken with him (or broken up with him), not lock him out like he's a predator rather than just a lazy ass.", "People are saying NTA, which I agree with\u2014this was neglect and dangerous. He is an adult and being locked out of the house with his phone as an adult is likely not endangering him. \n\nBut I want to mention that between losing his job and having two young kids, he might be depressed. Doesn\u2019t mean it is ok. I personally think his neglect is too dangerous to allow back into your life, but if he ever wants to be in his kids\u2019 life then he needs to apologize to you and seek therapy. Supervised visitation. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this.", "Yeah, the level of sick where it's understandable that you left your young kids unattended is \"unconscious/delirious/busy struggling to breathe or trying to control life-threatening bleeding.\" Basically, a level of sick where you should be in the hospital but you didn't have an opportunity to coordinate getting the kids somewhere safe and getting yourself there. Not \"under the weather and wanting a nap before you go outside to smoke.\"", "> Anything could have happened!\n\nI don't remember it, but my mom tells of a time when I was toddler aged: my dad fell asleep while she was out (this would have to have been sometime in 71 or 72).  I ate an ashtray's worth of cigarette butts.  Apparently I literally turned green.", "I feel like this kid\u2019s name IRL is absolutely Ranger", "But OP doesn't explain whether he was actually sick, or what type of sickness he might have had.  I have been in the position of trying to care for kids while sick.  It is not pleasant.", ">In Germany, we have a name for his condition: \"M\u00e4nnerschnupfen\". (Men's runny nose) \n\n\n\nYou guys have the perfect compound word for every situation \ud83d\ude04", "Locking him out makes it ESH. One can suck more than the other.", "It's also illegal.", "Im not excusing him, obviously, but legit, no matter how sick I am, I still smoke the same amount.", "Well he was still in the house.  Presumably the 6 year old could have jumped on him to wake him up.  but I'm not saying it is good.  Did OP try to find out what her husband was sick with before locking him out?  I know there was the odd time, when our kids were young, that I got some sort of throwing up illness and felt so bad I had to lie down. I remember my husband coming home to chaos.  This was in the days before cell phones, so I probably had no way of contacting him.   \n\nWas this behavior unusual for the husband?  Was he usually helpful around the house?  If it was just a one off, and he was usually helpful, then I think locking him out was a bit extreme.", "Poor you! That's so gross.", "I hope not", "When my son was 3, I was doing daycare for 3 other toddlers - my son was the oldest. One day they ALL had a stomach virus, and by the end of the day, I was throwing up, too. I can't tell you how much fun it was to change poopy diapers and clean up vomit while you're trying not to vomit yourself. But I did it, cuz that's what you do when you're talking care of children.", "Oh god forbid the man flu! Because that\u2019s worse than any illness you have, periods, menstrual pain, even giving birth, because they are dying and making damn sure you know about it.", "He told OP he didn't feel good. No other explanation then he didn't feel good. But felt good enough to smoke", "Then you call someone to come help you. You don\u2019t just leave kids unattended to take a nap.", "You're not wrong but we can tell from the post that OPs boyfriend was being irresponsible. It's not unusual to nap when your kids are napping but it doesn't apply in this case", "You absolutely cannot leave a two year old unattended while you nap.", "Understandable, but do you get up, go out and buy them when you're sick?  I don't smoke so I really don't get it. Is the addiction that bad in some?", "Me too, but I also take care of my dogs if my husband isn't around to do so.", "That's great and all but you don't do that unless you already fed your extremly young kids and changed them out of their full diaper. Otherwise, I see no point in letting you back into the house.", "And I said that. I said naps aren't inherently bad, but the timing of his was irresponsible and his parenting skills questionable.\n\nFolks don't like to read pass the first sentence I guess:\n\n\"That said, 2 hours is way too long, and sleeping just before dinner time is crazy - sometimes you need to power through.\r  \n\r  \nOP isn't an AH for being angry, but locking the doors isn't the way to handle things.\"", "I don\u2019t think he went to go buy them. OP said he went out for a cigarette. He\u2019s still an AH and OP did good.", "Yes.  And it\u2019s not just that bad \u201cin some\u201d.  I\u2019ve been pretty good about weaning down, max 3 a day at this point, and I\u2019d still go insane without them.\n\nI had a teacher that did heroin and cocaine too, said nicotine was harder to quit for her.  Don\u2019t start.", "Again, I\u2019m not excusing him, just saying that being sick usually won\u2019t slow down a smoker.", "I said I\u2019m not excusing him, I\u2019m just trying to respond to someone implying you\u2019ll smoke less when you\u2019re sick by saying \u201cno, I disagree\u201d.", "The downvotes are probably people disagreeing with your verdict, not that they didn't read your whole comment.", "Ah. I didn't read it that way but that sounds more likely."]}
