We have 2 kids together, a 6 year old Ana(she\u2019s autistic) and a 2 year old Ranger.\n\nCharlie recently lost his job, I work a full time job, I\u2019m a nurse. I asked Charlie to do the normal things that shouldn\u2019t have to be asked, clean up the house, take care of the kids. I get home at 8pm, Rangers crying, Ana\u2019s trying to feed him cheezits, the house is a mess, toys, food, everywhere. Rangers in a full diaper. Ana tells me they haven\u2019t eaten dinner. I go in my bedroom to find Charlie sleeping. I wake him up and he tells me he was sorry he wasn\u2019t feeling good, I told him when he\u2019s a parent it doesn\u2019t matter how he feels he has kids to take care of. We got in a big argument, I told him if he was that sick he should\u2019ve went to urgent care and called someone for the kids. He didn\u2019t see any problem with his behavior. \n\nAs I start making dinner, not even getting a chance to change out of my scrubs, he decided he was going to go out for a cigarette, not even help me pick up. I was so mad I locked both doors. Once he realized he started banging on the door, he eventually called his mom to come get him.\n\nHe texted me calling me an AH and how I\u2019m a nurse but didn\u2019t care that he was sick. His mom has also been sending me rude text.

That's straight up neglect.  Anything could have happened!\n\nAnd he's well enough to go out for cigarettes?? Wow.\n\nYou are NOT overreacting.  This dude is totally self-absorbed to the point of endangering your children.  If you don't act to protect your children, there is the possibility that you could lose them. Courts take into account the mother's actions (or non-actions) when these kinds of things come to light.", "NTA.  If he could call his mother to pick him up, he could have called her to help with the kids earlier, right?  That was a dangerous situation and you\u2019re lucky the kids are ok.", "NTA.  Move him out.  Sounds like you've been rethinking this relationship for awhile.  \n\nHe could have called his mother then gone to an urgent care.  He doesn't get a pass just like sick mothers don't get a pass.", "NTA\n\nI would have been furious as well. In Germany, we have a name for his condition: \"M\u00e4nnerschnupfen\". (Men's runny nose) Basically, a man that is barely sick but acts like he is about to die...", "NTA. Dump him.", "Yes, OP, you need to seriously re-think this boyfriend of 8 long years. I'm getting the feeling this was not the first he's shown his true colors as a parent and a partner. NTA.", "Wait, he was too sick to keep an eye on his children but not too sick to run out for cigarettes? \n\nNTA. Tell his mom her son is a buffoon. And change the locks while you're at it.", "Honestly... NTA.\n\nMaybe locking him out wasn't right... but damn. Is your boyfriend usually a negligent parent? He can't have been that sick if he felt like going out to buy cigarettes.", "You\u2019re a nurse. His needs must come first if he isn\u2019t feeling well. The absolute least you could do is recognize that and send his useless butt to stay with his mommy! \n\nNTA!!!", "NTA. What kind of pitiful excuse for a parent goes to sleep and leaves their 2 and 6 year olds to fend for themselves?\n\nIf I'm sick, I'm totally letting tidying the house go - the house can be a mess for a few days until I'm well again - and the kids would find themselves watching a lot more videos than they usually do, but they're going to get fed, and the baby's diaper is going to get changed, and they're going to get put to bed.", "NTA. \"I\u2019m rethinking this whole relationship\" yes! Why are you with this person? He neglected his kids and something bad could have happened. I was a single mother for two years with no family nearby. When I got sick, I managed. If he's well enough to smoke, he's well enough to get off his arse and parent his kids.", "NTA it amazes me how no matter how sick a woman is, even after major surgery, a woman is still expected to care for kids and clean up, whereas all these guys cannot do anything for the slightest pretext. I know plenty of women who have been sick and say, 'this needs doing and that needs doing' and the guy says, 'don't worry, you can leave it until you are feeling better,' with a reassuring smile on his face.", "NTA.  He left your young children unsupervised.  You can\u2019t go take a nap when you\u2019re the only adult present, even if you don\u2019t feel well.  You power through it and take care of the kids.", "NTA.  You actually have THREE children.", "Those poor babies. I can't imagine finding my kids in that level of neglect. Given their ages him sleeping while they are awake is really dangerous. What if your daughter had decided to try and cook dinner? Absolutely NTA and you shouldn't take him back.", "He neglected two tiny children, abusers like this get no sympathy from me. NTA. If he\u2019s so incompetent when it comes to taking care of himself and the kids then maybe he should just stay with his mom.", "NTA. It sounds to me like you don't have two kids, you have three. BF seriously needs to grow up or you'd probably be better off without him. It scares me to think what kind of trouble a toddler and an autistic 6yo could get into unsupervised. You could have come home to a house fire or worse. Suppose your daughter has tried to feed your son a hot dog or some other choking hazard. What would have happened if daughter was playing and son got into the cleaning supplies? Your bf seems like he's more trouble than he's worth and your kids might someday pay the price for his lazy selfish behavior.", "NTA  \n\n\nhe should be going to urgent care if he is that sick now that someone is home to actually watch the kids, not trying to get back into the house", "NTA- a 6 year with SN and a 2 year old unattended?\nYou're lucky nothing bad happened. \nAnd if he's well enough to smoke, he's clearly well enough to least keep an eye on his kids.", "NTA and you are 100% right that no matter how you feel you are a parent first and your kids depend on you. \n\nIf he was so sick to not take care of the kids, he should be too sick to smoke as well but he seems to have done that just fine. He could have helped. \n\nEven if it was just taking care of the kids. Keep them clean and fed at the very least. House can come later but kids always need to come first. That I could understand. Fed and healthy kids but a dirty house. Fine. I don\u2019t like cleaning house when I am sick either. But he did nothing and left them unsupervised. Fuck that guy.", "Hopefully his mom can finish raising him and one day he\u2019ll be a man.  NTA", "Sick mothers have always had to still take care of their children.  If the mother is too sick to do so... they're probably in the hospital.\n\nFathers have gotten away with slacking off for far too long (I am a guy,btw.)  You seem to effectively be a single parent... your bf doesn't work, doesn't cook, doesn't clean, doesn't take care of your kids.  What does he do? He seems to just be a parasite, and you probably would be better off without him... unless he does more than you've indicated here on Reddit.  You are not over-reacting at all. He needs to step up and actually be a father for his kids. If he isn't working, he needs to take care of the kids and do the chores.  NTA.", "NTA. Don't let him back in.", "ESH. You're right that he needed to be a parent even though he was ill.  But locking someone out of their own house is also childish. And you picked this guy and have been with him 8 years, suddenly you're shocked that he is like this?", "ESH\n\nYou for locking your boyfriend out of the house when he was sick. Him for neglecting the children without attempting to create a plan for their supervision.", "Locking him out is only acceptable if you mean him never to come back.  Which might be the right thing to do, but not something you should just decide spur of the moment.", "ESH. You're right, he's a selfish AH, a bad partner and a bad father. If you decided to break up with him I would be totally on your side. But unless he's being aggressive you can't just unilaterally kick him out of the house you both share.", "ESH. Good grief. You\u2019re correct, just because your sick doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect your parenting duties- although depending on how sick that may mean meeting the basic needs of the children and leaving the cleaning etc for later. But what kind of adult locks someone out of the house when they\u2019re angry? That is not an acceptable healthy reaction to be disappointed in your partner.", "ESH.\n\nYes, your BF is a major asshole. But do you really think locking him outside will have any sort of positive outcome in this situation? You're just making your own life harder.", "ESH\n\nYou've been with him for 8 years. You know how he is as a father, how much he contributes, etc.\n\nIf you had a problem with his parenting you should've brought it up to him. Maybe with a couples counselor.\n\nAs it stands, this is abuse.", "ESH he should have called someone in to watch the kids if he was feeling so ill but what you did was out of line as well. Yall both need to do better", "ESH. I am 100% seeing why you did this and why you are upset, but locking him out so that he has to have his mother come get him was not the right move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a feeling this is one of those \u201cstraw that broke the camels back\u201d situations. I was a single mom for a long time. No one to help when I was sick. I still managed to do the bare minimum of feeding my child and being attentive. Why couldn\u2019t he have done sandwiches or something silly for dinner, or even ordered delivery food, and throw on a movie so he could \u201crest\u201d while also still being there to be present for the children? There are so many options that do not include no dinner and sleeping away from the kids in the bedroom. Heck- he could\u2019ve brought them in to hang in bed with him! I even had to do that a few times! Lol. The very absolute minimum you have to do as a parent is feed the kids and keep them alive. He failed to do one of those, and thank goodness he didn\u2019t fail at the other with his inattentiveness.", "He's TA for how he acted throughout the tale you're telling.\n\nI really hope the kid named ranger is a fake name.

I think it's that the AH went into another room and left your 2yo with your 6yo to rest, when it seems to you that all he ever does is rest.   You're a nurse so you know that sometimes depression can hide itself well.   Haul is ass into therapy STAT, you'll want factual data for your relationship rethought.   Maybe he needs ADHD meds, maybe he needs a kick in the pants, maybe a kick out the door.", "NTA. I've been extremely ill and still managed to care for my kid.

My pulse went up just thinking about what could have happened (what if baby choked on crackers, for instance). You're NTA at all and I'm glad you're rethinking things because this is NUTS. Completely unacceptable. \n\nBeing a parent means breaking your limits to take care of your children. He was too sick to FEED AND CHANGE A 2YO but not too sick to go out for a smoke??????", "NTA.

If you can't do it you need to get someone who can. And him thinking he did nothing wrong by neglecting the kids? That makes it even worse!\n\nThat being said, unless you fear for the safety of you or your kids, locking him out without warning is a terrible way to kick him out. Kicking him out for the night though? Sounds justified.", "NTA", "ESH \n\nYes, you overreacted by locking him out and not letting him back in. I understand your frustration, but that was over the top. \n\nAnd clearly you are rethinking your relationship if you can\u2019t be bothered to ask him what was wrong, how he was sick. So why don\u2019t you go ahead and end it?\n\nHe sucks because apparently he isn\u2019t pulling his weight even though he\u2019s currently a SAH parent. \n\nBut in this single incident, if he is truly ill, then a bit of compassion would have helped. Should he have gone to UC? Maybe. But can you/he afford it? Especially since he isn\u2019t working? Was it possible for someone to come take care of the kids while he went, or while he slept? Was there anyone available? Would you have allowed MIL in the house if she\u2019d been available?\n\nThere are many things left uncovered by your post OP.\n\nAgain, I get it.
