I follow a lot of people on YouTube, but there are super famous youtubers who get name dropped to me I've never heard of. Online followings, even the biggest ones, are pretty niche, and the therapist STILL probably wouldn't assume he's the same person even if she recognized the name. And if she DID professional behavior dictates that couldn't influence anything.\n\nI suspect BF is a walking red flag who doesn't want that to be pointed out.", "NTA, it's only his first name that is not something private, unless they go by a different name all together, In which case then you would discuss them by that name, but there is nothing private.\n\n *Specifically*, what is he scared about?? The therapist isn't going to do anything. \n\nIt almost seems like he's just starting a fight to start a fight, or is hiding something. It's just silly. Is he thinking that the therapist is a fae and going to steal his name?", "What is he in the fucking mafia? Thats the whole point of a therapist... lol", "NTA has your boyfriend ever heard of doctor patient confidentiality? His reaction is a red flag. What is he hiding?", "NTA You are going to have have conversations where you are most likely sobbing and no filters are going to be on, the therapist is going to be confused if you have used nothing but pseudonyms till that point.", "Red flag! Red flag!!", "In therapy it\u2019s very common for patients to use actual names when talking about people in their lives. For many, the conversation flows easier that way. I\u2019ve had patients who have used both first and last names, in some cases naming friends or family who are famous/very-well known.\n\nYour therapy is about YOU. You are not breaching his privacy. You can say whatever you want about anyone that you know. Names & details remain confidential.\n\nNTA. At all.", "NTA. I\u2019m confused by his logic here. Therapists legally can not disclose information learned in sessions unless your a danger to yourself or others. Does he have something to hide? His reaction is a little alarming.", "\"Jonah\"", "My narcissistic ex used to hate that I talked about him in therapy. He used to say that therapists are fake and I shouldn\u2019t let a \u201cstranger\u201d tell me what to think.\n\nEdit: I forgot a judgement. NTA of course. Fuck your bf.", "NTA.  You could give the therapist his name, social security number, phone number, driver's license number, etc. and it would never get out of that office.  Anything you say to a medical professional is confidential (Unless they get any indications you intend to harm yourself or harm someone else, in which case they're obligated to report it).  If they were to divulge it to anyone they could lose their license for ethical violations.", "My therapist knows my husband's name. Not only is he on my emergency contact list, but I talk about him regularly. He's part of my life. \n\nIt's your therapist, not his, it's unlikely she cares about him at all beyond how it impacts you.", "I guarantee I won\u2019t know an influencer if I had them arrested for slapping me in the face.", "SO def has main character syndrome. Online following isn't helping.", "No, that\u2019s too common a name to be worried about other people hearing it.", "I really appreciate your well-rounded view of this! That\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s worried about, except we\u2019re in a massive city and my therapist is in a city that\u2019s about an hour away.", "I told him myself because I am trying to convince him of how helpful therapy can be (he\u2019s almost convinced to go!), but he knows I\u2019m not going to tell him everything, and is okay with that.", "My therapist asked what his name was, and when she heard it, she told me it reminded her of a similar name in her native language. I hadn\u2019t ever heard it before and thought it was cool, so I told him about it.\n\nOther than that, I shared some things I learned because I want to convince him of how helpful therapy can be, because he\u2019s on the fence but interested. I\u2019m not sharing everything by any means, and he is understanding of that, at least.", "Thank you for accepting the feedback! \n\nI understand that point, and I understand his. It\u2019s complicated. Might be worth an apology and explanation, this shouldn\u2019t be something that you guys get stuck on for too long.", "Glad he didn't push for the info\n\nBut still, sorry he freaked out to you over something really minor\n\nThe therapist likely gave 0 fucks and it's just helpful to be able to refer to him faster\n\nInstead of 'my boyfriend' this and 'my boyfriend' that you can just say 'Maximilian' this and 'Maximilian' that \n\nEdit: tried picking a fake that is a lil unique-ish haha", "Sadly, some therapists are criminals. Your father dated one:\n\n\"A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of the Privacy Rule may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm.\"\n\nI can't judge everyone by the worst of humanity.", "Source please?\n\n  \nAlso\n> where the psychological practitioner does not require a license  \n\nYea sure, if you tell your secrets to your shaman or the fortune teller, they are not obliged to laws for therapists... what do you mean?", "As an attorney you're only required to report criminal activity if the lawyer was involved like preparing documents for what you later learn is a fraudulent transaction.", "Yeah the main issue I\u2019m having is that he didn\u2019t express beforehand that I was supposed to keep his name confidential, and he knew I was going to go to therapy. He was even encouraging of it. He said it was common sense so I should have known not to say it. I can see why he\u2019d be uncomfortable because he has an incredibly unique name, but at the same time, yeah, I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s common sense to withhold his first name, especially since the therapist would lose their license if they blabbed.", "Source from Google on American association https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/03/cover-abroad#:~:text=And%20many%20developing%20countries%2C%20including,or%20regulation%20of%20clinical%20psychology. You can find it in the text in the middle. \n\nIn my country (not US), we don't call them therapists. We have:\n- psychiatrists (doctors who need to comply with medical law) do not provide therapy\u2014but deal with mental illnesses that require hospitalization. \n- clinical psycho-therapist (not sure how to translate it) are also doctors who practice in mental hospitals and usually do not provide therapy. But deal with mental illnesses that do not require hospitalization. \n- and psychologists or psychological practitioners (more of a direct translation) do not require a medical degree, but they can have a degree from several taps of college. This last type provides counseling and therapy. They are not licensed. They more or less work on reputation. You can make a contract to state secrecy. And probably sue them in a worst-case scenario. But you can't forbid them from future practice.", "Sorry, i didn't mean to imply that you were saying she was. I was just saying that, for some people, it's more difficult to avoid saying names and just meant that I, personally, don't think it makes her an asshole.", "Thats not true. Those are situations where a lawyer can report those things without breaching confidentialoty but you're not reauired to do so."]}
