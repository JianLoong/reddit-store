Is he aware that therapists can lose their license if they disclose any information that their clients told them?", "NTA. I've never heard of not telling your therapist the name of those near and dear to you. It's not common sense to not disclose. The point of therapy is to have honest and open dialogue, lying about something as simple as a name isn't a good way to start therapy.", "NTA. Therapy is for you and confidential medical info. His insecurity is honestly weird and irrelevant to your needs.", "NTA\n\nBut I also would very very strongly caution against telling your boyfriend what you talk about in therapy, **especially** if this is his reaction about such a minor thing. What happens there is for YOU and none of his business.", "That sounds like your SO has something to hide. You're talking to your therapist who has to adhere to confidentiality. You're not name dropping your SO all over social media.", "NTA did he explain why that is a bad thing? It\u2019s completely normal to tell your therapist names of people in your life. this is a weird thing to be mad about\u2026", "NTA I highly doubt your therapist plans on stalking his social media. I bet my therapist has never even googled me and I'm a patient. Your therapist's office isn't Reddit lol.", "NTA. Absolutely nothing wrong with what you\u2019ve done, it seems odd to me that this would even be an issue. Everything you say to your therapist is confidential, what does he thing they\u2019re actually going to do with this information?\n\nWhat you talk about with your therapist is private, and in future I wouldn\u2019t tell you\u2019re boyfriend what you\u2019ve spoken about with them.", "NTA, I don't see how disclosing just the first name is doing harm to him. Especially when it is to a medical professional that has strict confidentiality measures to follow.", "NTA.\n\nHis expectations are ridiculous. You didn't breach his privacy. The bad judgment call here was not sharing his first name with the therapist.", "NTA. \n\nI guess your BF has done some terrible things to you and he knows it. Why else would he be bothered if your therapist knows his name?", "Nta. For example, if you had several sisters, it\u2019s much less complicated (and rather inconsequential for all involved) to refer to them by their names. Otherwise you\u2019d constantly be saying \u201cmy older sister,\u201d \u201cmy youngest sister,\u201d \u201cmy second youngest sister,\u201d etc. I don\u2019t understand how his privacy has been breached, especially with just a first name..? Plus, therapists are typically bound by patient confidentiality policies anyway.", "NTA - tell your therapist whatever you want. You can tell them his last name if you wish, the therapist can't tell anyone anyway.", "NTA. It\u2019s therapy not Reddit", "NTA. My therapist knows the name of my boyfriend, several exes, guys I dating. She\u2019s not looking them up, it just helps to talk about the things going on in my life.", "Well, well, well, hasn't someone got an inflated sense of his own importance.\n\nIt might be worth pointing out to your boyfriend that a) your therapist is bound by confidentiality to not discuss anything that you tell them and b) most likely doesn't give a shit about your boyfriend's online \"fame\".\n\nNTA", "NTA, you can say whatever you want in therapy, that's what it's there for. Also, therapist are bound by confidentiallity, so this is not an issue, you could tell them his full name and it still wouldn't matter.\n\nBoyfriend seems to have an overinflated ego from this \"online presence\", he needs to chill out.\n\nIf he keeps calling your therapy sessions a bad judgement call, he's an issue.", "NTA.\nIs he aware that therapists never give their patients information outside their room?!", "LMAO!  He thinks he is way more important than he is.  It\u2019s not an issue to a normal person, but to a person with a hyper inflated ego it might be.  These are the red flags we talk about here that scream, RUN!  Don\u2019t walk, run away from this loser.   No normal person would have an issue with this and this is just the start of accommodating an egomaniac.", "NTA. You need to be able to talk about everything with your therapist, especially your significant other.", "They don't care and probably won't remember.", "NTA\nWhat does he think your therapist will do with his name? Info is missing but this sounds like he's been treating you poorly for him to even react that way.\nI've been going to therapy for 7 years, I've had partners with me, I sat next to my partner when he had therapy sessions via video call, and so on.\nTherapy should be embraced by both parties in a relationship. It's to help you, not to frame him, usually. \nI think this is actually a red flag.", "I assure you, your therapist does not give a flying duck about your boyfriend\u2019s social media presence. NTA", "NTA - therapist here, we're bound by confidently. All my clients have shared their parents name, along with theirs friends, sibling, coworkers ect.  Honestly we don't care if our clients loved ones are famous it generally has little bearing on the therapeutic relationship and progress. I'm also going to assume that even though his name is unique he's not the only individual with the name in the world. \n\nThe only time knowing someone's name that isn't a client can impact my work is if I include it in my notes because of the laws of my country.  If I mention by name anyone in my notes and they request a copy for court documents I have to provide them.  An easy way to get around that though is to refer to the connection they have to clients instead of names, for example clients partner or clients friend ect.  Obviously names are included if it's safeguarding issues but I have a separate form for those incidents to protect client notes.", "NTA.\n\nUnless you're under some sort of NDA -- which would be a completely different kettle of fish entirely, and why would anyone do that in a relationship haha! -- your therapist, if they're worth the money you/someone pays for and ethical, will keep things in confidence.\n\nIf your therapist doesn't know you, your situation, how can they provide adequate care for you?\n\nYour boyfriend having a big online presence shouldn't matter, apart from how that affects you and your therapy. If he's got nothing bad to hide, what difference does it make to him? That also goes for what is discussed between your therapist and you. It's your therapy.", "NTA - why wouldn't you name names to your therapist - unique or not? That is a weird thing to get upset about.", "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have given out my name. You know I\u2019m a big deal online and your therapist no doubt knows who I am.\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.\n\nYour therapist is legally bound to protect your confidentiality, so there isn't a concern here for your BF's privacy.  I do think it's quite odd that your BF is so upset about it, though.  What is the *real* reason he's so upset about it?", "NTA, he sounds like he has main character syndrome. Your therapist sees and hear about enough people that she won\u2019t care about him.\n\nI\u2019m a doctor and whilst I\u2019m mildly entertained when I see a famous/ semi famous person, I\u2019m much more interested in people I know in person but don\u2019t do anything with either information, both due to the law/Hippocratic oath and lack of energy to cyberstalk people.", "NTA. seems like an innocent slip", "ESH If you are in therapy to get healthy, dropping this guy is probably your first step.\n\nPlease stop discussing your therapy sessions to him.

Like, do your friends and your family know whom you're dating, including his first and last name? This smells very bad, and not because you're T A.

Why did you need to tell his previous name to your therapist? Do you have an issue with said name?  Couldn't you just said that your bf changed his name? Do you know what his name change is all about? \n\nI have a previous name (pre transition) and I usually don't tell it, and I would only tell it to people I'm close with, and I trust them to not share it around. I don't want strangers knowing it. It's related to a time in my life I'm not comfortable with, and isn't really part of me right now.

Fr tho therapist can't just go around telling patients info", "NTA!! It\u2019s not as if your therapist is gonna tell the whole world because obviously she can\u2019t and also I don\u2019t even think your therapist cares about the online fame he has or whatever the case is.", "NTA\n\nIs no one here aware of doctor - client confidentiality here?", "Info. Why did she even need to know his name? She\u2019s there for therapy not him? That doesn\u2019t really seem necessary to me.", "NTA. I have seen 5 different therapists at different parts of my life and in different states over the past 20 years. I have always referred to my significant others by their first names, and no one ever said that this was not standard protocol. If it\u2019s common knowledge not to use a first name I\u2019ve never heard of it! \n\nI think your BF is uncomfortable and maybe you should talk about why and find a different resolution instead of him putting this on you, that is not right. \n\nLike many others have said, therapists in the US (I can\u2019t personally speak to other countries but I think it\u2019s pretty common) are bound by confidentiality rules that can only be breached in very specific circumstances, and that is taken seriously since it\u2019s an important part of therapy.", "Nta\nWhy you telling your bf what you do in therapy?", "Your therapist is bound by confidentiality laws. *You* are not.

It's literally like going to the doctor, a therapist needs context.", "It actually depends on the country.", "it's common for therapists to get bombarded with names. everyone talks about parents, step-parents, spouses, kids, step kids, neighbours, coworkers, friends, exes and ex-friends. Shit gets confusing", "Well she's not exactly my therapist, but my psychiatrists nurse who I go talk to 1-2 times a month and she doesn't know anyone's names. I'm not hiding their names, but it just feels more comfortable to leave the names out. I also think it's less confusing because if I say \"my brother\" she knows exactly who I'm talking about, but if I say \"Jack\" she needs to remember if Jack is my brother, cousin, friend, nephew or ex.", "I mean if it is a very unique name, and she is telling the therapist immensely private details about the bf, I could see his point.\n\n\nBut only if the name really is that unique, and he has online presence.", "My first thought as well", "This. The only concern he could possibly have is if he has /is behaving in ways that could lead to the therapist reporting him for something.

Wow. As if this bf thinks he\u2019s well known? Also, the fact he\u2019s upset about it\u2026seems like he knows if he\u2019s being mentioned it\u2019s not because he\u2019s a nice guy?", "Not completely true, I remember all the names of the important people in my active clients life.  However, you're right in that we don't care other than the relation to our clients.", "Or boyfriend. Good therapist is much harder to find than egotistical boys with inflated egos.", "Sorry but where does it say it's a previous name? It only says 'first name', as in OP didn't give the therapist his last name, only first one. As in 'Mark said' instead of 'my bf said'. There is nothing here about transition?", "Also the point is that a therapist knows their client so unless they're hiding their relationship or she is somehow going their anonymously herself, the therapist could find out his name anyway. \n\nLike if someone gets to know me they'll find out who I'm married to sooner or later because that's a public fact...", "Would be pretty dumb then to use his real name for his online presence, wouldn't it? Everybody who knows him can tell whatever they want to whoever they want about him - nothing he can do about it.", "Yeah, that's probably the more likely reason he's pissed off. He knows he's not being presented in a good light to the therapist.", "Oh, I read first as \"the one he was born with\". Otherwise it makes zero sense. I couldn't event fathom it. Disregard my comment.\n\n\n\nI would say in my defense I'm not a native English speaker, and in my native language \"first name\" does mean the name you had first (before you changed it\". We use \"private name \" to refer to one's name."]}
