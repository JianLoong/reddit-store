If you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck and the extra spending actually puts you in a difficult position, then you\u2019re right to be upset.

When you go grocery shopping does your girlfriend buy things that maybe she just tolerates for you?  Maybe a particular brand of toilet paper, a particular food she doesn\u2019t eat but knows you like?   Next question, will you get any benefits from the items she bought, will at any point in time will you eat the extra food she bought or drink the booze?    And does she never help pay for your shaving cream, razors, deodorant, hair stuff for you?  I mean why can\u2019t you help cover that cost?", "Edited to YTA after info received ( see thread of comments below for reasoning)\n\nWhat extra items did she buy?

I've been in a relationship where that was happening (genders reversed) and it was SO hard. I mean, yeah, I also wanted to buy nice stuff, but we needed to keep money for bills!\n\nI wonder if there was a dynamic at play with shopping with her mum and wanting to not look penny-pinching or absentmindedly sliding into child-at-home mode. It's normal for standard of living to dive when you move out from parents, cos they're 20-30 years older, richer, more established. And you can't afford to buy what was normal to buy in the family home.\n\nI'd wait until tempers have calmed down then genuinely try to find out why she went so far over the budget you both agreed to and the list you made. With compassion. If there was some sensible future buying (eg 2kg rice is cheaper long run than 500g) then that can count against part of your future food budget, but I think you're right not to pay otherwise.

This is just being a decent person.\n\nLike I said in another comment, if this was an issue with you struggling for every dollar, than that SHOULD have been a conversation about budgets and making that she does what she can to stick within the budget. But that's not how you approached of discussed this with her.", "Ikr? OP sound insufferable. I can't imagine living with a partner like that.", ">I think you believe your statement is true.\n\nSo but you know my relationship better than me then?", "If she wants to but extra alcohol, skincare, and things that are for just herself and not both of them, she should cover the extras that she wanted and did not check with OP that he was okay paying for. She went $50 over budget for her wants and not for household needs. They buy toiletries separately normally as they use different products and don\u2019t share. They normally buy foods each person wants individually separately. Why should OP pay for what they didn\u2019t agree to pay for? They share joint expenses for joint groceries, not joint expenses for $50 extra of things only one partner wants. In their relationship, things that only one partner wants are paid for by the person who wants them. \n\nAgain, explain how wanting to follow the agreement they had regarding joint expenses versus personal expenses is controlling.", ">But how is it YOUR money\n\nWhose money do you think she's asking for when she want 50% of the cost?", "This. I buy things for my boyfriend all the time and he does it for me. This is how we balance it, but we also just don\u2019t care. We discuss where we are at and if I\u2019m having a rough week, he picks up more. If he\u2019s having a rough week, I pick up more. And OP uses toiletries too. He best not touch that alcohol or that food if he\u2019s going to be like this. \n\nOP, separate your finances if you\u2019re going to be like this. It was one time and this behavior clearly shows you\u2019re not ready for a relationship. Nothing will ever be black and white or 50/50 exactly. It\u2019s 100/100, where both are giving their all. With every new day, giving it your all will look different. Sometimes it means 70/30. Where you may be the 70 some days and others 30.", ">It\u2019s stingy because it\u2019s still being used by the household.\n\nIf I buy myself new clothes, should my girlfriend pay half?", ">Yes, they can be a bit more expensive, but she deems them necessary\n\nWe don't buy our skincare products in the shared grocery shop.\n\n\"You seem very fixated on things she buys \"that \\[you\\] won't be using\". Sounds a bit selfish to me?\" It's selfish to not want to paty for things I don't use? Is it not selfish to use someone elses money for your own things?", "I would actually rather live alone than having a spouse micromanaging me. \nIt\u2019s killing relationships.", ">'d rather starve than have someone micromanaging my food shop like that\n\nYou'd rather starve than not be able to spend your partners money without their permission?", "Ah yes because the only solution is to take everything too far. Most people would talk things through before acting like you", "Can't actually answer the question then?", "Still ignoring the post then. So you think it's completely fine to spend money that isn't yours then?", ">some toiletries which are a needed thing\n\nHer toiletries so why should I be buying them? She doesn't pay towards mine when I get them because its not a shared item.\n\n\"This is just being a decent person.\" You can be a decent person without letting people spend your money for you.", "So you are saying, you don\u2019t make any compromises in your relationship?", "So she\u2019s spent her OWN money and she\u2019s requesting you give her half of what she\u2019s spent? \n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned twice now, open a joint account and put the money in there. Once it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone.", "Depends on how you guys pool your money and what you guys deem a household expense. Lots of couples absolutely would include that, and it would just come out of their shared funds. Everyone can structure their finances in a way that works best for their relationship. It can be all in, it can be only groceries, it can be completely separate with no money mingling at all, etc, etc.\n\nEveryone in that relationship has to be on the same page about it though. The two of you are not on the same page about it. So again, completely separate your finances because you aren\u2019t willing to have any flexibility regarding it.", "You're surely aware you're being disingenuous now. The whataboutism of your responses are defensive, and this surely can't be the hill you want to die on with a partner you've only recently started living with.\n\nCooperation and compromise, with communication. YTA, OP.", "OP- you and the girlfriend apparently need a serious discussion here because you two are defining \u201cgroceries\u201d differently. Obviously you guys are serious enough to be living together so this discussion really should have happened before now.\n\nMy husband and I (sorta) ran into this when we started budgeting. I consider \u201cgroceries\u201d to be pretty much anything you can get at the grocery store- so yes including alcohol and toiletries- while he considers \u201cgroceries\u201d to be food and alcohol but toiletries to be household goods. We talked, adjusted, and all is good.\n\nShould she have sprung the extra expense on you? No way. Not in the age of cell phones. But you also sound damn near like you want to see the receipt to pick and choose what gets split and that\u2019s not okay either.\n\nESH", "You live together. Presumably you CHOSE to do that? Presumably this is a choice to share your life and home with her? If any of these assumptions are wrong, please correct me.\n\nAs I said in another comment, compromise, cooperation and communication are all essential. If you don't understand that, you are nowhere near mature / unselfish enough to be living with a partner.", "I'd rather starve than have some bean counting loser freaking out because I bought some fucking supermarket moisturiser. I hope your girlfriend seperates her food shop from yours so she can eat what she wants and you can cook your own value range mince and rice.", "Oh dear god, your gf deserves better. It\u2019s not really taking it too far considering your responses. You want to pay for only what you use in a partnership, that\u2019s not how that works. It\u2019s a team effort and the only thing you care about, through your post and responses, is yourself. If she was your roommate, I\u2019d have more of an understanding, but I\u2019ve also purchased meat as a vegetarian for my roommate and never thought to ask him for that money specifically as we just split the bill. Didn\u2019t matter if I use it or not, what benefits him benefits me as we agreed to work as a team because it\u2019s tough out here. Your reaction and expectations aren\u2019t that of a teammate.", "How old are you? How old is she?", "My man hands me his debit card and tells me to go to town. I never go overboard though. This happens at least once every few months, and we're not rich. I do the same for him occasionally too. \n\nWe're partners. We have our accounts and one shared account. \n\nSo yes. If I'm put in charge of something I'm going to execute it as I see fit cause I'm there making the decisions. \n\nI highly suggest you revisit your relationship with money and with your gf. If you can't tolerate a one off overspending here and there and expects her to live like a miser like you, you're gonna be broken up with sooner than later. \n\nShe bought it out of the pot because she thinks \"we\", not \"me\", and it was for the both of you. \n\nYou keep thinking \"me\" and not \"we\". Until you realize that you're gonna have a hard time. You can't even accept the YTAs you're getting. It's not like she spent $400 on frivolity, she was trying to do something kind for her partner. She's 100% in this as \"we\". You're still stuck at \"me, my, mine\".", "This little birdie's blinded by what happened with their ex. As long as you're protesting the use of *your* 50%, then you can ignore this person's projecting of their experience on you. I like how they also hopped on their high horse saying you've been *'weighed and found wanting'*, Poor deluded thing. No judgement from me since I'm just enjoying the circus.", ">Her toiletries so why should I be buying them? She doesn't pay towards mine when I get them because its not a shared item.\n\nMate, you have a hell of a lot of growing up to do.", "This isn't about the whole relationship though. I never said I don't make compromises at all but the rest of the relationship is irrelevant to the post", "Most people arent just opening joint accounts with boyfriends", ">You're surely aware you're being disingenuous now\n\nNo I'm not.
