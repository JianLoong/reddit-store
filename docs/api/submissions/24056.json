She can't literally interview for him.", "Something tells me he won\u2019t be very effective at a job, given how many people he needs to support him right now.", "He does blue collar maintenance work, which takes a big toll on him physically and mentally. There\u2019s always demand, but I\u2019ll admit, part of having him be stay at home was because he hated doing it (as would I, tbh).", "We\u2019ve tried multiple male counselors and they have all said that his capacity for stress is much more limited than mine. That it\u2019s ok for him to require more help with this stuff. I think I\u2019ve tried to be ok with it for a long time but it\u2019s so much more difficult when he flat out denies that he gets more free/down time than myself or other working parents. I would rather he work and be paid if he feels like what he does at home is no different than that.", "I\u2019ve been asked that before.

I actually *want* him to have more responsibility to plan and run things, but find things slip through the cracks, or he\u2019ll say he\u2019ll just do them tomorrow (but forget). We agreed that I\u2019ll write things down for him, so he doesn\u2019t have to think of it on his own.

Because of this dynamic, intimacy has actually declined substantially. Im definitely not hanging around just for the sex (or lack thereof).", "I apologise if I  come off as rude, but if that's you being fair then it's pretty pathetic. The man is a stay at home parent who does nothing to manage his household, and the amount of hours he puts into parenting a week could barely be considered part-time work. You're essentially co-parenting with your nanny. \nGive him the choice of either actually running the household day to day, in other words actually become a stay at home parent/spouse, or going back to work.", "True that. The guy seems to need help tying his own shoelaces.", "If he hates that, now the kids are older, he should go to trades school or college and pick up some skills. Part of the push back you\u2019re getting is likely because he didn\u2019t like his work.

Why do the counselors have to be male?", "Babe. It would literally be cheaper for you to get a divorce - you\u2019ve already coordinated and hired everyone who actually does the household work. Do you really need to subsidize his golf or hobby cars? You could spend that on a household manager who would take that mental load for you and actually put in the work to run your household!

He\u2019s just making more work for you.", "So the only things he's willing to think about and plan for are his own selfish whims and nothing that has to do with you, your household, or his own children?  Seriously?", "I thought having male counselors would resonate with him more, and I truly thought they would see what a ridiculous situation we are in. We had a female counselor a few years back and he just felt attacked.\n\nI assume these counselors are trained to sympathize, rather than give an objective opinion on the situation? Especially if it could ostracize their client?", "To be fair, he does have a task list that he will usually complete. But, yes, I believe compared to most people we both have it 100x easier. I just wish that he wouldn\u2019t act like he has no free time after all the help we\u2019ve hired.", "I\u2019ve clocked it, while taking care of two kids, it\u2019s 3 hours max. He gets substantial amount of time for breaks and time off, but somehow doesn\u2019t realize compared to working parents, he has a lot of free time. I\u2019m definitely the bad guy for giving him tasks and, now, suggesting he just get a job and we\u2019ll split the tasks evenly.", "He\u2019ll coordinate around some of the tasks, and to be fair, when things are running behind, sometimes he\u2019ll cancel. But I\u2019m told I need to write everything down and be clear so he can plan his day.", "I feel like they\u2019re telling you what he wants to hear so you\u2019ll keep coming back. Your husband has it good, I think you\u2019re right to ask him to get a job or at least acknowledge that you\u2019ve made it way easy for him. Most SAHP don\u2019t have as much free time as he has. His attitude is ridiculous", "I think it\u2019s telling that he felt attacked by the female counselor. Would it be because she held him accountable to his behaviors?", "I did feel like she held us both accountable, but in the end, he acted out much worse from those counseling sessions. I actually feel like he regressed because he just felt attacked. The feedback that I\u2019m getting from the male counselors is that I need to be more understanding that his tolerance is lower than mine for having to do multiple tasks.

And you have two jobs? \n\nWtf does that second parent do? \n\nHe\u2019s a stay at home golfer. NTA.", "Besides not contributing financially or doing a lot for the house is he a good husband?

He is not grasping that he is not getting joy out of fulfilling his role as a husband, human, and father. We are meant to find some satisfaction in doing what we are here and meant to do.

But it creates a person who relies on assistance for many tasks, even simple ones. Your husband has a tough case of learned helplessness since he is an adult and it\u2019ll be an incredible challenge to unlearn his helplessness. A therapist is probably needed, along with accountability and you\u2019ll probably have to treat him similar to a child unlearning a poor behavior. If he wants to go golfing, then he needs to do the yard work first. If he wants to work on his car, then the house needs to be vacuumed and mopped. It often takes a year or more of consistency and accountability for children to unlearn their helplessness, so don\u2019t be discouraged when his behaviors get worse before they get better.

It doesn't matter if he does more chores than you do, or if you have a nanny, what matters is that you are both getting what you need from the arrangement. If not, you are perfectly within your rights to try to negotiate an arrangement that does work for you. Just be prepared for the possibility that he may not be willing to step up and take on a true 50/50 partnership, when he is used to his current lifestyle.

He used to be emotionally supportive, now I think we\u2019re both just resentful.", "Actually, they are not.

So, though I expect him to do that for me every day because he loves to cook for me (especially because our food cultures are not exactly the same), I'll be damned if there's not at least a sandwich or a salad waiting for that man when he comes home from work. If you're wondering what this has anything to do with your situation, I just want you to see that your husband is doing less than a stay at home girlfriend who will only have to care about a 1 bedroom apartment and won't have to ever go to the market to shop coz they buy groceries online with no extra charge where he lives. You don't have 5-6 hours a day free when you have a part time job because of the commute and the getting ready part.\nSTAHP is actually a full time job and most of the time more than that. The reason why most people choose to have one of the partners out of the workforce is to not pay childcare, not to break their back to make the nanny rich (figuratively speaking)", "Edit: you have 3 children", "NTA.  This man sounds like dead weight in your life and a poor example for your kids.  I recommend the Fair Play book/cards by Eve Rodsky to help illustrate the very unbalanced division of labor.

Your Husband seems like a lazy, selfish, unappreciative, stubborn, whiney gaslighter. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m wondering what you see in a guy like him.", "Right now sweetie YTaA to yourself!! You are essentially paying and raising three kids, you don't need to have him as the adult third child. Please get rid of him, being a stay at home parent do not get a nanny for 4 days a week. My God what is gong on in that head of yours? Are you that afraid of being without a partner, get therapy and dump him please", "Why are you hanging around? He'd a third child. You're a single mom. He doesn't do anything. What on earth.", "They don't have to be around him to see that their mom does all the work and caters to a very lazy man. The gender dynamics you're modeling are very bad.", "The reason your relationship isn\u2019t a partnership is because he isn\u2019t remotely pulling his weight.", "My wife does the litter box, I do most of the rest of it (except we're past the diaper stage). The only thing that might make it take longer is the dishes, but even then, an hour is really stretching it. I do most of that like every other day or more, after I come home from my full time job."]}
