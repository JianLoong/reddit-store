She can't literally interview for him.", "Something tells me he won\u2019t be very effective at a job, given how many people he needs to support him right now.", "He does blue collar maintenance work, which takes a big toll on him physically and mentally. There\u2019s always demand, but I\u2019ll admit, part of having him be stay at home was because he hated doing it (as would I, tbh).", "We\u2019ve tried multiple male counselors and they have all said that his capacity for stress is much more limited than mine. That it\u2019s ok for him to require more help with this stuff. I think I\u2019ve tried to be ok with it for a long time but it\u2019s so much more difficult when he flat out denies that he gets more free/down time than myself or other working parents. I would rather he work and be paid if he feels like what he does at home is no different than that.", "I\u2019ve been asked that before.

I actually *want* him to have more responsibility to plan and run things, but find things slip through the cracks, or he\u2019ll say he\u2019ll just do them tomorrow (but forget). We agreed that I\u2019ll write things down for him, so he doesn\u2019t have to think of it on his own.

Because of this dynamic, intimacy has actually declined substantially. Im definitely not hanging around just for the sex (or lack thereof).", "I apologise if I  come off as rude, but if that's you being fair then it's pretty pathetic. The man is a stay at home parent who does nothing to manage his household, and the amount of hours he puts into parenting a week could barely be considered part-time work. You're essentially co-parenting with your nanny. \nGive him the choice of either actually running the household day to day, in other words actually become a stay at home parent/spouse, or going back to work.", "True that. The guy seems to need help tying his own shoelaces.", "If he hates that, now the kids are older, he should go to trades school or college and pick up some skills. Part of the push back you\u2019re getting is likely because he didn\u2019t like his work.

Why do the counselors have to be male?", "Babe. It would literally be cheaper for you to get a divorce - you\u2019ve already coordinated and hired everyone who actually does the household work. Do you really need to subsidize his golf or hobby cars? You could spend that on a household manager who would take that mental load for you and actually put in the work to run your household!

He\u2019s just making more work for you.", "So the only things he's willing to think about and plan for are his own selfish whims and nothing that has to do with you, your household, or his own children?  Seriously?", "I thought having male counselors would resonate with him more, and I truly thought they would see what a ridiculous situation we are in. We had a female counselor a few years back and he just felt attacked.\n\nI assume these counselors are trained to sympathize, rather than give an objective opinion on the situation? Especially if it could ostracize their client?", "To be fair, he does have a task list that he will usually complete. But, yes, I believe compared to most people we both have it 100x easier. I just wish that he wouldn\u2019t act like he has no free time after all the help we\u2019ve hired.", "I\u2019ve clocked it, while taking care of two kids, it\u2019s 3 hours max. He gets substantial amount of time for breaks and time off, but somehow doesn\u2019t realize compared to working parents, he has a lot of free time. I\u2019m definitely the bad guy for giving him tasks and, now, suggesting he just get a job and we\u2019ll split the tasks evenly.", "He\u2019ll coordinate around some of the tasks, and to be fair, when things are running behind, sometimes he\u2019ll cancel. But I\u2019m told I need to write everything down and be clear so he can plan his day.", "I feel like they\u2019re telling you what he wants to hear so you\u2019ll keep coming back. Your husband has it good, I think you\u2019re right to ask him to get a job or at least acknowledge that you\u2019ve made it way easy for him. Most SAHP don\u2019t have as much free time as he has. His attitude is ridiculous", "I think it\u2019s telling that he felt attacked by the female counselor. Would it be because she held him accountable to his behaviors?", "I did feel like she held us both accountable, but in the end, he acted out much worse from those counseling sessions. I actually feel like he regressed because he just felt attacked. The feedback that I\u2019m getting from the male counselors is that I need to be more understanding that his tolerance is lower than mine for having to do multiple tasks.

And you have two jobs? \n\nWtf does that second parent do? \n\nHe\u2019s a stay at home golfer. NTA.", "Besides not contributing financially or doing a lot for the house is he a good husband?

He is not grasping that he is not getting joy out of fulfilling his role as a husband, human, and father. We are meant to find some satisfaction in doing what we are here and meant to do.

I feel like he's knows you'll do whatever for the family and he's taking advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nWhat you should do if quit your part time job and lay off the nanny. That way he can actually take care of the kids which is the point of a stay at home parent. Then you will have more time to be at home with your kids since you won't be working 2 jobs. Seems the best compromise to me.", "A few things. \n\n1. He\u2019s not \u201cwatching\u201d his kids while you run errands. He\u2019s parenting them because HE IS A PARENT just like you! He doesn\u2019t get a pat on the back for the bare minimum. \n\n2. Taking the trash out and unloading / loading the dishwasher are basic household chores. If he has some physical limitations or disability that don\u2019t allow him to do yard work or cleaning I would understand but you said he golfs weekly\u2026so what exactly does he do all day long? \n\n3. He gets 5-6 hour breaks per day. When do you get a break? \n\nNTA. I would say you\u2019re a saint for supporting the family, cooking, cleaning, making his lists, parenting your kids and making sure he has \u201cdown time.\u201d", "YTA for letting an able bodied person -I assume- slowly deteriorate to the point that he whines about being a stay at home parent doing minimal work. I\u2019d divorce him.", "Not sure if YTA or not - but let him get a job and prove who's the AH here lol.  THis needs to be a reality TV show.", "Info: why is he staying home if you have a nanny, cleaner, gardener and pool cleaner? What else is there for him to do? In what way is he lessening your burdens or contributing to the relationship and family? \n\nAlso in my experience as a nanny kids can tell when their actual parent can\u2019t be bothered with them. The nanny watches the kids MORE than the \u201cstay at home parent\u201d does. That unfair to literally everyone involved, mostly you and your kids. It\u2019s a recommendation in childcare that time with the kids should be split 60/40 if possible with the parents spending more time with the children. So they can like bond with you and know you care about them. They\u2019re going to become more attached to someone you will eventually not need anymore than their father.", "So he\u2019s a stahd but doesn\u2019t stah with the kids? Make that make sense\u2026 NTA", "In education, we use the term \u201clearned helplessness\u201d for kids who have a low tolerance level for trying something out or putting in effort on a task knowing that they could make a mistake or fail. The \u201clearned\u201d part is that this behavior was enabled and reinforced by others, often adults and teachers themselves who are trying to help a student avoid these situations. But it creates a person who relies on assistance for many tasks, even simple ones. Your husband has a tough case of learned helplessness since he is an adult and it\u2019ll be an incredible challenge to unlearn his helplessness. A therapist is probably needed, along with accountability and you\u2019ll probably have to treat him similar to a child unlearning a poor behavior. If he wants to go golfing, then he needs to do the yard work first. If he wants to work on his car, then the house needs to be vacuumed and mopped. It often takes a year or more of consistency and accountability for children to unlearn their helplessness, so don\u2019t be discouraged when his behaviors get worse before they get better. Do this now so you and your kids aren\u2019t doing everything for him the rest of his life.", "My mom was a SAHM, so I view most things through that lens. She did almost everything, but my dad did watch us so she could have a break occasionally. When we hired all of the help, I thought that would eliminate his stress with the situation, but he seems to view things like he has it just as bad as my mom did. On top of it, he resents me asking for any additional help. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.", "Thanks for the honesty. Yes, this has been a concern for me. I keep thinking it\u2019s good because they have a father figure at home caring for them, but he\u2019s usually away from them anyways.", "He says he doesn\u2019t see the things that need to be done, so I do have to ask. When I\u2019ve asked in the past, he forgets, so the counselor said I should write it down for him. But he also can\u2019t handle things added last minute, so I try my best to give advance notice of a few days. This arrangement has been gradual and the result of our conversations with counselors.", "I actually wfh, so I can help out when needed, and I enjoy being able to be with the kids when I can. What I\u2019ve found is that my breaks and gaps, I\u2019m usually doing more housework and miscellaneous tasks (scheduling appts, etc). This is when I find him sitting around and get upset when he tells me he gets no breaks.", "His list is empty cat litter, do laundry (nanny folds and puts away), load/empty dishwasher, brush girls teeth, take diaper trash out, restock diapers and wipes, run sprinklers. He\u2019ll do miscellaneous things when needed, but these tasks never take more than 1-2 hours/day. For example, I\u2019ve asked for the pool to be topped off with the hose and a few plants watered outside this week.", "I make it a point to still do the kids doctors appointments, but he will get a few random things added to his list. But he complains considerably when these things happen, saying I\u2019m adding too much to his list, that he doesn\u2019t get time off as is. It\u2019s my reason for thinking he should just go back to work, so I don\u2019t have to be nagging for these other tasks to be done. It would be easier to just hire someone for the miscellaneous tasks who won\u2019t fight me and complain.", "Thanks for your response. To be honest, it was a slippery slope. We agreed to nanny help for just 2 days, which became 3 and then 4. We didn\u2019t have a house cleaner initially, but because I wanted the floors clean with two babies crawling, he told me if it was that important, do it myself. I didn\u2019t have time, so hired out.", "Not when you've outsourced the work to a nanny and a house cleaner.\n\nYou reverse the genders and the woman gets called a gold-digger with all that hired help.", "According to him, couldn\u2019t because he has too much on his list and is stressed with what he has.

I\u2019ve suggested depression, but he will not see a doctor for this and is 100% against any type of medication. I brought it up a month ago and he told me to drop it, or else I\u2019m trying to start a fight.", "I'd understand a babysitter for a couple of hours here and there, but this is a nearly full time nanny! Unless they're filthy rich, I don't get it.", "Yes. That really got me. Why tf is the one who works TWO jobs making the chore list??", "He 1000% sees the discrepancy. He doesn\u2019t care about the discrepancy. He\u2019s gaslighting you so he can continue to live a life of leisure on your dime.

I feel like even in those super rich families that have in-home nannies, chefs, etc., if there's a stay at home spouse they are at least the one in charge of managing the staff (plus normally do some sort of charity work or whatever that helps the family socially). This dude is contributing basically nothing.", "It makes me a bit sad to see that you are not only responsible for running the household and funding the household jobs that your husband for some reason doesn\u2019t do despite being a SAHO, you also think you are responsible for making him think this is all ok to begin with", "Op, you are getting played. Your husband barely does anything, what on earth dies he have to be stressed about?", "While I wouldn't be quite as harsh as the person you're responding to, it isn't a million miles away.\n\nAs an inherently lazy bloke myself, you're getting absolutely played. His refusal to countenance potential therapies or diagnoses for his 'fatigue' is pathetic. He has more free time than I do and I don't even have kids.\n\nAs others have pointed out, he's setting an absolutely atrocious example to your children. You need to be issuing ultimatums to him pronto. Stop being a bloody doormat, you're doing yourself down.", "I would love to be living his life tbqh. It sounds stress free and divine.", "This is insane and embarrassing.", "Congratulations op, you are a single parent with three children.", "Massive side eye to your counsellor. Their advice sounds more like advice on how to support a child with learning difficulties in the classroom not how to be a team as a couple!", "You have to realize that this is insane right?", "Op, what time do *you* get off?", "I think you know what you need to do for yourself and your kids but you're still afraid yet. Deep down you have to know you deserve better.", "No, HE should be cleaning the floors then.\n\nStop letting him get away with this BS.\n\nStick by your guns.\n\nYou don't need a nanny or at the very least cut back to her being there VERY part -time for only a few hours a day like 1 or 2 days a week.\n\nWhen I was a full-time SAHM of 2 kids I would have been so GRATEFUL just to have someone to do yard work, clean the pool ( if I had had one lol), and deep clean my house once a week! What a gift!\n\nAnd if I had someone babysit occasionally for a few hours here and there so I could run errands, go out, and have some alone time, I would have been beyond ecstatic!\n\nYour husband doesn't appreciate you or all the help he gets, and I suspect he knows he's taking advantage, but is counting on the fact that you don't want to confront him and fight about it, and he doesn't believe you'll really make him get a job.\n\nI know it can be easier to go with the flow and accept the status quo because you are a working mother with very young children; you're likely tired and overworked and don't want to rock the boat, but I think a serious talk with your husband is long overdue.\n\nPersonally, I think it should boil down to this: either he gets an actual paying job and you keep the nanny, or he truly becomes a SAHD and you let the nanny go, or at the very least, severely limit the time that she spends watching your kids and require your husband to actually be an equal co-parent and partner.\n\nIf you choose option B.) Give it a trial run and let him know that, then if it doesn't work out move to option A.)Get a job, because I suspect he'll act all 'overwhelmed' and your house will be a mess, chores won't be done, and dea hubby will claim that watching the kids on his own while keeping the house clean and doing daily chores is 'too much' for him.  He might use that weaponized incompetence to force your hand because you value a clean home and floors, and he doesn't. He knows you'll either take over and do everything for him or you'll hire help for him again. \n\nOn second thought, I think the only option is for him to work part-time and take on more of the child-rearing and household duties.", "So it definitely sounds more like a won't, and not can't.", "If they are the same age, sugar peer?", "Certainly sounds like she has 3 young children, not two.", "I mean he\u2019s already constantly whining and moaning about the tiny amount of chores he actually does. I think he is deliberately playing it up so that OP backs off while he spends all his time on his hobbies, possibly an affair.", "He could be there for the *Soylent Green* definition of \"Furniture.\"  lol", "Sugar sibling?", "We tried 3 different male counselors. When I laid out the situation for each of them, my husband contributed by saying he does a lot of the things around the house, despite the Gardner, pool person, nanny, and housecleaner. He does, in fact, do the majority of chores. I waited a few sessions each time for the counselors to come out with the fact that this is not an even partnership and none of them did. With this last one, I finally brought it up, asking if I\u2019m crazy and if this job split sounds ok to the counselor and the counselor kind of avoided making a call, just saying we both need to be more attentive to each others emotional and physical needs.", "So you\u2019re taking the full mental load of the household while he doesn\u2019t work. What, exactly, does he bring to the table? You\u2019d do better without him.", "I think it's unhealthy for him to stay at home anymore. He needs to have a job to go to. As it is, you are working 2 jobs and helping him when you are home, and also paying people to do the jobs at home most of us just do. It's not good for either of you. If he held down a job, you would both be on more equal footing.", "If he's so tired and overwhelmed all the time it's time for him to go to a doctor. Sleep apnea, depression, etc. It's not normal to feel like that all the time, especially when all the real stressors in his life (money, food, house management, childcare) are taken care of by you.", "All male counsellors. That is likely the reason none of them picked it up - like many men (particularly Gen X and older) have been indoctrinated to believe that \na) Doing chores from a list someone else creates is \"doing their bit around the house\" and\nb) Being a stay at home parent really isn't that difficult and is the same as 'not working'\n\nApart from anything else, if you're going to pay someone to do something around the house, surely it should be the other 'chores' he does, rather than the parenting? \n\nBottom line is that the current arrangement is not working for you. It doesn't matter if he does more chores than you do, or if you have a nanny, what matters is that you are both getting what you need from the arrangement. If not, you are perfectly within your rights to try to negotiate an arrangement that does work for you. Just be prepared for the possibility that he may not be willing to step up and take on a true 50/50 partnership, when he is used to his current lifestyle. But if you make it clear you are not willing to continue that, you may be able to make it work. Good luck!", "Is your husband opposed to female counselors?", "I\u2019ve tried letting him just run with things, and things were falling through the cracks, and I had to fix things, which is worse than just writing it down. The counselor recommended I write things down for him so he can get things done, as he doesn\u2019t see what needs to be done, or forgets if I ask in passing. He used to be emotionally supportive, now I think we\u2019re both just resentful.", "Actually, they are not. I finally came out and asked one of them if this situation seems normal and fair in his mind and he avoided the question, just emphasizing that we both should be considerate of each others needs. Maybe he thought the subtlety would work on my husband- but my husband just came away from the session thinking I need to be more understanding of him.", "I don\u2019t believe for a second he is tired like he claims. I have chronic fatigue myself and certainly don\u2019t have the energy for regular golfing or tooling around with a car. His life revolves around his hobbies and hanging out with his friends, if he was too tired to socialize I\u2019d take his complaint at face value. Right now if just sounds like he is manipulating OP into taking care of almost everything.", "Extra things would be like me asking him to water the outside plants for a few minutes, or turning on the hose to refill the pool water. If it\u2019s a longer task, I ask him if he can schedule it in for the week, sometime.", "Yes, it\u2019s true, monday-thursday we have the nanny, so most of the time he can do these tasks while not having to watch kids.", "Even this can be an argument- the fact that I book a restaurant, while he would prefer to go to Dave and Busters instead. Apparently, even in this, I\u2019m not being considerate of his feelings. It\u2019s very frustrating.", "This is actually a good point. Compared to a bachelor, I guess his life does look more difficult? Although most bachelors at least have something of a job..", "This is definitely a concern. He gets stressed and tired, and so the kids mainly get a lot of TV time when he watches them. I\u2019m trying to have someone around who is more interested in engaging with them.", "It used to be emotional security, and I loved just hanging out with him. But this failure to see what stress *I\u2019m* under in comparison is wild to me. And just compared to other stay at home parents- I\u2019m sure at least 90% of them do not have even just a nanny to assist. But for some reason, he fights me on this front, insisting he has it just as bad. I\u2019d prefer for him to just work then, if it\u2019s that stressful at home.", "> his tolerance is lower than mine for having to do multiple tasks.\n\nwhat??? most people are adults and are required to do multiple tasks even when it's tiring or uncomfortable.", "You need to get rid of the nanny. It\u2019s enabling. There is zero reason for you to be paying someone to watch the kids when you have a stay-at-home spouse.\n\nI am not trying to be mean but I am honestly baffled as to how you ever agreed to work two jobs and pay for childcare while your husband games and golfs and sits around all day. \n\nEither he watches the kids during the day or he gets a job and you guys pay for childcare. Generally I\u2019m all for compromise and positive communication but you need to make this a non-negotiable issue.", "If he\u2019s hanging out with bachelor friends and comparing his level of responsibility to their levels of responsibility, he\u2019s not going to factor in their jobs. He\u2019s going to look at all the stuff they get to do (and more importantly, all the stuff they *don\u2019t* do) in their free time. \n\nRight now, his options are between no job + housework and children, and job + housework and children. The housework and childcare duties don\u2019t disappear if he adds in a job.", "So what does he bring/contribute to your family?", "Probably because he\u2019s too lazy to organize that, too. OP would probably have to pre-arrange an affair for him.", "Yeah. The husband is clearly the asshole here, but I see zero to indicate affair rather than simply lazy.", "Thanks for this perspective! I have seen him grow. To be honest, sharing chores initially was very difficult, he felt everything had to be super fair. So, I\u2019ve seen progress, but I\u2019m getting very burnt out by waiting for any thing more, especially when he argues that he has it just as bad as anyone else. Then there\u2019s clearly no notification to take on more responsibility.", "But he barely does any housework or childcare! A bachelor who doesn\u2019t have a wife paying for a maid and a gardener and taking on all of the management and errands would have more chores to do that this guy!", "I\u2019m only able to understand your situation through the filter of what you share, but it sounds like he isn\u2019t doing remotely close to his \u201cfair share\u201d. If you really want to salvage the situation before you burn out I think you need to discuss with him that his task load and attitude about it are causing you burnout. Set some goals together for him taking on more of the house work so that you can pay less for these services and maybe go down to one job. He might want to resist this change because he will have more to do while you have less, but you\u2019re needs are not less important than his. You likely need less on your plate and he can very likely handle more. \n\nAlways remember that you are as valuable a person as your partner and you should be supporting one another. Express what support you need and start expecting it, change can take time but effort should be immediate.", "100% guaranteed that if Op divorces this deadweight, she will have more free time and he will have less.", "Correct - but a bachelor would have *zero* childcare, housework only when he feels like it, and zero obligation to consider anyone else\u2019s needs or schedules.", "She should divorce him than so he can live his dream. \nThe fact that she is working 2 jobs so he can game and play golf while whining the entire time is completely insane. He doesn\u2019t even have the kids a full day of Fridays, she says the babysitter comes at 3 and even on those days he just plops them in front of the tv. \nShe is setting a *terrible* example for her daughters with this set up."]}
