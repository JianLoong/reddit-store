I decided to hire help for the usual things (yard work, pool cleaning, weekly deep housecleaning), which were things he couldn\u2019t do, and it worked for a bit.

She can't literally interview for him.", "Something tells me he won\u2019t be very effective at a job, given how many people he needs to support him right now.", "He does blue collar maintenance work, which takes a big toll on him physically and mentally. There\u2019s always demand, but I\u2019ll admit, part of having him be stay at home was because he hated doing it (as would I, tbh).", "We\u2019ve tried multiple male counselors and they have all said that his capacity for stress is much more limited than mine. That it\u2019s ok for him to require more help with this stuff. I think I\u2019ve tried to be ok with it for a long time but it\u2019s so much more difficult when he flat out denies that he gets more free/down time than myself or other working parents. I would rather he work and be paid if he feels like what he does at home is no different than that.", "I\u2019ve been asked that before.

I actually *want* him to have more responsibility to plan and run things, but find things slip through the cracks, or he\u2019ll say he\u2019ll just do them tomorrow (but forget). We agreed that I\u2019ll write things down for him, so he doesn\u2019t have to think of it on his own.

Because of this dynamic, intimacy has actually declined substantially. Im definitely not hanging around just for the sex (or lack thereof).", "I apologise if I  come off as rude, but if that's you being fair then it's pretty pathetic. The man is a stay at home parent who does nothing to manage his household, and the amount of hours he puts into parenting a week could barely be considered part-time work. You're essentially co-parenting with your nanny. \nGive him the choice of either actually running the household day to day, in other words actually become a stay at home parent/spouse, or going back to work.", "True that. The guy seems to need help tying his own shoelaces.", "If he hates that, now the kids are older, he should go to trades school or college and pick up some skills. Part of the push back you\u2019re getting is likely because he didn\u2019t like his work.

Why do the counselors have to be male?", "Babe. It would literally be cheaper for you to get a divorce - you\u2019ve already coordinated and hired everyone who actually does the household work. Do you really need to subsidize his golf or hobby cars? You could spend that on a household manager who would take that mental load for you and actually put in the work to run your household!

He\u2019s just making more work for you.", "So the only things he's willing to think about and plan for are his own selfish whims and nothing that has to do with you, your household, or his own children?  Seriously?", "I thought having male counselors would resonate with him more, and I truly thought they would see what a ridiculous situation we are in. We had a female counselor a few years back and he just felt attacked.\n\nI assume these counselors are trained to sympathize, rather than give an objective opinion on the situation? Especially if it could ostracize their client?", "To be fair, he does have a task list that he will usually complete. But, yes, I believe compared to most people we both have it 100x easier. I just wish that he wouldn\u2019t act like he has no free time after all the help we\u2019ve hired.", "I\u2019ve clocked it, while taking care of two kids, it\u2019s 3 hours max. He gets substantial amount of time for breaks and time off, but somehow doesn\u2019t realize compared to working parents, he has a lot of free time. I\u2019m definitely the bad guy for giving him tasks and, now, suggesting he just get a job and we\u2019ll split the tasks evenly.", "He\u2019ll coordinate around some of the tasks, and to be fair, when things are running behind, sometimes he\u2019ll cancel. But I\u2019m told I need to write everything down and be clear so he can plan his day.", "I feel like they\u2019re telling you what he wants to hear so you\u2019ll keep coming back. Your husband has it good, I think you\u2019re right to ask him to get a job or at least acknowledge that you\u2019ve made it way easy for him. Most SAHP don\u2019t have as much free time as he has. His attitude is ridiculous", "I think it\u2019s telling that he felt attacked by the female counselor. Would it be because she held him accountable to his behaviors?", "I did feel like she held us both accountable, but in the end, he acted out much worse from those counseling sessions. I actually feel like he regressed because he just felt attacked. The feedback that I\u2019m getting from the male counselors is that I need to be more understanding that his tolerance is lower than mine for having to do multiple tasks.

And you have two jobs? \n\nWtf does that second parent do? \n\nHe\u2019s a stay at home golfer. NTA.", "Besides not contributing financially or doing a lot for the house is he a good husband?

He is not grasping that he is not getting joy out of fulfilling his role as a husband, human, and father. We are meant to find some satisfaction in doing what we are here and meant to do.

He might be hoping he will be stronger and be able to do what the nanny, the gardener, the cooks do... sounds like he also has trouble with work. Your man is depressed. This can eventually wear you the fuck out.", "If his condition is a real medical condition then I do feel bad for you. I feel bad for you either way. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s some WFH job he could take on that would be low stress enough for him. Data entry, call center, something simple. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to work two jobs.", "He actually is ok at work and gets hired pretty easily, but there are weird dynamics with anyone telling him what to do. I think this may play a role in our current relationship, as now I\u2019m the one more in the managerial role, unfortunately.", "This is very insightful. I have urged him to see a doctor, but he feels he isn\u2019t suffering from any medical condition, including depression. I\u2019ve broached the topic several times and he tells me to drop it or else I\u2019m starting a fight.\n\nI do think working would maybe bring some of this successful feeling back into his life, but he is adamant he doesn\u2019t want to go back to work, even as a trial run.", "He doesn\u2019t have anything formally diagnosed, but I have asked him to speak to a doctor, in case there is something they can help him with. He thinks it\u2019s normal the way he is feeling, though, so doesn\u2019t think he needs help in this respect.\n\nI can definitely bring up the wfh type job and see how he responds. Thank you.", "Mate - I\u2019d employ all those things so I had capacity to be more productive and effective - but that is not what he is doing!\nI also work really hard at myself, am on meds, and constantly working to be a better human and able to meet basics without falling over. He ain\u2019t even trying.\n\nI don\u2019t have any solutions for you - but I 100% validate your feelings that he is not taking on enough responsibility here.", "But he isn\u2019t taking care of the kids, you have a nanny?", "No, it isn't. I've got 2 kids. I could run through that list in an hour, while alone with the kids. He's got a nanny to look after the kids while he does them. He has more free time than probably 90% of people. PEOPLE. Not even parents.", "He \"regressed?\" He has \"low stress tolerance\"?  \n\nJeez, lady, do you have a husband or another child?  \n\nWhat adult activity does he agree to?  Sex? And I bet that's it!", "To be honest, the intimacy has gotten worse too. Most weeks he\u2019s just too tired, so we average maybe once a month.", "Why?  What is he contributing to the home? You are having to arrange everything for him except his play dates. If you have to have a full and a part time job just to support the household, why can\u2019t he be the one with at least a part time job? He has plenty of time to do it and the kids are already in daycare!   \n\nHe can\u2019t watch his own children while you are at work? He can\u2019t clean the house well enough so you don\u2019t need a housekeeper each week?   \n\nYou have one more kid than you think."]}
