We have two young kids together (both 2 years old). About 2 years ago, it was decided that he be a stay at home parent, while I work (1 full time and 1 part time job) as I bring in more income. My mother also lived with us at the time to help with the kids. I decided to hire help for the usual things (yard work, pool cleaning, weekly deep housecleaning), which were things he couldn\u2019t do, and it worked for a bit. When my mom decided it was time for her to move out of state with my dad, we decided to get a nanny for 36 hrs a week (Monday-Thursday, 8am-5pm) while my husband still stays at home. He\u2019ll do a lot of the chores from a list I\u2019ve premade (girls laundry, load and unload dishwasher, restock diapers, change diaper trash, take trash to curb) and watch the girls on Fridays until 3pm when we have a babysitter come for date night.\n\nEvery day, we wake up with the kids together, I\u2019ll change them and he\u2019ll warm up their milk. Then he\u2019ll take over for about 30 mins until the nanny comes. Once the nanny leaves at 5, we both feed them dinner and get them ready for bed.\n\nThe weekends are a bit different- while our morning routine is the same, I\u2019ll try to go back to sleep for another few hours while he watches them. We then both care for them for the remainder of the day, although sometimes I do need to finish a few additional work things. He\u2019ll also watch them if I need to run an errand or decide to get my hair or nails done for an hour or so.\n\nI\u2019ve given him full day breaks occasionally, and the household tasks take at most 2-3 hours/day, on top of watching the kids. There are sometimes other random things that need to get done, but I try to plan these out well in advance for him, and they never take the full day. I also do several household chores (laundry, cooking dinner).\n\nI calculate that he should have roughly 5-6 hours a day Monday-Thursday where he can take a break. And he does- he goes golfing at least once a week and works on an old car at least once a week, when he\u2019s not just playing his PlayStation.\n\nHere\u2019s where the argument came in- it\u2019s Sunday and after a difficult weekend for us both, I said to him, \u201cAt least tomorrow you\u2019ll be able to have a break.\u201d He replies, \u201cNo, you keep adding things to my list.\u201d \n\nAfter going back and forth a bit, I just said, \u201cOk, if you\u2019re telling me that your work at home (the daily chores) is just as difficult and time consuming as a regular job, then you should get a job and we\u2019ll split chores evenly.\u201d\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m being unfair and that I\u2019ll regret it because he does so much around the house. But I know what\u2019s involved (I made the list!) and if he is unappreciative of the down time he gets, then I see no incentive to keep the situation going.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: AITA for asking my husband to return to work since we have a nanny and he complains about having to do too many household chores?", "created_utc": 1691378929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15k93ym/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_get_a_job/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes you give him a full days break.... from literally what? He has seemingly 2/3rds of every day off. You give people a full days break from childcare because usually they are on all day every day for months or years on end, not because they have to let the nanny in every day.\n\nhe's saying you'll regret it so you don't go through with it because he doesn't want to leave his cushy stay at home and watch the nanny work job he currently struggles with every day.\n\nNTA.", "Right, isn\u2019t the point of a stay at home parent is to NOT have a nanny. OPs husband is far from what you\u2019d call a stay at home parent. He\u2019s more of a stay at home husband lol", "Yeah, he\u2019s not even writing the list", "To be fair, he does watch them Fridays and part time with me on the weekends. But, yes, I see the discrepancy. I wish he would.", "A nanny plus someone who handles all the mental load of household management (which is definitely something the SAH spouse should be in charge of).", "Can you imagine how much work OP will have to do to make that happen?  She can't literally interview for him.", "Something tells me he won\u2019t be very effective at a job, given how many people he needs to support him right now.", "He does blue collar maintenance work, which takes a big toll on him physically and mentally. There\u2019s always demand, but I\u2019ll admit, part of having him be stay at home was because he hated doing it (as would I, tbh).", "We\u2019ve tried multiple male counselors and they have all said that his capacity for stress is much more limited than mine. That it\u2019s ok for him to require more help with this stuff. I think I\u2019ve tried to be ok with it for a long time but it\u2019s so much more difficult when he flat out denies that he gets more free/down time than myself or other working parents. I would rather he work and be paid if he feels like what he does at home is no different than that.", "I\u2019ve been asked that before. When we got married, it was because I felt emotionally cared for, and I really valued that. It\u2019s becoming less and less so when I\u2019m told I expect too much from him and on short timelines.", "I do the financial planning, cooking, planning/packing for trips, feeding cat. We have a meal delivery service for the kids, where you only need to heat the food.\n\nThe list for him, verbatim, on the longest days is: change cat litter, empty diaper trash, load/empty dishwasher, run kids laundry (nanny folds and puts away), brush kids teeth, refill humidifier in kids room, run sprinklers. \n\nWe have a house cleaner who cleans everything once a week, so not much needed on the cleaning front.", "Sounds like he has more freedom than most dads with two kids under two", "I actually default to him on most of the child-based decisions (their food, nap time, baths, clothes). I actually *want* him to have more responsibility to plan and run things, but find things slip through the cracks, or he\u2019ll say he\u2019ll just do them tomorrow (but forget). We agreed that I\u2019ll write things down for him, so he doesn\u2019t have to think of it on his own. Most days now, he\u2019ll plan how his day is to be run, particularly if he wants to play golf at a certain time (mornings) or work on the car (afternoons) or hang out with friends (evenings).", "She probably thought if she showed him how to do it, he'd find his wings and fly.  Instead, he trained her to treat him like a teenager, and he's mostly okay with that because, well, he's immature, and not interested in self-actualization.", "It\u2019s true, I believe that we as women train guys to be this way by allowing it to continue. Because of this dynamic, intimacy has actually declined substantially. Im definitely not hanging around just for the sex (or lack thereof).", "I apologise if I  come off as rude, but if that's you being fair then it's pretty pathetic. The man is a stay at home parent who does nothing to manage his household, and the amount of hours he puts into parenting a week could barely be considered part-time work. You're essentially co-parenting with your nanny. \nGive him the choice of either actually running the household day to day, in other words actually become a stay at home parent/spouse, or going back to work.", "True that. The guy seems to need help tying his own shoelaces.", "If he hates that, now the kids are older, he should go to trades school or college and pick up some skills. Part of the push back you\u2019re getting is likely because he didn\u2019t like his work. Unless he\u2019d be independently wealthy, like a trust, if something happened to you, he needs to maintain a skill set one way or another.", "This is BS. Why do the counselors have to be male?", "Babe. It would literally be cheaper for you to get a divorce - you\u2019ve already coordinated and hired everyone who actually does the household work. Do you really need to subsidize his golf or hobby cars? You could spend that on a household manager who would take that mental load for you and actually put in the work to run your household! I can\u2019t believe he had the balls to say he needed a list to know what to do around his own house/kids as a SAHD *when he only watches them on his own one day a week.*\n\nSend him [this comic](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) and [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288). Tell him it\u2019s the ghost of Christmas near future.\n\nHow have you put up with this for so long? Life is painfully *short*. Find a man who helps lighten your load, not add to it. \n\nSet yourself free.", "I have ADHD, live by myself, with 2 dogs, on a tiny income, on a quarter acre block with a really old house Im constantly fixing and replacing rotting timber on. This guy has less to do than I do, and I have ADHD - the thing that means all of those plann-ey do the boring chores - work is exhausting is amplified! And I do it.  \n\n\nMan, all I wish for is an accountant and a cleaner and someone to walk / watch the dogs once a week and maybe a gardener.  \n\n\nHe has it SO EASY. He has 2 kids and still manages to get out of any responsiblities??", "So he\u2019s doing nothing. He can do all of those things in an hour, absolute max. You\u2019re quite literally better off without him. He\u2019s just making more work for you.", "So the only things he's willing to think about and plan for are his own selfish whims and nothing that has to do with you, your household, or his own children?  Seriously?", "I thought having male counselors would resonate with him more, and I truly thought they would see what a ridiculous situation we are in. We had a female counselor a few years back and he just felt attacked.\n\nI assume these counselors are trained to sympathize, rather than give an objective opinion on the situation? Especially if it could ostracize their client?", "To be fair, he does have a task list that he will usually complete. But, yes, I believe compared to most people we both have it 100x easier. I just wish that he wouldn\u2019t act like he has no free time after all the help we\u2019ve hired.", "I\u2019ve clocked it, while taking care of two kids, it\u2019s 3 hours max. He gets substantial amount of time for breaks and time off, but somehow doesn\u2019t realize compared to working parents, he has a lot of free time. I\u2019m definitely the bad guy for giving him tasks and, now, suggesting he just get a job and we\u2019ll split the tasks evenly.", "He\u2019ll coordinate around some of the tasks, and to be fair, when things are running behind, sometimes he\u2019ll cancel. But I\u2019m told I need to write everything down and be clear so he can plan his day.", "I feel like they\u2019re telling you what he wants to hear so you\u2019ll keep coming back. Your husband has it good, I think you\u2019re right to ask him to get a job or at least acknowledge that you\u2019ve made it way easy for him. Most SAHP don\u2019t have as much free time as he has. His attitude is ridiculous", "I think it\u2019s telling that he felt attacked by the female counselor. Would it be because she held him accountable to his behaviors?", "I did feel like she held us both accountable, but in the end, he acted out much worse from those counseling sessions. I actually feel like he regressed because he just felt attacked. The feedback that I\u2019m getting from the male counselors is that I need to be more understanding that his tolerance is lower than mine for having to do multiple tasks. I was starting to think maybe I\u2019m the crazy one?"]}
