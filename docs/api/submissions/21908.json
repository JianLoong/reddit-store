Humans are also prey animals, so we have evolved prey instincts in order to survive and evade predators. Trust your instincts and do not yield. Your body knows how to respond to a dangerous predator and your body is reacting the same way it would if someone placed your child next to a hungry tiger. Because essentially your family did that because no one stopped the FIL from leaving after they all heard you tell him that you want the baby with everyone else. You cannot trust them to respect your boundaries or feelings. So new nonnegotiable rule with your husband. Your child will not see any member of your husband's family without OP present, and that includes your husband. And if OP has to leave for any reason the baby goes with her even if it requires someone holding the baby right next to her so she can pee in peace. Every single one of them have ignored your concern and allow weird unacceptable behavior from the FIL. They all know there is no reason to take a baby to a non baby proofed shed full of dangerous tools and chemicals. It's dangerous and really age inappropriate. That's not even including the disrespect of not listening to your request to keep the baby around everyone. If OP is wrong the FIL gets his feelings hurt and OP damages her relationship with her husband's family. OP can work on rebuilding her trust and relationships within the family over time if she is wrong. However, if OP is right, the FIL will look for any possible way to get the child alone again and the second he does he's going to hurt the child for his own sexual gratification. And the child gets to suffer the consequences of the husband's and his family's inaction for the rest of their life. If this happens OP would never forgive herself for being unable to protect her child. So OP tell your husband his options are to follow the new rule completely or your daughter will not have a relationship with his family.

NTA that is creepy as fuck, did you guys confront him on this?", "NTA.  Your FIL is well creepy and weird.", "I've never seen such a bright red waving blazing strobing disaster flag as this story. That dude ain't touching baby", "He just wants to take the baby into the shed, in the middle of a family reunion? Wtf? \n\nNTA and always always stay close to your baby when he's around", "NTA.  Trust your gut!", "NTA!!!!  My blood is fucking boiling!\n\nYour husband is being a typical man* and downplaying the seriousness of this.  All the male blood relatives I have did this bullshit too because anyone AFAB is apparently \"too sensitive.\"  When I finally told my dad in college about being SA as a CHILD (happened summer before 6th grade on beach vacation), he blamed ME then said it wasn't that bad.  You know, because being forcibly molested by an older teen/young adult in public, having adults ignore me wanting help, and learning I cannot depend on any other humans at that age was definitely not traumatic.  I was a very shy gal; I didn't draw attention to myself.  I just wanted to read and draw.  (Not that it should matter.)  It might be the reason that to this day - in my 30s - I still don't like being touched.  But it definitely left an impression that I am alone and only have myself to rely on.  Please don't let this be your daughter.  Although, at least you're looking out for her, which my mom didn't.  Thank you for being an attentive mother!\n\nDon't let ANYONE make you feel guilty for defending her.  Something is very, very wrong with your FIL.  Your husband will ignore it because he's not the victim; he may continue to keep his head in the sand even after something does and just make excuses.  I hope not, but...  \ud83e\udd37  He doesn't take the already creepy behavior seriously.  Take precautions.  Change locks.  FIL has sneakily tried to trespass to mess around with your mom.  Your daughter has no defense and no words yet to say if something happens.  Your maternal instincts are sticking up for her.  Please continue to be her advocate.  This is very much a hill worth dying on if your husband continues to blow it off.  \n\n\n*I know some guys are going to complain about this, and if you're not like that - great!  I truly wish there were more of you!  Experience has taught me not to get my hopes up though.  From blood relatives to \"friends\", they downplay SA as something that doesn't actually happen, it's not \"that bad\", or the victim had it coming.  They have more sympathy for a guy getting called out than their victims.", "And he said he wanted to take her outside to get air then wants to take her into the shed ?", "This bit pissed me off. \"he wasn't there so he doesn't know what really happened\" so why does his lack of being there matter more than OP who was there, who heard what she heard, and saw what she saw??? That's basically just calling OP a liar because he wasn't there to corroborate her version of events himself.\n\nOP You don't just have a problem with your father in law, you have a problem with your husband too who is not listening to you. And i'm sorry but can you trust that one day, when you need to go out or go to work, he is not just going to take her over to the grandparents cos his Dad asked? And then go off doing some sort of chore and leave your daughter with him. Him denying it's a problem now, is ensuring he'll go behind your back in the future.\n\nDo you really want to wait for him \"to see something\"? By that time, if it'll ever happen because he stops when your husband is around, she'll have already come to harm.", "I'm also going to say that a shed itself isn't an appropriate environment for a baby (newborn?? Unsure from post). So much dust, mould, etc.\n\nThe family is also part of the problem. She told fil in front of them that she wanted the baby to stay with the group. The instant she left the room, he hightail-ed it out of there, and they seemingly did nothing.\n\nOp needs to insist on couple therapy (not religious affiliated) with their husband . He NEEDS to recognise why his dad's behaviour is dangerous, not just cringey. He has been exposed to it and a culture that enables, minimises, and covers his dad's behaviour his whole life. It takes time and work to undo decades of conditioning. once he recognises these issues, he would also benefit from some individual therapy.", "This!\n\nDon't try to be polite about it!\n\nSay it loudly, in front of everyone, that you think he's a predator and you're uncomfortable having him anywhere near your daughter!\n\nIf ANYONE lets him alone with her, they will never see you or your daughter ever again!\n\nMake it VERY CLEAR there will be NO second chances!\n\nAnd that includes hubby!", "yes!! please trust your instincts OP. die on this hill even if your husband disagrees, i felt sick reading this post, FIL is absolutely gross.", "This, please! Go no contact with your in-laws. They aren\u2019t safe around your baby as no one will keep your child safe for you. Your husband has to get on board with this. Your FIL will push boundaries to see what he can get away with so keep him on a polite tight leash. And if he\u2019s asking to do stuff ask why repeatedly until he answers or backs off. Be polite and pretend to be oblivious to the underlying intent he has. He won\u2019t want to explain himself", "I would be very surprised if he had, but you never know. I think it\u2019s more that he has been exposed to material he shouldn\u2019t have been and has not been spoken to about bodily urges and appropriate outlets. It\u2019s pretty common with Mormons in my experience.\n\nI\u2019m tolerated at best by my in laws. They are not open to whatever opinions I have. This is not something that is openly discussed. It is a deeply uncomfortable position to be in. I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to attempt to navigate his issues.", "That was my thought too", "Sorry to hear that for everyone", "I mean... I have been exposed to porn since kindergarten, sometimes watched journals with friends, sometimes alone, VHS cassettes... Never have I thought about doing anything with someone small. The only thing is that I found adult human bodies sexy and couldn't wait to do the things they do, NEVER did I think that it would be okay and appropriate to touch a baby or make them touch me.\n\nSo don't think it's because he watched inappropriate things at 12.\n\nOf course, everyone is different, everyone have different reasons for their actions, I am not saying that being exposed to sexual content doesn't fuck you up, it does, and a lot. I'm a functioning adult (27 years old) but I believe it affected me somehow, but to the opposite direction. I am more repulsed by porn now, I feel like it has been too much for me.\n\nBut at 12 you know better than to make a small kid touch your genitalia. He wasn't 5. He was 12. \n\nI really hope he just was stupid and wasn't SAd, but nothing guarantees this.", "Or hes copying what was done to him. Thats how the kids learn.", "Yep definitely red flags there... inappropriate sexual behaviours can be a sign of abuse."]}
