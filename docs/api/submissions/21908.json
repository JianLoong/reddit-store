We had to temporarily live with our in laws before I was pregnant. \n\nFil used to follow me around the house and look for any excuse to talk to me, often sitting  too close. He used to ask me for hugs because \u201c it\u2019s been so long since he has had physical contact with anyone\u201d which I felt was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable.\n\nWhen my mother came over to visit me he kept showing up unannounced so we asked him to call before he visits as I was recovering from a very traumatic pregnancy and difficult birth. \n\nOn one occasion I was hospitalised and fil found out and assumed my husband was with us. Fil showed up at our house, let himself in and then proceeded to ask my mom to take a long drive with him, my husband went down stairs and his father left the house immediately as without saying a word. \n\nDue to my baby\u2019s health we choose not to take her to visit family until recently, yesterday we brought her to the in laws, her two uncles were also there. Shortly after we arrived my husband borrowed their lawn mower. \n\nHis family were all in the living room taking turns cuddling with baby, when it was fil\u2019s turn he got up and tried to take her to a different room. I objected, saying that she was to stay with everybody. \n\n 20 minutes later I had to use the loo and mil was holding baby so I left the room for no more then 3 mins. When I returned fil had told everyone he was taking baby out into the backyard for air.  I immediately went outside and it felt like he was trying to evade me, I was literally chasing him around the yard, he said he was going to take her into his shed to spend some time with her and I said absolutely not. Mil had now come outside oblivious to what was happening. Fil sat down on a chair with baby, and the back garden gate swung open making a loud noise so I turned to look, it was husband returning with the lawnmower. \n\nI turned back to father in law and when I looked at him he moved his hand quickly from her upper thigh to her foot. She was fully clothed, maybe I\u2019m reading to much into that movement due to the stress of the situation and the fact that he has always creeped me out. I grabbed my baby. \n\nWhen we got into the car to go home I told my husband about his dad taking her outside despite me already telling him she was to stay with everyone and that he wanted to take her into his shed to spend time with her alone. Husband didn\u2019t think it was weird and blamed me for creating a situation. He said he wasn\u2019t there so he doesn\u2019t know what really happened. He has admitted to me in the past that his father is \u201ccringey\u201d around women.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep last night and felt sick. When I woke up today I told my husband that our daughter is never allowed to go to his parents house or be around his father unless I am present as I feel that my husband is not aware enough of the situation and isn\u2019t taking this seriously, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689044395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wevce/aita_for_not_wanting_my_baby_to_be_around_my/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's sketchy enough behaviour that it's safer to take no chances.", "NTA. Trust your gut. I have a nephew, he was 7 when my daughter was born. Never had a problem with him until then. I felt uncomfortable when he was around her and I couldn\u2019t say why. My other nephew didn\u2019t make me nervous like that. I decided I was being overly sensitive or just lacking patience. \n\nLong story short, I was suspicious for years and never left my daughter alone with him. Finally, after I had left the room, husband caught him trying to get our 2 year old to touch his penis. Husband talked to his sister (nephews mom), they said it would never happen again. Too long to post everything but my instincts were correct.\n\nNephew is 12 now and still lacking boundaries. Husband and I agree, he is not allowed to be alone with either of our daughters. No one else in the family takes it seriously. Don\u2019t back down OP. Make a scene. Your husband can pull his head out of his ass. Children are victimized by family all the time. FIL can spend time with her out in the open or not at all.", "He was going to \u201ctake her into the shed to spend some time with her\u201d????\n\nWtf world does he live in where that is an appropriate statement about ANYONE, let alone a BABY??\n\nNTA. I would not let him within a mile of her.\n\nEdit to add: also, your husband said his father is \u201ccringey around women\u201d??!! Again, this is a BABY!!  Your husband is also an A H for enabling whatever sick shit his father is into.", "NTA. That behaviour is really fucking weird.", "NTA\n\nHey husband\u2014your father tried to s-xually molest your daughter. Pay attention! WTF other reason would he have for taking her to a SHED IN THE YARD!!! It\u2019s a huge duty of yours to protect her from getting molested. Step up and do your job.\n\nNEVER LET THIS CREEP PREDATOR BE ALONE WITH YOUR CHILD. NEVER TAKE EVEN ONE CHANCE. \n\nHe already tried to molest her while the family was nearby! Who in their right mind would believe he had good intentions taking her to a shed!!!\n\nMom\u2014Don\u2019t be shy about raising the volume of your voice with him if need be. Like I did here lol. The family seems to be in denial about him.\n\nAnd you may want to do a mugshot/criminal history search on him. \n\nI\u2019m good with no contact with him too. Give it all you got. People have no idea how badly getting molested can ruin someone\u2019s entire life.", "NTA at all this is really alarming and your husband needs to take this more seriously. I would avoid going to your in laws house for awhile. I\u2019m so sorry This happened to you.", "NTA trust your instincts and protect your child. \n\nHow was FIL able to just let himself into your house? If he has a key then get it back or change the locks. If you don\u2019t lock your door then you need to start doing do.", "NTA but this made my stomach drop! A shed?! He was going to do something bad. Stay away from him forever!", "NTA. I'm a new mom too and this entire post just made my skin crawl. Trust your instincts. Do not let this man alone with your child and have a very serious talk with your husband so that he takes you seriously. That's very weird behavior.", "Wtf no this is alarming! I absolutely wouldn\u2019t let my child around him. At all. Super weird. ETA Nta.", "NTA That behaviour is really weird and alarming, better safe than sorry.", "Please please don\u2019t take any chances here. If someone had followed their instincts they admitted they had about allowing me around a certain family friend as a toddler - young pre teen, I would have avoided years of unspeakable and repeated SA. I am now barely surviving with debilitating ptsd. It ruins people. Honestly. You are doing the right thing protecting your child.", "Oh god NTA", "NTA. definitely some weird behavior going on there. Why would he try to get her alone like that?", "NTA, this makes me want to vomit, please protect your baby.", "NTA. \n\nYou need to keep Baby away from FIL. Your idea of not letting him be around Baby unless you are there is not good enough. You were gone for 3 minutes and he took her away from the group...AND NO ONE SAID ANYTHING. Sounds like MIL gave Baby to FIL...after she heard you say baby had to stay with everyone. \n\nHusband said he is cringy around woman but doesn't find it creepy that FIL was touching an infant's thigh?\n\nTwo uncles did not stand up for your wish for Baby to stay with the group? \n\nFIL leaves house immediately when Husband shows up. FIL moves his hand immediately drom her thigh when you turn around. These are signs of guilt and shame. Listen to them.\n\nNo one has your back on this. Protect your daughter please.", " Oh god NTA.      as  s.a survivor, his behaviour wants to make me vomit.  He's too creepy for words.  Put your foot down.  If necessary make your husband google child abuse to see how young it starts.", "NTA.  He is disgusting.  Your husband needs to pay attention and back you up on this.  This would be a deal breaker for me.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  When children are molested, it's frequently a family member who does the molesting.  \nAlways always always trust your gut instincts.

Better safe than sorry.", "I was molested as a child by the man who raised my father. I didn't tell my parents until I was about 24.

Protect yourself and your baby. Keto him away.

Even if nothing weird is happening he disrespected you by not listening when it came to your child and that\u2019s a no no."]}
