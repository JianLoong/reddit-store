The morning of, everything was going great until my sister arrived (she was a bridesmaid). My 3 year old niece was with her and wearing pajamas. I didn\u2019t think much of it at first, as it was still morning and figured they were both changing. My sister got in her dress and then tried to put my niece in hers. Niece was not having it and threw a huge tantrum. This was a dress she had worn before, tags were cut off. It wasn\u2019t a fancy dress by any means, my sister said she had bought it from Carter\u2019s.\n\nEventually, my sister said it wasn\u2019t worth the struggle and she didn\u2019t have to wear the dress. I asked what the plan was. She said \u201cshe\u2019ll just wear her pajamas\u201d. \n\nFor reference, niece was wearing [this](https://littlesleepies.com/products/pink-breakfast-buddies-two-piece-toddler-kids-bamboo-pajama-set?variant=22325588689014&currency=USD&nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A20307827266%3A%3A&nb_adtype=pla&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=127096917&nb_pc=online&nb_pi=LS-PJPBB13&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjw-vmkBhBMEiwAlrMeF3EYukAo8KjfdIsTFp4xLiJpc_e61LMgSdZtNCWI3Dvl_44KrTu8CRoCxyEQAvD_BwE)\n\nThey weren\u2019t clean either and smeared with niece\u2019s breakfast from the morning. My niece was the flower girl. I said from the start, I don\u2019t care what she wears, so long as it matched the color scheme (which this didn\u2019t). She could either wear a dress or a polo and khakis. Anything semi formal. I get dressing kids in fancy clothes is a chore so I tried to make it easy.\n\nBut I felt this was a step too far. I asked my sister if she could go buy something else, as we were near a Target and Old Navy. My sister said it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I said it was to me. We went back and forth until it became clear my niece couldn\u2019t come to the wedding (even if she wasn\u2019t a flower girl) in the pajamas. Finally, my sister got niece dressed. Niece was kicking and screaming, threw a whole tantrum. She was calmed down before we walked down the aisle, but my sister was visibly upset. \n\nLater on, my sister made it clear she thought I was a bridezilla and I should\u2019ve just let it go. \n\nAm I an asshole?\n\nEdit: Guys, stop making assumptions about my niece. She\u2019s normally a funny, sassy and great kid. She had one off moment. I wanted her in the wedding, my sister didn\u2019t force her. There was no one else to watch her and I did offer to have her just be a guest while all of this was going on but said she still couldn\u2019t wear her pajamas.", "created_utc": 1688145657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n6fq8/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_wear_pajamas_to_my/", "score": 3754, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand that kids at that age are unpredictable and will have a tantrum over something as little as a spoon, but you already gave your niece a relaxed enough dress code that your sister would've had options if the dress didn't work out. Did you try to help your sister dress your niece or help calm her down?", "NTA.  It sounds like you were as accommodating as possible.  Since the kid was part of the wedding party, dirty pjs are just not ok.\n\nHonestly, your sister sounds like a lazy parent.  Giving in to every little tantrum is gonna bite her in the ass one day, and then she'll be wondering why she has no respect from the kid and no authority.", "NTA.  Children need to learn how to function in the world.  We wear nice clothes to weddings.", "NTA\n\nLittle kids aren't a fan of weddings, that's expected. Your sister should've had some sort of backup dress that matched the scheme just in case her daughter didn't want to wear the flower girl dress. \n\nYour sister shouldn't have been mad at you for wanting your neice to look nice for your wedding.", "NTA. Being appropriately dressed is basically the most important requirement members of the wedding party are supposed to meet. Also this child is going to have to learn sometime or another that she can't just tantrum her way out of having to wear real clothes, her aunt's wedding is a good occasion to start.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Sometimes I think brides focus too much on the aesthetics of their 'perfect day' but I think it's perfectly reasonable to not want a kid in dirty pyjamas in your wedding photos. Understandably your sister was stressed by her tantruming child, but she almost certainly wouldn't have let someone in dirty pjs in her wedding photos either.", "NTA, but your sister is.", "NTA, hoy weren\u2019t asking much. Even clean pijamas would\u2019ve done the trick for me, dirty Jammie\u2019s? No thank you", "NTA. You were not wrong in wanting your niece to not wear dirty Jammies down the aisle. You were also very accommodating to the dress code. You\u2019re sister acted like a lazy, stubborn parent and was in the wrong. She could have accepted your and your mom\u2019s help to dress her, but refused. Refused to get her something else to wear. \u201cOh, dirty Jammies are good enough for my sister\u2019s wedding!\u201d  It\u2019s giving very disrespectful vibes. I hope your wedding was awesome, and glad to see that your niece calmed down and enjoyed herself.", "NTA. My daughter was a flower girl at 2. She had a similar relaxed dress code. So we took her to pick out a dress and hyped it up for a few weeks before. She got to practice with flowers. By the day of she was super excited to wear the dress and throw flowers. I get kids have one off moments - but as a parent we can also do everything to prepare them for new situations.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister\u2019s lazy parenting should not affect you on your big day. It was not appropriate for your niece to wear pyjamas to a wedding. You objecting is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA, but maybe you should have just said no flower girl as niece clearly wasn\u2019t in the mood.  Maybe there was an older teen dragged to the wedding who would have happily watched her for an hour for a 20, then for reception kid could wear pjs, but clean ones-so time to get her transitioned without a timeline.\n\nBut yea, it\u2019s ridiculous to think sending her down in dirty pjs (or dirty anything)", "NTA. I have a three-year-old - she'll throw a tantrum over anything. If it was up to her she would never brush her teeth, hair or bathe. Yeah, sometimes you have to get creative to calm them down but you shouldn't give in. \n\nI usually find giving them a choice works. For example, I'll show her two outfits and ask her which one she wants to wear.", "NTA\n\nDressed in clean clothes isn\u2019t an unreasonable expectation.", "It will be a funny story in years to come.. you can tell her you will come to her wedding in pjs.

Is your sister afraid her daughter won\u2019t like her or something?", "NTA. Your expectation seem to only be that she was in clean clothes that were the right color and not pjs. That is extremely far from being a bridzila and 100% reasonable. From reading your comments it seems like your sister just wanted to be lazy and not fight this battle. Which is not okay as it was a Wedding. We wear clean and nice looking clothes to weddings.", "NTA! YOUR special day! Not hers!", "NTA you were being very reasonable and your sister was being a lazy parent", "NTA- you weren\u2019t being picky about clothing. It\u2019s reasonable not to want dirty pjs at the wedding.", "nope, NTA.  Sister has issues and needs some parenting help...  sorry.   It's your wedding, you get to pick what is going on and who is there.", "NTA but your sister is", "NTA\u2014Sounds like your sister\u2019s checked out a bit and thinks acquiescing to her child is easier than parenting.

Sorry it put a damper on your special day.", "NTA\n\nI know parenting can be exhausting, but a wedding is not the time to give into your child's tantrums.

They bought the suit during a post-easter sale, wedding was July. Shockingly, the four year old outgrew the suit and threw a fit the day of. I let him walk down the aisle in gym shorts, a Darth Vader T-shirt, and sneakers. Luckily, everyone thought it was planned because hubs and I are big nerds, and had multiple star wars themed things at our wedding. \n\nBut most people would laugh at children being children, and it wouldn't detract from your wedding day.

Your niece had to change her outfit. It\u2019s never about the seatbelt. It\u2019s just a culmination of emotions and they just came take it anymore. Those Jammie\u2019s are cute, but not enough to be a flower girl", "NTA....is trantrum age. She needs to get the dress put.", "NTA. Come on. I hate parents that let their kids rule things. I would figure all little girls love getting dressed up like their moms.", "NTA kids have bad days, but it\u2019s reasonable for the adults to say \u201ceither you do x or you don\u2019t get to do y\u201d", "Oh hell no.

Dirty outfits at showtime are an absolute non-negotiable. If you can't wrestle the kid into their wedding clothes and keep them calm enough to get down the aisle you go without a flower girl. NTA", "NTA. Toddlers are tiny little unpredictable dictators if the parents let them be. It's completely expected that the flower girl not wear stained pj's and this would be a situation that absolutely needs the battle picked. As a mom, I would have brought two dresses in the color scheme and let the toddler pick if she was having an off day.", "NTA, but JFC some of these commenters are. Reddit hates kids in the weirdest way.", "If she won't wear the dress I get that, but then she shouldn't be the flower girl. My flower girl was that age and I knew she might not make it down the aisle or might be a toddler and end up not doing anything. They will still be married even without a flower girl.", "I was about to say YTA because kids are unpredictable and especially sassy at that age, and if they\u2019re a guest, hopefully you wouldn\u2019t notice. But when you said she was the flower girl, my mouth dropped open. Your sister absolutely should have put her in her dress. The kid would have her her freak out (or continued the meltdown), and eventually calmed down. 100% NTA!", "NTA. Dirty pajamas at a wedding are not ok. Your original choice for your niece was 100% reasonable. \n\nI get that she's 3 and had a moment but as a parent you work through that moment to get to where you need to be, even if it's hard. \n\nYou gave more than reasonable alternatives. Which I don't even think were necessary. But kind. \n\nAs a mom I would have brought at least 4 outfits of varying faciness just in case. None of those options would be pajamas. \n\nI'm glad your nice wore the completely reasonable option and got to enjoy your wedding with you!!!", "NTA. I would\u2019ve given your sister/niece a little slack except niece was literally in the wedding.

Wedding...", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. The kid is 3. Temper tantrums are par for the course. It sounds like your sister just didn't want to deal with it that day and didn't think you'd mind, or didn't care what you thought despite the fact that it was your wedding.

Three is too young for a participant in a wedding.", "I mean she's THREE.  Nobody cares if she's in her jammies.  You'll be happier if you let it go.", "NTA - niece sounds like a spoiled brat, and sister has created this.  Frankly, I wouldn't have trusted that she wouldn't misbehave during the ceremony, and told the sister that the brat could not come to the wedding.", "Likely going to get downvoted but NAH.\n\nYour niece is three. Toddlers have bad days.\n\nYour sister didn\u2019t think it was worth the tantrum but did end up putting in the effort to get her dressed. \n\nYou wanted your niece to look nice at your wedding. I do think you veer into A territory by stating the toddler couldn\u2019t come at all in pajamas even if she wasn\u2019t part of the wedding. No one would care if a toddler in the crowd is in pjs.\n\nThis all sounds like everyone was having high emotions.

She is 3, yet you wanted her to dress up and perform.  She is a toddler, not an accessory.  Both you and your sister should have said no to being a flower girl, there is no benefit to your niece.  You could have had some great stories that you and your niece could share in the future - remember when you came to my wedding in pj's that were covered with your breakfast, boy were you feisty that day....  Instead you made your niece and your sister miserable.  Happy - you made a child cry all for social media likes?", "YTA. Sometimes 3 year Olds won't wear a dress, or khakis, or the color blue, or whatever. If you didn't want a flower girl in pajamas, that's one thing. But kicking her out of the wedding completely and forcing your sister to manhandle her into the dress?\n\nWell at least you got your pretty wedding experience, so at least one of the toddlers in this story came out ok in the end.", "YTA, and jesus, people here are ridiculous. The kid is 3, and was doing what 3 years olds do.

Also it sounds like you\u2019d have allowed pajamas as long as they matched the color scheme and weren\u2019t dirty! Like I can\u2019t get over how relaxed you were with her outfit choice and your sister somehow managed to start a fight over it!", "NTA. \n\nShit happens when kids are involved, but you were as accommodating as you could be for the situation.", "Ahhh, the terrible twos\u2026which really don\u2019t end until they\u2019re about four, lol.  \n\nThis IS a battle your sister should have chosen to fight, though. It was very inconsiderate of her to think her child should be allowed to wear last nights dirty pajamas to your wedding. She is the ass, not you.", "NTA and your sister knows what kids are like, she could have had a backup pants and shirt that matched! Kids always need a change of clothes!", "NTA.  A flower girl should wear something that at least looks like someone is trying to look nice.  A pink  breakfast buddies dress might have worked, but not the pyjamas.", "So, first, NTA. I was MOH in my best friends wedding when my daughter was 3 and also a flower girl. I gotbher in her dress with the help of lots of toys and doing things in steps, butbshe had a meltdown about the sash. I let her do her thing, then put it on.\n\nThe fun part was when it came to walking down the aisle. She absolutely refused to. So before she could start screaming, I picked her up and carried her down the aisle as she threw the flowers. I could hear my best friend laughing the entire way.\n\nMy point is, toddlers will be toddlers, and you make sure to leave yourself enough time for them to do it. Simple things, like carrying her down the aisle is fine. But she knew the kid had to be in the dress, so you make sure you allot enough time to get the dress on, including tantrums.", "The sister probably should have come with more than one option to begin with. She's 3. 3 year olds make so many messes and throw so many tantrums. Why was there no suitable contingency plan if life happened?", "That's why we don't bring toddlers to formal events?", "Why is she helping with her niece at all on her wedding day?", "Ahhh threenagers, such a fun age. \n\nYou're NTA. Niece was in wedding party and even if she wasn't, she needed to be appropriately dressed. Her mum is clearly stressed/exhausted but that's part of the parenting gig really ... \n\nYou can tell it as a funny story one day \"oh hey niece, remember when you loved your pyjamas so much you tried to walk down the aisle at my wedding in them?\"", "THIS. I have a 2.5 year old and he *hates* wearing clothes I pick out. So what did I do for Easter this year? I gave him three outfit choices (all of which were acceptable), but also knowing that the top I really wanted him to wear (blue polo) would be the most attractive. He wore the blue polo and was happy cuz he picked it, and I was happy because he was dressed appropriately for church/dinner.\n\nToddlers can be unpredictable but with a little forethought *usually* you can manage their behavior.\n\nOP is NTA", "You can't even really get away with wearing PJs to preschool at 3.  They want to take the kids outside and similar.  Even on PJ day the kids brought pants to change into so they could go play outside.", "Modern parenting in a nutshell.", "I hear you.  I thought the pajamas were not bad in a \"kids will be kids\" kind of way and it'd be funny in the long-run until I read that they were filthy.  That crossed the line for me.", "How?? Dress codes apply to guests", "Seriously?", "She\u2019s upset at her sister not her niece", "What a strange thing to say - long before social media wearing pajamas to a wedding would not be appropriate.", "Honestly, sometimes it's easier to have someone who isn't mom help dress. I nanny and sometimes the kids just want me to help them with jackets and shoes, not mom \ud83d\ude05 the rules are different with auntie / grandma", "What your sister should have done was go get another outfit and then ask her [your niece] which one did she want to wear.  This worked every time with my very obstinate and opinionated toddler.", "NTA but this is definitely why a lot of people don\u2019t want kids in/at their wedding", "For a tantrumming three year old sometimes all it requires is a change of scene to reset. And an out from the original power struggle. Having a third option appear, or having someone walk away with the kid for twenty minutes could have cooled everyone off (or not, 3 yr olds are pure chaos).", "That\u2019s the part that gets me. She had no alternative clothes for an all day outing?! What if she had an accident or spill something large on herself! Like no alternatives at all?!", "Won't lie, I'm thinking about this in relation to my own headstrong child and the total lack of description of bribes leads me to think the sister is more than a bit of an AH here...\n\n\nIf I REALLY want my kid to do something I pack a bribe bag with the rare treats - Tim Tams, juice, glow sticks, stickers and the most annoying book in the universe with sound effect buttons - so that I've got ways to deal for the important moments.", "Exactly. Grocery store in weather appropriate pajamas - sure let it go. Flower girl at a wedding - you need to pick that battle.", "If she had calmly dressed the kid at home it probably would have been fine. Instead she was likely running late, rushed and impatient. Then drag a toddler into the chaos of everyone trying to get ready, argue with OP, get more stressed and impatient with toddler.  She is the cause of her own problem here.", "100% agreed. You don't always have to fight the tantrum - but a wedding?", "It's a 3 year old.  It will be alright.", "Haha my wedding me i", "Yeah sometimes I'll let you know my kid's grandparents/aunts/uncles not override me, but help and I step back.\n\nSometimes an outside person can get things done.", "The part that gets me is that the niece was *the flower girl*. Like sure, if she was a normal guest, whatever, and usually I'm a who-cares-about-the-aesthetic kind of gal, but I would not want soiled pj's in my wedding photos.", "It might have been the unfamiliar room, not knowing everybody in there, the excitement, perhaps hunger or thirst, whatever. It's sometimes difficult to have a little rebel if you're in a hurry, but honestly, it's usually easier to ask a bunch of simple questions and use the answers to your advantage. And once the child is calm and her needs are met, how easy is it to point out all the beautiful women (bridesmaids and bride) and tell her when she wears that dress, she's part of the group and she can have some delicious cake later?", "\u201cLetting someone run roughshod\u201d lolol you\u2019re fucking hilarious saying that about a 3 year old", "Sometimes when I give my daughter a choice she\u2019ll refuse to make it so I\u2019ll make the choice. \u201cIf you won\u2019t choose I will do you can wear blue.\u201d \u201cI choose green.\u201d Choice made less arguing \ud83d\ude02", "The situation with the child is one thing, but the flippant attitude from mom would\u2019ve got me heated", "I have to say I was tending towards \"eh she's little no one cares if a little toddler in arms is wearing pajamas\" until I saw she was the FLOWER GIRL.", "And like, bribes aren't for all the time, and it sounds like you know that, but her aunt's wedding where she's the flower girl? A few Tim Tams or whatever on this day won't hurt in the long run. Sister tried to give up so early and easy!", ">bribe bag\n\nI found my people.", "This reminds me of when I was a flower girl at my aunt\u2019s wedding. My flower boy counterpart had a complete meltdown, but I was fine because I was bribed with a ton of candy and money early on during the day. By the time they tried to bribe flower boy he was already too committed to his meltdown.", "Definitely agree! Especially at big events like this where kids are supposed to be all smiles and sweetness. She should've had a reward gift planned for after the ceremony for sure!", "Exactly. We all bribe our kids at one point or another. & you always have that bag of tricks/treats ready for important events. Only an A H wouldn\u2019t. NTA OP", "This is highly kid-dependent tbh. My extremely stubborn child is immune to bribes. \n\nBut yeah, it definitely sounds like the sister could've tried harder. Since they did eventually wrangle the girl into the dress and she walked down the aisle ok, then obviously this was possible to do and the sister shouldn't have given up so fast and suggested she stay in dirty pajamas of all things.", "Ehhhh, generally if you really want a kid this age to look nice in something you don't want to put it in them too far ahead of time. Kids (especially toddlers) have a fantastic knack for completely wrecking an outfit the one time you really need them not to.", "A wedding is the complete opposite of things being routine.", "It does not always work like that.", "Its very reasonable to not want your flower girl/niece to wear dirty pajamas walking down the aisle. OP was very accommodating. You must be super fun at parties.", "My friend would refuse to eat as a kid and his mum would walk him to his aunts put the same plate with the same food down and he would eat it no questions asked. Kids are weird like that", "I think that's where the line has to be drawn\n\nI'd think it was hilarious if I got to show my niece the pictures of her running around in dirty PJs, in 15 years time. But if she's front-and-centre as a flower girl, not so amusing", "Exactly. Treat the child like a real person instead of an object, and watch how much better both of your lives will get\n\nThank you so much for your nuanced and insightful opinion, u/EatThisShit. Much appreciated", "My PJs are a tank top, sweatshirt, and leggings. I see people wearing this get up in the street all the time, so I figure I\u2019m allowed.", "Jokes on you, my day clothes *are* my pajamas.", "At a formal event, agreed, but otherwise why would you care", "I'm an elementary teacher and I always feel like such a bum when I have to run somewhere after school on pj day \ud83d\ude2c but I live way out in the country so it makes no sense to go home and change myself and my child just to run into the store for 5 minutes. I always feel like I'm being judged by people like you lol. My son and I are both bathed and got dressed that morning. What we got dressed in just happens to be PJs.", "Eh, it's not something worth getting worked about (except maybe at formal events). You don't know what else is going on in someone's day that they decided to wear their pjs out.", "Haha many years ago my husband was looking after a little person who was dear to us. They were dropped off at our place in the morning and husband  assumed the outfit already on child was a cute little dress.\n\nHe didn\u2019t figure it out til the end of the day. They had done a lot of errands together.", "hmmm I bet you're a treat to hang out with...", "I wear PJs everyday. But I don\u2019t wear them to work (unless it\u2019s pajama day with the kids) I don\u2019t wear them to church, weddings, funerals, or anything to do with a dress code.", "Lol I eat ass. Go off.", "But, honestly, why? Why do you care?", "Nope, if it\u2019s my day off I might *put on* pajama pants to run out for a minute. It has absolutely no impact on anyone else", "I\u2019ll wear PJs and loungewear at home but I don\u2019t go out in it. The closest I get is wearing a black lounge-y PJ tee to walk my dog in the morning but it just looks like a slouchy tshirt from afar. \n\nKids also get a pass if they\u2019re traveling, sick or little and running errands around bedtime.", "This. I think between 3-9 months my son wore pyjamas but he\u2019s 1 now and I make a point to dress him everyday- good habits but if we go to a party, he wears a nice shirt. Yeah it might have dinosaurs or crocodiles on but it\u2019s not a t-shirt. It\u2019s a shirt shirt \ud83d\ude02", "A lot of people/kids don't seem to understand 'time and place'. There is a time to wear pj's and a wedding isn't it", "Who fucking cares if a kid is wearing pajamas?", "I tend not to wonder about people and their clothes. I don't know what's going on in their day. \n\nI've had family emergencies that required running out of the house - barely remembering to grab my phone (which doubles as a wallet/purse). I've been sick and still had to take my kid to school. I wasn't getting dressed to just roll back up in bed, and people at the gas station could deal with me pumping gas. Yes, I looked and felt a hot mess, but sometimes you do what you have to do. I've been in such severe depression that I just didn't give a damn. I was breathing and moving, and that was more than enough. I've also been a substitute teacher and dressed up for school events.\n\nI try to find sympathy for my fellow humans because life can sometimes kick butt. How they are dressed is just not a huge thing with me. I'm more concerned how people act to others.\n\nNTA for OP because they tried and gave a lot of leeway to dress code. Weddings are special, and there were other options. Also, I'm sure the niece will be appreciative as an adult. No long, drawn-out replay of how you were a horrid child and ruined photos from Mom. Because yeah, that has happened.", "Meh, unless you keep coming into my space and smell like shit why would I give two craps? Most pajamas cover up more than everyday clothing. It's just the knowledge that they are pajamas that make the difference. For some people the only time they wear pajama kind of clothes is when they want something comfy but need to be around other people so can't be their naked self like they are usually at home. So it's not a dirty thing either, but even if it was their blue jeans are likely washed even less. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's strictly perception and personal opinion. They could be wearing pajamas because they aren't in a position to have a lot of clothes to have spares to wear when they are washing the rest and only have a small of time to get personal stuff done because the rest of their time spent is working to allow them to one day have the privilege of have a closet full of clothes.\n\nSome people refuse to drive a van, while other people think it's what's perfect for them. This sort of stuff that doesn't affect me at all doesn't warrant time spent on it. I'd rather be friendly and look at the good thing that bring to the table, instead of being like \"oh, no... do you see that she's wearing ugly ass sweats with a t-shirt, how poor looking\"...", "Hahahahaha\n\nYou have never been around a 3-year old, have you?", "We were taught this in nursing school.  Give the kids a choice in as far as you can.  That doesn't mean they have the choice between taking their medication or not, but they can get their choice of drink to wash it down with or something like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've used the same logic with my own kids and it cuts down on the arguments (not always, but more often than not).", "Yup. I often get \"NO\" as an answer \"No wasn't an option, you can choose between x and y and id you dont choose then mommy is going to choose x\"", "My reaction exactly.", "I dunno. I agree she couldntbe the flower girl but OP was saying she couldnt be at the wedding AT ALL and I do think thats a bit ridiculous. Maybe I'm biased because my own wedding had children and I wouldn't have cared myself.", "Right this is wild to me. I have a 3 yr old. You can bet your ass I travel with emergency gummy worms in my car for normal everyday scenarios. A wedding where she\u2019s the flower girl? Oh boy I would have had a back pack full", "100% can confirm. My son is pretty picky but he eats better at his friends houses than at home!", "Sometimes I let my kid wear her fluffy onesie out.

You get dressed, dressed can be sweatpants or leggings and a cozy sweater. But pjs are not street wear.", "Jokes on everyone, my pajamas are under my clothes!

I'd make exceptions for people with an injury or illness needing accomodation (god knows it's hard enough to find trousers that fit over knee braces or casts at short notice let alone accessible formal wear) but the outfit should be clean at least.

That's highly disrespectful of the mother to not even entertain any other options or help offered to her.", "Because the bride has crappy relatives?", "We included all of our nieces and nephews as flower girls or ring bearers when we got married (6 kids at the time). All I asked was nice, coordinating  clothes and, despite practically living in sweatpants, my SIL got my nephew in dress pants and a button up shirt that day no questions asked. \n\nThe chose your battles part in that situation was, last minute, one of my sisters in law ended up carrying her daughter down the aisle and my youngest two nieces sat with their dad and grandparents rather than going down the aisle. They looked nice for the photos and there was no stress or sobbing toddlers. Plenty of leeway can be given on big days to keep kids happy without being a drama queen and insisting your child wear dirty pajama in your sibling\u2019s wedding.", "Eff that! The kid would have gotten her food all over the dress if mom put her in that. I would totally have my kid change into the wedding clothes at the wedding, to keep them nice. There is no reason to dirty a 3rd outfit. She would have just refused to change out of her street clothes and had the same problem. How many costume changes do you expect people to go through for your personal viewing pleasure?", "Yeah, no thanks, but continue to worry yourself about what I'm wearing. I'm sure that you stressing about what non-obscene clothing I might be near you in public in won't shorten your lifespan or anything.\n\nOF COURSE for a wedding, going to work IN an office, or similar, there is a standard of dress that is expected, and I'll gladly meet that.\n\nWhen I got up at 7 AM this morning and picked up a Zipcar to do a big grocery haul? Yeah, still in my PJs. I did brush my hair and teeth before I left the house, so I wasn't going out \"stinky and unkempt,\" just \"coming as I was\" to...the grocery store. No one has to \"get dressed\" (I was dressed, so that's a weird thing to say anyway) to your \"standard\" for everyday activities.", "What about when pj\u2019s are fancy enough that you forget they\u2019re for sleeping?! \n\nMy kid has a frozen \u201cnightgown\u201d that looks legit like a fancy dress/dress up dress. It doesn\u2019t look like a nightgown to me so she wears it during the day instead of to bed. I at some point forgot/didn\u2019t realize it was actually a nightgown until a kid behind us in line commented and the dad was all \u201cyou have that same nightgown\u201d (said multiple times). I felt bad but also like, dude I\u2019m not going to argue with a 4 year old if something is a dress, play clothes, or a fancy dress, especially not to go to target. If she want to wear hot pink shorts and a lime green and orange polka dotted top with red rain boots (or conversely decide a dress is too nice to sleep in and want to wear it during the day), I\u2019m gonna be glad her hair is brushed. She can figure out her style. \n\nBut we also make a big deal about dressing up fancy for certain occasions.", "My kid is 5 weeks old and I\u2019ve already taken to telling her, \u201cIf you give me a burp, you can have more boob.\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Seconding this", "My cousin was Superman every day for the longest time. We thought he was past it when he came to Thanksgiving in a suit. But he was just waiting for the appropriate time to yell, \"THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR... <pause for a full minute while he unbuttoned everything to reveal he had the costume on underneath the whole time>..SUPERMAN!!!\"", "UNLESS it's PJ Wedding."]}
