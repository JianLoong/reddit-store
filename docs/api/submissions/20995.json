The morning of, everything was going great until my sister arrived (she was a bridesmaid). My 3 year old niece was with her and wearing pajamas. I didn\u2019t think much of it at first, as it was still morning and figured they were both changing. My sister got in her dress and then tried to put my niece in hers. Niece was not having it and threw a huge tantrum. This was a dress she had worn before, tags were cut off. It wasn\u2019t a fancy dress by any means, my sister said she had bought it from Carter\u2019s.\n\nEventually, my sister said it wasn\u2019t worth the struggle and she didn\u2019t have to wear the dress. I asked what the plan was. She said \u201cshe\u2019ll just wear her pajamas\u201d. \n\nFor reference, niece was wearing [this](https://littlesleepies.com/products/pink-breakfast-buddies-two-piece-toddler-kids-bamboo-pajama-set?variant=22325588689014&currency=USD&nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A20307827266%3A%3A&nb_adtype=pla&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=127096917&nb_pc=online&nb_pi=LS-PJPBB13&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjw-vmkBhBMEiwAlrMeF3EYukAo8KjfdIsTFp4xLiJpc_e61LMgSdZtNCWI3Dvl_44KrTu8CRoCxyEQAvD_BwE)\n\nThey weren\u2019t clean either and smeared with niece\u2019s breakfast from the morning. My niece was the flower girl. I said from the start, I don\u2019t care what she wears, so long as it matched the color scheme (which this didn\u2019t). She could either wear a dress or a polo and khakis. Anything semi formal. I get dressing kids in fancy clothes is a chore so I tried to make it easy.\n\nBut I felt this was a step too far. I asked my sister if she could go buy something else, as we were near a Target and Old Navy. My sister said it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I said it was to me. We went back and forth until it became clear my niece couldn\u2019t come to the wedding (even if she wasn\u2019t a flower girl) in the pajamas. Finally, my sister got niece dressed. Niece was kicking and screaming, threw a whole tantrum. She was calmed down before we walked down the aisle, but my sister was visibly upset. \n\nLater on, my sister made it clear she thought I was a bridezilla and I should\u2019ve just let it go. \n\nAm I an asshole?\n\nEdit: Guys, stop making assumptions about my niece. She\u2019s normally a funny, sassy and great kid. She had one off moment. I wanted her in the wedding, my sister didn\u2019t force her. There was no one else to watch her and I did offer to have her just be a guest while all of this was going on but said she still couldn\u2019t wear her pajamas.", "created_utc": 1688145657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n6fq8/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_wear_pajamas_to_my/", "score": 397, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand that kids at that age are unpredictable and will have a tantrum over something as little as a spoon, but you already gave your niece a relaxed enough dress code that your sister would've had options if the dress didn't work out. Did you try to help your sister dress your niece or help calm her down?", "NTA.  It sounds like you were as accommodating as possible.  Since the kid was part of the wedding party, dirty pjs are just not ok.\n\nHonestly, your sister sounds like a lazy parent.  Giving in to every little tantrum is gonna bite her in the ass one day, and then she'll be wondering why she has no respect from the kid and no authority.", "NTA.  Children need to learn how to function in the world.  We wear nice clothes to weddings.", "NTA\n\nLittle kids aren't a fan of weddings, that's expected. Your sister should've had some sort of backup dress that matched the scheme just in case her daughter didn't want to wear the flower girl dress. \n\nYour sister shouldn't have been mad at you for wanting your neice to look nice for your wedding.", "NTA. Being appropriately dressed is basically the most important requirement members of the wedding party are supposed to meet. Also this child is going to have to learn sometime or another that she can't just tantrum her way out of having to wear real clothes, her aunt's wedding is a good occasion to start.", "NTA Three years old tantrums are about control. As I recall, you just have stay calm, reassuring, don't punish and don't give in. Getting ready for a weddings is hectic and your sister was probably taking the path of least resistance but a flower girl in dirty pajamas is not okay. Once your niece realized she she was not in control and got dressed kicking and screaming, she calmed down. Sometimes you just have to put up with the tantrum.", "NTA. Sometimes I think brides focus too much on the aesthetics of their 'perfect day' but I think it's perfectly reasonable to not want a kid in dirty pyjamas in your wedding photos. Understandably your sister was stressed by her tantruming child, but she almost certainly wouldn't have let someone in dirty pjs in her wedding photos either.", "NTA, but your sister is.", "NTA, hoy weren\u2019t asking much. Even clean pijamas would\u2019ve done the trick for me, dirty Jammie\u2019s? No thank you", "NTA. You were not wrong in wanting your niece to not wear dirty Jammies down the aisle. You were also very accommodating to the dress code. You\u2019re sister acted like a lazy, stubborn parent and was in the wrong. She could have accepted your and your mom\u2019s help to dress her, but refused. Refused to get her something else to wear. \u201cOh, dirty Jammies are good enough for my sister\u2019s wedding!\u201d  It\u2019s giving very disrespectful vibes. I hope your wedding was awesome, and glad to see that your niece calmed down and enjoyed herself.", "NTA. My daughter was a flower girl at 2. She had a similar relaxed dress code. So we took her to pick out a dress and hyped it up for a few weeks before. She got to practice with flowers. By the day of she was super excited to wear the dress and throw flowers. I get kids have one off moments - but as a parent we can also do everything to prepare them for new situations.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister\u2019s lazy parenting should not affect you on your big day. It was not appropriate for your niece to wear pyjamas to a wedding. You objecting is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA, but maybe you should have just said no flower girl as niece clearly wasn\u2019t in the mood.  Maybe there was an older teen dragged to the wedding who would have happily watched her for an hour for a 20, then for reception kid could wear pjs, but clean ones-so time to get her transitioned without a timeline.\n\nBut yea, it\u2019s ridiculous to think sending her down in dirty pjs (or dirty anything)", "NTA. I have a three-year-old - she'll throw a tantrum over anything. If it was up to her she would never brush her teeth, hair or bathe. Yeah, sometimes you have to get creative to calm them down but you shouldn't give in. \n\nI usually find giving them a choice works.

Is your sister afraid her daughter won\u2019t like her or something?", "NTA. Your expectation seem to only be that she was in clean clothes that were the right color and not pjs. That is extremely far from being a bridzila and 100% reasonable. From reading your comments it seems like your sister just wanted to be lazy and not fight this battle. Which is not okay as it was a Wedding. We wear clean and nice looking clothes to weddings.", "NTA! YOUR special day! Not hers!", "NTA you were being very reasonable and your sister was being a lazy parent", "NTA- you weren\u2019t being picky about clothing. It\u2019s reasonable not to want dirty pjs at the wedding.", "nope, NTA.  Sister has issues and needs some parenting help...  sorry.   It's your wedding, you get to pick what is going on and who is there.", "NTA but your sister is", "NTA\u2014Sounds like your sister\u2019s checked out a bit and thinks acquiescing to her child is easier than parenting. She definitely should\u2019ve had some backup options regardless of your niece\u2019s mood. Sorry it put a damper on your special day.", "NTA\n\nI know parenting can be exhausting, but a wedding is not the time to give into your child's tantrums. Especially when that child is in the wedding.", "NTA my 2 year old was a flower girl and we went thru a half dozen dresses at home before settling on one she would wear. PJ\u2019s were not an option", "Pajamas might have been cute.  But dirty pajamas?  Nope.", "Meh. My nephew was supposed to wear a suit that matched my husband's, as he was the \"ring bearer\". They bought the suit during a post-easter sale, wedding was July. Shockingly, the four year old outgrew the suit and threw a fit the day of. I let him walk down the aisle in gym shorts, a Darth Vader T-shirt, and sneakers. Luckily, everyone thought it was planned because hubs and I are big nerds, and had multiple star wars themed things at our wedding. \n\nBut most people would laugh at children being children, and it wouldn't detract from your wedding day. But you're not at fault the day of for putting your foot down. NTA", "NTA. My almost 4yo threw a tantrum before takeoff on an airplane. You just have to deal. He had to wear a seatbelt. Your niece had to change her outfit. It\u2019s never about the seatbelt. It\u2019s just a culmination of emotions and they just came take it anymore. Those Jammie\u2019s are cute, but not enough to be a flower girl", "NTA....is trantrum age. She needs to get the dress put.", "NTA. Come on. I hate parents that let their kids rule things. I would figure all little girls love getting dressed up like their moms.", "NTA kids have bad days, but it\u2019s reasonable for the adults to say \u201ceither you do x or you don\u2019t get to do y\u201d", "Oh hell no.

NTA.", "I've seen flower girls in pj's, but they were special brand new pj outfits they changed into for the reception after their big job was done for the day, and they looked like they had probably been purchased from the dress shop--these were not Walmart clearance rack jammies.  Dirty outfits at showtime are an absolute non-negotiable. If you can't wrestle the kid into their wedding clothes and keep them calm enough to get down the aisle you go without a flower girl. NTA", "NTA. Toddlers are tiny little unpredictable dictators if the parents let them be. It's completely expected that the flower girl not wear stained pj's and this would be a situation that absolutely needs the battle picked. As a mom, I would have brought two dresses in the color scheme and let the toddler pick if she was having an off day.", "NTA, but JFC some of these commenters are. Reddit hates kids in the weirdest way.", "If she won't wear the dress I get that, but then she shouldn't be the flower girl. My flower girl was that age and I knew she might not make it down the aisle or might be a toddler and end up not doing anything. They will still be married even without a flower girl.", "I was about to say YTA because kids are unpredictable and especially sassy at that age, and if they\u2019re a guest, hopefully you wouldn\u2019t notice.

The kid would have her her freak out (or continued the meltdown), and eventually calmed down. 100% NTA!", "NTA. Dirty pajamas at a wedding are not ok. Your original choice for your niece was 100% reasonable. \n\nI get that she's 3 and had a moment but as a parent you work through that moment to get to where you need to be, even if it's hard. \n\nYou gave more than reasonable alternatives. Which I don't even think were necessary. But kind. \n\nAs a mom I would have brought at least 4 outfits of varying faciness just in case. None of those options would be pajamas. \n\nI'm glad your nice wore the completely reasonable option and got to enjoy your wedding with you!!!", "NTA. I would\u2019ve given your sister/niece a little slack except niece was literally in the wedding.

Three is too young for a participant in a wedding.", "I mean she's THREE.  Nobody cares if she's in her jammies.  You'll be happier if you let it go.", "NTA - niece sounds like a spoiled brat, and sister has created this.

Toddlers have bad days.\n\nYour sister didn\u2019t think it was worth the tantrum but did end up putting in the effort to get her dressed. \n\nYou wanted your niece to look nice at your wedding.

She is 3, yet you wanted her to dress up and perform.  She is a toddler, not an accessory.  Both you and your sister should have said no to being a flower girl, there is no benefit to your niece.  You could have had some great stories that you and your niece could share in the future - remember when you came to my wedding in pj's that were covered with your breakfast, boy were you feisty that day....  Instead you made your niece and your sister miserable.  Happy - you made a child cry all for social media likes?", "YTA. Sometimes 3 year Olds won't wear a dress, or khakis, or the color blue, or whatever. If you didn't want a flower girl in pajamas, that's one thing. But kicking her out of the wedding completely and forcing your sister to manhandle her into the dress?\n\nWell at least you got your pretty wedding experience, so at least one of the toddlers in this story came out ok in the end.", "YTA, and jesus, people here are ridiculous.

I would\u2019ve been upset if it became a further issue. But I didn\u2019t raise my voice or tear up. I just said \u201chey, she can\u2019t come if she\u2019s wearing her dirty pajamas\u201d. That was all I said, repeatedly.\n\nYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t give a 3 year old a pass. Because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to ask her to wear anything but dirty pajamas. I even offered to pay for a separate outfit of my niece\u2019s choice. Didn\u2019t have to be fancy. Just not dirty pajamas. My sister didn\u2019t even entertain the idea. She didn\u2019t even try to get my niece to look at other outfits. It\u2019f be one thing if she did and my niece said no to all. Even then, I wouldn\u2019t allow the pajamas, but it\u2019s not like I insisted she wear an itchy, poofy dress. Even her original dress was a simple linen sundress. \n\nSister insisted it be the dirty pajamas or nothing else. Didn\u2019t even try to compromise.", "OP sounds great. It\u2019s a reasonable expectation that guests of any age are appropriately dressed for the occasion. No, it doesn\u2019t make \u201cfun memories\u201d of the time the toddler walked down the aisle in filthy jammies. It\u2019s not hilarious.\n\nNiece is three. She\u2019s old enough to hear no", "I mean I used to have PJ days when I was younger (and still now sometimes) which are great relaxation days. My parents allow it from time to time.\n\nHowever, the minute we go outside in public or there are guests coming we have to get dressed.\n\nI greatly enjoy PJ days", "That\u2019s kids.  You did make the choice to include kids.  You are NTA for the options presented, m but the potential of there being a need to outline such choices is a direct result of rolling the dice on kids in the first place.  \n\nSo I would say your sis isn\u2019t an AH for you having to outline the options.  She\u2019s only an AH for her attitude abt it.", "Sure, you had all of the control so you didn't need to get upset.  You just made a declaration and then made a big deal of it on a subreddit.  I'm not even sure you're for real now.  Cheers.", "I guess some people just don't have a sense of humor.  There seems to be this idea that perfection means everyone behaving as prescribed.  I think perfection is a little messier, I would definitely have let the kid walk down the aisle in jammies, proudly.  And I think the guests would find it endearing as well.  Sometimes people getting married have an idea of perfection that I find miserable.  They're allowed, but that doesn't mean they're not assholes.", "Yeah pj days at home are nice occasionally. But we also never leave our house in them or around visitors either.", "Except this wasn't a kid problem it was a lack of parenting problem", "Humor is subjective and if you want a kid in jammies that\u2019s on you. It doesn\u2019t make other people who have set reasonable expectations assholes either.\nI wish you blessings in your slob life.", "Yeah, asking her to wear [this dress](https://www.carters.com/carters-toddler-girl-dresses/V_2L742910.html)-that she picked out and was something already in her closet-was looking for perfection."]}
