He was sad because apparently I cheated on him in his dream and he wanted me to cuddle him in bed for comfort. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it but he said he wanted to talk about it later. \nI kinda thought that was weird that he wouldn\u2019t just tell me the dream and I don\u2019t know why he would want to bring it up later. I like to deal with things and move on, and I know it would linger in my mind if he didn\u2019t tell me. \n\nAbout an hour later I asked him to just tell me the dream (who/where/what happened) but he refused saying he was uncomfortable telling me and that he will tell me \u201clater\u201d. That upset me because I feel like he is keeping things from me for no good reason and just being stubborn and weird about it and it makes me uncomfortable. Now he is upset that I am upset and is saying I\u2019m trying to manipulate him and guilt trip him into telling me. I am being honest by telling him that it will weigh on my mind until he tells me, So AITA?\n\nEdit: he told me the dream and I wish he hadn\u2019t because it\u2019s not something either of us want to think about. I feel terrible that I pressured him into doing it. I accept I\u2019m the asshole here and a real dick to my sweet bf. He is upset and anxious, how do I solve it?\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the responses! Pretty ironic how many people telling me I\u2019m TA wanting to know the dream!!!

This sounds similar, and you really shouldn't have forced him to tell you something that clearly is upsetting him. Tbh you shouldn't be forcing your boyfriend to do anything. Let him tell you on his own terms, and support him in the meantime. Acting like he's hiding things from you just because of a nightmare he had is pretty unfair to him.

If it said anything like all women do this  or other generalization yes itd be sexist. Hes just pointing out that the behavior op did is why most men have issues sharing. Which is a fact. Men are treated the way op did to the bf by society as a whole. Neither they nor myself are pointing at women its just an engrained thing in society. You have made a logic valid thing into a sexual issue which to me is more sexist then the one you replied to as you A) assumed their gender.  B) twisted their meaning to suit your own needs   and C) you stawmanned or \"mansplained/womensplained\" your opinion. \n\n\nTho you are correct its a human problem you are also incorrect in assuming peoples thoughts and your making both yourself and the issue seem less valid by your actions.....as you said its better to be part of the solution so perhaps dont be so hostile to those on your sude lest you find yourself alone", "Lol the classic \"you're downvoting me so you're part of the problem proving I'm right\".", "Huh?

Will cause you to spiral and drag this out further until you break something.\n\nYou handle things head on but this is not about you or your thing to handle. So you forcing him is causing  him trauma just so you can be in control and feel mental peace. \n\nHealthy relationships do not work that way.\n\nYTA\nBut if you learn here, work on yourself, you won't be next time this happens.\n\nI'd make a genuine apology and explain.\nOtherwise next time he may not open up to you at all because he knows you don't respect his boundaries or care enough about his pain.", "Bro, on top of all that, you can't even use the correct you're?
