OP, it's literally not important that you have this information and he may be ashamed of what his subconscious conjured up and doesn't want to talk about it with you while the feelings are still raw. Right now he wants comfort - give it to him.", "Exactly this, my partner has bad dreams/nightmares often. Sometimes he's comfortable enough to tell me about it immediately, sometimes he asks for space to process it. D'ya know what I do? Respect what he wants in the moment. I know if he says he'll tell me later, I'll wait til later to hear about it. If he's visibly shaken, I'll ask him for footnotes, and he might tell me, if not, it's a hug and \"no bother loveen, want a cuppa coffee and snuggy?\" and we have coffee and a snuggy. It's as easy as that.", "there was also nothing in particular to deal with!  like deal with what head on? a dream?! lol like your man probably didn't see it necessary given that it was made up squiggles in sleeping brain...just I've got some bad feels like snuggle and go back to sleep\n\nYTA", "Such a great way to phrase it.

Like let them man snuggle up and go back to sleep.", "what", "I think you're being unfair on the guy, some people dream very vividly and it definitely needs rationalising as you experience real emotion which has an effect, she has not given him the time to do that. I started having anxiety dreams when I became a parent, not going to describe them but the panic you wake with there is not something I'd wish on anybody, it's disorientating and it can live with you after the relief of realising you're awake has hit you. Being cheated on doesn't compare to what I sometimes dream, it's pretty irrelevant in fact but it's still a significant life event and if someone is experiencing that with the same lucidity I sometimes do then they need the time OP did not afford her partner, OP certainly does appear to be an insufferable AH.

I doubt it would even disturb your sleep that much just to do some cuddling and go back to snoozing.", "Strongly disagree, he said he needed comfort, and need is a necessity imo. I think most people would prefer to be woken up to comfort the person they love, then know that person was suffering in silence. My SO's need for comfort would be more important to me, than my sleep for a night. So needing comfort doesn't make the bf an ah.\n\nAlso no one is entitled to details you don't want to give.

He is not an ah for not sharing things he doesn't feel okay to share.", "What type of backwards thinking is that? \ud83d\udc80 Are you okay? What\u2019s the emergency in telling her a DREAM?\nHe can very much do that.

Dreams don\u2019t equal reality. And honestly I just don\u2019t understand what you mean when you say what does he have to hide? Because he didn\u2019t give every detail of a dream? Are we joking right now? He has nothing to hide, but that being said that doesn\u2019t mean he has to share every detail. That\u2019s like expecting your partner to tell you every detail of their day to day, it\u2019s toxic.
