Its insane. We were all pretty close through our pregnancies and all nine babies are buddies. My daughter literally shares a birthday with two cousins.\n\nSeven of the nine of us decided to try breastfeeding. Some found it easier than others, and I was pretty lucky. Four of us \"ebf\" and three combo feed.\n\nAs the babies turned six months I joked about celebrating (because its been hard as hell). My sister was really into the idea. I planned it, as the designated planner (and also the one with the most free time), and so it was set.\n\nMy sister made a few comments about it being such a needed reward, how breastfeeding is so hard, but also made a point of saying how adding formula is just so easy.\n\nTo be honest she's kind of on the outside of the group so I just thought it was her being insecure. \n\nEveryone was invited, one FF friend declined. \n\nWe had the party - it was good, more of a get together than a party, but it was fun. Towards the end my sister was in a bad mood. I asked her what was wrong, she got a little butthurt, and asked why invited my formula feeding friend & the three combo feeding friends. \n\nI explained that they are my friends, we are all talking about the struggles of parenting, and all bar one breastfeed and I wasn't going to exclude one friend.\n\nShe told me I was being pedantic, that its not as hard for other people and this was just supposed to be for us.\n\nShe left in a bad mood and I told the rest of our party what happened, all of which agreed she was being over dramatic and that the situation isn't that serious. Then we told our FF friend who wasn't present, who doesn't really like my sister at all, but agreed with her. It was a bit of a shock.\n\nShe said that my sister was right and I probably made her feel pushed out and uncomfortable, unable to express her real feelings with them there.\n\nI'm not sure. I feel like I would have done wrong regardless of how I did it, but I'm not sure who's way would have been more asshole-ish.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1700568664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180fjn1/aita_for_throwing_a_breastfeeding_party_and_not/", "score": 1853, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why invent new ways to torture each other and yourselves? Is life not hard enough?", "Eh, I get that the moms want to socialize and chat/ vent... But the whole idea is kind of weird. \n\nI breastfed my kids and was always so grateful it worked out because the sterilizing of bottles and equipment, needing to run out and plan for formula, etc always seemed rougher. There were learning curves and \"getting used to it\", but finding what works best can be different for everyone. \n\nJust call it a 'Moms Group' and move on with it, without needing to gold- or silve -medal the feeding style.

The way to nourish an infant is a deeply personal but hopefully well-informed choice. Most mothers would like to give their babies what they believe is best. As much as I believe moms should be able to breastfeed in public, I also believe we should not shame moms who choose a different method of providing nourishment. What matters is that their babies are getting cared for and are thriving. And the same way that non-BF moms will not understand the struggles of breastfeeding, BF moms will not understand the challenges that FF moms faced and are facing. But that's just one of many challenges of motherhood and every new mom needs a good social support, regardless of how they feed their babies. \n\nI think NTA but maybe it would have been better if it was framed as a celebration of motherhood and overcoming the first 6 months rather than a BF party.\n\n>we are all talking about the struggles of parenting\n\nI really hope this was the focus rather than just BF itself so no one felt left out.", "The level of immaturity here really makes me doubt the veracity.

Motherhood is hard. I combie fed because my daughter wasn't getting enough from me and I didn't want her to starve. So I'm a bit biast thinking your sister overreacted and is possibly a dick. There are many reasons people don't breastfeed and yes it is difficult and demanding. I have 1 friend who tried to breastfeed but couldn't because it made her daughter unwell. Her second daughter solely breastfeed. However i think she might just need a bit of educating as formula feeding isn't the easy option for some. I personally found breastfeeding easier as I didn't have as much Washing up and sterilising. But I know that isn't the case for some especially if they are biters.

But why on earth does it matter how these babies are fed, as long as they're being fed enough to grow and be healthy? \n\nI was fortunate to exclusively breast feed my child until she was six months old, and to continue nursing her until she was 18 months. I did this because it was *easy*. No bottles to wash, mix, measure. Nothing to buy. Breastfeeding is really hard for some people, and really easy for others. Same goes for formula feeding...it's expensive, there are lots of logistics to consider, you could make your child very very sick if you mishandle the milk/bottles, but anyone can do it and you don't have to worry about your baby biting YOUR nipple while they're eating.\n\nI'm going to say YTA for making this about how the babies are fed. You need all of the help and support you can get when your kiddo is that young, and creating unnecessary divisions over how other people choose to feed their babies seems ridiculous to me.", "So with my first baby I pumped the breast milk and gave it to her in a bottle.

I felt like I was failing, like I was ruining my baby and was a terrible mother. I sat on the floor of the store and cried.\n\nIt was because of crap like this. Nevermind that my baby was having a severe medical crisis, we were literally driving from one doctor to the next and stopped for the formula per the first doctor's recommendation (which was, specifically \"whatever is cheapest, Costco if you can, because they are all the same and heavily regulated\".) We had already struggled, brought in consultants, gone to classes and spent hours trying to get a good latch - all before we knew she was actually incredibly sick. The stress that I was under as we were dealing with life or death decisions with a 2 month old brought my milk production to a standstill.  I didn't stop - I used hospital pumps while my baby was in the PICU; there was a closet with a pump that all the pumping moms shared (with our own parts). I had to wait in line in a hallway, away from my baby, for my turn, and hand over whatever I collected to nurses who stored it for me. Then, they had a rolling pump that was shared between several moms in another department; the other PICU babies had RSV, and passing the pump from them to me gave my baby RSV, which delayed her next medical procedure and put her through a lot more.\n\nAnd then, I fought a feeding tube for a year. She needed it, but I didn't want to fail at my most basic human role of feeding my child. She had an NG tube for a year before finally getting a gtube. It was so much easier, so much more comfortable for her. I wish I hadn't waited so long. \n\nFed babies are healthy babies. Breast, formula, exclusive pumped, scheduled, on demand, tube, IV, organic, WIC - whatever the mom and baby need, if the baby is fed and growing, then it's the right thing and no one else needs to give their input.

Its insane. We were all pretty close through our pregnancies and all nine babies are buddies. My daughter literally shares a birthday with two cousins.\n\nSeven of the nine of us decided to try breastfeeding. Some found it easier than others, and I was pretty lucky. Four of us \"ebf\" and three combo feed.\n\nAs the babies turned six months I joked about celebrating (because its been hard as hell). My sister was really into the idea. I planned it, as the designated planner (and also the one with the most free time), and so it was set.\n\nMy sister made a few comments about it being such a needed reward, how breastfeeding is so hard, but also made a point of saying how adding formula is just so easy.\n\nTo be honest she's kind of on the outside of the group so I just thought it was her being insecure. \n\nEveryone was invited, one FF friend declined. \n\nWe had the party - it was good, more of a get together than a party, but it was fun. Towards the end my sister was in a bad mood. I asked her what was wrong, she got a little butthurt, and asked why invited my formula feeding friend & the three combo feeding friends. \n\nI explained that they are my friends, we are all talking about the struggles of parenting, and all bar one breastfeed and I wasn't going to exclude one friend.\n\nShe told me I was being pedantic, that its not as hard for other people and this was just supposed to be for us.\n\nShe left in a bad mood and I told the rest of our party what happened, all of which agreed she was being over dramatic and that the situation isn't that serious. Then we told our FF friend who wasn't present, who doesn't really like my sister at all, but agreed with her. It was a bit of a shock.\n\nShe said that my sister was right and I probably made her feel pushed out and uncomfortable, unable to express her real feelings with them there.\n\nI'm not sure. I feel like I would have done wrong regardless of how I did it, but I'm not sure who's way would have been more asshole-ish.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am not logged as EBF in my kids log book as I express and dad gives him a bottle maybe twice a week! But that might vary depending on where you live. It was EBF until his 3 month weigh in and now its just BF!", "My first pediatrician told me if failed since I had to have an emergency c-section after 16 hours of labor. I got a new pediatrician after that.", "My mom is an old school OB/GYN nurse, she delivered babies for literally decades. She always says \"they don't give out medals for not having the drugs\". I asked for them the second i walked into my room lol", "That's ridiculous, it's not like something that under your control? I hate the \"one-downers\" who always have it worse and like that's something to admire", "My one and only was 9 hours from water breaking to delivery, and was slowed down by the epidural, so I can only imagine if it hadn't been.", "Women seem to do this more often than men tbh. My husband's friend group has single men, married men, men with and without kids, men in a broad spectrum of ages. My friend group is like married childless women, 30-39. When someone gets pregnant they move onto a mommy group. It's weird. It's not by my choice that I'm getting dropped like that, but we just get dropped when someone gets pregnant and single women don't want to hang out with us because we're \"boring\" lol. It does not necessarily surprise me that all her friends are in the same stage of life but the fact that it's SO synchronized makes me think there isn't much difference of opinion tolerated here. \n\nAnyway I started going to a drop-in knitting group and suddenly I had friends ages 19-83 from all life stages and family statuses and it was crazy to me at first but I love it- people don't do well in echo chambers.", "Okay, now that sounds like a great idea.", "Right? I'm all for celebrating  a  6 months keeping a baby alive party and I can even get behind the light joke of it being a breastfeeding party,  but to push another new mom away is so discouraging. You should be celebrating how hard ALL of ot can be, not just the feeding but all aspects of a newborn. I wonder how the sister will react to a \"only babies that are walking\" or \"only babies that are talking\" party and she's excluded. In the end, it's all relative in the early stages. I'd guess the sister is a first time mom.", "See I guessed it meant \u201ceverything but formula\u201d close enough lol", "Isn't free feeding when you keep dry food in your dog's dish all the time and they just eat when they want?", "I thought it was Family Friend!", "As a mom who\u2019s been on mommy boards and as someone who is LGBT+, this is the funniest thread ever lol.", "TIL \ud83d\ude02", "Lol saaaame!! It took me way too long to figure it out", "lol i also had that once. so many comments saying FTM and i googled and the result was female to male and i was very confused", "I would absolutely use 1TM instead of FTM if it were me, lol", "Here I\u2019ve been in the parenting Reddits thinking there\u2019s an abnormal amount of trans parents struggling \ud83d\ude2d", "WHAT. I swear to god I thought I was just reading a disproportionate amount of posts from transgendered parents\u2026.", "My thoughts went to fanfiction or Fantastic Four...\n\nMeanwhile, CBT is heavily context dependent.", "You're right, cis is short-hand and not an acronym. \n\nI spent a long time as a software developer and got used to all sorts of acronyms and words only existing in that world.", "Oh I know, when my youngest was born 9 weeks prem by emergency (trafitional/classic) c-section at 4:30 in the morning. \n\nI got a lot of attention from every direction and put in a single room. The other mums complained that I didn't have to share a room and I didn't even have a baby who was going to be woken up by the other babies. Other people were looking after my baby and I was still getting the most attention. The fact I had a wound from belly button to pelvic bone and badly bruised skin down both sides of my ribs, didn't seem to matter.", "As a goat owner who frequents goat related groups, it means first freshener, as in a goat who is having her first babies.", "The only thing I could come up with was fake friend\u2026 which made sense when she turned on OP and slides with the sister \ud83e\udd23", "Agreed! Lol", "You think every woman should default to quitting their job when having their first child? That should definitely not be the case for such a personal decision. Unless you mean it in the generalized sense that moms are always moms even when working and are therefore full time.", "In r/serverlife we occasionally get lost Redditors who ask very detailed computer questions.", "On the other end of it, I got called a bigot once for using the word tranny in a conversation specifically about car transmissions 3 or 4 years ago.", "Sometimes, confusingly, people do use it for approximately that. They'll say \"my 14 month old is EBF and we're having this problem...\" and a bunch of replies will be like, \"at that age they should also be having food!\" and the OP will say, \"they have food, but I'm still BFing them!\"\n\nIt's like the \"exclusively\" has gone over their heads.", "What assholes. Like you wouldn\u2019t have traded in a second to be in a shared room holding your baby who was awoken by another baby. Here we put nicu moms on the antipartum unit so they don\u2019t have to listen to all the babies cry while they are missing theirs.", "What's Lol?   /s  \ud83d\ude01", "Yes and CBT is only used to describe a therapy methodology.", "full time mom and stay-at-home mom seem like different concepts to me.  I could see noting a different between a full time mom and one who shares custody and only has kids with her part of the time.", "show me on the doll where I said that. I just meant once you're a mom, you're a mom.. unless you are some weird ass detached, don't care about your kids mom.  Even if you are divorced, you're still their mom.  Even when I am at work, I am still a mom.", "It's why we have single rooms on the wards, so mums who don't have their babies with them aren't surrounded by babies. \nIt also helps with older siblings, mine were almost 2, 4 and almost 7 and it gave us chance to sit and explain everything about scbu, before they saw him.", "At the risk of sounding like the ww I am, I kept misreading BLM as the part of the federal government that owns most of my state.", "Also I\u2019ve heard it referred to Skip The Dish. One friend asked their partner \u201chey, wanna get some STD\u2019s?\u201d \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Better to use STI's for the other meaning \ud83d\ude02 it always makes me laugh, because in Danish the word \"sti\" means path or walkway (unpaved) \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Hahahahahahah I've never heard that and I would never think of \"save the date\".", "Okay so you do mean in the general/technically correct sense! When folks say \u201cI\u2019m a full time mom\u201d they mean that being a mom is their full time job and they don\u2019t work outside of the home (like in response to \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d when making small talk). I think it\u2019s a poor use of the phrase, since I agree all moms are full time even if they work, but that\u2019s not what the phrase means when you hear it out in the world."]}
