{"id": 17075, "submission_id": "13fm233", "title": "AITA for not paying my mortgage?", "selftext": "Aita for not paying more towards the household?\n\n\nBackground: I 35f have been married to my husband 47m for 6 years. He has 2 children from a previous marriage and we have a 4 year old together as well. I had no children going into the marriage. We live in his house that he bought before we got together.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen we married, I signed a strict prenuptial agreement- what's his is his and what's mine is mine. We don\u2019t combine any assets at any time, even after death. We both have good full time jobs and I make close to $100k per year while my husband makes significantly more than I do at $400k per year.\n\n\nBecause he makes more money than me, his job takes priority leaving me to take care of the household in addition to my job. I do the child care for all 3 kids: taking them where they need to go everyday- school (they all go to a different school), sports, doctor appointments, etc; pack their lunches; get them dressed; keep them entertained and from distracting my husband (he works from home); and bedtime. I also do all the household errands from picking up prescriptions and dry cleaning, to handling the car maintenance (oil changes, smog checks, etc.) in addition to being the only one who picks up and cleans the house. With the house maintenance and the kids all doing different activities, my career has taken a hit because of all the time spent away from work.\n\n\nTo the point: My husband pays for his house and the associated costs (mortgage, landscaping, pool maintenance, etc), the cars (including insurance), groceries, vacations, and usually any meals out/ fun family activities. He splits sports costs with his ex for their 2 kids, and we split sports costs for our child. All 3 are very involved with sports, so those costs are high.\n\n\nI pay for all of our daughters' private school costs, about $25k per year. I pay for the gas for the cars, the maid service (they clean every other week, but they don\u2019t pick up rooms or do laundry or dishes), and health insurance for all 5 of us. I pay for ALL of my own costs as well as my daughters (clothes, medical costs, etc.). He wants me to look a certain way, so I get things like botox and fillers and nice clothes so that I can look like a partners\u2019 wife and I pay for all of that. I also am paying much higher taxes every year because of his higher tax bracket, even though we have separate assets due to the pre-nup.\n\n\nHe believes I should contribute more financially because he pays for the house. He owned this house before I moved in and it is his asset separate from me. I have no equity in it and if anything happens, I have to vacate the home. I think that I don't owe anything because I contribute more than my fair share by handling everything with the kids and home, which makes my career suffer and his flourish, and I still pay for a significant amount of things related to the family and the household.\n\n\nSo aita for not wanting to pay more? Or am I that out of touch and missing something?", "created_utc": 1683900042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fm233/aita_for_not_paying_my_mortgage/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So why pay into it?  Nah", "NTA.  In fact, you seem more like a housekeeper and nanny who sleeps with the boss, rather than a wife.

In most states even with a prenup, if you \"comingle\" your funds in such a manner that you're married and you're contributing to the mortgage, you may have a claim on part of the house in event of divorce.  Perhaps that's something to look into. If it's set up as \"rent\" you won't but if you can show you paid some of the mortgage it works in your favor.

That doesn't mean it couldn't happen, or that a couple would be wrong if they chose to do it that way, but it does mean that you didn't sign up under that expectation and have no obligation to follow it.\n\nIf he doesn't like the current situation, he can offer to renegotiate.  He can offer you something equal in value to what he is asking.\n\nThe Veruca Salt argument \"because I want it\" doesn't actually have any legal force.  You made a deal with contracts and pretty complicated ones.  If he wants to renegotiate the contracts, you bring in your lawyers and accountants to do so.

If he insists on this, you need to insist on him either scrapping or revising the prenuptial agreement. \n\nAs you suspect, it sounds very much like he is trying to drain your finances so much that you will not have the option to leave him despite your high salary.

It sounds like you contribute plenty, and I 100% agree that you should not be paying into a home that you will never have equity in. It's his asset, so it's his responsibility to pay for and maintain. I also think that you're paying a significant amount towards your daughter's schooling, and I feel like that should be split evenly the same way you split the sport costs. 25k a year is a quarter of your salary towards education. I feel like if he wants you to contribute financially to other things, you should tell him you'll only split things like groceries, car insurance, and other non-house related bills if he splits the education cost. \n\nAlso, it really seems like he doesn't appreciate the amount of work you do in running the household and caring for the kids. You could also tell him that if he wants you to contribute more, he needs to hire a nanny out of his salary so you can focus on your career and earn a higher salary to contribute. The amount of work you are doing around the house and with the kids should not be overlooked as a small thing. It's one of the reasons why alimony exists, and is granted to ex-wives who split from higher earning husbands. If you're putting your career on hold to raise the kids and hold down the fort, you deserve to be compensated for your time and effort. I don't think he appreciates the work you do around the house.", "If you divorced, he\u2019d be paying half of your daughter\u2019s school and activities and more because he\u2019d need a nanny to do all that you do for ALL of the kids.

Then I got pregnant, and had a high risk pregnancy, so I took some time off of work (like 1.5 years). During that time he paid for all the family expenses and I stopped paying anything monthly.  I still paid for my own expenses from my savings. Then when my daughter was a year (3 years ago) I rejoined the work force making about $65k per year, plus bonus, about $70-$75k in total. When I started working, I couldn't stay home with my daughter anymore so I put her in a private school because her education and care was important to me. I also started paying all her expenses because I was always the one taking care of her, if I took her to a doctor appointment,  then I paid the bill. He wanted me to pay additional money on top of what I was paying and I refused, so I just kept paying for her school and expenses as well as my own and it has been that way since.

He can pay his own bills, thank you.\n I don't understand why he isn't paying for all of the children's expenses, too.", "NTA you need to entirely stop doing anything for anyone besides you and your daughter and focus on your career. His kids have 2 parents they can sort out their sports, laundry, food. He is an adult he can sort out his car, laundry, food. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to divorce to quit this ridiculous job and charade. \n\nSeriously stop!", "NTA. Please see a good family law attorney. I can\u2019t see how this marriage is remotely worth saving. Your husband treats you like crap. He is financially and emotionally abusing you. If he\u2019s cheated in the past he will likely cheat again.  You need to get out. \n\nPlease talk to a hotline for abuse survivors about making a plan to leave safely. Part of this plan will include not having a conversation about leaving, just doing it. You don\u2019t want him manipulating you into changing your mind (and then him taking action to make leaving more difficult).", "NTA about not paying more, but you are an AH to yourself for putting up with this man who clearly doesn't really care. Not about you or your child. You need to realized what you wrote sounds like all you are to him is free maid and child care. It souns like you are also eye candy eith \"he wants me yo look a certain way\" that he makes you pay for. If he wants you to have nice clothes he should be buying them! Also don't forget all the money you save him buy paying all those bills he doesn't.  You're already a single parent. Move on.", "It sounds like you spend more time with his kids than he does because you're doing all the house work and child care. For that alone, NTA. If he wants you to pay more of the mortgage or rent, then he should step it up with his children and lessen your load. Just because you make less doesn't make you any less valuable to the family.", "NTA. Your husband sounds like a very selfish man.", "NTA. You are being used. Start interviewing the most aggressive family lawyers you can find, because he will ambush divorce as soon as he has extracted all the value he perceives in you. He will want a more controllable model in 5 or 10 years.", "OP. I feel sad for you. Your life seems transactional. NTA . You deserve better. He doesn\u2019t value you like he should.", "Your husband is gaslighting you and is financially abusive. He wants all the benefits of having a wife, but none of the financial or personal cost/investment. He's using you as free childcare/escort service... and not only is he getting these services for free, but he's hurting your career long term. \n\nYour husband is dead weight, you'd be better off just you and your daughter. Get out.\n\nNTA\n\n---\n\nPSA If you do end up divorcing him, make sure you get **your** lawyer, not a \"friend of a friend\" or some bullshit. If you have to, pay more to get someone someone who isn't local. Ideally you know of a lawyer who hates your husband and wants to ruin him (I'm sure he's pissed more than a few people off over the years).", "Nta, but bifbhe doesn't drop it I suggest you ask for compensation for providing care for his 2 kids and also request that he pays your n ileage for the errands you run to maintain his  house", "This is financial abuse. You need a good lawyer, but dont tell him that you are looking for one. He sounds like a master manipulator.\n\nIf you want to stay with him, make a spreadsheet with all your contributions and put a $ figure for your labor. You will realize how much you are being exploited.", "NTA it sounds like you and your daughter would be better off with out him. It may be time to rethink this relationship.\n\nBecause all you are to him is a trophy, maid, and bang nanny for his kids.", "NTA seriously your husband sounds awful he basically does everything a bad husband would do except actually best you.\n\nStop doing any work for anyone other than you and your daughter. Focus on your career. Pay for Nothing to him. Also no he can\u2019t legally kick you out, and stopping you from leaving is kidnappings \n\nIf you live in a one party recording state start recording him. Start a diary accounting every event and conversation. Speak to a lawyer for advice on what to do even if you don\u2019t leave so you\u2019re protected against his onslaught of drowning you In lawyers fees", "NTA.  Why does he pay towards his other kids but doesn't pay ANYTHING towards her school or other costs associated with the child you share together. \n\n If you lived separate from him at least he would have to pay child support for your daughter and contribute to her school cost.  Will you have to pay for her college cost alone or will he contribute to that.\nThe way it is now he pays nothing towards your daughter's upkeep.\n\nThe mortgage is less important than understanding why he feels no financial responsibility towards the child you share rogether.", "Wow, you're really getting screwed over here.", "Thank you for taking the time to respond. He will never revise the prenup because our Relationship is so often difficult. So I think this is headed towards escape.", "TY. He believes I need to contribute a lot because I would have these expenses if I were elsewhere and I increase expenses in the home like gas, electric, wear and tear on all items, etc. But I don't believe I really Increase those expenses, he already lives there and works from home time. I just got stuck in this situation and I don't know how to undo it all, there is no negotiating with him. He talks circles around me, and I get it, he litigates a lot so he is good at this kind of thing but I am not. So I end up just staying silent.", "I wish it were that simple.  He will go on a tirade endlessly until I do what he wants. He eventually starts screaming in my face and calling me names in front of the kids and I usually cave so that they don't have to see that anymore. He will tell me I am being selfish and a terrible parent and partner.", "I will do that, honestly these independent opinions are very helpful. I did try leaving earlier this year, and at first he became very angry and he took all the keys to the cars and said I could leave but I wouldn't be going in any of the cars because they are his. Then he agreed to give me keys to one car and let me go but made me sign a piece of paper saying that the car was his because the car was actually in my name. I signed just so I could go. He said he would not let my daughter out of the house without a court order. I was scared and went back. I thought for some reason we could work out our financial disagreements and disagreements about household duties/childcare/respectful interactions,  but nothing has changed. The reason I made this post at this time is because I got a job promotion yesterday, and my new salary is 92,500 plus bonus (which isnt looking good this year), it was lower before, and I know he is about to ask me for more money and it will be a big fight so I wanted to know what people thought about all this. Thank you so much for taking the time to comment. I am grateful.", "Thank you. I just always thought all marriages are hard and require a lot of compromise.  So I should just keep compromising, keep trying. But the gist I am getting from everyone is that this isn't normal marriage stuff.", "So why are you married to him? \n\nYou guys earn 500k a year, haven't paid off the house yet despite him being there for at least 8 years and somehow can't even bring yourself to share finances", "OP, start charging him per hour for childcare, cleaning, and cooking. Hand him a bill. Let him know if you weren't together, he'd be paying you for all those things. If he doesn't want to, maybe it's time you stop doing all those things. You can just care for your child. Tell him to hire someone for the other kids.", "Umm, Yeah, thats fine. Pay him rent. And in turn charge him for babysitting, driving the kids around, cleaning his house, washing his clothes,1/2 of your daughters expenses. chef charges too. Keep adding to the list..He will regret his new debts.", "I'm sorry to hear that. As secretly as possible please be sure to consult with an attorney and an organization that helps abused women. They would be the best able to advise you on protecting your and your child's financial and physical wellbeing. Good luck.", "Maybe start filming him openly? Unless you\u2019re worried that will make him physically violent, if it does he is being recorded maybe? \n\nIf you were a terrible parent and partner he would leave you. He is the terrible parent or partner.", "I am sorry for what is happening to you he is abusing you in every way possible to make you stay and look after his kids. Please get out of this situation and keep is updated I will subscribe to this post and i would like to know that your going to be ok and safe \u2764\ufe0f", "When he wouldn\u2019t let you leave in a car in your name that is legally kidnapping. As a litigator he will know that. He only wants to take your money to control you and limit your options when you leave. \n\nStop taking care of anyone and anything that isn\u2019t directly you and your daughter. Move all legal documents for you and your daughter to a safe neutral location. Drop everyone from your insurance unless he forks over all the money you\u2019ve spent on it and he has profited on.", "You know, that paper you signed would never hold up in court. Please talk to a support hotline about how to leave. You probably know that abusers escalate when they think you are going to leave so you will need to learn how to make a plan. Please take care of yourself.", "Marriages do require compromise ( I\u2019ve been married 22 yrs) but on both sides. Your husband should want the mother of his child to be comfortable, secure in case something happened to him and to treat you fairly financially. \n\nGood luck.", "In those moments I just try to shrink and be small, I am quiet and try not to make it worse. I always tell myself \"next time I will remember to pull out my phone and hit record \", and then the time comes and I don't. I am not sure why this happens. Ty for the suggestion. I know it's a good one. If I can make it happen lol.", "I will, thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f", "If everything people in a family just do then someone besides you can do it all!", "Go back to the lawyer who refused to support your prenup", "If you\u2019re such a crazy horrible wife why won\u2019t he let you leave? Why doesn\u2019t he lead you?", "Growing up I had a horrible controlling step mom in my teen years. As a step parent, I vowed never to do that. So with the older kids, I try not to make them do things because I don't want to fight with them and have a bad relationship. So I ask them to help clean,  but they frequently don't. And my 4 year old makes chaotic messes for obvious reasons. And my husband says his back hurts too much to help. So I end up cleaning/tidying for everyone. I don't know how to get out of this other than to move out at this point \ud83d\ude15", "I actually did try. I spent $1200 consulting with him. After he declined,  my husband had me write a pretty nasty legal letter asking for my money back. I regret letting him send that. I don't blame that guy for not wanting to be involved.  I will look for another. Ty for the advice though, if my husband hadn't had me burn that bridge it would have been a great one.", "I have been thinking about your last line all day \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 you're right though,  I do try to reason with him and eventually give up. He has more arguing stamina than I do.", "He says nobody would ever love me but him. I know this isn't true. I have no idea why he won't let me leave. I have frequently wished he would have an affair and let me move on.", "I will admit I don't know much about getting divorced, but u would think that with a pre- number it would be pretty cut and dry. The only thing that could be complicated is custody.", "And take his children off your insurance. That is crazy. They have two parents to pay for that.\n\nHe and his ex-wife are making money off of you. Stop paying for anything.\n\nBut first, get a lawyer.", "Yes I agree, but that is where I think he will fight me. Many years ago, before my daughter was born, I had a mental breakdown because I felt so bad about everything that was happening at home. I am talking like 72 hour suicide hold kind of deal. My family came and tried to take me away, but my husband said if I went with them we were over. And I was very fragile and felt like I just needed to be better and work harder. So I stayed. I got some counseling, then stopped. I would never let that happen again now that my daughter is here, but i worry he will use that past as a way to try to take custody from me, or at least fight me on it.", "I will look for one this weekend. His ex wife actually pays him for her portion of the health insurance. His company ALSO pays him for his portion of the health insurance. He does not give me either of those funds. So he actually profits money from me paying for the health insurance. I mean that sounds so crazy when I write that down lol.", "Cut back on your spending immediately and start saving. Get the maid in more often and have them take on meal prep and additional duties, so you can be more solid at work.\nYou have a wonderful life ahead of you, once his is in your rear view mirror. Start making notes of his threats and belittling behavior. Child support should be a real eye opener for him.", "Divorce his ass and get some juicy child support, try and document everything he says like that too", "If I was him and what he has said to you in regards to divorce and child custody fight -it looks like he is financially draining you so you don\u2019t have the financial means to leave. Stand your ground, start by reducing the maid duties and child care for his children and it will help you grasp your situation. Don\u2019t doubt yourself, follow through and maybe use same words he uses against you. I know it isn\u2019t as simple but I true wish you see your worth. \ud83d\udc9c", "Umm you need to tell him pay you all the back money he has been paid for the insurance or you are going to drop all of them off of your policy. That is CRAZY!", "It almost sounds like you'd get decent support from for co-parent, aka ex-wife, regarding leaving since she's already been there.", "I don't want to falsely portray anything, he doesn't ask me to do any of it, he just says mean things about the way I look so that I go and get it fixed. I was not raised this way. My father was a wonderful father and partner to my mother. Never abusive. Always supported her. And my mother was never into looks, she has never had botox or fillers or any cosmetic procedures.  They never even argued in front of us. I don't know how I ended up here. I appreciate your input though,  makes me think back about the inappropriate nature of it all.", "I mean, yes, I am genuinely afraid, I don't think he will hit me but he screams in my face and refuses to get out of my physical space. I know he is hoping I will hit him, but I won't. And he will try to trap me so that it's really hard to get away. And I worry that he will say false things about me.", "Thank you thank you. I haven't told many people about what has been happening,  so I really wasn't sure what people would think. I feel like I know what I need to do now, I just need to find the courage to leave.", "She has been very supportive. She worries for her children if I leave, because he can be verbally and emotionally abusive and I usually protect the kids from that. I worry about all 3 for that reason as well."]}
