They have told Michael during custody exchanges that it would be \u201cbest if you left, nobody likes you, and you\u2019ll never be Troy\u2019s real dad.\u201d They\u2019ve made comments about my appearance, my job, my profession, etc- all in front of Troy. It came to a head in 2021 when Troy said that during every Sunday supper they have with Gregs parents (which is every other Sunday) his mom, Susan, would turn it into the I Hate Taco Hour. With everyone at the table, Susan would start in on what a fat cow I am, how I\u2019m a stupid bitch, a horrible mother, etc. Troy & Greg participated in this, laughed at her cruel jokes, and did nothing to stop it. I have made it a point to never speak ill of Greg or his family to Troy. \n\nLast night at dinner, Troy said that he\u2019s been having issues with a classmate. He didn\u2019t tell me because he hoped by ignoring it, it would go away. After much back and forth I told him to talk to someone at school, or I would.\n\nTroy exploded and screamed \u201cWHY CAN\u2019T YOU BE LIKE DAD? HE LETS ME FIGHT MY OWN BATTLES! YOU DON\u2019T LOVE ME! IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULD LET ME FIGHT! I HATE YOU!\u201d\n\nI responded\u2026poorly, in hindsight. I told him, \u201cYour dad not doing anything when his kid is being bullied is not what a good parent does! Ignoring this will not work. And don\u2019t you ever say I don\u2019t love you ever again. I went hungry so you could eat, whereas YOU sat there and made jokes calling your own mother a \u201cfat bitch\u201d. I know you hate me, it\u2019s obvious.\u201d\n\nI got up and left for a walk. I know I responded really badly, but I have had it with being his punching bag. Troy is a good kid, but he\u2019s got a mean streak to him, and I am his target. I collect vintage owl figures, and any time he sees a new one, he makes a snide remark. (I don\u2019t have a ton, but if I see one at a thrift store I like, I\u2019ll pick it up. The owls are in my office, where nobody but me sees them.) Troy does not want for anything, mind you. My favorite color is emerald green, and so my bedroom is decorated in lots of emerald green & velvet. He made yet another snotty remark. If I forget something, he\u2019ll reply with, \u201cAnd to think, you graduated the top of your class. Must\u2019ve cheated or something.\u201d \n\nWhen I came home, Troy wanted to talk. He told me that he and his friends show affection by giving them shit, and that\u2019s all he knows. He apologized for \u201cflipping me shit\u201d and said he loves me. I told him, \u201cI don\u2019t accept your apology. You are very cruel on purpose, and if you loved me, you wouldn\u2019t spend hours with Susan calling me a stupid, fat bitch, week after week. That isn\u2019t love, that is pure hatred. Now go get ready for bed.\u201d Troy walked off, and this morning hasn\u2019t said a word to me. I\u2019m wondering if I took things too far, and maybe I owe him a massive apology.", "created_utc": 1682737528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132hmsn/aita_for_not_accepting_my_sons_16m_apology_after/", "score": 673, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to learn that actions have consequences before he does this to the wrong person who won't tolerate his form of \"affection\".\n\nAlso, this is why we have shitty adults because we excuse their behavior as teens. \n\nHe needs to learn that sometimes, an apology isn't enough.", "NTA. It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of emotional abuse from your ex-husband and his family, and it's not fair for Troy to take out his frustrations on you. It's understandable that you reacted poorly in the moment, but it's important to have a conversation with Troy and explain why his behavior is hurtful. It's also important for him to understand that showing affection by giving someone shit is not an excuse for being cruel. It's okay to not accept his apology right away and take some time to process your feelings, but eventually, it's important to work towards forgiveness and healing. However, it's also important for Troy to take responsibility for his actions and work towards changing his behavior.", "ESH. \n\nI understand that he\u2019s young and pushing boundaries, but actions carry consequences. It\u2019s unreasonable to repeatedly take jabs and think you\u2019ll just take it. You\u2019re only human, and he\u2019s old enough to work on this.\n\nYour response to his \u201capology\u201d was a jab at him, though, and you\u2019re still the adult. You\u2019re supposed to be modeling appropriate behavior. It would have been fair to tell him that an apology is meaningless without changing behavior, and you hope he can show, rather than tell, you he\u2019s sorry.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. Almost went E-S-H but as I wrote it I couldn't help but change my mind. With the way he treats you, I feel like you shouldn't have to just forgive it because he's your kid and he apologized. It's downright abusive. Teenagers can be extremely toxic towards their parents, especially when the other parent encourages it.\n\nYour son treats you like shit. It sounds like this was the straw that broke the camel's back and you responded in a less than ideal way. I think you didn't want to accept his apology because he was apologizing for a single incident when for you it was about a pattern of behaviour, which he has not apologized for and refuses to change.", "I was a shit kid and took it out on my mom because she was the one person who loved me unconditionally. Some harsh words about how I was messing with her emotionally were necessary at some points. Your kid is trying to excuse away his behavior saying his \"friends talk shit\" to express affection imo. I hope he grows out of this and you need to talk to him more about his behavior but NTA.", "NTA. The twice monthly exposure to the vile, nasty jokes and comments have poisoned his mind towards you. I highly recommend you get him into therapy.", "Hmm. NTA. This one's tough, but I don't think you did anything that bad. \n\nYou don't HAVE to accept anyone's apology, and your son is not a little kid anymore.\n\nIt might be good for him to see that a simple apology doesn't always fix things.\n\nYou didn't insult your son or say nasty things about him- a lot of parents do! I think being more firm with him and demanding he show you some respect might  be good for him. \n\nI know a lot of people are going to tell you to get family counseling, but honestly, it's not always helpful. There are a lot of well meaning but ultimately useless counselors out there. It can be very hard to find a good one. Whatever you decide, I wish you good luck. Teenagers truly suck.", "NTA\n\nHe's 16 and in therapy. This doesn't bode well I'm afraid. The anger and constant barrage of painting you as the scapegoat and inferior parent is well established in his mind. Yes, you are the parent but at the same time, there needs to be consequences for striking out at you the way he did. Telling you that he \"shows affection by giving shit\", saying he PREFERS to fight, the fact that he's actively participated in tearing you down along with his father's family is going to take a LOT to undo. You both need to be in therapy but your replay to him was actually valid.", "NTA. It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of emotional abuse from your ex-husband and his family, and it's understandable that you would be sensitive to your son's behavior towards you. While it's good that Troy apologized, it's also important for him to understand the impact of his actions and words on you. You have every right to set boundaries and expect respect from your son, and it's okay to not accept an apology if you don't feel it is sincere or if you need more time to process your feelings. It might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with Troy about how his behavior makes you feel and what you need from him moving forward.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is 16.\n\nYou might be the target now. But in a very short time, it will be his partner. \n\nHe will actively be emotionally and verbally abusive because he\u2019s been taught that is ok. And beyond ok, that it *is* how you treat the important people (particularly females if he straight) in your life.\n\nI\u2019m sickened reading this. He is long overdue for the lesson that an apology can\u2019t simply \u201cfix\u201d everything.", "Nta, parents are human too. We can only take so much hurt from our loved ones before something has to give. Unfortunately reddit thinks parents must be some kind of perfect being or else you're a terrible parent. Hopefully showing him raw hurt emotion rather than carefully put together sentences with the perfect tone amd infliction will knock a little sense into him that his words hurt. When everyone has calmed down enough talk to him explain to him that these things said are cruel and if he continues on through life saying mean hurtful things he will push everyone away. Him trying to play it off as a joke and just some good natured ribbing isn't cool jokes are only funny when both people find it so. Otherwise it's just being mean", "Troy, his father and his family are the biggest assholes here. Your initial response was not terrible. Troy needed to hear some of those things, but you should forgive him. Set the example of kindness and forgiveness because it doesn\u2019t sound like his father or his family are capable of teaching him that.\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s Something you can do with your custody agreement in regards to the time Troy spends with his father and family. If they are sabotaging your relationship with your son or being bad examples, perhaps you can have an attorney write a letter to Greg warning him that you will seek full custody if he continues to poison Troy. \nI had an attorney write a letter to my ex husband when he and his family were behaving similarly. The letter stated that I\u2019d go for full custody and get a court order to prohibit my children from seeing his family if their bad behavior continued. \nIn the meantime, you should have a heart to heart with Troy and tell him that his behavior hurts you and that you won\u2019t tolerate disrespect. \nEventually, Greg\u2019s behavior will backfire. Troy will grow up and see what you have done for him and how you never disrespected his father. The best advice someone gave me while I was going through this was to continue to be the bigger person. Good luck!", " NTA, but maybe it's time to accept the apology, lay down some boundaries, ask him how he plans to change his behavior,  and get some family therapy with both you and your son.", "NTA. You've been very patient with a boy much too old to be using the \"you don't love me\" card, and leagues too old for the \"how dare you not accept my apology the second I apologize\" card.  You did not owe him automatic forgiveness, especially when you've been turning the other cheek or so long. ~~Your ex and his family are so insanely lucky you haven't sued them for parental alienation yet, because that's absolutely what they're doing.~~\n\nThat said, you do need to have a serious sit down conversation with him about this and lay it all out for him- that you never say anything bad about his dad for a reason, that his constant negging at when you forget or collect things is wildly inappropriate and abusive, that constantly bad mouthing you to people that hate you is actively encouraging their hatred towards you, your body and looks are not something that a teenage boy needs to be looking at or talking about, and that affection through craptalking might seem fun in a vacuum, but if he ever has a SO they will break up with him for that.  \n\nIt might be a good idea to start calling out his shitty little comments to you- maybe an \"excuse me?\" or a \"I don't appreciate that, don't do it\". \n\nAlso, you mentioned airing out your issues with him with the therapist- that's a good idea. His therapist needs to know he's doing these things.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. Your ex-in-laws and ex-husband for obvious reasons. Troy can slightly be forgiven because most kids aren\u2019t going to go against the majority at a family gathering, especially if those people are adults. Couple that with the normal trying to fit in and find your place that comes with growing up, and he\u2019s going to struggle. You\u2019re only a slight AH here; as the verbal punching bag for my son, I understand that you can only take so much abuse before you break. You\u2019re only human, and you make mistakes. But you\u2019re also an adult, and a parent. It might help if you could have a therapy session where the two of you hash out some of these things with an unbiased mediator.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nThe reason it\u2019s not ESH is that you are the parent and need to provide unconditional love.\n\nIf you had said I accept your apology and I love you but your words were really painful and when you participate in your fathers harassment of me     that hurts me to and this type of behaviour needs to stop.\n\nYou need to build bridges not set them on fire.", "YTA.  He's a teenager and kids are often mean.  You were cruel towards him and his dad is a bully, where exactly is he supposed to learn to do better?  Maybe get him into therapy, talk to him about things, and work with him.  Sounds like he lives with a dad who the only way he gets acceptance is by participating in being mean towards you.  It isn't right, but you could work to empower him instead of condemning him.  When he apologized you two could have sit and talked.  You could have told him that, while you are glad he apologized, when he sits and listens and participates in others saying hateful things about you it is hard for you to believe that he cares.  Talk about actions and how we treat people we care for.  It sounds like he has missed a lot of those lessons.", "YTA\n\nYour son is 16 and a child of an apparently messy divorce. It's not his fault he's being taught poor behavior, but he obviously tried to make it better and apologise, but you wouldn't let him. I'm sorry you have to deal with  your ex's family, but it isn't your sons job to protect you from them. \n\nTalk to him about it.", "YTA. I mean, he's a teenager. He apologised in a very self aware way, which is way more than most teenagers would do. The best you could've done was accept it and have the conversation that you will not tolerate this kind of treatment from him.  \n\n\nI also don't know about the Susan remark because it might come across as you resenting him for spending time with his dad. Anything else that his dad's mom does is out of his control. Again, he's a teenager, he's not gonna tell his grandma to shut up. Maybe he's just laughing along to be polite.", "How do you know he goes along with dad's family comments? Also have you thought that maybe he goes along because he feels he doesn't have a choice? That he wants be part of his dad's life, and that's the price to pay?\n\nHe's 16, making remarks and answering back is his job. It's your job however to discipline him, and I don't mean punish him, but teach him how to behave. Your outburst sounds childish and guilt-tripping and your son was actually the mature one in this situation, wanting to talk and apologise, but yet again you played the victim. \n\nYour son already has a shitty half of the family, don't make it a whole.\n\nYTA", "YTA. he explained clearly why he\u2019s been the way he is and you responded by shutting down his vulnerability. what do you want from the kid? he tried to change his ways and you quickly just threw his past actions in his face.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I reacted very poorly", "The divorce was over and done with fairly quickly. We didn\u2019t have any property to argue over, and we both agreed at the outset to 50/50 custody. \n\nI got therapy during the divorce to help be a better parent to Troy, and to understand my role in a failed marriage. \n\nI wanted him to know that he can\u2019t just say \u201csorry\u201d and have everything be okay. I realize that I should\u2019ve probably said I need him to demonstrate changed behavior instead", "I really don't understand the comments treating this kid like he is 5 years old. He is sixteen. He should be responsible for his words. He is choosing to belittle his mother, to yell at her and makes the excuse of \"that's how I show affection to my friends\". If she just takes the apology and let's it go then he won't ever learn to take responsibility and grow up.", "I reacted like a snot. I was still smarting but you\u2019re right, I should\u2019ve been the adult in the room and accepted it. \n\nI truly don\u2019t resent his time spent with Greg. Overall, Greg isn\u2019t a bad parent. They work on cars together and they\u2019re always either at the racetrack or hunting. He just loathes me for divorcing him 15 years ago.", "Troy said that he often made jokes himself about me. When I told him how much it hurt he told me to stop controlling his free speech and grow a thicker skin about it. \n\nI ended up telling Greg to knock it off as it was super inappropriate to engage in this weekly roast, and that I\u2019ve made it a point to refrain from speaking ill of him to Troy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stopped, based off some other remarks Troy has said, but he won\u2019t tell me that", "I don't think it's fair to say that he was being vulnerable just because he apologized. A lot of kids will apologize just so their parents aren't mad anymore.", "I would like the behavior to fully stop. I\u2019ve been a punching bag for years. I\u2019ve told him that his words hurt before and he just doesn\u2019t change anything.", "Thank you for your feedback.", "Troy has asked in the past why it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nMy line for the last fifteen years has been, \u201cWe realized we were better off separated than together, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nGreg was an abusive ass. Plain and simple. But I refuse to lower myself to his level by bad mouthing his dad. I don\u2019t want to say, \u201cI left your dad because he was an abusive asshole who took it too far when he made a cruel \u2018joke\u2019 about Aunt Tara\u2019s breasts.\u201d", "I can guarantee that if Greg heard Troy speaking about Susan like he does about me, he would lose his shit. \n\nGreg is the \u201cfamily loyalty is everything\u201d type.", "Thank you for your feedback.\n\nI have made it clear to Troy that I love him, both in words and deed\u2019s throughout his entire life. \n\nHis father has talked shit about me for the last fifteen years, Troy has joined in and has continued to be cruel in my home. I have turned the other cheek so many times that my neck is twisted from all the rotations I\u2019ve done. \n\nTroy is turning into a young man. A young man who will date. He needs to know that just because you say he sorry doesn\u2019t mean the injured party is obligated to accept it, nor does it change the situation unless there is demonstrable change.", "Unfortunately, it's not working if he thinks it's ok to keep making crap comments towards you.", "Growing up in an abusive home \u2014 I know firsthand that as a kid you don\u2019t speak up when nasty things are being said, because all that cruelty will immediately tumble down on your head.   And then you\u2019ll be miserable.  \n\nThat\u2019s why Troy laughs along.   \n\nBut he will grow up and realize how messed up his father & extended family are.    Mark my words.", "OP, I was like your kid. I was very emotionally stunted and socially awkward, on top of coming from a family where emotions were just not expressed or dealt with. I started using jokes as my \u201clove language\u201d if you will because saying things like \u201cI love you/miss you/ appreciate you\u201d etc. was just unnatural and actually physically cringey for me. It started off harmless but got progressively meaner (not to the degree your son has taken it, but I definitely did hurt people), and it became my normal. I still struggle with it because it\u2019s what I default to. I wish someone called me out and taught me a different way of being when I was your son\u2019s age. Believe me when I say those moments are some of the biggest regrets in my life that keep me up at night. The fact that your son has that self-awareness is good and you have a chance to teach him better. Don\u2019t miss it!", "He\u2019s probably feeling a lot of pressure from his dad\u2019s family to behave like that. I do think you should have gone a little easier when he apologized. Something like \u201cThank you for apologizing but I am going to need to some time to get past this\u2026 the way you\u2019ve been treating me is not how we treat people we love, it\u2019s how we treat people we hate. I love you, but this hurt me deeply and it\u2019s going to hurt for awhile.\u201d And then when you\u2019ve calmed down a bit more, have a discussion with him about why he\u2019s treating you this way, and how he feels about the position his dad and stepmom have put him in.", "I'm 31 now and me and my mom are super close but I gave her a run for her money and it's embarrassing how awful I was from 15 to 17. Hopefully your son will feel the same. \n\nYou're doing your job and being a great mom. Keep doing what you're doing and the rest will be up to him. Hang in there op!", "Has he ever participated in a social skills group? That might be a good supplement to the therapy.", "Can you have a session with his therapist to fill them in on all the issues so the can help work through it.", "Well, I'm glad he has a counselor he trusts. That's important.", "Then maybe it\u2019s time to contact your attorney again about parental alienation.\n\nNTA", "\"We were just joking\" behavior is often pushed into abusive behavior. I won't say anything over your son, I see how hard you're trying here and he's only sixteen, but that might be something you need to note in your email to his therapist.", "Unless there is active harm being done, talking to the teacher will absolutely escalate things. Take it from someone who has experience with it. Right now Troy believes he can handle it. He confided in you and you threw that away by demanding he does something else. He is right, let him fight his own battles. Be there should he fail, but don\u2019t fight them for him.\n\nAnd yes the jokes is definitely a shitty thing, but he is also a teenager from a messy divorce with a shitty family on one side, and a manipulative sounding family on the other. It\u2019s something to work on, but the fight wasn\u2019t even about that. It was about you trying to force him to do something he doesn\u2019t want to and isn\u2019t necessary either. \n\nAnd you refusing his apology is even worse", "This is AITA.\n\nIt's uncommon for people to show compassion to adults when it comes to kids/teens.", "It depends if she wants a future relationship with him or not.  It sounds like she did.", "He said i hate you. The thing every single teenager on earth does at one point. Telling him to cut it out is fine, but guilting him as a response? Not okay", "I think my proposed response provided that balance of clearly explaining the behaviour was unacceptable, the damage that behaviour caused while still trying to repair the relationship.\n\nIf she wishes to not have a relationship with her son then I support your and her approach.", "And yet when he jumped over his ego and apologized you didn\u2019t accept it and threw his \"i love you\" back in his face. How is that grace?", "If they're having a hate fest every other Sunday dinner with you as the target it's **still** a messy divorce.\n\nYTA.", "I say \"messy divorce\" because of the after effects. Even if there was no money to deal with, your son has been growing up with half of his family saying horrible things about his mom and encouraging him to do the same. That's rough on a kid. It's rough on you too of course, but imagine it from his perspective, he probably feels like he has to constantly be taking sides between his parents. \n\nAnd to be clear, you acting imperfectly doesn't make you a bad parent. This stuff is rough and no one envies you. But continuing to learn better ways to communicate with your son is the move here.", "I think you are being too hard on yourself.", "Eh, parents are human too! But it\u2019s not too late to sit down and explain your side to him and how his recent behaviour has hurt you. Teenagers are mostly snots but if you converse with him like an adult about this, you\u2019ll only earn more of his respect.", "I understand why you did not do it while he was younger but now that he appears to have some of you ex traits it may be time to tell him the truth so he does not end up like your ex. \n\nAnd maybe he will understand why you reacted liked you did because your ex use to talk to you like that. \n\nMaybe the therapist can help you with this. \n\nJust curious did your ex every remarry or have a serious girlfriend.", "I think it\u2019s hard to get the message that \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about women/our exes/ our parents like this\u201d when half the family does it regularly. \n\nI am far from perfect but I have tried to uplift Greg and Susan. Every Christmas, I give Troy money to buy him a Christmas present, and I talk up genuinely positive things about Susan. For example she\u2019s a great cook, so I\u2019ll say something like \u201cMan I\u2019m jealous you got some of Gramma Susan\u2019s ham, I loved her ham!\u201d", "I hope when he grows up that it\u2019s simply unacceptable to talk about your previous romantic partners with such venom, all because they didn\u2019t stay in the relationship. \n\nI didn\u2019t cheat on Greg. He didn\u2019t cheat on me. I just couldn\u2019t tolerate his constant verbal abuse under the guise of jokes, and the final straw was when he made a very nasty remarks about my sisters breasts when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. \n\nProblem is, Greg is the fun parent. They work on cars at his garage, they go to the racetrack, they go hunting and fishing and have their little bachelor pad with pizza and steaks. I\u2019m the fuddy duddy one who tells him to walk the dog and pick up his laundry, and enforcing his curfew. We do fun things, don\u2019t get me wrong. But there\u2019s simply more structure and rules at my house.", "My father used to make occasional nasty remarks about my mother when I visited him. I always responded by saying that what he said was not true. But I am very confrontational and was even as a very young child.\n\nIn many cases the cruelty is directed at just one victim and everyone else is safe even if they express disagreement. Troy needs to grow a back bone and at least not join in.", "I had hoped that by Michael modeling emotions in the open, Troy would learn that it\u2019s okay. \n\nI don\u2019t expect him to give me a hug and a kiss (teenage boys are teenage boys, after all) nor do I expect him to say \u201cI love you, Mom!\u201d when I drop him off but I don\u2019t like being the constant butt of jokes or being on the receiving end of snotty remarks", "I think I\u2019d like to have that exact conversation with Troy while his therapist is present.", "I know his school has a ton of social clubs (everything from a cupcake club to rock climbing club) and while some are totally up his alley, he refuses to join. I don\u2019t want to force him", "I\u2019m going to request to sit in on his next session to discuss this behavior and this specific incident", "His counselor has been great in helping him overcome a lot of issues, and knowing that that office is a 100% safe and judgment free zone has really helped", "I may have to. \n\nThe behavior was driven more underground last time, so I do worry it\u2019ll further alienate us", "The \u201chey i just made a joke\u201d thing is how Greg was. It\u2019s why I divorced him. \n\nJokes are funny but Greg was cruel to everyone under the guise of a joke. \n\nIt came to a head when my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and he said \u201cfinally she can get some decent tits\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t want Troy to stop spending time with Greg but I don\u2019t want him to be Greg 2.0", "There is no reason for anyone to take verbal abuse.", "Maybe he needs to feel guilt if his thought process is to constantly hurt someone who hasn't hurt him until now", "He didn't just say I hate you. He has repeatedly treated her badly.", "In that moment, no, I was far from gracious or anything of the sort. \n\nWhen he screamed \u201cI hate you\u201d I just get angry and blindsided", "You can't control what his dad does, but you are in control of your own behavior and you did not handle this situation well at all.  If he has a counselor ask to do a meeting with them and the three of you can discuss.

He really is. He\u2019s thoughtful and volunteers alongside Michael every other weekend at the humane society.

I want Troy to be a well rounded kid and adult, and I don\u2019t want to have a strained relationship with him.", "Greg had one serious girlfriend but it was so obviously a one up man ship that it was pathetic. \n\nI started dating Michael, he started dating Sarah. We get engaged, he proposed literally the following week. We got family photos\u2026 guess who got photos done. Sarah and Greg didn\u2019t make it to the altar. \n\nAs far as I know, he\u2019s been sleeping with a old girlfriend who\u2019s a nice gal, as far as I know.

Beyond.   \n\nAnd I really like dark humor, it\u2019s the kind of comment I might make about myself if I were diagnosed with cancer, but I fully agree that it was horrible & misogynistic coming from Greg.   \n\nIt\u2019s nice that Troy has a fun parent.   Really it is.   (I had no fun parent, just a cruel one and one who was too busy to care.) \nWorking on cars / hunting / fishing are all useful hobbies that I hope Troy will continue to enjoy.    \n\nBut I agree that Greg\u2019s attitude is toxic (and qualifies as parental alienation) and Troy is old enough to understand this.   \n\nI think he\u2019s old enough to hear from you that it\u2019s not \u201chealthy\u201d at all for a grown man to be living solo, having dinner with his elderly mom, and spending so much energy trashing the mother of his child from a relationship 15years gone.    It\u2019s sad.    Honestly.   \n\nLike you\u2019ve moved on \u2014 Greg can\u2019t because he\u2019s broken.   And his mother is happy enabling this behavior because it keeps him chained to her dinner table.   \n\nMaybe Troy is old enough to hear this.    Or maybe two years from now, he will be old enough to hear this.    And you can ask him \u2014 does this seem like a happy way to live?   You wanna live your own life or just follow the same miserable path you\u2019ve watched Greg walk for  a decade and a half?", "As long as it continues, it will.

The apology came afterwards when you both cooled off.", "You mentioned going to therapy during the divorce, have you been since then? This might be a good time to revisit it. I think the things you really need to talk about are too deep and personal for reddit.", "I figure as much and the fact that he is still bad mouthing you says a lot. And your son feels it is ok too so you really need to explain to him that what is father is doing is not ok because I no you don\u2019t want your son  to have the same relationship issues as your ex and your son will be in the dating pool soon. \n\nAnd I am sure you don\u2019t want some poor teenage girl to have to deal with this. \n\nPlease keep us updated and I wish you well\n\nAnd you appear to be a great mother", "That comment was what did it for me. Of all the things to say, that was the worst possible thing. He said he was trying to make me laugh. Nobody found to funny. \n\nI honestly think it\u2019s great that they have so much fun together. Lord knows I\u2019m not the outdoorsy kind, so I do like that Troy has a way to spend time in nature. (Michael and I do a lot of gardening but you wouldn\u2019t find us camping.)\n\nDo I think Greg is a happy, well adjusted adult? No. Do I think Susan is a miserable old woman? Yes, I do.

And uncompromising in your standards for healthy behavior while keeping an open door for him always.   \n\nIt is going to become obvious to him eventually that Greg and Susan are both miserable people.   \n\nIt takes most young adults a few years of being \u201cout in the world\u201d to gain perspective about the people around them.   So usually by age 22-24 they\u2019re starting to question why their friend is always broke, their relatives are always fighting, etc etc.    \n\nAnd I realize this is a really long time for you to wait to discover if your son becomes a version of Greg or not.   :(   \n\nBut honestly, you don\u2019t have to be a saint about all this.   You can ask Troy, \u201cdo your dad and gramma seem happy?   Yes they laugh, but do you think they\u2019re really happy?   They sure complain a lot.   You know complaining changes nothing, right?   You know hating other people is like drinking poison yourself and wishing the other person would die?\u201d   \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to hear it, or will be soon.", "Not here to judge, just wanted to say that OP, you sound like a really good mom.

I think you\u2019re being too hard on yourself, this whole situation sounds incredibly painful. I wish I\u2019d had parents who were half as self-reflective, kind, and forgiving as you.

He\u2019s not gonna change any time soon. \n\nI really just want my son to be a better person and for us to have a good relationship.

Eek. \n\nI doubt this is the first time you have told him his way of speaking to and about you is unacceptable. Your son is a bully, much like your ex and ex-in laws apparently.  If you do not nip this in the bud now, it will just get worse. He will go forward thinking he can treat everyone else this way too and eventually he is gonna run into someone who either with get hurt or hurt him.\n\nAlso just fyi, you deserve to be treated better even if it is just by a bratty teen boy.

This might make him less likely to confide in you in the future because he'll fear you'll over-react.\n\nYou also need to talk to the dad.

He's being placed in an impossible position, and while in an ideal world he'd be nicer, it's not surprising that he cracked. \n\nYou've already acknowledged that you did wrong, so no need to belabor that. But you need to learn skills to help you communicate with him more effectively. Even when he says things that are deliberately cruel. \n\nYou need to start by apologizing to him, and making sure he knows that even when things are difficult that you are always going to love him, and want what's best for him, from your perspective.

It\u2019s one thing to laugh along out of discomfort or join in because you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll turn on you if you don\u2019t. \n\nBut to actually do this to your mom when no one else is there is shit. It says a lot. He\u2019s not just joining in at the dinner table. He\u2019s actually attacking his mom outside of this setting.", "Honestly she could apologize for her initial response and still say that now. But on the other hand, I do hope he's silent because he's a) realizing that apologies aren't a magic wand nor are they obligated to be accepted and b) reflecting on how he treats people he supposedly to cares about", "The thing is, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s truly sorry. I think he\u2019s sorry he got caught and he\u2019s sorry I got angry, but remorseful and willing to change? Ehhh not so much. Nor do I want to send the message that insults = affection and a simple sorry will undo all the damage \n\nGreg has been more of a friend than a father to Troy, which has lent itself to Troy wanting to be his dad. Greg can be very charming, he\u2019s a lot of fun, and he\u2019s the stereotypical \u201cguys guy\u201d - has his own garage, races cars, hunts, fishes. I can absolutely see why Troy would want to emulate his father.", "I am painfully aware how much we as parents influence our children. \n\nIt\u2019s why I have take then high road for fifteen years whenever Greg and Susan start up. It\u2019s why Michael and I have been cognizant of what messages our marriage sends. I have tried my best (though not always successful) to model grace, dignity, and most of all, unwavering love to Troy. There is nothing he can say or do that will ebb the love I have for my son. \n\nAll that said- Troy isn\u2019t sorry for what he did, I don\u2019t think. He\u2019s sorry it produced a negative reaction. I think that unless something very drastic changes, his behavior will only continue and it will escalate. Unfortunately the only person who has the power in his life to be the catalyst for that change if Greg, and I don\u2019t see Greg stopping. \n\nBelieve me, I have tried, God knows I\u2019ve tried, to explain to Troy why a constant stream of nasty remarks and insults at my expense hurt and are inappropriate. I have tried to explain why a bi-weekly hour of how much Susan and Greg loathe me is inappropriate, and how much it hurts that he was a willing, active participant. \n\n*He knows. He does it anyway. That is not love.*", "Thank you for your feedback regarding my abject failure as a parent. \n\nIf you\u2019ll notice my other comments, I did try to stop it. It didn\u2019t work and I cannot prove in court that Greg and his mother are still engaging in this behavior. If I could prove it, I would\u2019ve been in court as fast as I could to at least limit Troys time with Susan. \n\nTroy knows it\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve told him it\u2019s wrong. He is old enough to know how deeply inappropriate and vile his behavior is. He didn\u2019t stand up to his dads family- I get that. He laughed and participated and has *for years*. \n\nAgain, thank you for your feedback and judgement of my complete and utter failure as a parent.", "Troy has a therapist he really likes. I\u2019m super hesitant to drug up a developing brain. \n\nMy hope (among other things) is that Troy will realize at some point what a jerk he\u2019s been and stop this nonsense. \n\nIf nothing else he has to learn that we don\u2019t devote hours of our time spewing hate towards a partner that left a relationship **fifteen goddamn years ago**.", "The phrase \u201cif you loved me you\u2019d....\u201d is very controlling and kinda abusive. You\u2019re putting qualifiers on their love rather than talking about their love language and expressing it. \n\nHe clearly has some communication issues and has picked up some extremely nasty habits, however that is because he has grown up in an environment which is 50% this with no monitoring or being told that is unacceptable but encouraged. \n\nThe phrase \u201cif you loved me\u201d has a very negative approach, it will start him in a defensive level which he will naturally rebel against. Instead of using that, start with something more positive for example \u201cwhen you do or say A B and C I feel loved by you, and when you do or say A B and C I feel hurt by you\u201d. This gives him examples of how you want to be treated and your own love language as we all show it differently. For example \u201cwhen you call me a fat bitch at your dads dinner table, even when I am not there, this hurts me. If anyone did that same about you I would say that in an unacceptable and unkind behaviour, also I would follow this by saying that you are a kind and smart person who I love\u201d.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard when someone we love hurts us, we become the most defensive then and put up the biggest walls. Breaking those down with communication and approach is the best way to impact change.", "Ahh so taking the one space he feels safe and ruining that for him too?", "If this blow up was out of the blue and uncharacteristic, I'd be concerned with the effect the bullying is taking on him, and the question as to why you never give the advice dad gives could be real conflict and confusion on how to handle things. I think you're his safe place, he's obviously not going to show his fears to the dad that tells him to man up and throw fists. But if you see his therapist as a safe place, make sure it's ok with him that you join in for a session with that particular person.", "I don\u2019t like to hear you speak like that. You are, I\u2019m sure, an exemplary parent. Anyone is allowed to feel hurt. It isn\u2019ta privilege reserved for those younger than you. Be happy.", "I hope that everything works out for you and him. \u2661 Do you have a therapist? If you don\u2019t it might be good to have one for you, so that you have an outlet for yourself.", "I mean ... tell the kid in a very sensible matter why they broke up and don't let it turn into a bash fest, even if it's justified. \n\nMore like ... here's how you're father treated me, this is how it made me feel, can you understand why that made me feel bad and I left? \n\nTeach the kid empathy and let him draw his own conclusions.\n\nMy dad can be a difficult person (not like the dad here, but he has the emotional capacity of a tea spoon) and we don't have a lot in common. I don't agree with everything he does always, but I know he will always be there for me and I love him very much. You can see someone for who they are with all their flaws, disagree with them sometimes and still love them. You don't have to blindly accept that sort of behaviour either from family if it's toxic or harmful to you. \n\nThankfully neither of my parents ever spoke ill of the other, at least in front of me, but I wouldn't have accepted that, even as a teen.", "I will not speak ill of Greg to Troy. Our issues are/were not his issues, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me to say \u201cI divorced your father because he was a verbally abusive asshole. \n\nTroy already gets \u201cmom is a bitch\u201d from Greg, the last thing he needs is me acting in kind", "I respect your opinion but I disagree. \n\nPeople that care for others do not engage in a bi-weekly shit fest against that person. And they certainly don\u2019t delight in it. That is not love. \n\nIf I found out Michael was meeting up with his friends every other week and did nothing but bitch about what a horrible wife I am, I would file for divorce.", "Yes, the situation he has been put in is really awful. It would be hard for an adult to deal with something like this, but he is just a teenager and it sounds like this has been happening since he was very young. \n\nWhen OP said he had a mean steak I thought, of course, how could he not? His dad and grandmother have taught him that.", "And I don\u2019t like being patronized. I don\u2019t like being told I\u2019m a failure as a mother because I stood up to my sons abuse. I don\u2019t like any of that, sir/ma\u2019am, but here we are.", "This is a real catch 22, you\u2019re doing the right thing by not badmouthing his dad, but his dad doesn\u2019t have the same integrity, so the only messaging he\u2019s getting is the dad\u2019s version. \n\nThe issue with this is its creating a mini abusive and manipulative child-near-adult.  You need to find a way to tackle this, but tbh I\u2019ve no idea what the answer is to that.", "May they both discover that they\u2019ve run out of toilet paper after they\u2019re already on the bowl.", "In your post you mentioned that the bullying behaviour at his dads and grandmothers house has been going on a while and for at least 2 years, however I expect it\u2019s been your sons entire life. Have you ever confronted this unacceptable behaviour or is this the first time? For a child, it can be very hard to undo learned behaviour when it hasn\u2019t been policed, especially when it has been taught by a parent or parental figure. \n\nHave you reinforced it in him that certain behaviours and actions are unkind? Like when he bully\u2019s you. And have you praised him for when he does good and kind things? thus expressing love.\n\nIf you think you want to never have a relationship with your son because he doesn\u2019t love you then sure, \u201cdivorce\u201d him. Push him away, go no contact, never let him in your house again. However if you think he does or will again love you then I\u2019m afraid you are going to have to parent him. Show him love, talk about unacceptable behaviours, when he hurts you, and praise him for behind kind to you.", "He didn\u2019t used to. He really used to be a very sweet and loving boy that wouldn\u2019t bust a grape in a fruit fight. As he got older, Greg started parenting less and friending more, if that makes sense. He treated Troy like a buddy and not his child, which included using him emotionally as an outlet for his anger at Michael and I.", "The concept of conditional love is something a teenager says constantly \"If you loved me you'd do x\" it's extremely common. She hasn't been a Saint either throwing his apology in his face does nothing and then admitting that she lost it when he said he hated her. She needs tougher skin as a parent. You don't get to scream abuses at your kid just because they shot first.", "Youre blaming your kid like this isn\u2019t yours and his dad fault", "Not once have I said I would even entertain the idea of \u201cdivorcing\u201d my child. \n\nThe point is that if this was anyone else, I would\u2019ve never tolerated it. I swallowed it because he\u2019s my son and I hoped he\u2019d see the error of his ways", "I didn\u2019t \u201cscream abuses\u201d at my kid. \n\nAt no time in the entire exchange did I raise my voice. Troy screamed at me. \n\nHe isn\u2019t sorry for what he\u2019s done or what he said. He knows his behavior is hurtful- I\u2019ve told him. He continues to donor. He\u2019s sorry he got called to the carpet with it, and he\u2019s sorry it produced a negative reaction in me."]}
