They have told Michael during custody exchanges that it would be \u201cbest if you left, nobody likes you, and you\u2019ll never be Troy\u2019s real dad.\u201d They\u2019ve made comments about my appearance, my job, my profession, etc- all in front of Troy. It came to a head in 2021 when Troy said that during every Sunday supper they have with Gregs parents (which is every other Sunday) his mom, Susan, would turn it into the I Hate Taco Hour. With everyone at the table, Susan would start in on what a fat cow I am, how I\u2019m a stupid bitch, a horrible mother, etc. Troy & Greg participated in this, laughed at her cruel jokes, and did nothing to stop it. I have made it a point to never speak ill of Greg or his family to Troy. \n\nLast night at dinner, Troy said that he\u2019s been having issues with a classmate. He didn\u2019t tell me because he hoped by ignoring it, it would go away. After much back and forth I told him to talk to someone at school, or I would.\n\nTroy exploded and screamed \u201cWHY CAN\u2019T YOU BE LIKE DAD? HE LETS ME FIGHT MY OWN BATTLES! YOU DON\u2019T LOVE ME! IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULD LET ME FIGHT! I HATE YOU!\u201d\n\nI responded\u2026poorly, in hindsight. I told him, \u201cYour dad not doing anything when his kid is being bullied is not what a good parent does! Ignoring this will not work. And don\u2019t you ever say I don\u2019t love you ever again. I went hungry so you could eat, whereas YOU sat there and made jokes calling your own mother a \u201cfat bitch\u201d. I know you hate me, it\u2019s obvious.\u201d\n\nI got up and left for a walk. I know I responded really badly, but I have had it with being his punching bag. Troy is a good kid, but he\u2019s got a mean streak to him, and I am his target. I collect vintage owl figures, and any time he sees a new one, he makes a snide remark. (I don\u2019t have a ton, but if I see one at a thrift store I like, I\u2019ll pick it up. The owls are in my office, where nobody but me sees them.) Troy does not want for anything, mind you. My favorite color is emerald green, and so my bedroom is decorated in lots of emerald green & velvet. He made yet another snotty remark. If I forget something, he\u2019ll reply with, \u201cAnd to think, you graduated the top of your class. Must\u2019ve cheated or something.\u201d \n\nWhen I came home, Troy wanted to talk. He told me that he and his friends show affection by giving them shit, and that\u2019s all he knows. He apologized for \u201cflipping me shit\u201d and said he loves me. I told him, \u201cI don\u2019t accept your apology. You are very cruel on purpose, and if you loved me, you wouldn\u2019t spend hours with Susan calling me a stupid, fat bitch, week after week. That isn\u2019t love, that is pure hatred. Now go get ready for bed.\u201d Troy walked off, and this morning hasn\u2019t said a word to me.

He needs to learn that actions have consequences before he does this to the wrong person who won't tolerate his form of \"affection\".\n\nAlso, this is why we have shitty adults because we excuse their behavior as teens. \n\nHe needs to learn that sometimes, an apology isn't enough.", "NTA. It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of emotional abuse from your ex-husband and his family, and it's not fair for Troy to take out his frustrations on you. It's understandable that you reacted poorly in the moment, but it's important to have a conversation with Troy and explain why his behavior is hurtful. It's also important for him to understand that showing affection by giving someone shit is not an excuse for being cruel. It's okay to not accept his apology right away and take some time to process your feelings, but eventually, it's important to work towards forgiveness and healing. However, it's also important for Troy to take responsibility for his actions and work towards changing his behavior.", "ESH. \n\nI understand that he\u2019s young and pushing boundaries, but actions carry consequences. It\u2019s unreasonable to repeatedly take jabs and think you\u2019ll just take it. You\u2019re only human, and he\u2019s old enough to work on this.\n\nYour response to his \u201capology\u201d was a jab at him, though, and you\u2019re still the adult. You\u2019re supposed to be modeling appropriate behavior. It would have been fair to tell him that an apology is meaningless without changing behavior, and you hope he can show, rather than tell, you he\u2019s sorry.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. Almost went E-S-H but as I wrote it I couldn't help but change my mind. With the way he treats you, I feel like you shouldn't have to just forgive it because he's your kid and he apologized. It's downright abusive. Teenagers can be extremely toxic towards their parents, especially when the other parent encourages it.\n\nYour son treats you like shit. It sounds like this was the straw that broke the camel's back and you responded in a less than ideal way. I think you didn't want to accept his apology because he was apologizing for a single incident when for you it was about a pattern of behaviour, which he has not apologized for and refuses to change.", "I was a shit kid and took it out on my mom because she was the one person who loved me unconditionally. Some harsh words about how I was messing with her emotionally were necessary at some points. Your kid is trying to excuse away his behavior saying his \"friends talk shit\" to express affection imo. I hope he grows out of this and you need to talk to him more about his behavior but NTA.", "NTA. The twice monthly exposure to the vile, nasty jokes and comments have poisoned his mind towards you. I highly recommend you get him into therapy.", "Hmm. NTA. This one's tough, but I don't think you did anything that bad. \n\nYou don't HAVE to accept anyone's apology, and your son is not a little kid anymore.\n\nIt might be good for him to see that a simple apology doesn't always fix things.\n\nYou didn't insult your son or say nasty things about him- a lot of parents do! I think being more firm with him and demanding he show you some respect might  be good for him. \n\nI know a lot of people are going to tell you to get family counseling, but honestly, it's not always helpful. There are a lot of well meaning but ultimately useless counselors out there. It can be very hard to find a good one. Whatever you decide, I wish you good luck. Teenagers truly suck.", "NTA\n\nHe's 16 and in therapy. This doesn't bode well I'm afraid. The anger and constant barrage of painting you as the scapegoat and inferior parent is well established in his mind. Yes, you are the parent but at the same time, there needs to be consequences for striking out at you the way he did. Telling you that he \"shows affection by giving shit\", saying he PREFERS to fight, the fact that he's actively participated in tearing you down along with his father's family is going to take a LOT to undo. You both need to be in therapy but your replay to him was actually valid.", "NTA. It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of emotional abuse from your ex-husband and his family, and it's understandable that you would be sensitive to your son's behavior towards you. While it's good that Troy apologized, it's also important for him to understand the impact of his actions and words on you. You have every right to set boundaries and expect respect from your son, and it's okay to not accept an apology if you don't feel it is sincere or if you need more time to process your feelings. It might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with Troy about how his behavior makes you feel and what you need from him moving forward.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is 16.\n\nYou might be the target now. But in a very short time, it will be his partner. \n\nHe will actively be emotionally and verbally abusive because he\u2019s been taught that is ok. And beyond ok, that it *is* how you treat the important people (particularly females if he straight) in your life.\n\nI\u2019m sickened reading this. He is long overdue for the lesson that an apology can\u2019t simply \u201cfix\u201d everything.", "Nta, parents are human too. We can only take so much hurt from our loved ones before something has to give. Unfortunately reddit thinks parents must be some kind of perfect being or else you're a terrible parent. Hopefully showing him raw hurt emotion rather than carefully put together sentences with the perfect tone amd infliction will knock a little sense into him that his words hurt. When everyone has calmed down enough talk to him explain to him that these things said are cruel and if he continues on through life saying mean hurtful things he will push everyone away. Him trying to play it off as a joke and just some good natured ribbing isn't cool jokes are only funny when both people find it so. Otherwise it's just being mean", "Troy, his father and his family are the biggest assholes here. Your initial response was not terrible. Troy needed to hear some of those things, but you should forgive him. Set the example of kindness and forgiveness because it doesn\u2019t sound like his father or his family are capable of teaching him that.\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s Something you can do with your custody agreement in regards to the time Troy spends with his father and family. If they are sabotaging your relationship with your son or being bad examples, perhaps you can have an attorney write a letter to Greg warning him that you will seek full custody if he continues to poison Troy. \nI had an attorney write a letter to my ex husband when he and his family were behaving similarly. The letter stated that I\u2019d go for full custody and get a court order to prohibit my children from seeing his family if their bad behavior continued. \nIn the meantime, you should have a heart to heart with Troy and tell him that his behavior hurts you and that you won\u2019t tolerate disrespect. \nEventually, Greg\u2019s behavior will backfire. Troy will grow up and see what you have done for him and how you never disrespected his father. The best advice someone gave me while I was going through this was to continue to be the bigger person. Good luck!", " NTA, but maybe it's time to accept the apology, lay down some boundaries, ask him how he plans to change his behavior,  and get some family therapy with both you and your son.", "NTA. You've been very patient with a boy much too old to be using the \"you don't love me\" card, and leagues too old for the \"how dare you not accept my apology the second I apologize\" card.  You did not owe him automatic forgiveness, especially when you've been turning the other cheek or so long. ~~Your ex and his family are so insanely lucky you haven't sued them for parental alienation yet, because that's absolutely what they're doing.~~\n\nThat said, you do need to have a serious sit down conversation with him about this and lay it all out for him- that you never say anything bad about his dad for a reason, that his constant negging at when you forget or collect things is wildly inappropriate and abusive, that constantly bad mouthing you to people that hate you is actively encouraging their hatred towards you, your body and looks are not something that a teenage boy needs to be looking at or talking about, and that affection through craptalking might seem fun in a vacuum, but if he ever has a SO they will break up with him for that.  \n\nIt might be a good idea to start calling out his shitty little comments to you- maybe an \"excuse me?\" or a \"I don't appreciate that, don't do it\". \n\nAlso, you mentioned airing out your issues with him with the therapist- that's a good idea. His therapist needs to know he's doing these things.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. Your ex-in-laws and ex-husband for obvious reasons. Troy can slightly be forgiven because most kids aren\u2019t going to go against the majority at a family gathering, especially if those people are adults. Couple that with the normal trying to fit in and find your place that comes with growing up, and he\u2019s going to struggle. You\u2019re only a slight AH here; as the verbal punching bag for my son, I understand that you can only take so much abuse before you break. You\u2019re only human, and you make mistakes. But you\u2019re also an adult, and a parent. It might help if you could have a therapy session where the two of you hash out some of these things with an unbiased mediator.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nThe reason it\u2019s not ESH is that you are the parent and need to provide unconditional love.\n\nIf you had said I accept your apology and I love you but your words were really painful and when you participate in your fathers harassment of me     that hurts me to and this type of behaviour needs to stop.\n\nYou need to build bridges not set them on fire.", "YTA.  He's a teenager and kids are often mean.  You were cruel towards him and his dad is a bully, where exactly is he supposed to learn to do better?  Maybe get him into therapy, talk to him about things, and work with him.  Sounds like he lives with a dad who the only way he gets acceptance is by participating in being mean towards you.  It isn't right, but you could work to empower him instead of condemning him.  When he apologized you two could have sit and talked.  You could have told him that, while you are glad he apologized, when he sits and listens and participates in others saying hateful things about you it is hard for you to believe that he cares.  Talk about actions and how we treat people we care for.  It sounds like he has missed a lot of those lessons.", "[deleted]", "YTA. I mean, he's a teenager. He apologised in a very self aware way, which is way more than most teenagers would do. The best you could've done was accept it and have the conversation that you will not tolerate this kind of treatment from him.  \n\n\nI also don't know about the Susan remark because it might come across as you resenting him for spending time with his dad. Anything else that his dad's mom does is out of his control. Again, he's a teenager, he's not gonna tell his grandma to shut up. Maybe he's just laughing along to be polite.", "How do you know he goes along with dad's family comments? Also have you thought that maybe he goes along because he feels he doesn't have a choice? That he wants be part of his dad's life, and that's the price to pay?\n\nHe's 16, making remarks and answering back is his job. It's your job however to discipline him, and I don't mean punish him, but teach him how to behave. Your outburst sounds childish and guilt-tripping and your son was actually the mature one in this situation, wanting to talk and apologise, but yet again you played the victim. \n\nYour son already has a shitty half of the family, don't make it a whole.\n\nYTA", "YTA. he explained clearly why he\u2019s been the way he is and you responded by shutting down his vulnerability. what do you want from the kid? he tried to change his ways and you quickly just threw his past actions in his face.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I realize that I should\u2019ve probably said I need him to demonstrate changed behavior instead", "I really don't understand the comments treating this kid like he is 5 years old. He is sixteen. He should be responsible for his words. He is choosing to belittle his mother, to yell at her and makes the excuse of \"that's how I show affection to my friends\". If she just takes the apology and let's it go then he won't ever learn to take responsibility and grow up.", "I reacted like a snot.

I started using jokes as my \u201clove language\u201d if you will because saying things like \u201cI love you/miss you/ appreciate you\u201d etc. was just unnatural and actually physically cringey for me. It started off harmless but got progressively meaner (not to the degree your son has taken it, but I definitely did hurt people), and it became my normal. I still struggle with it because it\u2019s what I default to. I wish someone called me out and taught me a different way of being when I was your son\u2019s age.

And about how this current treatment of you (heavy bad mouthing and all) is basically an extension of that behaviour he had as a partner.

It's like it isn't signaled enough that that part of the family isn't behaving in a normal way and that you are a victim of that. And maybe this is why he goes way beyond the (comprehensible) \"shut up and don't confront the adults, you are a kid, that's ok\", at a point of low-key verbally/psychologically participating in that abuse. I don't know, it's complex, but I'm not entirely sure he isn't actually making you a victim of that abuse from his part... I know you are an adult and his mother, but I'm not sure kids can't do that. It's rare but... Is it really impossible, especially with the action of one of the parents against the other? And if that's the case, how much it's fair to ask to take to the person who is taking the abuse? I don't know...

No he doesn\u2019t. He has one dad, and one step dad, and his actual dad is a higher priority.

Point out how often they trash talk you, point out there's no reason to do so, and point out how you never trash talk them. You should find a way to get him to express why he thinks this is \"love\" and what he feels you've done wrong to deserve to be bashed weekly.

Does he ever watch TV or movies in which the mother isn't being abused by the people around her? He fundamentally knows this isn't normal and is absolutely old enough to know what he is doing is cruel. He's almost old enough to legally drive a potentional death machine. \n\nMany kids have hideous parents and know all along how toxic they are, never join them and flee at first chance. OP gave a well deserved wake up call to her asshole son. She cannot control what he does, or change how he behaves but she can put up hard-core boundaries to protect herself, her self image and her self worth. \n\nTroy desperately needed OP to put up boundaries, he needs to hit the wall and then decide who he is going to be in life. Her ex has raised him to be a miniature abusive version of himself to torture OP. As someone who has been in a similar position, there aren't words in existence to describe how deep that shit cuts. It needs to stop, one way or the other. \n \nOP, protect yourself because only your son can decide if he wants to change and your expectations must be in black and white going forward.

My thoughts are with you.\n\nI would seriously be considering a lawyer to get help in regards to the poisoning of your child by his other family.\nI highly suggest a therapist or counselor to support you and keep reminding you of what you are in control of, and to protect your mental health. They are like a friend and confidante who is there for you 100%. Big hug. \n\nAgain, NTA. Defending yourself and your home against cruel behaviour does NOT make you an asshole.
