Not wanting your daughter to talk to older men online, fine. I get it. But she's a teenager and she's starting to want an ounce of independence. Social media, by and large, is used to talk to their other friends online. Kids are using social media WAY younger than 16 nowadays. And by forcing her to give you every single password of every account she had and punishing her for using the internet in a way that most kids her age are doing, you're going to diminish her trust in you.\n\nThat and restricting something from your kid completely is the fastest way for them to try and hide something from you in private. \ud83d\ude44 Like what, you think she won't just make new accounts and lie about having them?", "YTA. I understand the sentiment but all you\u2019re doing is creating a barrier between you and your daughter. Do you really think she\u2019ll come to you with her problems after this?", "Don't be fooled by the N T A judgments, you are absolutely in the wrong here. If your daughter is indeed as naive as you say she is, then you should be helping her navigate the world and identify danger. What you've done just shows that you don't trust her and deprives her of the ability to hone her own spidey senses, which she will definitely need down the road when you're no longer there to be completely overbearing. YTA.", "YTA\n\nSocial media is dangerous, but most 16 year olds can safely navigate it if their parents teach them the tools to do so. You have set your daughter up for failure and then punished her for it.", "I think that you need to actually talk to her about whats appropriate and whats not. Just observing her profiles doesnt teach her how to be safe it just teaches her that she needs to be sneakier. Teen life is social media. Thats where the other teens are. She needs to be able to talk to her peers without worrying about what you will think about what she says.", "YTA. A conversation between the two of you would be better. She\u2019s going to be 18 in 2 years and you want to have an open line of communication with her. You\u2019re treating her like a child and she\u2019s about to be an adult.", "YTA. Big time. And a control freak. How do you expect your daughter to become a responsible adult when you treat her this way? She is already hiding things from you. It will only get worse and ruin your relationship with her. This is not protection, this is control.", "INFO. I completely get how the situation looks to you, however how did you find out about the account? Did you ask your daughter how these people are known to her? What was the context? Did you ask her about how she keeps herself safe online? Did you have any kind of conversation about it at all? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong - I\u2019m saying that your post reads like you spied on your daughter then jumped straight to conclusions and banned her from everything, which is possibly why she kept the account secret from you in the first place. \n\nI\u2019m all for keeping kids safe online and teaching them how to be responsible and bounce back from mistakes. However, your daughter is 16, so you really should have had this kind of communication with her a long time ago. Also, your response was out of proportion - explain why you think she should delete and block certain people, talk to her about being safe and create an environment where she can come to you with her concerns, knowing that you will help her correct her mistakes without judging or embarrassing her. You flipped out, which she probably knew you were going to do and was precisely why she kept the account secret from you. Your response confirmed to her that she was \u2018right\u2019 to not tell you.", "YTA. You are too controlling. You'll find that out soon enough when your daughter disappears once she turns 18 and you never hear from her again.", "YTA. You've guaranteed that she will hide this stuff from you and won't come to you when she messes up and needs help. Your attitudes about social media need to be an ongoing conversation, not a one and done lecture. Tell her what's at risk, and not just online stranger danger. Colleges and employers look at this kind of stuff now, it can impact mental health and personal growth. There's a lot to be worried about, TELL HER THAT. Most importantly, let her be mad. You mishandled this, apologize and let her be mad at you about it. Work it out, don't just brush it under the rug.", "YTA\n\nYou are gonna get NTA, but hear me out here. When I was 14 Facebook just started getting really popular and I had a secret account. I used it to talk to my friends from school and at the time it was about how many friends you had on Facebook(I know dumb teenage competition). Well I had a few people I talked to that I thought were cute boys from different schools. Which they were. Well one of them had an older brother who was 26(he told me he was only 17) at the time and I started chatting with him about World of Warcraft. He asked me to meet him one day and my little sister saw I was planning on meeting someone one and told my mother who then told my father (they were divorced). they found out his true age and long story short the got him to meet my father at the gas station and the guy never contacted me again . They took my phone from me for months. Yes I should have known better, but I had no one to guide me with how to use social media and what was healthy and not. I got my accounts deleted by my parents and I bitched about not having privacy. Because I had no access to the internet without adult supervision and they had passwords to everything I had. I never told my parents another thing about my personal life choices and now I don't speak to them unless it's to get information for something. Trust is earned, but you also have to teach your daughter the dangers and how avoid them or handle them. You just taking access to everything of hers, makes her not feel she can trust you.", "YTA. You should have talked to your daughter instead.", "YTA. \nInstead of controlling and disrespecting her privacy: have a talk about internet safety and make it clear that you are there to help her if someone starts to creep on her.\n\nShe will keep making new accounts and hide them from you because she can\u2019t trust you", "By doing this you\u2019re going to make her trust you even less and never share anything with you. And then when she goes to college and has freedom she\u2019s going to wild the fuck OUT. Ask yourself if being too involved in your almost adult kids life is worth pushing them away", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s not a baby - stop treating her like one, shes 2 years away from 18 ffs, when she can legally cut you off from her life forever\u2026\n\nA talk about responsible usage would be better", "NTA.\n\nYour not a friend your a parent.  She was getting close to somewhere between being stalked and being abducted.\n\nShe showed she isnt mature enough, its not a question.\n\nThe YTA people are going by the view the world is safe, it isn't.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a middle ground between talking to strange men and getting scammed online and never having any social media of any kind. Your daughter is 16, it\u2019s time for her to be starting to grow and take her first shots at independence while she still has you to fall back on. The fact that she\u2019s already successfully hid an account from you shows that exerting strict control isn\u2019t working, she\u2019s only going to get better at avoiding getting caught. \n\nSo what you need to do is have an honest talk about the risks of people online. Warning signs of scams, warning signs of abuse (pushing for emotional or physical intimacy very quickly, threatening harm to her or harm to themselves if she does something they don\u2019t like, \u201ccompliments\u201d that serve to isolate, things like how she\u2019s so mature for her age, she\u2019s not like the other girls etc, being told that only this person can understand her and her struggles, trying to isolate her from friends or loved ones). The conversation needs to be about *real* things not just wild fears. \n\nAnd then you need to say you will be there for her if she gets in trouble and *mean it*. You need to create an environment where she\u2019s not more scared of being punished by you than she is of something being not right online. To her the online threat is vague and immaterial, you as a parent are very immediate and she will naturally see getting in trouble and being isolated from her friends by having her phone taken as worse than ignoring a warning sign about someone online.", "YTA. That doesn\u2019t make what she did right, but you also lacked specifics on how you discovered it. YTA for how you responded. \n\nIf you do nothing now, except this old school punishment, in two years you will then have a daughter who you cannot punish or take stuff from, and likely will be NC with you anyways. \n\nIt feels like you skipped the educational/parenting part and went straight to punishment. This is a very slippery slope into resentment and then you\u2019ll wonder why she doesn\u2019t open up to you anymore\u2026", "YTA. You know the most effective way to keep a teenager safe on social media? Instead of restricting them, ACTUALLY TEACH THEM HOW TO BE SAFE, my dog, it's not rocket science.", "YTA. Your daughter will never trust you or respect you after this. You just destroyed your relationship", ">I've seen too many stories on the news about teens being cyberbullied, scammed, or even kidnapped by strangers they met online.\n\nIs that why you are bullying her yourself to prepare her for the world?\n\nOverprotective parents often achieve the exact opposite from what they wanted. You need to prepare your child for the world, not shield her against it completely. In 2 years this girl is going to be lawfully free. That means she can leave and never come back, which is exactly where this is going to. If you're kid is naive, than that's your fault. You're controlling her instead of helping her grow.", "She\u2019s two years away from adulthood.\n\nTwo. Years.\n\nKids learn by being given some freedom. Without freedom, they find themselves in dangerous situations because they go from nothing at all to dropped right into the deep end. \n\nIt\u2019s like never allowing your child to drive\u2014and then handing them a driver\u2019s license with no practice and starting them off on the highway. They\u2019ll crash, and it\u2019ll be your fault for not preparing them properly. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nyou say she\u2019s too naive to make sensible judgements when it comes to using social media. That\u2019s your fault for not teaching her how to use her own judgement wisely - a mistake you\u2019re continuing to make. \n\nIf you insist on micromanaging and controlling every detail then she will never learn how to weigh and manage risk and she will go out into the world with no functional survival skills. \n\nAlso being this heavy handed will guarantee that she creates dummy accounts and just gets smarter about hiding them. It also means she won\u2019t feel able to confide in you if something happens that she\u2019s worried might be dodgy - which will put her at more risk. \n\nYou\u2019d have done much more for her safety if you\u2019d built trust with her and helped her develop her own awareness of risk so that she could make good choices even when you\u2019re not over her shoulder and would also feel comfortable telling you about anything she wasn\u2019t sure about. It may be too late for that now you\u2019ve done this but I hope not.", "YTA she's 16 and old enough to control her social media. This is the time for you to teach her what to look for.

I get that you\u2019re trying to protect her but you\u2019re just going to make her become more secretive. And she will be afraid to come to you if she really does need help.

Imagine if your parents had that level of control when you were a teen.

It\u2019s one thing to have the passwords as a safeguard, but the constantly checking it daily is taking it too far. I get wanting to keep your daughter safe, but that constant micromanaging of the social media is going to create issues. The problem is that you allowed her to have the social media before and now it has become a point of contention. Just pick and choose your battles carefully.", "YTA   \nYes, your daughter shouldn't be chatting with older men online but I guarantee she is not as naive as you think she is. You're the naive one.", "YTA stop drinking the news fear juice for 2 minutes please", "INFO: Did you do anything about this outside of rules and restrictions? Y'know, like about the older men chatting with a MINOR?? About the fact that your daughter was seeking attention from older men? Young people don't do this because they're in need of more restrictions. That's a textbook cry for help. And often for a better relationship with a father figure. Look inward.

I get why you want complete control of her accounts, but I also get her need for privacy. Have you had a very REAL conversation about predators and how they will travel counties and states away just to meet up with a child?  Because she needs to know that these sickos will stop at nothing to sexually harm her. She needs a cold dose of reality. Have her at least set her accounts to complete privacy, but I do think she does need some privacy somewhere.", "NTA teens have this crazy idea that they are young adults.

You're right, social media has a lot of dangers for teens and kids - predators/groomers, eating disorders, anxiety/depression, etc. However, just punishing her isn't going to really teach her anything. You need to be talking to your daughter about things like how men groom women and girls, and the things to look out for.

You need to sit down and explain WHY what she\u2019s doing is not okay, and come up with a more proportionate response. There needs to be ongoing communication about expectations on social media, and transparency from both parties.

This is going to make the problem 10x worse, I'm telling you now. Boxing her in will make her want to retaliate more, she'll find ways to make accounts without you knowing. She'll do things just to spite you. She'll also feel like she can't come to you, so if she actually does become unsafe online she won't be able to ask for help. Which could be extremely dangerous. Make her feel safe to come to you. You should not only get rid of the restrictions, but you need to apologize to her and admit you're wrong.", "she is 16. she is reaching adulthood pretty soon. and you make everything to drive her out of your home. you cant cut her from the internet. that is literally impossible unless you ground her in an underground basement 365days a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA you need to trust your daughter and teach her how to use social media safely.", "YTA\n\nMy parents were kind of like you. Wanna know how I felt when they died?  \nRelieved.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re a heavy handed dad who thinks he can control every aspect of his teenager \n\nHow many months is it to when she\u2019s 18 and can move out because of your overbearing behaviour ? \n\nDo you want to destroy your relationship with her ? \n\nThere was nothing to punish her for\n\nYou are treating her like a small child", "YTA. This type of behavior from her father will only make her lie better. My parents did not allow me to have social media but I had it all (FB, Insta, Twitter you name it) since I was 14. As they were not computer savvy, they never found out but their controlling behavior just taught me how to lie better. I am currently LC with them and I still lie to them even though I am a married person because lying is the only thing they taught me with their controlling behavior.", "YTA- you expect your daughter to show you honesty and good judgement and yet react like an AH when you find out about her social media. \nSo she has to come to you with good grace and respect and yet you don't? \n\nThis will plant the seeds of dishonesty for her. \nNow she will lie to you and get very good at sneaking things behind your back. \n\nNever mind having a conversation with her and explaining things \n\nI hope she's able to either go live with mom or is able to escape you when she comes of age. \n\n\nIf you expect honesty and decency from someone you should at least have the ability to return that", "YTA for controlling her the way you are. You need to educate her properly too. Remind her what is inappropriate behaviour, that men over 18 shouldn't be communicating with her at all, etc. When she needs to take evidence to you, the police or another trusted adult etc. \n\nNTA for caring about your kid, the cyber world is scary. \n\nAlso, look for routers that allow you to block certain sites, I only just allowed my teen to view social media and she can't sign up for social media accounts until after she is 16.", "NTA.... at 16, she needs SOME privacy.   But it's also up to us as parents to help guide our kids through making good life choices.   \n\n\nSocial media is rife with stupidity and people intent on doing harm to others because of the anonymous nature of it.  Reddit is a prime example of this.", "YTA and are abusing your child. When she's an adult and never calls or visits you, this is why", "YTA, what are you going to do when she's 18?", "Seriously. She's going to be an adult in less than two years. OP is running out of time to safely guide the daughter with appropriate supervision. If she is completely shielded from anything with even the slightest potential for danger, there will be little opportunity to teach her how to navigate the internet safely.", "Yes!! At 16 you should know how to protect yourself online and offline. OP can take her phone but what if she meets someone inappropriately older in person? You shouldn't heal the symptoms, you should heal the cause. But OP sounds like one of those parents that always chooses the easier way. Why spend hours, days, weeks on teaching your daughter something when you can take her phone? OP, YTA.", "Yeah I think OP is mistaken if she believes she will be able to successfully control any and all of her child\u2019s activity online. Kids tend to be cleverer about these things than their parents. And now, thanks to her heavy-handed response to the problem, she\u2019s essentially closed the door on any kind of open communication and guidance that her child may have been receptive to. The lesson being taught here is not how to avoid these things and be safe online, it\u2019s that she needs to avoid getting caught.", "Nevermind the detrimental effects on mental health caused by years of walking on eggshells and having no privacy, and being excluded socially because you can't participate in the SOCIAL of soxial media...", "Agree with the above, but make sure you have a conversation about being safe online and being as wary of strangers online as they are on the street. Life is never about restriction but educating about the potential dangers", "Man times change and its sad. Teen life should not be social media, young people keep downplaying the dangers.  It only from stangers and predators, but to self esteem, etc.  Wish more parents cared as much instead of giving into threats of  cutting the parents out for good.", "She IS a child. She isn\u2019t turning 18 in two days, there\u2019s a big difference between 16 and 18.", "Totally agree - not to mention how naive you have to be to think you have found \u201call\u201d her secret accounts. All you are teaching her is how to be more tech savvy in her secrecy!", "Let\u2019s also realize that just because you control her socials doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t going to go out there and meet a guy in the real world. Sounds like you are trying to delay the inevitable here", "Edit: I'm a 45yr Mom of a 27F, 19M and 7M. I've been through stuff like this with my Daughter and she still thanks me till this day for being strict with her when it came to things that she didn't realized endangered her. You're doing the right thing Momma.", "No. op is TA. there is a way to keep your children safe online and teach them better ways to use it but to absolutely flip out like this is not it. This is why her daughter did it secretly.", "Some of them kind of are though. It depends on the circumstances and the kid. I had a job at 16 as a waiter in a hotel, got good grades in aps, was headed to Georgetown a few years later, and my dad (who raised me) left me alone for a week at a time here and there for business trips to Japan. I mean, I turned out fine. I\u2019m 41 and still alive. I really think it depends on the kid at that particular age.", "I don\u2019t think you understand what \u201cprivacy\u201d means.", "Maybe OP can build a moat? That might work.", "Thank you, I appreciate this answer a lot.", "He found her talking to older men, I am assuming men are 18+ \ud83d\ude2c There are so many stories of underaged girls meeting up with older men. This could be nothing or he could've prevented something terrible from happening. \n\nHow do you police her online activity and allow freedom?\n\nMy kiddo will get a phone if grades are good next month. I wish we could get a landline instead \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udc80", "Whats the alternative? Literally where are kids supposed to hang out if not online? Also there are strangers and predators offline too. And self esteem damaging ads on every billboard and the magazines on the shelf and on the sides of trucks.", "I\u2019m not saying that you aren\u2019t the parent or that you have no say, I\u2019m saying that you are not dealing with a child you\u2019re dealing with someone who will shortly be an adult. You should be able to have a conversation with her. \n\nYou\u2019re sabotaging her feelings about being honest with you.", "The thing is that it's the parents responsibility to teach kids how to be grown-ups so when the safety net is gone, they will be able to fly the nest and not fall.\n\nOP isn't helping her navigate social media in a healthy way. He's just gone full helicopter and removed any trust and autonomy from his daughter.", "So does she magically gain adult knowledge at 18?", "Of course you do, you only responded to one N T A and nothing else. But YTA who your daughter will one day be NC with", "My parents did what you did and that\u2019s when I got exposed to gr00ming and saw male genitalia at the same age as your daughter. Up to this day they still didn\u2019t know what happened to me. Who knows maybe your daughter might end up experiencing what I faced because you decided to become a helicopter parent rather than guiding her what to avoid in social media.", "Enjoy your daughter going non contact with you", "It\u2019s easy - you explain to them that this can happen, that older men/women can fake being kids to lure them\u2026\n\nHiding this kind of thing from them does them absolutely no good.  I get wanting to let kids be kids, but let\u2019s be honest we live in a world that requires kids to grow up somewhat quickly, and shielding them from certain realities will only cause harm in the long run", "I don't have kids but I can talk from the perspective of an ex teenager (I am 26 so I was teenager when internet and social media were a thing already). The best thing you can do is to create a relationship with your kid that's full of trust. That's 90% of the solution and the other 10% is hope for the best. \ud83d\ude02 Everytime I did something bad (or someone did something bad to me) I hid it from my parents because I was afraid of their reaction. Your kid will make mistakes no matter what precautions you will take. But the consequences can be much less severe if the kid trusts you enough to ask you for help. Of course, you should check if something is suspicious or your kid acts strange. I honestly think it's more likely for a teenager to feel awful for being different that their peers that meeting with older men. \nLast thing I'm gonna say: they'll have sex no matter what you do \ud83d\ude02 make sure they know how to protect themselves! And good luck! \ud83c\udf40", "I agree and stand with your opinion. I grew up being bullied by family, friends, and classmates and partially because my interests were so different from the people I grew up with. Got outcasted. And let me tell you, I tried so hard to be friends even if people were mean to me. When I started gaming/being online, I found like minded people and actually made some really good friends online. I\u2019m definitely in the minority but online has improved me.\n\nI also want to add, I have always made friends from varying ages. I KNOW I am in the very small minority but I have made friends that are a lot older then me. HoWeVer. I think I am the minority because I just wanted to play with people. These older friends were never once creepy or anything and often times were more mature behaving then people my age. LOL\n\nNow I am all for internet safety and communication around it. I definitely do agree with your original comment though.", "Oh please lol, hang out in person, at friends homes, interact with their families. Go do outdoor activities, shopping, hiking, gaming at eachothers homes, phone conversations.  Yes predators are everywhere but online access infinitely  adds a ton more access to kids that are unsupervised.  Every teen would be fine without SM.", "I\u2019m 26. I don\u2019t have a child.", "Lol what?", "These kind of posters are definitely troll right, or maybe delusional who knows.", "I must be in the minority but I am anti social media, I think there's a lot of stuff floating around and if you like the wrong picture, share something insensitive or are supportive of the wrong political party it has an emotional and social tax. Plus colleges and work Google you. Why create a history online for yourself? If I am down voted here I am not going to feel sad because I am an adult and understand nothing online matters. But kids can't do that. \n\nI think texting and calling should be fine \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ok so you listed 1. Their homes. 2. Mall or shopping center. 3. The Outdoors. \n\n1. Part of the point is to be away from parents. Teens want a chance to try to be a person without being listened in on by parents. Houses have parents in them. \n\n2. Idk if this is an everyone thing but any time I showed up to the mall with my friends security followed us around and usually kicked us out. \n\n3. I dont know any teen whos allowed to go hiking alone.", "Thought you were OP. My apologies.", "Oh I looked at your comment history. You REALLY want control of young women. Super normal of you lol", "I generally agree but you can also use social media to see things you like and communicate with people you like. But yes, you can't explain that to teens. It's important to find a way to make them safe but not left out.", "Sir wanna control some teen\u2019s toy instead of giving proper advice"]}
