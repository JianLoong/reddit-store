Unfortunately, I was struck a fatal wound on Christmas day; my mother gifted me a lovely set of 8 glasses. \n\nJk They're actually a lovely gift and I'm appreciate them very much lol. But you were all correct that cups were THE hot item to apparently get me this year lol and I lost this battle\n\nNo matter what you celebrated, I hope you all enjoyed the New Year!
