Unfortunately, I was struck a fatal wound on Christmas day; my mother gifted me a lovely set of 8 glasses. \n\nJk They're actually a lovely gift and I'm appreciate them very much lol. But you were all correct that cups were THE hot item to apparently get me this year lol and I lost this battle\n\nNo matter what you celebrated, I hope you all enjoyed the New Year!

My husband bought a chemistry flask especially to use as a wine decanter, lol.", "Retaliate by getting them a set of vintage [Welch's jelly jars](https://preview.redd.it/sxuld4bk2m821.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=26a8cdc65dc7baacab0e7eaaf8cd7f71f8a77708) with cartoon characters printed on them next Christmas.", "thats adorable :D", "Ha! Great update but while I (50F) also have \u201creal\u201d cups, I have tons of old jars that I\u2019ve used as my cups for years.", "Photos of the cups or it didn\u2019t happen!", "Id have said thanks and then donated them, next time they come round just say well i forgot they were real and ended up smashing them", "I love that place and their dipping sauces!", "Imma cry when cranberry lemonade and tender Mac season are over. \ud83d\ude2d", "My kids choose to use the jars instead of cups.\n\nAnd I didn't read all the comments on the original, but if no one told you: oil. Peel off as much paper as possible, and either spray with cooking spray or swipe with some cheap cooking oil, let it sit for a few, and the adhesive will come off of (most) jars. \n\nAlso, [Classico](https://images.heb.com/is/image/HEBGrocery/000122941) pasta sauce jars are the best. They have measure marks and everything under the label.", "I specifically buy candles and such that are poured into containers that are glassware - ikea is great for this!  Cheap AND reusable, lol.\n\nTell your family that you using food containers as glassware is better than getting a wick in their ice tea, lol.", "In my house we refer to jars as \"Italian wine glasses.\"", "Booooooooooo to your family not embracing the pickle jars!", "Lol, I'm glad it's all in good fun. \n\nThe first time my husband's grandmother came to my house, he served her water in a plastic cup and she was highly offended.

They're super cute tho, aren't they?", "That sounds so bomb?? I kind of want to get one now too!", "I've heard a variety of methods but not oil yet! Thank you for the suggestion.\n\nAlso, whhaaaatttt? That's awesome! This is a game changer in pasta jar-cup collection.", "A little bit of variety never hurt nobody, right? :)", "Hey I know you're (hopefully) just making a joke, but this is a lovely gift. My mom doesn't make a lot of money (she's a lunchlady) and genuinely just wants me to have nice things cause she knows I don't always take care of myself or buy nice things for myself. She loves me very much and I her, and that's reflected in the little things she does for me. Yes even buying cups that I don't really need. This was supposed to be a fun little post about dumb disagreements with cups, so please be gentle.  :)", "Of course, the proof is in the pudding er cups! Lmao, I put a photo up in my profile!", "They've gone up with inflation, too. \ud83d\udc80 I splurged once this fall when the pumpkin was in season but I've had to become quite judicious this year.", "You're kidding! LOL!\n\nWhat the hell were they complaining about then? Jelly jar repurposing whiners...", "Hahah, I think it's because I ONLY had old jars and tiny cups and nothing else. They have a smorgous board of McDonalds Mickey Mouse cups, Welch's jars, and 'real' fancy cups, so I think they just wanted me to have some nicer ones if I ever needed to impress lol! \n\nThough they are whiners lmao. Whenever my dad comes over now, he jokes and asks me for a jar of pickle juice for a drink lol", "I took a bunch of old tiramisu dessert glasses from my sister and use it as shot glasses! Cups are overrated! Lol", "I'm going on 38, own my own home. I do have cups.......but they're dishwasher bleached to hell Washington Nationals souvenir cups. Some probably as old as 10 years. Lost a few to stress crack leaks in the bottom. I was at one point given a set of 4 proper glasses. One broke in the wash. I've never replaced it. If holds a decent amount of a liquid and can be washed, its a cup in my book.", "I have proper cups in my cupboard, but I still drink coffee and wine out of repurposed jam jars. I just like the shape of them.   \n\n\nYou do you!", "My go to water glasses are the giant mason jars. I'm lazy and I drink alot of water!", "Fun fact, there's some products where the jars are like glasses.  I've got small German style beer glasses that were the containers for German mustard.  My mom had more traditional style glasses that were also mustard jars, or dried beef is another style jar that you wouldn't know was a jar.  But my fave is I use hot sauce jars that look like skulls with mason jar threads.  Look around and buy a product with a nice jar, when you finish it, you have a free glass.", "You put a stop to those presents!  What next?  New sheets \ud83d\ude02", "You should put the cups in a display cabinet like fine china and make a huge deal of bringing out \u201cthe fancy cups\u201d whenever they come over", "What is the restuarant? Now I want to see if there's one near me so I can get a jar haha", "I live in the south and there is a popular restaurant in my town that serves drinks in Mason jars.", "Slim chicken? I have a whole shelf in my cabinet dedicated to them. Also, best fast food chicken AND dessert I've ever had. A true addiction.", "I still have a couple of these from the 1960s when I was a kid.  Great for juice!", "Omg I had those as a kid! I miss them", "I forgot about these.  Some of my old cups have died over time.  I might repurpose the glass jelly jars when they empty instead of recycling.", "That's what we had when I was a kid! Also had some plastic cups (mostly from my mom's Tupperware selling days), but we just as often drank from jelly jars, lol.", "These are the ones I have!! Tons of them, honestly. Their labels are also really easy to get off.", "**Be careful reusing candle glass!** Especially if you're putting anything too cold or too hot in it! \n\nOnce a candle has finished burning the glass has gone through so many heating/cooling cycles that internally it's pretty weak. The big advice is to NEVER refill the glass with another candle because it **will** end up exploding on you.\n\n You are usually safe to reuse them as other decorative/storage things but I would be very wary of using them to drink out of even since the temperature changes caused by whatever your put into it could be enough to shatter the glass still, and if you're actively drinking from it when that happens it won't be pretty.", "I Googled, \"cheesecake mason jar chicken restaurant\" & I think it may be Slim Chickens", "Rubbing alochol is also a good one, I regualary save jars because I just like them and I've found that rubbing alcohol does wonders to breakdown the adhesive (once the majority of the paper has been ripped off) and it doesn't leave your fingers/the jar all oily afterwards!", "To get labels off easily remove as much of the label you can then mix olive oil and bicarbonate of soda into a thick gritty paste. You spread it onto the jar and leave  spread it on the jar and leave for 5-10 mins and then rub the soda mixture off. This should remove it but if any remains just put on some more and repeat. It works brilliantly on sticky residue then rinse off in warm soapy water and your jar is clean .", "Lol...who didn't see that coming? Glad you are taking it in stride.", "So lemme guess, you now have like 30 cups from ALL your family gifting them? :P Even telling aunts and uncles. :D", "All my \"real\" cups have broken while the canning jars are still in service!", "Lol y'all aren't from the South, are you?", "I still have some of those. Also, a full set of Looney Tunes glasses from a long ago Burger King promotion. I also have a mug of bears getting busy: https://imgur.com/P5lEYcD", "My mom has glasses from the 1950s that used to peanut butter jars. I\u2019m using mason jars that had spaghetti sauce in them as soap dispensers. Ordered the pumps off Amazon.", "Fuck me. That sounds good. Where is this place?", "I've also found Goo Gone is helpful for really stubborn stuff.", "I hate to inform you that he's going to make that joke for years to come. Dads.", "My best glasses are Adams peanut butter jars. It takes a lot to break them.", "I would still make a point to serve a jar when you have family,  a bit of harmless fun.\n\nWe have mason jars and jam jars as drinking vessels, and an extensive collection of coffee cups, so I see no problem with jars.", "This has to be the least-dramatic-I\u2019m-invested, aita story lol. Alas, grandpa pickle jar had a good run, he will not be forgotten!", "After years of the dishwasher converting clear glasses into foggy remnants of their original clarity, I discovered stainless steel drinking cups.  Comfortable rolled rims for sipping, and even pretty, with a rainbow finish.  And nobody complains about them.", "As someone who frigging loves chickens, I am SO disappointed that we don't have Slim Chickens in this state so I can get me one of those jars. \ud83d\ude2b", "That\u2019s so fun! I also wish to have rockabilly chicken mason jars one day. \ud83e\udd79", "...I need the name of this place", "Canning lids fit too. I'll eat the sauce(not my favorite own) just for the jars.", "You do. Plastic cups and wine are ok at a pool party, but there is a difference between plastic drinking cup rims and glass rims on a glass. Plastic glasses is an oxymoron.", "Slim Chickens. It's pretty good but pricy", "This may be the least stressful AITA I\u2019ve ever seen", "Original thread, 'NTA - cups are societal brainwash'\n\nepic reddit moment", "OP,  baking soda and olive oil. Labels will disappear with this remedy.", "I have the opposite problem!! I've lived in small apartments most of my life, but I've also spent a lot of time working in beer bars and have been \"gifted\" many glasses from beer reps. I also inherited a small set of glassware from my mother, and I'm a fiend for fun mugs. \n\nI also don't host things pretty much ever bc my apartment with my partner is too small and doesn't have a dining room/kitchen table. \n\nThat said, we still save jars for storage or drinking containers! Why waste it? A pickle jar can be a great drinking glass, and is larger than most others", "Well now I\u2019ve looked up this restaurant and want to eat nothing else. I hope you\u2019re happy.", "Slim Chickens indeed! I'm a sucker for the Cayenne Ranch.", "It's Slim Chickens!", "If you ever get a chance to visit Slim Chickens, it's a solid chicken chain!", "Slim Chickens!", "Slim's will get a hold of you, I swear! I'm borderline addicted to their seasonal cranberry lemonade.", "The sauce isn't the best, true. It goes on really good sales near me tho, so I buy it anyway. The jars are a great consolation prize, too xD", "That was my dad's favorite glass growing up!  A big, glass peanut butter jar.  I had totally forgotten.  Thank you, kind Redditor, for bringing back such happy memories.", "It is! It is Slim Chickens. Their jars have their rooster mascot on them.", "Glad to hear that they're lovely.....\n\nMay insuggest that the glasses can be even lovlier:\n\nVases,\nPlant pots,\nTea light holders\nXD\n/s", "I'm sorry you lost the battle, I think it was a cool idea! Original \ud83d\ude04", "Yeah I'm gonna need some rockabilly chicken jars, they sound amazing!!", "Oof sweet red chili here"]}
