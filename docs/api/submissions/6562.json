Unfortunately, I was struck a fatal wound on Christmas day; my mother gifted me a lovely set of 8 glasses. \n\nJk They're actually a lovely gift and I'm appreciate them very much lol. But you were all correct that cups were THE hot item to apparently get me this year lol and I lost this battle\n\nNo matter what you celebrated, I hope you all enjoyed the New Year! Off to clean these bad boys.", "created_utc": 1672937570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1043rxl/update_aita_for_not_having_real_cups/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Lol.\n\nI'm a 32yo man and all of my water glasses are decorative mason jars from a restaurant nearby that serves cheesecake deserts in them.

My husband bought a chemistry flask especially to use as a wine decanter, lol.", "Retaliate by getting them a set of vintage [Welch's jelly jars](https://preview.redd.it/sxuld4bk2m821.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=26a8cdc65dc7baacab0e7eaaf8cd7f71f8a77708) with cartoon characters printed on them next Christmas.", "thats adorable :D", "Ha! Great update but while I (50F) also have \u201creal\u201d cups, I have tons of old jars that I\u2019ve used as my cups for years.", "Photos of the cups or it didn\u2019t happen!", "Id have said thanks and then donated them, next time they come round just say well i forgot they were real and ended up smashing them", "I love that place and their dipping sauces!", "Imma cry when cranberry lemonade and tender Mac season are over. \ud83d\ude2d", "My kids choose to use the jars instead of cups.\n\nAnd I didn't read all the comments on the original, but if no one told you: oil. Peel off as much paper as possible, and either spray with cooking spray or swipe with some cheap cooking oil, let it sit for a few, and the adhesive will come off of (most) jars. \n\nAlso, [Classico](https://images.heb.com/is/image/HEBGrocery/000122941) pasta sauce jars are the best. They have measure marks and everything under the label.", "I specifically buy candles and such that are poured into containers that are glassware - ikea is great for this!  Cheap AND reusable, lol.\n\nTell your family that you using food containers as glassware is better than getting a wick in their ice tea, lol.", "In my house we refer to jars as \"Italian wine glasses.\"", "Booooooooooo to your family not embracing the pickle jars!", "Lol, I'm glad it's all in good fun. \n\nThe first time my husband's grandmother came to my house, he served her water in a plastic cup and she was highly offended.

They're super cute tho, aren't they?", "That sounds so bomb?? I kind of want to get one now too!", "I've heard a variety of methods but not oil yet! Thank you for the suggestion.\n\nAlso, whhaaaatttt? That's awesome! This is a game changer in pasta jar-cup collection.", "A little bit of variety never hurt nobody, right? :)", "Hey I know you're (hopefully) just making a joke, but this is a lovely gift. My mom doesn't make a lot of money (she's a lunchlady) and genuinely just wants me to have nice things cause she knows I don't always take care of myself or buy nice things for myself. She loves me very much and I her, and that's reflected in the little things she does for me. Yes even buying cups that I don't really need. This was supposed to be a fun little post about dumb disagreements with cups, so please be gentle.  :)", "Of course, the proof is in the pudding er cups! Lmao, I put a photo up in my profile!", "They've gone up with inflation, too. \ud83d\udc80 I splurged once this fall when the pumpkin was in season but I've had to become quite judicious this year.", "You're kidding! LOL!\n\nWhat the hell were they complaining about then? Jelly jar repurposing whiners...", "Hahah, I think it's because I ONLY had old jars and tiny cups and nothing else. They have a smorgous board of McDonalds Mickey Mouse cups, Welch's jars, and 'real' fancy cups, so I think they just wanted me to have some nicer ones if I ever needed to impress lol! \n\nThough they are whiners lmao. Whenever my dad comes over now, he jokes and asks me for a jar of pickle juice for a drink lol"]}
