I\u2019m willing to bet if you get this upset & angry over breakfast in PJs then you are also criticising your husband and teenagers over a lot of other *relatively unimportant* stuff too. There\u2019s no way you only hate this one thing in isolation & are super accepting of your family in all other areas. \n\nFortunately, he\u2019s worked on himself & stopped criticising the small stuff in life. \n\nHe admits he is so much happier than he used to be. And he\u2019s a nicer person to be around. \n\nHis young adult kids frequently visit just to hang out, because they enjoy his company. They absolutely would not be doing this if he hadn\u2019t done this work on himself. He would be getting the \u201cparental duty\u201d visits that their mother gets. (They were both equally critical when they were together - they fed that bad behaviour in each other). \n\nIf it helps - we figured out that the main root cause of his criticising others was that he was intensely self-critical. Apparently people who are very self-critical will intermittently reach a point where the pain of that gets too intense, so they turn the criticism outwards. \n\nIt was zero fun being on the end of that. Horrible to live with someone who just criticises you to give themselves some pain relief.", "YTA. You're making a big issue out of nothing.

If you feel bad, it's probably because you recognize that you handled the situation all wrong. Apologize to everyone, explain that you were exhausted why them being the way they were bothered you, then have a conversation with your family about it.
