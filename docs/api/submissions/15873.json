I guarantee he\u2019s doing this on purpose - he doesn\u2019t really believe you ate all the yogurt. He wants it for his smoothies and made the comment so you\u2019d leave it alone. Is this the first time you\u2019ve done something totally innocuous (eating a small portion of a grocery you bought in your own home), and he made it into a thing? This is one step in a long campaign of basically training you - you do something totally innocent, he gaslights you until you slightly raise your voice (because being questioned about your take on reality relentlessly is maddening, as it\u2019s designed to be), and BOOM, he\u2019s triggered and you\u2019re the bad guy. Now he\u2019s pouting until you apologize. And I\u2019ll bet it works - you\u2019ll think twice when you reach into the fridge for a bite of yogurt. And then it\u2019ll be something else, and then something else, till you have a \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d feeling all the time. You\u2019ll put so much mental energy trying to avoid triggering him and these gaslighting conversations; but they\u2019ll be unavoidable, because no matter how you behave, he\u2019ll do it again and again until you find yourself thinking about \u201chow\u2019s he going to react to this\u201d before you do anything. It\u2019s almost  impossible to cure a person who does this. Beware.", "Uh, this is a perfect example of gaslighting.

It is only me paying for anything until he gets his insurance (which is hopefully soon).", "Deciding that OP is lying/ choosing not to believe them and pushing that narrative despite what they told him is a gaslighting technique", "I have tried to talk to him about it, but he doesn't believe me at all. I am so confused about why he is reacting so badly about it, why he is so convinced that I did it, and why it would even matter as I could always buy more even if I had done it (which I know I hadn't)", "I didn't yell. I was maybe only a couple of tones louder than my speaking voice, and I definitely didn't have an angry tone. If anything it's frustration and confusion as I have no idea how this is such an issue.", "The definition of gaslighting is to make someone question reality. Isn't his comment about it having to have been me sleepingwalking or it being ghosts an attempt to gaslight me, even though I am aware I don't sleepwalk nor believe in ghosts to that extent?", "He had also gotten upset earlier because I had drank the can of iced tea in the fridge and he was so excited to drink it. He was going on and on about it. We had more (just not in the fridge), as well as had ice in the freezer. (That happened just before he brought up the yogurt situation).\n\nTo explain how frustrated he had gotten, we were playing Fortnite together while he brought all of this up and he quit the game before storming off to the bedroom.", "Except gaslighting is deeper than lying. It means you're deliberately trying to destabilize someone's mental health by distorting their sense of reality to the point where they doubt their own perceptions and sanity.", "That really has nothing to do with the yogurt argument. He either genuinely thinks you must have eaten more (maybe some shame that he apparently ate so much of it) or he knows you didn't and is legitimately trying to gaslight you.\n\nI'd toss this away as a one off but watch for other signs just in case.", "You need to ask him why he thinks you did. Though if he can't answer that, then yes he probably is gaslighting you and you should run away.", "NTA. But by Occam's razor standards he's being a jerk. Over yogurt. That you bought. For both of you to consume. \n\nHe's not trying to make you doubt your sanity, which is what gaslighting actually is. He's just being an AH.", "Maybe it\u2019s because you *only pay for groceries*? In what world is that a fair division of financial responsibilities? The yogurt thing is really stupid, but maybe it was a tipping point due to bad communication - like you aren\u2019t contributing all that much and now you\u2019re taking his yogurt too. And he\u2019s over it. (Yeah, I get *you* bought it, but you know it\u2019s a  staple he uses daily and all you\u2019re contributing is groceries, so\u2026)\n\nESH because clearly he needs to speak up and have a grown up conversation with you. Probably should\u2019ve had some deeper talks before moving in together.", "Yeah uh he's acting crazy. \n\nUnless it turns out you have some disorder that makes you lose memories, or he has such a disorder. But either way you can't be having a future with someone who can't even talk about yogurt properly. Like, it's YOGURT. And he ran off to shut down because??", "Your frustration and confusion are both valid. My comment about yelling was just based on your post. I think this relationship might be hitting its expiration date.", "I think he legitimately believes that you are eating more yogurt than you said you did. \n\nAlthough, if this were a television show, you'd find a secret passage in your apartment and there'd be a random dude living in it and stealing your yogurt.", "Did he make you question reality by his comment about you sleepwalking? Did he actually try and convince you that that is what you did? Or did he just say that sarcastically? If the latter, then it\u2019s not gaslighting. \n\nRegardless, this whole thing seems ridiculous. Even if you did eat the yogurt and that is why you run out quickly, why is that a problem? Yogurt is meant to be consumed, no? And then he was angry again a few days later and when asked about that he mentioned the yogurt incident again instead of talking about what was upsetting him? Something is up with your boyfriend and it\u2019s not the lack of yogurt.", "Yeah, and insisting someone is lying when they are not, over time, makes people literally doubt themselves and it messes with their sanity. Which is what her bf is doing, she says no I'm not eating the yogurt, he says yeah right. She again says I'm really not eating the yogurt, he ways yes you are but probably when you are sleepwalking. The seeds of doubt are planted in her....do I sleepwalk? Could I have eaten some and just don't remember? That's the only reason he's so mad, because I must be wrong?\n\nThis is gaslighting. Used over and over in conversations over a long time, it causes people to break down, just as 7 drinks a day eventually makes someone an alcoholic.", "They're paying for everything", ">>Right now he has been on sick leave for work, and has had no income for months as he has been waiting for insurance. It is only me paying for anything until he gets his insurance (which is hopefully soon).\n\nOops, looks like you read into things and jumped to the wrong conclusion. OP said they pay for all the groceries; they never said that's the only thing they pay for.", "That's honestly what I am fearing. I want to be able to communicate with him calmly, but often times it feels like he is either unwilling to understand how I feel as it is different than him, or he gets stuck on little situations to make me seem incompetent or like a liar.", "He didn't make me question reality as I know I don't sleepwalk, but he just seemed VERY insistant that I was eating a lot of the yogurt.\n\nI know that my boyfriend and I are not the perfect couple (we both have mental health issues that we are getting professional help for), but I genuinely don't understand why he keeps bringing up the yogurt. If he had an actual issue with me, I'd rather him speak honestly than just continuously bringing up the yogurt - so I am just confused.", "Yeah, lucky for me I saw the movie Gaslight before people started to equate that with lying. \n\nRefusing to admit you eat the lion's share of the yogurt because you selfishly want to keep it all to yourself is not the same as deliberately trying to make someone crazy because they no longer trust their own perceptions. \n\nHe's not trying to have her committed. He's just a selfish liar.", "Yeah you\u2019re describing pretty toxic behavior. I recommend looking for somewhere else to live.", "I definitely do not think it\u2019s about the yogurt. Something else is making him act like this that probably has nothing to do with you but the yogurt is just the scapegoat for whatever he\u2019s going through. It\u2019s possible it\u2019s something he feels he can\u2019t tell you so he\u2019s choosing to push you away by being angry over yogurt. \n\nI hate giving an armchair diagnosis on Reddit but is it possible he\u2019s not telling your the truth about something or has been unfaithful in some way? It\u2019s a pretty common tactic to misplace personal guilt. A friend of mine was dumped because he finished the last of the left overs one night and his fianc\u00e9e got angry and said he\u2019s selfish because he never thinks about her and broke off the engagement. Turns out she was in love with someone else and she actually later apologized and said that was just the only thing she could find to break up over because she didn\u2019t want to admit what was actually happening.", "He goes back and forth between saying how much he loves me to dwelling on small things that shouldn't even be issues to call my a liar. A couple of my friends who have met him said he has signs of Borderline Personalify Disorder, which we are hoping to get him tested for soon.", "\"Whatever\" is a politically correct way of saying \"f*** you\"! (IMO) (~);}", "If you bought the yogurt, you have every right to eat it! So, the next time the asshole says anything about it, open the fridge, grab the yogurt and eat it all !!!

(~);}", "My partner and I have different approaches to eating ham. \n\nI like All The Ham, generously served. And I won\u2019t eat it more than 3 days after the packet is opened. (As per the instructions on the packet!)\n\nHe likes a small sample at a time, and doesn\u2019t believe the food safety advice, so keeps it for at least a week after opening. \n\nAfter a few (minor but annoying) disagreements I now buy 2 packs at a time and label them with a sharpie pen. \n\nHappiness all round.\n\nETA: also my partner has pretty bad FOMO over food. If we buy anything vaguely nice I have to police myself to not eat more than 50%. He\u2019s relaxed a bit since we got together but he\u2019s definitely still got issues around this. I variously accept it (there\u2019s no reason I should eat 80% of the \u201cnice bread\u201d because I\u2019m home & fancy it - it would be a bit selfish) and laugh at him / make (gentle) fun of him over it.", "Least stereotypical AITA comment", "In this case my \"whatever\" meant \"I am not going to waste my evening arguing about something so stupid\" especially when there is no way either one of us have proof. I know for fact I hadn't eaten it apart from the one time when he confronted me as I was doing it.", "When I moved in with him, the agreement we made was me paying groceries and Internet.

Why does it have to be reserved for smoothies? Consumption is consumption. \n\nYour bf sounds like a dick btw.", "That's absolutely not gaslighting. That's disagreeing or arguing. Watch the film.", "Personally I fear he is projecting his feelings of low self-worth onto you. I feel you need to sit him down and have a very serious conversation about him putting you down and making you feel bad as his way of venting his frustrations and anger at his current health and employment situation. His coping mechanisms are not healthy and he will steadily escalate his behaviour, crossing the line into toxic and abusive behaviour. \nPlease don\u2019t remain in this relationship because he won\u2019t be able to afford a home and groceries without you. You aren\u2019t required to set yourself on fire to keep his insecurities warm.", "At one point he said \"It doesn't matter if you did, just be honest\" - but I literally didn't do it. He says he's just shocked that the yogurt was being used so quickly, but I hadn't touched it before he confronted me about it.", "Yelling is a trigger for him as his father is bipolar and used to freak out randomly.
