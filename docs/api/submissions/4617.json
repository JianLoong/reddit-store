This is a case of child neglect, and getting CPS involved is the right thing to do.\n\nPeople have a fundamental misunderstanding about the role of CPS. Do they remove kids deemed to be in danger? Yes. But their primary goal is to keep families together and *prevention* is key. CPS prevention units look for what can be done to keep the family together. I\u2019ve seen them provide parenting classes, childcare vouchers, housing vouchers, connect to mental health services, substance abuse treatment, intensive in home services to teach the parents how to clean, etc. There may be a simple solution to fix what\u2019s going wrong here, and if so CPS would rather have that happen than the trauma and expense of removal (foster care costs a LOT more money than the services I listed above). Regardless the status quo is not working, and authorities needed to become involved\n\nNTA", "NTA - 1. All round both kids are too young 2. Sneaking out the house to see his gf at 12? Thats crazy", "NTA. All you did was make a decision in the kid's best interests where they didn't even communicate with you. They sound delusional and neglectful. Regardless of the flack you'll get from the parents, you looked after their child when they didn't.", "NTA - the parent in you was clearly much stronger than her parents. That's simply too young to be fending for yourself. 12yo sneaking to his girlfriends? Neither parents know where their kids are? Goodness me it might be for the better that the CPS are involved. Imo you did the right thing & shouldn't hesitate to do the same if the situation ever arises again. Brownie points for you & none for them.", " NTA. That\u2019s crazy. And isn\u2019t it funny how their phones miraculously started working after the police were involved?\n\nI once was asked by another parent for a playdate in the park with our then 6-7 year olds. The father then said he had an errand to run, and would I mind watching both kids for about 30? I was pissed that he hoodwinked me into this, but I said ok, because my kid was having fun.\n\nHe came back 3 hours later. \n\nThat was our last play date.", "NTA.  It sounds like CPS needs to get involved here.  You did the right thing.", "From what you say, it sounds like you had 4 options\n\n1) an impromptu sleep-over at your house. (Which could/would have resulted in great drama when the other parents eventually got home.)\n\n2) Drive her to her house and wait with in your car with her until someone got home. (cold)\n\n3) Follow her parent's plan and drop her at her house to wait alone until someone got home (also cold)\n\n4) Do what you did. And parents can deal with the fall-out from officialdom.\n\nIt sounds like her brother is in for some trouble by abandoning his sister, but that's not your problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  The parents should be investigated.", "More info, how old is the child? Does she have a key to the house or does she have to wait for someone to let her in?", "NTA. CPS needed to be involved because it\u2019s so dangerous to leave their 8 year old outside alone until 2:00 AM. Also their 12 year old shouldn\u2019t be walking alone in the dark to come get her. Don\u2019t feel bad for protecting a child.", "NTA, that kid, and her brother, need help and CPS needs to be involved. Maybe this is a wake-up call to the parents, maybe not, but either way, you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. 8 is way too young to be hanging outside a house until late at night.", "They aren't being investigated because you got the police involved, they are being investigated because they are failing to clear the absolute lowest bar of parenthood.", "INFO: what are the ages of the children, including the brother?", "Absolutely NTA. This child is 8 years old!!!", "NTA - dang, this poor kid. Of course it was appropriate to get them involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It actually got so bad that one mom (someone in your shoes) made the guest room up for me so I would have a safe place and be welcomed at the table. \nI was in foster care for a little because a neighbor called cps. There is a time and a place where that\u2019s the solution but it sounds like you just wanted to prove a point to the parents at the cost of your daughter\u2019s friend.\nShe knows her home life isn\u2019t ideal. Don\u2019t think the parents want to be at work till 10 either. \nAnd if you\u2019re so worried about 10p, why did this take until 2a?\nWhy couldn\u2019t you just give her pjs and fresh clothes for the next day and make it a \u201cfun surprise school night sleepover!!\u201d And be the nurturing present person you expect the POLICE to be?

Regardless this child is EIGHT. \n\n\u201cLatchkey\u201d kids are one thing. We used to let ourselves in the house after school and be alone for a half hour at a relatively young age (siblings aged 8, 10, 12). That was legal and common practice where we lived. But you can\u2019t abandon your kids for hours at a time, especially late into the night", "shes literally 8.. if she had been older we probably wouldn't have been so worried but this has been an recurring thing for years and if her brother didnt take her home she would be at the front playing (coming from their neighbors and police reports) this isnt new we just didnt know about it...", "Your story is way more crazy than mine. An 8 yo has no business being alone until 10. I get that some families are struggling, but that alone isn\u2019t cool.\n\nAnd the fact that they\u2019re ok with what they did is so fucking crazy that I worry for this kid\u2019s safety. No communication at all is baffling.", "I also have to wonder about the gf's parents. Why do they regularly have him until 9pm at their home? If they know him well enough that they know his parents aren't watching him, they should also know him well enough that he has an unsupervised younger sister. This is also assuming they are home before 9pm and know that their (12 year old?) daughter has a boyfriend and what they are doing together.", "Yikes", "I'm gonna say NTA. I can't understand why you were concerned.", "Then YTA (softly). Should\u2019ve been a sleepover & CPS report the following morning with the school counselor. You had call & text log documentation of parents abandoning and you taking care of her, and then another family member could\u2019ve been arranged to pick her up from school or CPS/foster system direct. Can you imagine being that alone at 8, having a play date, then your parents mad at you for getting the police called on them? (Parents probably made daughter feel like this is her fault because she was playing with your daughter. Reporting and stopping this from continuing was absolutely the right call)", "N", "Why didn\u2019t you call child welfare?

Wherever you happen to be, look up the number for reporting child abuse and keep it handy.", "Alsp expecting a 12 year old to be home alone supervising their 9 year old sibilong seems like a bad idea", "Thank you for this. Folks hear about CPS taking kids from their homes and rightfully understand how terrible that is. The sad thing is, if all the details came to light, they'd see that this extreme and doubtlessly traumatic intervention was actually the best case for these poor kids. It not really that surprising that folks have trouble fathoming how bad it gets before CPS takes this kind of action.", "Depends on the kid. I was a latchkey kid, I took bus home let myself in make myself dinner at 12. That was around mid 2000s. Parents had strict rules though, no friends over, had to answer landline if they called to check in unless previously cleared with them. I think i started babysitting around 13 as well.", "That poor kid is neglected.  Make sure she knows that she can come to you for help if she can't get into her house.  Keep advocating for her.", "The irony is, he\u2019s divorced. And had he asked me to watch his kid, I would have said yes.", "I was latch key too but my parents got home around 4:30, 5 pm not 10 pm.
