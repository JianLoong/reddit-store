Yes. But their primary goal is to keep families together and *prevention* is key. CPS prevention units look for what can be done to keep the family together.

Show them the texts they sent you too.", "I'm just stunned at people who date at that age. Am I the weird one? Probably, but still, sneaking out to a girlfriends house at age 12 seems v strange to me.", "So did you ever find out where her parents were or why they didn\u2019t call back? Just curious. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility to heave on a 12 yo sibling or some random school friend\u2019s parents on a school night without discussing it\u2026.", "Yea a alcoholic/dr&g bender at their friends place", "I flew across country by myself at 11, to babysit my niece and nephew for the summer. This was early 80's, I guess times were different then too, but I begged to do it, and was allowed. Now, my sister did come home for lunch every day to check on us, and I wasn't allowed to cook or anything like that. But, now one of my kids, I wouldn't leave him alone long enough to run to the gas station until he was like 13, because he couldn't handle that. Just depends on the kid. I don't think 9 and 12 here are appropriate in the circumstances.", "I'm hoping they'd just rather have him at their house than let their 12 year old daughter be unsupervised at his house. They aren't responsible for the 8 year old either, but maybe they have had her over when he wasn't sneaking? Or maybe he didn't want his sister tagging along and lied about her being taken care of?", "They're probably living off of microwaved soup and TV dinners. My friend's parents didn't neglect her like this but her mom worked \n7a-7p and her dad worked 4p-4a, so she was on her own for dinner and had to rely on the processed stuff. It was far from ideal, but her parents had to make do and night shift paid a lot more than day shift. My parents always had her over for dinner once a week so she could have a \"family dinner\", although it was usually Wendy's (but at least there was a salad bar!)", "NTA. The abusive \"parents\" are trying to play victim for facing the consequences of their actions. That's what they always do. Stick to your guns!", "NTA This couldn't be allowed to continue.", "You absolutely did the right thing. If a child told me this I would 100% be phoning CPS/the police. In most places it is illegal to leave an 8 year old alone even if they're inside of a house...leaving them OUTSIDE for hours at night is just beyond unacceptable. It's obvious to anyone with half a brain cell what could happen to a little kid alone outside, let alone a little kid who is consistently left unattended for long stretches of time and has no way to get to a safe place. They might as well tattoo \"kidnap me\" on her forehead. \n\nIt is also not appropriate that the 12 yo brother is being parentified at such a young age. Its possible that he's old enough to be considered a babysitter and therefore legally allowed to watch his sister while the parents are away, but if parents aren't coming home until 2 am and/or aren't reachable that is a huge problem. Both kids need help because the situation is abusive.\nHonestly sounds like the parents have a drug problem. \n\nIt's ALWAYS better to err on the side of caution, in favor of the children, than give parents the benefit of the doubt in these types of situation. Too many kids die because people look the other way.", "We later found out they were one a bender of substances both legal and illegal", "When I was a baby my babysitter reported my parents for suspected sexual abuse because of blood in my diaper that was actually from bad diaper rash. CPS had a doctor examine me, determined that I was fine and sent me home. That's all there was to it, it's barely a blip in my parents lives.", "This is a sidebar, but you should be aware that there **has** been a lot of abuse of the system to break up Native families, poor families, etc. That's not the situation here, in fact, the \"parents\" in question are exploiting situations like that in playing victim. It's despicable behavior- but not because there's never a legitimate concern in that direction.  \n\n\nThat being said, yes, CPS came into existence because they were needed under our system. This society doesn't do enough to take care of people and kids get stuck with awful parents like these. Any way to get them into a safer environment is good.  \n\n\nWe don't know that the safer environment exists. That's a larger political problem", "Exactly this. People\u2019s minds would be blown spending a single day in a large city\u2019s child protection court room.", "I think it maybe depends how far he had to go. Like if he's just walking a block away to see his gf that doesn't seem insane. But if he's taking a bus to see her that's wild.", "NTA. Really sad situation.", "NTA\n\nThat poor girl. I can\u2019t even fathom leaving a child that young to just wait around outside because the parents can\u2019t be bothered to come home.", "NTA. The authorities NEEDED to be involved. This child is being neglected.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "All yall talking about what CPS actually does makes me feel better about the fact I may wind up having to report a family member\n\n\nOP did what they felt was right and they're NTA for doing so. It was a reasonable reaction", "I don\u2019t know how many CPS social workers and foster parents you\u2019ve spoken to recently to say these things, but there\u2019s VERY little reality and truth to what you wrote. Signed, an actual child welfare social worker", "NTA they didn\u2019t once try to check in with the kids before 2am and ignored your calls. They should be in prison.", "NTA, I'm with your actions 100%", "The problem here is not that she is home alone but that she is locked out of the house until late at night.", "I was one. In 2 states. And the people I know are still having these same issues. If you're in the US, I'm 100% grateful to learn these things aren't true where you are. 1000%", "To be fair, I\u2019m the younger of a 3 year age gap and I was typically the one keeping my older brother in line or we just were hanging out together lol. Depends on the maturity of the kids and the nature of the household. In this situation though these children were put in unsafe conditions"]}
