Or occasionally \u201chi, welcome to Starbucks, would you like to try [food item] today?\u201d I always try to respond by acknowledging what they\u2019ve said, like, \u201cno thanks, I\u2019d just like a \u2026\u201d but employees have to realize that frequently they run through the script very fast, and the speakers are poor, and there\u2019s background street noise, I don\u2019t always catch exactly what they\u2019ve said. In those cases I would just start my order. No offense, but that is why we\u2019re both here.", "If someone is doing the drive thru, my guess is they either don't want to interact with anyone or they're in a hurry.

I don't get the idea that he was 'treating him less' just because he jumped into his order. I don't want pleasantries, whether I am the employee or the customer.

I say YTA because u responded to politeness with rudeness.\n\nPeople who work in service industries are routinely disrespected in ways u might not believe...

Polite conversation is okay in person but I guarantee these same people would rage if the person ahead of them is slow at the drive thru, and in this case it was the *employee* who escalated for no fucking reason. \n\nNobody starts with \u201chi, how are you?\u201d at the drive thru (or over the phone orders), it\u2019s always \u201chi, what can I get for you?\u201d so that the next sentence the customer says is their order. In the rare occasion they do, none of them have gotten offended at me for not greeting them back and launching into my order. \n\nOP was a bit terse but they probably instinctually started their order as most people do in the drive thru or over the phone.", "agree 100%", "Taco Bell always gets me because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the recording or a real person.  Lol.", "Ohhh no expectations of basic maners and human decency", "I don't know if I would have had the same reaction you did, but the barista definitely would have gotten some stink eye and sarcasm from me.

Maybe they are hard of hearing, maybe they were rolling their window down too late and only caught the last word or two, maybe they were looking at the menu and zoned out. Maybe they were having a shitty day and didn't want to put that out there *or* put on a happy face. Sometimes common courtesy just doesn't happen, and taking it as a slight against you *and* lecturing a customer about it is ridiculous.  \n  \nI am courteous and grateful to the people working the drive thru because I'm sure it's a tough job and being polite is usually very simple. But holy cow this guy absolutely deserved the snark that OP gave right back.", "Yeah, I quit saying fine and started telling the truth. \"My uncle just got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and I didn't sleep well\".

I used to get up at 3:30 am to open my store up by 4:45 so everyone could have coffee.

That's not the same thing at all.  I agree that OP was NTA.  The barista was way out of line by 1) forcing OP to \"chat\" instead of doing his damn job and taking the order, and 2) then by lecturing him.

I don\u2019t think so. They both were but don\u2019t try to police how I place my order at the drive through.

Greeting people is a basic courtesy.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but it\u2019s not a personal question.

Take your angst somewhere else", "Tbh I agree with this, and I really hate the question the more I listen to it. I also don't like that if I feel bad then they want me to lie and say I am good; it's rude to force someone to tell lies about themselves.", "If this is even real I would say ESH. They were both rude and patronizing.

Take the order and move on to the next person.", "True...BUT u don't wanna piss off someone with access to your food or drink.", "I mean, he's right though. If OP spoke to anyone who wasn't in the service industry like this it would undeniably be incredibly rude.

Like, you cannot tell me repeating \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d as a lesson was a polite action.", "Good on you for recognizing and owning up to it. Guy was definitely in the wrong - he won\u2019t last long in retail. But I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s never as satisfying as I expect to return rudeness for rudeness.

Now.\"\n\n\"That was really rude\"\n\n\"Look, I don't give f*ck about you. I'm not interested in having a conversation. Now do things for me because that's your job.\"\n\n\n\nLike...how is that person not a complete AH? Why is it OK for you to treat people like that just because they have to \"serve\" you?", "I totally agree with your assessment of the original interaction.  Easy N T A if it ended there.  I voted ESH because I think OP went a little far at the window, getting into a back and forth with the server and being rude about it.  Not that I blame them for it, I would certainly not be polite, but the fight was unnecessary and I think they crossed the line into AH territory.\n\nThey were throwing insults at the end.  I think ESH is fair.", "not in the transcript above. Where are you seeing that?", "I have. I do speak to employees like they're human beings, though, so maybe that's the difference?", "AHHH thank you!", "And you were paying to be lectured! No, I'm sorry. I don't support rudeness, but this wasn't just an interaction with someone, it was a transaction. Is customer service a little dehumanizing? Sure, but that's the gig.", "You weren't in the mood to get called out by someone you think is beneath you.", "I know, its hard to stay level headed.  But these things only bother you as much as you let it. \n\n\n\nAnd the truth is, if you would have just continued on, and not gave into it, they probably would have ended up more angry because they didn't get a reaction.  Its a win win really.\n\nYou wouldn't have to worry about a fast food employee spitting in your food, and would get the satisfaction of knowing this person is picking fights with customers at their job.\n\n\n\nI totally understand not wanting to have a full conversation tho, I don't think its really necessary especially if you're in a rush.\n\n\n\n(Side note: Starbucks now has a tip feature on their machines, and I hate it.

And then continue with the interaction like normal because I made my point. Stopping to point out why you did that is very weird and extra. Why even ask again, why not just go off about it to start with at that point", "Because OP was not speaking to them like a human? I get that we're used to grinding \"service people\" into submission, but seriously? OP would probably never speak to anyone they had any respect for like this.", "Not in the drive thru. You don't go off script, ask open ended questions, or chat in the DT. If they wanted to talk, they need to work the front counter.", "If it's not literal then he shouldn't have minded that she didn't answer the question.", "I know that, but find it odd. There should be some changes in decorum over time and I find it's time to retire that one. But I've also rarely used many common courtesies as we don't have much of that here.", "As someone who has also worked a DT for years. Please stay on script. Wasting time and running up the DT clock literally costs employees money and benefits depending on where you're working. I lost out on over $1000 of bonuses while I was working minimum wage because of one girl who wouldn't just take orders and hand food out the window. She single handedly brought the stats down for our entire shift and our entire store.", "I am sorry, but if any rando decided they need to \"teach me a lesson\" out of the blue, I am probably not going to be particularly polite to them. While OP matched the employee's behavior, every escalation I see was on the part of the employee first.", "He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings", "I don\u2019t think we know enough about the interaction to make that comparison.  Sure, demanding something \u201cnow\u201d from a secretary is obviously rude, but if they\u2019re just like \u201cCan I get the number five with a coke?\u201d, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily intending on dehumanizing the server.  \n\nAlso, drive throughs are generally a transactional, no frills interaction that really isn\u2019t about the face-to-face personable connection. The driver is talking to a metal pole and billboard.  I think it\u2019s easier to be less personable in that situation.", "Perhaps, but I would not personally react well to being educated by someone who demonstrates smug, artificial politeness.  This evidenced by their immediate resort to passive aggressive teaching methods that I would consider rude and impolite.", "If you want to keep your job, don't try to teach lessons to people in the drive-thru.", "It's a drive thru. You don't ask open ended questions or chat about your day. You order, pay, and leave.", "The point is this isn't unusual for Starbucks and they OFTEN come out swinging and face no repercussions. There's not even a point in complaining.", "I do phone service and at least one person everyday skips right past my, \"*How are you?\"* and just starts talking about what they want. Another bunch will say, \"*Fine. I want . . .\"* not ask me how I am.  \n\nI think it's rude af but I would never say that to a customer.", "There is no question that OP was rude. And yes, service workers deserve at the very least basic respect (they deserve a lot more IMO).", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude to not actually answer the \u201chow are you\u201d part, I think it\u2019s very rude to not say \u201chi\u201d back", "Yeah I get where you\u2019re coming from\u2014it would be nice to not have to answer the question.

I don't just mean \"was polite,\" but like looked me in the eyes and was actually present. I had forgotten to even treat myself like a person for a bit. We get so many disgustingly atrocious interactions, like being cussed out and having food thrown at us for nothing, it would be nice if people could do the bare minimum of at least acting politely and returning a simple greeting. I don't get people like OP; politeness isn't a waste of your time, it's the bare minimum to exist beside other people.", "That is very true but it was not cool for the dude to attack him for not answering. Many autistic people have issues with situations like this and attacking someone does not help.", "Lol just Google something like \"drive-thru employee loses job\". \n\nThere are plenty of stories of restaurant employees getting shitcanned by corporate. \n\nYou may run your restaurants a certain way, but in general, an employee that acts the way the employee in OPs story acts is going to get shitcanned sooner rather than later, even if they are morally in the right.", "> politeness isn't a waste of your time\n\nNot only that, but politeness costs nothing and it gives so much.  \n\nBeing in the service industry doesn't make anyone \"less than\" and anyone in that industry absolutely should be afforded kindness - especially because so many people are so self-absorbed.", "Totally. It was blown out of proportion response.", ">Not only that, but politeness costs nothing and it gives so much. \n\nThis is so well said. It literally saved my life as a teenager, I was in a horrible depression spiral and feeling less and less human everyday. People's self-absorbed bullshit can only create callousness, isolation, and pain. On the flip side, being kind makes me feel a little happier, as did receiving kindness - a kind and smooth interaction makes all involved feel a bit brighter. Why would anyone not want that?", "The only thing I can figure is, hurt people hurt people. \n\nThere are so many that are so badly broken they can't even conceive of being kind because when they've tried to be kind it was slapped down time and time again. That would make anyone callous and jaded.\n\nThis is why kindness is so important though. Broken people need kindess the most.", "The funny part is, as a person with C-PTSD who knows a lot of other people with severe trauma, we're usually the politest ones because we know the value of kindness! There are definitely those who go the opposite way, but they tend to be at least somewhat enabled by their environment/others vs being made a constant monster by their abusers; in other words, on paper at least, they \"had it better\" and ended up worse. In my experience, it's people who've not lived extreme enough lives to know the impacts of their actions on others who act like OP did."]}
