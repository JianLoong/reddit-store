That's just plain disgusting and in light of what's going on the world these past two years, with old diseases resurfacing as well, your mother should know better.

Also it's pretty dangerous for her to assume that because she loves your son that God's is going to make sure your son doesn't get sick.  That's not how germs work. \n\nYour reaction wasn't uncalled for either.  She needs to realize that actions like this aren't acceptable anymore.

I laughed at her line about \"germs from my own family.\" Like a flu germ or a cold germ can't spread to other family members? \n\nMaybe take her with you when you next take your kid to the doctor, and have the doc explain things to her.", "NTA just tell her that you were offended that she can tell you how to act and talk to her as a mother but that she wouldn\u2019t allow you to do as you please as a mother to your own son. If she can do it, why can\u2019t you? Seems more offensive to me", "Nta. You told her not to do it and she did it anyway and got defensive.

The only one that \"should\" do something like this is a persons S/O because they already swapping spit etc. If it's gone to the floor, I'd say no.", "NTA Neither spit nor water kill diseases. That was a terrible thing to do! Also babies aren\u2019t born with the bacteria that cause cavities, they get them from adults doing stuff like this. Google it. It\u2019s especially bad since babies can\u2019t brush and a lot of parents don\u2019t brush for them. A two year old with rotting teeth is a sad sight. I\u2019ve worked in a dental office and this has happened more than once.

Anything nasty, including cavities!!!!, can be shared to them. Yes, building an immune system is important (until about 8yo), but licking and returning anything is unhygienic, unsanitary, and as a borderline misophobe, yucky.\nAnd I assume you're at least 18, so unless you're financially dependent on your mother, you can say whatever you like.
