I will be honest in saying I don\u2019t think they are ready for this. They have been together for less than a year, but she is due in July. Obviously I know that things happen, so we are doing our best to embrace it. I\u2019m excited to meet this new little person. \n\n\r\nAnyways, Kate\u2019s family is uninvolved \u2013 they honestly weren\u2019t great parents to begin with, but when they found out they kicked their pregnant 17 year old to the streets. My son and her were living with me until 2 weeks ago when they got their first apartment \u2013 I am extremely proud of them. We had a room set up for the baby, but since they got their own place, I let them take all the baby items I purchased. I mean a fully furnished nursery, and then of course everything from the shower \u2013 that baby isn\u2019t going to be wanting for much. \n\n\r\nWell, the baby is breech. They have tried everything to get that baby to turn, but nothing! So, they have an C-section scheduled for July 3rd assuming the baby doesn\u2019t flip\\she goes into labor. I requested this day off of work, and then asked my son and Kate  if they would like me to pick them up or if they planned to have my son drive them. My son was confused and told me that he would drive them, why would I drive them? I told him I was just offering, and told him I\u2019d be in the waiting room waiting for her to get out of surgery. Then Kate jumped in and said they weren\u2019t having any visitors at the hospital. She said she needed time to heal, and they wanted to bond with the baby. She said it would just be the two of them and her sister. \n\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit I was pretty taken aback \u2013 I mean, I feel like as the grandparent I\u2019m closer then the aunt \u2013 but whatever. I said okay because I didn\u2019t want to fight, and said I would be waiting at their house. Kate jumped back in and said the only visitor they would be having was her older sister. She said she would be in pain, bleeding, and trying to breastfeed, and that she wanted privacy to do that. She also said that I never got my TDAP booster (which I don\u2019t need as I had it maybe 5 years ago when I had to go to the ER for a cut), so I couldn\u2019t come until the baby had its first shots or I got the shot. I pointed out to her if she didn\u2019t have a vaginal birth that she wouldn\u2019t be bleeding and it would just be a surgery recovery and she could stay in the bedroom and relax and my son could bring her the baby when its hungry. She told me that \u2018nobody was taking her newborn from her\u2019. Lots of other things were said, and I feel extremely taken advantage of. I sheltered and provided for her and my son and I didn\u2019t have to  - plus I gifted them a lot. I now see a lot of other narc tendencies from her, and I feel like its WWIII with my poor boy caught in the middle. \n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel like an asshole, but she and my son are saying I am. AITA?\n\nEdit to add:\n1. I'm a man. \n\n2. I see now that I have been the ass in several ways, so I'm going to just apologize to keep the peace and accept that I'll have to wait.", "created_utc": 1687376786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fhcla/aita_for_expecting_to_meet_my_grandchild/", "score": 1018, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The bleeding comes from the placenta detaching from the uterus, it's bleedy!\n\nSecond, you need a TDAP booster. Five years is not recent enough for a newborn.\n\nThird, Kate wants to sit at home and hold her baby and her boyfriend and cry. She does *not* want to dress, shower or sit up in bed, let alone host people. The fuck. Your response to \"I just want to bond with my baby in hospital\" was \"I'll be *waiting at your house*\"?? The fuck?? Have you forgotten what it was like when you'd just given birth?\n\nFourth, hinting until you're given a hard \"no\" then complaining that someone was rude? Bad look.\n\nYour little dig at the end about \"narc tendencies\" reads a lot like \"every accusation is a confession\". Also a bad look.\n\nShe obviously doesn't come from a close or supportive family (Sister excepted). That does damage. She's also shown that she's ready and willing to lose family over this baby. You're in the wrong anyway - you've overstepped massively and by the sounds of it were pretty insulting. \"Lots of other things were said\" hides less than you'd like to think it does. Apologize, get your TDAP shot, *wait for an invitation to visit*. You fucked up big, own it and your relationship with your family has a chance. Get defensive, or turn the \"gift\" of furniture into an obligation, and find out how soon they'll cut you out.", "YTA - 1) you are factually wrong about bleeding. I have had 3 C-sections and bled for 4-6 weeks afterwards. The bleeding is lochia and every woman experiences it after birth regardless of how she delivered 2) it\u2019s extremely common now for parents to take the first few days to bond alone with their baby. It\u2019s not a personal thing against you specifically. 3) as for her older sister being there, she\u2019s most likely there to take care of her sister not just to see the new baby, and YES there is a big difference in that. 4) If she is requesting you get the shot, get the damn shot or show proof that you have had it recently enough to not need a booster.", "You absolutely bleed after a C-section, first of all\n\nSecond of all, YTA and it sounds like \u201cyour poor boy\u201d is on his girlfriend\u2019s side. Stop taking it so personally", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to inform someone you will be at the hospital for their medical procedure. Nor do you get to inform someone you will be at their home waiting for them to arrive with their new baby. You are seriously overstepping and supporting them/giving gifts doesn\u2019t permit you to act this way.\n\nConsider this: even if you weren\u2019t TA here (and you are), you are much more likely to have a close relationship with your grandchild if you respect his/her mother\u2019s wishes and boundaries. Don\u2019t get in your own way. \n\nAlso consider how scary it would be to become a new mom at 18. Teen pregnancy is already stigmatized enough, she doesn\u2019t need you judging her when she\u2019s in the most vulnerable state of her life. And your \u201cpoor boy\u201d knocked her up and is responsible for that and for stepping up now to be a good father and partner, which means respecting the wishes of the mother of his child. \n\nLots of MIL-DIL relationships go sour quickly because MIL is uncomfortable with her son prioritizing his wife or partner over MIL. But of course, that\u2019s what the son SHOULD be doing. Don\u2019t become this cliche!!\n\nLastly, you need to read the Lemon Clot essay. Hopefully it will help you understand and respect your DIL\u2019s needs regarding privacy.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/3fijct/the_lemon_clot_essay_for_moms_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "YTA.\n\nShe is going to be recovering from surgery. If she doesn't want visitors, respect it. You'll see the baby when she's up for visitors.", "YTA are you kidding.  Waiting for them at their house. Get a grip. And FYI,  c section here. Still bled after birth.  Maybe educate yourself.", "I didn\u2019t even need to read past the title to know YTA. However, I did. This is classic you owe me parent behavior. Yikes, back off before you do more damage.", "YTA. No one is entitled to a child especially if your not the parent. While yes everything you did was wonderful it doesn\u2019t matter right now. You say the baby is breach and both the girl and your son are young. As a mother yourself I\u2019m sure you understand how stressful this girl must be and how crazy her hormones are. She\u2019s going to need a serious surgery and due to the baby being breach you don\u2019t know if the baby will have any medical issues\u2026 they both will need time to heal. Nothing she said to you is out of the norm or narcissistic it\u2019s just taking precaution to ensure her and the baby\u2019s health. You need to start looking at this more like \u201coh my grandchild and the mother of my grandchild are healing right now\u201d not \u201c I need to see my grandchild you narcissist\u201d see how those two things sound different. How you treat them after they have they this baby will determine if your any of their lives or not. I always love the saying would you rather be right or rather have the people you love around you? I wish the best to you all", "YTA\n\nBabies don't spoil, you meet the baby when the parents are ready for you to do so.\n\nYou are wrong about the bleeding, and it makes me wonder what else you've said to them.\n\nGF is very clear and it's not about Aunt vs Grandma, its about wanting her SISTER, with her during this time, not her boyfriend's mother.\n\nYou helped them out, that is kind and wonderful. Give them time and respect their role as the babies' parents. They will do things differently they you would at times, and you need to let them find their way.", "YTA - You're closer to the baby than the mothers sister how exactly? How do those mental gymnastics work? And talk about narcissistic tendencies, you're literally saying you're entitled to be in the hospital because you bought them things. \n\nAlso, a tdap vaccine is recommended for anyone that is going to around a newborn for an extended period of time.", "You should of warned them your \"generosity\" came with a lot of strings attached. How about you show this new-to-be mom some respect and privacy while recovering from a life-altering event?\nYTA", "YTA. Get the booster, don\u2019t quibble. Ask when you can see the child and how you can help the most. Read The Lemon Clot essay and about The Fourth Trimester. Get over yourself and apologize.", "YTA. This is pretty normal for some people to want to nest with just them, for a period of time. Some people want the visitors right away, some people want like the first few weeks or months even by themselves. They\u2019re both totally valid but your son and his GF are in the latter category, so unfortunately you need to accept that. If Kate\u2019s parents disowned her than her sister is the closest thing she has to a mom right now so it\u2019s understandable to me why she would want that family support during this difficult time. \n\nTry to be understanding. You will get to meet the grandchild, just not on your exact terms. It\u2019s their baby, remember. Tread carefully here or you risk really setting a bad tone for the rest of your relationship with Kate who will remember how you pushed and pushed and boundary stomped forever", "YTA\nIt\u2019s her first child, it will take a lot out of her and your son. If the mother wants no visitors apart from her sister, leave her be. Let them settle with their new baby, if they need help they will ask and buying them things for the baby does not mean you will be the first person to see the baby, again it is down to the mother and father to decide.", "YTA. \n\nThe only person who gets a say in this scenario is Kate. She is the one putting her body through physical and emotional pain that you can't even comprehend. She doesn't want you there, that's that. If you want to be able to see your grandchild at all, I *highly* suggest you step back and do whatever you can to support Kate instead of focusing on what you want.", "YTA\n\nWomen are very vulnerable during birth/birthing procedures, especially if she's so young and it was unplanned.  She needs people she feels close to and feels safe showing her vulnerabilities around. C sections can be equally traumatic as vaginal birth so she needs that supporting environment. It is also natural that she will want to be with her child and partner after the delivery for them to bond as a family.\n\nIt's only turning into WWIII because you aren't respecting her or their needs or wishes. If you feel so aggrieved that they moved out to be a family together ask for the stuff back. Just don't be surprised if you lose your son and grandchild from that though.", "1) You do bleed after a C-section just like a vaginal birth for like 6 weeks. I\u2019ve had both kinds of births.\n2) You should get your shots as requested to protect the baby from whooping cough which is now commonly requested of those around newborns.\n3) This is not about you the mother of the child has chosen a support person for her which is her sister that has nothing to do with your status as grandmother to the child.\n\nYTA for not listening to the mother and fathers wishes. Do better or we will see you on JNMIL.", "YTA. The baby won't even remember this, but the mom will remember how you treated her.  The baby might be your grandchild, but this is her baby and her birth experience. Don't take this personally, she just wants to have some privacy with her newborn baby.", "Gifts aren\u2019t really gifts when they come with that many strings. Recovery from a c-section is no joke and it\u2019s beyond arrogant to treat her like nothing more than an incubator and food source with your \u2018you can stay in the bedroom and son can bring you the baby when the baby is hungry\u2019 comment.\n\nThey have expressed their desire to have time to heal and bond as a family before welcoming guests to meet the new arrival. That boundary is reasonable and should be respected if you want to have ANY future contact with your grandchild. YTA", "YTA\n\nIt's your grandchild not your child. You don't decide anything here, the child's parents do.\n\nYou need to apologize for being pushy and back off.", "YTA. \n\nFirst - vaginal bleeding DOES happen even after c section. \n\nSecond - SHE feels more comfortable being vulnerable around HER sister. Regardless the title to the baby, it's about who SHE feels comfortable healing in front of.\n\nThird - your title to the child doesn't ENTITLE you to the child.\n\nFourth - renew your fucking tdap. It does no harm to you to protect a NEWBORN from whooping cough. \n\n\n\nThe narc tendencies I see here are your own. Your entitlement to a woman who isn't your child. Wanting her to bleed and breastfeed in front of you which is clearly something she says she's uncomfortable with. \"I gifted them a lot so I should be allowed to take her baby from her arms when I come to her house on my own terms because I feel entitled to her child\"", "YTA. After I had my baby the visitors were such a challenge. I had a long and hard delivery, hadn't slept for days and no one took that into consideration because they wanted to see the baby. I had a C-section and the pain I was in was terrible. Trying to breastfeed and having visitors at the house was something I would never do again. You get to see the baby when they are ready for you to see the baby. PERIOD.", "*<I\u2019m excited to meet this new little person.>*\n\nYes you are. And you're totally dismissing the mother of that new little person. It seems she's nothing more than an incubator to you, and you're extremely and **solely** focussed on getting that baby in YOUR life, instead of being respectful and being ALLOWED te be a part of HIS/HER life. \n\n<*she could stay in the bedroom and relax and my son could bring her the baby when its hungry.>*\n\nYou wanted to sit there, play family with your son and their baby, and let the mom have her baby just to feed it?????\n\nFor this alone YTA\n\n<*I feel like as the grandparent I\u2019m closer then the aunt>*\n\nKate is in a very vulnerable situation.

You are not her mother and she is likely feeling uncomfortable around you and pressured about doing everything \"correctly.\"\n\nBest thing you can do is back off and be supportive of what they need and want when they need and want it.  Stop putting your desires first.", "I see a lot of narc tendencies here too, but they\u2019re all coming from you. This is their baby and the birth is not about you and what you want. As the grandparent, you need to step back and give them space to adjust to being new parents and bond with their baby.

Why are you making assumptions like this? \n\nHer SO can \u201cbring her the baby when it\u2019s hungry\u201d? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. This time is all about the parents (not grandparents) bonding with the baby- it\u2019s absolutely inappropriate to treat her like she\u2019s just the secondary/feeding source. This is probably the most disgusting part of this post. No wonder she hates you! Your comment clearly defines why she wants her sister there and not you- you absolutely plan to \u201ccare for the baby\u201d (aka hog the baby from her) however her sister will be helping her with housework/baby cares/other tasks. Not playing mommy like you intend to do. \n\nDid you get the nursery items to support the baby? Or to hold it over their heads? Because regardless or where it\u2019s used (your place or theirs) it\u2019s still serving the baby. That was the intended use of purchasing the items, correct? \n\nYou are not at all entitled to be at the birth, in the waiting room, or showing up at their home. It\u2019s not your baby, and regardless of how much you supported them financially, it\u2019s not your decision.

This is their baby and they 100% have the right to decide who is present and who visits on what timeline.

You still vaginally bleed for weeks after a C-Section. The bleeding is caused by the placenta tearing itself away from the wall of the uterus and this happens no matter how the baby is delivered.\n\nRemember, they are the parents now.

I had a c-section, you definitely still bleed. Her baby her choice. It\u2019s a major surgery with an added rush of hormones and anxiety. If you gave that stuff on the condition of dictating the relationship, you made a poor choice. Also, letting them keep the shower gifts says a lot about you. Family and friends gave them those gifts and you can\u2019t withhold them because you didn\u2019t get your way and don\u2019t want to respect their boundaries.

Although it may hurt your feelings, she is telling you what she wants, and you don't care what she wants.  She wants some privacy.  Her sister is most likely closer to her than you are.  You keep pushing back to have your way, and she clearly doesn't feel comfortable.  It is very supportive that you housed them during a rough time, but that doesn't entitle you to have a bigger say than she does.  It sounds like you've done things more to hold over them than out of the kindness of your heart.  This is a problem I have with my mother.  She feels owed or entitled to things she's not.  I'm not trying to be mean.  Maybe telling her you're super excited and don't want to overstep, and if she can let you know as soon as she's up to have you visit, please.

You never asked what they were comfortable with.", "The narc tendencies are actually coming off of you, not her. YTA.

Her sister is there as her closest support person. The person having the baby, and only her, gets to decide who will and won't be at the hospital with them.

I mean a fully furnished nursery, and then of course everything from the shower \u2013 that baby isn\u2019t going to be wanting for much. \n\n\r\nWell, the baby is breech. They have tried everything to get that baby to turn, but nothing! So, they have an C-section scheduled for July 3rd assuming the baby doesn\u2019t flip\\she goes into labor. I requested this day off of work, and then asked my son and K  if they would like me to pick them up or if they planned to have my son drive them. My son was confused and told me that he would drive them, why would I drive them? I told him I was just offering, and told him I\u2019d be in the waiting room waiting for her to get out of surgery. Then K jumped in and said they weren\u2019t having any visitors at the hospital. She said she needed time to heal, and they wanted to bond with the baby. She said it would just be the two of them and her sister. \n\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit I was pretty taken aback \u2013 I mean, I feel like as the grandparent I\u2019m closer then the aunt \u2013 but whatever. I said okay because I didn\u2019t want to fight, and said I would be waiting at their house. K jumped back in and said the only visitor they would be having was her older sister. She said she would be in pain, bleeding, and trying to breastfeed, and that she wanted privacy to do that. She also said that I never got my TDAP booster (which I don\u2019t need as I had it maybe 5 years ago when I had to go to the ER for a cut), so I couldn\u2019t come until the baby had its first shots or I got the shot. I pointed out to her if she didn\u2019t have a vaginal birth that she wouldn\u2019t be bleeding and it would just be a surgery recovery and she could stay in the bedroom and relax and my son could bring her the baby when its hungry. She told me that \u2018nobody was taking her newborn from her\u2019. Lots of other things were said, and I feel extremely taken advantage of. I sheltered and provided for her and my son and I didn\u2019t have to  - plus I gifted them a lot. I now see a lot of other narc tendencies from her, and I feel like its WWIII with my poor boy caught in the middle. \n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel like an asshole, but she and my son are saying I am. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.  I know you are excited to meet this grandchild - I'm a grandparent myself.  But, you've never given birth.  Your son's GF is 17, likely extremely nervous, doesn't have her own mom to count on, and wanting a few days of space is extremely reasonable.  Don't blow the good relationship you have with both of them over this.  You have your grandchild's entire lifetime to spend time with her.  It's hard - but grant your son's GF this space.  In the long run, you won't regret it.  Her wanting a few days on her own with her baby is hardly narcissistic - but your behavior is questionable, particularly since you are justifying it by doing what any reasonable parent would do in the circumstances.", "Soft YTA \nYou have been wonderfully supportive and I am sure that will continue. Remember that your son and his partner are now learning what it means to be parents and become a family unit. It will be hard but you need to let them do what they think is best and let them ask you for advice and help on their terms. \n\nI\u2019m going to explain as best I can the main things that I want to address: \n1) the TDAP booster\n2) respect for the boundaries the new parents are asking for\n3) choose of support/visitors at hospital\n4) c-section delivery\n\n1: It sounds like they have ex pressed that that have wanted you to get an updated TDAP booster and chose not to so they assumed you understood they didn\u2019t want you to be around the baby until the baby has there shots. My understanding is that while technically everyone needs a booster every 10 years, people working with children are often try to get the booster every 5 years so some new parents ask that their close family members (who they expect to have frequent contact with the newborn) to get their booster earlier also. \nIf you have had your booster within the last 5 years then get confirmation of that from your medical record and give that to them or if you can\u2019t get that confirmation then go and get the booster so you can visit your grandchild as soon as the new parents are ready to invite you to do so. Otherwise you will need to respect that they don\u2019t want anyone without a recent booster visiting their child until they have had their boosters (usually 2weeks after the child has their boosters). \n\n2: please respect the boundaries that they are expressing that they want for their new family unit. They are young however are now becoming parents and this is their time to work out how they want to do that for both themselves and their child. Be there to offer advice and accept how they choose to welcome you into their family unit. Try to not see it as them shutting you out but as them learning how to become the adults they need to be to be the best parents then can for their child. If you don\u2019t respect and support how they choose to do things then you will risk not being included or welcome. \nIt is also now very normal for new parents to request to have a week or so from the time of birth or from leaving hospital to be alone with only selected prearranged visitors/helpers. \nRemember that your son is making these decisions just as much as his girlfriend is, they both are deciding what they want as a unit. You may get upset by feeling excluded but this is their time and you need to let them decide how they want it to be. I would suggest you find a way to be supportive without challenging any of the boundaries they have expressed. \nAsk if there is anything you can help with from afar or done with little or no contact. \nAsk if they can give you laundry so you can take it him to wash and fold; and deliver back to their door without visiting until they are ready. \nAsk if you can prepare them a couple of meals to be dropped off for after they return home from the hospital? \nBut also be prepared for a \u201cNo, thank you\u201d \n\n3: the choice of support person(s) is personal and it is the hospital sees it as the pregnant persons choice. Depending on the hospital and type of delivery the new mother may only get to have one or two other people there. Your sons girlfriend has chosen her sister as support and while I understand that is upsetting for you to have not been chosen/included. Please don\u2019t begrudge them that choice. \n\n4: the thought of a c-section delivery was terrifying for me but I had to have one also. It doesn\u2019t mean the mother won\u2019t bleed; she will, just not a heavily or for as long as someone does after a vaginal delivery. The recovery from a c-section is usually not complicate however she will be in pain and will need to restrict lifting anything heavier than the baby or doing certain movements. There will always be the risk of complications. C-section mothers are encouraged to get up and active as best they can as soon as they can to encourage and aid their recovery. Again how they choose to recover and bond with their child is their choice that you need to respect if you want to be a positive part in their lives. \n\n\nFinally, this might be difficult to hear but this is the first test you are facing where you will set the tone for your relationship with your sons\u2019 family. You need to start seeing your son as an adult and a parent who is making the choices he thinks is right for himself, the mother of his child, and his child. Yes, these choices are being made with input from his girlfriend and that is how it should be. Your choice is to respect those choices and the boundaries they are putting in place or you will risk not having any quality relationship with them or your grandchild at all.", "I\u2019m sorry, but YTA here. Problem is that you are assuming that you have the right to be there for delivery and when they come home and full access to the baby. \n\nYou helped them, but you are inserting yourself where you were not invited. \n\n1) This is not your daughter. Girls always prefer their own moms or someone close to them, like a mom or sisters. You don\u2019t fill this role. You are the mother of the baby\u2019s father. You are going to be second string. She is 18 and is still not comfortable being at a disadvantage, especially being around someone whom they don\u2019t have that close of a bond. You have that with your son, but not with her, and it is her body that is giving birth. Know your lane. And believe me, should her relationship with her parents improve, you will fall down that ladder even more. - work at giving her the respect that she asks for and the boundaries she asks. She is the mom, and she holds the key to your grandchild.\n\n2) you are overstepping when you seem to think that you have more rights to the grand baby. You don\u2019t \n\n3) young parents, and first time parents want to ensure that their baby is protected. Get the list of shots needed that they are requesting from you, and not one complaint.\n\nList of what your role and requirements are:\n\nAsk them what their rules and boundaries are: example: no kissing the baby, respectful\u2026. And not one negative word from you. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like it. It is not your baby.\n\nWhen you want to visit, no surprise drop by, drive by\u2026 call first, and from your home, not on the road or in the driveway. Get permission first.\n\nNo complaint about not seeing the baby enough.\n\nAsk to hold the baby. Don\u2019t walk up and reach or grab for the baby. This will get her to hate you.\n\nNo kissing the baby, unless said ok. No \u201coops it was an accident, and I couldn\u2019t resist\u201d\n\nNo negative comments to the baby: \u201cis mommy not feeding you enough\u201d, \u201cis mommy pinching you\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t keep saying this that this baby looks like his daddy or nothing like her. That hurts her feelings\n\nWhen mom asks for the baby back, give the baby back right then.\n\nDon\u2019t give your advice unless she asks for it. And don\u2019t assume she asks for it.\n\nDon\u2019t criticize if she bottle feeds or breast feeds none of your business\n\nIf her house is in a disarray, say nothing. NOT ONE WORD. She is busy getting her bearing\u2019s down. You can offer to help with cooking her favorite meal, clean their home, but don\u2019t reorganize. She has it how SHE wants it.\n\nBe her cheerleader, her supporter, and know she is so young, that though she may not have a clue, she does not need you to advise her or criticize her. She will figure it out. We were young once and knew it all. Yes, when we gave birth, within a week, we were taking the baby everywhere to show them off, or family came to visit right away. My fourth one, I was so thankful when grandma gave me a break.\n\nRead your edit. You are a grandpa, oh heck no. No offense, but she doesn\u2019t need a man up in her business. No offense. When I was first pregnant, I demanded a woman doctor, and wanted only females to be around me during delivery. Of course during delivery, I didn\u2019t care. Just get him out! But still, I was very private.", "YTA, and you need to stop talking,  because your edits/comments  REALLY aren't helping you.\n\nBookmark this post, and come back and read it in six months when you're tempted to ask us why your son and his child's mother are NC with you.

Was she planning on having you stay locked up in your room?", "YTA- with all the stuff going around why wouldn\u2019t you want to have the baby be as safe as it can be? Just get the damn shot.\n\nAlso you\u2019re not closer to the mother than her own sister- she wants support and to be comfortable. None of this is about you- it\u2019s about the mother and the father. Step on too many toes now and your future relationships with the mother and your grandchild(ren) are in danger. \n\nWait until they ask for help before butting in", "YTA, a bit. Be available and supportive but stay in your lane. This pregnant girl is feeling extremely vulnerable, back off. She feels safe with her sister and they want time to get their feet wet parenting. The priority is that the baby is safe, nurtured and protected, has a calm and peaceful environment, especially in the first few months. It\u2019s literally critical to brain development. No arguing! Be available for help but with no expectations for the time being. Drop off meals and don\u2019t try to go inside. Drop off diapers. Send sweet cards. If they invite you in, do not overstay or offer unsolicited advice. If you want a good relationship with that baby, the momma needs to be your biggest fan. It\u2019s not your kid.", "YTA. I understand why you\u2019re hurt but this is their call to make. Personally if my child\u2019s grandmother had been supportive throughout the pregnancy, I would allow them to meet their grandchild within the first few days of the birth no matter, what but your son\u2019s gf feels differently and that\u2019s her right. \n\nHere\u2019s the good news for you. The same way she\u2019s setting boundaries, you can do the same. You\u2019re only 42 and you have a lot more living to do, so go do it. Take all of the time and money you thought you would have devoted to helping them raise their child and spend it on yourself. That wouldn\u2019t be an act of revenge either, you would be honoring their wishes by being a grandparent on their terms. If they think they can do this without your hands on assistance, let them. If they succeed, applaud them and if they struggle, set your own boundaries so you don\u2019t spend the rest of your life cleaning up their messes.", "Soft YTA. This isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about two teenagers finding their way. She will be terrified. Be supportive but on their terms.

You see, everything you did for them - you did because you wanted it. If you expect them paying back by including you into their nuclear family, you should tell it beforehand, so they'd have time and means to properly distance without guilt or owing you anything.", "I'm not here to make a judgment either way on this. I just came to correct some things. This is from the CDC - If a teen or adult will be around the baby and has already had a Tdap vaccine, they do not need to get vaccinated again. As in if they've already gotten the tdap vaccine, even just once, they don't NEED a booster shot.", "NTA - they're being totally inconsiderate towards you after the help you brought them.

Just remember how they treated you and stop being so generous.", "I\u2019m on the fence here but leaning towards NTA. I\u2019m (28f) currently 28 weeks pregnant with my first child. My parents and in laws are both wonderfully supportive and it will be both sides first grandchild. I have said no visitors for the first few weeks with the exception of grandparents and aunties and uncles (our siblings). However, they must be up to date with vaccinations ahead of the birth. (They all are anyway as my husband has next to no immune system due to medication \nhe\u2019s on because he has MS). These are the people who have been there for us throughout my pregnancy and supported us. Just please be mindful about recovery, just because she\u2019s having a c-section doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t be bleeding, once baby is delivered, her body will no longer be housing a tiny human so hormones will change and bleeding will start. (Maybe it\u2019s worth doing a little research). And if you can get updated vaccinations, whether you think you need them or not, it will show the new parents that you\u2019re trying to do the best for their little one. As a dad, I think you\u2019ve done an amazing thing with your son and his other half.

Some grandparents want to do everything and be a parent to the new baby as it does take a village to rase a child, she may fear you want to take the babies love because moms can get upset at anything thanks to all the mama bear hormones.  Driving them to the hospital is amazing to offer as some new dads have alot of hormones running through their minds and its safer having some one else drive so they can focus just on mom.  I know it may kill you to wait a week to see your grandchild but mom sets all of her boundaries and you just have to be patient I know it can be really hard to wait but some moms are very afraid of germs while others don't care. Just don't push on it I am sure as long as mom is not crazy you will build a amazing relationship with the child hopefully they might even spend the night there giving parents a chance for date night and some times just a nap.

Just listen to what they need and breathe and I am sure everything will be fine.", "Teetering on Y T A and ESH but voting the latter.

I'd imagine Kate's feeling very scared and vulnerable right now and perhaps OP's enthusiasm is coming off to her as just a but much at this point in time (especially the bit about recovering separate from baby aside from feeding).  Give her space and let son know you're there for support and happy to be a part of the kid's life.\n\nKate is co-AH because she sounds like a bit of a piece of work and supremely ungrateful.
