One bedroom is ours and the other is a multipurpose storage room/guest bedroom and my office since I work from home. \n\nWe recently found out his parents are in debt that will take years to recover from. I don\u2019t mind my partner helping his family financially or getting things they need as long as my life with him isn\u2019t greatly impacted (like him helping pay our bills, food, etc). He recently brought up allowing his little sister, 16, to move into the room that is my office to help his parents not have to support her but I am against it for several reasons:\n\n1) THIS IS MY BIGGEST REASON AGAINST IT: Our sex life and intimacy will be greatly affected. He said he won\u2019t be comfortable doing it if she is here and he would be fine not having sex for MONTHS if it means his sister can move in. I have a way higher labido and would not be able to handle this level of abstinence and I know I would grow resentful of the situation.\n\n2) I do a majority of the cooking (probably 95% of it) and I currently pay for most of the groceries as he pays for our date nights. \n\n3) I tend to do more cleaning as I work from home, I don\u2019t mind cause I love taking care of my partner and he is cleanly so it isn\u2019t too much trouble.\n\n4) We split bills according to our wages, I make a little less then him so I pay about 45% of the rent and utilities and we live in a HIGH cost state. \n\n5) I tend to feel like a third wheel when we are out with his sister, he even calls her \u201cbaby\u201d which I think is weird. He once asked me to pay for my own bill once when us three went out to eat together cause \u201che has to pay for his and her food already.\u201d He also sits by her instead of me at restaurants, family events, or when we are out. \n\nI know if she moves in, I will most likely be the third wheel in our own home and I don\u2019t want to live like this. But I am worried I may be acting selfish and I want my partner to be happy.

But why don't you just move on?", "NTA.\n\nYes, it's tough for their parents but a lot of teenagers that come from families with low incomes get a job even before turning 16...\n\nHe can keep helping them, but he has to learn that his responsibility is now to his partner if he truly plans to have a future with you.\n\nIf he insists on the topic, he is, in my opinion, behaving very strangely and is already proving you how this will be your whole life.\n\nThink very carefully about your next steps.", "NTA. Seems like a clear NO to me. Why be a 3rd wheel in your home and with no intimacy?(because \"baby\" sister is there). That doesn't seem sustainable. I wouldn't even go there. If it's a deal-breaker with this bf who is only 4 years older than you (and has so little libido that he can go for MONTHS without intimacy with you?), then I'd recommend moving on.", "Oh please you can do better. Reading you other posts you dont need neiher you bf or his sister in your life.", "NTA \n\nThere is something so weird about all of this, yuck! Echoing all the others posts, huge red flags.   \nWhere will you work? How will this help his parents? She\u2019s not adding to their mortgage, energy bills, taxes, etc? She can get a job and help them, if it\u2019s that bad. \n\nThis sounds like a permanent plan, not a temporary situation. It also seems like your relationship isn\u2019t his priority, which should be a problem for you.", "NTA. This is a recipe for disaster.\n\nOne of my favorite pieces of advice I received recently: \"Don't give others what is not yours. Give only what is your own.\" \n\nYour boyfriend would be giving not only *his* space, time and attention, but also many things that are *yours.* It is also *your* space, especially your home office. It would be *your* time and energy spent cleaning, and *your* money for groceries. And he's trying to unilaterally cease sexual activity which is for *both* of you! He is willing to sacrifice *your* sexual, mental, and financial health. \n\nHe's trying to give what is not his to give, and that never ends well.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I currently have a friend staying with us in our two-bedroom apartment who came here seeking health care. She's been here for a while and it's *stressful,* even though I like her and she's an adult who contributes to groceries and she even cooks and bakes, and it hasn't impeded our intimacy. We're just too many people crammed into this space nonetheless, and I sometimes rankle at not having my own space any more, even though I don't begrudge her in the end.\n\nIf I were in your situation, I would say absolutely not, because there are far too many complicating factors. My own situation is stressful enough WITHOUT a sudden cessation of intimacy, having to pay any of my own money, or having extra chores.", "NTA \ud83d\udea9 Listen to the comments and reflect on these massive red flags coming from your boyfriend. I don\u2019t believe in ultimatums but clearly stating your boundaries and feelings to your boyfriend is important to do. Once he responds you have your answer. It\u2019s not about saying \u201cdo this or I leave\u201d but simply sharing your thoughts and feelings and if he isn\u2019t willing to compromise or say no to the situation, then you should consider re-evaluating the relationship. Family is important but relationships can be lifetime and it doesn\u2019t sound like a great person to spend your life with who puts others before you", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, but his proposal makes little to no sense to me.  If his parents are in debt, he can help support his little sister monetarily, but there is almost 0 reason that she needs to move into a 780 sqft apartment with her brother and his girlfriend.  I feel like that lack of privacy is absolutely not an appropriate place for his 16-year-old sister to live...are his parents okay with this?  Are they pushing for it?  It seems like an odd family dynamic...\n\nIf you are hoping to marry this guy, really let this be an eye opener for you, because the way he manages his family relationships says A LOT about his mental health and what kind of support you can expect from him in the future.", "Ntam this is really a two yes, one no kind of situation, especially when it sounds like you would end up doing most of the support", "Plot twist: his \u201csister\u201d is actually his daughter just adopted by mom/dad since he was so young\n\nNTA - big dynamic change in your life/relationship", "NTA - red flags the size of earth!", "NTA. Why not lay out these reasons you've listed here to him?", "NTA\n\nHe puts you second when around his sister.  This won't change if she moves in.  It takes 2 yes answers and 1 no answer on big decisions like this.  The 16f is his parents' responsibility, not yours.", "You have certain expectations THAT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE, and it sounds like if she does move in, things are going to change big time - you've clearly outlined it and you clearly know this to be true.  Your points are ALL valid.  If she does move in, it will be all about her needs and wants and bro will be taking care of those.  Sadly, you will have to take it or leave it - and please make decisions on YOUR happiness, not your partners - put yourself first - it's not selfish!  Your happiness and mental health are just as important and you need to be the biggest advocate for yourself - always! NTA", "NTA\n\nThere are 20,000,000 red flags in #2 and #5 on your list. Absolutely not. If she moves in you move out, and let them have their weird sibling bond and you can go find someone that matches your energy and puts you first.\n\nPlus, hell no, 16 years old? Free from parents and a brother who obviously dotes on her excessively. She\u2019s going to be crazy spoiled and you will have to be the bad guy to rein her in when she starts acting out (which she will even if she\u2019s never acted out before, because this level of freedom has never been given to her before), but his family will only see it as jealousy and criticize you while you are trying to help her.\n\nNo. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t even consider it. If your boyfriend insists just dump him, grieve the relationship and move on because this home life is going to make YOU and only YOU absolutely miserable while everybody else is happier than a pig in shit.", "NTA. This is an overstep on his part. \n\nUnless it\u2019s a 2 person HELL YES! , it\u2019s a NO. \n\nYou\u2019re not selfish for choosing yourself over this really BIG ask. \n\nRed flag \ud83d\udea9 thrown.  \ud83d\udc40", "NTA- Have you talked to him about your concerns? Talked about compromises? Expectations? Boundaries? Or is this a \u201cthis is going to happen whether you like it or not\u201d situation?", "NTA\n\nIt's noble of him to want to help his family, but this is a six month relationship and among all the issue this will cause is a unilateral cessation of something you find essential to relationships.\n\nYou may unfortunately be in the position of seeing if you can move in with roommates somewhere or something.", "Your relationship is basically over. He is willing to forgo being intimate with you for months....there is no reason for that. Why would his sister presence means no sex?\nThis is just bizarre.", "NTA, but why is she unable to stay at her parents? You said the dad makes $100k a year, that isn\u2019t chump change. They are adults and should be able to prioritize keeping their child with them.", "NTA, but it goes way past that, since you shouldn't be dating someone like him in the first place. \n\nYou need to get out of this relationship, since he's clearly not a long term partner for you.", "you 100% need to leave this dude. hes had multiple instances of sus/cheating/lying behavior and now hes trying to get his sister to move into your small place against your will. take this as a chance to leave \n\nNTA", "Crazy thought.... is that his daughter that his parents are raising as theirs because he was only 16 when she was born? \n\nI dunno, from the post, they have an odd brother/sister relationship dynamic.", "Your rear view mirror\u2026.put him in it. Now.", "NTA. \n\nThis is a hill to die on. You need to give him a firm NO. It would be nice of him to help..but his parents poor choices, like you said, should have zero affect on your life/relationship.", "Nope. Your feelings about this are legit\n If he wants to help maybe can give her dpending/living money while she lives with your parents.  And/or maybe she can get a part time job. And their relationship sounds a little intense.", "Im assuming from your previous posts it's about the same Boyfriend. I would definitely just get out of that relationship and not think twice.", "NTA\u2026\n\n1.  Are we sure that this is really his baby \u201csister\u201d and not a bio-baby he had at 16 that his parents raised for him as a sibling?  Why else would he go this extreme and refer to her as baby?  Unless he is a creep. \n\n2.  You work from home, most jobs require you to have a dedicated space where you can do that. You would be giving that up in this case. \n\n3.  You don\u2019t want a dead bedroom, he is trying to kill the bedroom. \n\nHonestly OP, you need to take a hard look at this life and ask yourself if this is what you want your future to be.", "NTA here", "Just say no", "NTA.  Why can't he give his parents money? This is red flag city.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is putting you in a no-win situation. He's also making it clear that you're not a priority. And, no sex for an extended period of time?! Honey, just walk away and don't look back. Plenty of fish in the sea; you can do better.", "Based on your comments, he doesn\u2019t seem to view you as equal . Let alone that your opinion matters. Your needs are being thrown away for his sister. With three people would you still be paying 45% of the rent too? Nah make a game plan and move out. I understand you love him and care for him but he clearly doesn\u2019t see the same in you. I get that it\u2019s hard to let go as well, but this is one of those times you need to make a choice. Whether you want this your whole life or not. Cause I know for sure if it comes down to decisions regarding his family you will be left in the dust eating scraps. \n\nThis is a big decision and a hard one. Choosing is hard. Staying is harder. So right now I would go through one final decision, if he overrides it you know he is not the one for you. Give him the alternative, make a compromise. Whatever you need to do to get your point across. But he is not taking you seriously, so start trying to make him. Or this is doomed to fail and leave you heartbroken in the future.\n\nIdk maybe make a list of things you like and don\u2019t like about him and look it over and compare them.  Draw out your feelings, do something and look at your relationship. Look at how you feel, don\u2019t just run away from it. Don\u2019t deflect it. Just look at it. Is it what you want to always feel? That\u2019s about all an internet stranger can say looking from just this one snippet of your life. I also don\u2019t have all the info. He could just do this sometimes. It\u2019s not my decision, it\u2019s not my life. You choose what\u2019s best for you. That\u2019s really the all that I could say.\n\nForgot to add: NTA", "Do you guys want kids?  If a \"young adult\" (edit to correct) sister in an adjacent room is an issue, you are going to have your work cut out for you getting a nut with a kid around.\n\n~~If this was me, I would loudly bang constantly to encourage her to move out, lol.~~  -Didn't catch this was a younger sister and not a situation of her moving in because of her own choices/issues.  I'd still loudly bang, tho.\n\nI (a dude) have a grip of sisters (5), and I am pretty close with them.  From what you posted, his dynamic with his sis is a little weird, my opinion.  \n\nI 100% was getting down in my room back in the day when I lived at home (sorry, not sorry, dad) with zero thoughts of what they thought in the rooms next door.  \n\nOne of my sisters and her kids moved in with me and my wife a few years ago temporarily (~9 months ish), and that didn't stop me from crushing in my own house either.  In that case, we certainly tried to be respectful to my sis, her kids, and mine, but its kinda  obvious (at least to sis) when we are like \"uuuhhh we are going to go take a nap, byyyyeeee\" \n\nIt's not that weird, people fuck.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. So he calls her \"baby\" and acts like they are out on a date when she comes out with you guys. He also isn't comfortable having sex with you if she is in the house... He wants to fuck his sister. You should RUN", "I'm sorry but their relationship sounds a little too incestuous to me. No brother calls his sister baby and insist on sitting by her instead of you.\nRUN!!!!!!\nYou deserve so much better than him.", "NTA No way Jose. That room he wants to give her is already in use. I\u2019d be hard no but even more with it being my living and working space", "You will be an AH if you stay with this man long-term.  He's putting his family before you.  \n\n+ I don't have a problem sending what he can afford to his family.  \n\nI have a problem when he wants to reorganize your life to please him.\n\nNTA.  This is a huge red flag.", "Does the apartment not have doors on the rooms?", "not only your sex life but all types of privacy, it will put a lot of strain on your relationship, been through it before and was glad to have my house back after my sister left", "NTA, DO NOT let another woman into the dynamic of your home.", "NTA. It's more than reasonable to not want to finish raising your SIL when her own parents would be perfectly capable if they had their priorities in order. That he is even suggesting it is a yellow flag in my eyes. I would make sure you're able to support yourself in case you need to. Following through with this when you are against it shows lack of readiness to be in a partnership and you should react accordingly.", "Lets put it this way... he wants to force you to go from partners to roommates. He clearly favours his sister over you and I can tell you this will be happening due to that alone. You will have NO choice!\nAlso NEVER have your office in the room you sleep... it's stressful and you never switch off. \nYou will also take a financial hit and be running around cooking and cleaning for her but won't be able to complain. You'll also not only no longer have sex but no affection as it will all go to the sister... he does it now when she's with you.\nSorry but this is the end of the road. Start making exit plans now. He's shown his true face. Stop thinking you can fix this. You can't.", "Stick to no and also wtf. Moving an underage person into your house when his dad makes $100K/year because mom doesn't want to work and dad doesn't want to stop spending is NOT the way to go. You also can't tell your partner hey, we're not going to have sex for months haha and expect them to stay without illness or disability. \n\nYou need to assume this relationship will end soon. NTA.", "All of those are very valid concerns. NTA. You definitely need to speak to him about it.\n\nI think it would be fair to change the utility and grocery split to you paying 1/3. There needs to be a balance of household chores and cooking. 16 is old enough to cool and 32 certainly is as well. Cooking for 3 is a lot more work than for two. I think if you dialed back cooking to maybe 50% that would be fair. \n\nThe no sex for months thing would be a deal breaker for me. But is he willing to compromise by having little sister stay with his parents for a night a week or something like that? \n\nNot wanting to feel like a 3rd wheel is definitely understandable. If he only sits by her once in a while during events that isn\u2019t a big deal, but if he will make it a habit while you live together, that would be messed up. If he withdraws his affection because his sister is around, that will definitely put a strain on your relationship. \n\nYou have to set firm boundaries and stick to them.", "He\u2019s not worried about \u201cnot\u201d having sex because in actuality- \u201cbaby\u201d will be around. He\u2019s covered.", "NTA. As someone who now lives with her brother-in-law, avoid this at all costs. We have no choice with my situation, but you do. It's not just about the lack of intimacy. It affects every aspect of your life.", "NTA! Do not let her move in. It sounds like it would have a huge impact on your quality of life. Even if she doesn't move in, his whole vibe when he's with her sounds really off-putting. Don't put up with it if you don't like it.", "NTA\n\nNo sex is a deal breaker for a person who has a high libido. If you're one of them, it's something that's involuntary. You'll be miserable if you cave in now, I know you care for him, but you're important also. I let my mother-in-law move in, it impacted me in the same way, I'm bitter.", "NTA. All of your reasons seem like good ones to me.", "This is wild. NtA\nI'd be telling my sister,  yo you can move in but you need to be out of the house for 2-3 hours at least 1-2 times per week so me and partner can have alone time", "NTA.  It will negatively effect YOU in many ways and he doesn't care.  I would move out before I would let her move in.", "His relationship with his sister sounds quite unhealthy if he blows you off whenever she is around and if he is happy to abstain from intimacy for months. \n\nNTA", "NTA. The proposal to change your home life that drastically is a big imposition.", "NTA. If you don't leave him soon, you'll only be hurting yourself. Seeing your other posts it is quite clear that you are not a priority and he has little respect for you.", "You need to ask him more questions and set some boundaries.\n\n1. where will you work from home and have a quiet space for that?\n2. who will be responsible for cleaning and cooking? shared 3 ways?\n3. who will be responsible for food costs? shared 3 ways?\n4. is there a time limit on her stay?\n5. Does she drive? have her own car? driving duties?\n6. boundary 1: no sex for months is a deal breaker for you\n7. boundary 2: whatever you need to say about cleaning, bills, expenses, etc\n\nEDIT: NTA", "NTA but that relationship seems very strange. Why is he calling her baby and treating her like a SO not a sibling.", "Yikes!  Are you sure that's not a one bedroom with a big closet?", "Nta\n\nIf he forces you to move her in, this relationship is over. You want him to be happy but it doesn't feel like he cares about your happiness", "NTA  If you can afford it tell him he needs to move back home instead of moving the family in.

That's the way it will always be.", "NTA and this is not a reasonable request for him to make. This isn't a short term situation--his parents' finances sound really problematic and I don't see them solving them anytime soon. The fact that he won't have sex while she's there is also a huge red flag. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like he'd be reasonable about you saying no, so I'm afraid your relationship is over.", "NTA. \n\nYou will NOT be happy with her living there, and from some of your comments I can see this isn't an emergency at all, her parents are perfectly capable of providing for her.\n\nStand your ground.", "NTA", "NTA, and from what you are saying, are you sure this is the right relationship for you?  I mean, really read what you posted, and ask yourself, if a friend came to you for advice with this relationship, would you advise her to stay?   \n    \nEither way, you should never be made to feel like a third wheel in your own home.  No is the correct answer.", "6. You might miss your office", "NTA\u2026 I would tell him it\u2019s a deal breaker due to the stated boundaries if she moves in. You will move out if she does.\n\nEdit for a damn autocorrect error", "NTA. His sister isn\u2019t his responsibility. \nAlthough he cares for her, which is wonderful, it\u2019s his sister, not his child. He holds no financial responsibility for her, and it should remain that way. \n\nHave you talked with him about these specific reasons? If not, you need to. How he responds will be a big deciding factor. \n\nIt\u2019s also concerning that he\u2019s expecting to be able to FULL-TIME care for another person, on top of already being with you, when he can\u2019t even pay for all three of you when you *occasionally* go out? Mm.. that\u2019s fishy and seems he might not be great with money either. Which to me is a big red flag. You don\u2019t want to end up in the same scenario as his parents\u2026", "NTA.  ALL of your reasons are valid.  It's his parents' responsibility to raise and support their daughter; your BF is already subsidizing any expenses related to supporting her.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not that fussed about the no sex or the \u201cbaby\u201d nickname, myself. Some people have low sex drives or just aren\u2019t that bothered about sex (I know because I\u2019m one of them - I can happily go for ages without, and your bf may just be the same), and some people have nicknames for their siblings. And considering their age difference, a nickname like \u201cbaby\u201d makes sense. Old habits die hard and all that.\n\nHowever, I do take issue with all the ways he indicates that his priorities lie with his parents and sister rather than you. You are partners. You absolutely should not be made to feel like you\u2019re second fiddle in his eyes. I happen to be very close to my family. I love them very much. But my partner - my chosen family - is my priority. You deserve to be somebody\u2019s priority.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say you should leave your partner. I know things aren\u2019t always that simple. But I think you need to have a talk with him.", "Nta this would be a huge mistake and your relationship will not survive.", "NTA... it would be better for him to help them financially.  He can also help them find other ways to save money", "The girl is 16 not the baby sister he thinks she is. I'd like to see his reaction when he comes home and finds her having sex.", "NTA!\n\nYou are correctly thinking that housing your BF younger sister is a mistake. Everything you shared ( parents make a good living but overspend and are in debt to the point where they need help from another of their children to provide for a minor child, live in partner puts younger sister above his partner etc\u2026) is a big red flag!\n\nQuit this relationship ASAP. Boyfriend will never put your needs as a couple above his parents and sister, he has detachment issues! You will suffer if you ever marry and have children with him! You and your relationship will suffer if his sister moves in. \n\nYou are better off ending the relationship now!", "You forgot\n6) you WFH and she would be staying in your office.\n\nNTA", "Are you sure it's his sister?", "There is no way this is real, he calls his 16-year-old sister baby?? Please tell me this is a \"haha you're such a baby\" and not a \"baby, can you pass the sugar?\"...very very NTA, and I would be creeped out enough to run the other way at the speed of light if my girlfriend called her brother that. It reminds me of that one episode in Friends where Rachel starts dating that dude from her building. I was the youngest of my siblings so idk maybe I just don't understand their bond or something because nobody else who is replying seems to be bringing this up, but my siblings and I are very close and yet this seems so, so, so creepy to me. \n\nAlso, if for some reason that isn't a deal breaker for you, I do feel like you should consider the future issues regarding your different sex drives. If you have a high libido, and he is content with being abstinent for months, this will quite likely cause some problems in a long-term relationship. You haven't even been dating for a year and he is already showing disinterest in the physical side of your relationship...what will happen when you two are out of the honeymoon phase after a year or two?", "6 months? You got no leverage. He will be fine if you leave. She won't be in the house 24 hrs a day plus sex outside the house is fun. He dont like you that much if he is fine without having sex.", "There is no way in hell this is going to be a long term relationship. I\u2019m not sure you have a relationship as much as you have a roommate. I have never met a man that doesn\u2019t want sex as often as they can get it. Are you sure he\u2019s not gay? Hell no to the sister moving in and he can take his real family and shove it up his ass. Move on and find someone who wants an adult relationship. NTA", "It sounds like he has a crush on his sis, favoring her over op", "INCESTTTTTTTTTT. NTA.", "NAH. It's your place too and you have a say in who stays there. If he wants to help his parents support his sister, he can do so financially. That guest bedroom is your office, it's where you earn your living. I don't see this going well. His sister is a teenager and they are quite a handful. Plus, you resent the attention he shows her already and she's not living there with you yet.

If he does it anyway, then you know where you stand in that relationship.", "So I wouldn't call you an asshole or not because this will greatly depend on the two of you and his sister\n\nFirst of all, the baby thing is weird but other than that, they might just be very close and I'm not going to speculate further and other people shouldn't just randomly assume stuff.\n\n1. I agree that a lack of a sex life could be a massive factor.  Sex is valued differently by different people and for someone who values it highly, going without it for months would be awful.  Other than times one of us are out of town, my girlfriend and I have never gone a day without sex.\n2. Could you ask that your boyfriend contribute more to cooking?  or if his sister is staying with you, could she help?  I know most 16 year olds can't cook but some could be better than a lot of adults.\n3. Could she also not help with cleaning?  kids are usually given chores.  Things like dishes, vacuuming, and cleaning the bathroom aren't just helping out but teaching responsibility.\n4. You are fine with him helping his family financially, so I would assume that if she moved in, this is something he would also contribute to enough so that it doesn't impact your finances.  If it isn't, I don't see how him helping his family financially was going to work in the first place.\n5. This is what I was talking about earlier so i'm not going to speculate on their relationship, but if he wants her to move in to help his family, you could bring this issue up with him so he can make an effort to help you not feel like a third wheel.", "1.) that\u2019s creepy he calls his sister baby.\n2.) set up ground rules of if she moves in you a: bills will be split in thirds, she will be responsible for her own groceries essentials etc if she starts taking  yours you expect to either be reimbursed or have that replaced within a week. If she doesn\u2019t you will take it out of your portion of rent and it will be on them to figure it out. B.) if she starts or gets involves in drama or fights between you two she\u2019s out, if he argues on her side they both can leave. C.) if your sex life is affected and your bf refuses to if she\u2019s there he either needs to tell her to leave for a few hours, take you guys to a hotel on his expense, or give you a pass to have sex with someone else. D.) if you aren\u2019t having sex in your apartment neither is she. E.) if you feel uncomfortable at anytime she needs to leave and you two need to have a discussion if that discussion can\u2019t be had without arguing it need to go to couples therapy or he can leave.

Or when you're sure she's asleep. Anything.

Does that mean residing? Or physically at your home?  She is most likely not going to be stuck in the house without leaving for months at a time, unless she had some sort of disability. You could work around her school schedule/weekends to create a time for you to be intimate with your bf lol.... I doubt he would be ok with not having sex either for months either. \n\nIf the relationship meant anything to you, you would find a way to make it work.\n\nShe has to help with cleaning/cooking 100% though.

I know you love to do this for your guy, but be generous. Perhaps the two of you can come up with a chore schedule. It\u2019s also a good opportunity to know one another, and bond. She will be his baby sister for the rest of her life.\n\n3) Getting your panties in a wad over his calling her \u201c\u201dbaby sister\u201d is petulant and controlling. She was in his life long before you were. It\u2019s a family thing. Let it go.\n\n4) Come up with a date night. At home. Sister can go out to dinner/movie with friends, and you two can go to town, whipped cream included. Just try to not leave an extra mess for Sis to clean up.\n\nThis is amazing and generous __of both of you__ to help her. Can you imagine how terrifying it must be, with her parents in such straits, and having to leave her home? She must be emotionally exhausted.\n\nTry a little tenderness.\n\nEDIT: After one comment, read OPs other posts.

One bedroom is ours and the other is a multipurpose storage room/guest bedroom and my office since I work from home. \n\nWe recently found out his parents are in debt that will take years to recover from. I don\u2019t mind my partner helping his family financially or getting things they need as long as my life with him isn\u2019t greatly impacted (like him helping pay our bills, food, etc). He recently brought up allowing his little sister, 16, to move into the room that is my office to help his parents not have to support her but I am against it for several reasons:\n\n1) THIS IS MY BIGGEST REASON AGAINST IT: Our sex life and intimacy will be greatly affected. He said he won\u2019t be comfortable doing it if she is here and he would be fine not having sex for MONTHS if it means his sister can move in. I have a way higher labido and would not be able to handle this level of abstinence and I know I would grow resentful of the situation.\n\n2) I do a majority of the cooking (probably 95% of it) and I currently pay for most of the groceries as he pays for our date nights. \n\n3) I tend to do more cleaning as I work from home, I don\u2019t mind cause I love taking care of my partner and he is cleanly so it isn\u2019t too much trouble.\n\n4) We split bills according to our wages, I make a little less then him so I pay about 45% of the rent and utilities and we live in a HIGH cost state. \n\n5) I tend to feel like a third wheel when we are out with his sister, he even calls her \u201cbaby\u201d which I think is weird. He once asked me to pay for my own bill once when us three went out to eat together cause \u201che has to pay for his and her food already.\u201d He also sits by her instead of me at restaurants, family events, or when we are out. \n\nI know if she moves in, I will most likely be the third wheel in our own home and I don\u2019t want to live like this. But I am worried I may be acting selfish and I want my partner to be happy. So AITA for not wanting my boyfriend\u2019s sister to move in?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then that needs to be a conversation for the mom dad and sister not your team taking an additional person. Secondly his sister has a living mother and father. They should be responsible for her because shes not your problem. Imagine if this was while you had a kid. Would he still take his sister? What would he do with the kid where would he move it would he leave you with the kid while he florlurishes his sister? These are the questions that should be asked. And finally his relationship and thought process of sister > gf/wife is creepy and weird that he seems to think that his family is above using him as a convient tool for money and services.

Her costs would only be a very small amount of what his parents will pay anyway.  What exactly will your boyfriend be paying for his sister?  Because in reality what is his sister costing his parents.. some food and a small increase in utility bills but if she moves out.. unless she is running the heating or cooling at full bore 24/7 then they might have a point.  The sisters clothes are her parents responsibility and so is her schooling.

She may be more helpful than you think.  Despite being 16, she may be quite mature and help with cleaning (even if it's mainly cleaning up after herself) and she may help you cook.  It's not that much extra in food costs if you all eat the same things.  Going out is a different story.  If she's a PITA, then you will be moving out ASAP and her brother you will probably find will try and manipulate you into staying.\n\nDoes the sister have a part time job?  If not, this is something that can be encouraged so she can get her own incidentals of her own choosing ie toiletries, clothing (specific stuff she really wants) and stationery.\n\nThe withholding sex is the comment that really gets me.\n\nYour boyfriend is 32 and actually old enough to have a daughter his sisters age (if he started really young) so it's like he's wanting to be more her father figure.\n\nI'm really not sure this is the guy for you but only you can make that decision so have a good look at how you are being treated.

Bit of an odd thing to say if you\u2019re a 32 year old without those issues.", "Thats what her comment pointed out -.- even as his wife he will still choose the sister first.", "So tell him.\n\n\"I'm not having another roommate.  I do way more of the chores; I cook the food.  Also, I don't want to.  If your sister moves in, I'm moving out.\"\n\nAlso, btw, tell him to stop paying for the parents.  They're eventually going to retire, or at least want to.  If they won't adjust their lifestyle to suit their earnings on $100k, wait until they're just getting social security.  He'll have you eating rice and beans so he can afford their grocery bill.\n\ntbh, he doesn't sound like relationship material, but that's for you to decide.", "I think you need to have a really good conversation with him on both of your expectations and concerns and boundaries. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t on the same page, and that\u2019s ok, then maybe your time together is done (for now). \n\nNAH.", "NTA. And your BF should think about his hang-ups about sex before he has kids, because since obviously we all aren\u2019t only children, people definitely have sex when others are in the house.  Will he also have this attitude if/when he has a child? And if not, what about his relationship with his sister makes this situation different? Plus he\u2019s not respecting your home office.", "You must must must sit down and communicate your concerns as soon as possible. Let him know you consider this a deal-breaker. Soak up everything the other redditors have voiced to you, including the long term aspects and ramifications it will have on your life together", "Nta. Maybe he wants the apt and wants u to leave run", "Honestly, he needs to make a choice. Either stop supporting them entirely and you have your own life or you can move out and she can move in. I am skeptical that he will make the right choice but I would offer to see a counselor together if he mostly gets it. If not, cut your losses because otherwise you\u2019ll be looking for a new partner when you are in your mid-30s", "I see... in that case, he is not being a real family man & is neglecting his primary duty, which should always be to his wife first & foremost", "More than moving out, moving on..."]}
