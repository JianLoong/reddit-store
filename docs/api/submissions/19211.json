Depending where you are, you should consider urgent care medical attention or see your doctor when you get home. Especially if, as you say, you\u2019re having trouble standing up. Truly, that is not a normal reaction to a day of walking.", "NTA for not wanting to join in on the hiking activities but also shouldn\u2019t expect everyone else to not do the planned activities because you can\u2019t go. Let them go and you do something else you want to do by yourself.", "You need to tend to your burns. That's a priority. Let your parents (who don't seem to realise how serious this appears to be) do activities without you while you head to a pharmacy or get some first aid from hotel staff (if that's a service they can offer). NTA.", "NTA. Your parents are being very unreasonable to your injuries. They might feel disappointed changing plans, but theirs are clearly hurting you. Perhaps hang back and stay at the hotel pool while they go off on their planned thing?", "Your wounds are VISIBLE.  Getting a sunburn sucks, but you have a very severe sunburn if it blistering.\n\nYou are in pain and not being selfish.\n\nI am astounded that parents who can see the visible effects of serious sunburn, and tell their child they are being selfish.\n\nNTA\n\nIs there a pharmacy  or drugstore near where you are?  There is something I call Blue Aloe.  It sold be several brands,  It is aloe with lidocaine in it.  Green aloe doesn't have lidocaine.  Lidocaine a topical anesthetic, and will help with he pain.  Tylenol can also help.\n\nYOU should not be in the sun until you heal, and when you do go into the sun, use your sunscreen liberally, particularly on the areas that were severely burnt.\n\nStart using a zinc based sunscreen.  Put it on thickly and yes it looks weird, but it is the most effective sunscreen out there.", "NTA you are a adult and as much as you want to participate in the holiday, you\u2019re injured and allowed to make the call to just no do the thing that\u2019s going to make it worse-if they want to go walking, go without you.", "NAH, let them go off hiking for a day or so while you heal up. Also, as others have said, that much swelling from sunburn isn't normal. I'm surprised you've not had it checked out, or that your parents haven't made you have it checked out.", "Have you tried tylenol? You need to care for your sunburn. You can also ask the concierge for a local clinic and a doctor may be willing to give you a stronger pain killer. You don't need morphine, but something stronger than over the counter meds could get you back on track. Also, what's wrong with you staying home one day and enjoying the hotel while they go out. I'm sorry you got such a bad sunburn. I know it sucks. But you need to stay in and help it heal for at least one day. Tell them to go ahead and go to the doctor by yourself (concierge can tell you who and even get one to come to your room if you prefer) while they go on. Then you can continue on with them. It will also allow you time to buy a lightweight long sleeve top and a wide brimmed hat eith UV protection so you don't continue to make yourself worse while joining them the days after.", "NTA\n\nThey are being very inconsiderate. Why don't they just go and leave you at the hotel?", "NTA - You are in physical distress like what do they want you to do? Power through the pain for the sake of a walk? Get some rest and some after-sun care.\n\nThis story hits home so much for me.\n\nMy sister got badly sun burnt while on holiday with my family.\n\nI didn't really understand why she didn't want to do anything and my parents were annoyed she stayed at where we were staying rather than come out with us.\n\nFast forward a couple of years and I got bad sun burn on my feet and thighs. I now understand....", "ESH sorry but you say you are super white and haven't been in the sun for a year and got a crazy sunburn ... Meaning you didn't put enough sunscreen, put on clothes, went into the shade etc but then you continue to be at the pool? With i guess again not sunscreen etc. And you guys have been by the pool for a few days and now your parents want to do activities. I think that's okay. I only don't think it's okay what they said but I do get that they don't just want to stay at the hotel. And you are 18 ...\n\nAnd your title is wrong you don't talk about going slow you talk about them not being able to do the activities they wanted to do. I would also want to do the things I planned and essential paid for. \n\nWhy don't you just stay at the hotel and they go?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
