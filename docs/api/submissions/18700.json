Like you said, he's too young to be on social media (and it would make zero sense for a mother to be so protective of her son's exposure on those platforms, to let him be on them when he's not of age). So she is either hiding her own feelings behind her son's name... or she showed him the photos to make him upset so she would have a reason to whine. Both are incredibly immature and assholey actions. \n\nI also have to assume this isn't the first time you've shared photos of your son, your husband, or any combination of you together that makes it clear you are a family. Sure, without context it could look like you're excluding your husband's oldest son. But she knows that's not the case. Plus, you did include the child in the photoshoot and have plenty of photos of the entire family. \n\nHer argument holds no weight. Hence why she remains silent, she probably counted on you reacting as emotionally as her, and your very rational response left her unarmed.

Now she is upset she didn't have pictures taken. You didn't do anything wrong.", "Definitely NTA. She can\u2019t have it both ways!

This is something that can be calmly and rationally discussed amongst the adults. If your step-son is upset, reassure him he is part of the family and explain at a very high level why you didn't post it (in kids terms of course and do not 'bash' his mother for this decision).", " ESH but you unintentionally.

You are looking at this as though this is a conflict between yourself and your stepson's mom, but the real issue here is you hurt your stepson's feelings which you don't seem to even consider.  You posted a family photo on social media that excluded your stepson.  You are sending the message out into the world that he is not part of your family, obviously he's going to be upset.  Plus, why would you want to broadcast that message to everyone you know?  There is nothing compelling you to post photos on social media, if you can't post photos that include your stepson, don't post full-family photos at all.  There are plenty of other ways to share photos with people, not everything needs to be on Facebook.", "NTA but have you told your stepson the reason you aren\u2019t posting pictures with him in them? Because I guarantee you he will see them somehow if your profile isn\u2019t 100% private.", "NAH. I don\u2019t you meant to exclude your stepson by posting this picture but I can kind of see your stepson\u2019s mom\u2019s point. You\u2019ve been in your stepson\u2019s life since he was 2 and he spends half of his time with you. Maybe in terms of biology and legality, you only have one child but practically and emotionally, you have two. Having a picture of you and your husband with just your son as your profile picture sends a message that in your mind you\u2019re a family of three, not four. It would be one thing if you posted this picture to wish your son a happy birthday or something. Also, if you didn\u2019t take a picture with just you, your husband and stepson or just your husband and stepson, that looks bad too. Why is your son the only one who got a solo picture with their parents?", "???? You made it look to everyone online that you were excluding your stepson on purpose. Yes, you were honoring the mother's wishes, but that's not what it looks like to everyone else. YTA for the optics.", "This sounds like malicious compliance (which usually I\u2019m a fan of, but not at the expense of a kid\u2019s feelings). \n\nI can guarantee that people that saw that profile pic are talking and asking where the stepson is and if you\u2019re trying to erase him with your new kid (even if no photos of stepson is what the mom asked for and they aren\u2019t aware of that). \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s *right* \u2014 it sucks, but people do talk.

But, there was a better way to handle this right up front. \n\nSince you post, and apparently plan to continue posting pictures of your family on social media, you and your husband should have talked with the 11 year old up front about his mom\u2019s request.

And then take the kid for a ice cream or something nice. \n\nYou\u2019re respecting his mom\u2019s request.

They may have brought it up to her and been upset about it, saying you were excluding her son. In a moment like that, she may have forgotten the arrangement, and seeing someone make a big deal may have upset her.

Step mom also now knows that posting family photos without step son hurts his feelings (which she should have known without being told, but whatever).

That's a significant event and it was dense, at best, to do what OP did without even a text.", "I mean, why not just tell the kid the only reason he\u2019s not in the photo is because his mother said no?", "Nothing, I think it\u2019s a great idea.

It's absolutely reasonable not to post photos of the stepson per his mother's feelings; it's reasonable that he might be hurt by this; the object of that hurt should be his own mom, and I agree with the comments suggesting OP explain she only did it to respect his mother's safety concerns. \n\nIt's not reasonable that OP has to hide her whole family and her new child, too, if that isn't her wish. She obviously doesn't mind putting photos of her children online; why does she have to give it up because someone else is uncomfortable with it? Stepson's mom is only the co-parent of him; OP's child is her & her partner's child and they can post photos with their child if they wish. Otherwise, stepson's mom is making unilateral decisions for two families -- that her photo rule applies to everyone. This isn't reasonable or fair.", "Reread the post\u2026 you\u2019re confused.

Bio mom changed the rules.", "My question is why was OP\u2019s son the only child to have a solo photograph with the parents. I\u2019m not accusing OP of anything but appearances matter. If OP\u2019s son was photographed with just the parents then the stepson should have been as well. At the very least they should have gotten a father/son shot. If we were talking about kids who had the same parents on both sides that\u2019s what would have happened. Maybe if the stepson also had solo shots like his sibling, the mom wouldn\u2019t think much of the profile picture. These three adults have been able to coparent amicably without an issue for several years now so if the bio mom is speaking up about this, she must be genuinely upset.", "Yes, and no one seems to have any nuance for situations like this. Yes, she was honoring mom's rules, but really, you never thought about how this looked.

I get that OP wasn't thinking, but when we don't think, sometimes we hurt feelings. Just fix it.", "Sure that would have been helpful, but the incident is over and no one thought to do that.  \n\nBut again, it should boil down to what is best for the child.  \n\nWhatever joy is brought by OP over having her profile picture be a family picture that excludes the stepson does not outweigh the hurt feelings of the 11 year old.", "She wouldn't be hiding her family, she would just be not sharing her family photos on Facebook.  I don't understand why people think this is such a big imposition.  Also, I'm not saying that she should refrain from posting the photos because bio mom wants it, I'm saying she should do it because of the kid's feelings which, in this situation, should be the primary thing to consider.", "Bio Mom was upset that her kid was upset that step mom posted family photos without him in them.  There is a probability that bio mom showed the kid the photos to stir the pot, which if true bio mom is an AH.  But I'm focusing on the kid's feelings here, which everyone else, including OP, seems to be ignoring. Its not realistic to think that an 11 year old will never see facebook; he will probably find out what his step mom is posting regardless of whether bio mom shows him, or he gets access through cousin or friend or something. If step mom is posting happy family photos (or especially making one her profile pic) that don't include stepson, stepson is going to find out and probably have his feelings hurt.  That's just common sense.  Outside of the specific prohibition on posting step son's photos on the internet, bio-mom's feelings on what step-mom should or should not post are irrelevant.  The step-mom should consider the kid's feelings, which she is not.", "So she had a photo to post online is why ops son was in a solo photography with the parents", "Or just tell the kid that it\u2019s because his mom doesn\u2019t want the pics posted?", "So they are suppose to not post any photos because of the request of the mom. It doesn\u2019t effect their own. If I spent money I\u2019d post too. She did it either A- to make her look bad B- sincerely forgot and owes apology c- will destroy the relationship", "That's not what I'm saying.\n\nI'm saying OP had ample time to talk to bio mom about wanting to post these. OP isn't an asshole, but professionally done photos are VERY different than a random day at the park or hanging out in the house.", "But again, what are you saying? She did talk to bio mom; mom said no photos of my son online, and OP respected that. So the only possibility left is not to post photos at all, which is unreasonable. Of course she wanted to share the beautiful, professional photos she had taken.\n\nStepson's mom cannot make unilateral decisions for OP that mean OP can never post family photos with her child. That isn't fair. Stepson's mom gets to make that choice for her child; she can't make that choice for everyone. This is just a consequence of it. If her son is hurt by it, it should be on his mom to re-evaluate, or have a backbone and explain to him, \"This was respecting my rule. Your father & I don't share photos of you online because I don't think it's safe, and your stepmom respected that. She printed family photos with you and loves you very much.\" \n\nThat's her role as a parent -- to stand by the rule *she* made and explain it, not to throw the blame on someone else. OR don't let him see! That's on her, also. \n\nShe doesn't have the authority to dictate what OP does with OP's child so that it makes stepson's mother's life easier.", "You are missing the point and you have absolutely no nuance to the situation. It's not all or nothing. The no social media picture rule happened early. It's very understandable. Understanding there's a difference between random photos at the house or the beach or the park is also different than something like a professionally taken picture, or picture for a holiday card.\n\nSure bio mom could've been more specific, but a professional family photo is definitely not a regular occurrence. OP even delivered photos WITH step son in them to bio mom.\n\nOptically, it looks very bad. Stepson basically being excluded from an event he was at. It takes 2 seconds to mention wanting to post the professionally taken photos. The bio mom can say yes that's okay or no that's not okay. 30 second conversation and it's all good. OP can proceed to post the same picture or the pictures with everyone in them. The point is that it's a really bad look to do what OP did."]}
