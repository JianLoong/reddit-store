One of her wishes was that she no longer wanted my husband or I to post pictures of stepson online.

However, I got a few photos of just myself, my hubby, and baby so I could get a new profile picture for social media.  \nAnyway, we get the finished (edited) photos a few weeks later and I print a bunch! I give family photos to everyone including MIL+FIL, aunts/uncles, and my stepson's mother. She loved the photos and even hung one in her house.

Like you said, he's too young to be on social media (and it would make zero sense for a mother to be so protective of her son's exposure on those platforms, to let him be on them when he's not of age). So she is either hiding her own feelings behind her son's name... or she showed him the photos to make him upset so she would have a reason to whine. Both are incredibly immature and assholey actions. \n\nI also have to assume this isn't the first time you've shared photos of your son, your husband, or any combination of you together that makes it clear you are a family. Sure, without context it could look like you're excluding your husband's oldest son. But she knows that's not the case. Plus, you did include the child in the photoshoot and have plenty of photos of the entire family. \n\nHer argument holds no weight.

Now she is upset she didn't have pictures taken. You didn't do anything wrong.", "Definitely NTA. She can\u2019t have it both ways!

This is something that can be calmly and rationally discussed amongst the adults. If your step-son is upset, reassure him he is part of the family and explain at a very high level why you didn't post it (in kids terms of course and do not 'bash' his mother for this decision).", " ESH but you unintentionally.

You are looking at this as though this is a conflict between yourself and your stepson's mom, but the real issue here is you hurt your stepson's feelings which you don't seem to even consider.  You posted a family photo on social media that excluded your stepson.  You are sending the message out into the world that he is not part of your family, obviously he's going to be upset.  Plus, why would you want to broadcast that message to everyone you know?  There is nothing compelling you to post photos on social media, if you can't post photos that include your stepson, don't post full-family photos at all.  There are plenty of other ways to share photos with people, not everything needs to be on Facebook.", "NTA but have you told your stepson the reason you aren\u2019t posting pictures with him in them? Because I guarantee you he will see them somehow if your profile isn\u2019t 100% private.", "NAH. I don\u2019t you meant to exclude your stepson by posting this picture but I can kind of see your stepson\u2019s mom\u2019s point. You\u2019ve been in your stepson\u2019s life since he was 2 and he spends half of his time with you. Maybe in terms of biology and legality, you only have one child but practically and emotionally, you have two. Having a picture of you and your husband with just your son as your profile picture sends a message that in your mind you\u2019re a family of three, not four. It would be one thing if you posted this picture to wish your son a happy birthday or something. Also, if you didn\u2019t take a picture with just you, your husband and stepson or just your husband and stepson, that looks bad too. Why is your son the only one who got a solo picture with their parents?", "???? You made it look to everyone online that you were excluding your stepson on purpose. Yes, you were honoring the mother's wishes, but that's not what it looks like to everyone else. YTA for the optics.", "This sounds like malicious compliance (which usually I\u2019m a fan of, but not at the expense of a kid\u2019s feelings). \n\nI can guarantee that people that saw that profile pic are talking and asking where the stepson is and if you\u2019re trying to erase him with your new kid (even if no photos of stepson is what the mom asked for and they aren\u2019t aware of that). \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s *right* \u2014 it sucks, but people do talk.

And then take the kid for a ice cream or something nice. \n\nYou\u2019re respecting his mom\u2019s request.

They may have brought it up to her and been upset about it, saying you were excluding her son. In a moment like that, she may have forgotten the arrangement, and seeing someone make a big deal may have upset her.

Step mom also now knows that posting family photos without step son hurts his feelings (which she should have known without being told, but whatever).  So the reasonable thing for a parent to do is respect the reasonable boundary and also the kid's feelings and not post photos that upset the kid.  I agree that it's her page and her call, but that doesn't mean she's not an AH.\n\nEdit: also, she had the photos without stepson taken specifically for the purpose of making a new profile picture.

Her reply confirms that there will be a larger photo of everyone (*including* stepson) above the mantle as the main family photo. The only reason there's a photo without him is explicitly stated -- so she can post one online without him, per his mother's wishes, because he is not to be in online versions. How does that make it sound like including him was a courtesy? That would be more like OP staged multiple photos without him, and added him to one last minute. He was involved every step of the way -- until the step his mother said \"no\" to, posting him online.", "That's not what I'm saying at all. \n\nProfessionally done family photos are a significant event.

It'd be one thing if they were just beach day or at the park or something, but those are professionally done photos. That doesn't happen often. That's a significant event and it was dense, at best, to do what OP did without even a text.", "I mean, why not just tell the kid the only reason he\u2019s not in the photo is because his mother said no?", "Nothing, I think it\u2019s a great idea.

That would have been the 'reasonable thing to do'.", "The kid isn\u2019t on Facebook. If he\u2019s hurt by this, his bio mother manufactured the situation by logging into her Facebook account and showing him deliberately, without telling him that it was due to her request. Seems like straight up sociopathic behavior. You support this?", "How is that reasonable? It's absolutely reasonable not to post photos of the stepson per his mother's feelings; it's reasonable that he might be hurt by this; the object of that hurt should be his own mom, and I agree with the comments suggesting OP explain she only did it to respect his mother's safety concerns. \n\nIt's not reasonable that OP has to hide her whole family and her new child, too, if that isn't her wish. She obviously doesn't mind putting photos of her children online; why does she have to give it up because someone else is uncomfortable with it? Stepson's mom is only the co-parent of him; OP's child is her & her partner's child and they can post photos with their child if they wish. Otherwise, stepson's mom is making unilateral decisions for two families -- that her photo rule applies to everyone. This isn't reasonable or fair.", "Reread the post\u2026 you\u2019re confused. The bio mom was upset because the kid wasn\u2019t included in the family pic. Bio mom changed the rules.", "My question is why was OP\u2019s son the only child to have a solo photograph with the parents. I\u2019m not accusing OP of anything but appearances matter. If OP\u2019s son was photographed with just the parents then the stepson should have been as well. At the very least they should have gotten a father/son shot. If we were talking about kids who had the same parents on both sides that\u2019s what would have happened. Maybe if the stepson also had solo shots like his sibling, the mom wouldn\u2019t think much of the profile picture. These three adults have been able to coparent amicably without an issue for several years now so if the bio mom is speaking up about this, she must be genuinely upset.", "Yes, and no one seems to have any nuance for situations like this. Yes, she was honoring mom's rules, but really, you never thought about how this looked. Didn't even post a caption that says, \"Loved stepson not included, due to request for no social media from family.\" This could have been prevented. I get that OP wasn't thinking, but when we don't think, sometimes we hurt feelings. Just fix it.", "Sure that would have been helpful, but the incident is over and no one thought to do that.  \n\nBut again, it should boil down to what is best for the child.  \n\nWhatever joy is brought by OP over having her profile picture be a family picture that excludes the stepson does not outweigh the hurt feelings of the 11 year old.", "She wouldn't be hiding her family, she would just be not sharing her family photos on Facebook.  I don't understand why people think this is such a big imposition.  Also, I'm not saying that she should refrain from posting the photos because bio mom wants it, I'm saying she should do it because of the kid's feelings which, in this situation, should be the primary thing to consider.", "Bio Mom was upset that her kid was upset that step mom posted family photos without him in them.  There is a probability that bio mom showed the kid the photos to stir the pot, which if true bio mom is an AH.  But I'm focusing on the kid's feelings here, which everyone else, including OP, seems to be ignoring. Its not realistic to think that an 11 year old will never see facebook; he will probably find out what his step mom is posting regardless of whether bio mom shows him, or he gets access through cousin or friend or something. If step mom is posting happy family photos (or especially making one her profile pic) that don't include stepson, stepson is going to find out and probably have his feelings hurt.  That's just common sense.  Outside of the specific prohibition on posting step son's photos on the internet, bio-mom's feelings on what step-mom should or should not post are irrelevant.  The step-mom should consider the kid's feelings, which she is not.", "So she had a photo to post online is why ops son was in a solo photography with the parents", "Or just tell the kid that it\u2019s because his mom doesn\u2019t want the pics posted?", "So they are suppose to not post any photos because of the request of the mom. It doesn\u2019t effect their own. If I spent money I\u2019d post too. She did it either A- to make her look bad B- sincerely forgot and owes apology c- will destroy the relationship", "That's not what I'm saying.\n\nI'm saying OP had ample time to talk to bio mom about wanting to post these. OP isn't an asshole, but professionally done photos are VERY different than a random day at the park or hanging out in the house.", "But again, what are you saying? She did talk to bio mom; mom said no photos of my son online, and OP respected that. So the only possibility left is not to post photos at all, which is unreasonable. Of course she wanted to share the beautiful, professional photos she had taken.\n\nStepson's mom cannot make unilateral decisions for OP that mean OP can never post family photos with her child. That isn't fair. Stepson's mom gets to make that choice for her child; she can't make that choice for everyone. This is just a consequence of it. If her son is hurt by it, it should be on his mom to re-evaluate, or have a backbone and explain to him, \"This was respecting my rule. Your father & I don't share photos of you online because I don't think it's safe, and your stepmom respected that. She printed family photos with you and loves you very much.\" \n\nThat's her role as a parent -- to stand by the rule *she* made and explain it, not to throw the blame on someone else. OR don't let him see! That's on her, also. \n\nShe doesn't have the authority to dictate what OP does with OP's child so that it makes stepson's mother's life easier.", "You are missing the point and you have absolutely no nuance to the situation. It's not all or nothing. The no social media picture rule happened early. It's very understandable. Understanding there's a difference between random photos at the house or the beach or the park is also different than something like a professionally taken picture, or picture for a holiday card.\n\nSure bio mom could've been more specific, but a professional family photo is definitely not a regular occurrence. OP even delivered photos WITH step son in them to bio mom.\n\nOptically, it looks very bad. Stepson basically being excluded from an event he was at. It takes 2 seconds to mention wanting to post the professionally taken photos. The bio mom can say yes that's okay or no that's not okay. 30 second conversation and it's all good. OP can proceed to post the same picture or the pictures with everyone in them. The point is that it's a really bad look to do what OP did.", "NTA but for the sake of the kid, I do think it's worth recognizing you could have had the photo shoot with him included for print outs that the family received and then ones without him to post on social media.  \n\nYou did say there were several photos with different groups of people in each of them, having a few that included him and didn't end up online wouldn't have been an issue unless I'm missing some information.", "No, she can't have it both ways. NTA as long as your stepson is not hurt.", "Nta.", "I think there's a difference between \"candid pictures\" and \"family pictures\". You basically posted a bunch of pictures of your \"family\" excluding him, of course he felt bad. Maybe you should have kept them to yourself, not everything has to go on social media (and think of your bio kid's privacy too...). ESH, you should have thought about the stepkids feelings too, or at least explained to him beforehand what his mother said and checked with him.", "NTA - it isn't like you excluded him from the family pictures all together, you just did not post the ones he was in, as per her request.  I am sure that if she did not request that, the pictures with your stepson would have been included.", "NTA put it back up. You honored her wishes and when it was brought to her attention she had no comeback. To think that you won't post pictures of your and your husband and child I hope that's not what she is gonna try and say. Don't let her win put the pic back up.", "NTA she\u2019s a trouble maker. Let your husband handle it.", "NTA but I would have a large 18x24 family photo of everyone, beautifully framed, from the same photography session and ask stepson to help you pick out a place where you can proudly hang a photo of your family. Include him in the process and it may give you are more casual opening to discuss multiple parents, respecting others\u2019 wishes and ask him if there are any other things different between the two households that he would like to talk about.", "NTA", "She can\u2019t expect you to not post pictures of your own biological family. She requested her bio kid not be included online. You honored that.  Considering he was included in all other photos, the ones that will be hung up in the house and sent out to family members, proves it wasn\u2019t malicious. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting a picture that doesn\u2019t include him so that you can make your own decisions about whether or not you want your own child on your social media.", "You were respecting her wishes, and you reminded her you were when she got unreasonable made for whatever reason.    \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA..  she wanted it her way, but in turn she made her son feel excluded because of her rule.\n\nMaybe make your page private", "NTA. Everyone else has said everything else.\n\nI would hope though that you did get some pics of just you husband and stepson. The existence of the other in any capacity have the chance to make him feel jealous so hopefully you took them so if nothing else he can have the just me dad and stepmom photo for his room or something.", "I was ready to say Y T A until you said that the mother didn't want his picture posted on social media. NTA.", "NTA- I'd edit the photo captions to say stepson is in other photos that are on online due to mother's request.\n\nUnless she follows you or Facebook friends and she saw herself, I wonder if someone saw it and contacted her.", "NTA. She wanted to have her cake and eat it too. But in this case, she wanted a cake with no sugar since sugar is bad for you but now doesn\u2019t like the taste of a sugarless cake.\n\nETA: youve already done more than enough but I see some people post pics of their kid(s) on social media with their faces blurred. May be a solution?", "NTA\n\nMy guess is someone else saw them and said \"isn't Little Johnny part of the family, too? What an awful stepmom.\"\n\nMom wasn't thinking about your agreement, she had her buttons pushed by a meddler. I'd put money on it.", "NTA\n\nI really don't understand why she's upset... you did exactly what she asked you to do. Did her son find out somehow, and now she's trying to act like she had nothing to do with it?", "NTA. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.", "NTA.\n\nINFO: You said that the bio mom has been out for a few years. Are you able to say why? Depending on what it is, it may play a part in her reaction.", "NTA.  I have a sinking feeling that the stepson is the one who actually felt hurt here and bio Mom is throwing you under the bus.  If you can get her to respond, stepson is old enough for everyone to be mature about this and let him know why the pics of him were not posted online, and for the adults to work out a new agreement that won't cause more pain for the child.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s her silly rule that you follows and she can be the one to explain it to her son.", "NTA. Unfriend her and block her from social media. Problem solved.", "NTA  \n\n\nWow. This is all about expectations. If he had known what his Mom told you this would never have happened. This is Mom's fault. Period.", "Nta this comment", "Bot.

This is her feeling insecure about your family photos with her ex and her needing a way to lash out about it. She\u2019s using your stepson as the weapon but i believe there\u2019s more behind why she lashed out. NTA", "Does the son even know about it or did mom just rush to get defensive on his behalf?", "Aye, aye, captain.", "She said that the mom had already been sent copies of \u201cthe photos\u201d and even hung one in her house. She wasn\u2019t clear if it was a solo shot of stepson from the same shoot, or if bio mom has a family portrait of her kid with his brother and potentially dad and stepmom (which wouldn\u2019t be that weird if they\u2019re actually on good terms as OP said, the kid lives there half the time and those are his family members). \n\nI hope they said to the stepson at the photo shoot \u201cnow we\u2019re going to take a few photos with just the baby for social media. These are only to post online, because your mom prefers not to have your picture posted, ok?\u201d As long as they told the kid why he was left out this seems fine. \n\nOP you could also ask the bio mom if she prefers stepson to not be in photos at all, or just doesn\u2019t want his face online. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who blur the face or cover it with an emoji, or take photos with the kid facing away from the camera, etc. There may be a compromise if she doesn\u2019t want her kid totally excluded from family photos (on social media) but still wants his privacy respected.", "People should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they become part of Facebook's datamine.  Its not right for parents to make that decision for their kids before the kids are old enough to decide for themselves.", "I'm not saying she should refrain because the other woman doesn't like it, she should refrain because the kid doesn't like it.", "OP wants to share photos of her husband and babies. She shouldn\u2019t have to give that up because the mom has different rules for her son. The mom and son just have to live with the rules she created.", "ima say both at the same time", "they aren't fighting that battle. bio mom said please don't do X and they said ok. the problem is they followed that and she got upset.", "/u/Buncelpful is a bot that stole part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xi4v3/aita_for_not_posting_family_pictures_with_my/jmh77wx/", "I'm wondering if she set that boundary a show of dominance. I.E. \"I'm his \\*mother\\* and I don't want you, his \\*stepmother,\\* posting pictures of my boy\" expecting OP to start something and then promptly forgot about it after OP just agreed and respected the boundary.", "It might not be that complex, its likely the mom doesn't have any specific machinations on controlling op. She asked them not to post photos (which is a very common thing for parents to ask) went on with her life not thinking about it, saw the photo post had an over reaction to defend her kid and is now embarrassed because she forgot about the rule she gave them.\n\nThis could easily end with the mom going \"I'm sorry I saw the family post some stuff happened and I got defensive about my kid and I overreacted my bad ill be better\" there's no reason at this point to look at hill and go \"that must be a mountain better get the hiking gear\". Better to wait and see before making any assumptions especially because step parents and step kid relationships can be very delicate.", "100%. So glad I'm old enough that I remember the before FB days.", "Again, no one said she had to give it up. However, she also didn't have to use a professionally taken portrait excluding her stepson as her profile picture! People are really having trouble with nuance today.", "This is a very kind and measured take on the situation.

I signed up right away.  In hindsight I wish I had never.", "I don't know that bio mom showed the kid deliberately, but if she did she's an AH.  That doesn't change the fact that step mom did something inclusive of her new baby and exclusive of her step son, and then didn't even consider the step son's feelings after the fact.", "No, people are understanding fine. It\u2019s just that what you\u2019re saying is ridiculous.", "All nuance is lost on Reddit I guess.\n\nThere's no space to understand why bio mom was livid while also not calling step mom an asshole. Spending 10 seconds thinking about others is apparently too much", "How else would he have seen it? And why wouldn\u2019t bioMom just tell the kid the only reason he was not posted is because of her? She\u2019s happy to let her son be upset as long as she can pretend she had nothing to do with it. Anyway, hopefully now OP will let the kid know she wants to post him in pictures but his mother stopped it. He seems old enough to understand that and take it up with his mom.", "It\u2019s a big imposition because social media is how many people share things. \n\nEither the bio mom can change her boundary or she and her son can live with the results of that boundary.", "No, you're making up your own argument. You're saying OP should be allowed to post pictures of her husband and her baby. And she is! She even said she has shared candids of them before without incident. The issue here is that making her profile picture a family portrait that doesn't include the stepson was a hurtful choice. She didn't have to do that! Yes, she's allowed to. And yes, it's not her rule about the stepson's social media presence. But she could have made a more conscientious choice in this one particular instance. That's all.", "truly it is. I don't think OP is an ah exactly, but I do think she was thoughtless in her approach trying to do what mom said to do. 11 year old kids are very good at getting around the \"no sm\" rule, and even if he didn't it kind of looks bad to others as well. I really believe she didn't mean any harm, but unfortunately no matter what she meant, stepson still has hurt feelings and if she really cares about him, she'll want to him to understand that she wasn't trying to erase him.", "\"How else would he have seen it?\"\n\nCousin, other realtive, friend, I don't know.  You're probably right that bio mom showed him, I don't really care, I'm not focused on the bio mom or her actions here. It doesn't matter how the kid got access to it, its not reasonable to think that an 11 year old isn't going to get access to facebook somehow.\n\nMy mom doesn't use facebook (thank God), but if she did and I told her not to post photos of me on there, she would respect that.  She also wouldn't post photos of herself and the rest of the family excluding me, that would be weird. I mean, she wouldn't even have photos like that taken, why would she?  In this case, Step mom had a series of full family photos taken, and then another series of her, her husband and their new baby.  Even having those photos taken sucks for the step kid.  He has to sit there while his dad and step mom take photos with his replacement sibling and not him. Then she posted them publicly and even made one her damn profile picture.  That's AH behavior.", ">It\u2019s a big imposition because social media is how many people share things.\n\nIt doesn't have to be, there are plenty of private and secure services available for sharing photos with people. The difference with Facebook is that it allows the user to share with the public at large.  There is no need for step mom to do that with family photos, especially if it is causing family turmoil.\n\nAlso, step mom is going to have to live with the results of her own actions. Step child is upset, its easy to see why. If he feels displaced by his new step sibling and this facebook nonsense contributes to that, that is a consequence that step mom will have to deal with.  If she doesn't consider that, or doesn't care, she's kind of an AH.", "Wow you\u2019ve really opened my eyes, America has a real problem. I see hundreds people posting pictures without every single child or family member on a weekly basis. At the massive national scale we\u2019re talking about, it might require a public interest campaign or something. \n\nMy own best friend just posted a picture with her daughter and without her son. It\u2019s so heartbreaking to know she\u2019s been such a secret asshole this whole time. I\u2019m glad your mother would never do that to you, I can\u2019t imagine the trauma and pain it would cause you if your parents ever took any photos without all family members present. Truly, you are blessed.", "I would guess that if you surveyed parents' Facebook posts you would get a fairly even distribution of their children in posted photos. Not every photo would include every child, but you wouldn't see systematic exclusion of a specific child across the whole sample. Also, in this case we are talking about a professional photo sitting in which the mom specifically asked the photographer to take photos of her and her husband with her new biological child but excluding her stepchild.  If you don't see how that could be hurtful to the stepson I don't know what to tell you.", "You let her bully you into taking down your pfp with your family that excluded your stepson?

Esp if you come out doing/looking better.", "NTA.\n\nI think his mom had a weird moment. Not posting candids snapshots with your stepson doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s been excluded from the event/photo.

Whenever we do professional family pictures we always do one separately with each of our girls so they have their own special picture of them with us, even though for 1 I\u2019m step mom, she still deserves that special one on one with us and me.", "NTA Put the picture back up, talk to your ss mom and ask her if she wants the picture with her son on line - if she does you'll put it up, if not the other picture stays but she does not have the right to tell you what to post if she's already asked her son not be on media.", "NTA.
