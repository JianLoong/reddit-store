Like you said, he's too young to be on social media (and it would make zero sense for a mother to be so protective of her son's exposure on those platforms, to let him be on them when he's not of age). So she is either hiding her own feelings behind her son's name... or she showed him the photos to make him upset so she would have a reason to whine. Both are incredibly immature and assholey actions. \n\nI also have to assume this isn't the first time you've shared photos of your son, your husband, or any combination of you together that makes it clear you are a family. Sure, without context it could look like you're excluding your husband's oldest son. But she knows that's not the case. Plus, you did include the child in the photoshoot and have plenty of photos of the entire family. \n\nHer argument holds no weight.

This is something that can be calmly and rationally discussed amongst the adults.

You are looking at this as though this is a conflict between yourself and your stepson's mom, but the real issue here is you hurt your stepson's feelings which you don't seem to even consider.  You posted a family photo on social media that excluded your stepson.  You are sending the message out into the world that he is not part of your family, obviously he's going to be upset.  Plus, why would you want to broadcast that message to everyone you know?  There is nothing compelling you to post photos on social media, if you can't post photos that include your stepson, don't post full-family photos at all.  There are plenty of other ways to share photos with people, not everything needs to be on Facebook.", "NTA but have you told your stepson the reason you aren\u2019t posting pictures with him in them?

I don\u2019t you meant to exclude your stepson by posting this picture but I can kind of see your stepson\u2019s mom\u2019s point. You\u2019ve been in your stepson\u2019s life since he was 2 and he spends half of his time with you. Maybe in terms of biology and legality, you only have one child but practically and emotionally, you have two. Having a picture of you and your husband with just your son as your profile picture sends a message that in your mind you\u2019re a family of three, not four. It would be one thing if you posted this picture to wish your son a happy birthday or something. Also, if you didn\u2019t take a picture with just you, your husband and stepson or just your husband and stepson, that looks bad too. Why is your son the only one who got a solo picture with their parents?", "???? You made it look to everyone online that you were excluding your stepson on purpose.

I don\u2019t talk to the biomother, father deals with her, it\u2019s just not a fight worth having.", "Nothing in the post says bio mom walked out.  It sounds like she was in jail, but since she has been out they have 50/50 custody so her wishes do need to be considered, that is part of shared custody.", "Which was following the boy's mother's request, a woman who had already received a copy of the full family photo. The only way the 11 year old would know about the posted version was if his mother told him. She's trying to make drama where no harm was intended.", "That is a hard situation then. I do have a friend in a similar situation and they negotiated that her husband (the father) gets full decision making power, so he can post social media pictures and take the child across the border despite the mother having miminal visitation.\n\nAnd in your case, I see that not posting the pics is for the best but OP is in a situation where the relationship with the bio mom has been good until now and I feel like it is different.", "I was referring to the comment I replied to", "Again I'm not calling OP an asshole, but posting family pictures without one of your kids at that young age is not exactly a great look.\n\nThere were ample opportunities to ask a simple question. Showing the slightest bit of compassion. It goes a long way. I know no harm was intended, but the path to hell was paved with good intentions.\n\nProfessional family photos can be a big deal, so why not just send a text or ask when you're dropping them off.", "Ah got it."]}
