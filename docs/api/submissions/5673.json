She is now acting like a brat. She deserved consequences, but immediately giving away the rest of her gifts was not it. You should have put them away and had a discussion or three about her attitude. You could have brainstormed ways she could earn the rest of her gifts or something. Remember, too, that she is a hormonal 15-year-old. They act out. You had to become a mom at that age, so I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a bit of trauma surrounding this incident.\n\nIn other words, try not to react to your daughter.

You could have easily exchanged it but nope she wanted to be a brat and you handled that very well. Good on you", "I\u2019m going to preface this comment with the fact that I myself am her age.  Just acknowledging my own maturity and the maturity of my own peers, there\u2019s no way that the singular reason for her reaction was the iPad color and you cannot always take something like that at surface value. The world is not black and white and it isn\u2019t you\u2019re a spoiled brat or you aren\u2019t. Perhaps, she didn\u2019t get enough sleep the night before, had a rough morning, or wasn\u2019t plain feeling well and this was the last straw or trigger. It\u2019s completely possible yet doesn\u2019t seem to be considered by anybody.. as far as I\u2019ve seen in the comments. It\u2019s a reactionary and impulsive decision to immediately jump to giving away her presents and I know if my own mother did that to me I\u2019d be incredibly hurt and it would only escalate the situation rather than fix it. Considering, when we\u2019re so upset to the point of irrationality and in that state like your daughter seemed to be, there isn\u2019t time to step back and reflect \u201cis this an appropriate reaction?\u201d. It would\u2019ve been better to find a compromise like a pink case for the iPad as well as communicating with her and finding out if there were multiple instances that triggered her extreme reaction. The way I see it, you\u2019re being just as rash as she was in her reaction if you impulsively came to the conclusion if I give her gifts away it\u2019ll further prove my point.  It isn\u2019t realistic for somebody over the age of 10 to react that way in regards to a color unless there is something underlying as well.  All it does is prove your point, it doesn\u2019t help you cultivate a better relationship with her with strong communication that\u2019ll benefit both of you in the long run. I\u2019ve always felt my parents punishments caused me to lash out more as they\u2019re often rooted in instilling fear, you can\u2019t act this way again or this could happen.

You could store them at a friend's house or the car until the situation calmed down. Your daughter is obviously an AH as well, spoiled and entitled. And you should work on that with her, but step by step. Going in extremes, especially now that she is a teenager - that will backfire.", "NTA.

Work in a Petrol Station attached to a supermarket and couple years ago had a bloke come in on Boxing Day morning and ask what time store opened, explained it would be another hour and he looked like he was going to cry, asked what the issue was and he said he\u2019d brought all 3 of his kids brand new iPad minis for Xmas and they opened them on Boxing Day morning (separated family) and instantly all kicked off that they were minis and not full sized, he took the unopened iPads, put them and the kids in the car returned the kids to their mums and was waiting to get refunds, found out a week later (he came back in) he got full refunds on those as well as the game consoles they didn\u2019t know about and tvs and donated all the money to kids charities then sent the kids copies of the receipts to see exactly what they missed out on, \n\nSaw him the following year and they got \u00a3100 Amazon gift card and that was it,", "ESH, Her reaction is telling, you need to reevaluate the way you've raised your (very) spoiled daughter, and take steps from there.", "ESH.\n\nYes she should have been disciplined for acting out that way. But you giving away her gifts didn\u2019t resolve or de-escalate the situation, it only added fuel to the fire. It was probably uncomfortable for the rest of the family to see and ruined their holiday too.\n\nIt is often easy to return an unopened gift for a new color. If she had thanked you but asked politely for an exchange that would have been reasonable. Or if later she can get a pink case. Telling her she had to go sit in time out without electronics until she calmed down and apologized would have been fine.\n\nSo would have pausing gift opening for her and leaving them under the tree and asking her to apologize or help the family in some way with dinner before opening them again. \n\nDo you feel like perhaps you are often reacting to her in anger?", "ESH - your daughter is either spoiled, OR *if* this is out of character for her, then there\u2019s something deeper going on with her that you need to figure out and help her with. I\u2019m gonna be honest\u2026 your daughter threw a tantrum (inappropriate at her age), and you retaliated\u2026 with a tantrum and a power play. It\u2019s not great. \n\nGiving away all her gifts was not the move. She needs perspective, but by giving away all her new things she probably just feels like she can\u2019t trust you now. That\u2019s going to make turning around her behavior harder. (Yes, I know they were gifts, and no one is entitled to lots of gifts\u2026 but the gifts were given, done deal, so they were hers. Taking back gifts or giving away someone else\u2019s property is generally frowned upon for a reason.) In general, I probably would have packed up the iPad and not brought it back out until a conversation was had and a consequence was discussed/implemented. \n\nI\u2019ve overreacted with my kids too. We\u2019re not perfect, but we gotta be better than our parents were and admit when we make mistakes. Don\u2019t let your daughter off the hook, but apologize for how you handled things. Then talk to her about why her behavior was wrong. Ask her why she thought her reaction to the iPad was appropriate - hopefully she knows that what she did wasn\u2019t appropriate, but if she really doesn\u2019t you gotta talk to her about it. \n\nBut, from one mom to another, you\u2019re doing your best. This isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, and it\u2019s not too late to turn your kid\u2019s behavior around. Teens are often melodramatic and unpredictable from an adult perspective. If a teen never has outbursts at home, it\u2019s bc home isn\u2019t a safe space. So while this isn\u2019t ideal behavior from her, at least take comfort in the fact that she felt safe enough to have an outburst rather than swallow it down and not express anything to you at all. Hopefully in the future, she can learn to express herself in kinder & more mature ways.", "ESH. I would have been pissed too, but giving it away instead of just returning it made no sense. You lost your temper and did something impulsive and short-sighted.", "ESH. \n\nAt 15, she doesn\u2019t have the emotional control that you as an adult had. Her brain isn\u2019t fully formed. Was her response bad? Yup. A more realistic approach for you would have been to tuck the iPad away, let her pout in her room, then have a discussion about why that kind of behavior isn\u2019t appropriate. Then I\u2019d make her earn the iPad back by helping out around the house. The rest of the gifts could have been tucked away as well. \n\nInstead, you did the exact same thing she did. You got upset, stormed off, and internally blamed her for ruining your Christmas. \n\n\nIt sounds like both of you struggle with impulse control issues, and anger. I was a teen mom, I get how hard it is. But you\u2019re not a teen now. You\u2019re the adult. If your reaction to things is to respond with anger and storm out, then that\u2019s what she\u2019s also going to do, because kids learn by imitation. \n\nIt might be a good time to look into family counseling, and anger control methods for both of you.", "NTA.

I imagine that said friend had the awkward task of telling her kids that they couldn't keep the luxury gifts that had just been impulsively given to them out of spite. Common sense would tell me OP would be back for these expensive items once she had calmed down and the friend's kids shouldn't be roped into OP's fight with her daughter...", "Yep I had friends who treated Christmas wish lists as order forms, because they were used to getting everything on their list.  My parents encouraged us to write everything we wanted, no matter how ridiculous, but we knew we might not get anything on the list. My parents used it to find out what we liked and to get ideas what we might enjoy.

Maybe it's hormones. Maybe she needs therapy. Maybe she doesn't like the anxiety of being forced to be \"excited\" about Christmas. Maybe she's being bullied and there is some weird teenage connotation about blue vs pink ipads. I can't guess what the specific issue is, but I highly doubt it has anything really to do with the color or being a spoiled brat. \n\nFrom this post, I think that snatching up all her presents makes YTA but I understand why that was an overwhelming moment. I think you need to figure out what's going on here that's making your daughter lash out like this and try to help her solve it. 15 is very young still and 15 year olds make impulsive bad decisions, as I imagine you understand.", "Aw, that\u2019s sweet. Back in the 70s the stores used to do Christmas layaways, meaning you could bring two carts of toys to the service desk and they\u2019d calculate payments until Christmas.

That being said by impulsively bringing her gifts to a friend doesn't really teach her the lesson you want it to. You acted just like her (like mother, like daughter) just as an adult instead of a teenager. She didn't like what she got for a stupid reason, so she threw a fit and stormed off and isn't getting anything. You didn't like the reaction you got, so you threw a fit and stormed off and aren't getting the happy holiday you wanted. \n\nShe was wrong for her reaction, and so were you. Take away her gifts fine, sounds good. Not give them back any time soon, great idea. If you didn't want her to have them at all after her fit, then you should have made HER give them to those less fortunate, not you give them to a friend. All you did was show your daughter that throwing a fit and storming off is acceptable behavior because mommy did it too. If she had been made to give her gifts to those less fortunate, she would have been shown how lucky she actually was. Would it sink in right away? Probably not. It's going to take time and lots of volunteering with the less fortunate, but that, MAKING HER give the stuff away,  would have started to teach  her the lesson that being an ungrateful entilted spoiled brat has consequences and just how lucky she is you can provide for her like this.\n\nWhat you did isn't parenting, it was tit-for-tat and as a parent, not how you should be behaving in front of your daughter. Having her so young isn't an excuse.

Our worst enemy though is often your biases (look up cognitive psychology). If we don\u2019t actively challenge our biases, and train our empathy, you can see it as a muscle, our biases just becomes too overarching and they will shape our perceptions in a harmful way. We can\u2019t not have biases, it\u2019s a premises for being human but we can train them, and therefore train our ability to communicate without things escalating. \nCalling your daughter a spoiled brat and blaming you is really unintelligent and hurtful\u2026.

I finally learned what was happening inside that head of his, and then it was easy to change my behaviors to better support him. It made everyone's lives a million times better once the therapist helped us each understand where the other was coming from. Once I knew what was going on behind that temper of his, and because the therapist gave us tools to help with it, then everything just got easier. I wont break his confidentiality here but I will say that as a parent it broke my heart to learn what was happening inside that complicated head of his, and it doesn't always remove the sting from stuff he says when we do argue, but understanding it makes it easier to be supportive rather than reactive.

Based on your daughter\u2019s behaviour, she doesn\u2019t deserve any at all. That\u2019s what you should get her next year\u2026nothing.

She was incredibly rude to you and apparently has no remorse.", "YTA People love raising brats then complaining that they're ungrateful", "ESH", "YTA for the simple reason that you did not give your daughter a chance to redress her behaviour before you huffed and puffed out the door.", "YTA this was not the way to start fixing the problem you have been creating for fifteen years.", "Esh\u2026your kid is a brat, but taking away all the presents and giving them away?   I would have made her earn them back.", "What the hell is up with all these Y T A?? \n\nWhen I was a kid my sister was exactly like your child. She once opened a gift and it was a iPad mini (she had wanted the regular) she threw a fit and my dad smacked her in the mouth and gave the iPad away to his friends kid who had the old for 7 years. \n\nMy opinion: NTA. You are trying to give your kid a good life (more than most) and are giving her gifts which she did not appreciate. But you also have to understand that you  raised her this way and need to rethink strategies to make your child a grateful person whilst being able to have gifts and be shown appreciation towards. If you are able to do that then NTA if you don\u2019t. Well then you bring this upon yourself.", "NTA\n\nI do agree with many other commenters that your daughter has issues that need addressed but Christmas gifts aren't required, especially over a color of an ipad. She needs some humility and gifting her when she is acting like this shouldn't happen.", "NTA. If she is throwing a $500 iPad at 15 she doesn\u2019t need anything, especially over a freaking color! Nope, actions have consequences, she wants to throw things, she don\u2019t get things. Parents bust their asses for Christmas and she is old enough to understand that.", "INFO - Has your daughter previously behaved in a spoiled way? Does she always behave like she's entitled to get what she wants when she wants it? Or has she mostly been a reasonable kid? \n\nWas everything else completely fine before Christmas? Both in her life and between you and her?", "NTA - A tantrum shouldn't be rewarded and gratefulness should be learned. I would have done the same in your situation. However, I might have held on to the presents in the event she truly was apologetic and learned her lesson so I could reward that behavior. \n\nIf of course lol. Great parenting!", "Esh. You were 15 when you had her, so you were obviously immature and unprepared to raise a child. You've probably sacrificed quite a bit to give her what she has now. I commend you for doing what you could every day. \n\nThat being said, instantly giving away all her presents is a massively dramatic overreaction. Who does something like that? Emotionally-stunted, immature people do that. The kind of people that raise teenagers to throw a fit when they don't get the right color iPad.\n\nMaybe, somehow, we're wrong and assuming things that didn't happen. What you've written doesn't inspire much confidence, though.", "NTA. No body is owed anything in this life and sometimes you have to draw a very firm line. Sounds like you have indulged her for a long time and your daughter needs to learn no to take you for granted. Was your reaction over the top? Maybe, but better to learn now at 15 then 20 or 25 when you lose friends and maybe jobs for behaving this way. Hopefully you guys can build a healthier parent child relationship", "You are supposed to be the adult and the parent. It is your job to model impulse control and emotional regulation. Yes, your child was a brat, but you really behaved badly. We get YTA instead of everyone sucks because only one of you is an adult.", "ESH", "ETA\nThe thing is, kids act like this when they are already spoiled. Rarely does this behavior come out of nowhere. I applaud what you did. She sounds very ungrateful, and rude. \nBut at the same time, I would really take a serious thought about how you have raised her. She is only 15, and there is still hope to reteach behavior.\nAnd family members taking her side might be a thing too. How close is she to them? Do they spoil her?", "I may get downvoted, while the daughter was an extremely entitled brat, i say YTA. This has some vibes of the post where the kid got suspended, mother returned all the christmas gifts, father was enraged and repurchased all the gifts except for onevthat was sold out, only to come home to find the wife ripping apart the house looking for the receipts so she could return the gifts again. I think you went to the far extreme instead of trying to talk to your daughter first. Maybe after the talk your daughter may have been calmer and had a better understanding of why you purchased blue instead of pink. Yes she should be glad she got it at all, but you taking away and then giving away all her presents will just make her resent you. And believe me, whether you think it's a lesson learned, she will resent what you did years from now because even though she was ungrateful about the color, you went to the utmost extreme.", "YTA\n\nThe reason your daughter threw a tantrum is because you taught her that tantrums are an appropriate way to respond to the slightest bit of disappointment or adversity. Yes, she should have better coping and communication skills by this age, but you can\u2019t learn those skills in a vacuum.", "In trying to give your child the best life ever, did you by any chance spoil her?

Tell her she can get a pink protective case to cover up the blue.", "ESH\n\nShe was ungrateful, but at the same time you could have just had a long talk with her about being appreciative. The way you handled it was a little harsh.", "ESH. This kind of behavior doesn't spring up over night, how often does she behave this way and are there ever any consequences? If you never have given her a reason to not behave this way before, then suddenly went with nuclear option, that doesn't seem right. But at the same time of course her behavior was that of an AH. A huge AH. So there's some kind of disconnect there because that level of tantrum is not age appropriate.", "NTA. I am amazed at the comments excusing the daughter. Hormones, sleeping patterns, being bullied. Give me a break. \n\nShe received an iPad! Threw it down and called mom hurtful names over a color! Of course it, and all her other gifts, need to leave the home. \n\nPosts that were helpful suggested hiding them til a good discussion. I can agree with that. I still would have returned them this week. \n\nWhat I dislike here was giving them to her friend\u2019s children. Here are little Susie, Jose, and Shaniqua opening gifts addressed Merry Christmas Hannah (or whatever her name is) from Mom. Those kids now know the gifts weren\u2019t selected to show care about their interests or hobbies.", "YTA you raised a brat and then punished her for being a brat.

The child is spoiled.  \n\nWhat you *should* have done; is beyond the scope of advice from this forum.

The child threw an iPad because of the COLOR! I would have returned the gifts and got my money back. Your child needs to learn real quick that your responsibility as a parent is to provide a roof over her head, food in her stomach, clothes and love which are basic human needs. Everything else is a want and she is not entitled to it.", "Your daughter is a huge spoiled brat , ew", "NTA. If you act like an ass, you get treated like one. I don\u2019t reward bad behavior. I wish my child(ren) would act like this. Me giving away their gifts would be the least of their worries. I\u2019ll get downvoted I\u2019m sure. But I refuse to reward disrespectful children(people). Yes you have to teach your kids and I do understand teenagers will be teenagers. But they are not exempt from facing either consequences or enjoying the benefits of their choices. The teenager acted out and OP superseded that. I bet she\u2019ll think twice before she does it again. Merry Christmas OP. But next time return the presents and get your money back. Or better yet keep them and only give one gift  to your daughter for her birthdays until they are finally given to her. She wouldn\u2019t get that blue iPad until she\u2019s 25. Lol.

It's to talk to your kid and find out what the f is going on. This is the kind of behaviour changes you're told to look out for that kids can display if they're being bullied, or sexually abused etc.\n\nIn the to case of B) why hasn't OP provided the context. If the kid is generally quite spoilt and expects to be given everything, and this is in character, why does OP seem surprised, and why hasn't she addressed it before now? Why but the wrong colour knowing daughter would flip, not say anything, and then lose it when she flips? Doesn't make sense. \n\nIf there are other issues between daughter and OP that OP isn't disclosing, it possibly wasn't 'just because of the wrong colour iPad' and OP is omitting background to make themselves look better. In that case taking her presents is EVEN WORSE. \n\nOPs immediate response was to gather up all the presents, put them in the car and leave (as opposed to like, just putting them away and say she can't have them, or tell her they need to have a conversation about her behaviour before she decides if she could have them).
