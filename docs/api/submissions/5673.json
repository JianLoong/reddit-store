She is now acting like a brat. She deserved consequences, but immediately giving away the rest of her gifts was not it. You should have put them away and had a discussion or three about her attitude. You could have brainstormed ways she could earn the rest of her gifts or something. Remember, too, that she is a hormonal 15-year-old. They act out. You had to become a mom at that age, so I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a bit of trauma surrounding this incident.\n\nIn other words, try not to react to your daughter.

You could have easily exchanged it but nope she wanted to be a brat and you handled that very well. Good on you", "I\u2019m going to preface this comment with the fact that I myself am her age.  Just acknowledging my own maturity and the maturity of my own peers, there\u2019s no way that the singular reason for her reaction was the iPad color and you cannot always take something like that at surface value. The world is not black and white and it isn\u2019t you\u2019re a spoiled brat or you aren\u2019t. Perhaps, she didn\u2019t get enough sleep the night before, had a rough morning, or wasn\u2019t plain feeling well and this was the last straw or trigger. It\u2019s completely possible yet doesn\u2019t seem to be considered by anybody.. as far as I\u2019ve seen in the comments. It\u2019s a reactionary and impulsive decision to immediately jump to giving away her presents and I know if my own mother did that to me I\u2019d be incredibly hurt and it would only escalate the situation rather than fix it. Considering, when we\u2019re so upset to the point of irrationality and in that state like your daughter seemed to be, there isn\u2019t time to step back and reflect \u201cis this an appropriate reaction?\u201d. It would\u2019ve been better to find a compromise like a pink case for the iPad as well as communicating with her and finding out if there were multiple instances that triggered her extreme reaction. The way I see it, you\u2019re being just as rash as she was in her reaction if you impulsively came to the conclusion if I give her gifts away it\u2019ll further prove my point.  It isn\u2019t realistic for somebody over the age of 10 to react that way in regards to a color unless there is something underlying as well.  All it does is prove your point, it doesn\u2019t help you cultivate a better relationship with her with strong communication that\u2019ll benefit both of you in the long run. I\u2019ve always felt my parents punishments caused me to lash out more as they\u2019re often rooted in instilling fear, you can\u2019t act this way again or this could happen.

You could store them at a friend's house or the car until the situation calmed down. Your daughter is obviously an AH as well, spoiled and entitled. And you should work on that with her, but step by step. Going in extremes, especially now that she is a teenager - that will backfire.", "NTA.

Work in a Petrol Station attached to a supermarket and couple years ago had a bloke come in on Boxing Day morning and ask what time store opened, explained it would be another hour and he looked like he was going to cry, asked what the issue was and he said he\u2019d brought all 3 of his kids brand new iPad minis for Xmas and they opened them on Boxing Day morning (separated family) and instantly all kicked off that they were minis and not full sized, he took the unopened iPads, put them and the kids in the car returned the kids to their mums and was waiting to get refunds, found out a week later (he came back in) he got full refunds on those as well as the game consoles they didn\u2019t know about and tvs and donated all the money to kids charities then sent the kids copies of the receipts to see exactly what they missed out on, \n\nSaw him the following year and they got \u00a3100 Amazon gift card and that was it,", "ESH, Her reaction is telling, you need to reevaluate the way you've raised your (very) spoiled daughter, and take steps from there.", "ESH.\n\nYes she should have been disciplined for acting out that way. But you giving away her gifts didn\u2019t resolve or de-escalate the situation, it only added fuel to the fire. It was probably uncomfortable for the rest of the family to see and ruined their holiday too.\n\nIt is often easy to return an unopened gift for a new color. If she had thanked you but asked politely for an exchange that would have been reasonable. Or if later she can get a pink case. Telling her she had to go sit in time out without electronics until she calmed down and apologized would have been fine.\n\nSo would have pausing gift opening for her and leaving them under the tree and asking her to apologize or help the family in some way with dinner before opening them again. \n\nDo you feel like perhaps you are often reacting to her in anger?", "ESH - your daughter is either spoiled, OR *if* this is out of character for her, then there\u2019s something deeper going on with her that you need to figure out and help her with. I\u2019m gonna be honest\u2026 your daughter threw a tantrum (inappropriate at her age), and you retaliated\u2026 with a tantrum and a power play. It\u2019s not great. \n\nGiving away all her gifts was not the move. She needs perspective, but by giving away all her new things she probably just feels like she can\u2019t trust you now. That\u2019s going to make turning around her behavior harder. (Yes, I know they were gifts, and no one is entitled to lots of gifts\u2026 but the gifts were given, done deal, so they were hers. Taking back gifts or giving away someone else\u2019s property is generally frowned upon for a reason.) In general, I probably would have packed up the iPad and not brought it back out until a conversation was had and a consequence was discussed/implemented. \n\nI\u2019ve overreacted with my kids too. We\u2019re not perfect, but we gotta be better than our parents were and admit when we make mistakes. Don\u2019t let your daughter off the hook, but apologize for how you handled things. Then talk to her about why her behavior was wrong. Ask her why she thought her reaction to the iPad was appropriate - hopefully she knows that what she did wasn\u2019t appropriate, but if she really doesn\u2019t you gotta talk to her about it. \n\nBut, from one mom to another, you\u2019re doing your best. This isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, and it\u2019s not too late to turn your kid\u2019s behavior around. Teens are often melodramatic and unpredictable from an adult perspective. If a teen never has outbursts at home, it\u2019s bc home isn\u2019t a safe space. So while this isn\u2019t ideal behavior from her, at least take comfort in the fact that she felt safe enough to have an outburst rather than swallow it down and not express anything to you at all. Hopefully in the future, she can learn to express herself in kinder & more mature ways.", "ESH. I would have been pissed too, but giving it away instead of just returning it made no sense. You lost your temper and did something impulsive and short-sighted.", "ESH. \n\nAt 15, she doesn\u2019t have the emotional control that you as an adult had. Her brain isn\u2019t fully formed. Was her response bad? Yup. A more realistic approach for you would have been to tuck the iPad away, let her pout in her room, then have a discussion about why that kind of behavior isn\u2019t appropriate. Then I\u2019d make her earn the iPad back by helping out around the house. The rest of the gifts could have been tucked away as well. \n\nInstead, you did the exact same thing she did. You got upset, stormed off, and internally blamed her for ruining your Christmas. \n\n\nIt sounds like both of you struggle with impulse control issues, and anger. I was a teen mom, I get how hard it is. But you\u2019re not a teen now. You\u2019re the adult. If your reaction to things is to respond with anger and storm out, then that\u2019s what she\u2019s also going to do, because kids learn by imitation. \n\nIt might be a good time to look into family counseling, and anger control methods for both of you.", "NTA.

I imagine that said friend had the awkward task of telling her kids that they couldn't keep the luxury gifts that had just been impulsively given to them out of spite. Common sense would tell me OP would be back for these expensive items once she had calmed down and the friend's kids shouldn't be roped into OP's fight with her daughter...", "Yep I had friends who treated Christmas wish lists as order forms, because they were used to getting everything on their list.  My parents encouraged us to write everything we wanted, no matter how ridiculous, but we knew we might not get anything on the list.

Maybe it's hormones. Maybe she needs therapy. Maybe she doesn't like the anxiety of being forced to be \"excited\" about Christmas. Maybe she's being bullied and there is some weird teenage connotation about blue vs pink ipads. I can't guess what the specific issue is, but I highly doubt it has anything really to do with the color or being a spoiled brat. \n\nFrom this post, I think that snatching up all her presents makes YTA but I understand why that was an overwhelming moment. I think you need to figure out what's going on here that's making your daughter lash out like this and try to help her solve it. 15 is very young still and 15 year olds make impulsive bad decisions, as I imagine you understand.", "Aw, that\u2019s sweet. Back in the 70s the stores used to do Christmas layaways, meaning you could bring two carts of toys to the service desk and they\u2019d calculate payments until Christmas.

That being said by impulsively bringing her gifts to a friend doesn't really teach her the lesson you want it to. You acted just like her (like mother, like daughter) just as an adult instead of a teenager.

You didn't like the reaction you got, so you threw a fit and stormed off and aren't getting the happy holiday you wanted. \n\nShe was wrong for her reaction, and so were you. Take away her gifts fine, sounds good. Not give them back any time soon, great idea. If you didn't want her to have them at all after her fit, then you should have made HER give them to those less fortunate, not you give them to a friend. All you did was show your daughter that throwing a fit and storming off is acceptable behavior because mommy did it too. If she had been made to give her gifts to those less fortunate, she would have been shown how lucky she actually was. Would it sink in right away? Probably not. It's going to take time and lots of volunteering with the less fortunate, but that, MAKING HER give the stuff away,  would have started to teach  her the lesson that being an ungrateful entilted spoiled brat has consequences and just how lucky she is you can provide for her like this.\n\nWhat you did isn't parenting, it was tit-for-tat and as a parent, not how you should be behaving in front of your daughter.

Our worst enemy though is often your biases (look up cognitive psychology). If we don\u2019t actively challenge our biases, and train our empathy, you can see it as a muscle, our biases just becomes too overarching and they will shape our perceptions in a harmful way. We can\u2019t not have biases, it\u2019s a premises for being human but we can train them, and therefore train our ability to communicate without things escalating. \nCalling your daughter a spoiled brat and blaming you is really unintelligent and hurtful\u2026.

I finally learned what was happening inside that head of his, and then it was easy to change my behaviors to better support him. It made everyone's lives a million times better once the therapist helped us each understand where the other was coming from. Once I knew what was going on behind that temper of his, and because the therapist gave us tools to help with it, then everything just got easier. I wont break his confidentiality here but I will say that as a parent it broke my heart to learn what was happening inside that complicated head of his, and it doesn't always remove the sting from stuff he says when we do argue, but understanding it makes it easier to be supportive rather than reactive.

You are trying to give your kid a good life (more than most) and are giving her gifts which she did not appreciate.

What can be harsh for some can be lenient for others. sometimes kids behave like this because they have been spoiled rotten, other times it's just teenagers at peak teenage drama. Not all teenage dramatics is the direct result of terrible parenting. Sometimes it is just the natural hormonal self absorbed head in ass, that comes with the age, and they do need a wake up call.
