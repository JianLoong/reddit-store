He cheated on her Mum with mine and got pregnant with me maybe a year later. We moved to another city and he didn't have much contact with her after that. I saw her a handful of times as a child but moved near her for university and began having a proper relationship with her then. I moved back but still see her about twice a year. Our Dad hadn't seen her in about a decade when he passed.\n\nSo when he did pass this summer his house (which my Mum co-owened) and it's contents went to me and the money (savings and insurance) was split 50/50 between the two of us. The first payment was received earlier this month.\n\nI have absolutely zero issue with this arrangement but she didn't even attend the funeral. She didn't offer to help with the admin stuff. I did all of it on my own. On the day of the funeral she tagged herself and a bunch of friends at a restaurant. \n\nI get that my Dad let her down. He routinely bailed on plans, forgot birthdays etc but it just doesn't sit right with me that she took his money but didn't even show up to the funeral. \n\nI met her for lunch on Boxing Day and told her my feelings. That I thought it was disrespectful for her to take the cash but not offer to help me with any of the arrangements or even show up to the funeral. I wasn't angry and I didn't raise my voice. She did cry and left rather abruptly. That night she sent me a bunch of messages calling me unbelievably rude and that I'm an arsehole for making her feel bad for being mad at her for taking what she is owed. I really didn't think I was being rude but perhaps I'm too close to the situation. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672175897, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwqhqx/aita_for_calling_out_my_sister_for_not_showing_up/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had to come to terms with the fact he loved you, cherished you, and took care of you - and she was an afterthought at best.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe going to his funeral, nor does she owe any labor on it.  Chances are, any thought of him dredges up understandable resentment about a sperm donor who bailed on her life.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t see her for 10 years while he was alive. \n\nYou are too close to the situation, and what you said was absolutely horrendous.  You are grieving, and it\u2019s absolutely ok to grieve the father you loved.  It\u2019s not ok to project that onto a former child who was abandoned by the same man you loved.  \n\nYou owe her some big, big apologies if you hope to have a chance of mending that relationship.", "YTA\n\n>I get that my Dad let her down.\n\nWell this is the understatement of the year. If you're using language like this, and saying that he was \"not a great Dad to her,\"  then you clearly don't \"get\" it. He cheated on her mom, ran off with his mistress, and abandoned her as an infant.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable for her not to attend his funeral and still accept the inheritance.  You were completely out of line.", "YTA. Leaving her an inheritance is the least he could do after bailing on her as a dad. YOU got the happy life with a present father. Not her. I understand her not wanting to go to the funeral or have anything to do with it. She still deserves her inheritance.  She was not rude, she simply didn\u2019t go to the funeral of a man that abandoned her and constantly disappointed her. Try to put yourself in her shoes.", "YTA- You got the house in addition to a 50/50 share of the cash.  Even in death he treated you better than her.  She owes neither of you any effort in the final arrangements.", ">my Dad let her down. He routinely bailed on plans, forgot birthdays etc\n\nShe probably wanted to come... But something popped up. Don't blame her, she takes after her dad in that part.\n\nYTA... You lost your dad recently.... She lost him years ago!", "Lol why would she show up to the funeral of the man who cheated on her mother and then moved away and didn't contact her for years? YTA", "YTA. It sounds like your sister had a single mom and a deadbeat dad. I would collect my money and leave the clean up to his real family, too.\n\nYou're allowed to feel however you feel but it's important to remember that your point of view isn't the only one and while you may think you understand her point of view,  you don't because you had a dad and it sounds like she had a cheating sperm donor.", "YTA\n\nIf your father sucked that much, the inheritance is the very least she should get. Did he even pay child support?", "YTA. He treated her badly by ignoring her for YOU. You owe her an apology.", "YTA\n\nYour mother could help you. You know the woman who he was cheating.", "YTA.  \n\n\nShe is not obligated to go to a funeral for a man who couldn't be bothered with her for most of her life.  \n\n\nLet these payments be retribution on the relationship he CHOSE to have with her.  Which is practically non-existent.  \n\nHe may have been good to you, but by your own admission he sucked as a father to her.", "YTA. Your father was horrible to her and her mother! She\u2019s not obligated to attend his funeral or tell help with any of the administrative stuff! She cut contact with him for reason and you don\u2019t get it dictate if she grieves or how she does it. You can have whatever feelings you want on these issues, but to call her out was rude and selfish after what she been through. Put yourself in her shoes for a minute", "YTA It doesn't need to sit right with you because it's not about you. \n\nYou're mad because she didn't do what you wanted her to do, what you thought was right. But what you think is irrelevant. She did what she thought was best based on her relationship with him. He was a shit dad to her. He abandoned her. The effects of that don't disappear just because he left her money", "Ok, YTA but I\u2019m going to explain why in a slightly different way to others. \n\nI have a shit dad who left when I was 4/5 and who I have seen on a handful of occasions since then. I\u2019m in my mid thirties. By the time I hit my teens, I realised I didn\u2019t want any contact with him and I cut him out of my life.\n\nNow, if he died, I wouldn\u2019t grieve him. I wouldn\u2019t go to his funeral. But if he left me money, I would take it. Because his being a shit dad has affected my life in far more ways and with far more baggage than any sum of money is worth. But I\u2019d take that money, and if anyone suggested I should have helped out with winding up his estate and going to his funeral, I\u2019d be livid. I don\u2019t owe my shit dad anything. I don\u2019t owe him my time or my energy. I don\u2019t owe anyone me having to go through that process - which is not an emotionally neutral process. Because me having to interact with his existence in any way stirs up emotions. I will not go to his funeral and sit there and listen to people eulogise a man who hurt me deeply. I will not sit and take platitudes from well wishers who are sorry for my loss, when I am not sorry and it isn\u2019t my loss because he never brought anything positive to my life. \n\nAnd that is what you are demanding your sister do. You\u2019re grieving, but she has grief of her own that is very very different. Losing a parent who essentially abandoned you, and losing the chance of ever having a reunion (even if you rationally don\u2019t want one) is *incredibly* difficult. You lost a man you love; she lost a man who made it clear he didn\u2019t care about her, and she lost the chance at any hypothetical reunion where he might suddenly care. Hell, him leaving her money probably even feels loaded (unless he died intestate and this is the outcome of probate) because it is loaded when it comes from someone who you have no relationship with. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying may come across as very angry, and it is - because that is how I would feel if anyone tried to tell me how to mourn my father and what I should or should not be doing for appearance\u2019s sake, or that I owed him or anyone else (including my sibling) me going through any of the pain that would entail.", "YTA - funerals are for the living, not for the dead. Granted, that sometimes means showing up to support the rest of your family, but it doesn't sound like that's especially applicable in her situation.\n\nIf he'd wanted to stipulate she shouldn't take the money unless she came to the funeral, he could've. He didn't. But don't expect her to share your grief because your relationships aren't the same. Your inheritance is because you were his child. Hers is because he failed her. You very much owe her an apology.", "Yta after everything your dad put your sister through the money is the least he owed her", "Well, Everything she said was right. Your father destroyed her family, abandoned her and her mother, and used you as a replacement. Why should she help with that kind of person's funeral? He owed her every cent of what she got and more, and she was under no obligation to  help celebrate the life of a man who ruined hers. \n\nYTA. Hugely. No room for discussion, end of story, bye bye, See you later.", "Would you attend the funeral of someone you hadn't seen or spoken to in ten years?  Your sister owed your father nothing. I'm so sorry for your loss, but your sister was under no obligation to help or attend. YTA", "Sorry buddy, but YTA. You may biologically share a father but you did not have the same one. Her experience with him was worlds different than yours. It\u2019s great that you had a good, healthy relationship with him but your sister is right\u2026she is owed that inheritance, for all the ways that he failed her in life. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss but it\u2019s absolutely unfair to expect your sister to be the bigger person than your dad in his death when he failed her so completely in her life.", "YTA.  Inheritance entitlement has nothing to do with helping with the funeral arrangements.  Your feelings of sadness and frustration at the situation might be valid but the person to vent to is a therapist - not your sister, who you acknowledge had a very difficult relationship with your father.", "YTA. The inheritance isn\u2019t dependent on her involvement in administering stuff for the funeral. She\u2019s entitled to her inheritance regardless and you don\u2019t get to dictate her actions or judge her.", "Yes, YTA. You have to realize that you may have had the same father, but you had very different dads. Her experience with him was much different -- and, it seems, worse -- than yours. She didn't owe him respect. She didn't owe him her attendance at the funeral. She doesn't owe him (or you) any sympathy. You abided by your dad's wishes, which was the right thing to do, but she doesn't owe you thanks or help for doing that.\n\nI'm sorry about your dad.", "YTA. That man treated her like shit. He is her father and she didn't even get half of his belongings, only his money which is usually less in value to begin with before splitting it.\n\nEven if she did get half of everything... He still treated her like shit. It is her right to inherit. It is not his right to be respected by her in death when he didn't respect her in life.\n\nShe did the sane thing and you should be ashamed of yourself. Imagine being abandoned by your own father and then being told by the child he chose to stay with(the result of his cheating probably!) that you should've attended his funeral.... You don't deserve being forgiven before you're properly apologised and then some.", "Your dad bailed on her as a child and apparently never reconciled with her. She grieved his loss several years ago and she didn\u2019t owe him anything. She wasn\u2019t obligated to turn down her inheritance either. I know you are grieving and I\u2019m support for your loss but in this YTA.", "YTA. Your dad completely abandoned her for you and your mom. I'm sure she grieved the loss of her father decades ago. As far as the Inheritance, consider that the bare minimum he could have done for her. And why in the world would she help with any of the arrangements for the man who, to reiterate, abandoned her as a child?!?!?! \n\nI do understand that you're grieving, but this man wasn't her father. He was just a sperm donor.\n\nEdit: typos", "YTA. You owe her a huge apology.", "YTA. Your dad was a bad dad to her. She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. Inheritance is the least he can do", "YTA, your dad picked you and your mom over her. She's had a lifetime of hurt. You got the father, she got maybe child support? It's fair that you had to deal with the admin stuff and she just got the money. You could have paid someone to deal with that stuff if you didn't want to, not guilt the sister that already lost out on so much.", "YTA. You don't know what it's like to have a terrible father that was a great parent to one child but abandoned the second. Everything he was to you he wasn't to her. \n\nQuite honestly, death doesn't erase what he did to her. He chose not to be a father to her. He chose to abandon her. He chose to not have a relationship with her. He chose to leave her an inheritance knowing they weren't in contact with each other. \n\nShe shouldn't fake an attitude of gratitude towards him just because you want her to. It's not about you.", "YTA  You got to grow up with your mom and dad, you got to have a dad who was present and involved in your life, you were loved.  She was abandoned and ignored by her father, he disappointed her and didn't make an effort to show up for her.  You got the bulk of the inheritance and therfore delt with the legal hassle.  You had a good relationship with your dad and wanted to go to his funeral.  She had a terrible relationship with her absent father and didn't want to go to his funeral.  \n\nIf you want to maintain a relationship with your sister, you need to recognize that you had a much different experience growing up and apologize to her.", "YTA.\n\nIt's really not your business on how other people respond to a death, and the inheritance is not tied to funeral attendance. \n\nBasically, it boils down to \"mind your own business and leave people alone.\"\n\nMore specifically, you two had extremely different relationships with your dad. It's clear you don't actually understand her basic situation and are dismissive of her own experience.", "YTA She owes him nothing, by your own admission he wasn\u2019t there for her.", "Honest question, what did you expect from her?", "YTA. He was never there for her like he was you. Are you able to comprehend what that means?", "YTA. Your dad did not deserve her time or respect. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss, but your sister is not in the wrong here.", "Judgie much? You're angry she didn't attend the funeral of someone who was abusive toward her? Your pissed she's getting an inheritance from someone who was abusive toward her? Sounds like she deserves the inheritance. You're being petty.\n\noops to add YTA", "YTA \n\nSo she missed one of his events but think about ALL the events and life moments of hers that he missed. \n\nIt\u2019s great you had a wonderful father but she had an absolutely terrible one that abandoned her. I know it can be hard to reconcile the fact that both of those are the same man, but it is the truth. \n\nYou need to apologize if you want any hope of ever having a relationship with her. From her eyes you are the child her own dad ditched her for, now the kid her dad liked so much better than her that he never spoke to her again is mad she didn\u2019t do enough for her \u201cgreat\u201d father. Get outta here. I know none of that is your fault in anyway and I\u2019m sure she does too but it still hurts.", "YTA your dad chose to leave his money with your sister just like he chose to abandon her. Seems she's respecting all his wishes by taking the money and not showing up.", "YTA.  It's none of your business how her relationship is with others or how she reacts to the death of a loved one or anyone for that matter.  She can take the cash and run if she wants to - there are no strings attached and it's not up to you.  Stay in your lane and worry about yourself and stop causing drama.", "YTA, this is a man who routinely failed her, sure, he might've given the world to you, but to her it probably seemed like pieces of hers were given to you, and then you slap her in the face with \"Well it's shitty you wouldn't show up now that he's gone\" WHY WOULD SHE?! He never had the decency to show up to her BIRTHDAY!!!! Take a step back and think, and put yourself in her shoes. Imagine you were the one who was always left out, would you still be jumping to his funeral?", "YTA. You have no idea what it\u2019s like to be abandoned by your parent for another child. You even know that he was a shit father to her. It probably doesn\u2019t sit right with her that he probably remembered your birthday and was involved in your life as a child.", "YTA. She's right he owes her. It's great he took care of you but he abandoned her. She has a right to be upset and deal with his passing how she sees fit. You're upset about his passing too and maybe should have reached out to another family member for help. But if it was left to her she's allowed to take it.", "YTA \n\nMoney will never give your sister back what she lost in her father. You have no right to judge her right now as you have no idea the loss she felt in her life.", "YTA\nHe f didn't show up for birthdays, why should she show up for the funeral. As for the inheritance, you got the lion's share like all the rest of your life while she got the short end of the stick again and yet you have the audacity to criticise her?", "She's legally entitled to the inheritance, which, if you are objective about, is skewed in your favor. \n\nShe doesn't have a relationship with your dad, there was nothing for her to grieve. You are hurting, sure, but don't  guilt her for not loving your father as you did. To her, he might just be the sperm donor.", "YTA\nTotally fine to not attend a funeral when you don't have contact to that person.\nAlso legit legit to get the inheritance as damage payment.\n\nYou can be grateful to her she did not interfere with the funeral plannings in a negative way. So she showed respect. \n\nYou can be lucky he was a good father to you. I have several friends who told me similar situations: That dads start a new family. They try to compensate the bad relationship with their older kids by giving all the love to the new family. Good for the new family, very bad for the forgotten kids.", "YTA. She\u2019s entitled to her inheritance as his daughter. It\u2019s the least he could do given she has gone a large portion of her life without a dad.", "Yes yta. You even know he was a bad dad to her.  He wasn't there for her in life, why would she be there for him in death?", "Why would she attend the funeral of man who didn't even care about her. The inheritance was your Dad's way of trying to make it right especially if didnt pay child support. If he didn't want her to have it he wouldn't have left it. She had no obligation to help you with his estate. Yta and probably forever ruined your relationship with her.", "YTA. Your dad was a cheater who destroyed your sister's family and then abandoned her, and I'm not surprised she chose not to attend his funeral. Regardless, none of that has anything to do with her inheritance. He left her money, she has received it, end of story. You are out of line, and yes, you were rude and judgemental.\n\nYou had a great relationship with your dad and a nice childhood, but that happened *at your half-sister's expense*. She didn't have a dad because he abandoned her for you and your mother.", ">He cheated on her Mum with mine and got pregnant with me maybe a year later. We moved to another city and didn\u2019t have much contact with her after that.\n\nHe cheated on her mom, had another kid and basically abandoned her. She owes him nothing and he owes her everything.

Full stop.", "YTA-  I have a \u201cbiological didn\u2019t bother\u201d so I completely understand her- you have a VERY different relationship with him than she does\u2026.

No one is obligated to attend a funeral.", "He was a dad for you, but abandoned her.

YTA.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine the guilt she\u2019s feeling and you absolutely made it 100% worse.", "YTA - You yourself admit that he left her and her mom for your mom and had you, moved away and had minimal contact.  Her dad is not your dad, accept that you both know the man as two different people.  She owes him nothing, as he never really gave her anything.  Apologize to your sister.", "YTA.  A little judgemental, no?  Everyone processes grief differently.  You owe her a sincere apology.  She's had a tough, sad road with your daddy and you're showing absolutely no empathy.  And your mom was the homewrecker, right?", "Gently, but hell, yes, YTA.", "I'm not going to call you out here with a judgement, but you don't get to dictate what she has to do. She is entitled to the inheritance. She reasonably has very valid mixed feelings about your father's treatment of her. She wasn't required to go to the funeral. \n\nNow if you want to try to maintain a relationship with her, that's a different issue. She doesn't have to honor your father to do so. You're grieving now so it's all pretty raw, but hopefully you two can find a way to get on the same page again. You are sisters, after all. Your relationship doesn't have to be about your father.", "YTA. You don't get to decide how someone grieves especially in these circumstances. You don't know how much trauma she is carrying being let down by a primary caregiver. This will have impacted her and she owed him nothing in terms of going to the funeral.", "Yta. \nYou admit yourself he was lousy to her. She owes him nothing and is entitled to her share of the inheritance\u2026 hell she should be getting more than you even as damages.", "YTA. You had entirely different relationships. Having an estranged parent is extremely challenging. It impacts everything in your life\u2026every day of your life. The purpose of going to funerals is to show respect for the person that died or to support the family. I doubt she respected your dad since he didn\u2019t respect her. It also sounds like she didn\u2019t have a relationship with the family he was in contact with. So why would she need to go to the funeral?\n\nIt sounds like she is entitled to the money without a requirement to feel a certain way or do certain things before receiving it.", "YTA\n\nYou said it yourself; you had a great relationship with your dad but she didn't. Try to see it from her point of view.\n\nYour dad destroyed her family because he cheated. Then he moved away from her to be with his new wife and second child. He constantly let her down by skipping plans and milestones. Can you imagine being a child whose father regularly forgets her birthday? Your dad abandoned your sister. You have memories of a loving dad. She has memories of a man who failed her. The inheritance is the very least he could have done. \n\nHelping with the funeral or attending would have been to painful for her. Cut her some slack. I recommend apologizing if you want to salvage the relationship.", "You\u2019re grieving and so is she. Everyone grieves differently. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like they didn\u2019t really have a relationship- so why would she feel compelled to go to the funeral? I get that he was her dad biologically but he wasn\u2019t her dad in reality. \n\nThat money might have been your dads way of making up for all the lunches, events, and times he missed with her. Please don\u2019t give her a hard time about this or it will be a decade before the two of you speak again.", "YTA", "YTA. You had a great dad, she did not. He cheated on her mom and broke up their family to create yours. He didn't attend her events, forgot plans, and forgot her birthday. For her, he was her sperm donor and she is allowed to feel entitled to what she inherited. You are too close to the situation to understand her side. If you want a relationship with her, you owe her an apology. You are grieving, she is not. He wasn't there for her and had no relationship with her, she owed him nothing.", "YTA - The dad you had is not the dad she had.  If you tallied up how much he spent on you versus how much he spent on her, you would almost certainly come out ahead. You also come out ahead in 'dad time', which is way more valuable. She had no need to go to his funeral because he was, to all intents and purposes, not her dad. But she probably feels he owed her that money. And I would tend to agree.", "YTA \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your families loss. \n\nNow let\u2019s put yourself in her shoes.

He cheated on her Mum with mine and got pregnant with me maybe a year later. We moved to another city and he didn't have much contact with her after that. I saw her a handful of times as a child but moved near her for university and began having a proper relationship with her then. I moved back but still see her about twice a year. Our Dad hadn't seen her in about a decade when he passed.\n\nSo when he did pass this summer his house (which my Mum co-owened) and it's contents went to me and the money (savings and insurance) was split 50/50 between the two of us. The first payment was received earlier this month.\n\nI have absolutely zero issue with this arrangement but she didn't even attend the funeral. She didn't offer to help with the admin stuff. I did all of it on my own. On the day of the funeral she tagged herself and a bunch of friends at a restaurant. \n\nI get that my Dad let her down. He routinely bailed on plans, forgot birthdays etc but it just doesn't sit right with me that she took his money but didn't even show up to the funeral. \n\nI met her for lunch on Boxing Day and told her my feelings. That I thought it was disrespectful for her to take the cash but not offer to help me with any of the arrangements or even show up to the funeral. I wasn't angry and I didn't raise my voice. She did cry and left rather abruptly. That night she sent me a bunch of messages calling me unbelievably rude and that I'm an arsehole for making her feel bad for being mad at her for taking what she is owed.

They're a chance for the living to say goodbye and to grieve for the people they lost. She lost her dad a long time ago, and didn't feel any need to grieve for this man. If she wanted to be at the funeral, then that's perfectly within her rights, but if she didn't have any desire to be there, I can't blame her.  \nAccepting the money is a totally separate issue in my mind.

He wasn\u2019t a dad to her, he was already dead to her.  So you\u2019re upset with her for not checking in on you when your dad died.  That\u2019s understandable.  But if my dad was an AH with no contact with me for ten years, i wouldn\u2019t feel obligated to help with funeral costs and if he left me money, I\u2019d take it too.", "You didn't have a big sister. You had a biological fact that you attempted, briefly, to create a relationship with after many years of absence. Then you left again and relegated her to twice yearly. It feels incredibly callous and presumptuous to assume you've created a sisterly relationship with that tenuous exposure.", "Wow imagine wanting that your whole life from your father while he started a new family and never looked back.\n\nDo you see how hypocritical you\u2019re being? Once again, she is being asked to be the bigger person and be there for others. Maybe you should extend some grace to your sister. That was too big of an ask in this situation. You have a right to your feelings but she has a right to boundaries.", "You seem more upset that you were left alone to deal with things rather than her not showing up at the funeral. Honestly, I think that's at least a much more understandable set of feelings rather then expecting her to grieve/respect the man who broke up her family and basically tossed her in the garbage for your mother and you.\n\nMy suggestion is to give this whole situation some time and then see how you both feel. If you have a good relationship with her (you saw her on boxing day after all) then it might be more fair to say you felt overwhelmed with the arrangements and were missing having her there since you see her as your big sister. \n\nBut this needs to be about *your* relationship, not her relationship with your father (note I don't even really say *her father* here). She's absolutely right to have nothing but disparagement for him. You *still* got more in the inheritance, a house is not a small thing and everything in it is all the belongings.  \n\nAfter all this, you're **still** the one he was more there for.", "Did you tell her that?  Did you put in effort over the years to maintain a positive relationship with her?  Does she think of you as her little sister or a half sister she barely knows?", "That\u2019s how she felt every time your father neglected her.", "INFO - have you guys actually had a bonded, sisterly relationship through the years?", "Did you bother making sure she was okay?  We already know you made sure she wasn't supported.", "Its reasonable for you to be upset that you felt she wasn\u2019t there for you emotionally. \n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what you expressed. You projected your feelings about her not being there for you on her somehow \u201cdisrespecting your father\u201d when he doesn\u2019t deserve an ounce of her respect.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. And this feeling is completely legitimate and doesn\u2019t make you an AH. \n\nIt sounds like it wasn\u2019t really about her taking the money? And more that you needed emotional support? Please reach out to her, apologize, and explain what it is really about. That she is entitled to the money but you wanted family to lean on after losing both of your parents. \n\nPlease take it from someone who has a lot of weird family and child-parent estrangement in the family: your sister might not have been able to support you emotionally. Having a constant disappointment from a parent, estrangement etc is really complicated. She might feel resentful or pretend like she is over him but that\u2019s doubtful. My mom was LC and later NC with her father for decades. When he died it was really complicated for her. And her siblings are also mad that she gets inheritance (difference to you is they\u2019re really mad and want her out if their life). She\u2019ll probably have a lot of feelings to work through on her own and wouldn\u2019t be a good support. My mom alternated between grieving, gloating, don\u2019t-care, and feeling justified every few hours for weeks - she would\u2019ve been the last person to support anyone who was actively grieving her father. \n\nAgain, I feel so sorry for you. Look after yourself.", "Tell her that,  tell her it wasn't about the dad bit that you were grieving and needed her big sister. But you cannot expect her to help with arrangements or be at the funeral when he wasn't a dad to her. She can support you emotionally.", "This is Raging Asshole territory, honestly.", "And I'm sure she wanted a dad, you are old enough to know we don't always get what we want. Stop harrasing her.", "Did you ever check in on her when your dad was being a good dad to you and not her. \n\nThe money is basically all he can offer her. Of course she\u2019s going to take it and is entitled to it and more considering how he let her down. \n\nYTA", "He\u2019s had 1 and a half strokes, he doesn\u2019t even remember the abuse or why i hate him even though i told him. He thinks we have a good relationship.", "Op did indeed.", "That is correct\u2014I was on the fence with \u201csoftly\u201d: I had added it because OP doesn\u2019t seem to be thinking logically and may be driven by emotion/resentment [eta, resentment for not getting the help she feels \u201centitled\u201d to] since it is hard to take care of the end of life matters, not realizing that her expectations for her half-sister are beyond ridiculous.", "With an extra helping of guilt after she got it.", "then she is in the wrong for taking it.

Just saying OP is not the AH for voicing her feelings on the subject \n\nThings that would make OP the AH \n1. Trying to stop her sister from collecting (she didn\u2019t)\n2.

Stating her feelings on her sisters decision (she did)", "No, there were friends, neighbours, colleagues etc. His brother and family came but literally just for the day so couldn't help.  A lot did offer but I think in a way that we often do to the relatives of recently deceased. \n\nHonestly I am upset that my big sister wasn't there. Or check in. I really felt very alone.", "In a previous post, she has that she spoke to her mum about her children\u2019s custody situation so either she has some mad ouija board skills or OP has lied about something/everything.", "Ok so I probably should have made clear; she reached out to me when she learned that I was studying in her city. It was on her terms. I moved back for work and as such can't see her as often but we do text regularly. I didn't demote anyone. Neither of us have the time to travel to see eachother as often. She IS my big sister.\n\nRegardless, I accept the blame here for how I handled this situation. I have rectified it.", "Honestly, since it\u2019s specifically about the dad, that\u2019s really too much for op to ask for support for  from her sister.  She needs to get that support elsewhere.  She\u2019s asking her sister to set herself on fire to keep op warm.  It\u2019s not ok for her to ask for support in regards to her dad.  It\u2019s selfish, really selfish.", "I sincerely hope you get the money.  I cut my dad off and I knew he would disinherit me, but he went a step further and disinherited all the grandkids too.  If I\u2019d known that, I never would have gone to his funeral.  I thought I was being respectful by going because all the grandkids (not all of whom are mine) would be provided for as promised.  He didn\u2019t and I wish he had a grave just so I could piss on it.  He owed that money for all the abuse he put everyone through.  I wish I believe in hell so I could enjoy the thought of him being miserable in it.", "He takes after his dad like that.", "She should absolutely take the money. Due to the emotional trauma and Daddy issues she undoubtedly has from the abandonment, she's probably an impoverished single mom working as a stripper.", "She didn't just express her feelings, she made her sister cry and leave. You don't need a lot of empathy to know that expressing dissapointment on the girl who got nothing but money and DNA from that man might cause some serious pain. She probably had to grieve the fact that she did not have a father growing up and now, the sister who got it all is dissapointed she had to do everything. Expressing feelings is not always an innocent thing. If she wants to express her feelings without hurting someone, she should go to a therapist or a best friend.", "Because her \u201copinion\u201d is selfish af. She doesn\u2019t get to have an opinion about whether or not her sister is entitled to the money based on attending the funeral. It\u2019s her money by law.

She sat there and listened to YOU talk about what an incredible father he was.\n\nNot only is it okay that she didn\u2019t attend, but I think it could\u2019ve been actively harmful to her to attend. You\u2019re grieving, I know, but you can\u2019t put your grief ahead of hers. She\u2019s been grieving your father for a long time in a different way - have you been there for her through that in the same way you expect her to be there for you?", "She has felt very alone her entire life. You're being extremely unfair to her.", "I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how she felt every time he bailed on her. You are getting a small taste of a meal she was force fed her whole life.", "That\u2019s a valid feeling. You\u2019ve lost your other parent. Of course you felt alone. I think there is room for you to express your profound loneliness and grief to her without blaming her for choosing a path that is entirely justifiable given her circumstance.\n\nDid you check in with her and how she was doing?\n\nI do think you are too close to the situation and you owe her an apology.\n\nEdit: People, I get that OP did say a callous thing but OP is going through a very difficult time in their life. Both parents are gone now. Maybe help guide these two siblings back to a loving relationship rather than punching down? \n\nAlso, OP, I wanted to add that your sister may be grieving in a different way. Now that your father has died, any hopes or wishes she may have to reconcile and have a father has died along with him. There is a grieving that takes place with this. You guys have this great opportunity to lean on each other and tragedy can really help you build a stronger relationship if you let it.", "YTA - Your big sister wasn't there? You're kidding with this nonsense right? YOU are the kid SHE lost a father too. Get over yourself, call her, apologize if you ever want to see her again. And never mention that man to her again.

You're right.", "She didn\u2019t \u201cmake her sister cry\u201d if she did that I would agree with you. She expressed her self in a  (she states) non disrespectful way. Making her sister cry would make her the AH and would be invalidating her feelings or being disrespectful. Maybe it made OP cry that her sister didn\u2019t come to her dads funeral? That doesn\u2019t make the sister the AH.

Is this the OPs second account?", "Her entire post is about her sister not going to the funeral BUT taking the money. Did you miss that part or are you purposefully misinterpreting facts? Also your initial comments stated how \u201cshitty\u201d it is that she didn\u2019t help with the funeral but took the money. So maybe don\u2019t pick and choose what you\u2019re going after when everything is in text? The sister doesn\u2019t have a relationship with the father because he neglected and abandoned her. She doesn\u2019t have to do shit for his funeral and the OP has no right to call her rude for having valid feelings about her absent sperm donor. She is entitled to the money and the OP is clearly in the wrong and feeling too entitled to think she gets to judge her sister. She WAS disrespectful when she called her rude."]}
