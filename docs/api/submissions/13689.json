They\u2019re great though and we get along really well.\n\nJack and my dad seem to have a wall between them. Which isn\u2019t a huge deal considering it hasn\u2019t been very long.\n\nBut anyways, Jack posts a lot of himself on Instagram/tiktok. He goes to the gym and cares about his appearance and all that jazz so he gets a lot of attention. My dad\u2019s made some comments about it like \u201cdoesn\u2019t he seem a bit self centred\u201d or \u201chis ego must be through the roof\u201d things like that. \n\nIf Jack\u2019s taking pictures or something of himself or a girl approaches him while we\u2019re out, my dad will make faces. Oh if Jack wears a tank top that show off his muscles or is shirtless, dad\u2019ll tell him there\u2019s nothing to show and make similar \u201cjokes\u201d. He\u2019s very sneaky about it though and I only recently started noticing his behaviour and the aggression behind it.\n\nAnyways, we were on a road trip, and Jack and I were taking selfies. Jack jokingly put his hand on my face to cover me up. This is a joke, I\u2019ve done it to him before too. My dad saw though and he abruptly pulled over and grabbed Jack\u2019s phone from his hand. He then started yelling at him for treating me like that and told him to get off his fucking high horse because he\u2019s not that fucking special. \n\nJack\u2019s mom was PISSED and demanded he let her and Jack off. We were in a random ass town so dad tried to keep driving but she was not letting him and he ultimately dropped them off. My brother and I got off too. \n\nDad was so shocked that we did but he was especially upset with me because he did all that for me. He said that he knows I have low self esteem and he didn\u2019t want Jack to treat me like I was lesser than. He kept asking me to get back into the car, nicely, but I refused. He told me that I\u2019m going to regret this and that I broke his heart but I didn\u2019t budge and told him to stop acting like he did that for me, clearly, he did it for himself. That struck a nerve and he finally drove off.\n\nJack\u2019s uncle picked us all up and we actually had a great time exploring the place but I was also a bit guilty the whole time. Sure, my dad might\u2019ve had some personal feelings about the whole thing but it\u2019s true that he only lost it because of something Jack did to me. I do have self esteem issues (though Jack wasn\u2019t triggering me or anything). Maybe I\u2019m trying too hard to justify him but he did look heartbroken and maybe this whole thing is a misunderstanding between the two of us. Gosh, idk. He hasn\u2019t been answering my calls and my mom tells me that he\u2018s pretty hurt.", "created_utc": 1680310035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12860zz/aita_for_breaking_my_dads_heart_after_he_did/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No sweetie, your dad did NOT do that \"for you\". He picked an unnecessary fight with a teenage boy because *he* felt threatened, and you were absolutely right to call him on it when he tried to hide behind your skirts.\n\n>he only lost it because of something Jack did to me\n\nNo! He lost it because he has self-control and emotional regulation issues, even though he's an adult. Don't you dare take responsibility for your dad's feelings!\n\n>I do have self esteem issues\n\n...And I can't help wondering where you got them, honey.\n\nWho taught you to run around after your dad and clean up his messes? Who taught you that if your dad \"looks heartbroken\" after he royally messes up an interaction and four people don't wanna hang with him anymore, that it's YOUR job to make it better? And why is your mom, who *wasn't even there*, coming down on your dad's side and trying to guilt you out over it, especially since your dad is now giving you the silent treatment?? Has your mom always been the peacemaker and smoother-over? Does she think that's your job now?\n\nAnyway. Your dad sounds exhausting and immature, OP. I think his GF just figured him out.\n\nAnd you're hip to his tricks too, hon, so hold your ground, DO NOT APOLOGIZE, and wait this one out. Good for you for speaking your truth!", "Nta. Your father for whatever reason is threatened by Jack and acting on these unfounded feelings in a destructive way. When he's ready to talk I'd be honest and firm that what he did was wrong. You appreciate that he was looking out for you, but he over responded in a way that wasn't OK. He owes the whole car an apology.", "NTA. You're a hero. For whatever reason your dad is picking Jack to bully and it's a miracle he got busted before Jack's mom married him. It's especially concerning that he was being low down and sneaky about it. Offer to go to a counselor with all of them if they push it but don't back down- tell your dad he was being a bully and it was breaking your heart to see him like that", "NTA.\nHe was an asshole to Jack. You're not obligated to see him as your night in shining armor just because he did it allegedly for you.", "That wasn\u2019t in defense of you, that was his fragility showing. He needs to address what\u2019s going on within himself before he pushes everyone away\n\nNTA", "NTA. The only thing your dad was doing was being an insecure jerk. For some reason, your dad does not like Jack and is bullying him. He just used you for the excuse to let his insecurity out on Jack again. He needs to chill out and treat Jack respectfully. If he can't do it on his own he needs to get help from a professional and soon, before he drives away his daughter and his girlfriend, if he hasn't already lost her.", "You are not responsible for your dad\u2019s lack of control over his own feelings. HE overreacted and needs to apologize.\n\nNTA", "NTA-your dad jealous -maybe for his youth, maybe his girlfriend having a kid is a hang up, maybe the good relationship he has with you and your bro or you dad has crush on him. Whatever it may be it\u2019s all him, that reaction is not a protective response, it\u2019s a jealous response.", "NTA it's actually really gross that your dad is jealous of his date's child.", "NTA. It seems your dad really dislikes Jack and is being over protective of you. This is with good intentions I\u2019m sure but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being a very negative thing. You, your dad, Jacks mom and Jack need to sit down and really just work through this. Like it or not, if they continue to date your dad is gonna have to accept Jack. You can\u2019t be hostile towards your partners child. \n\nHe may be hurt by you choosing to go out with them but he\u2019s the one who instigated the issue and made a mountain out of a mole hill. You love your dad and your dad loves you. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a good person but he needs to cool his jets.
