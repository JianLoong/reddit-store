I\u2019ve lived here for a year and have always had my packages dropped off either at the front gate or hidden behind our mailbox near our front gate. But lately all my packages have been delivered to a post office bc the delivery driver determines it is not safe to leave it there. So I either end up having to pay to pick it up from the post office every time or I have to call to reschedule the delivery. \n\nSo again today they said they could not deliver my package and so I call UPS immediately and ask them to just leave at my gate whenever they are able to come back because I am here and will pick it up. UPS customer service gives me no problem and says they will make a note to drop it off the next day. \n\nThen I get random call from the UPS in my city and it is a lady yelling at me about how I don\u2019t have a door bell (I live in an in law unit) and how they never leave packages on main streets bc they can be stolen. I let her know that I\u2019ve lived here for a year and they have left packages where I requested and that I get notified when it is delivered so I come outside asap. She says \u201cI don\u2019t believe that bc we don\u2019t do that.\u201d And I said \u201cwell I\u2019ve lived here for a year and that\u2019s what has happened.\u201d She then starts saying \u201che is in the front now and you are not there, where are you?\u201d So I go outside and nobody is there. So I tell her that and she goes on about my door bell and I say \u201cmhm mhm\u201d and then she says \u201cwell do you want your package or not?\u201d And I say \u201cwhat kind of question is that?\u201d And she says she is trying to see where the delivery driver is. I\u2019m standing outside and I see him pull up while she\u2019s going off about the delivery lol and I say to her \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d She says her name. And I say \u201cwell, (name), he\u2019s here. And next time don\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d And I hang up. \n\nAITA for requesting this?? Like am I making it too difficult or is she just wrong? Like she could\u2019ve worked something out with me, maybe they didn\u2019t know that they could hide it behind my mailbox, and I get the job is stressful but when she said if I wanted my package or not I was like ok this is clearly not right. I got my package from the driver and he said she is the supervisor, so that makes me worried about future packages. So I contact UPS to complain bc I thought it was weird for her to call my number to yell instead of working something out. I did get upset when the delivery guy came I was like \u201cMichelle is a bitch.\u201d Lol. I should\u2019ve talked calmly to the driver but I was so upset.

She behaved as you called her. Was it a mature response? No. However if a service professional, supervisor or manager is making customer contact, they had best mind their manners.", "I don\u2019t think the way she spoke to you was great, from comments she got really irate, that\u2019s pretty odd from customer service at the end of the day why does your package matter to her so much \n\nbut I know quite a few people who think it\u2019s fine if a delivery service leaves their parcel like that they claim they didn\u2019t receive it (when they did) so it\u2019d not surprise me if they are tightening up on it and you need evidence of it given to a person or left in a super secure place", "NTA.

That was probably his wife or mom.", "YTA. Whatever the issue was prior calling her a bitch might have been due to different internal rules at the company changing, different policies, different management - you have no clue about that.

Now posibly its a new driver and he doesn\u2018t wan\u2019t to do that. If you don\u2019t have a ringbell, i  for one in his place would take your packet to a post office daily, it\u2019s your problem. Leaving the packet otside cuz you come out fast just won\u2019t do, if that packet dissapears by chance you call ups and want reimbursment, so the driver will pay cuz he responds for that packet.", "ESH, but she deserved it.\n\nIf you're asking if you were the AH, then you must feel at least a little guilt for saying it so I'll going to recognize that you were a little bit, but she sounds like she definitely deserved it.   \n\nMy guess is that she couldn't read and had you mixed up with another customer who was actually a pain.   That doesn't give her the right to talk to any customer that way.   \n\nSo Michelle is the AH, and your just were frustrated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But like u call a customer to yell at them how are they going to react? I called her a bitch bc she started getting loud when I was calm.

It\u2019s a service I\u2019m allowed to request and instead of working something out with me she started yelling. If she came at me calmer I would\u2019nt have called her a bitch bc I get it, but you\u2019re calling my personal phone number to yell.

It bothers me that they kept telling me the reason it isn\u2019t dropped off is bc I didn\u2019t sign the form or bc they weren\u2019t sure why.
