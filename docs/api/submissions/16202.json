Screw getting along, the import thing is that this never happens again.\n\nTL,DR - your neighbors have zero right to spray toxic substances on your property.

Maybe she\u2019s more concerned about the garden itself? \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH. It\u2019s unfortunate that the neighbor used a harsh insecticide next to a food garden, but she may not have even considered that it would affect the food down the line since it\u2019s so early on, and she may not have realized that what was being sprayed could be unsafe. She also wasn\u2019t doing the spraying, so she might not have known to begin with. But she should have apologized when it became an issue. OP did go too far.

If OP doesn\u2019t feel safe eating from that garden, that\u2019s their call, but I personally would read up on that chemical myself and take into account how much actually got on the garden.", "NTA, but obviously they\u2019re close enough to get sprayed. \n\nYour neighbor isn\u2019t going to change; you have to take precautions to be sure she can\u2019t poison you and your children.", "You are seriously invested in this, are you Op\u2019s alt account? \n\nWhen you do anything in your yard close to the property line you run the risk of, for lack of a better word, cross-contamination. OP is not wrong for being upset and neighbours should have told her they spray their garden so OP could have made a choice about where she planted.", "That's not what Keenzur is saying. They're saying OP did the equivalent of leaving your keys in the car when you live next to a car thief.", "I think you missed the part where no one can control the wind.", "Maybe N A H for the sentiment, E S H for the approach is the best way to consider it. Neighbor should feel the right to use their property as they see fit but give warnings for when pesticides will be sprayed right on the edges. OP should feel dismayed at pesticides in their produce, but face the music and move the plants to somewhere they'll be away from interference.", ">doctor\n\nNotice she didn't say what kind of doctor.\n\nShe could have taken it to her Chiropractor.", "I did not come here for judgment thank you very much. If I see a situation differently I am entitled to my opinion. You know that calling me an ah with your YTA comment added into the algorithm that you agree with me. So now I see you as a silly person who does not understand the rules with an opinion with a value near 0. Thank you for agreeing with me though you meant not to.", "Wind does that\u2026 it\u2019s how sprays work. You still do not get to dictate what your neighbours sprays unless there are regulations in place normally set by an hoa in America. I understand your concern, but her rights end where the neighbours rights start. And unless he was trying to spray her garden\u2026 which I did not get the sense to be true in a targeting sense.", "Two things are correct at the same time. \n\n1. Monsanto should not be allowed to lie about their product and need to own up to the mountains of legal ramications against them for over a decade.\n\n2. It is ill-informed and self sabotaging to try and grow organic produce, not in an isolated planter bed, in the same soil and proximity as your angry neighbor's hedgerow that does not require the same isolation treatment.", "She\u2019s been asked many times what they were and she hasn\u2019t responded. \n\nAs most gardeners know, overspray is well known and not uncommon whether it be by wind or too close etc. If I\u2019m already having disagreements with my neighbor about what I can plant, I certainly wouldn\u2019t plant my food garden anywhere near them. Even without the disagreements-again-overspray is always a thought when you make your vegetable gardens.", "Can't help myself, sorry - please be aware that \"Good fences make good neighbours\" is a quote from a poem by Robert Frost called Mending Wall, which is very much about challenging that idea, and instead about only building walls when we need them.\n\nIn this case, though, if the neighbour can't keep his toxic spray to himself, the proposed fence does indeed seem quite well-justified!", "Tell me you've never lived in a small town without telling me lol neighbors out in the suburbs and rural areas are **notorious** for sticking their nose into everything they can, because they're bored and have nothing better to do.\n\nIt's the reason I refuse to live in a place with an HOA - no matter what good can come of it, eventually the board is filled with ancient \"Mr. and Mrs. Kravitzes\" and they suck the joy out of everything, because the only enjoyment they get out of each week is making everyone miserable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was over a buddy's house with our kids a few weeks back and suddenly an older gentleman was wandering around the street outside. He walked up and down each driveway and a bit around the front yards of every house. I asked, naturally, what the hell a drifter was doing in the front yard. My buddy said he was the chairman of the HOA and he did this **every single morning** to look \"deficiencies\" in the neighborhood. He had a notepad that he'd write out each infraction in and then send out tickets for anything he disagreed-with. He also got the rules changed 5 times that year to account for new things he didn't like that he saw.", "this is obviously not a good example but folks tend to try to stick up for elderly neighbors against getting bullied or taken advantage of. in this case it's the elder in the wrong, but i could see people just blinding maintaining that status quo. regardless, OP is not the AH.\n\nhowever, it's really not a great idea to plant edible foods on property lines. i realize it's probably a smallish back yard, but you can't control everything that crosses over. thick privacy hedges would likely be better. \n\ni'm also confused about this pesticide that an apparent random person was spraying -- what country is this that that's even legal", "Fucking love this response. I personally would have added a fuck off but you've shown that it would be redundant.", "you can't say something like this, you have to hate someone.", "Wait, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m dumb \ud83d\ude05 is that bc it makes it more likely that something like this will happen?", "Gotta love how spraying toxic chemicals on other peoples property is apparently not the issue here.", "Care to explain how it is OPs fault that the neighbor isn't able to keep his activities to his property? Or do you not have arguments that go further than the ad hominem?", "As long as your mother approves of you speaking to other people like that all is fine.", "Then the neighbor shouldn't be expected to ask about treating their own plants in their own yard.", "People love to complain about the most mundane things. I\u2019ve lived near an airport, by train tracks, and in an apartment that overlooked a massive playground. Literally everything becomes background noise that you don\u2019t even notice after a week. Complaining about a single swing set in someone\u2019s back yard? JFC, people need to get a fuckin hobby.", "Man this is the real lesson here.  You already have disagreements with a neighbor that disapproves of how you use your property.      \n     \nDon't put anything on that side of the property unless you put up a privacy fence.", "This is where I'm at. Treatment gets into water -- water gets everywhere. If OP truly needs pristine produce that is untainted by neighbors, she needs to be planting in beds and not in the ground. As things sit, her ground-planted produce is being affected by far more than just her immediate two-feet away neighbor.", "Yeah, but she was pregnant when she just started making the bed-which she said took weeks. Then she said \u201ca couple weeks later\u201d \u201c I waddled outside to confront\u201d when her plants got some OVERSPRAY.", "I've only gotten 3-4 bits in the first year and the squirrels go to those before I could. Thanks for sharing.", "She also could have taken it to someone who had a PhD in English literature, but given she was actually concerned, I\u2019m going to make the far more reasonable assumption that she took it to someone whose professional knowledge was relevant.", "Thanks for the tip on the algorithm, I edited my.post to single you out. You may not have come here for judgement, but by applying a double standard you certainly opened yourself up to it. And to counter the one in your reply NTA.", "If wind does that, it is the neighbor\u2019s responsibility to spray on a still day, or set up a barrier while spraying.  If none of that is practicable, then you don\u2019t spray along the property edge.  They are the ones introducing the hazard, it is their responsibility to contain it to their own property.", "I think she assumed that, whatever their past disagreements, the neighbor was unlikely to take it so far as the negligent use of toxic chemicals impacting OP\u2019s food crops.  The neighbor also could have told OP that they spray that hedgerow so it might be safer to plant elsewhere.  \n\nBasically, if you\u2019re creating the hazard, containing it is your problem.", "Cool story, the neighbours still deliberately sprayed a dangerous chemical on food they knew a pregnant woman was going to eat, tried to stop her finding out it had happened, and then refused to tell her what it was for an extended period. They knew what they were doing was unreasonable or they wouldn\u2019t have tried to conceal it.", "I love that poem! But you're right, I did somewhat bastardise the original meaning to make my point, didn't I? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd while we're on Robert Frost, I think After Apple-Picking is one of my favourite poems of all time.", "A fence of any height would not help against aerosols and toxic insecticide. And a spray that makes produce unpalatable for a *year*? Holy moly! Is that even legal for private use?", "The saying existed before the poem, which is why Frost had it to write about. Sometimes, good fences do make good neighbours by protecting boundaries so we don\u2019t have to be regularly restating them.", "I was not taking this bait. Some people here just HAVE to fight. Even for a simple little garden post.", "Nah, you can just say that, like here:\n\nPlanting a garden along the property edge wasn't the best idea.", "If you tie up your dog next to your neighbor's outdoor food bowl, don't get pissy when they eat the neighbor's food. OP planted essentially a row of edible hedges next to their neighbor's non-edible ones and is now mad they're in range of pesticides sprayed on one side. \nThat'll happen to plants that are next to eachother.", "Dang, youre just determined to be angry about this arent ya?", "What do you mean? Spraying toxic chemicals is *absolutely* the issue here, which is why planting food crops away from the shitty neighbor is a good idea. \n\nWould you rather be right and secretly poisoned, or plant the berries elsewhere and not be poisoned?", "At this point just post your own judgment with your own points. You keep trying to bait people into arguments and its not working.", "OP can be right AND it can be a bad idea to have the garden so close to the neighbor\u2019s property. No one is saying it\u2019s OP\u2019s fault.", "No I don\u2019t really care to explain something I never said", "She would probably say the same thing, your a complete idiot and more than 100 people think so too, in no way was he saying the neighbour was the victim, she was, but she probably should\u2019ve thought twice before planting vegetables next to that neighbour. There\u2019s such a thing called contingency planning.", "I grew up in the suburbs and now currently live in a high rise just off one of the major streets in a major metropolitan city, and also right next to an elementary school. Being on the higher floors means there's nothing to dampen the noise. \n\nI fuckin love it here. \n\nI've come to the conclusion that there's so LITTLE to do in suburbia that people just start to come up with their own shit to stir.", "Even a fence isn't going to change the fact that these plants are next to eachother. If you douse one plant with pesticides and then water it, the soil literally right next to it also has pesticides in it now. OP is angry and that's fine, but they're misplacing it and also shooting themselves in the foot trying to grow organic produce without really understanding what affects plants growing.", "I agree. Not to mention that berries (raspberry and blackberry for sure) send out runners and there is a good chance those berry bushes could end up strangling out the neighbors hedge in a few years.", "Don\u2019t worry, I still value your opinion for what it seems to be worth. I am open to criticism of my arguments all the way. But if you want to shout ah at each other until we tire i will bow out of that conversation before it begins. If you attack my argument I will respond with civility, if you attack me then it seems like you do not know how this works and I will show you. We attack the arguments here not the people. Please and thank you.", "I agree with you to an extent, I think the burden of care here is not absolute but to a reasonable point. So on a reasonably still day there is some allowable crossing, not sure exactly what, but the expectation to be entirely clear from it is not as reasonable lie as spraying common pesticides in one\u2019s own backyard. So in principle a agree, with a reasonable limitation. As the neighbour spraying is a very common act, the reasonableness expectation has been met imho. Though of course all subjective standards are imperfect. Spaying pesticides is normal, and generally allowable. I won\u2019t go so far as to call the op a hypochondriac, but it does seem like her expectations and requirements vis a vis food growing may be extra special due to her dietary needs, none of that creates any extra obligation to the neighbour.", "It definitely makes this situation ESH. Both sides are being stubborn idiots only harming themselves, because the neighbor is gearing up to have whatever complaints OP submits now hanging over their head, and OP has a garden full of inedible plants she's now too stubborn to move or admit should have been planted elsewhere.", "Well, if that\u2019s what you want to believe based in OPS story, which, BTW, nowhere they said they deliberately sprayed on their food. You can\u2019t begin to plant and created a garden bed and \u201ca couple of weeks later\u201d have food growing.", "Ahh, After Apple Picking is great too! I always liked Out, Out a lot, as an edgy teen a decade ago - but so much of Frost's writing has that melancholy to it. \n\nAnyway, sorry for being a nuisance :) It is a pet peeve of mine with this particular poem", "One of my personal favourites is The Road Not Taken. After Apple Picking is also a favourite too!", "Unless it's leaching into the soil a solid fence probably would help. If the exposure path is up 6 feet over and down 6feet the pesticide will barely make it.", "Lmao and they\u2019re still doubling down \ud83d\ude02", "I know right. I don't mind an occasional good stoush but c'mon, pick your battles.", "I mean, you are the one throwing around moronic arguments, so there's that.", "Can't have an argument without arguments, that part you did understand. The next step would be to keep that to yourself, but you will get there.", "I tend to view spraying being normal the same way I view smoking being normal - it\u2019s legal and generally not considered offensive when it only affects you, but it\u2019s also widely known that it\u2019s bad for you, and deliberately exposing others to it is at the least pretty obnoxious.  To continue the analogy, sure you\u2019re going to smell it if your neighbor is smoking in their yard, which is unpleasant, but within the realm of what must be tolerated.  However, if they\u2019re leaving cigarette butts in your yard or leaning over the fence while they smoke, they\u2019re out of line.\n\nSo, I would say that the minute amount of spray that might drift on a still day, along with what\u2019s unfortunately probably also leeching into her soil, is under present law / social convention a thing that must be tolerated (I personally hope that changes as regards pesticides, but for now, it\u2019s just tough luck that she got neighbors who spray, just like if she had neighbors who smoke).  \n\nBut if she could see the spray drift from her window?  That\u2019s not a minute amount.  That\u2019s probably the recommended dosage, actually, not the dousing the neighbor was giving his bushes.  Neighbor is therefore being negligent and encroaching on her property rights.", "Out, Out is such a good but horrifying poem. It was one that my mom kept reading and going, and I was an adult before I realized that her connection to the poem was probably strongly influenced by my oldest brother\u2019s death on the farm (tractor, not hungry buzzsaw related).", "If a farmer uses Monsanto seed and the wind carries the seed to a neighboring farm, the neighboring farm sues Monsanto and cannot harvest their crops.", "Tripling even, now with incivility!", "Are you okay? You need a hug or something?", "I think I\u2019ll let the karma speak for itself here instead.", "That\u2019s just a matter of scope. In my estimation, the op is over estimating and the neighbour is underestimating. But if we are just going to argue over degrees, then I find your position eminently reasonable, and I think in essence we are in agreement, with only a slight perspective change. And for the record, you could easily be 100% right."]}
