Many people are able to garden without depending on their neighbors to regulate the health of their plants or what nutrients they receive.

Screw getting along, the import thing is that this never happens again.\n\nTL,DR - your neighbors have zero right to spray toxic substances on your property.

Maybe she\u2019s more concerned about the garden itself? \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH. It\u2019s unfortunate that the neighbor used a harsh insecticide next to a food garden, but she may not have even considered that it would affect the food down the line since it\u2019s so early on, and she may not have realized that what was being sprayed could be unsafe. She also wasn\u2019t doing the spraying, so she might not have known to begin with. But she should have apologized when it became an issue. OP did go too far.

I will be polite and smile or wave and if someone knocked for an egg I would give them one. I don't know their names or hang out at the fence and catch up. I don't invite them over for dinner. We don't speak. I stay on my property and live my life and they do theirs. I bought this so I can be left tf alone and I would certainly never go and knock on their door to exchange numbers or something lol", "This would\u2019ve been my thought as well.

Us has pretty lax pesticide laws compared to others and particularly Germany.", "And it\u2019s great that you did that.  Not sure you\u2019d have been as forthcoming if one of them had come storming out of the house yelling at you before you even got the chance though.

I have a property so I can have my own space to do with as I choose and considering how hard it is to get property in this day and age, I will 100% be not taking anyone else's view into consideration, just as I would expect them to not take mine into consideration. My across the street neighbour just took down a line of 100 year old fir trees totally eliminating the view of the forest and any privacy between my properties view and theirs.
