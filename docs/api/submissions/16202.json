Screw getting along, the import thing is that this never happens again.\n\nTL,DR - your neighbors have zero right to spray toxic substances on your property.

Maybe she\u2019s more concerned about the garden itself? \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH. It\u2019s unfortunate that the neighbor used a harsh insecticide next to a food garden, but she may not have even considered that it would affect the food down the line since it\u2019s so early on, and she may not have realized that what was being sprayed could be unsafe. She also wasn\u2019t doing the spraying, so she might not have known to begin with. But she should have apologized when it became an issue. OP did go too far.
