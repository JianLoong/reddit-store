{"id": 25100, "submission_id": "15wd4ap", "title": "AITA for laughing at my SILs complaints that her grandchild will be named after me?", "selftext": "My niece through my husband, Ava, is 19 and announced her pregnancy not too long ago. She privately approached me away from everyone else and asked if I would be good with her naming her daughter after me. I was honored and told her as much but also said she didn't need to if she would rather pick a new name for her child. She said I had a profound impact on her life and she felt like I would be the best person to name her child after. I told her I was so touched and she was super happy.\n\nShe told her parents (SIL and her husband) about the pregnancy and then the rest of the family. Then a week ago she told everyone she was naming her daughter after me.\n\nSIL was immediately unhappy about this. She told Ava that the baby deserved a better, more classic name than mine and wouldn't she rather name her after a grandmother or late family member over me. Ava said there was nobody she could think of as more deserving for the honor.\n\nNow I should probably mention that I met Ava when she was 13. She was going through a very hard time at school and with her friends and I helped support her. A year later she confessed to having some medical issues as well and I was there for her through that as well. I also had some experience thanks to a family member. We really bonded and she credits me for getting her through that period and all of high school. SIL is not the most understanding or supportive person in the world so Ava felt like I was her savior in a way.\n\nIn the days that followed Ava's announcement, SIL was up in arms about her grandchild being named after me. She also had some commentary to make on the name itself. Eventually, on Friday, she brought it up to my husband and myself and I laughed at her complaints. My husband held it in but he was both rolling his eyes and trying not to laugh. SIL asked what I found so funny and accused me of trying to make her granddaughter's life harder and that I manipulated her daughter into naming her baby after me. She also insulted my name some more and told me I was behaving improperly with my reaction. My husband thinks she was ridiculous but she is genuinely pissed and has told the rest of the family that I was the bitch who laughed in her face.\n\nAITA?\n\nMy name is Starr btw.", "created_utc": 1692542353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wd4ap/aita_for_laughing_at_my_sils_complaints_that_her/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think she is just offended that her daughter would rather name her child with a great-aunt's name rather than her actual grandmother, but didn't want to say as much, which was probably why she threw in the \"naming after a deceased family member\" part. Whatever qualms she has about the name needs to be taken up with her daughter not you. Of course anyone would laugh at how ridiculous her campaign is.", "NTA It's Ava's choice. SIL is jealous of your relationship and acting very inappropriately.", "Wow!  What a great name.   Did your niece tell your SIL why she wanted to name her baby after you?   And yes it is ridiculous that she is so upset about something that is going to be so beautiful in her life.   \n\nI had a MIL who literally said she hated our daughters names before they were born.   She basically said I need to name one of them the name she loved.  I told her no, these were what their name are going to be, she needed to find a way to make peace with it.  \n\nYour SIL sounds self centered and the fact that her daughter was going through all that and she didn\u2019t help her through that, that\u2019s pretty traumatic stuff.     She needs a check.  I think her daughter is giving it to her.   Not saying she\u2019s a bad mom, but it does sound like maybe she minimized her daughters feelings and didn\u2019t help her cope with it.  \n\nGood luck.  Stand your ground, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA.  I'm not particularly fond of the name, either (sorry), but it's certainly not awful, like SIL is claiming.  As another commenter said, there are far \"worse\" names she could choose (Reighfyl, anyone?).  Regardless, the only opinions that matter are Ava's and her SO's, and they can name the baby whatever they want.", "NTA. \n\nStarr is a good name. It's not like your niece is naming the kid Khaleesi or something stupid. The pain your SIL is inflicting upon herself by being petty about it is not your problem.", "NTA \n\nEven if you don\u2019t include everything else about how Ava feels about you, it\u2019s her baby. She can give them whatever name she wants.", "Laughing at SIL probably threw some fuel on the fire, but NTA.   Your niece entitled to name her child as she pleases and your SIL needs to get a grip.  This sounds like she\u2019s jealous that the baby isn\u2019t being named after her", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour SIL is crazy, she needs some professional help. That niece of yours hasthe right to call her daughter whatever she well damn pleases.", "NTA. SIL probably sees the naming as underscoring the fact that she hasn't been great as a mother and someone had to step in and basically do her work for her. I get why that stings. But she could also have chosen any other reaction than one that confirms that implication tenfold. Laughing at her obvs only escalates a conflict which in her slightly(?) narcissistic mind is deadly serious - but I probably couldn't have helped it in the moment either, so I can hardly fault ya. \n\nI also doubt she's unhappy about getting to play the victim over being 'mocked'. I think any reaction you could have given other than \"omg you're right I'll pressure Ava into bending over backwards for you immediately\" would have been met with the exact same reaction of telling everyone how horrible you were to her. You couldn't have done the right thing without pissing her off.\n\nAlso let's not forget she was making some pretty serious unfounded accusations and verbally attacking you to your face. Laughing is a pretty generous reaction to that.", "NTA\n\nYou SIL is jealous. She\u2019s deflecting with her saying things about your name, but that all boils down to jealousy.\n\nI\u2019d laugh at her ranting too.", "NTA and I love the name!! Sister in law is just extremely jealous and she\u2019ll get over it or maybe she won\u2019t and that\u2019s ok!!!", "Obviously NTA, it wasn't your suggestion, the new mum has made her choice and as long her and the dad are happy its noones business. I understand jealousy, but showing it in such a nasty way is very pathetic move from the grandmother.", "NTA. And Star is an adorable name! I will never understand why people choose the most basic, boring names when you can name your children literally anything! Now I\u2019m not saying name your kid \u201cBlanket\u201d or something, but it\u2019s like people use zero creativity when coming up with a name. I would just let her be mad. It\u2019s ridiculous to be mad over what someone else wants to name their own child.", "Nta. Ava can do what she wants", "NTA.\n\nIgnore the drama queen.", "NTA.", "Cool name.
