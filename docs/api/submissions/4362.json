I honestly don't know why. I love my wife (who stands up for me with MIL), am a good father (at least I try to be), and try to be nice to my in-laws. My wife's family is fantastic, except for the strained relationship with MIL. \n\nMy mom pointed out at a birthday that MIL won't even look at her or return a hello. From that point on, at the following events, I pay close attention to this. And at several birthdays, dinners, or kids' games, MIL actively ignores my mom, which upsets my mom, but at least I have her back and nicely say something to break the ice, so they exchange a hello. My two boys (12-10) have noticed and even asked me why MIL is so mean to Nanna.\n\nWe had another birthday dinner at a nice restaurant with all the local family. My mom arrived early with my family, and we welcomed everyone as they arrived. In comes MIL, who ignores both my and my mom's hellos. She did hear us. My mom tried again with nothing. My mom got up and walked over to MIL's seat (touched her shoulder!!), and my MIL looked further the other way. Mom looks at me with a defeated look of disbelief. I was now mad. Mom sat as the family started to take their seats. My mom tried six times to say hello; yes, I was counting, and my oldest son whispered as much in my ear. \n\nAfter that last attempt, I was fighting mad and intervened. I was not polite, and loud enough to overshadow all of the other conversations at the large table, I aggressively said, \"MIL, WOULD YOU ANSWER MOM AND SAY HELLO? YOU ARE BEING EXTREMELY MEAN!\" I don't think I screamed, but SIL said I did. I was loud and shocked everyone at the table. This outburst is very unusual behavior for me. MIL and FIL stayed but obviously, it was awkward for the entire table. My wife said MIL needed to be called out. But BIL and SIL told me that I was entirely out of line for embarrassing their mom, and I am a complete AH. Later my mom told me that was embarrassing and unnecessary. I told them that I am done putting up with her and will not take any shit from this point forward.\n\nSo, AITA for yelling at my MIL at a family dinner?", "created_utc": 1670611606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh57sj/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mil_in_a_restaurant_at_a/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then discuss if she can behave like a decent adult. If not, she doesn\u2019t need to be invited anymore.", "NTA. Your mom is being a classic mom and not wanting a fuss to be made.

Quite frankly, it seems like your mother is the one causing the scene by saying hello 6 times and then physically touching someone who clearly wants nothing to do with her.", "NTA, and you're right.

You and your wife should have told your MIL from day one that if she wants to be included in family gatherings, she needs to at least be polite to your mom. Your outburst was too little too late and I can see why your mom was embarrassed. I also have an issue with your mom\u2019s repeated attempts to engage your MIL. She knows that your MIL doesn\u2019t like her so why is she continuing to engage with her? Saying hello to the same person six times is five times too many.

I'm convinced that most people who behave like your mother in law do it so they can have the upper hand. People with attitudes like that often end up being catered to, treated with special consideration, etc because no one wants to upset them more and because people want that person to like them. The only good defense against that is to quit trying and totally ignore them.", "ESH.  MIL is an AH.  But knowing the history of MIL/Mom why would you expect MIL to behave any differently at this dinner?   Knowing what was likely to happen you should have known that a family dinner with MIL/Mom together was not a good idea.

My wife and I will continue to invite both you and my Mom to joint events with the expectation that you can be civil and not blatantly ignore her.
