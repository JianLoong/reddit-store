She usually eats everything.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife was traveling for work and I had a family emergency back in my home country so suddenly we needed someone to look after our daughter Chloe for about a week, and my wife's brother Owen (30M) volunteered and saved the day.\n\nOwen is a foodie and to be fair makes delicious food but he's also quite picky and maybe a bit judgemental of food that isn't done properly or isn't fancy enough. This isn't usually an issue though.\n\nLooks like during this time Chloe and Owen had the time of their lives because my daughter was quite happy in the end, and well, we learned about the surprises later on. Apparently Owen fed her some really fancy food and kind of changed her perspective about a lot of the food we typically eat.\n\nI learned this the hard way, when Chloe asked for a grilled cheese and then didn't eat what I made her (typical American style which she always liked), wanted it the way her uncle Owen made it. I called Owen for the recipe but goodness me, I had to buy like 10 new ingredients, several types of cheese, a kind of bread that I don't have or can't make, make fresh Bechamel sauce or whatever it's called, etc... like I don't have time to do any of these and they are expensive. I did give this a try and my daughter did say it was nice but not as good as he uncle Owen's.\n\nThis keeps on happening now. Pretty much everything me or my wife make, or when we order Pizza, she says this is not good and wants it the way Owen does it. We then call Owen for the recipe and everything is complex, expensive, needs equipment we don't have and time consuming.\n\nOwen hosted Christmas dinner and Chloe asked to go there early to help her uncle and well, the day after that said that is how we should make food!\n\nIn my kind of frustration I called Owen and told him he kind of made our lives a lot more difficult. We never had trouble with food before and now it's the number one issue. He suggested that maybe we can expand our horizons and it's good for Chloe too to experience a wider range of food choices instead of complaining to her person who gives good food to Chloe.\n\nMy wife agrees that it's a lot more difficult now but says it was kind of an asshole thing to complain to Owen when he was doing us a favor and he hasn't done anything except give Chloe good and healthy food. From my perspective it was just not necessary for a 9 year old to turn into Gordon Ramsay and make our lives a lot more complicated.", "created_utc": 1703956684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ukht6/aita_for_complaining_to_my_brother_in_law_for/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most importantly involve Chloe in the cooking process. If she wants fancy dinners she can learn to make them herself, she\u2019s 9.

I don't think your daughter's new opinions come only from her having tried new food during a week.\n\nAnd you, for handling it wrong and letting your daughter reject all that food that she used to enjoy, teaching her a terrible lesson about being able to get every whim like an entitled princess. Owen taught her to disrespect those who don't meet his fancy standards and it seems you've been reinforcing that.", "YTA\n\nHe did you a favor and now you\u2019re blaming him for opening her to new food experiences. How about you explain your lifestyle differences.

He gave Chloe treats when she stayed with him. I may want expensive gourmet meals, but I\u2019m not going to get them because they\u2019re too expensive and time-consuming to make regularly.

Ever thought of telling your daughter \u201cno\u201d when she wants things her own/Owen\u2019s way in your house?  I personally wouldn\u2019t be running out spending huge money on specialty cheeses to placate a child. I\u2019d explain that eating at home is different than at Owen\u2019s and prepare her good, nutritious food without the fuss. She\u2019s 9. It\u2019s great that she had fun with a foodie relative but I wouldn\u2019t twist myself into knots to serve her gourmet grilled cheese. It\u2019s a want, not a need and you need to teach her the difference between the two. YTA.", "Your daughter did not become a picky eater.

But you're wrong to take it out on Owen. You could have explained your daughter that his food is for special occasions. Or everyone's food taste different but it's still tasty. You could even involve her in cooking.", "YTA here. It's normal for kids to want whichever food they had at a friend's or relative. It's great that your daughter has been exposed to new foods. Maybe she can cook some of Owen's recipes with you? You don't have to change your way of cooking. It's okay to have different styles of cooking.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t seem that Owen set out to make your daughter dislike her regular food. It\u2019s just something that happened when she was exposed to different food. And he was doing you a favour. You can\u2019t expect him to change his own eating habits when he is looking after your child. \nIt\u2019s kind of amazing Chloe wants to go over early and help him cook dinner! That is a relationship that should be nurtured. She can learn a lot from him and develop her interest in food. \nStill - I understand your frustration! You are busy and don\u2019t have the time or desire to cook the kind of food Owen cooks. You can explain this to your daughter. She\u2019s old enough to understand. You can work with her to find some things she likes but that are easier to make than what Owen makes. \nIf you encourage her interest, soon enough she\u2019ll be cooking gourmet meals for you!", "YTA! The smart thing to do is say \u201cWell honey, it\u2019s important that food is tasty but we have to eat healthy food and make sure we don\u2019t waste money so we can afford nice things like at Christmas!

Your frustration is completely understandable. But you have to remember that even though he may have inadvertently caused you this inconvicence he still did you a massive favour when you needed him most.", "YTA though it's understandable frustrating that Chloe is rejecting everything you make and comparing/wanting Uncle Owens. But he isn't an Ahole for giving her food the way he normally makes it (unless he's been disparaging your food but doesn't sound like it.) Everyone does food differently, your daughter will encounter lots of good from different people, I'm sure you've got some favourite eateries you can't replicate at home.\n\nWhile Owen has a slight point about expanding horizons, you shouldn't be forced to change your entire way of cooking things. Chloe does need to learn she can't always have food like Owens.\n\nI think it would be good idea for her to be more involved in cooking, to see how much time and effort goes into cooking. I love cooking but sometimes you want to take the easy option. Sometimes I make a lovely curry or pizza from scratch, sometimes I buy a takeaway. \n\nYou need to get over your resentment of Owen, get Chole more involved and also help her understand your way of doing things isn't wrong. Did you enjoy any of Owens recipes? Why not save some for special occasions, you might find that more enjoyable.", "YTA.

Better yet: check your local community college for a parent/child cooking class for you to do together.

Stop blaming him for your failure to parent.", "YTA. Owen just cooked and your daughter is being a normal kid. You're going about this all wrong. First, your child is 9. Why are you working so hard to meet her every demand for fancy food? She'll be fine if you never make bechamel sauce.

He's done nothing wrong and did you a massive favour.\n\nThen shift your thinking with your daughter. Fussy eating usually means thinking normal foods are gross or developing issues with food touching etc. Your daughter is just developing a refined palate and passion for food which is very cool and the opposite of picky.\n\nYour daughter is old enough to listen if you explain that it's fantastic that she's enjoying new foods and flavours, but it's not a sustainable way to eat every meal. If you can, take her to the library to borrow some cook books and let her pick 1 recipe a week she wants to try and then cook it together. Uncle Owen could be a big help with this if all is forgiven.\n\nI'm not trying to tell you how to raise your kid, it's just so great to hear about a kid wanting more than chips or nuggets!

You can't afford all the ingredients for Owens style cooking? Absolutely fine, and completely understandable. But Owen didn't do anything other than let his niece explore other foods, or same foods made differently. \n\nThis should have been a conversation between you and your daughter about how fancy food is not always going to be on the menu, and appreciating what is made for her regardless of who made it or how it was made is good manners. \n\nIt does just sound like a phase she will soon outgrow so don't worry too much, but Owen wasn't wrong here.", "ESH. Don't blame Owen, he was having a good time with your daughter and exposing her to new foods. \n\nYour problem is Chloe, who is old enough to understand that different households run differently. When she is with Uncle Owen, they can have the fancy food that Owen likes to make, and has the time and finances to make. When she is home, she has to eat the food that her mom and dad make. Don't make it a competition. Suggest that if she wants the fancy stuff, then she can learn how to make it from Uncle Owen and cook it for herself. Maybe you have an aspiring chef.", "YTA your daughter is expressing an interest in cooking, you should encourage that. Maybe she'll discover a new love, maybe not, but she'll appreciate the effort that goes into cooking", "YTA. Owen helped you in an emergency, and you repay him by complaining that he *checks notes* makes good food? \n\nKids are going to go through annoying phases and find things to complain about. As kids are exposed to more of the world they will start testing boundaries because that is what kids do and how they learn. It's your responsibility to navigate as a parent. \n\nYou could also potentially turn this into something positive and fun. Let your daughter pick a recipie once a week and prepare it together.", "Is there a grilled cheese recipe tax for this post?", "YTA. Have you tried having your daughter help with food preparation so she can see how much more difficult this is? Or taking her along for grocery shopping? Or even discussing what a budget is and cost differences? I don't mean writing a spreadsheet with all your income and expenses, but basic stuff about how much food costs. She is old enough to know that resources aren't limitless . Did you do literally anything other than call a family member and complain the help they offered for free isn't good enough for you? Ugh.", "YTA. \n\nWhat I\u2019m reading from this is that you are frustrated because your daughter doesn\u2019t want your convenience foods now that she\u2019s had quality homemade stuff. \n\nI get that it can be frustrating if you and your wife both have busy schedules and/or lack the funds to make foods the way Owen does, but to call him to complain and call your daughter \u201cpicky\u201d because she wants better tasting food is over the top. \n\nBetter options would be: explain to your daughter that she gets different foods in different households, or, have Chloe start learning how to cook for herself.", "Gentle YTA. Totally understand why this would be annoying but it\u2019s your job to manage your daughter\u2019s expectations now and understand that the extravagant cooking is something she does with her uncle. Sounds like this may be a hobby for her and a great activity she can share with her uncle, she just needs to understand it\u2019s not a daily activity in your house. Maybe let her plan a meal once a week, go to the grocery store with you to pick the ingredients, and lead the cooking? She\u2019ll have some foodie experience to look forward to and you\u2019re not shutting down her new interest completely.", "I was wondering this too, perhaps their cooking sucks and uncle introduced her to a whole new world of flavor.", "This is such good advice.  My kids often want certain, fancy things and if it seems over the top, I ask them if they want it enough to pay out if their allowance.  I'm often surprised at their choices!", "I like the rich friend\u2019s house analogy! When we are exposed to things we might want them but it\u2019s not always possible to have them. Enjoy it when you have it and let it go!", "Yep. Story time. I have 6 kids, and we strive to eat a wide variety of meals. I have one \u201cpicky\u201d eater who has some sensory issues, but the rule with him is that if he doesn\u2019t like what we are eating, he can make himself a PB&J or microwave a meat pie or bake a frozen pizza. My husband LOVES hot food. Like, goes his own ghost peppers and Carolina reapers hot food. He\u2019s got my second son eating hot stuff too. But I am a mild heat person, as are most of the other kids, so our meals, while flavorful, aren\u2019t spicy. \n\nMy son decided he wanted hot food. So he learned to cook. He\u2019s 16 now and could open a ramen restaurant. He makes the most amazing stir fry. And his hobby is learning new recipes.\n\nIf OP\u2019s daughter wants fancy food, 9yo is old enough to start learning to make fancy food. She might need supervision, but it\u2019s going to pay dividends in the future to get her comfortable in the kitchen!", ">The real reason you are mad is that you don\u2019t want to put in the effort of changing your routine, and you don\u2019t know how to express that to your daughter without coming off as lazy or mean\n\nI don't think I would go as far as to say \"lazy\" if they don't have the finances or time to make everything gourmet. \nA grilled cheese with multiple kinds of cheese, from scratch gravy and what else was in it, is more than just extra effort. \nThat can end up pricy. \n\nI wouldn't be buying tons of extra special kitchen stuff either that is used for one single dish. \n\nWhat they should do is have a talk with her, yes. \nWhat Uncle Cooks can be fun meals. Its a special thing for them.\nBut she can't expect to do fine dining everywhere she goes. \nAnd then look into how to make food a bit more fun at home, within reasonable budgets.", "Agreed. My cousins love to eat out in any of my family's households (my parents', my sisters' in England or mine), even if it was only some pasta or sandwiches. When  we are at their house, their parents make awful food, sometimes barely cooked or leftovers that were not very well cared for. No wonder they like to eat anywhere else, even the simplest of foods!", "This is the best reply. Listen to this OP.", "Just here to say that I appreciate your writing \"palate\" rather than \"pallet\" or \"palette\"! Sincerely yours, a fussy crank who should probably go outside.", "This", "My (43F) neice (12) visited when we bought our house because we finally had a kitchen and I just made food that I usually make.  She has no allergies and will eat whatever.  Through no fault of our own, she raved about the food me and my husband made.  \n\nMy sister now has my neice like a sous-chef assisting her in the kitchen and she loves it.  The last time they visited my neice made us home made spaghetti and meatballs with marinara (apparently a recipe from The Bear).  It was absolutely delicious.\n\nOP should maybe ask for suggestions.  It's a lot harder to complain when you helped make something.", "How is Owen an asshole?"]}
