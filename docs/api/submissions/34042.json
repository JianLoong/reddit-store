She usually eats everything.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife was traveling for work and I had a family emergency back in my home country so suddenly we needed someone to look after our daughter Chloe for about a week, and my wife's brother Owen (30M) volunteered and saved the day.\n\nOwen is a foodie and to be fair makes delicious food but he's also quite picky and maybe a bit judgemental of food that isn't done properly or isn't fancy enough. This isn't usually an issue though.\n\nLooks like during this time Chloe and Owen had the time of their lives because my daughter was quite happy in the end, and well, we learned about the surprises later on. Apparently Owen fed her some really fancy food and kind of changed her perspective about a lot of the food we typically eat.\n\nI learned this the hard way, when Chloe asked for a grilled cheese and then didn't eat what I made her (typical American style which she always liked), wanted it the way her uncle Owen made it. I called Owen for the recipe but goodness me, I had to buy like 10 new ingredients, several types of cheese, a kind of bread that I don't have or can't make, make fresh Bechamel sauce or whatever it's called, etc... like I don't have time to do any of these and they are expensive. I did give this a try and my daughter did say it was nice but not as good as he uncle Owen's.\n\nThis keeps on happening now. Pretty much everything me or my wife make, or when we order Pizza, she says this is not good and wants it the way Owen does it. We then call Owen for the recipe and everything is complex, expensive, needs equipment we don't have and time consuming.\n\nOwen hosted Christmas dinner and Chloe asked to go there early to help her uncle and well, the day after that said that is how we should make food!\n\nIn my kind of frustration I called Owen and told him he kind of made our lives a lot more difficult. We never had trouble with food before and now it's the number one issue. He suggested that maybe we can expand our horizons and it's good for Chloe too to experience a wider range of food choices instead of complaining to her person who gives good food to Chloe.\n\nMy wife agrees that it's a lot more difficult now but says it was kind of an asshole thing to complain to Owen when he was doing us a favor and he hasn't done anything except give Chloe good and healthy food. From my perspective it was just not necessary for a 9 year old to turn into Gordon Ramsay and make our lives a lot more complicated.", "created_utc": 1703956684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ukht6/aita_for_complaining_to_my_brother_in_law_for/", "score": 1116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think your daughter's new opinions come only from her having tried new food during a week.\n\nAnd you, for handling it wrong and letting your daughter reject all that food that she used to enjoy, teaching her a terrible lesson about being able to get every whim like an entitled princess. Owen taught her to disrespect those who don't meet his fancy standards and it seems you've been reinforcing that.", "YTA\n\nHe did you a favor and now you\u2019re blaming him for opening her to new food experiences. How about you explain your lifestyle differences.

He gave Chloe treats when she stayed with him. I may want expensive gourmet meals, but I\u2019m not going to get them because they\u2019re too expensive and time-consuming to make regularly.

Ever thought of telling your daughter \u201cno\u201d when she wants things her own/Owen\u2019s way in your house?  I personally wouldn\u2019t be running out spending huge money on specialty cheeses to placate a child. I\u2019d explain that eating at home is different than at Owen\u2019s and prepare her good, nutritious food without the fuss. She\u2019s 9. It\u2019s great that she had fun with a foodie relative but I wouldn\u2019t twist myself into knots to serve her gourmet grilled cheese. It\u2019s a want, not a need and you need to teach her the difference between the two. YTA.", "Your daughter did not become a picky eater.

But you're wrong to take it out on Owen. You could have explained your daughter that his food is for special occasions. Or everyone's food taste different but it's still tasty. You could even involve her in cooking.", "YTA here. It's normal for kids to want whichever food they had at a friend's or relative. It's great that your daughter has been exposed to new foods. Maybe she can cook some of Owen's recipes with you? You don't have to change your way of cooking. It's okay to have different styles of cooking.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t seem that Owen set out to make your daughter dislike her regular food. It\u2019s just something that happened when she was exposed to different food. And he was doing you a favour.

That is a relationship that should be nurtured. She can learn a lot from him and develop her interest in food. \nStill - I understand your frustration! You are busy and don\u2019t have the time or desire to cook the kind of food Owen cooks. You can explain this to your daughter. She\u2019s old enough to understand. You can work with her to find some things she likes but that are easier to make than what Owen makes. \nIf you encourage her interest, soon enough she\u2019ll be cooking gourmet meals for you!", "YTA! The smart thing to do is say \u201cWell honey, it\u2019s important that food is tasty but we have to eat healthy food and make sure we don\u2019t waste money so we can afford nice things like at Christmas!

Your frustration is completely understandable. But you have to remember that even though he may have inadvertently caused you this inconvicence he still did you a massive favour when you needed him most.", "YTA though it's understandable frustrating that Chloe is rejecting everything you make and comparing/wanting Uncle Owens. But he isn't an Ahole for giving her food the way he normally makes it (unless he's been disparaging your food but doesn't sound like it.) Everyone does food differently, your daughter will encounter lots of good from different people, I'm sure you've got some favourite eateries you can't replicate at home.\n\nWhile Owen has a slight point about expanding horizons, you shouldn't be forced to change your entire way of cooking things. Chloe does need to learn she can't always have food like Owens.\n\nI think it would be good idea for her to be more involved in cooking, to see how much time and effort goes into cooking. I love cooking but sometimes you want to take the easy option. Sometimes I make a lovely curry or pizza from scratch, sometimes I buy a takeaway. \n\nYou need to get over your resentment of Owen, get Chole more involved and also help her understand your way of doing things isn't wrong. Did you enjoy any of Owens recipes? Why not save some for special occasions, you might find that more enjoyable.", "YTA.

Better yet: check your local community college for a parent/child cooking class for you to do together.

Stop blaming him for your failure to parent.", "YTA. Owen just cooked and your daughter is being a normal kid. You're going about this all wrong. First, your child is 9. Why are you working so hard to meet her every demand for fancy food? She'll be fine if you never make bechamel sauce.

He's done nothing wrong and did you a massive favour.\n\nThen shift your thinking with your daughter. Fussy eating usually means thinking normal foods are gross or developing issues with food touching etc. Your daughter is just developing a refined palate and passion for food which is very cool and the opposite of picky.\n\nYour daughter is old enough to listen if you explain that it's fantastic that she's enjoying new foods and flavours, but it's not a sustainable way to eat every meal. If you can, take her to the library to borrow some cook books and let her pick 1 recipe a week she wants to try and then cook it together. Uncle Owen could be a big help with this if all is forgiven.\n\nI'm not trying to tell you how to raise your kid, it's just so great to hear about a kid wanting more than chips or nuggets!
