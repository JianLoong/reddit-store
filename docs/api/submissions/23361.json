My family wasn\u2019t destitute, but my mom has always had an issue with spending money on nice things. At Christmas one year, all I wanted was a Bath and Body Works set. She got me one from Walmart instead. She told me that I didn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d B&BW, this was just as good. I expressed gratitude and used it all up to make sure she knew I appreciated it. \n\nBut inside, I was so disappointed, because the lotions and smells just weren\u2019t the same. The same happened with a nice purse. I wanted a department store one so badly because of how beautiful it was, how sturdy it was. She got me one from Target and told me that it was good enough and how stupid it was to spend so much money on a purse.\n\nWhen I left home, I promised myself that at least once a year, I would budget to buy one nice thing. Clothes, shoes, fragrances, whatever. I keep an ongoing list of the nice things I like, not quite a registry or anything, just like an organized list with links and reasons I want.\n\nMy husband wanted to get me something for our anniversary (3 years!) and he checked with my mom because I talk to her almost daily. She said that she had the perfect idea for me because we\u2019d talked about fragrances lately.\n\nI have wanted a bottle of Baccarat Rouge 540 SO badly. It was what I was planning on spending my money on this year. It is expensive, but oh my it smells so lovely.\n\nWell I guess my mom took it on herself to get me a bunch of \u201cdupes\u201d of the fragrances on my list instead. They are from companies that advertise heavily on social media. \n\nTo say that I was disappointed was an understatement. I of course accepted the package gracefully and have worn each one for him to appreciate. But when he told me that my mom had facilitated this, I had enough.\r\n\nI called her out and told her that I wanted the specific fragrance I\u2019d listed for a reason. That dupes can be fun to try, but they are not the same! And especially not the ones she had gotten me. They smelled cheap and artificial, and the bottles were ugly and plain. I told her that she always make me feel so bad for wanting to treat myself to nice things.\r\n\nShe bit back telling me that she had no idea how she raised a daughter to be as money grubbing and wasteful. That for the cost of one bottle of the fragrance I\u2019d wanted, she got me at least 5 full bottles of perfectly good fragrance. I told her to please never do this again, and then said I would make sure my husband understood as well.\r  \n\r  \nShe told me that I was ungrateful, spoiled, entitled, and that she didn\u2019t raise me to be such a snob.\n\nAm I really the asshole?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1690570950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c62ra/aita_for_calling_out_my_mom_after_she_got_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It probably just up to the individual but to me its tacky and just not right. \n\n\nI suggest telling your partner to not take gift advice from your mother, he should know enough about you to get you a suitable gift.", "NTA - Your mother can give you any gift she wants.  That is up to her. but you do need to tell your husband how you feel.  He probably does not understand the background on this.", "NTA!  There is nothing wrong with saving for one luxury item a year!  Your mom sounds awful,  I\u2019m so sorry!  Communicate clearly with your husband so that he gets something off from your luxury list next time.  Tell him to please never go to your mom for any ideas again.   Forgive your mom when you can but let her know your boundaries too.  Gifts should be something to look forward to and make you feel special,  not getting you what you don\u2019t want for a fraction of the price.", "NTA for not liking it. I\u2019m not sure what purpose it served to talk to her though. You were better off speaking directly to your husband and explaining that your mom has a history of deliberately picking gifts based on price rather than what you want and she isn\u2019t someone whose advice he should follow.", "NTA\n\nOh people who give people presents they clearly don't want and be mad when they don't like it\n\nWell if she don't want to spend her money on that things is ok so she buys something else\n\nYou buy your things with your money and she says you are spoiled?\n\nShe is just forcing her views on you and ignoring you are your on person", "NTA! Your mom can be cheap with her gifts and for herself of course. She should not be implementing her frugality onto your husband though. He should've just asked you what you wanted and got it. You aren't spoiled or entitled for wanting nice things. Buying yourself one luxury item per year is so not being ungrateful. Your mom should stay out of your and your husband's business and she can continue to be cheap for herself. You do what makes you happy. NTA at all.", "There are very few things as frustrating as getting almost what you want.

Especially in your marriage.  Have a talk with your husband so he gets it and doesn\u2019t listen to your mom going forward.", "INFO: Why would you share a list of gifts you desire with your mom? She historically does not support your choices, demeans your interests and just proved it again? Additionally, your post suggests you never shared your frustration about your mom re: gift giving with your husband.", "NTA. your mom's reaction of saying she didn't raise you to be a snob makes me think the issue is actually her being incredibly judgmental. there's nothing wrong with spending money on nice things. \n\nbut a lot of people turn their noses up at the idea of luxury clothing brands, perfume, makeup, etc. they think they're superior to people who buy designer handbags because \"who would ever waste their money on something so superficial?\"\n\nand unfortunately, you won't be able to change their minds. she did this specifically because she judges women who buy themselves nice things, and she thinks if you do that, it's a reflection on her.\n\nout of curiosity, was it oakcha or dossier?", "NTA.\n\nYour  mom is the asshole for disregarding your wishes.\n\nYou should communicate openly with your mom about her feelings and explain the importance of respecting your choices....", "NTA, you are not money grubbing and wasteful, cheap alcohol based fragrance doesn\u2019t smell like good quality fragrance, and even if it didn\u2019t the scent could be off as many dupes are. Also you\u2019re allowed to even just want it to own a nice pretty expensive thing for yourself and just to know you own the real thing. If you have a wishlist people need to stick to exactly that, and just not get that thing if they\u2019re trying to find other versions. You aren\u2019t a snob, I think we just take things moms say to heart, but ignore her. Explain to your husband next time though that you would really appreciate owning the real thing.\n\nBut side note - IF you DO want an actually good dupe till your next gift giving holiday, I did a lot of research on finding a dupe for my bff because we have gift spending limits but she loves BR540, and I found what I believe is an undetectable dupe from a lady on Etsy. I am 100% gate-keeping the link so send me a dm if you want. Of course you might have a great nose and find it off, but I have a pretty excellent one, and can\u2019t tell even when she and I take strolls through Neiman\u2019s and smell the original. It\u2019s also cheap enough to just try and give away if you don\u2019t like IMO. It is only an oil-rollerball though, I don\u2019t think the seller makes sprays unfortunately. Or if they do, I can\u2019t vouch for them.", "NTA. Your mom sounds vile.", "NTA. But you should explain this habit of your mother\u2019s to your husband so he doesn\u2019t ask for her help again.", "If you want a specific perfume, buy it yourself. You can\u2019t dictate exactly what people are expected to buy for you. But there\u2019s nothing stopping you from getting it for yourself. In the future, don\u2019t discuss material objects with your mother. And if she asks for suggestions about getting you something tell you that you\u2019d like cash or a gift card. Then you buy what you want. Maybe your \u201clove language\u201d is \u201cgifts\u201d, which has always been the hardest one for me to understand (as far as receiving, that is). But, even then, I simply don\u2019t understand love or validation ever coming from the cost of a gift. Again, as an adult, you have the luxury of treating yourself.", "YTA.  If you care so much, you smile and graciously accept someone's gift and then you go buy yourself the expensive item yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's about showing that you put the time to consider their wants and needs.", "She DOES treat to herself to these things.

And before someone comments \"It's the thought that counts\": sure, but the thought should be about the person receiving the present. So if you buy something you know the other person doesn't like (not clear if OP ever had the conversation with her mother before, so I'm not gonna include judgement) you obviously didn't think about them.\n\nIt's absolutely fine if someone doesn't want/can't gift something expensive. But you can always ask for a wish within a certain price range or just gift money or a giftcard to the store that, in OPs case, sells the perfume and pay for a part of the wish."]}
