I\u2019d rather just hang out and have no gift then something that has nothing to do with me or my interests. Accepting a thoughtful gift is one thing, someone giving you a thoughtless gift, is a whole other thing.\n\nPerfume smells a very specific way. It\u2019s made with herbs and spices and flowers and all of those things react to our specific body chemistry and make us feel a certain way and make our partners feel a certain way. It is a very personal choice. Real high quality perfume enhances your scent not artificially covers it. Cheap perfumes oxidize quickly and are usually alcohol based, they are loud and obnoxious smelling to begin and then degrade and dissipate quickly and you have to use more. \n\nAlso one fun thing you might want to check is if you\u2019re a super taster\u2026.there are three different types of tasters, so if you are a super taster it means your sense of smell is about 30% better than normal and 60% better than non tasters. This is commonly seen in people who think cilantro tastes soapy. Bitter foods like grapefruit and dark chocolate taste super bitter to you. \n\nIf your mom is a non taster and you\u2019re a super taster she literally might not smell any difference. But this is beside the point. \n\nIt\u2019s rude to ask what someone wants as a gift and instead of it or a gift card to the store they can buy it then get some knockoff of it. And then to tell you husband that more knockoffs would be better than the actual thing you want that would have cost the same money. You would rather have quality than quantity. Also what your mother fails to realize is that buying the actual high quality product will last usually twice as long because you only need a few drops. A little goes a loooooonnnnnngggggg way with perfume. \n\nHigh quality items last a long time, they also show you a value for your money, and if you decide to sell the item in the future it retains value better than a knock off. Also I would never choose to carry a knock off pair of shoes or bag because i buy things for looks not labels and most knock offs are of brands I don\u2019t like the atheistic of. \n\nHope you allow your husband to have an explanation and here\u2019s a link to my fav smelling perfume to check out next time you make a department store trip.\n\nhttps://www.macys.com/shop/product/ralph-lauren-beyond-romance-eau-de-parfum-fragrance-collection?ID=9792712\n\n***edit: here\u2019s a link to a high end perfume distributor that has small sample sizes of high end perfumes.
