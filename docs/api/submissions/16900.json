He put another task on her plate, trying to keep the whole group together except for your son who is talking to his brother even for if only a moment.  \n\nThis could spin out of control pretty fast because what about the other 7yo who saw his sister.... then the other one who saw is cousin, the one who saw their bff's older brother.... \n\nShe was right, it was a disruption and his attitude wasn't helpful, he wasn't saying \"do it, I'll give you his number\" to be helpful, he was being a smart ass and undermining her in front of her class. \n\nStuff like this is why teachers are quitting.  They're expected to act like Mary Poppin's all the time but aren't respected and backed up.  I can see why their developing bad attitudes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
