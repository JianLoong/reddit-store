He was my next door neighbour, and offered to help me put together flat pack furniture. We really hit it off, and have been together ever since.\n\nWill was married right out of high school to someone who was not a very good match. They were young, dumb, and made a colossal mistake. Will recognises now how crazy it was to marry someone at 18, but at the time, they really thought it was a good idea. That being said, the breakup and the fallout was terrible. This was before I met Will, but it sounds like both sides were out to inflict as much pain as possible. Fortunately there were no children or assets, but it was not a smooth process by any means.\n\nWill reached out to his ex-wife relatively recently (about two years ago) to apologise for all the pain he put her through, which I thought was quite nice of him to do. She also apologised for her actions, but both agreed that they did not want to stay in contact. However, coming out of that, Will told me that he has realised he never wants to get married again. This was a surprise to me, but I have never really wanted the white picket fence, so no marriage didn't really bother me. I am happy just to be in a long-term, committed relationship.\n\nRecently, it was my birthday and we had some people over for a BBQ. It was really lovely, but Will insisted we do presents in front of everyone. I haven't ever really done that, but I didn't have any issues with it. Everyone gifted me really sweet and thoughtful items, and it was a blast, until I got to Will's gift. Will had been really bragging about how this was the perfect gift and I had to save the best for last... It was a diamond tipped drill set. To be clear, I do not own a drill and have no interest in anything related to drills.\n\nMy face fell, and Will burst out laughing saying that that the joke is that these diamonds are the only diamonds I could ever expect to receive from him. \"Get it, because we aren't ever getting engaged?\" I was so humiliated! I excused myself and went into the house, and I suppose that everyone left after a while.\n\nWill tried to then give me my \"real\" present later that evening because \"the drill bits were only meant as a joke\", but I didn't even open it because I couldn't understand why he was so cruel in front of all my friends! Will says that I am overreacting when I have another gift and I agreed that we wouldn't get married. I feel really hurt and Will doesn't seem to get it, am I overreacting?", "created_utc": 1679388372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xb9pr/aita_for_my_reaction_to_my_birthday_present/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That isn't even funny. \n\nThat also would've worked a lot better with other jewelry.. Ya know, like a necklace or a bracelet.

That's awkward, rude, and cruel. You have every right to be pissed. If he's a great guy this could be a hard learning experience to grow from, but if you were unsure about a future with him I'd be over his shit. \n\nI'm curious if literally anyone but him thought this was funny. Does he normally have a warped sense of humor?", "He could have literally said almost anything else and not have been quite as distasteful. \"Just cuz we're not getting married doesn't mean I won't give you the world\"  \"these may be the only diamonds shared between us but we still will build a world together\"\n\nBut no. He chose to be hurtful and distasteful, and if it's not bad enough on it's own? He insisted to do it in front of everyone else. My vomit tastes better than his \"jokes\"\n\nSerious relationship or not, he needs a good doze of manners slapped in his face. You should either A.

Its just bullying.", "Making a joke like that could possibly be ok in private between you two depending on the dynamic, but stuff like that shouldn't involve your friends or family. You were definitely entitled to feel upset about it, and he needs to learn some tact. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nReally awkward joke, especially in front of friends. What even was the \"punchline\"? How was it meant to be funny?", "NTA\n\nGag gifts are only funny if the person getting the gift thinks it's funny. Not only that, his \"joke gift\" has to be the least funny/cool gift I've ever heard of. Especially when you add that nonsense he said. I've always been one of those people that gets embarrassed FOR people in awkward situations.... I would have grabbed my stuff and gotten the hell out of there if I witnessed that.", "NTA\n\nI don't think he really meant to embarrass you, but that's what happened, and you have every right to feel embarrassed because his joke fell super flat regardless.", "NTA - distasteful and hurtful \"joke\". You are not overracting and he needs to apologise.", "Oof, NTA. That's the kind of thing you pull and let the awkward silence set in for a moment before dropping to one knee in front of everyone you know and giving a really heartfelt proposal. This dudes just a dick.", "NTA. Belittling and very immature. A real dick move. Hahaha, I don\u2019t want to marry you, here\u2019s a symbolic gift of my lack of respect for you. I\u2019d reevaluate your relationship and your worth to this guy.", "NTA. How in the world would he think that that\u2019s even remotely appropriate? Girl, he\u2019s clearly not serious about you. Find someone who is.", "NTA because that is a cruel thing to do but I think you do want to get married and that's why you found that cruel/humiliating. If he thought you were fully on the same page as him in terms of no marriage then he probably thought you'd find it somewhat funny. I personally wouldn't care if a SO bought me a drill as a joke gift, it's not particularly funny but at least you have a drill now. Open your other gift.", "NTA - Jokes should be funny.", "What a fucking weird thing to do. \nThat joke might have been slightly funny in private.. and I mean might. Not in public though. \nVery weird. \nMaybe he\u2019s excited that you agreed as it might be a huge pressure off him or something but you\u2019re NTA for feeling humiliated by a humiliating act.", "omg that was so hurtful.\n\nIt is fine not to want marriage but he went out of his way to drive home to your friends he wouldn't marry you. To make sure they knew....to humiliate you.\n\nNTA\n\nHe is a total AH, more worrying... it could have been a mistake but instead if realising and saying sorry, he is doubling down and defending it. It doesn't surprise me that his ex wants nothing to do with him...he is cruel and malicious.", "He's an asshole. NTA. Even if he had done this as a \"gag\" gift just with the two of you, it would be insensitive. Deliberately setting this up as a big production in front of friends is cruel, and almost unforgivable.", "NTA.  You could have used inappropriate or bad judgement to describe Will\u2019s joke but you used cruel.  Cruel is a very strong emotional charged word.  There is a reason this hurt you so much and you owe it to yourself to explore why.  \n\nYou need to take time to seriously reflect on if never marrying is really what you want.  Take Will out of the thought process as having someone specific in mind muddies the water as there are emotions attached to him.\n\nLook into your future and see yourself unmarried at 65.  Are you OK never having married?  What about children?  How do you feel about not having any or having them while unmarried?  If you are ok with never marrying that\u2019s absolutely fine.  But if you find that you do want to get married then this was the cue that this relationship has sadly run its course.\n\nMy only advice is be true to yourself as the longest relationship you\u2019ll ever have is with yourself so do what\u2019s right for you.", "NTA. A joke is funny. This was definitely a lapse in judgment on his part. He is definitely old enough to understand why doing this particular diamond-related slam would be absolutely unacceptable under most circumstances. \n\nPersonally, I find this kind of \u201chumor\u201d simply a way to insult and demean people and then \u201claugh it off,\u201d something I made very clear to my (now) husband early on. If someone feels badly afterwards, it\u2019s not funny in my book. That said, I\u2019m aware not everyone agrees with that, and often friends have a sort of roasting humor with each other that everyone is ok with. Although I always wonder if EVERYONE is really ok with it. \n\nIf Will has a history of this kind of \u201cjust kidding\u201d kind of jokes, has OP previously reacted/told him it was not funny to her? Is this the first such offense?\n\nPeople often show you exactly who they are. It\u2019s best, IMO, to believe them.", "NTA\n\nThe present by itself was mean, doing it publicly was meaner, laughing in the moment was meanest and insisting he\u2019s right and you\u2019re overreacting is meanerest.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your boyfriend\u2019s an AH.", "It wasn\u2019t a joke, it was a childish prank in which only he intended to come out of this looking good. If Will needs to embarrass you to feel good about himself, maybe it\u2019s time to reevaluate the relationship.", "Hi Will,\n\nPlease explain the 'joke' aspect of this joke that humiliated your partner in front of friends. How, exactly, was this funny?\n\nDo you know what 'joke' means?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nEveryone xx\n\nPS OP is NTA.", "NTA \n\nThat might explain why he had to date an 18 year old when he was at least in his mid to late 20\u2019s and also might explain one of the reasons the relationship didn\u2019t work. \n\nYou need to take the rose coloured glasses off and ask yourself if this is really the type of guy you want to date. From what you\u2019ve said about him here I know my answer to that question personally... but only you can really make that call.\n\nAlso you don\u2019t mention anything about your relationship. Are you two even dating or are you still friends?", "Uhhhh\u2026, I\u2019m actually not sure how I want to go about this. \n\nOn one hand, I thought \u201cno marriage\u201d *didn\u2019t* bother you. Maybe you subconsciously wanted to get married. \n\nOn the other hand, your SO saying they\u2019re NOT gonna marry someone on your birthday DOES kinda hurt. \n\nIdk if I wanna say you\u2019re wrong, he\u2019s wrong, everyone\u2019s wrong, or no one\u2019s wrong. \n\nI say give him a chance and open his last present.", "NAH.
