He was my next door neighbour, and offered to help me put together flat pack furniture. We really hit it off, and have been together ever since.\n\nWill was married right out of high school to someone who was not a very good match. They were young, dumb, and made a colossal mistake. Will recognises now how crazy it was to marry someone at 18, but at the time, they really thought it was a good idea. That being said, the breakup and the fallout was terrible. This was before I met Will, but it sounds like both sides were out to inflict as much pain as possible. Fortunately there were no children or assets, but it was not a smooth process by any means.\n\nWill reached out to his ex-wife relatively recently (about two years ago) to apologise for all the pain he put her through, which I thought was quite nice of him to do. She also apologised for her actions, but both agreed that they did not want to stay in contact. However, coming out of that, Will told me that he has realised he never wants to get married again. This was a surprise to me, but I have never really wanted the white picket fence, so no marriage didn't really bother me. I am happy just to be in a long-term, committed relationship.\n\nRecently, it was my birthday and we had some people over for a BBQ. It was really lovely, but Will insisted we do presents in front of everyone. I haven't ever really done that, but I didn't have any issues with it. Everyone gifted me really sweet and thoughtful items, and it was a blast, until I got to Will's gift. Will had been really bragging about how this was the perfect gift and I had to save the best for last... It was a diamond tipped drill set. To be clear, I do not own a drill and have no interest in anything related to drills.\n\nMy face fell, and Will burst out laughing saying that that the joke is that these diamonds are the only diamonds I could ever expect to receive from him. \"Get it, because we aren't ever getting engaged?\" I was so humiliated! I excused myself and went into the house, and I suppose that everyone left after a while.\n\nWill tried to then give me my \"real\" present later that evening because \"the drill bits were only meant as a joke\", but I didn't even open it because I couldn't understand why he was so cruel in front of all my friends! Will says that I am overreacting when I have another gift and I agreed that we wouldn't get married. I feel really hurt and Will doesn't seem to get it, am I overreacting?", "created_utc": 1679388372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xb9pr/aita_for_my_reaction_to_my_birthday_present/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's awkward, rude, and cruel. You have every right to be pissed. If he's a great guy this could be a hard learning experience to grow from, but if you were unsure about a future with him I'd be over his shit. \n\nI'm curious if literally anyone but him thought this was funny.

I would have grabbed my stuff and gotten the hell out of there if I witnessed that.", "NTA\n\nI don't think he really meant to embarrass you, but that's what happened, and you have every right to feel embarrassed because his joke fell super flat regardless.", "NTA - distasteful and hurtful \"joke\". You are not overracting and he needs to apologise.", "Oof, NTA. That's the kind of thing you pull and let the awkward silence set in for a moment before dropping to one knee in front of everyone you know and giving a really heartfelt proposal. This dudes just a dick.", "NTA. Belittling and very immature. A real dick move. Hahaha, I don\u2019t want to marry you, here\u2019s a symbolic gift of my lack of respect for you.

Find someone who is.", "NTA because that is a cruel thing to do but I think you do want to get married and that's why you found that cruel/humiliating.

I personally wouldn't care if a SO bought me a drill as a joke gift, it's not particularly funny but at least you have a drill now. Open your other gift.", "NTA - Jokes should be funny.", "What a fucking weird thing to do. \nThat joke might have been slightly funny in private.. and I mean might.

To make sure they knew....to humiliate you.\n\nNTA\n\nHe is a total AH, more worrying... it could have been a mistake but instead if realising and saying sorry, he is doubling down and defending it. It doesn't surprise me that his ex wants nothing to do with him...he is cruel and malicious.", "He's an asshole. NTA. Even if he had done this as a \"gag\" gift just with the two of you, it would be insensitive. Deliberately setting this up as a big production in front of friends is cruel, and almost unforgivable.", "NTA.  You could have used inappropriate or bad judgement to describe Will\u2019s joke but you used cruel.  Cruel is a very strong emotional charged word.  There is a reason this hurt you so much and you owe it to yourself to explore why.  \n\nYou need to take time to seriously reflect on if never marrying is really what you want.  Take Will out of the thought process as having someone specific in mind muddies the water as there are emotions attached to him.\n\nLook into your future and see yourself unmarried at 65.  Are you OK never having married?  What about children?  How do you feel about not having any or having them while unmarried?  If you are ok with never marrying that\u2019s absolutely fine.  But if you find that you do want to get married then this was the cue that this relationship has sadly run its course.\n\nMy only advice is be true to yourself as the longest relationship you\u2019ll ever have is with yourself so do what\u2019s right for you.", "NTA. A joke is funny. This was definitely a lapse in judgment on his part. He is definitely old enough to understand why doing this particular diamond-related slam would be absolutely unacceptable under most circumstances. \n\nPersonally, I find this kind of \u201chumor\u201d simply a way to insult and demean people and then \u201claugh it off,\u201d something I made very clear to my (now) husband early on. If someone feels badly afterwards, it\u2019s not funny in my book. That said, I\u2019m aware not everyone agrees with that, and often friends have a sort of roasting humor with each other that everyone is ok with. Although I always wonder if EVERYONE is really ok with it. \n\nIf Will has a history of this kind of \u201cjust kidding\u201d kind of jokes, has OP previously reacted/told him it was not funny to her? Is this the first such offense?\n\nPeople often show you exactly who they are. It\u2019s best, IMO, to believe them.", "NTA\n\nThe present by itself was mean, doing it publicly was meaner, laughing in the moment was meanest and insisting he\u2019s right and you\u2019re overreacting is meanerest.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your boyfriend\u2019s an AH.", "It wasn\u2019t a joke, it was a childish prank in which only he intended to come out of this looking good. If Will needs to embarrass you to feel good about himself, maybe it\u2019s time to reevaluate the relationship.", "Hi Will,\n\nPlease explain the 'joke' aspect of this joke that humiliated your partner in front of friends. How, exactly, was this funny?\n\nDo you know what 'joke' means?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nEveryone xx\n\nPS OP is NTA.", "NTA \n\nThat might explain why he had to date an 18 year old when he was at least in his mid to late 20\u2019s and also might explain one of the reasons the relationship didn\u2019t work. \n\nYou need to take the rose coloured glasses off and ask yourself if this is really the type of guy you want to date. From what you\u2019ve said about him here I know my answer to that question personally... but only you can really make that call.\n\nAlso you don\u2019t mention anything about your relationship.

He hasnt changed all that much, the traits are still there.", "You're NTA. That was a rude, immature, and deliberately humilating stunt he pulled in front of friends. It smells of the type of power play an adolescent minded guy will do to impress his buddies.", "NTA. That is downright humiliating. Do you actually not want to get married or have you just agreed because you want to be with him regardless? This can turn into resentment fairly quickly.", "Nta.\n\nI can say he is a noob. The correct way is to diss/joke privately, but praise publicly.", "NTA. What he did was incredibly mean and unnecessary. It's not even a real joke if the point is to purposely humiliate you and announce to others that you'll never get engaged. You have every right to be upset, even if he got you a \"real\" present and gave it to you later (after everyone has already left). It might be a good idea to sit down and think about his behavior over the course of your relationship. This likely isn't the first time he's behaved in an unnecessarily mean way, even if it is the first time he's made you the target (which I highly doubt is the first real time). It's also important to think about the long term. Will has shown that he'll be mean to you as a \"joke\" and be dismissive of your feelings afterward. Marriage or no marriage, that's unacceptable behavior in a healthy long term relationship", "Dude sounds like my ex. My ex was an AH. Seriously he took your birthday and made it about him being \"unmarriable\" and he thought it was funny to be cruel to your in front of your friends. Fuck that guy you're NTA at all.", "NTA. You might have agreed that your relationship was more important than the idea of being married, but that doesn't mean you agreed to have your desire for marriage made fun of.\n\n\"These are the only diamonds you'll ever get from me\" is not a joke but a dig. And all the more so given that plenty of people in unmarried relationships buy jewellery for their partners.\n\nIn other words, you prioritised your relationship ahead of your own preferences for marriage, because you care for him and his feelings. He prioritised publicly voicing his distaste for marriage and denigrating your feelings, over showing how much he cares for you because...?", "I don't know what the heck that was but it certainly wasn't a joke. NTA", "NTA that was really hurtful and WTH can\u2019t he get you actual diamonds if you don\u2019t plan to get married. I have lots of friends who are married and SO get them jewelry as gifts.", "NTA. Seems like Will is still a cruel person that hurts people. I guess the only bright side is that you can expect an apology 10+ years later for this incident.", "NTA he purposely tried to make a spectacle out of you in front of your friends on your birthday. That's really shitty. Jokes like that aren't really jokes they're disguised cruelty. Jokes are meant to make you laugh not make you feel shitty. I can't see how his joke was meant to be funny at all tbh and I'm trying.\n\nYou deserve better than a boyfriend who enjoys making you feel shitty on your birthday.", "Will\u2019s a jerk\n\nNTA", "NTA. He made a fool of you at your birthday party. He is definitely not a catch, tbh.", "NTA, and honestly I feel like this relationship has run its course. You don't come back from cruelty like that very easily. Resentment is already easing in because of the cruelty of the \"joke\"", "NTA. Was this the first time in your six years together that he has done something this colossally stupid? If so, you can write it off as a brain fart on his part, but let him know how it made you feel. If stupid jokes like this are the norm, you may want to think about what your future will hold.", "NTA - what if you got him a gift that said 'He would never be a father' like a voucher for a free Vasectomy and then said 'Ohh its only a joke - after all, we agreed no children!'\n\nYou don't necessarily want to get married or have children but its something many people want and laughing about how its something you could do but you're choosing not to do it with him!\n\nPeople change their minds - look at George Clooney the famous 'I'm never getting married again' movie star.  You could easily change you mind and get a lovely emerald ring from a lovely man.", "NTA even remotely. I never understood the whole \"give people a gift that's going to make them sad/upset and laugh at their expense before giving them their real gift\" thing. My family used to do this to kids at Xmas by giving them a big box and they'd get all excited about opening it, only for it to be coal so the kids would be crying before they'd bring out the actual gift. It's not cool and it sounds like Will needs to work through some issues. Just because he had a bad first marriage doesn't mean a subsequent one would be the same thing and punishing you because he mad bad decisions in the past is cruel.", "NTA. That was cruel and unnecessary on so many levels.", "Nta,\n\nI get why he got divorce now.\n\nListen,realistically I don\u2019t think there is a future with him.", "Jesus I\u2019m so sorry that sounds so awful. I hope he realizes just how terrible that was to do to you regardless of what you agreed. It\u2019s not funny and totally unnecessary. NTA", "I\u2019m not sure I could get over the mean-spiritedness of that gift.", ">Will told me that he has realised he never wants to get married again.\n\nI don't get the joke. Like a petty, private resentment on an ex-wife that he's taking out on you while....buying a gift for himself?\n\nThis is so ridiculous.\n\nNAH", "NTA. IT was a nasty thing to do and if he thought it was funny, then the only appropriate thing for him to do when he saw you weren't amused was to apologize, explain it was meant as a joke, and give you your gift.\n\nIT sounds as though Will is much more hung up on the issue of marriage than you are. I'd talk to him, point out that he has told you he doesn't want to get married and you've accepted that, but ask him why he felt he had to humiliate you in front of all of your friends, on an occasion which was supposed to be about you?\n\nAlso, the fact that he is still trying to gaslight you by claiming you are overreacting, instead of admitting that (at best) he made a major misjudgment) is a problem. He just showed you the kind of person he is. Pay attention. \n\nPeople make mistakes.  People make jokes or comments which they think are funny, but which are actually hurtful, but most people, when they make a mistake or upset their partner or other loved ones, try to address it. They apologize, they learn from the mistake so they don't do it again, they are able to acknowledge that they caused hurt, even of that wasn't their intent/. If someone is unable or unwilling to acknowledge that they made a mistake,  or worse, try to blame the victim when they cause distress, those things are big warning signs about them.\n\nI would rethink what he's told you about his divorce , and think very carefully about whether this is a relationship you want. Talk to him.  Now you have had a bit of time, is he still blaming you or is he open to listening to you and trying to understand why what he did was no t OK? I f he is open to reflecting on his actions then there's hope for you.", "Nta. Guess we know why ex wife doesn't want to stay in contact.", "Absolutely NTA, that was really inconsiderate of him. Like, i get that you could gift someone a prank present, but joking about not getting married with a present in such a way in front of other people is really too much", "NTA. A super-insensitive joke, on Will\u2019s part. And making you open it in front of everybody\u2014 it was narcissistic, frankly. Making a piece of your party all about him and how clever he thinks he is. \u201cCruel\u201d is right. I\u2019d reconsider the whole relationship.", "Welp now you know why he's divorced. NTA", "NTA.  Now you give him penis enlargement pills in front of his friends and family as joke.", "This is probably why he has an ex-wife, already. Find someone who is going to really love & cherish you. Drop this loser.", "Also, he can still give her diamonds even if they don\u2019t get engaged??? Like pretty earrings or a ring that doesn\u2019t have to mean they\u2019re getting married! Kinda rude on his part tbh", "I imagine most are, but what about this one in particular makes it seem more fake to you?", "Leaves me wondering just what he did to his ex-wife.", ">\"I bought a baby rattle because you can't have kids.\"\n\nJesus Christ. \n\nI was already thinking OP was NTA and the guy was an obvious AH, but when you reframe it like that it hits sooo much harder for me. \n\nImagine someone not just saying that but like... setting it up. It's not like dude just spoke without thinking. He had to go out and get this gift, pay for it, bring it home, wrap it, set up the public gift-opening, give it to OP and *still* thought this was funny. \n\nWhy do people.", "Or a cardboard baby.", "My favorite relationship advice is: \"don't marry anyone you wouldn't want to go through a divorce with\".\n\nI feel like this holds for long term relationships too: don't stay in a relationship with anyone you wouldn't want to go through a breakup with. This guy obviously does not handle backups well, and the longer you stick around, the worse it's gonna be.", "Plot twist - the \u201creal\u201d gift was an engagement ring \ud83e\udd23 So he can always say - well, I asked but you said no.", "Good reference", "One of the main reasons I am willing to have kids with my partner, and maybe this is a little sad, is because I know if things went tits-up those kids would have to fight us off on who got to have more time. The kids will always be first and we would do anything to avoid them seeing courthouses or abandonment. And that's how I know deep down it'll he okay.\n\nMaybe I'm paranoid ill admit that, but the comfort alone alleviates a lot of stress towards having children with someone.\n\nJust know you're out for each other best you can be. Even if it doesn't work. It's a good feeling.", "The guy has \"bad breaker upper\" written all over him\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMsq2ri6E8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMsq2ri6E8)", "\"I'm sorry I stormed out of the party over a joke. I know you were only kidding.\"\n\nShe's NTA for having feelings, but neither is he. This is two way street, which is why there are NAH.", "You can say N A H for the joke initially. But he is most definitely TA for how her treated her afterwards.", "I get your point. But isn't she as well for not accepting the real present and I assume, though she doesn't go in detail, that she said some things too?"]}
