He was my next door neighbour, and offered to help me put together flat pack furniture. We really hit it off, and have been together ever since.\n\nWill was married right out of high school to someone who was not a very good match. They were young, dumb, and made a colossal mistake. Will recognises now how crazy it was to marry someone at 18, but at the time, they really thought it was a good idea. That being said, the breakup and the fallout was terrible. This was before I met Will, but it sounds like both sides were out to inflict as much pain as possible. Fortunately there were no children or assets, but it was not a smooth process by any means.\n\nWill reached out to his ex-wife relatively recently (about two years ago) to apologise for all the pain he put her through, which I thought was quite nice of him to do. She also apologised for her actions, but both agreed that they did not want to stay in contact. However, coming out of that, Will told me that he has realised he never wants to get married again. This was a surprise to me, but I have never really wanted the white picket fence, so no marriage didn't really bother me. I am happy just to be in a long-term, committed relationship.\n\nRecently, it was my birthday and we had some people over for a BBQ. It was really lovely, but Will insisted we do presents in front of everyone. I haven't ever really done that, but I didn't have any issues with it. Everyone gifted me really sweet and thoughtful items, and it was a blast, until I got to Will's gift. Will had been really bragging about how this was the perfect gift and I had to save the best for last... It was a diamond tipped drill set. To be clear, I do not own a drill and have no interest in anything related to drills.\n\nMy face fell, and Will burst out laughing saying that that the joke is that these diamonds are the only diamonds I could ever expect to receive from him. \"Get it, because we aren't ever getting engaged?\" I was so humiliated! I excused myself and went into the house, and I suppose that everyone left after a while.\n\nWill tried to then give me my \"real\" present later that evening because \"the drill bits were only meant as a joke\", but I didn't even open it because I couldn't understand why he was so cruel in front of all my friends! Will says that I am overreacting when I have another gift and I agreed that we wouldn't get married. I feel really hurt and Will doesn't seem to get it, am I overreacting?", "created_utc": 1679388372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xb9pr/aita_for_my_reaction_to_my_birthday_present/", "score": 1247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's awkward, rude, and cruel. You have every right to be pissed. If he's a great guy this could be a hard learning experience to grow from, but if you were unsure about a future with him I'd be over his shit. \n\nI'm curious if literally anyone but him thought this was funny.

That's the kind of thing you pull and let the awkward silence set in for a moment before dropping to one knee in front of everyone you know and giving a really heartfelt proposal. This dudes just a dick.", "NTA. Belittling and very immature. A real dick move. Hahaha, I don\u2019t want to marry you, here\u2019s a symbolic gift of my lack of respect for you.

Find someone who is.", "NTA because that is a cruel thing to do but I think you do want to get married and that's why you found that cruel/humiliating.

To make sure they knew....to humiliate you.\n\nNTA\n\nHe is a total AH, more worrying... it could have been a mistake but instead if realising and saying sorry, he is doubling down and defending it. It doesn't surprise me that his ex wants nothing to do with him...he is cruel and malicious.", "He's an asshole. NTA. Even if he had done this as a \"gag\" gift just with the two of you, it would be insensitive. Deliberately setting this up as a big production in front of friends is cruel, and almost unforgivable.", "NTA.  You could have used inappropriate or bad judgement to describe Will\u2019s joke but you used cruel.  Cruel is a very strong emotional charged word.  There is a reason this hurt you so much and you owe it to yourself to explore why.  \n\nYou need to take time to seriously reflect on if never marrying is really what you want.  Take Will out of the thought process as having someone specific in mind muddies the water as there are emotions attached to him.\n\nLook into your future and see yourself unmarried at 65.  Are you OK never having married?  What about children?  How do you feel about not having any or having them while unmarried?  If you are ok with never marrying that\u2019s absolutely fine.  But if you find that you do want to get married then this was the cue that this relationship has sadly run its course.\n\nMy only advice is be true to yourself as the longest relationship you\u2019ll ever have is with yourself so do what\u2019s right for you.", "NTA. A joke is funny. This was definitely a lapse in judgment on his part. He is definitely old enough to understand why doing this particular diamond-related slam would be absolutely unacceptable under most circumstances. \n\nPersonally, I find this kind of \u201chumor\u201d simply a way to insult and demean people and then \u201claugh it off,\u201d something I made very clear to my (now) husband early on. If someone feels badly afterwards, it\u2019s not funny in my book. That said, I\u2019m aware not everyone agrees with that, and often friends have a sort of roasting humor with each other that everyone is ok with. Although I always wonder if EVERYONE is really ok with it. \n\nIf Will has a history of this kind of \u201cjust kidding\u201d kind of jokes, has OP previously reacted/told him it was not funny to her? Is this the first such offense?\n\nPeople often show you exactly who they are. It\u2019s best, IMO, to believe them.", "NTA\n\nThe present by itself was mean, doing it publicly was meaner, laughing in the moment was meanest and insisting he\u2019s right and you\u2019re overreacting is meanerest.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your boyfriend\u2019s an AH.", "It wasn\u2019t a joke, it was a childish prank in which only he intended to come out of this looking good.

The correct way is to diss/joke privately, but praise publicly.", "NTA. What he did was incredibly mean and unnecessary. It's not even a real joke if the point is to purposely humiliate you and announce to others that you'll never get engaged. You have every right to be upset, even if he got you a \"real\" present and gave it to you later (after everyone has already left). It might be a good idea to sit down and think about his behavior over the course of your relationship. This likely isn't the first time he's behaved in an unnecessarily mean way, even if it is the first time he's made you the target (which I highly doubt is the first real time). It's also important to think about the long term. Will has shown that he'll be mean to you as a \"joke\" and be dismissive of your feelings afterward. Marriage or no marriage, that's unacceptable behavior in a healthy long term relationship", "Dude sounds like my ex. My ex was an AH. Seriously he took your birthday and made it about him being \"unmarriable\" and he thought it was funny to be cruel to your in front of your friends. Fuck that guy you're NTA at all.", "NTA. You might have agreed that your relationship was more important than the idea of being married, but that doesn't mean you agreed to have your desire for marriage made fun of.\n\n\"These are the only diamonds you'll ever get from me\" is not a joke but a dig. And all the more so given that plenty of people in unmarried relationships buy jewellery for their partners.\n\nIn other words, you prioritised your relationship ahead of your own preferences for marriage, because you care for him and his feelings. He prioritised publicly voicing his distaste for marriage and denigrating your feelings, over showing how much he cares for you because...?", "I don't know what the heck that was but it certainly wasn't a joke.

I guess the only bright side is that you can expect an apology 10+ years later for this incident.", "NTA he purposely tried to make a spectacle out of you in front of your friends on your birthday. That's really shitty. Jokes like that aren't really jokes they're disguised cruelty. Jokes are meant to make you laugh not make you feel shitty.

He made a fool of you at your birthday party. He is definitely not a catch, tbh.", "NTA, and honestly I feel like this relationship has run its course.

You could easily change you mind and get a lovely emerald ring from a lovely man.", "NTA even remotely. I never understood the whole \"give people a gift that's going to make them sad/upset and laugh at their expense before giving them their real gift\" thing. My family used to do this to kids at Xmas by giving them a big box and they'd get all excited about opening it, only for it to be coal so the kids would be crying before they'd bring out the actual gift. It's not cool and it sounds like Will needs to work through some issues. Just because he had a bad first marriage doesn't mean a subsequent one would be the same thing and punishing you because he mad bad decisions in the past is cruel.", "NTA. That was cruel and unnecessary on so many levels.", "Nta,\n\nI get why he got divorce now.\n\nListen,realistically I don\u2019t think there is a future with him.", "Jesus I\u2019m so sorry that sounds so awful.

IT was a nasty thing to do and if he thought it was funny, then the only appropriate thing for him to do when he saw you weren't amused was to apologize, explain it was meant as a joke, and give you your gift.\n\nIT sounds as though Will is much more hung up on the issue of marriage than you are. I'd talk to him, point out that he has told you he doesn't want to get married and you've accepted that, but ask him why he felt he had to humiliate you in front of all of your friends, on an occasion which was supposed to be about you?\n\nAlso, the fact that he is still trying to gaslight you by claiming you are overreacting, instead of admitting that (at best) he made a major misjudgment) is a problem. He just showed you the kind of person he is. Pay attention. \n\nPeople make mistakes.  People make jokes or comments which they think are funny, but which are actually hurtful, but most people, when they make a mistake or upset their partner or other loved ones, try to address it. They apologize, they learn from the mistake so they don't do it again, they are able to acknowledge that they caused hurt, even of that wasn't their intent/. If someone is unable or unwilling to acknowledge that they made a mistake,  or worse, try to blame the victim when they cause distress, those things are big warning signs about them.\n\nI would rethink what he's told you about his divorce , and think very carefully about whether this is a relationship you want. Talk to him.  Now you have had a bit of time, is he still blaming you or is he open to listening to you and trying to understand why what he did was no t OK?

He's just shown you he hasn't changed.\n\nI'm not one to suggest walking away over one mistake, even one this big. Some people just think differently, or didn't think it through, or are just that stupid. The thing I look for is *remorse*. My wife is on the spectrum and often speaks and acts without any thought of what it might look like to someone else. At first glance she can only see things from her point of view, and it can take a lot of stern explanation liberally sprinkled with analogies to get her to see another angle. It's *infuriating*, but it's not on purpose and she shows *regret* over it. She hates it, and she tells me as much.
