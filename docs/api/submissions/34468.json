That you are setting the boundary that they do not have to like the name, but you do not want to hear any more negative comments about anyone's name (your child or anyone else's name). If they can't respect that boundary, you'll have to end the interaction immediately (i.e. hang up the phone, pack up and leave from a visit, ask them to leave if they're over your home, etc.) \n\nBoundaries need to be things you can control with your own actions (i.e. leaving) rather than some sort of threat or punishment you can't or won't enforce. It also doesn't require any conversation or agreement from them on the subject - it's simply expressing the conditions under which you're willing to engage with them, and what will happen if they don't follow those conditions. If it happens, immediately follow through: \"I'm sorry to end this interaction like this, but I've asked you not to criticize names so I'm going to go now. We can try this again another time.\" And follow through without further discussion, regardless of what they say or do.
