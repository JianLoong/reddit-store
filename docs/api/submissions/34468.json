Your family is being incredibly rude about this and I would be worried about them making rude comments to your son in the future", "You're NTA, your parents shouldn't say things like that, and it's not surprising that you'd react that way. \n\nWhere I'm from, Reid definitely is an uncommon name though, especially for a first name. It's more of a last name. He's going to have to tell people how to spell it every time he talks to someone over the phone. People will occasionally misspell it on his paperwork.  I don't think it's a bad name or anything, just that you're denying a bit of reality here.", "NTA - Reid has been making blips in the top 1000 baby boy names since the [late 19th century.](https://www.behindthename.com/name/reid/top/united-states) And it has a very rich history, way deeper than \u201cthe last 20-30 years.\u201d\n\nNot that it matters either way. It\u2019s your and your husband\u2019s baby, you two get the final say here. They need to stop being so picky about something they don\u2019t get to pick.", "NTA. \n\nWell unless Reid is how it is pronounced but spelled something like Ruhwayeehd. \n\nOr spelled Reid but pronounced Ruhwayeehd. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how they feel that is a \u201ctrendy\u201d name. \n\nBut, if the only names they like are Ben, James and Bill, then something like Jeremy or Roger would seem pretty exotic to them. \n\nReid is far from one of the trendy names.", "NTA, it's not the most common name, and that's fine, and it's not a name guaranteed to be mocked, like Gertrude or something.", "They really don\u2019t need to like it and their opinion doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a beautiful name and the fact that you and your husband both love it and feel it suits your son is all that matters. I\u2019d draw a firm boundary that negative or critical comments surrounding his name will not be tolerated and if they can\u2019t not make them you will be hanging up or leaving.\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "Sorry you\u2019re surrounded by AH\u2019s. Reid is a perfect name.", "Your family is a bunch of AHs. I struggle to imagine what it\u2019s like being so inflexibly wedded to old-fashioned names that they \u201chate\u201d the name you picked for your child. How wildly petty of them. I\u2019ve seen a few baby name posts on here. Only once did I consider the parent to be the AH, and it\u2019s because the child shared a name with an infectious disease.\n\nReid is a perfectly nice name. It hits the sweet spot of being uncommon without being weird. Clear NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's not a terrible or embarrassing name. They're the problem, not the name.", "Your kid, their opinion doesn't matter, and if they don't like it they don't have to be around any of you.", "NTA\n\nThey are all being ridiculously rude and even cruel with their uncalled-for comments. I hope for your sake they learn a little bit of perspective and maturity.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your family is heavily invested in conformity. How boring and uncreative. Congratulations for giving you son a name you both liked. When we named our son, we very consciously avoided recycling family names because we considered them to have baggage (good and bad) and invited unnecessary comparison to the namesake.\n\nYou were on the mark with your response to your family. The fact that they tried to turn your characterization of their actions (\"rude and hurtful\") back on you and suggested that you were rude and childish makes the case for their being boring bourgeoisie. So glad you escaped their narrow mindedness and are able to stand up for your creative choices.\n\nOn another note, I applaud you consideration for your husband --it would have been annoying to subject him to you family's vapid complaints.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Their reaction would make more sense if you'd chosen something actually damaging/disrespectful to your son, like Thanos or &t1 or Exo\\[dial-up modem noise\\], but Reid isn't a weird or trendy name. It's very normal, if uncommon, and has been around for centuries.\n\nIf they want to be in your family's life, they need to start acting mature and reasonable about your baby's name. There's nothing wrong with Reid as a name other than it's not part of their usual roster, and they need to acclimate to & ultimately get over that on their own time, without making it your, your husband's, or your son's problem.", "NTA Reid isn't an outlandish name.

Bottom line - the only people that need to agree on the name are you and your spouse.  If you are happy they can get over it.  And if they care for you they will.  Reid is a lovely name!\n\nSide note:  I come from one of those families that wouldn\u2019t hesitate to firmly state their opinions as well.  I\u2019d encourage you to set firm boundaries with them moving forward.  It made a massive difference in the quality of our interactions for me.  \u201cI hear that you don\u2019t like the name we picked - and you are welcome to hold that opinion.  However, my husband and I have agreed and feel like this is the best choice.  We have listened to your objections but our decision stands.  I would appreciate it if you would respect our choice moving forward.\u201d  And then end the conversation - if they continue to cross the boundary you may have some hard choices to make regarding the type of relationship you want to maintain.", "It's pretty common in our city. I work in a daycare and I have seen a few Reid's come through and nobody had an issue with their name. I know that won't be true everywhere. But the name is definitely not that uncommon here.

I think some of it will always come back to me going with a name that wasn't used by the family already. The fact it's not even that different really was unlikely to matter much."]}
