But it's totally fine to let your child know in an age appropriate way that money is a bit tight for luxuries. There's a difference to gently explaining in a reassuring way over listening to your parents scream at each other. Otherwise the constant shutting down of requests will probably feel to her like you just don't want to and may breed resentment. Your sister is a big AH for exasperating the issue, nothing wrong with having a chat to her either but given her mentality that may not have a huge effect.", "NTA. Make her be there when you tell your child next time.. maybe seeing the kids dreams smash like a cheap mirror....she will stop. She needs to stop getting their hopes so high. Its different if it was 'when you grow up. You can buy anything you ever wanted' thats fine!! But not 'well mommy should buy you these $100 Nike shoes vs those $10 walmart shoes' or whatever the case is. Easy for her to say that when she doesnt have to worry about those extra expenses ((I am NOT going after her infatility. Please dont take it that way!!))", "NTA and tell sis anything she suggests again she should be willing to pay for. She\u2019s being mean to your kid. She knows you can\u2019t afford it.

It's well past time your sister remembers you don't have her disposable income.
