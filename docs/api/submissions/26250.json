The injury looked really bad and I felt that he would not make it if left without help. However as mentioned above I own 2 cats and I am responsible for them and thus I cannot spare extra money to save this cat.\n\n\nSo I contacted some animal rescuing volunteer groups to see if they are willing to help this stray cat. \"Tony\", took up this case and brought the injured cat back with him. The cat was treated and released back after a few weeks when he was well enough.\n\n\nTony had been urging me for the past few months to help him to find donation for the cat's medical fees as he claims it broke him. I did shared around to my friends and families for donation but he barely got anything back. He became more and more aggressive pressuring me to help him look for other sorts of donations such as cat food and supplies.\n\n\nWhen I finally had enough and told Tony that he was harassing me he called me ungrateful, saying that \"people like me\" is the reason he has many debts helping animals and can barely make ends meet. He said that after helping \"my cat\" the least I could do was to help him find more people willing to donate. I told him that I don't owe him anything, that injuired cat is not mine and he could only blame himself if he is struggling. I blocked him shortly\n\n\nNow I feel bad for him. Even though the cat is not mine, Tony helped it under my request, and I am slamming door at his face when he is broke. On the other hand I don't feel that it is right to demand donations from me or finding donors for him when he wasn't helping \"me\" to be exact.

Tony doesn\u2019t know what it means to be a volunteer and if he can\u2019t fulfill the role, he should pull back from it and focus on stabilizing his life, financially. That\u2019s not upto you to figure out for him.", "NTA\n\nHe is a volunteer and it's his responsibility to manage his expenses. It might be sad but the harsh reality is, that he can't help every animal and he shouldn't do more than he is actually able to do.\n\nYou didn't make him take care of your cat, you informed him about a injured stray cat.", "NTA. When you asked for help you asked of sane people who could actually manage to help. Clearly you did not expect any one to ruint their own life for a a cat.

Him going broke was his choice. \n\nEither Tony has some mental issues that no amount of money will fix or he is scamming you.", "You knew you couldn't afford to help the cat so you reached out to an organization you thought could.

If you do donate, do it directly to the rescue and not to him personally.", "NTA. You didn't force him to look after the cat. He made the choice to help. This is all on him.", "NTA.\n\nTony does not look stable. It is his fault if he is running a one person cat charity with his own money.\n\nAccording to \"the gift of fear\", the best thing to do is not to react anymore and wait for him to find somebody else to stalk. Be cautious, but each interaction is likely to make him push more, pushing back might turn him hostile.", "not the AITA he offered to help the cat knowing that it wasn\u2019t even ur cat, you did what you could with trying to help get donations i think that\u2019s good enough", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
