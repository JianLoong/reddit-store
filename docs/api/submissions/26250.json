The cat was treated and released back after a few weeks when he was well enough.\n\n\nTony had been urging me for the past few months to help him to find donation for the cat's medical fees as he claims it broke him. I did shared around to my friends and families for donation but he barely got anything back. He became more and more aggressive pressuring me to help him look for other sorts of donations such as cat food and supplies.\n\n\nWhen I finally had enough and told Tony that he was harassing me he called me ungrateful, saying that \"people like me\" is the reason he has many debts helping animals and can barely make ends meet. He said that after helping \"my cat\" the least I could do was to help him find more people willing to donate. I told him that I don't owe him anything, that injuired cat is not mine and he could only blame himself if he is struggling. I blocked him shortly\n\n\nNow I feel bad for him. Even though the cat is not mine, Tony helped it under my request, and I am slamming door at his face when he is broke.

They aim to help stray animals - whether that\u2019s getting them emergency care or finding them a home. \n\nWhile they do typically run off donations, that is the rescue\u2019s business to generate. Not yours. \n\nYou did the right thing. You were helping care for a stray within your abilities (feeding it sometimes and helping it work socialization) and when you realized the stray needed help you couldn\u2019t provide you reached out to a rescue. \n\nYou do not owe the rescue anything.", "YTA.  If you want to help out a stray cat, you should be prepared to pay for the expense and not pawn it off on someone else.", "ESH.  The guy is obviously the main asshole here and you can block him, but Im giving you a soft YA for feeding stray or feral cats.  I completely understand the urge to, but you're doing more harm than good for the cats (and often for yourself)\n\nStray cats are domesticated and used to humans - if the cat you're feeding is a stray, it should be picked up and re-homed. If its a feral cat, it is not domesticated and was born outdoors and knows how to obtain its own food. In either case, feeding them is problematic as you're either creating a dependency (eg they will stop hunting for their own food) or you're going to attract more and more cats which means more disease and more breeding, or you're going to start attracting more than cats, including pests and more dangerous animals.   Feral cats are also pretty important in the local ecosystem - eating rats and other pests - so it has a bigger impact than you'd think.\n\nIf you see a cat that is clearly okay with humans and will interact with you, please just take it to a shelter rather than feeding it. If the cat is hesitant, doesnt immediately go for the food, and is cautious or hissing, its feral.  Check to see if it has a sign that it's been spayed/neutered and leave it alone if it has.  If it hasn't, call animal control and they will pick it up and do so (and release it right back on the streets afterward)", "YTA you couldn't contribute?", "There is what you're legally required to do, and what you should do to keep from being an AH.  If I find an injured animal and have to take him to a volunteer or rehabilitator, it's an AH move to think that these people operate on vapor.  I always leave a donation with them.  In fact, if they are going to find a home, or release him back in the wild, I'll foot the whole bill.  If they believe euthanasia is necessary, then I'll pay for that.  It's exactly as if I'm paying for them to provide a service that I can't do on my own.\n\nI think that it is the height of entitlement to dump an injured animal on their doorstep and tell them, \"Here's a serious problem I found, now you take care of it, good luck with that.\"\n\nYTA", "Op definitely needs to report this guy if he\u2019s going around harassing people for donations, not exactly the kind of exposure these groups would need, especially if he gets resources for animal care from the organization.", "She didn\u2019t pawn it off, she reached out to an animal rescue group. Should she have performed surgery herself?", "It's never a clear thing and say that as someone whose been on both sides. Cat was in clear need and she stepped up for it and got it help from an organisation that said that was what they did. You promote yourself as a rescue that is what you sign up for. OP did a good thing. Cat would have died otherwise.\n\nTom, or organisation he says he represents, have choices too. They know their funding situation. They could have euthanaised cat which would still have been a better death than on streets. They choose to treat and incur bills.\n\nI will admit it can rankle when people offload their financial and emotional burden onto you without a look back. But that is more owner surrenders and again what you put your name out into public for. All donations eagerly welcomed but not every one in a place to do so.\n\nOP needs to close door on this. She did what she could for the cat. And if a bigger organisation, then yes let them know what is going on. It is out of order.", "Not always. There is a very narrow window to tame feral kittens and a feral adult cat may not be able to adjust. Trap, neuter, release programmes neuter the cats and then return them to the colony. Usually they are being fed and monitored for issues. Places for barn cats are sadly few and far between.", "If she could afford the expense, she'd take the tabby to a vet instead of calling volunteer organisations. The whole point of volunteer organisations is that they /volunteer/ to take care of these animals, without an expectation from you to foot the bill.", "I feel like you did not read the post.", "I'm not trying sound smart here but this is an honest question. So he states he doesn't have the money to help the cat but it's severely injured, so what should he do?\n\nAlso this whole thing fees suspect to me. I've volunteered at a large pet rescue and we never asked anyone to reimburse us in these situations. As a matter of fact a local vet provided a lot of these services free of charge. It might be legit, but just feels odd.", "if he couldn't afford to help the cat, then he shouldn't have paid. someone else would have done something.", "Do you think OP should have performed the surgery herself? Seriously, what should she have done? She found an injured cat and gave him to a rescue group. Taking him to the shelter = being put down. Taking him to the vet = she has to pay a bill. What should OP have done?"]}
