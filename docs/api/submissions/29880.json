It\u2019s very important that he gets a new car for the winters where I live so he can still get to work. However he has it in his head that he wants a mustang. I let him know I will not be co signing anything for him due to some of his unpaid debts and the lack of financial help he has given me like helping pay rent since he has finished school and is now in full time employment. (I cut him a break when he went through school.) he is very upset that I will not co sign for him.

Be glad this has happened BEFORE you have any legally binding financial commitment to this man. He's willing to sink his money and yours into a childish fantasy, and is happy to sulk and make you suffer when you don't go along with his idiocy.

At the very least.", "It's never easy to end a relationship, but in this case, it is. Bro doesn't help with bills and keeps persisting about co-signing a loan for a car that at this stage he can't pay back on and is basically gonna be relying on you more.\n\nInsane, utterly, that you think this man is worth keeping around when you have your shit together and he doesn't.

Don\u2019t co-sign for him. If you get married any debts he accumulates when you are together become yours too. It is time for couples counseling at the least and seriously consider pushing the wedding date out at least another year if you plan to stay with him so you have time to assess if the counseling has paid off or if he grows up enough to consider going through with the wedding. Currently he is sponging off you.  A mustang is not a practical choice and his behavior as you described it makes him sound like a child. He sounds very selfish. Proceed with extreme caution !!!", "NTA.  He\u2019s not contributing to your relationship financially, and he wants to put you in the hook for a big expense he can\u2019t really afford.  At an absolute bare minimum, he needs to wait on the Mustang until he has his license and can afford the payments.  Not living off your income should be a higher priority for him than the shiny car.  It sounds like he\u2019s been stunted developmentally around money (which, to be fair, is a fairly common effect of the financial abuse he suffered).", "NTA, If I NEEDED a co-signer for something in my life right now I would have multiple people who I know would be able and willing to help me out, but the fact that your fianc\u00e9 is seemingly entirely reliant on you for his current living situations and also wasn\u2019t in control of his previous living situations then he doesn\u2019t have the financial experience or personal life experience to be trusted with a loan that YOUR name is going to be on. He hasn\u2019t proven that he can even help pay rent, but he\u2019s going to suddenly start making his car payments for 6 years after never being responsible for anything? I highly doubt it. If he wants a car, then he can buy a car, but you should not be putting your own credit on the line when he\u2019s clearly failed everyone else\u2019s personal credit check.", "NTA. Tell him when he passes that exam and gets a job with good income you can revisit the Mustang conversation. For now hes just gotta suck it up with the lesser car. Especially if he isnt helping with bills.", "NTA.  Never ever co-sign for a loan unless you are prepared to lose that money AND have it affect your credit.  If he has bad credit, his insurance costs will also be more expensive. \n\nHe is acting like a petulant child that throws temper tantrums when denied a toy.

You don't want to tie your credit to someone who, it sounds like, is impulsive and unconcerned with financial stability. He doesn't need to be getting a luxury (like a mustang) until he is able to handle his necessities (like rent). There's always public transportation, or taxis. Yes, I am well aware of how much that sucks/expensive they are: I relied on them for a time. You (he, in this case) just have to suck it up until you're in a stable enough position that getting transportation won't cause mayhem to his fragile financial stability.", "OP, you have been supporting him up to now in your relationship. You paid rent and bills for you both while he was in school. You have clearly been the responsible one, even though you are five years younger than him. But I also think you are foolish to think that a person will suddenly change to become as responsible and mature as you when he has shown very little interest in doing so.\n\nSo now I ask, why should he expect the relationship to change after two years together? From his view, you've been ok with supporting him up to now,  I imagine he thinks that's the way things will stay. You need to decide whether you will be ok with staying in a relationship with someone with his lesser ability to plan and save, because I doubt he will change. At this point, screaming at him or trying to explain the practicality of buying the cheaper car likely won't work.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. Why would you marry someone who you don't trust enough to pay is car loan? who is focused on buying a toy rather then a needed vehicle? Who doesn't contribute his share?\n\nmove on & find a man not a manboy.", "NTA - he would likely crash it with his child like mind anyway. \nGet this boy a push bike and send him on his way.", "Never co sign with this parasite. He doesn't even pay rent, he will leave you with the entire debt", "Why are you hung up on a date for a wedding when all these red flags are waving? NTA.", "Please observe the red flags, OP. Please, do not cosign. Please, stop supporting this person. You're not doing him or yourself any favors.", "OP please remember this piece of advice.  UNLESS you can use them as a tax deduction, DO NOT allow yourself to be paying their own bills, let alone potentially marry them.  If you haven't done it already, run a credit check on him and THEN decide if it's worthwhile continuing the relationship and bumping up that credit score in a satisfactory range.", "NTA - you are going to be supporting this guy for the rest of your life.  \nWake Up !!!", "Why? Why are you engaged to this loser? Please do better.", "NTA\n\nDO NOT CO-SIGN FOR ANYTHING WITH ANYONE EVER\n\nIn fact I think it's time to end this relationship because he clearly doesn't care about you, he just wants to mooch off you", "Dont worry about finding a wedding date - hopefully you will figure it out befor you take vows.\n\nHe is not a partner. He loves himself - he hasnt learned what it means to love someone.  You are a resource for him. A security.\n\nNTA keep finances separate, and if he doesn't pay his share - he needs to leave", "The obvious answer is NTA and don\u2019t co-sign.  Just for funsies though, get an insurance quote on a new Mustang. Because you will likely see some sticker shock there as well. And seriously, he needs a new car for winter driving and he is going to buy\u2026 a Mustang?!? Just no. He will end up insisting on borrowing your car when the weather is bad. So get ready for that too. He clearly has zero plan to contribute to rent and utilities in the future either.", "nta for not cosigning\n\nah to yourself for letting this man live off your hard work, then giving in(even temporarily) for taking on HIS debt for a car he doesn't need(mustang).  AND he can't even pass his exam--that he studied specifically for(while you supported his hobosexual bum).\n\nDon't do it anymore, get a little self-respect.(remember if you cosign that loan you are agreeing to make the loan payments or have the default on YOUR credit).", "BF Sounds like a himbo. \n\nI would not be surprised if something happens to the certificate etc. He isn\u2019t making good decisions.

Thank you.", "And his insurance will be more on a mustang", "He does care about me. I don\u2019t ever have to ask him twice to do anything. Takes care of household chores/shopping/errands. I do feel like he\u2019s my person but this car situation has put stress on me. We have been through a lot together but this is making me question if a marriage would even work. I can\u2019t continue to be the bread winner and he knows this.\n\nUpdate: i did just have a talk with him. He understands I refuse to sign for the car. He took care of rent, and paid utilities just now and even my personal phone bill for the month. Let\u2019s see if he keeps it up.

Follow what your gut tells you always. \n\nAnd do not give him money lol", "Stop helping this loser out - if he can\u2019t afford to help pay living experiences he can\u2019t afford a mustang. I don\u2019t give a crap about his earning potential - he hasn\u2019t even past the test yet. Don\u2019t marry him until he gets his shit together. If he can\u2019t, you need to leave", "Anyone who gets a 72 month loan on a car is a moron. Never do that.", "My question is why are you with this person? Seems like they are taking advantage of you.", "It's simple. Unless you want to be of the hook for the entire cost of the car, you never co-sign.", "I had a 48 mo loan that my broke ass can barely pay; it was nearly repossessed and I'm getting evicted soon so really needed to be able to keep it."]}
