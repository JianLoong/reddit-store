My husband and his siblings make a lot of jokes about it, I feel to cope, but basically he put every boomer stereotype to shame. He wanted nothing to do with his kids, bitched and moaned if MIL asked him to do anything, hired a nanny so she would stop asking, showed zero physical affection to his son and limited towards the girls, and openly admits he dislikes children. I think he had them because MIL wanted them, but the thing is she didn't. MIL wanted babies and toddlers, so around five they were handed off to the nanny.\n\nFIL claims he loves his kids. I have serious doubts. Anyway MIL was very sick about eight years ago. It was about 6 months before they could find the cause, and she was in and out of the hospital, and FIL did everything for her, pretty much just held her constantly, fed her, brushed her hair, because she was weak to the point she just did not care.\n\nAnyway SIL recently was saying how her dad is an asshole, but she wants a relationship like her parents have and no one is ever going to love her that much. Then she said her mom being ill made her have unrealistic standards for a man. I made a comment about how I was surprised FIL did all of that since he was too selfish to raise his own kids, and it seems so weird to me that he would do things for her that you would do for a child (absolutely no shade I know how genuinely sick she was) when he couldn't be bothered to do those things for his own kids.\n\nWell this got back to MIL and she called me shrieking and demanding an apology. She said I'm an asshole and how dare I compare her to a child being that sick didn't make her \"stupid\" and she said I'm a terrible person. I apologized but she was still mad and said I'm insensitive and she's always known I was \"evil\" FIL is pissed and said I insulted his character.", "created_utc": 1667596385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymamax/aita_for_expressing_surprise_that_fil_cared_for/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A wife and a child are different things. Some people just don't like kids. Period. I have a friend like that. Cannot stand them and will avoid events where there will be a lot of them. Yet she took care of my mom hand and foot when she had a major surgery and couldn't do anything for herself.    \n\n\nYeah sounds like neither were great parents but they weren't your parents so honest to goodness don't criticize them with things like that to their kids. That is a recipe for disaster.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have said what you did.\n\nPeople have very different types and depths of relationships with their spouses than their kids. \n\nMy husband has said that if anything happened to our son he'd be sad, but get over it, but if anything happened to me, he'd be devastated and not sure he'd be able to go on. \n\nYour IL's sound like a couple that live and love for each other and not their kids.", "INFO Why was that a thought you decided to say out loud?", "ESH, what you said was an unnecessary dig, and the in-laws are clearly two messed-up people who can show care for each other, but no one else.", "YTA. It sounds like you don\u2019t like  not having a free babysitter. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time you were \u201cjust being honest\u201d.

Caring for a spouse is nothing like caring for children. And, more important, this is none of your business.", "YTA, has anyone looked at FIL's childhood? I'm willing to bet his father was a hard-ass who's idea of saying \"I love you\" was \"Suck it up\".  That said, the relationship in a marriage is completely different than parent and child.", "A relationship between a husband and a wife is much different than that of a parent to child.  Lots of people who don\u2019t want or have kids step up big time to take care of their ill spouse.  YTA", "YTA, You talking smack about them so you'll get smacked down for it.\n\nThis was a tough one I wanted to say ESH, but being a good parent or good spouse are not synonymous, you can be both, either one, or none. Fil showing no love to his kids doesn't necessarily mean he was a jerk to them, just means he didn't put that extra love in there. \n\nAlso what Sil said wasn't unrealistic, if anyone gets sick, I think they would want to know their partner would hold them down.", "YTA.

SIL is the asshole for relaying that to her own mother to try to guilt trip and manipulate her.", "Yta. \n\nThe rule is \"I can say something bad about my parents, but you better not!\".\n\nIf you say something bad about your parents,  you are venting. If someone else does, it is complaining/insulting. \n\nYou should have known it would get back to mil. Now that you do, don't say that sort of thing to her family.", "NAH. You didn't mean anything rude by it, but them taking it poorly is almost to be expected. Family dynamics can be really difficult to understand. As someone with a shitty father, I get where your comment came from.\n\nIt's okay that you had that thought and it's okay that they were upset by it", "YTA. What an asinine thing to say.", "YTA - people are complicated and have complex relationships and are not perfect. It sounds like this man had some issues but in the end he does love his wife and maybe he does love his kids, in his own way. You complete over stepped here and you do owe them an apology. You were in fact being shady, and you got called out.", "YTA it sounds like FIL shouldn't have had kids but he's of a generation where the Life Script was pretty much mandatory. If he had his time again he probably wouldn't have had kids at all. It sucks that his kids had shitty parents.\n\nNot liking kids doesn't mean your incapable of love or taking care of someone you love.", "NTA. You called a shovel a shovel. Now the shovel is mad you don't think it's a bouncy house.", "YTA \n\nIt was not your place to make a comment like that and it was very mean spirited. Opinions and judgment like that should be kept to yourself and not shared with people in the family. Honestly, how did you expect that to turn out?", "NTA. It was a genuine reaction.\nWhere you effed up was saying it to her daughter. You can say all of the honest things you want to about your own family, but folks are automatically going to get defensive when an outsider makes those comments about theirs. You\u2019ll always be the first one they throw under the bus. Keep your judgments/knee jerk reactions and anything negative to yourself or to your friends who aren\u2019t in the family.", "YTA. Your FIL promised his wife \"in sickness and in health\". That he's so devoted is commendable. Sorry your husband is so bitter.", "YTA Some people simply don\u2019t like kids. That doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect on who they are as a person. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality that a lot of Boomer parents should not have been parents, but caring for kids you don\u2019t want and caring for a spouse you love and chose are two very different things. Yeah, it sucks that he treated his kids that way, but the two things are simply not comparable.", "YTA", "ESH - Why would you say something like that to your SIL? Why did SIL share your rude comment with her mother? Why does your MIL think children are inherently \"stupid?\"", "NTA for expressing your opinion; it\u2019s not your fault it wasn\u2019t received well by mil and fil. Btw, your sil is a real peach stirring the pot like that. I bet she\u2019s happy now.", "NTA. Called it like you saw it", "Some people don\u2019t want kids and have never wanted kids and having kids of their own won\u2019t always change how they feel about that. Plus, you feel differently for a partner/spouse than you do for kids. It\u2019s a different kind of love. But I understand where you\u2019re coming from", "YTA. It was an insensitive comment to make to his child. At most you could have expressed surprise that you didn't realize he had such a nurturing nature. Full stop. \n\nYou did insult them. Apologize. No one asked you to judge their relationship or how they decided to raise their children.", "YTA\n\nJust because someone doesn't want kids doesn't mean they don't love their parents, siblings or spouses and wouldn't care for them in a loving, tender way.\n\nYou seem angry at both of them. While I agree they don't sound like great parents, it's not your job to point it out.", "Listen, your husband can't help how he feels about people ultimately but, if i ever found out my father (or mother) ever said they'd \"be sad but get over it\" if I got seriously ill or died, but couldn't cope if the same happened to each of them I'd be devastated and probably struggle to ever truly be close to them ever again. I don't expect them to be *more* bothered by my ill health than theirs, but to make such a definitive claim of the difference irks me. Like I said, your husband can't help how he feels about whoever but to me that sounds like a horrifically tragic situation to speak of his kids like that.\n It's difficult because, like I said, I appreciate you can't help how you feel about any given person but at the same time it is instinctively repulsive to me to describe your kids ill health like so. That's his own progeny man, how can they be worth less than him to someone else. It's comes across that you are fine he cares for you a lot more than your kids - I'd personally be appalled if my wife implied that. \n\nI'm sorry if this comes across too judgementally, it just really hits something in me to hear that be said about someones own child.", "Pff come on. His supposed bad childhood, which is all an assumption by you by the way, is no excuse for him to have multiple children and not take care of then. Same for the MIL as well. If you have kids, its your responsibility not to pass on your trauma.", "His father was a drunk and an awful man. I could get it if he had issues showing love in general, but he has no issue being all over his wife, telling her he loves her. I would say him and MIL are actually gross and over the top with the PDA, so it isn't as if he is totally emotionally stunted", "Yea. It's not out of the realm of possibliity that someone who didn't want kids, but had them for their spouse, discovers that they really enjoy their adult children.", ">Sorry your husband is so bitter.\n\nWay to belittle someone who was neglected by his parents and also wasn't involved in this.", "It absolutely reflects on their character and them as a person wtf?? You're acting like he was forced to have children. No one forced him or the MIL to have unprotected sex multiple times to have children that were never taken care of. Both your kids and your spouse are a choice and decision that you make, so yeah he should care for them both. It's absolutely comparable", "If you don\u2019t like kids, don\u2019t have kids. I wouldn\u2019t hold it against someone. \n\nBut if you don\u2019t like kids and you have kids that reflects badly on you as a person and people will think you are a bad person.", "I am close to SIL and didn't see anything wrong with what I said. It wasn't the SIL I was talking to, but their other sister who happened to be there. She tells MIL everything to get more money and gifts. MIL just has no patience for children. She mistook loving babies with wanting to be a mother, but once they get old enough to disagree with her she thinks they are just stupid. She actually believes everyone is stupid and she is a genius, but that is a whole other issue", "I'm more curious about your upbringing and why you're so put off by his devotion to his wife.", "That makes so much sense!  Adult relationships and the ensuing affection are completely different than parental.  When you have had severely horrible parenting as a kid, it makes being a parent difficult.  There are those people that it just comes to naturally, but not everyone. So in a lot of ways, he is emotionally stunted when it comes to being a father.", "So you said it, fully knowing it would cause trouble? Yeah, YTA", "YTA for saying something you know would get back to the person concerned (thru a specific tattler)"]}
