It's comes across that you are fine he cares for you a lot more than your kids - I'd personally be appalled if my wife implied that. \n\nI'm sorry if this comes across too judgementally, it just really hits something in me to hear that be said about someones own child.", "Pff come on.

I'm one of them.  I would rather die than have a child, but when my father came down with dementia, I took care of him.  Because i adored him.  There's something wrong with you.", "In all honesty? I have to give an ESH and even despite all that has been said about the FIL he barely constitutes part of that. Like...ok, yeah, your FIL was not exactly a paternal father of the year, and he was always up front about that. He probably shouldn't have had kids, but whatever, what's done is done and it's not like he can unimpregnate his wife 30 or 40 years later. Plus, this is all said within the same context as everyone involved more or less admitting the MIL was equally as ineffectual as a parent.\n\nFrankly, I think between the parent who only had kids to keep his marriage and the parent who said, \"I love children\" and really meant, \"babies\" I'd say at least the former was a good provider if he could afford a nanny to any degree of constancy. The woman's like those assholes who adopt pets for a season, or until they exit puppy/kittenhood and off to the pound they go...or the wilds. I can't really say anything positive about a caregiver who only doesn't leave their now no longer cute children on the side of a mountain because that's no longer socially acceptable. \n\nAs for both SIL and you? Yeah, you both were acting catty and shitty, and it got back to your extended family. The conflict is very much your fault for at least not vetting trustworthy ears on the subject. Your MIL also didn't really do herself any favors with her phrasing, but by all rights your FIL has every right to be angry with what was said about him.", "I'm going with NTA.  They still need to realize how shitty they treated their own kids.  Having a nanny raise them is not parenting.  Don't have kids if you don't want to raise them.", "NTA.", "ESH. I get where you\u2019re coming from. I\u2019d also be surprised that someone so famously unloving to their children could be so loving to anything or anyone else\u2026 but you should\u2019ve kept that to yourself. SIL knew sharing that info with her parents would blow up on you. I would think twice about sharing sensitive thoughts with her in the future.", "YTA. You're basing your opinion on him based on second hand information, and observations made when everyone was older, and the big thing you're missing is, his wife is his life partner, he fell in love with her, and he very clearly loved her, and she him, they're still married after all these years, that love is so very different to that of the love a parent has for their child.", "YTA.\n\nFIL may not be much of a dad, but you're not much of a DIL, either. Maybe keep your thoughts to yourself or between yourself and your husband from here on out.", "YTA cuz you said something knowing that other people around you could pass on the things you said. You gotta know better than to slip up like that when it comes to dealing with family politics.\n\nI also think you need to look into your MIL and FIL\u2019s perspectives. Older generations have different values and attitudes toward familial roles. My great grandfather was very similar; he was not an involved father in any of his five daughters\u2019 lives, and honestly had some old fashioned notions of gender roles, but when his wife had a stroke and was permanently disabled, he dotingly cooked and cared for her until the day he died. I think he cared for her for ten years or something, and when he passed, she went less then a year later, so we know she missed his TLC. The devotion he had for her was very admirable, and I think that is just a product of the time they were married in and the kind of commitments they made to each other. I think being a father and being a husband was just that different for him. \n\n(Not at all excusing being a shitty dad btw, he\u2019s def a hypocrite on that)", "NTA they are being dramatic and taking your comments out of context.  Ignore and move on.  I would also be shocked if someone who could happily neglect a child would then turn around and care for an adult- it\u2019s sickening.", "YTA. Filter!", "Sigh. Everybody needs to simmer down. She was speaking to the SIL she's close to, not the one who repeated what she said. Pretty sure OP was not looking to cause WWIII, but the SIL that repeated it sure was.", "> Why does your MIL think children are inherently \"stupid?\"\n\nYou don't have to think all children are stupid to understand that comparing another adult to a child MEANS they are calling you stupid", "Mine isn't as bad a OPs but my father loves my mother to the moon and back 1000 times and would do anything for her. If it came to changing her diapers he would not hesitate even a moment to do so. Didn't do it often for brother and I as babies, he does still love us a lot but he finds it gross and if he doesn't have to tolerate it he won't. But he can, and he would if needed because he loves us and wanted us to be happy and healthy.  Mom is and always will be number one by miles, and if mom needed him, no force would stop him.", "Also, it is one thing for someone to make comments/jokes about their own parents/upbringing, but it is another thing entirely for someone else to do it. \n\nThis isn't OP's dad.

Like wtf.", "My heart breaks for your son", "OP was apparently fully aware the SIL she was talking to would repeat it to her parents, which makes it a YTA for me. Like, why? Why start that kind of conflict?", "There's a whole psychological and anthopological deep dive here that I'm not going to get into about patriarchal views, upper middle class family structure in the mid 20th century, toxic masculinity, and possible narcissism, suffice it to say, they sound like a typical family of that boomer era. That being said, the things you said to their daughter, those are things we think quietly to ourselves, maybe express to our husband, or a trusted friend *outside* the family, what you did was make sure they heard what you thought, while being too cowardly to say it to their faces, you knew what you were saying would cause problems other wise you'd have done just that, said it to them directly, you wanted to get your jab in without having to face the consequences. YTA", "It\u2019s kinda weird for you to weigh in on your MIL & FIL parenting since you aren\u2019t their kid.

Seems like you were trying to stir shit tbh. If you have a problem with MIL just tell her, but you should focus on what happens btw y\u2019all, not what observe or hear about with others", "But it doesn't. In this case, MIL  was too sick and frail to do daily care tasks. A child isn't *too stupid* to brush their own hair or get themselves dressed. They just haven't developed the dexterity and been shown how yet.", "Some people are terrible parents. Some people, especially older boomers and the generation before them had kids because it's what they thought they were supposed to do. Sometimes bc fails and they didn't have a choice. Sometimes they don't know that they wouldn't love their kids. \n\nI am not defending people who don't love their children. My mother didn't love the 4 kids she had after her number one son was born, so believe me, I know firsthand the trauma of being unloved. Doesn't mean I need to have it thrown in my face. \n\nIf you don't have the guts to tell someone to their face how you feel about them, don't send of the flying monkeys to do the job for you. It's gutless.", "Actually OP responded that he did indeed have a bad childhood. It's a reason, not an excuse. That generation also tends to not be open to therapy or self-examination in general. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps! It's ridiculous. \nI agree with you. It's your job as a parent to not pass on your trauma and to break generational abuse.", "Actually it makes sense. He didn't HAVE a close SAFE relationship with his father, so he NEVER actually experienced what a healthy loving father-son relationship was so he couldn't emulate that to his own kids. He could only emulate what he knew how to be as a father. so chances are he saw his father dote and love his mother BUT not on him. \n\nHe likely didn't get therapy for the abuse he went through as a kid (as a raging alcoholic i'm sure their was plenty) and he didn't have a step-father or teacher, or uncle etc to teach him how to be a good father or be that father role model.\n\nThe man is literally doing as he was taught. No one told or taught him better. ITs something that comes with generations of shitty parents. He unfortunately wasn't able to break the cycle with his own kids. And believe it or not I bet he does feel shitty inside for it. But he can't show it, because often men from his time were told \"men don't cry, men don't have emotions. Only women do\" so what he feels inside isn't going to show on the outside.\n\nYou made a really distasteful comment, and you can't say you didn't know better or you didn't know his history. Yes he failed as a parent but its not always easy to break cycles, I just hope he didn't treat his kids as his father treated him likely with physical abuse on top of mental, emotional and verbal abuse.\n\nYou owe them ALL an apology (the entire family, MIL, FIL, SIL and your husband and any other of their kids)", "It sounds like the husband was talking to the partner about grief of losing their son vs each other. Not telling the child so saying it would harm the child (which it would) doesn\u2019t apply here. \n\nI can slightly understand through rationality why the husband would feel that way, especially depending on the age of the son. The wife is someone OP chose to fall in love with and be with. Losing a life partner is hard. \nChildren? The younger they are the less of a personality they have to mourn. \n\nOr at least that's what my rational understanding says. My reality of being a mother to a 19 month old wants to shove him off a medium cliff.", "> The man is literally doing as he was taught. \n\nHis dad actually abused his mom as well, so no he did learn to be better when it suited him", "Honestly, it's only been the past 2 decades that as a society we have started to move away from teaching socialized gender roles to children. To stop teaching toxic masculinity to young boys. Being a decent husband to your wife has been a movement for... a century by now I think with the women's rights movements. I mean. It's still a fight that we have today of teaching our children.", "So he watched his mother be abused? Okay still the point I made still works. He is TRYING to break the cycle he's seen full circle. Did he break it fully? No not yet, BUT he is TRYING. Instead of putting everything he's done down, maybe see that yes he's trying. Is it the way you want? no. and it won't be. Because its not YOUR journey. \n\nHe was able to break a part of a likely multi-decade cycle starting with his wife. Which is showing his kids \"This is how you treat a partner. Not like grandpa treated grandma\" \n\nIts also NOT your fight to fight. If anyone is going to fight in this situation it would be your husband or HIS siblings. You are an outsider, also not your circus so not your monkeys.\n\nYou still need to apologize.", "YTA", "Also, even people who like and want children might have issues with a developmental stage.\n\nLike a parent might have loved the toddler and kid phase but can't handle teenagers. Some parents also struggle to transition to a different relationship when their kids become adults.\n\nRelationships are hard!\n\nYta op, don't compare relationships!", "Actually, your husband's the AH and you probably shouldn't have shared this to the internet because what the actual fuck. Who says something like this about their own child and thinks it's normal or acceptable", "You know those comments about child free women changing their minds once they have kids? Well, that does happen but conversely, people who really, really wanted kids can also change their minds.\n\nPlus, there are parents who would be okay with a kid who is closely aligned to them personality wise but might struggle with a kid that's too different.\n\nThis isn't a binary. You might really, really want a kid but end up giving birth to a psycho. It's a role of the dice that doesn't always work out.\n\nSince you are unlikely to know the full inner world of another, be mindful of judgement!"]}
