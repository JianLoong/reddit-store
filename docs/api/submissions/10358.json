My dad had a wolf dog in the city that IIRC was a reasonable percentage of wolf (so not a first Gen cross)  and he actually had the dog trained well enough that he could have it in the group home he ran and let the kids fawn over it. But the damn thing would *not* stay home if dad left, and they were in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Wolf would watch Dad walk down the street and the *instant* that dog did not have eyes on Dad, it was over the fence looking for him and they'd eventually get a call from increasingly exasperated neighbors asking Mr. Jerry to please go get his goddamn dog. Eventually they had to rehome Wolf because it just wasn't safe and they could not get him to stay in the yard if Dad was not at home. Now-a-days it is *illegal* in some states to own and it is highly discouraged to get one if you don't know how to handle one, and like...80% of the time if you know what you're doing you know better than to get one.
