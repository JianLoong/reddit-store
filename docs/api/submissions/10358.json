I showed her pictures from the trip when she asked and they directly contradicted what he was saying. I might be the asshole for not pointing out that he was making a mistake about the country we had gone to before he started talking out his ass about seeing stuff he could not have seen. I do feel bad about it.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He embarrassed himself.", "NTA- LMAO! I know the type. You didn\u2019t embarrass him- he embarrassed himself. And good luck with the girl- you guys are off to a great start.", "NTA. Is he really a friend? Sounds like he was trying to swoop in, and also super immature. Food for thought, are you better off when he is around or not?", "NTA.  Your friend, and I use that word lightly, tried the 'one upmanship' game on this girl and it backfired spectacularly when you wouldn't lie for him.  Spend more time with this new girl and less time with your friend.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand how *you* embarrassed him. Didn't he do that to himself? Also he sounds super annoying and I don't understand why you are friends. If you get anything out of this friendship, I would try talking to him and explain how this side of him makes you (and apparently everyone else) feel.", "NTA, your friend sounds like a pathological liar and he needs a wake up call before his lies make people start to hate him", "The girl at the party sounds like a smart cookie. She had your friend figured out within a few minutes and described him accurately. \n\nWhy do you still hang around him. He sounds insufferable. NTA", "NTA - your friend sounds like a lying insecure idiot.", "NTA. Your friend needs to chill the fuck out. I wonder if you\u2019re game enough to ask him gently if he\u2019s ok and you\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s so competitive about everything. Better yet maybe you should just take a nap and let him fade out of your life. Hahaha yes, do that.", "NTA-you didn\u2019t create the elaborate fake story. \n\nHaving said this, be very careful. You\u2019ve already discussed this \u201cfriend\u201d behind his back with this girl. You two don\u2019t need to discuss him any further. Don\u2019t fall into AH territory as you get to know her. It\u2019s one thing to discuss other friends when asking for advice, but it\u2019s completely another to disparage someone behind their back even if they deserve it. Focus on having the kind of conversation you would have had if your \u201cfriend\u201d hadn\u2019t butted in.  \n\nAs far as a response, all you need to tell your friend is that a) you don\u2019t lie as a matter of principle, and b) you had walked away to get the drinks so you had no idea what he had said. You\u2019re sorry that he was embarrassed, but you couldn\u2019t have known that was coming.", "NTA.  Your friend embarrassed himself by lying.  I hate people like this. There is a Dilbert cartoon about a guy called Topper.  I will see if I can find it.  Anyways your friend is the AH.  He has the need to have a better story than anyone else.  That's just pathetic.", "NTA. But you turn into the company you keep. Get better friends", "NTA\nThats on him", "NTA- Your friend got caught lying and you were not there to hear the beginning of the story.", "NTA. You didn't embarrass him, he embarrassed himself. And she recognized it. Maybe he'll learn his lesson not to lie to try to impress people.", "NTA but maybe bring up with your buddy why he's got to be like this", "The one upper friend...ugh...Idk how these folks have friends.

I hope the woman knew he was lying from the get go and just let him keep on digging himself into a hole.", "INFO:  I'm confused, how coukd she tell by the wedding pictures?", "NTA He sounds like he tries too hard at it which makes him seem desperate and over compensating. If he has to feel like he's done better than anyone else he obviously feels inadequate somewhere whether it's small shoe size or low self esteem most women can tell something is wrong when they have to talk up too much.", "Info: why are you friends with this guy? You know he lies to women and probably everyone all the time. He has a gross attitude and then tried to gaslight you\u2026 so why do you hang out with him?", "NTA.  Friend was correctly diagnosed as a tool, embarrassed himself, and got found out.  None of this is OP's fault.", "NTA but I'd guess your friend is intensely insecure and has social anxiety. Then he connects the dots in the conversation to try and come up with a topic to discuss.", "NTA but you need to start speaking up for yourself. Geesh don\u2019t come on Reddit and tell strangers you don\u2019t like something your \u201cfriend\u201d does. Tell the \u201cfriend\u201d", "NTA but why TF would you hang out with him?", "NTA. You didn't call him out on his lies, and he still managed to embarrass himself. Hopefully he will learn from the shame and not try this stupidity in the future.

Only thing better than this would be if you could have done it sooner and on a bigger scale.", "He tried one upping you to \u201csteal\u201d the girl you were talking to and his own lies made him look stupid. That was just karma. NTA", "NTA.  But chances are your friend's compulsion to lie is not going to get any better.  I'm guessing you are rapidly approaching that age when potential girlfriends will be judging you based on the company you keep.  It's not fair but it is a reality you need to confront.\n\nI know it would annoy me to have to put up with this guy every time we went to a party or social event.", "We had a guy like this when I was in the army. It became a game with everyone else to make up stuff just to see him try to top it. He was clueless.", "Hope so.", "Yea that was a pure AH move. His tall tales just add the cherry on top of this. \nNTA.

This is the way!"]}
