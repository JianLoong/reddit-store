She'd cook, clean, organize, vacuum..etc.\n\n\nYesterday, I was at work and came home and found that she'd done my husband's laundry. I was stunned as I felt this was...not her place nor was it appropriate because for one I always do his laundry and more importantly, I did not think it was appropriatr for her to be looking at his under wear. She downplayed the whole thing saying it was no big deal and that she saw that I was struggling with work and then kids and wanted to help me by doing the laundry. I told her she shouldn't have done it but my husband didn't react and she used that to support her argument saying no one thinks it's a big deal except me. We argued and she shut me down then started crying saying she meant well and was trying to help out. But I couldn't help but think this was not her place.\n\n\nMy husband told me to drop it but I can't shake this weird feeling I got. He told me I should apologize to her for berating her but I refused.", "created_utc": 1667739562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynpam3/aita_for_berating_my_sister_for_doing_my_husbands/", "score": 9685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She does not contribute money but takes on lots of house chores as a way to compensate for it. She'd cook, clean, organize, vacuum..etc.\n\n\nYesterday, I was at work and came home and found that she'd done my husband's laundry. I was stunned as I felt this was...not her place nor was it appropriate because for one I always dk his laundry and more importantly, I did not think it was appropriatr for her to be looking at his under wear. She downplayed the whole thing saying it was no big deal and that she saw that I was struggling with work and then kids and wanted to help me by doing the laundry. I told her she shouldn't have done it but my husband didn't react and she used that to support her argument saying no one thinks it's a big deal except me. We argued and she shut me down then started crying saying she meant well and was trying to help out. But I couldn't help but think this was not her place.\n\n\nMy husband told me to drop it but I can't shake this weird feeling I got. He told me I should apologize to her for berating her but I refused.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I lived with my sister and her husband for a bit. Sometimes I needed the washer and they had their stuff in it, including HIS UNDERWEAR. No one cared.

My husband and I both do laundry, but I probably do it more, because he does other things like vacuuming and putting the bins out.

You need to do some serious reflection and ask yourself why this bothers you so much. Is there a rift in your marriage? Are you worried about something developing between your husband and sister? Are you feeling insecure about your own position and value in the household? Is doing his laundry something you need to do to feel like a good wife?

I even knew what underwear brands they both preferred and sometimes my sister's ex's underwear would randomly make their way into the laundry. I never thought anything of it even when it was my sister's boyfriends. Then again I'm odd in the sense of close friends and family have seen me walking around in my underwear so I don't see it as sexual. Basically everyone in my family will walk around in a t shirt and underwear without a second thought.

I'm not defending traditional gender roles or saying the husband should be helpless or not know how to do laundry. \n\nIt sounds like doing the laundry is typically OP's chore. That could be a symptom of problematic gender roles or it could just be the way they're dividing things. I actually suspect it's the former based on OP being exhausted by childcare despite help from the sister with chores, but that doesn't negate the first part of my comment that it's not inherently bizarre for someone else to do your laundry. Maybe the husband hates laundry or OP hates how he folds clothes but meanwhile he does all the cooking. \n\nSure, maybe it's more common to do 80% of a chore, but it doesn't mean it's problematic to not do it that way as long as the workload is roughly even? Did I miss where someone said the husband has never done a load of laundry in his life or doesn't know how? Did OP say the husband would never be able to do laundry if she was overwhelmed?", "Here's the thing, for me if someone does a certain chore 80% of the time like in your example, I just say they do it, because I'm not looking for some artificial credit for my ego the times I do it. Vice versa as well for the things I do majority of the time.\n\nIt's more of a generalization, not a reference to an exact number. \n\nSo everyone still does a bit of everything in my household however it's still said whoever does a certain things the majority of the time is the one who always does it. Does not mean in any shape or form that certain things aren't known how to be done, or aren't switched up sometimes, and doesn't mean not everyone is contributing equally in the end.\n\nBesides, only info in regards to what OP was asking about is provided which was her reaction about her sister seeing her husband's underwear when touching his laundry which those things aren't relevant to in terms of her reaction to her sister.", "Yep. And that seems reasonable to me!\n\nWorking from home, my husband also did most of the grocery shopping. Because it would interrupt my day, by having to get dressed and drive 20 minutes to the store; whereas he just has to stop on his way home when he\u2019s already driving. \n\nLater on I found misfits market and now all of our groceries get delivered. The only times he has to stop and pick something up is if I get a wild hair up my ass to make Chicken Marsala and I need him to buy some wine for the sauce or something. \n\nNobody complains about the arrangement. \n\nBut this is one of the times that I remember a lot of redditors are 13-20 and don\u2019t understand the give and take in a normal long term relationship. \n\nUsually it\u2019s an equitable relationship. Occasionally someone has to pick up the slack when necessary. \n\nBut it\u2019s rare after ten years that everyone does all of their own laundry and dishes and cooking and just cleans the litter box for HIS cat only.

It's just... a chore.\n\nAnd yeah, you could have special reasons to want to do it a certain way, but that could go for pretty much any chore (which dishes aren't dishwasher safe when you might expect them to be, certain knickknacks that are fragile and you have to be careful about when dusting, a vacuum that's a bit wonky and you have to be careful how you plug it in, whatever.)\n\nEdited to add: I grew up helping my mom with the laundry, which included my dad's underwear and stuff.
