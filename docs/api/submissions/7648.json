Unless she did the same for OP's education, she's stealing from OP's portion. It might be wise to have an accountant go over everything to make sure everything is in order.", "Not really strange. I know here, if there is a trust left, the parent (of a minor child, or in this case the age was deliberately set at 25) is able to withdraw money if they are able to establish that it is going directly to the care and benefit of the child. College education would qualify. There is usually a guardian of the trust that would have to approve it, that is appointed by the state.", "This.

If your action causes your brother to not get as much help as he \\*thought\\* he was going to get, that's not on you, it's entirely on your mom.

It\u2019s your money.", "NTA\n\nNow, having read what others are saying and seeing the difference in ages between you and your brother.... I'm guessing that all of the interest was used to pay for your Uni, and now all of the interest is being used to pay for your brother.  So, while you can ask for your share, if the interest off the shared principle helped cover your expenses, then I see your mother's point.   Your brother might need to dip into principle to cover his eduation (prices have gone up in the last 7 years) so that would make a long term difference.", "NTA.

How is she getting access to it?  What else does she have access to?  Is OP even sure there is still money in her trust?  This last question is what would scare me the most.\n\nI strongly suggest OP contact a lawyer and get to the bottom of this asap.  I am afraid that OP is going to find out that mom accessed her trust fund and drained it - with the excuse of using interest to pay for brother's college. OP needs to get independent documentation and not accept any paperwork/documentation from her mom.

My grandmother left her grandkids each a trust when she died and stipulated that we weren\u2019t allowed to have it until we were 30. However, my mom (as trustee) was allowed to take money out for us early for educational expenses and the like. I think it\u2019s an extra step she added to ensure we were older when we got the money and more likely to not waste it. \n\nEach trust is different but this seems pretty standard to me.
