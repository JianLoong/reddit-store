You signed up for an agreement to live with your friend, not his gf.  If she's living there she should be paying for rent.  Easy", "NTA. When you have a roommate, it's okay to have an occasion overnight guest if that is what you both agreed to. But if a guest is there all the time, that's an imposition of the roomate and inconsiderate.\n\nYou tried to discuss it, and when that didn't work out, you solved the problem by moving out. Makes total sense.", "NTA. As a roommate, he has the right to invite guests within reasonable limits. His girlfriend practically lived with you and her presence has become a burden. You haven't agreed to live with a third person.", "NTA. Looks like a tenant, acts like a tenant.", "NTA I think you dealt with it all very diplomatically, sounds like they were taking the piss and when confronted they didn't like that. Good on you for standing up for yourself and not being taken advantage of.", "ESH\n\nI don't think it's fair to expect her to pay 1/3 considering they're actually sharing a room. But he shouldn't expect her to live there rent-free.", "NTA but usually in my experience a roommate has some lee way for this if your buddy is chasing love. It\u2019s too early for them to move in together. What if you found a girl and were in the same situation? Would you want your friend to support you? But at the same time I get you expected to live with just him and it puts you in an awkward situation at the same time. Depends how close of friends you were I guess.", "INFO:  What does your lease say? Does it grant overnight guests? I had a lease stating no overnight guests for more than 3 nights in a row. By law, in Michigan, staying one night in someone\u2019s house declares residence. They can legally squat until you have the court and sheriff set them out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
