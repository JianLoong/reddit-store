Have you tried actually talking to him?? You blowing off his apologetic comment with a \u201cwhatever\u201d is the exact opposite of communicating. Yes, it\u2019s not great to have to remind your partner of plans. But what you did was  childish and petty. You just wasted hundreds of hours of this persons life because you don\u2019t know how to be an adult. I hope he gets out of this relationship sooner rather than later.", "YTA, and look forward to having no boyfriend to worry about pretty soon", "YTA\n\n>I know what I did was probably not the best thing to do, but I really need him to understand my frustrations\n\nSo then communicate. Even if it takes many fucking times. This is just childish and petty and not cool. You are acting like a toxic mother, not a girlfriend who wants to communicate. \n\nI know you must be very frustrated and I can't blame you. But there is a wrong and right way to go about things, you went the wrong way and it's important you recognise that and own up to it. Work on having more control over you anger and frustration and communicate more with your boyfriend. Doesn't seem like either of you are communicating verbally enough.", "YTA. end of story, you don't have the right to destroy other people's things just because you are upset.", "YTA\n\nYou  are 30 and acting like a child. \n\nI can see why he prefer gaming than investing \"more hours\" in it than in you LOL", "YTA - learn to communicate", "YTA, that was immature. Just leave him", "YTA.  passive aggressive. How did that make him understand your frustrations exactly?? All it did was make him furious w you.", "ESH, but specifically YTA.  Passive Aggressive bullshit like that is a relationship killer.  You say you two are in your late 20s and early 30s, but your entire description of your relationship sounds like you're barely out of highschool.  \n\nGrow up and or break up.", "YTA. I'm sure it's really frustrating having your boyfriend not pull his weight in your opinion but what you've done was pretty harsh and will only make your relationship worse. I would talk about the situation with him again and maybe consider couples therapy if you want to make it work.", "YTA. Soooooo, what did you think would happen? Did you think he would \"understand your frustrations\", smile, grab a cloth and start cleaning? I find that hard to believe.", "YTA cause you didn't even communicate with him. I'd understand something drastic like this if it was a desperate last attemot at making him get something, but you didn't take any of the opportunities to communicate with him about what pisses you off that entire day. You didn't say him you'd rather still go to McDonald's (or somewhere else) together, you didn't ask him if you can spend time together instead of him playing, etc.", "YTA don't destroy shit, especially when it's not yours", "YTA. Even if you apologized for deleting the save, there's no way to get it back. Sure, he didn't go to McDonald's with you but in the end you can go there the next day, or even later the same day if you really wanted to. But to regain the lost progress he's going to have to spend another 100+ hours.\n\nAnd that's if he cares about it anymore. I lost a 100+ hour save once due to a corrupted file and never touched the game again. I lost too much and there was no more investment there.\n\nThis is probably a massive breach of his trust for you. Now he can't leave you with his games without you possibly deleting more of his saves.\n\nThere was also nothing productive about what you did. It was just vindictive and spiteful.", "YTA, because what you did was vindictive and not going to improve your relationship, you went out of your way to hurt him. Just communicate better, and if you're unhappy with him, break up and find somebody that actually makes you happy.", "YTA. Use your words like an adult. You have no right to be judge and jury and punish him. \n\nDeleting something he put hundreds of hours in\u2026 that\u2019s fucked. Hope he breaks up with you.", "YTA. And y\u2019all definitely shouldnt be together. \n\nOne day someone\u2019s going to delete your entire camera roll and I hope you take a moment before getting mad to remember what you did.", "YTA. Destroying something that a partner has been working on for a long time is always going to be a dick move. Doesn't matter what it is.", "YTA. I have hundreds (and in some cases thousands) of hours into certain games. Hey, I\u2019m a childfree adult, no judgement please. I would cry if my wife deleted a save file I had spent that much time on. I\u2019m so tired of this culture of acting like video games aren\u2019t a real hobby worth any respect. Video games are great for problem solving skills, fine motor skills, basic logic, etc. and people act like it\u2019s a waste of time. You destroyed something he loved. That\u2019s not how you deal with problems as an adult and definitely not in a healthy relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t get what you wanted and instead of just leaving him you ruin something of his. I honestly would take my game & leave you. If this was the other way around that man would be painted as controlling & abusive. You were vindictive and what did you accomplish?? Is he spending more time with you now? No, he\u2019s angry.\n\nYou both work and y\u2019all both need to \u201cdestress\u201d\n\nHave you ever thought that gaming was how he destress?", "YTA  How you could do that, then feel the need to ask others if they think you're the A is beyond me!  What you did was mean, vindictive, and cost him the countless hours he's put into working his way through the game.\n\nLook, I empathize as I know some people really become addicted to game playing to the point where it's their number one priority.  However, the way you handled it will only cause anger, resentment and disconnect on his part.  It did nothing to address the problem or find ways to solve it.\n\nYou need to sit down with him and spell out what you feel is wrong in the balance of your relationship.  Set boundaries and compromise as to what is fair and what is non-negotiable.  It may end up that this isn't the right relationship for either of you.  But no doubt, you did the wrong thing.", "Yta\n\nSo i guess if hes unhappy he just gets to destroy your stuff. Sheesh what an asshole", "ESH\n\nIf you are unhappy with your partner, you need to address it like an adult or exit the relationship. What you did makes you worse than him. You aren't going to get more investment in your relationship from this action. I think you know that this was just revenge for hurt feelings.", "YTA, grow up", "YTA and I hope he sees this so he can set himself free.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are an abusive AH.\n\n\", but I really need him to understand my frustrations and he invests more hours into his game than he does us.\" .. HAve you wondered what in your character / behavior makes a computer game more attractive than spending time with you? Even when his saves get destroyed by you?", "YTA full stop. I do not play video games they are not my thing but they are my daughters and they were my late husbands. She used them as her therapy when he died she plays with her late fathers saved characters when she misses him, he died on her birthday by the way, you are a selfish child try constructive talking not destructive petty actions and if you are not happy LEAVE maybe will wake him up but if not you are both better off. You have no idea the time and memories you have just wiped out for him because you are to much of a child to accept an apology and express your needs and concerns like a partner. Grow the f@&k up.", "YTA. I can't imagine why he would prefer a game over spending time with you\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44. I understand you're frustrated but you were way out of line.", "you are an adult. you dont handle adult issues by being a child.  the issues you have with your partner are not about the video game.  they are about him and you and how you deal with each other.  YTA.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA but good news is he will have time to redo his progress when he dumps your ass.", "YTA.  You don't destroy hundreds of hours worth of paintings just because your partner is spending more time on their art hobby than on you.", "I was going to say E S H, but after reading some other comments, I do need to go with YTA.  You two have different interests now, and you should cut your losses and break up with him.  Why stay with him longer, when you're constantly irritated at him?", "Yta. You destroyed personal property.  That's what a game is-personal property.  \n\nI get it- my boyfriend feels more devoted to fishing than the relationship sometimes. But instead of breaking all his rods I tell him,  \"hey,  I need your attention- I'm feeling very lonely.  We need to do x together. \" or \"hey,  I seriously feel neglected and I'm considering leaving our relationship if your hobby is more important.  Do you want to continue a relationship with me or your hobby?\" Literally had to say something yesterday because i needed things done and he was off playing   on the river and he was like,  \"oh.  Sorry. What needs to be done? I'll take care of it tomorrow. \" and because he respects me and wants to be in this relationship he does it. \n\nIf your boyfriend doesn't want to be a partner he needs to say it.  If you need more from your partner you need to say it. Blunt, not yelling but not playing games either. No passive aggressive stuff.  It doesn't work. Say what you need, mean what you say.  If you two can't manage that then you two are more ready to be in a relationship with others.", "This was a crappy and immature way to deal with the situation. You think he\u2019s gonna want to sit and talk things out after you deleted hundreds of hours of his game save? Omg I would never speak to you again.\n\nNow is he right in the situation? Of course not - he\u2019s useless around the house. He understands your frustration, he just doesn\u2019t care. What you SHOULD have done was have a mature conversation with him about his amount of effort, assess the situation, and see if you should break up with him over this. But you were petty and hurt him back. \n\nYTA!", "YTA and you need to fucking grow up.", "YTA - Abusive behavior is not a replacement for communication.", "YTA big time, lady. it\u2019s called bein an ADULT and talking about it, instead of bs like that. i really feel bad for your bf if this how you act over small shit.", "YTA adults use their words. You are a passive aggressive A H.", "YTA. As a gamer I\u2019m livid on his behalf. As a woman I think you\u2019re incredibly childish and petty.", "YTA - what you did is lose his trust. You could have done less destructive things to stop him from playing, hide the controller, hide the power cord, but deleting a saved game is a BIG deal.\n\nI get why you did it, I mean i was the only way he would actually even notice you were there, but I don't think it helped to make him listen to you. I don't think this is the man for you from the sounds of it.", "YTA. That's the equivalent of setting fire to a painting he did or shredding a work project or college thesis. You destroyed something he valued and worked towards. He spent hundreds of hours getting to where he was, and you destroyed his property. I hope he ends the relationship because that kind of behavior is incredibly shitty and abusive.", "ESH.\n\nLook, this relationship is making everyone miserable. Instead of keeping silent, being pissed off, and deleting his game... you should have broken it off with him. If he is unwilling to change and addicted to video games... then why stay with him? \n\nYou were wrong to delete his game instead of deleting the relationship.", "YTA, but I think you need to move on. This man has an addiction and destroying his saves was the equivalent of throwing an alcoholic's booze away. Doesn't solve the problem and just makes them mad.", "YTA he needs to break it off with you. You all are definitely not compatible.", "YTA. Why are you in this relationship if he makes you miserable? Wiping his files makes you immature.", "BIG YTA. As someone who has just recently started playing video games I see it from both sides. Yes it\u2019s very frustrating to feel like your partner never wants to spend time on the relationship, only on games. Before I played, all those hours seemed like a complete waste of time and a life. But now that do play, I understand why people do. It\u2019s entertaining and can help distress. It really is fun. And I am 45 and have only been playing for 4 years. I am a woman and I still love it. It\u2019s not easy to get all the loot, gear and levels. It\u2019s very frustrating. That type of behavior would make me end a relationship. If you really feel the need to stop his game, the more appropriate way would be save the game and exit. That will piss a gamer off but do much less damage to your relationship. In my opinion what you need to do is set a time with your boyfriend to talk about your relationship and your expectations going forward. His hobby is gaming. You will have to accept that and understand he will demand, and rightly so, that he has X amount of hours each week of gaming. If someone was into art, would you destroy a drawing or painting out of petty spit? If your answer is no then you need to understand that gaming is on the same level with your boyfriend! And he needs to understand that you need time with him as well. Good luck and hopefully you can talk this through.", "YTA\n\nYou destroyed hours of his life, if your not happy about this relationship you either learn how to better communicate or break up. Imagine if he destroyed something your passionate about, how would that make you feel? Would he be justified because you did something to upset him?", "YTA\u2014 you know you can literally just leave? Like, girl, you can definitely find someone who is a better fit as a partner. Instead of trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole and making yourself and him miserable in the process, just leave. Like, he sucks but omg you\u2019re toxic.", "YTA. If the relationship is this frustrating to you then leave. You don't have to destroy something he cares about.", "It's not even a question if YTA. You definitely are TA for what you did. I understand why you did what you did. You as  GF want BF to be more available and present. You have to communicate these things to him. Let him know that you feel unappreciated when he spends the majority of his time playing games. That would be like him feeling like you spend to much time at the gym and just cancelling your gym membership without your approval. That is basically what you did when you deleted his game. You 100% owe him an apology. He needs to be more present with you. You are both at fault in this situation, but more so you, because i want to believe that when you two started dating he was playing video games, so it's not like it's anything new for you.", "100% YTA. This is *abusive*. You destroyed his property out of anger. This is the same as him taking your phone, destroying your clothes, or him destroying your inhaler. This is fucked up. Use your big girl words.", "Yes of course YTA", "YTA", "YTA, also insane", "YTA. You are acting like a spoiled brat.", "YTA. That's digital theft. Use your fucking words!", "Yeah he might have some issues but what you did was 100% toxic as fuck", "Somewhere between YTA and ESH, you both need to learn to communicate, or just break up.", "Girl. Did you really think THAT would make him understand? So childish.", "YTA, big time. How about communicating next time (if he even gives your toxic ass another chance) that you were looking forward to going out before destroying his stuff? Yeah you didn\u2019t physically destroy it, but you deleted something he really cares about.", "You really thought deleting his game is gonna make him spend more time with you? Hes gonna end up gaming even more to make up for what you did. YTA and you need to learn to communicate or just dump him. Never take your anger out on property that\u2019s not yours", "Yes YTA. Your boyfriend has put 100 hours into something and it took you seconds to destroy it. Imagine if you had spent that many hours on something you loved and he smashed it to bits. You'd be pissed off. If my husband deleted all of my game saves he'd be sleeping at his moms house especially if it was because we didn't eat McDonald's in the restaurant.", "YTA and you know it. I'm a girl gamer and if you did that to me, you'd be out on your ear Hun.", "YTA. She didn't even voice out that she was pissed (just acted that way), boyfriend still gets the cue, apologizes and she deletes his files. There were several ways to do this: talk with him in a scheduled meeting, come up together with a cleaning plan, plan out time slots for couple time - but OP woke up this day and chose violence. Someone has once accidentally deleted my gaming files without asking me and I was so furious, don't get me started on someone intentionally and maliciously deleting it. Yeah, you are going to be very soon an ex-girlfriend.", "YTA. You're a terrible communicator.\n\nYou're abusive. He wasn't doing what you wanted, so you destroyed something he cares about.\n\nIn the face of that, literally nothing else you said matters to me. You're an abuser and he should leave you before you escalate it anymore.", "YTA try talking to people and don\u2019t just destroy peoples belongings", "YTA. If you can\u2019t communicate, and act, like an adult, then you aren\u2019t ready for an adult relationship.", "YTA. You and your boyfriend need to act like adults and have adult conversations. \n\nSounds also like your boyfriend has a habit, and he sounds frustrating. This is not an excuse to break his things.", "YTA", "YTA. Why are you with him if you\u2019re going to treat him so horribly? Shit happens, you had a misunderstanding about a burger, that\u2019s no reason to destroy hundreds of hours of work. I hope he comes to his senses and finds someone who isn\u2019t so abusive towards him. You need to be irk on yourself.", "YTA. That was a very passive aggressive move.", "YTA. As a gamer married to a gamer, losing a save is devastating and irreplaceable. If you\u2019re so unhappy, end the relationship. You\u2019ve destroyed something important to him because you\u2019re (rightly so) frustrated - but this is not the correct action. \n\nIf my game was deleted out of spite, that would be the end of my relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou could have held the controllers hostage, or the power plug, or the game console.\nYou instead irreparably ruined all his time investment.\n\nDo I think his disengagement gets a pass? No, but this was in no way how to handle it. Unless you want him to dump you, instead of working things out. Because (having dated that guy and had that same frustration) I'd be dumping you if you did that to me. And we'd be reading any kid in our house that did that to a sibling the riot act.", "YTA", "YTA. If he didn't spend enough time with you before, why would he even want to now? What a dick move.", "Y\u2019all are too damn old to be so petty and childish. ESH", "ESH\n\nHim neglecting you for his hobby is not ok, and needs to be corrected, but you just destroyed something he invested hundreds of hours into.\n\nIt's not just a game save, it's something he's investing time in building. Imagine if his hobby was pottery, and due to feeling neglected you walked into his work area with a sock full of padlocks and just started spinning, destroying the result of something he invested a lot of time and effort into. It's not really different.\n\nYou have every right to be pissed off at the way he's treating you. Neglect is not ok. But it sounds like you took it a step too far.", "obviously YTA", ">he it\u2019s no big deal whether we eat there or at home\n\nLet me guess: That's not true. He in fact DID NOT want to eat there. It WAS a big deal that he could eat at home instead.", "ESH - he sounds like he needs to grow up and start pulling his weight, but deleting his saved games was a dick move. You need to have a grown up conversation about what each of your expectations are, and if you can\u2019t do that then it isn\u2019t going to work out long term between you.

I didn't even need to read past the first paragraph, but for what it's worth, I did.\n\nYour boyfriend cares more about his game than you. You've tried talking to him and it didn't work. Did you think that destroying his property was going to be a magical solution and all of the sudden he's going to respect you and pay attention to you? \n\nYou both need to either invest in couples counseling, or admit to yourselves that the relationship is over", "ESH. You shouldn't have done that. What you should do is leave your deadbeat boyfriend.", "I mean technically ESH but I really don't think you understand the gravity what you have done.\n\nPlaying a game for that long, you put your soul into it. \n\nIts may be hard for you to empathise with, and some people may disagree because they just look down on gamers and think its childish, but for him its like if he put that much time into a painting or writing a book and you destroyed it. He was a part of that games story and you took that from him.\n\nYes he should pull his weight around the house, and not have been a dick about McDonald's. Its perfectly possible, I love gaming and I manage.\n\nHowever I'm imagining someone deleting my Mass Effect series saves and I would be devastated. \n\nYou should have broken up with him, or told him you would if break up he didn't sort himself out.\n\nThis was just so uncaring and authoritarian.", "ESH. You are both grown adults and should know how to communicate effectively about your relationship.

I don't blame your frustrations, but your course of action is only going to lead to more resentment and no actual solutions. It's time to ask yourself if this is worth it.", "Definitely ESH.\n\nYou: This was a petty and childish thing to do. Not at all the behaviour of a 30 year old. He invested a lot of time and effort in this, he clearly cared about it, and you knew this. Frustration about his behaviour does not entitle you to destroy the things he cares about.\n\nHim: He is also behaving like a child. He should not be neglecting you, especially given that you have tried to have adult conversations about his neglect. Beyond his neglect, he should absolutely not be pushing household obligations on you to play a video game.\n\nIt sounds like you guys need some couples therapy or counselling and it is worthwhile to examine his dependency on the game. This sounds more than just a hobby, he may have a gaming addiction or there is something else going on (such as a mental health problem, stress, and so forth) that is pushing him to put more time into the game instead of the rest of his life. This is especially true if this is behaviour that is not typical of him.\n\nWhile I think your behaviour was childish, I don't completely blame you for lashing out so long as you learn from this experience and try to do something productive to heal your relationship. But similarly, if there really is something going on in your bf's life which is causing his dependency, I don't think he is entirely morally blameworthy for his conduct either. Good luck trying to patch things up.", "Can I go with ESH?

What may seem silly or insignificant to one person is the world to another, or as they say - one man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.  You destroyed something of his, tangible or not, that is not how you deal with problems.\n\nBoyfriend absolutely should be aware of his addiction and how it\u2019s affecting those around him.  Maybe he needs help or a wake up call, but you have every right to have an invested partner.", "ESH. You both are behaving beyond juvenile for how old you are. He isn\u2019t responding like an adult but that doesn\u2019t mean you stoop down to his level. It means you get serious and lay down real boundaries and real bottom lines. It would be completely on him to ignore that but, unfortunately, you did something that will fix literally NONE of the problem.", "ESH.  You\u2019ve tried talking to him.  He just doesn\u2019t care.

Without ever having played games, especially with the modern consoles (I was a kid when the Nintendo came out) there doesn\u2019t appear to have any value to it. You can\u2019t display it on the wall like art or puzzles, there\u2019s no useful quality like crocheted blankets. I crocheted a blanket and matching toilet paper holder in February of 2021. I was very proud of myself and I should be. Gaming isn\u2019t a music record you can play a thousand times. It looks like a complete waste of time because there\u2019s no apparent value on it. \n\nHowever I have discovered what games actually are:entertainment on on less visible medium. People that play online actually acquire friends they might never meet but very much enjoys talking to with a very common interest. Gaming is completely gender neutral. It doesn\u2019t matter the sex of the person playing in any way, shape or form, it only matters your interest in the type of games which are as diverse as there is categories. You level up and earn points, gear, abilities and trophies. If you don\u2019t play online you get the same just not for a wide range of people to see but just as satisfying. It\u2019s your own personal victories on line or off line. \n\nI personally told anyone I got into a conversation with about video games that you all needed to grow up and become an adult. I literally said it for 20 years. I now have to eat my words, often daily on the weeks I can play daily. Everyone that\u2019s gone on the type of rants I went on is as wrong as I always was. Anyone who sees no value in the games are looking at it the same way any biased or bigoted or sexist looks at anything. We don\u2019t stop and look at what it is and why someone enjoys it. It\u2019s as useful as Art, literature and any healthy hobby. There are even people who make money playing the games. But for people who don\u2019t try to understand it, we hold the same wrong opinion that some of the uneducated hold for college degree\u2019s from a simple lack of trying to understand! \n\nIt is just as wrong to erase his saves as it is for anyone to destroy crocheting or art or any other hobby or professional work!", "While I see your point, and agree to a certain extent, crocheting is an activity that doesn't consume all of the crocheter's attention.

A woodworking project produces value once completed. It can be considered art or just be something functional (cabinet, table...). A saved game does not yield the same value as something physical. Unless you can sell game saves (which I think is not the case this time).\n\nCleaning and organizing the apartment is something I would consider work, at the end of it, there is a benefit (clean apartment). And it is something he not doing, but also undoing by living there and not helping out. She might be seeing the BF as undoing the cleaning she does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do agree it is childish and vindictive to delete the saves, but they need to figure out how to share responsibilities.", "Well, you don't need to do anything. But it's pretty clear you have some trauma.", "Everything you described is symptoms of PTSD.", "It happening by random accident is completely different than someone intentionally causing it. If a piece of hail dents my car, no big deal, but if my wife goes outside and hits my car with a hammer because she feels like I am not taking the trash out enough, that is a completely different scenario.", "what if the boyfriend draws digitally? even if they\u2019re terrible drawings with no functionality or arguable selling capacity? or if he journals? there are also a lot of useless physical hobbies. what if the boyfriend likes to collect nail polish (which no longer holds monetary value upon first opening). could be a number of things. the point is that she messed with something he cherished, and we\u2019re not in the place to say that it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to him. the situation should be treated the same regardless of what it is because it\u2019s something he genuinely cares about", "No. That is low grade shitty stuff. Life happens and we \nmove on.", "It\u2019s not trauma. It\u2019s life.", "No. What I have is a reaction to a shorty situation. Same as if you get cheated on and then struggle a bit. It\u2019s not ptsd. It\u2019s life and occ shitiness. We don\u2019t need to label everything that is uncomfortable s", "I'm sure that you don't neglect your wife either. And if she comes to you and tries to communicate with you that you are hurting her in some way, you listen to her. I've been in the position of being nice, nice, and then after an exhausting effort I'm still ignored. I don't agree with how Op handled it, but he is an asshole too."]}
