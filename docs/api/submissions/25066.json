Obviously college kids can unpack and decorate themselves and she would if anything happened to her parents. It was about your wife spending more time with her before she stays at college. I feel you ruined the experience.", "YTA. Why would you ruin your daughter\u2019s send off? Helping her decorate is standard kid college drop off stuff. A trip to Target for essentials, a mini-fridge, some groceries, etc. Your wife wanted to help. Who are you to judge? Do you have trouble when you\u2019re not the center of attention? It sure sounds like it. Try shelving your main character energy for a moment and learn to be supportive.", "YTA - they are right, you ruined a nice time. Her memory of starting college will forever be her dad insulting her", "YTA. This wasn't about her *needing* help. They were bonding. They were spending time together and enjoying each other's company. You sat on your butt in the other room instead of participating, then intentionally spoiled things for them. That sucks. If your wife didn't want to help, she would have ducked out earlier. She enjoyed being with her daughter and being a part of her new life.", "YTA obviously your daughter could decorate herself, your wife WANTED to help her because it\u2019s fun and they\u2019re spending time together, and her daughter is leaving the nest. Couldn\u2019t you have just sat there on your phone and been quiet like a normal dad", "YTA. Your wife was parenting because she loves her daughter. Maybe you should try it.", "This was part of the process of your daughter's transition to college. Had nothing to do with being needy. Kind of like a final thing for them to share. And you ruined it. YTA", "Oh, holy crow! You took a bonding moment, one of your daughter's firsts, and blew it out of the water because your fee fees were hurt from not being the center of attention. That was a great way to show, and tell, your daughter that she's only important when it's convenient for you.\n\nThis wasn't a time that your wife was decorating because your daughter couldn't, it was a time for them to share as a right of passage - daughter's first place (her dorm room), being semi on her own, growing into womanhood and making her own decisions while getting her education. And you turned it into...okay, so we're here, your stuff is here, it's been an hour, why are you still needing your mom to unpack, wife get in the car let's go. Yes, YTA of epic proportions.\n\nBTW you do realize SHE will most likely be the one picking your nursing home, right? Don't worry, your wife will be living with her and her family.", "YTA. \n\nIt is very clear that your wife *wanted* to help decorate. Of course your daughter *could* do it on her own. It's hard for most kids to go away from home for the first time as a new adult, and it's hard for *most* parents--but apparently not you--to leave them there. Your wife clearly feels that way, and wanted to spend that extra time with your daughter, setting up the space where she's going to live and talking with her. Your reactions, particularly asking her daughter what she would do if you or her mother died, were way out of line, and you spoiled what should have been a happy, if bittersweet, moment. \n\n Your daughter's behavior was fine. Yours, however, is concerning. You don't seem to empathize with your daughter or wife at all, or to miss your daughter now that she's moved away.", "YTA. What you don\u2019t seem to understand is being a parent is a job you hold for a lifetime. You and your wife have life experience that your kids could greatly benefit from and you should want them to learn from you rather than leaving them to figure it out for themselves. Your daughter knows nothing about setting up a new place, but your wife does which is why your wife stuck around to help her. It\u2019s not like your daughter left the apartment and your wife had to set things up by herself. They were doing it together. You\u2019re correct that the time will come when you won\u2019t be around to help out but that day isn\u2019t today so help guide your kids through life while you\u2019re still able to do it.", "YTA, when I was 25 and moving into a new apartment I didn't NEED my mom's help, but I still appreciated and loved that she came to help and take me shopping for things like food and cleaning supplies etc. It was a bonding moment.\nYour daughter wasn't being needy, your wife was helping her and supporting like a good parent. Going off to college can be scary and having a parent help move, unpack, decorate, etc can help ease some of the nerves and provides a good time to bond and be with each other for what may be several months (depending on how close you are to home). You ruined a perfectly normal and good time with your needy comment.", "YTA your wife wants to help your daughter to move in apartment. Her child is grown up and move out she might feel lose and don't know what to do next since there is no children at home for her to care anymore.", "YTA setting up your dorm room or your first apartment at college? When you don\u2019t have a SO or someone you know as a roommate, it\u2019s really normal to do that with your parents. Especially when they are about to drive off and you are living alone for the first time. Those extra minutes deciding where to put up a poster or arranging cooking supplies?  Really precious. \n\nAnd that\u2019s coming from someone who had a super contentious relationship with her parents as a teenager. It still was really hard that first night to heat up leftovers from the lunch my dad had brought over and then eat alone. My mom told me later that when she called to check if I was settled in/ready for classes she hung up and turned to see my dad who I\u2019ve never seen cry except when he lost immediate family sitting there crying silently. Because it\u2019s a big deal when you and your kids make this transition!  \n\nYou seem really uninterested in your kids and like you aren\u2019t going to miss her or don\u2019t care whether she struggles or not. Helping set up the apartment isnt coddling. It\u2019s supportive and bonding behavior.", "If you don\u2019t want to be there for your daughter just say that. YTA", "YTA do you even like your wife and daughter?", "Your wife and daughter shared a beautiful moment and a wonderful memory \n\nThe sad part of it all is you could have been a part of it\n\nBut instead, you chose to act like someone who knocks over a Lego town because only babies do stuff like that \n\nYTA", "INFO were you planning on just dipping out of your kids' lives?", "YTA - Your daughter just moved out. She is nervous as she is now going to be on her own to an extent in an unfamiliar place. Helping to unpack and decorate is a common thing for mothers to do, particularly with their daughters, and more important than that, she wanted to help her daughter. This was an emotional day and bonding experience for them, but you pooped all over it by telling your daughter to grow up. How about you grow up and allow people to have their emotions, instead of being robots like you?", "YTA. I would hope your wife would help your daughter move into college and decorate. It\u2019s very common for mothers to help their daughters in that way. I\u2019m in college and I don\u2019t know any girl who didn\u2019t have their mom help them like that! It can be a special bonding moment. I think it\u2019s lovely that they wanted to do that together. \n\nShe\u2019s 19. There\u2019s plenty of time for her to learn independence.", "YTA. Seems like you could hardly wait to drop off your daughter and leave her. I guess it was nice of you to help her move in. Too bad you had to cap it off with, you or her mom might die or something, so she better get used to life without you.", "YTA. Do you even like your family? Because unless you start acting like it, you\u2019ll always be the grumpy man on the sidelines.", "Wow YTA do you hate your daughter?", "YTA, your wife wanted to help. It\u2019s part of the process, setting your kid up in their dorm/apartment. Ever think about why you were the unwanted person here?", "YTA. It was a bonding moment that you could have been involved in, but instead you ruined the moment. \n\n\nThis is her first time living away from you guys and this is going to be an exciting but scary time. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is the beginning of the end of whatever relationship you guys have.", "Yta.. also I bet you were just waiting for this day\n To have no more kid in house? \nAll about this post is your crying about because wife wanted to help daughter move in properly.", "YTA - why are you so quick to get rid of your kid?", "YTA Why wouldn\u2019t you want to spend time with your kid and help them? Do you even like your daughter? You ruined that moment and time for everyone. Why should your daughter invite or include you ever again, when you\u2019ve shown her you don\u2019t want to be with her? Your presence in your daughter\u2019s life, ever again, will not be necessary. It\u2019s unlikely \n\nWhy should she have to be alone if she doesn\u2019t need to be? How is denying her your help and presence while you are alive going to prepare her for when you\u2019re gone? So she can practice being alone? At this point, if you died, she\u2019ll just shrug and say \u2018he didn\u2019t want to be around anyways so this isn\u2019t any different\u2019, and go back to her day.", "YTA I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my dad", "YTA. Yes, young adults need to develop their independence, but the very first day your kid moves out of home is hardly the time to get in her face about it. There\u2019s nothing unusually needy in what happened here - nothing unusual at all, except a father who\u2019s unusually impatient and decided to be unkind on what should have been a happy, exciting day for his daughter.", "Info:  All I see is your wife deciding to help her and not where the daughter is being 'needy'.", "YTA.  Imaging being so self centered that you don't see that your wife needs time with your daughter too and so gross that you say something that ugly to your own child right before their audition when you're getting ready to head back home.  Is this for real?\n\nYeah, maybe next time don't come.  I have 3 in college.  I hope this is fake because any parent with a quarter of a brain and even a smidge of empathy would have been able to avoid showing their whole ass like you did.  Wow", "YTA, big time. When I moved out, I felt bad about my mother being there and helping so much, I told her it wasn't necessary and I could do it myself, but she kept finding more and more excuses to keep at it. Your wife wasn't doing if for your daughter, your wife was doing it for herself, she wasn't ready for your daughter to leave the nest.", "YTA   What a horrible and heartless dad you are. Do you even love your daughter? Where the hell is your empathy and compassion?", "YTA. One of my happiest memories is of my mom, dad and my maternal grandparents, who were all so excited for me to enter this new phase of my life, wanting to help set up my dorm room & later my apartment when I went to grad school. They didn\u2019t do this because I was a helpless damsel, but because it gave them joy to spend this extra time with me, to know they had a hand in making sure I was set up for success, safe and secure. Think of it like this\u2026it\u2019s like when you would make sure your daughter was securely tucked in bed as a wee slip of a girl. It made your heart warm & full of love.  You could have been a welcome part of this moment and memory being made. Instead you were Modern Family\u2019s Jay in the episode where he was initially happy no one wanted him to do anything. Later he felt the loss of being included and decided to join in painting Joe\u2019s room. Unlike you who stayed divorced from positive emotions & family bonding.\n\nYour daughter won\u2019t be needy or helpless without the guidance of her parents. You were heartless and hurt your wife and daughter deeply with your words and actions.\n\nAre you a tin man in need of a heart? I hear they have one in Emerald City. Just follow the yellow brick road. Then take a good hard look in the mirror before you go apologize to your wife and daughter.", "Yeah YTA. \nGosh it reminds me of your generation so much- mum helping and being present and dad getting shitty she\u2019s doing to much and preventing her. \nOne day you will be dead you don\u2019t have to prepare her for it. Just be present in every way you can it was a special moment in her life, your wife was being present for and you wrecked it.", "Boooo OP, boooo. YTA. Goddamn", "Absolutely Yta. Let mom help if she wants to. My husband once told his mother that if she leaves us first, he would probably not bother with his father. Think about it.", "YTA- even grown adults who are friends or family help each other move and unpack in a new home. I have done that. It\u2019s not about \u201cneeding.\u201d You seem to be hung up on that. They were enjoying themselves doing this together and spending time setting up your daughters first apartment. You ruined it for no good reason and told her she should have acted like you and your wife were dead already, yeesh!", "YTA, the issue is your lack of patience.", "YTA. This was a bonding experience at a significant time in her life that also comes with a lot of change. Your daughter was making a special memory with her mother and you ruined it.", "YTA. It seems to me your wife and daughter just wanted to spend time together. What is so terrible about that?", "YTA. Do you even love your daughter? Are small gestures like these considered too much?", "YTA. What was even the point of even saying that? Why be bothered that your wife wanted to spend as much time with your daughter as possible before the opportunities to do so become less and less frequent. Don\u2019t you care about that at all?", "\"What would she do if something happened to either of her parents?\" \n\nHmm, if something happened to you, she'd probably heave a sigh of relief for not having to deal with your emotionally constipated, socially inept self anymore.  Her mother, the person who took time to help her do small things when she didn't need to , and who showed her she loved her, she'd likely be very sad. \n\nYTA. What exactly is wrong with you?", "So you dropped your kid off to college, sit and mopped while they got set up and then asked her supposed you both died what would she do? \n\nWhy did you even go???\n\nWhy didn't you stay home and let your wife go and get her set up if it was such a waste of your precious time? You sound like you wanted to twist the knife to make sure she knows not to come back home. Were you trying to make her understand that you're done with her and you no longer want to be her parent that she can call on for assistance?", "She is not needy ffs, her mother couldn't just \"let her go\" that day. You have a heart of stone, it seems.", "YTA. I would kill to have a mom like your wife because I sure as heck never got any of that. This was a special bonding moment for your wife and daughter because she\u2019s out of the house and your wife wanted to spend a little more time with her. If not being the center of attention affects you that much you should\u2019ve just stayed home and threw your little temper tantrum there. Also, I guess she can live with out you with how much of a prick you are.", "YTA. Let them bond. Or even better, get in on the love.", "YTA. It has nothing to do with being needy, and everything to do with the bond between your wife and your daughter. Did you even bother to find out if your daughter asked her mother to help, or whether it was something your wife AS HER MOTHER volunteered to do? Your wife might not have been quite ready to let her child go yet and wanted to do a few last things that would allow her to spend a little more time with her daughter. I'm sure your daughter was capable of unpacking and decorating herself - but unlike you, she saw that her mother WANTED to do it.

It isnt her doing something by herself, its the act of us bonding and fulfilling a maternal need in me.

Your wife probably needed that hour with her daughter.

It\u2019s a memory. Sure she could do it herself but it\u2019s a nice memory to look back on. Instead you said hey imagine if we die. When I was your daughters age my mum got diagnosed with cancer 10 days before I moved out for college, she had surgery 3 days before the move and yep you guessed it, my single mum didn\u2019t get to move her only child out of home, I got to do that by myself. 5 years later when I was 23 my mum died from cancer. Oh and she died 7 years ago today. I know I have a hell of a lot better memories with my mum then you daughter will have with you and that breaks my heart for your daughter. At least she will have found memories of mum to look back on, especially if you die first, but I wouldn\u2019t hold out hope for a moving speech at your funeral.\nAnd by the way, moving myself out of home in no way shape or form prepared me for losing my mum at 23, nor did the \u2018tough\u2019 love I received from an abusive grandparent in my childhood.

She\u2019s been gone ten years this Christmas season. If I could have known I only got to have 22 years with my mom, I would have been the neediest person ever. Your daughter has her entire life to do things on her own. Let her ask for Mom\u2019s help as long as she wants it and wife is capable. And maybe if you had been in there actually helping wife and daughter rather than waiting in the living room, you would have beautiful memories and a better bond with your daughter.

It sounds like your wife is the one that did all the emotional and parenting labour for you kids, so they are more attached to her, which is healthy by the way. No one was forcing your wife to do things for your kids, and she was happy to help, so why did you feel the need to ruin it for your daughter and scold her? It feels like you are jealous of your kids because your wife pays attention to them, and instead of keeping yourself in check, or trying to improve you relationship with your kids of your wife, you resort to being mean. Your wife telling you she wishes you hadn't come also speaks volumes to her having picked up on you acting like a spoiled kid, and not being very happy with you.", "YTA. What was so important that you needed to get home for? My dad used to act like this when he wanted to get home to drink. We have a very strained relationship. Get therapy, or at least rethink your priorities. \n\nCollege is already fucking scary for your daughter because she's taking her first big steps towards independence, and you're throwing her in the deep end asking how she'd cope if you fucking /died/ instead of helping to ease the transition so that she can feel confident in stepping out on her own. All you'll do is make her anxious and fearful.", "YTA.\n\nYou were really mean to her considering the circumstances. How is it needy to ask for help decorating her apartment?

You\u2019re treating it like a chore and a burden, but she\u2019s your child why don\u2019t you WANT to help? Did you expect your kids to be out of the house at 18 and to just get on with it, and for them only contact you on holidays or something?", "YTA.

You got real issues, sir. I just don't see how you didn't recognize that this was not going to add anything good to the experience that you were having with them. Is she attending college out of state? I really hope not, because that makes this drop off even worse. I hope that looking back on it, you can understand that your comments and entire attitude that day were insensitive and unnecessary. Sometimes silence is okay.", "YTA\n\nFrom what you said seems like your wife insisted on being included and you got upset over not being babied enough in that moment and went after your daughter.

That\u2019s it Judy done never have to worry about her again right? You were a complete and utter ass. You owe not only your wife an apology, but you owe your daughter, a massive apology. Because what you did, what you said to your daughter, not only ruined the experience on what was a mile stone day, but probably shook her. Trust in you that you would be there when she needs you. Yeah she may be a young adult, but she has no real life experience. She\u2019s just a kid in college.

She CAN decorate the room by herself but did it ever occur that your mom and daughter might ENJOY to do it together? Maby even with your help? Not because its so difficult or complicated but because they find it a nice thing to do together For the very reason that you brought up: sooner or later you and or your wife will die and this - moving out - actually is a milestone that both your mom and daughter wanted to enjoy together, with a memory to cherish that might last forever.\n\nRandom simple things like decorating a room together can create deeper and better memories than the fanciest holidays to Disney land or whatever.

This was probably a mother daughter bonding experience for them, especially if this is her freshman year and first time moving away from home. WHY choose that moment as the example of why she needs to stop being so needy? So lets break this down... you say she is being needy because her mom helps her decorate. Are you suggesting that if her mom didn't help the decorations would have all stayed in the boxes and she never would have decorated her room? That she actually NEEDED the help decorating? Because the way you are trying to justify your YTA behavior right now is by saying you want to teach her a lesson about not being so needy so she can take care of herself. So what about this moment of them decorating together rang those bells in your head that you need to teach her that lesson? Yeah exactly... she didn't need her mom to decorate... they just wanted to do it together... you are just reaching for a way to justify your behavior. So what is the real reason you said that?", "YTA - she wasn\u2019t being needy they were creating core memories that you\u2019ve now ruined with your bs.

It was about your daughter and wife. Your wife sounds like she is going to miss your daughter a lot while staying at college and probably vice versa. In comparison to you,  you should recognise this.

Where as I think its the opposite for your daughter from what you have written.\n\nI agree with you that everyone has to learn to do things on their own. Maybe decorating the room would have given your daughter something to do while she settles in the dorm etc...but it was a last bonding session or moment for the rest of your family. Sometimes, just keeping your mouth shut and then discussing things like this with your wife at home (not arguing) is the best form of action. Worded something like...\"Do you think our daughter will be OK on her own? - I cant help but notice she seems aprenhensive to leave us, which is totally understandable. Will you be OK too?\" \n\nThat would have sufficed and given you a greater understanding of their relationship and feelings.\n\nYour not an Asshole....just still learning my man.

Maybe go visit your daughter on yiur own, take her for some food and things for her dorm to help her understand you do care and most importantly.

You don\u2019t even sound like you are going to miss your daughter! Which I\u2019m positive she picked up on and is a shitty feeling\n\n4.

I agree that young adults should do things for themselves, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t help them. \n\nHelping her unpack and decorate could have been a wonderful family moment between the three of you and instead you sound annoyed that you had to spend time with your wife and daughter.", "YTA \n\nAnd a shit father. Just because your kids grow up doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need you. What you are implying is that they are keeping you from living your best life. \n\nYou better pull your head out of your ass before she leaves you or your kids disown you.

My parents dropped me off with my boxes and left. I barely had a made bed by the end of the day bc I didn't know how to move in somewhere new by myself. I laid in my bare room alone feeling scared and lonely that very first night. For contrast my roommates side was perfection.  Matching in every way and so nicely decorated, nicer that nay place I have ever lived. My side looked like a prison. \n\nThere was no reason for you to be so impatient to dump your daughter off at school and to basically put in her mind the idea of her parents dying when she's about to spend her first night on campus away from home ever if fucking horrid.", "INFO: Is this your step daughter from your wife's previous relationship?", "YTA.

Your wife wanted to spend some quality time with her and you ruined it.", "YTA. Do you love your daughter? Hell, do you even like her? Dropping off your kid at college is an emotional moment, why does it piss you off that your wife wants to spend time with your kid?", "When I went to university at nearly 19 my parents drove me, helped me carry all my stuff to my room, said goodbye and left. Other parents did as your wife did and helped unpack, bought dinner for their kids and valued the time together. I cried that night, not because I couldn\u2019t unpack, decorate and feed myself, of course I could I was an adult. I cried because finding out and being a part of my new life in any small way wasn\u2019t important enough to my parents.

They were having a great time together, probably their lasts hours together in the next months, and you ruined it for them. She is not needy, she just likes her time with her mum.

Did you feel left appart while they were bonding? You could have helped instead of waiting in the living room. You could have gone fetch them some coffee and a piece of cake, to celebrate. I think the needy one in this story it's you.", "YTA.

This wasn't about unpacking and decorating. Your wife and daughter were bonding and making memories. As your daughter gets older and navigates her own life with school, friends, activities, career, and her own family there will be less opportunities to spend with each other. Your wife sounds like a wonderful mother and a Saint ( based on long years of marriage to you). Your words were harsh, rude and unnecessary.

Your wife needed that \"closure\" to be able to let your daughter fly from the nest into the world of being a grownup and going to UNI. Hopefully you can sit down and say sorry to your wife, and communicate how you were feeling (without attacking her) and then she can explain how she was feeling. There are many different relationships with a partner and children (and many different stages throughout their growing years). This is a stage where your wife and your daughter are finding their new norm. They needed that day together, hopefully you will be able to see that they needed a way to let go of each other, and move onto another stage of their relationship", "YTA\n\nI'm guessing your daughter has never lived alone or apart from you before?

Guess what? over a decade later and I was there for them when they were both diagnosed with cancer. I paid bills, I did shopping, I took them to their appointments. \n\nYou only seem to care about yourself - remember than when it's you facing a daunting change to your life and you get back what you've put into this relationship - nothing.", "Seriously?

Could it be plausible that it isn't about your kid being needy but your wife having trouble letting go and say goodbye? Because No where in this did you mention your kid asking for help to unpack or decorate, however you mention being told by your wife this is what she is doing and her being teary eyed when saying goodby.  \n\nWhen I moved out for college, the hardest part wasn't actually living alone, but when it came time to say goodbye and know that they were living 6 hours away. My mom was having just as much trouble saying goodbye, especially with my being the youngest. \n\nAnd even if your daughter asked for help, is it really needy to have trouble saying goodbye to your parents the first time moving out? The fact that you put a clock on when you would be done is wrong, especially since your wife clearly didn't agree.

Just because he's been told that needing your parents is bad doesn't mean he gets to ruin his daughter the same way he was ruined", "Exactly.  I also read this as OP having a problem with his wife not hurrying back to him.  The daughter\u2019s presence is probably getting in the way of his dinner plans.

I don't necessarily disagree with you, but you could have handled it a lot better.

You could have watched TV, read, or just doomscrolled. You could have taken a nice walk around the new neighborhood and scoped out a cafe or bookstore or stopped and gotten a beer and had them call/text you when they were ready.

He took a lot of smoke breaks and grumbled about stuff sometimes, but he was there. For my third sister's freshman move in, he had terminal cancer and was in a lot of pain, but he still showed up.

But I'm sure glad that my dad was present for me every day while he was here. It's not something you should even be asking your kid to ponder at 19, unless they have to.

When he married his 3rd wife, she tried to build a relationship between my father and me. I loved her dearly. I would tell people all the time that I loved her more than him! She was an amazing person. \n\nWe lost her in March to cancer. I realize now that she must have done everything for him. He died not even three months later in May. I haven't even really cried/grieved his death yet because I don't know how I feel about it. I balled when she died, though.", "You died first???", "As a Gen-X person, I have fallen somewhere in the middle. I feel like I am an extremely empathetic person until it crosses into absurdity. Then I\u2019m like \u201c come on! Suck it up, life isn\u2019t fair, move on\u201d. \n\nSomething horrible and tragic? I will be your shoulder until the end of time.\n\nComplaining for the sake of complaining annoys me to no end.", "Most of the older cohort of  Gen X have Silent Generation parents who are very different than Boomers.", "Same.  I did do therapy to break the cycles of my parents, but I roll my eyes at some complaints and think \"Life isn't fair. Deal with it.\"  I don't say it, but I think it while I give them the comfort they need.  \n\nThat said, my boomer dad is great.  When he and mom dropped me off at college in 1996, he was upset about it and had I asked him to help make my bed or pin posters to the wall, he would have done it without blinking an eye because he loves me and hated leaving me at college.  OP is YTA."]}
