Obviously college kids can unpack and decorate themselves and she would if anything happened to her parents. It was about your wife spending more time with her before she stays at college. I feel you ruined the experience.", "YTA. Why would you ruin your daughter\u2019s send off? Helping her decorate is standard kid college drop off stuff. A trip to Target for essentials, a mini-fridge, some groceries, etc. Your wife wanted to help. Who are you to judge? Do you have trouble when you\u2019re not the center of attention? It sure sounds like it. Try shelving your main character energy for a moment and learn to be supportive.", "YTA - they are right, you ruined a nice time. Her memory of starting college will forever be her dad insulting her", "YTA. This wasn't about her *needing* help. They were bonding. They were spending time together and enjoying each other's company. You sat on your butt in the other room instead of participating, then intentionally spoiled things for them. That sucks. If your wife didn't want to help, she would have ducked out earlier. She enjoyed being with her daughter and being a part of her new life.", "YTA obviously your daughter could decorate herself, your wife WANTED to help her because it\u2019s fun and they\u2019re spending time together, and her daughter is leaving the nest. Couldn\u2019t you have just sat there on your phone and been quiet like a normal dad", "YTA. Your wife was parenting because she loves her daughter. Maybe you should try it.", "This was part of the process of your daughter's transition to college. Had nothing to do with being needy. Kind of like a final thing for them to share. And you ruined it. YTA", "Oh, holy crow! You took a bonding moment, one of your daughter's firsts, and blew it out of the water because your fee fees were hurt from not being the center of attention. That was a great way to show, and tell, your daughter that she's only important when it's convenient for you.\n\nThis wasn't a time that your wife was decorating because your daughter couldn't, it was a time for them to share as a right of passage - daughter's first place (her dorm room), being semi on her own, growing into womanhood and making her own decisions while getting her education. And you turned it into...okay, so we're here, your stuff is here, it's been an hour, why are you still needing your mom to unpack, wife get in the car let's go. Yes, YTA of epic proportions.\n\nBTW you do realize SHE will most likely be the one picking your nursing home, right? Don't worry, your wife will be living with her and her family.", "YTA. \n\nIt is very clear that your wife *wanted* to help decorate. Of course your daughter *could* do it on her own. It's hard for most kids to go away from home for the first time as a new adult, and it's hard for *most* parents--but apparently not you--to leave them there. Your wife clearly feels that way, and wanted to spend that extra time with your daughter, setting up the space where she's going to live and talking with her. Your reactions, particularly asking her daughter what she would do if you or her mother died, were way out of line, and you spoiled what should have been a happy, if bittersweet, moment. \n\n Your daughter's behavior was fine. Yours, however, is concerning. You don't seem to empathize with your daughter or wife at all, or to miss your daughter now that she's moved away.", "YTA. What you don\u2019t seem to understand is being a parent is a job you hold for a lifetime. You and your wife have life experience that your kids could greatly benefit from and you should want them to learn from you rather than leaving them to figure it out for themselves. Your daughter knows nothing about setting up a new place, but your wife does which is why your wife stuck around to help her. It\u2019s not like your daughter left the apartment and your wife had to set things up by herself. They were doing it together. You\u2019re correct that the time will come when you won\u2019t be around to help out but that day isn\u2019t today so help guide your kids through life while you\u2019re still able to do it.", "YTA, when I was 25 and moving into a new apartment I didn't NEED my mom's help, but I still appreciated and loved that she came to help and take me shopping for things like food and cleaning supplies etc. It was a bonding moment.\nYour daughter wasn't being needy, your wife was helping her and supporting like a good parent. Going off to college can be scary and having a parent help move, unpack, decorate, etc can help ease some of the nerves and provides a good time to bond and be with each other for what may be several months (depending on how close you are to home). You ruined a perfectly normal and good time with your needy comment.", "YTA your wife wants to help your daughter to move in apartment. Her child is grown up and move out she might feel lose and don't know what to do next since there is no children at home for her to care anymore.", "YTA setting up your dorm room or your first apartment at college? When you don\u2019t have a SO or someone you know as a roommate, it\u2019s really normal to do that with your parents. Especially when they are about to drive off and you are living alone for the first time. Those extra minutes deciding where to put up a poster or arranging cooking supplies?  Really precious. \n\nAnd that\u2019s coming from someone who had a super contentious relationship with her parents as a teenager. It still was really hard that first night to heat up leftovers from the lunch my dad had brought over and then eat alone. My mom told me later that when she called to check if I was settled in/ready for classes she hung up and turned to see my dad who I\u2019ve never seen cry except when he lost immediate family sitting there crying silently. Because it\u2019s a big deal when you and your kids make this transition!  \n\nYou seem really uninterested in your kids and like you aren\u2019t going to miss her or don\u2019t care whether she struggles or not. Helping set up the apartment isnt coddling. It\u2019s supportive and bonding behavior.", "If you don\u2019t want to be there for your daughter just say that. YTA", "YTA do you even like your wife and daughter?", "Your wife and daughter shared a beautiful moment and a wonderful memory \n\nThe sad part of it all is you could have been a part of it\n\nBut instead, you chose to act like someone who knocks over a Lego town because only babies do stuff like that \n\nYTA", "INFO were you planning on just dipping out of your kids' lives?", "YTA - Your daughter just moved out. She is nervous as she is now going to be on her own to an extent in an unfamiliar place. Helping to unpack and decorate is a common thing for mothers to do, particularly with their daughters, and more important than that, she wanted to help her daughter. This was an emotional day and bonding experience for them, but you pooped all over it by telling your daughter to grow up. How about you grow up and allow people to have their emotions, instead of being robots like you?", "YTA. I would hope your wife would help your daughter move into college and decorate. It\u2019s very common for mothers to help their daughters in that way. I\u2019m in college and I don\u2019t know any girl who didn\u2019t have their mom help them like that! It can be a special bonding moment. I think it\u2019s lovely that they wanted to do that together. \n\nShe\u2019s 19. There\u2019s plenty of time for her to learn independence.", "YTA. Seems like you could hardly wait to drop off your daughter and leave her. I guess it was nice of you to help her move in. Too bad you had to cap it off with, you or her mom might die or something, so she better get used to life without you.", "YTA. Do you even like your family? Because unless you start acting like it, you\u2019ll always be the grumpy man on the sidelines.", "Wow YTA do you hate your daughter?", "YTA, your wife wanted to help. It\u2019s part of the process, setting your kid up in their dorm/apartment. Ever think about why you were the unwanted person here?", "YTA. It was a bonding moment that you could have been involved in, but instead you ruined the moment. \n\n\nThis is her first time living away from you guys and this is going to be an exciting but scary time. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is the beginning of the end of whatever relationship you guys have.", "Yta.. also I bet you were just waiting for this day\n To have no more kid in house? \nAll about this post is your crying about because wife wanted to help daughter move in properly.", "YTA - why are you so quick to get rid of your kid?", "YTA Why wouldn\u2019t you want to spend time with your kid and help them? Do you even like your daughter? You ruined that moment and time for everyone. Why should your daughter invite or include you ever again, when you\u2019ve shown her you don\u2019t want to be with her? Your presence in your daughter\u2019s life, ever again, will not be necessary. It\u2019s unlikely \n\nWhy should she have to be alone if she doesn\u2019t need to be? How is denying her your help and presence while you are alive going to prepare her for when you\u2019re gone? So she can practice being alone? At this point, if you died, she\u2019ll just shrug and say \u2018he didn\u2019t want to be around anyways so this isn\u2019t any different\u2019, and go back to her day.", "YTA I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my dad", "YTA. Yes, young adults need to develop their independence, but the very first day your kid moves out of home is hardly the time to get in her face about it. There\u2019s nothing unusually needy in what happened here - nothing unusual at all, except a father who\u2019s unusually impatient and decided to be unkind on what should have been a happy, exciting day for his daughter.", "Info:  All I see is your wife deciding to help her and not where the daughter is being 'needy'.", "YTA.  Imaging being so self centered that you don't see that your wife needs time with your daughter too and so gross that you say something that ugly to your own child right before their audition when you're getting ready to head back home.  Is this for real?\n\nYeah, maybe next time don't come.  I have 3 in college.  I hope this is fake because any parent with a quarter of a brain and even a smidge of empathy would have been able to avoid showing their whole ass like you did.  Wow", "YTA, big time. When I moved out, I felt bad about my mother being there and helping so much, I told her it wasn't necessary and I could do it myself, but she kept finding more and more excuses to keep at it. Your wife wasn't doing if for your daughter, your wife was doing it for herself, she wasn't ready for your daughter to leave the nest.", "YTA   What a horrible and heartless dad you are. Do you even love your daughter? Where the hell is your empathy and compassion?", "YTA. One of my happiest memories is of my mom, dad and my maternal grandparents, who were all so excited for me to enter this new phase of my life, wanting to help set up my dorm room & later my apartment when I went to grad school. They didn\u2019t do this because I was a helpless damsel, but because it gave them joy to spend this extra time with me, to know they had a hand in making sure I was set up for success, safe and secure. Think of it like this\u2026it\u2019s like when you would make sure your daughter was securely tucked in bed as a wee slip of a girl. It made your heart warm & full of love.  You could have been a welcome part of this moment and memory being made. Instead you were Modern Family\u2019s Jay in the episode where he was initially happy no one wanted him to do anything. Later he felt the loss of being included and decided to join in painting Joe\u2019s room. Unlike you who stayed divorced from positive emotions & family bonding.\n\nYour daughter won\u2019t be needy or helpless without the guidance of her parents. You were heartless and hurt your wife and daughter deeply with your words and actions.\n\nAre you a tin man in need of a heart? I hear they have one in Emerald City. Just follow the yellow brick road. Then take a good hard look in the mirror before you go apologize to your wife and daughter.", "Yeah YTA. \nGosh it reminds me of your generation so much- mum helping and being present and dad getting shitty she\u2019s doing to much and preventing her. \nOne day you will be dead you don\u2019t have to prepare her for it. Just be present in every way you can it was a special moment in her life, your wife was being present for and you wrecked it.", "Boooo OP, boooo. YTA. Goddamn", "Absolutely Yta. Let mom help if she wants to. My husband once told his mother that if she leaves us first, he would probably not bother with his father. Think about it.", "YTA- even grown adults who are friends or family help each other move and unpack in a new home. I have done that. It\u2019s not about \u201cneeding.\u201d You seem to be hung up on that. They were enjoying themselves doing this together and spending time setting up your daughters first apartment. You ruined it for no good reason and told her she should have acted like you and your wife were dead already, yeesh!", "YTA, the issue is your lack of patience.", "YTA. This was a bonding experience at a significant time in her life that also comes with a lot of change. Your daughter was making a special memory with her mother and you ruined it.", "YTA. It seems to me your wife and daughter just wanted to spend time together. What is so terrible about that?", "YTA. Do you even love your daughter? Are small gestures like these considered too much?", "YTA. What was even the point of even saying that? Why be bothered that your wife wanted to spend as much time with your daughter as possible before the opportunities to do so become less and less frequent. Don\u2019t you care about that at all?", "\"What would she do if something happened to either of her parents?\" \n\nHmm, if something happened to you, she'd probably heave a sigh of relief for not having to deal with your emotionally constipated, socially inept self anymore.  Her mother, the person who took time to help her do small things when she didn't need to , and who showed her she loved her, she'd likely be very sad. \n\nYTA. What exactly is wrong with you?", "So you dropped your kid off to college, sit and mopped while they got set up and then asked her supposed you both died what would she do? \n\nWhy did you even go???\n\nWhy didn't you stay home and let your wife go and get her set up if it was such a waste of your precious time? You sound like you wanted to twist the knife to make sure she knows not to come back home. Were you trying to make her understand that you're done with her and you no longer want to be her parent that she can call on for assistance?", "She is not needy ffs, her mother couldn't just \"let her go\" that day. You have a heart of stone, it seems.", "YTA. I would kill to have a mom like your wife because I sure as heck never got any of that. This was a special bonding moment for your wife and daughter because she\u2019s out of the house and your wife wanted to spend a little more time with her. If not being the center of attention affects you that much you should\u2019ve just stayed home and threw your little temper tantrum there. Also, I guess she can live with out you with how much of a prick you are.", "YTA. Let them bond. Or even better, get in on the love.", "YTA. It has nothing to do with being needy, and everything to do with the bond between your wife and your daughter. Did you even bother to find out if your daughter asked her mother to help, or whether it was something your wife AS HER MOTHER volunteered to do? Your wife might not have been quite ready to let her child go yet and wanted to do a few last things that would allow her to spend a little more time with her daughter. I'm sure your daughter was capable of unpacking and decorating herself - but unlike you, she saw that her mother WANTED to do it.

Oh and she died 7 years ago today. I know I have a hell of a lot better memories with my mum then you daughter will have with you and that breaks my heart for your daughter. At least she will have found memories of mum to look back on, especially if you die first, but I wouldn\u2019t hold out hope for a moving speech at your funeral.\nAnd by the way, moving myself out of home in no way shape or form prepared me for losing my mum at 23, nor did the \u2018tough\u2019 love I received from an abusive grandparent in my childhood.

What was so important that you needed to get home for? My dad used to act like this when he wanted to get home to drink. We have a very strained relationship. Get therapy, or at least rethink your priorities. \n\nCollege is already fucking scary for your daughter because she's taking her first big steps towards independence, and you're throwing her in the deep end asking how she'd cope if you fucking /died/ instead of helping to ease the transition so that she can feel confident in stepping out on her own.

You\u2019re treating it like a chore and a burden, but she\u2019s your child why don\u2019t you WANT to help?

YTA for making a real bonding moment all about what you want", "You are such an asshole. It's not about the unpacking or decorating you turd. It's about spending time together.\n\nLeaving home is hard. Learning to live away from your parents is even more difficult. Don't you understand your kids love you??? Do you not want that??? Wtf", "Yta. You clearly never parented or cared for your  children. Your poor wife must be considering leaving you.", "YTA and I hope your wife has a good support system", "Yes, you're the asshole", "It does seem like YTA from this info alone. It sounds to me like your wife and daughter bond through these kinds of things. Some of my best memories with my mom were doing things like this. From what you said it also seems like your wife initiates helping your daughter so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fair for you to come at your daughter like that.", "NTA. Your kid sounds like every other kid who can\u2019t do anything for themselves. You\u2019ll be supporting her for at least another decade. You are welcome.", "YTA. Did it ever occur to you that your wife was going to miss your daughter and that by helping her it was a way of allaying her fears more than your daughter being needy. Your wife can\u2019t talk to you it would seem cause you have no understanding about seeing your daughter leave home probably never to come home to live again might cause her sadness.", "YTA - It\u2019s not about your daughter being \u201cneedy\u201d it\u2019s about your wife wanting to spend more time with her before she is away at college, you ruined this for both your wife and your daughter", "YTA. She CAN decorate the room by herself but did it ever occur that your mom and daughter might ENJOY to do it together? Maby even with your help? Not because its so difficult or complicated but because they find it a nice thing to do together For the very reason that you brought up: sooner or later you and or your wife will die and this - moving out - actually is a milestone that both your mom and daughter wanted to enjoy together, with a memory to cherish that might last forever.\n\nRandom simple things like decorating a room together can create deeper and better memories than the fanciest holidays to Disney land or whatever. You indeed ruined everything here, but it's not too late to turn things around.", "YTA that clearly hates your child and despises that your wife is a loving mother who enjoys spending time with her daughter. What are you going to do when you are elderly and your daughter wants nothing to do with you?", "YTA, sounds to me like you were happy to finally get the kid out of your house, I\u2019m surprised you even went on the trip.", "YTA. This was probably a mother daughter bonding experience for them, especially if this is her freshman year and first time moving away from home. WHY choose that moment as the example of why she needs to stop being so needy? So lets break this down... you say she is being needy because her mom helps her decorate. Are you suggesting that if her mom didn't help the decorations would have all stayed in the boxes and she never would have decorated her room? That she actually NEEDED the help decorating? Because the way you are trying to justify your YTA behavior right now is by saying you want to teach her a lesson about not being so needy so she can take care of herself. So what about this moment of them decorating together rang those bells in your head that you need to teach her that lesson? Yeah exactly... she didn't need her mom to decorate... they just wanted to do it together... you are just reaching for a way to justify your behavior. So what is the real reason you said that?", "YTA - she wasn\u2019t being needy they were creating core memories that you\u2019ve now ruined with your bs. This is why your child/ren will not want to have anything to do with you by choice. Bc app spending time with you makes them less than.", "YTA, it's not on your daughter that your wife likes to help out.. why wouldn't you want to help if you can? \nSounds like your daughter did absolutely nothing wrong and you're just an AH for the sake of it", "WOW YTA\n\nYou took a special moment between your daughter and her mom, and had to shit on it, and you don't understand that you suck for it? You sound like you don't care about your kid. Just because she's an adult doesn't mean she can't want to have quality time with her mom! I'm 32 and I still hang out with my mom. So does my boyfriend, and both of our older siblings. \n\nJust because you don't want your kid around doesn't mean she can't still want to spend time with her mom. It's clear why she wouldn't want to spend time with you, though. It's a good thing you don't want her to talk to you ever again, I doubt she will.", "Dude, just have a bit more compassion and patience, that's all bro.\nAfter all, it wasnt about you. It was about your daughter and wife. Your wife sounds like she is going to miss your daughter a lot while staying at college and probably vice versa. In comparison to you,  you should recognise this. College may have been different for yourself, just like me at university, it was a feeling of 'can't wait to be free'. Where as I think its the opposite for your daughter from what you have written.\n\nI agree with you that everyone has to learn to do things on their own. Maybe decorating the room would have given your daughter something to do while she settles in the dorm etc...but it was a last bonding session or moment for the rest of your family. Sometimes, just keeping your mouth shut and then discussing things like this with your wife at home (not arguing) is the best form of action. Worded something like...\"Do you think our daughter will be OK on her own? - I cant help but notice she seems aprenhensive to leave us, which is totally understandable. Will you be OK too?\" \n\nThat would have sufficed and given you a greater understanding of their relationship and feelings.\n\nYour not an Asshole....just still learning my man. Just be there and apologise to your daughter and wife. Maybe go visit your daughter on yiur own, take her for some food and things for her dorm to help her understand you do care and most importantly. Tell her you care and love her and that your there for her if she needs anything and re-assure her that she will be OK. It's OK to miss people you love and doesn't mean you're not grown up or strong. It means you love them", "Wtf did I just read?  Once a wk or so I run across nonsense like this.   Tell me and everyone wtf ur daughter and wife did wrong?  U need a shrink.  Without a sincere apology idk how u come back from this abuse.  Yta clearly", "Yta - and detached from ur children and ur wife. It\u2019s always me me me just because ur children and young adults they will never stop needing the parents \u2014- well not u cuz they could do without all ur negative enerhy", "You're the asshole and a huge one at that. God forbid we spend a little time with our kids before we leave them at college. I hope she sees this and takes some small measure of satisfaction, knowing that we all collectively think you're an absolute prick.", "\"I don't understand the value of an interaction two people are having without me, and it is very very mildly inconveniencing me, ergo, it must be the result of a personality flaw on both their parts. I will immediately tell them my conclusion. They will definitely value my insight.\"\n\nYTA.", "YTA", "Don't interfere with girl rituals.", "YTA Do you even like your daughter? You obviously don't love her. \n\nYou hurried to get rid of her and the responsibility,  not even cared for a good start. \n\nI'm glad she got at least a decent mother.", "YTA.", "YTA. Obviously. \nBut what is of more importance is why are you TA? Why do you appear to feel no emotion over your daughter leaving for college? Why are you pushing her away?\nI'm going to presume that you love your daughter, but that love is not even remotely apparent in what you wrote. \nSo I am wondering what kind of relationship you have with your parents. Why are you so absent in your daughter's life even though you are right there? What's going on with you? There is nothing wrong or unusual with your daughter and your wife's behavior, but your behavior is troubling.", "Oh, so you\u2019re one of those \u201cdads\u201d who did your job for 18 years and now you don\u2019t want to be a parent anymore. YTA", "Fml, YTA. I had lost both my parents by the time I finished university, and threatening your daughter with that reality is unbelievably cruel. At her age, wanting to be close to your parents isn\u2019t needy, it\u2019s normal. She\u2019s going through a big life change and obviously wants your support. You sound like a shit dad.", "YTA your timing was awful", "YTA and basically for no reason", "Massive YTA. Moving out is a big change in life, and if your wife spending that extra time with your daughter can make the transition easier you should support that. Its not about not being needy. You should have been there with them, not pouting like a kid.", "I just can\u2019t. YTA.", "Omgosh YES!!!! YTA!!! your baby is officially going off to college and this is hard for a mom!!! Especially one who\u2019s spent her past SEVERAL years catering to! Your wife needed and wanted this day just as much as your daughter. It\u2019s one for the books and I\u2019d have to agree with your wife, should have stayed home. And I\u2019d have to agree with your daughter, you ruined everything!  Your impatience was not needed on this day. What was so important, that you wanted to get out of there so badly?", "YTA - your daughter and wife were having a moment.  Your wife was just as reluctant to part her daughter as your daughter wanted to keep her mother around as long as possible before being alone for the school year.\n\nDo you even like your daughter?  Do you not care about her or your wife's feelings?", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about needing help decorating it was about bonding before saying farewell.\n\nDumbass.", "YTA- You are extremely dense if you think this is just a case of packing, unpacking and decorating . Its about spending a few more moments with each other before everything changes. College is an extremely transformative chapter since it\u2019s the first step into adulthood. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for some to express what they are saying especially at that age, I know because I was the same. Sometimes you ask for little assistance from your loved ones just so you can be with them for some more time. Your wife wants to help because she wants to do everything she can to make her daughter feel at ease.\n\nIt\u2019s wild to me that you thought it appropriate to mention something happening to you and your wife to your daughter and such an already emotional and milestone moment in her life. Get a grip.", "YTA\n\nMy parents dropped me off at University Halls when I was 19, helped carry my stuff to my room, gave me a hug and left. I had been happy enough up to that point but felt absolutely awful - I thought maybe they\u2019d help me get my room ready and we could go out for lunch. \n\nWhy sit in the other room? Take an interest in your daughter\u2019s life FGS. Never mind YOU not being around forever for her, how about building a supportive relationship with her so SHE will want to spend time with you in the future.\n\nYour wife is right. Get involved or stay at home.", "And not only that, he came at her BEFORE HER AUDITION. OP is definitely the asshole here.", "YTA. You completely missed what this was about. It was a bonding moment between mom and daughter. You could have been a part of it but chose to make it about standing on her own feet. You also randomly did this and talked about her parents dying, just before she had to go to an audition?! Nice one dad.", "He totally ruined the experience who says something like that when dropping their kid off at college? YTA his daughter was needy because her mom and her were spending time decorating and then because OP dropped her off at an audition? There\u2019s something seriously wrong with OP", "Not even just her send-off, he said this to her as she was walking into an audition!", "One of my best memories is Dad coming with me when I moved into the dorms and the subsequent Kmart run to buy supplies like bowls and tea towels. \n\nOP is the asshole and ruined the moment for her.", "I moved into my 5th place on my own earlier this year, I\u2019m 29 and haven\u2019t lived with my parents for nearly 12 years. Do you think my parents bothered driving over 3 hours to help me move, even though I\u2019m a fully independent adult? Hell yes they did! They stayed for an entire weekend, helped me move boxes of shit up stairs and then helped me unpack and made me breakfast the next day. Did I NEED their help? No, but like you I really love my parents and love spending time with them. Mum stayed with me last weekend just for fun and I still get a little sad when they leave/I leave after I visit them.", "Probably didn\u2019t want to be a dad to begin with, and reminds his poor daughter frequently of what a burden she is.", "In 25 years or so, please don\u2019t expect your daughter to care for you if something happens. Don\u2019t be so needy. Go ahead and make plans for a nursing home of your choosing. YTA, massively.", "He was not caught unwittingly, and there was no crossfire. She was only mad because of the comments made by her husband, it's only crossfire when someone else causes the anger. In this case the husband was the only one who made his wife angry.", "Ah, one of the poor saps that can't accept personal responsibility. Just live your whole life picking your nose and then pointing at other people like they made you do it when they are grossed out by your choices. You can jerk yourself to your hearts content, but everyone looks at you with that attitude and says \"ew, gross\"", "He's definitely an asshole, the daughter wasn't even being needy.", "Nothing in the post indicates that the daughter is spoiled", "All she did with help her daughter decorate and hug her  goodbye", "It appears the husband is the problem, why do you believe the wife is the problem?", "It appears the wife offered to decorate and the daughter agreed. Decorating is perfectly reasonable.", "But man I\u2019d feel terrible for wasting all that time to just ruine it for them at the end of the day. She can never get that memory back you ruined a once in a lifetime experience for her she will never forget you ruined something so important to her. Get therapy if you can\u2019t see your faults", "Honestly one of the biggest assholes I've seen here\nIn a LONG time.", "College administrator as well. Coming off move in day and I feel so sad for this young lady. Hopefully she has a great college experience and her dad stops being a dick.", "Or come in 2 different cars. He could have gone home and mom could have hung out as long as her daughter wanted her there.", "Ding ding ding. My father didn\u2019t help at all (didn\u2019t even come), my mom helped until my Sr year, and then made a huge deal about how she wasn\u2019t going to help me move in my last year because \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d \n\nThat still stings almost 20 years later.", "He didn\u2019t even have to help, could\u2019ve just been there with them, but he chose not to spend time with his daughter before leaving. He really just wanted to just drop her things off and go. I could see how the kids might have a stronger relationship with mom if he sees time together as wasting his time and that they need to figure everything out on their own.", ">Spoiler alert: we don't speak anymore.\n\nOh, that's perfect for OP, then, since he hates his daughter.", "This is the same ideology that will have him wondering where his daughter is when she has his grandkid he will never see. All because she is \" too needy.\" Or it's annoying. Seem like some doesn't like their wife having quality time with other people.", "Seriously, how hard is it to sit in the living room and dick around on your phone.", "Probably counted down the days till he could shove daughters butt out the door.", "Exactly this - and exactly what my own dad would have done as well, because it wasn't all about him at the moment. OP may just end up like my dad did - not a part of the family bc nobody wants anything to do with his general assholery. (And I'm also extremely grateful that I married a man who is the absolute opposite).", "Or it could be both. Jealous his daughter gets the love he didn\u2019t get.", "Yep! Way to go OP for damaging your relationship with your daughter over nothing", "Or not even gone at all! Sounds like he didn\u2019t want to be there in the first place. I imagine they would have had a better time without him, but something leads me to believe he doesn\u2019t let his wife out of his sight, like ever.", "Idk I doubt he'll give a shit about his grandkids.", "Yup. It's especially bad if the wife dies first. Then the men rattle around silent, empty houses until they die on the toilet. They never build relationships with their kids/grandkids and just vanish from life."]}
