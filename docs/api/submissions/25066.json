My wife told me that she was going to help, and that since we didn't have any other plans, time shouldn't matter.\n\nMy wife does a lot for our kids, and I think that because they are young adults, they can do things for themselves.

Obviously college kids can unpack and decorate themselves and she would if anything happened to her parents. It was about your wife spending more time with her before she stays at college. I feel you ruined the experience.", "YTA. Why would you ruin your daughter\u2019s send off? Helping her decorate is standard kid college drop off stuff. A trip to Target for essentials, a mini-fridge, some groceries, etc. Your wife wanted to help. Who are you to judge? Do you have trouble when you\u2019re not the center of attention? It sure sounds like it. Try shelving your main character energy for a moment and learn to be supportive.", "YTA - they are right, you ruined a nice time. Her memory of starting college will forever be her dad insulting her", "YTA. This wasn't about her *needing* help. They were bonding. They were spending time together and enjoying each other's company. You sat on your butt in the other room instead of participating, then intentionally spoiled things for them. That sucks. If your wife didn't want to help, she would have ducked out earlier. She enjoyed being with her daughter and being a part of her new life.", "YTA obviously your daughter could decorate herself, your wife WANTED to help her because it\u2019s fun and they\u2019re spending time together, and her daughter is leaving the nest. Couldn\u2019t you have just sat there on your phone and been quiet like a normal dad", "YTA. Your wife was parenting because she loves her daughter. Maybe you should try it.", "This was part of the process of your daughter's transition to college. Had nothing to do with being needy. Kind of like a final thing for them to share. And you ruined it. YTA", "Oh, holy crow! You took a bonding moment, one of your daughter's firsts, and blew it out of the water because your fee fees were hurt from not being the center of attention. That was a great way to show, and tell, your daughter that she's only important when it's convenient for you.\n\nThis wasn't a time that your wife was decorating because your daughter couldn't, it was a time for them to share as a right of passage - daughter's first place (her dorm room), being semi on her own, growing into womanhood and making her own decisions while getting her education. And you turned it into...okay, so we're here, your stuff is here, it's been an hour, why are you still needing your mom to unpack, wife get in the car let's go. Yes, YTA of epic proportions.\n\nBTW you do realize SHE will most likely be the one picking your nursing home, right? Don't worry, your wife will be living with her and her family.", "YTA. \n\nIt is very clear that your wife *wanted* to help decorate. Of course your daughter *could* do it on her own. It's hard for most kids to go away from home for the first time as a new adult, and it's hard for *most* parents--but apparently not you--to leave them there. Your wife clearly feels that way, and wanted to spend that extra time with your daughter, setting up the space where she's going to live and talking with her. Your reactions, particularly asking her daughter what she would do if you or her mother died, were way out of line, and you spoiled what should have been a happy, if bittersweet, moment. \n\n Your daughter's behavior was fine. Yours, however, is concerning. You don't seem to empathize with your daughter or wife at all, or to miss your daughter now that she's moved away.", "YTA. What you don\u2019t seem to understand is being a parent is a job you hold for a lifetime. You and your wife have life experience that your kids could greatly benefit from and you should want them to learn from you rather than leaving them to figure it out for themselves. Your daughter knows nothing about setting up a new place, but your wife does which is why your wife stuck around to help her. It\u2019s not like your daughter left the apartment and your wife had to set things up by herself. They were doing it together. You\u2019re correct that the time will come when you won\u2019t be around to help out but that day isn\u2019t today so help guide your kids through life while you\u2019re still able to do it.", "YTA, when I was 25 and moving into a new apartment I didn't NEED my mom's help, but I still appreciated and loved that she came to help and take me shopping for things like food and cleaning supplies etc. It was a bonding moment.\nYour daughter wasn't being needy, your wife was helping her and supporting like a good parent. Going off to college can be scary and having a parent help move, unpack, decorate, etc can help ease some of the nerves and provides a good time to bond and be with each other for what may be several months (depending on how close you are to home). You ruined a perfectly normal and good time with your needy comment.", "YTA your wife wants to help your daughter to move in apartment. Her child is grown up and move out she might feel lose and don't know what to do next since there is no children at home for her to care anymore.", "YTA setting up your dorm room or your first apartment at college? When you don\u2019t have a SO or someone you know as a roommate, it\u2019s really normal to do that with your parents. Especially when they are about to drive off and you are living alone for the first time. Those extra minutes deciding where to put up a poster or arranging cooking supplies?  Really precious. \n\nAnd that\u2019s coming from someone who had a super contentious relationship with her parents as a teenager. It still was really hard that first night to heat up leftovers from the lunch my dad had brought over and then eat alone. My mom told me later that when she called to check if I was settled in/ready for classes she hung up and turned to see my dad who I\u2019ve never seen cry except when he lost immediate family sitting there crying silently. Because it\u2019s a big deal when you and your kids make this transition!  \n\nYou seem really uninterested in your kids and like you aren\u2019t going to miss her or don\u2019t care whether she struggles or not. Helping set up the apartment isnt coddling. It\u2019s supportive and bonding behavior.", "If you don\u2019t want to be there for your daughter just say that. YTA", "YTA do you even like your wife and daughter?", "Your wife and daughter shared a beautiful moment and a wonderful memory \n\nThe sad part of it all is you could have been a part of it\n\nBut instead, you chose to act like someone who knocks over a Lego town because only babies do stuff like that \n\nYTA", "INFO were you planning on just dipping out of your kids' lives?", "YTA - Your daughter just moved out. She is nervous as she is now going to be on her own to an extent in an unfamiliar place. Helping to unpack and decorate is a common thing for mothers to do, particularly with their daughters, and more important than that, she wanted to help her daughter. This was an emotional day and bonding experience for them, but you pooped all over it by telling your daughter to grow up. How about you grow up and allow people to have their emotions, instead of being robots like you?", "YTA. I would hope your wife would help your daughter move into college and decorate. It\u2019s very common for mothers to help their daughters in that way. I\u2019m in college and I don\u2019t know any girl who didn\u2019t have their mom help them like that! It can be a special bonding moment. I think it\u2019s lovely that they wanted to do that together. \n\nShe\u2019s 19. There\u2019s plenty of time for her to learn independence.", "YTA. Seems like you could hardly wait to drop off your daughter and leave her. I guess it was nice of you to help her move in. Too bad you had to cap it off with, you or her mom might die or something, so she better get used to life without you.", "YTA. Do you even like your family? Because unless you start acting like it, you\u2019ll always be the grumpy man on the sidelines.", "Wow YTA do you hate your daughter?", "YTA, your wife wanted to help. It\u2019s part of the process, setting your kid up in their dorm/apartment. Ever think about why you were the unwanted person here?", "YTA. It was a bonding moment that you could have been involved in, but instead you ruined the moment. \n\n\nThis is her first time living away from you guys and this is going to be an exciting but scary time. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is the beginning of the end of whatever relationship you guys have.", "Yta.. also I bet you were just waiting for this day\n To have no more kid in house? \nAll about this post is your crying about because wife wanted to help daughter move in properly.", "YTA - why are you so quick to get rid of your kid?", "YTA Why wouldn\u2019t you want to spend time with your kid and help them? Do you even like your daughter? You ruined that moment and time for everyone. Why should your daughter invite or include you ever again, when you\u2019ve shown her you don\u2019t want to be with her? Your presence in your daughter\u2019s life, ever again, will not be necessary. It\u2019s unlikely \n\nWhy should she have to be alone if she doesn\u2019t need to be? How is denying her your help and presence while you are alive going to prepare her for when you\u2019re gone? So she can practice being alone? At this point, if you died, she\u2019ll just shrug and say \u2018he didn\u2019t want to be around anyways so this isn\u2019t any different\u2019, and go back to her day.", "YTA I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my dad", "YTA. Yes, young adults need to develop their independence, but the very first day your kid moves out of home is hardly the time to get in her face about it. There\u2019s nothing unusually needy in what happened here - nothing unusual at all, except a father who\u2019s unusually impatient and decided to be unkind on what should have been a happy, exciting day for his daughter.", "Info:  All I see is your wife deciding to help her and not where the daughter is being 'needy'.", "YTA.  Imaging being so self centered that you don't see that your wife needs time with your daughter too and so gross that you say something that ugly to your own child right before their audition when you're getting ready to head back home.  Is this for real?\n\nYeah, maybe next time don't come.  I have 3 in college.  I hope this is fake because any parent with a quarter of a brain and even a smidge of empathy would have been able to avoid showing their whole ass like you did.  Wow", "YTA, big time. When I moved out, I felt bad about my mother being there and helping so much, I told her it wasn't necessary and I could do it myself, but she kept finding more and more excuses to keep at it. Your wife wasn't doing if for your daughter, your wife was doing it for herself, she wasn't ready for your daughter to leave the nest.", "YTA   What a horrible and heartless dad you are. Do you even love your daughter? Where the hell is your empathy and compassion?", "YTA. One of my happiest memories is of my mom, dad and my maternal grandparents, who were all so excited for me to enter this new phase of my life, wanting to help set up my dorm room & later my apartment when I went to grad school. They didn\u2019t do this because I was a helpless damsel, but because it gave them joy to spend this extra time with me, to know they had a hand in making sure I was set up for success, safe and secure. Think of it like this\u2026it\u2019s like when you would make sure your daughter was securely tucked in bed as a wee slip of a girl. It made your heart warm & full of love.  You could have been a welcome part of this moment and memory being made. Instead you were Modern Family\u2019s Jay in the episode where he was initially happy no one wanted him to do anything. Later he felt the loss of being included and decided to join in painting Joe\u2019s room. Unlike you who stayed divorced from positive emotions & family bonding.\n\nYour daughter won\u2019t be needy or helpless without the guidance of her parents. You were heartless and hurt your wife and daughter deeply with your words and actions.\n\nAre you a tin man in need of a heart? I hear they have one in Emerald City. Just follow the yellow brick road. Then take a good hard look in the mirror before you go apologize to your wife and daughter.", "Yeah YTA. \nGosh it reminds me of your generation so much- mum helping and being present and dad getting shitty she\u2019s doing to much and preventing her. \nOne day you will be dead you don\u2019t have to prepare her for it. Just be present in every way you can it was a special moment in her life, your wife was being present for and you wrecked it.", "Boooo OP, boooo. YTA. Goddamn", "Absolutely Yta. Let mom help if she wants to. My husband once told his mother that if she leaves us first, he would probably not bother with his father. Think about it.", "YTA- even grown adults who are friends or family help each other move and unpack in a new home. I have done that. It\u2019s not about \u201cneeding.\u201d You seem to be hung up on that. They were enjoying themselves doing this together and spending time setting up your daughters first apartment. You ruined it for no good reason and told her she should have acted like you and your wife were dead already, yeesh!", "YTA, the issue is your lack of patience.", "YTA. This was a bonding experience at a significant time in her life that also comes with a lot of change. Your daughter was making a special memory with her mother and you ruined it.", "YTA. It seems to me your wife and daughter just wanted to spend time together. What is so terrible about that?", "YTA. Do you even love your daughter? Are small gestures like these considered too much?", "YTA. What was even the point of even saying that? Why be bothered that your wife wanted to spend as much time with your daughter as possible before the opportunities to do so become less and less frequent. Don\u2019t you care about that at all?", "\"What would she do if something happened to either of her parents?\" \n\nHmm, if something happened to you, she'd probably heave a sigh of relief for not having to deal with your emotionally constipated, socially inept self anymore.  Her mother, the person who took time to help her do small things when she didn't need to , and who showed her she loved her, she'd likely be very sad. \n\nYTA. What exactly is wrong with you?", "So you dropped your kid off to college, sit and mopped while they got set up and then asked her supposed you both died what would she do? \n\nWhy did you even go???\n\nWhy didn't you stay home and let your wife go and get her set up if it was such a waste of your precious time? You sound like you wanted to twist the knife to make sure she knows not to come back home. Were you trying to make her understand that you're done with her and you no longer want to be her parent that she can call on for assistance?", "She is not needy ffs, her mother couldn't just \"let her go\" that day. You have a heart of stone, it seems.", "YTA. I would kill to have a mom like your wife because I sure as heck never got any of that. This was a special bonding moment for your wife and daughter because she\u2019s out of the house and your wife wanted to spend a little more time with her. If not being the center of attention affects you that much you should\u2019ve just stayed home and threw your little temper tantrum there. Also, I guess she can live with out you with how much of a prick you are.", "YTA. Let them bond. Or even better, get in on the love.", "YTA. It has nothing to do with being needy, and everything to do with the bond between your wife and your daughter. Did you even bother to find out if your daughter asked her mother to help, or whether it was something your wife AS HER MOTHER volunteered to do? Your wife might not have been quite ready to let her child go yet and wanted to do a few last things that would allow her to spend a little more time with her daughter. I'm sure your daughter was capable of unpacking and decorating herself - but unlike you, she saw that her mother WANTED to do it. You acted like a jerk, your comments to your daughter were completely out of line - and you owe both your daughter and your wife an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
