You didn't even know if it was true and ran to tell your brother and THEN you found out it was true. Either way, she did it years prior to even getting into a relationship with your brother and you made it your business to potentially ruin their marriage.

It's a deal breaker for many people and the husband has a right to know. Just saying ' it's in her past' as if that is an automatic gotcha is not the slam dunk people on this sub make it out to be. People in this sub bring up history of cheating as a deal breaker. Would you say the same thing as it happened in the past. While sex work and cheating are different issues, the premise remains the same.

If I had a brother/sister I would very much expect them to tell if my future husband slept with the entire town and then decided to hide it from me. Well done. Do not listen to these idiots in the comment section. A life partner has every right to know about their SO's past. A relationship is not built upon secrets. If you want people to respect sex work then do not hide it. If you're hiding it you're proving that you're embarrassed(rightfully so).

Is it really that big of a deal that that's what she did for work in the past? It sounds like she felt she had to keep it a secret because you and your family are judgemental.

But I guess that's seen as less bad because no one paid us?", "I did think about adding this disclaimer. I know women who've worked in sex work because they've been in a bad place but I also know women who've worked in sex work because it's lucrative. One woman I know just did it to pay off her degree and quit once she was qualified lol. She has zero shame about it and I respect that. The stigma around it is super gross.", "The reason she tried to keep it private could very well be stigma from a society that's still brainwashed by a particular religion.

It's just not a cool thing to do if they're happy and stable.", "What does it change if you found out your husband solicited sex workers every weekend for five years?", "So what?  Its in her past and it's not relevant to their relationship in any sense.  Does he know she had sex partners before?  Probably, so what does it matter who they were or what the situation was in which the sex took place?  Like i said unless there is an incurable disease at play here it has nothing to do with the present.  It certainly wasn't the brothers place to tell her husband", "Of course people are entitled to make that choice. \n\nReally you\u2019re entitled to make any choice you want. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t call those people out for making their choices uneducated. \n\nPeople will be offended by that because they don\u2019t like to be told things they already know. But if you analyze why those choices are being made most of the time it comes down to judgment and stigma. \n\nThe reality is that someone not being a sex worker doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019re \u201cpure\u201d. Nor does it guarantee they\u2019re STD free. Nor that they\u2019re faithful.", "\nMaybe it is or isn\u2019t relevant to their relationship, not our place to decide. Obviously it seemed relevant enough to the brother, as they had a fight about it.\n\nShe obviously knows him better than we do, but if getting someone to date you involves having to hide your past. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be dating them", "That's an extremely disingenuous argument. This \"hot take\" of yours is revealing someone was a sex worker without ever talking to said person to find out WHY she never told anyone. She more than likely has trauma related to it that she wants to forget. But I guess that doesn't matter.", "Again, I\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t have reasons for hiding it.\n\nI\u2019m saying if **she knew** the brother wouldn\u2019t date her because of her past, and still choice to hide it, that\u2019s an AH move. Plain and simple.\n\nSIL had multiple chances to bring it up, and never did. Maybe I\u2019m a pessimist, but I don\u2019t think she ever would have brought it up, even if confronted.\n\nObviously we don\u2019t know every conversation the two of them had, so I could be wrong, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reason as to why he said she betrayed his trust.", "There are plenty of low quality men that have zero qualms about a woman's past sex work. \n\nYou can date them.", "Again it's no one's place to tell someone your personal business.\n\nWe have no idea what she would or would not do and to argue such is pointless.\n\nThe fact is OP shared something extremely personal without even once talking to SIL about it. OP could have easily sat down with SIL and had a conversation about what she heard from the friend. But instead she ran to her brother and spilled the beans without knowing the context or history behind it.\n\nYes lying in a relationship is bad, but doing something like this without even attempting to reach out first is just not ok at all"]}
