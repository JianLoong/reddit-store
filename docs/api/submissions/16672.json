In fact, it's a question I ask, so, that if they lie to me, they have full moral responsibility of having lied to me to a very clear deal breaker. \n\nAbout former sex work or promiscuity, I just ask for health tests (if it becomes serious) or (if it's casual/at the beginning) condoms/dental dams. I'm just interested in the health aspect of it, not interested in the why and how, unless they want to talk about it.", "Yeah this was where my mind went too. Whilst I acknowledge some people go into sex work willingly - unfortunately a large majority are still victims of sexual violence.", "I agree. But OP absolutely should not have been the one to tell brother.", ">Replace sex work with large student debt, of which there is no sexual association, and the answer would still be you cannot keep it from your partner.\n\nBut these are two completely separate things. Being a former sex worker doesn't make it into some sort of lifetime \"debt\" you have to tell people about in any way or form.\n\nIf the husband has said anything related to that \"he could never be with a sex worker\", and then the sister-in law omitted, I would understand the issue. But this doesn't seem to be the case though.\n\nIt was her past and he had no right to share it.", "Loans are things that are detrimental to your life at the current time. A **former** sex worker is not presently having their life impacted in any way. So it's really not an equal thing.\n\nIt's like... Ughhh.. if you were a stripper or had an only fans in the past would you have to disclose? If you were abused to you have to disclose this information? If you dropped out of high school? If you cheated on your high school partner do you have to disclose this? If you lost a baby to a former partner do you have to disclose it? If you've had an abortion do you have to disclose it?\n\nIt's just.. yeah.. I don't get it. Do you have to present your entire past out for judgement as a test of your worthiness? That just doesn't sit right with me.", "It's not just the females responsibility. I got tested after every sexual partner I've had. Undoubtedly after quitting sex work she would have almost certainly gotten herself checked.", "Yeah it's ridiculous. The attitude towards sex work on here is really sad. I keep getting notifications with such hateful comments about this poor woman. People are so judgemental.", "Sounds like the pokemon rap would be a better way to go about it than a slideshow in your case.", ">Standard std tests don\u2019t account for things like HPV which can lead to cancer\n\nAnd you don't think she'd be tested for hpv? Also, 80% of the population has/have had hpv. Most people never know the have it. So this should account for anyone who has ever had sex.\nAlso, most people with hpv, does show symptoms, and it's relatively safe. You can also get a vaccine for hpv. \n\n>Absolutely not okay for you to hide your exponentially increased risk and expose your partner without their consent.\n\nI've had a pretty active sex life, should I share everything about it to a new partner... Just in case I might have caught an std a few years ago? And should I share all the STDs I have ever HAD?", "Finally someone with a bit of knowledge. The Venn diagram between people who think what  OP did was fine and who knows nothing about sex work is a perfect circle. Telling that.", "When those boundaries are born out of bigotry, then no. Just like I'm going to call bs on those bigoted preferences on grindr. Like, \"it's just my preference\" is not a defense of being a vile bigot.", "No they don\u2019t deserve to know because it doesn\u2019t concern them, again that was in their past and if they wish their past was left there then they aren\u2019t obligated to share that.\nEdit: I\u2019d like to add it\u2019s certainly not someone else\u2019s place to tell someone else.", "Curious where you came across that ? I\u2019ve read they\u2019re almost 60x more likely to have STIs than the general population", "I don't. It ignores my biggest issue with OP: the nasty blind siding which reeks of vengeful and punitive judgement.", ">Do you disclose every single person you\u2019ve had sex with to all your partners?\n\nYes, I do, but not because I feel that I have to justify myself or that it reflects my moral value. I think honesty is very important in a relationship. SIL should have told their husband. But OP had precisely zero right to disclose this information to their brother. They have absolutely no idea what SIL has been through, and it doesn\u2019t seem like they outed her in good faith - it was an attempt to sl*t shame her and cause tension in her marriage. It\u2019s none of OP\u2019s business.", "If I had a job that I know is going to be a potential dealbreaker for people, then yes. Why wouldn't I? I would be wasting everyone's time otherwise. \n\n>Real sick of people acting like doing sex work makes someone damaged goods when it's clear you assholes are the damaged ones\n\nWhy would anyone want to be in a relationship with someone who thinks of them as damaged goods? If someone thinks my previous job makes me damaged goods, I do not want to continue that relationship. Why would you support people having to lie and hide things about themselves to appease people you perceive as assholes? You are inconsistent in your judgment.", "It's not the same as any other job, although usually past jobs do come up in normal conversation and the way OP describes it, Sarah was clearly hiding her past, not just failing to bring it up because it wasn't important. It might not be important to you, but it doesn't matter what you think about it though because other people are allowed to have their own opinions that are different from your opinions and for a lot of other people, it is important. If someone thinks that doing sex work does make someone \"damaged goods\" as you say, they are allowed to feel that way. And maybe a former sex worker should not want to be in a relationship with someone who has that mentality so, at the end of the day, honesty is still the best policy. The issue at hand is the lying about it, not whether or not the brother is ok with her past. That's up to him to decide, but he wasn't given a chance to decide because he was lied to.", "It's perfectly valid to not date former/active military/police people, why is it not valid to not want to date former/active sex workers? The brother should have been told by SIL so that he could have made up his mind about it before marriage.", "Not the point,  if i had a job i felt i should hind...i may need to let my SO in on it BEFORE we swear loyalty. Its not just the sex work, for me it's the lie you portray daily/weekly/monthly/yearly. \nAnd what happens after they have children and one of her former clients recognizes her at school meeting...gonna wait years to break his trust of what he believes of his wife?", "I think it\u2019s wild that you\u2019re trying to compare benign office jobs to SEX WORK. Sex means something to me. If you\u2019re willing to sleep with randos and get paid for it, that\u2019s your prerogative but it tells me we have very different views on sex. And those views are very much a dealbreaker for many people.", "I'm 42, it happens. But not as often as it used to. We've all been round the block a few times by now.", "Truly curios. Why do you differentiate between seller and buyer? Doesn\u2019t that give the impression that you think all sex workers are victims and all sex buyers predators? There are shades on both sides. \n\nI live in a country where it\u2019s legal to sell and illegal to buy. Police will wait after the money has changed hands to arrest the buyer. I agree with this law since a law is there to protect the victims. But a law has to be black and white. A person dating can have a more open mind.", "Actually it is. \n\nI would not ever date any man who\u2019d voted for trump, or worked on a trump political campaign/legal defence. I just could not date a person who would ever further a career that has caused endless hate and violence. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have the same feeling about him, you don\u2019t have to agree with me, but whom I date is still my choice and I\u2019m allowed to impose my boundaries on it. Sex work history is a significantly divisive issue. You tell potential serious partners before you marry them so they are able to make an informed decision whether or not to date you.", "Is her past and she had the right to not tell, as is her husband right to not be ok with it. That's why is better to be honest about it. If not, she must accept that her husbands reaction is a consequence of her not telling the truth about her past, not that someone else found out and told him.\n\nTo be honest if you don't tell these kind of stuff to your significant other, I would be worndering what other things you might hide from him if I found out. I think that the brother did nothing wrong.", "I can think of all kinds of jobs in someone's past work history that would be relevant when deciding if I want to move forward in a relationship with that person.   \n\n\nIf any of my previous occupations had involved, for instance, producing fentanyl, dealing drugs, scamming old people out of their retirement funds, selling stolen cars, fencing stolen property, selling time shares or doing MLM, working in porn or sex work, so on and so forth, I'd know damn well that'd be a deal breaker for a lot of potential partners.  \n\n\nIf I was an animal rights activist and the person I was dating had worked at a slaughterhouse and had killed thousands of animals, that would be relevant to me, and very likely a deal breaker,  \n\n\nIf I was an environmental activist and the person I was dating had been a logger who cut down old growth forests, that would be relevant to me, and very likely a deal breaker.    \n\n\nIf I was involved in social justice causes and supported BLM and the person I was dating used to be a cop, that would be very relevant to me, and a deal breaker.", "Exactly this. When OP said she wasn't open about her past it made it obvious to me that she's obviously at least told her husband she has a painful/difficult past.", "It's wild because \"amateurs\" in ANY other kind of work are looked down upon.  \"He's a bum cause his podcast is for fun whereas his brother is successful because he gets paid for having 2M viewers on his podcast\"", "WTH? Being in a relationship is not the same as being friends. You need similar views on the things that are important to you.\n\nYou are the bigoted one thinking you have the right to push people into wanting a relationship with you. You have the right to be treated like less of a human in your everyday life, you have the right to be taken seriously, you have not the right to decide who should be ok to be in a relationship with you. That's when you are trampling on other people's human right to choose. See where you stopped being a good person and start to be a bad person?", "You don\u2019t think someone should be aware of a partners criminal history if it\u2019s something that would influence whether or not they continue with a relationship and it was hidden from them?", "It probably depends on the population. In places where it's legal they're much more likely to be using good safe sex practices and I believe in new south Wales Australia it's common to do a visual inspection before commencing with a booking? I'm not 100% on that last part tho.", "You can acknowledge that OP's brother deserved the right to make an informed decision about his relationship while also thinking that the way OP went about things strongly makes them an arsehole.", "Punitive judgement... but its ok for you.", "Wow equating sex workers with violent murderers? Go straight to hell.", "No, I don't care about having an open mind after talking with former prostitutes (most of them are victims, yes, because I am not referring to the \"luxurious minority\" of rich escorts) and listening to their horror stories about sex buyers. \"Gentle clients\" is basically a myth; those men were always brutal, demanding and dehumanising them as body parts, and basically no one cared to check if the woman was trafficked or not, or checking in when they started dissociating, vomiting or anything. If you were a sex buyer I am just not interested in dating you because I feel repulsed.", "Sure, there.are \"shades\" or whatever. Some, very, very few though, women will choose to go into sex work. But even then it is usually because they have no other choice. Go hungry or sell the only thing you have. Usually though they are coerced into it by a man, usually at a very young illegal age. Or they are addicted to drugs and that is the only way they can score. Which I don't view as a choice. So yeah, like 99.9 percent ARE victims. While the perv buying is buying into the abuse. Sorry, not sorry. Take a girl out on a date and be kind and she will probably give it up nowadays. So... yeah", ">whom I date is still my choice and I\u2019m allowed to impose my boundaries on it.\n\nYes, and that is the persons/husbands responsibility to mention it, not the other way around.", "Agreed. Working with kids, working in a service/restaurant industry, working in nursing aide. I got the flu several times, many colds, measles, chicken pox, mono, shingles. All from those jobs. \n\nI\u2019d rather marry a sex worker than a prude who nosy gossips and potentially ruins a happy marriage because OMG ThE SeCRet and ThE DraMa!! \n\nShe could have been a no-contact Dom. She could have been in desperate circumstances. She could have been any kinds of situations that led her to decide her terms about HER body and how SHE wanted to move on afterwards and discuss if and when it was right. \n\nI hope the brother goes non-contact with the OP. YTA OP.", "Well no because you\u2019ve highlighted they\u2019ve changed and they aren\u2019t doing the things they were doing in the past, it\u2019s not hiding it as I\u2019ve said its their past and their choice to share it if they wish.", "That\u2019s my fault for assuming this was happening in the US lol classic American move right there, my bad. Thank you for the info!", "As an ex-SW in that state and country, can confirm; the worker is supposed to do a thorough visual inspection of the customer's genital area, and if anything seems unusual or like it could be an STI, the worker is allowed to decline the booking and the customer gets a refund. At least, that's how it worked in the parlour I worked in, and in parlours in surrounding areas.", "Most people who join the (US) army never leave the country? I am Norwegian, my army protects us from Russia. I would still have doubts over being with a military man though.", "This response alone shows you're incredibly biased on this topic.", "The info is wrong. STI rates are absolutely higher even in countries where it is legal or regulated.", ">it shows you don't value the exclusivity of sex to a relationship.\n\nThat's because sex, by nature, isn't exclusive to relationships.  That is a society set standard decided by organized religion, long ago in the past, as a way to control people.  Part of finding out if you are sexually compatible with someone is well....having sex.  Many people I've spoken with have flat out admitted that if someone hadn't told them that casual sex or being gay or being non-white is a bad thing that shouldn't happen they would have never held that view.  \n\n\n\nAlso, one can get a high number while only having sex while in relationships.  Things relating to sex can be a make or break part of the relationship for some, clearly, the physical aspect included.  Logically yes, if sex compatibility is that important one can go obtainin a high number of relationships to find that overall ideal partner.  You don't necessarily find your perfect partner within the first 3 people you sleep with or are in a relationship with, or the first 30 or whatever other high number you want to pick.  \n\n\nAren't you supposed to leave a relationship if you aren't compatible, and sometimes those incompatibities don't come out within the first 3 weeks of speaking to each other or even casually dating?  Or are people supposed to stay in incompatible relationships out of fear that they find someone who is perfect for them except the most important thing to the other person is a stupid number?", "Did I say that? Where did I say that? I didn't say that. Regardless, if you are monogamous and have a high sex count then you very likely have an issue that you refuse to address that has affected you in so many relationships.", "Lol idk about you, but I'm not religious and have never been around anything like that. So I'm free of anything like that. Which is disgusting btw. I have the preferences I do because I value sex in a relationship to an extreme amount because it is one of the things I bond over the most. So being with someone that doesn't feel the same way, which they don't if they've slept around, is a no go for me. I'm bi btw, and with a man as a man, so it also has absolutely nothing to do with sexism. What's fucked up is you telling others what to and not to be okay with, and presuming their reasoning as why that is."]}
