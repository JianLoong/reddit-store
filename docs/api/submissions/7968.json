Two weeks into the new semester, housing emailed me about filling in the extra room. I agreed but reminded them that I have room accommodations because of my health condition that was already in place to ensure I wasn\u2019t with someone who actively smokes. They agreed and suggested a girls name and told me to reach out to her first before committing. I dmed her and said she had quit smoking and she understood so we agreed to room together.\n\nToday she officially moved in with all her stuff with the help of her friends. When we had a moment alone she told me to tell her if I had any problems with her friends coming over often since they smoke cigarettes and vape. I told her I don\u2019t have a problem so long as it\u2019s not in the room. She said she\u2019d be firm with her friends and told them they can absolutely not smoke or vape in her or my room. Her friends seemed kind of annoyed when she told them when I was right there so I partially closed my door but I could hear her kick one of them out when he pulled out his vape. He asked if she was joking and told him \u201cno,she has a lung condition you can\u2019t do it in here.\u201d I didn\u2019t hear what he said exactly but he was mumbling on his way out. \n\nThe interaction bothered me although she was strongly defending my wishes which I appreciate. Smoking is really normalized on campus and I don\u2019t want to be the person that comes across as needing special treatment and condemning their choices. Especially since I have roommate who is holding up her end of our agreement, is it right for me to also say her friends can\u2019t smoke either?

I can tend to be over sensitive with health triggers even if they\u2019re small but on campus I hear a lot of opposing opinions to mine when it comes to smoking so I genuinely wanted to know if i was in the wrong towards them. I do understand your point tho and certainly will keep in mind and reflect on", "It\u2019s true, our dorm rules don\u2019t allow smoking inside. Yet so many people on campus (mind you it\u2019s a small school) disregard that and vape in their rooms anyways. The people who do openly smoke often complain when someone tells them to stop or makes a comment about what they\u2019re doing. (ofc not everyone is like that but some of my encounters have)"]}
