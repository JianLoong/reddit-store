We usually only had short-term placements, around 4-8 months or so. Then 2 years ago, we had \"Kayden\" placed with us. He was 4 at the time. It was supposed to be another short-term placement but then things changed and it became clear he was going to be with us for a while. After a year, we were told his plan was likely changing to adoption. We decided we would if that happened. Eventually, we were told we were going to be able to.\n\nMy brother's wife \"Denise\" (40F) was adopted at birth and originally, was a great resource for us. We've always done our research to be trauma-informed and best help any child in our care. Things were fine until we shared we were going to adopt Kayden. Denise said that we were stealing a child from his family and we should fight to keep him with his family-despite no family stepping up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, in the end, a relative \\*did\\* step up and applied for kinship. They received custody of Kayden and will likely adopt them. It is truly the best thing for Kayden to stay in the family, but it doesn't mean that it isn't extremely hard on everyone involved. We raised him for 2 years, love him, soothed every nightmare, fever, etc. We built a bond. It was also hard to explain to him why it went from \"We're adopting you!\" to \"You're going to live with (insert relative that he didn't know well)\". Kayden was reunited with the family member in January after only a 1 week's notice. The family has also decided we shouldn't see Kayden. It's their right and we understand-but we've been essentially cut off from his life and we'll never see him again. It's hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I have gone through a grieving period. We decided to take a break from fostering. We recognize this was the best thing, but it doesn't make it any easier. Most of our family has been pretty understanding and supportive as we work through our grieving. Everyone except Denise. She keeps saying what a wonderful thing this is and we need to stop being sad, that it's not about us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Saturday, she and my brother came over. We were having a decent day until I came across a picture of Kayden on my phone. I got a little teary and had to leave the room for a moment. I returned and apologized. Denise got snippy and said \"You need to cut this out. He wasn't your child. This is what's best for him. If you truly loved him, you'd be over this by now\". I was still kind of upset and mixed with everything I was going through, I screamed at her that she was an insensitive little bitch and she only looks through things from her perspective. I said I understand she resents her adoptive parents but that doesn't mean we were wrong for wanting to adopt Kayden. She tried arguing with me but I threw her out of my house. She left in a huff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother has since called and said he understands that Denise is \"candid\" but I was wrong to scream at her and I could've handled it better.

I would immediately be attached. \n\nTwo years is a long time, especially in those early years of development. In an odd way, this is very much like a breakup, there's a greiving process and it will take a long time. If you have the resources, I would suggest possibly counseling to help develop coping mechanisms. \n\nAs for your SIL, it sounds like her reaction was coming from a place of related trauma. You absolutely shouldn't be over it by now, anyone who says you should be isn't thinking clearly or lacks empathy.", "NTA - you are perfectly capable of being glad that kayden is with his birth family and will have a permanent home while also grieving the loss of someone you cared for and loved dearly and was part of your family", "NTA. To start, you and your husband are wonderful people for fostering and being ready to adopt. Good on you for having the emotional awareness to grieve and take a needed break.\n\nPoint blank period, your SIL has no compassion. Sorry for whatever emotions she dealt with being adopted. But that does NOT give her any right to try to invalidate your feelings. And your feelings are completely VALID. She was cruel. You did not deserve that. There is no timeline for you to miss this child ever.\n\nI hope you can see all the good you did for Kayden. Know that your love made a difference during this time period. Bless your family, now and in the future.", "NTA it's like she's taking every opportunity to rub in how she was \"right\" when you're not saying she wasn't, you're just having understandable sad emotions about the situation. It's not like you're looking at Kayden's picture and going \"we need to go to that charlatan's house and take him back right now!\" I'm glad you were able to do what was best for Kayden, and I'm sorry that it's caused you so much pain; the two are not mutually exclusive and it seems like you realize that and Denise missed the memo.   \n   \nEdit to add: also, it's only been around a month or two after you bonded with him for 2 years and were preparing to adopt him. Denise comes off as really cold even with her own adoption history factoring in.", "NTA. Your SIL is trying to foist her own history, value system and judgments on you, after you loved that child and committed yourself to him. \n\nYou are allowed to grieve his loss, even if it ends up being good for him.\n\nGod bless you for your open and ready heart. \n\nThe world needs more people like you.", "NTA.  You effectively lost a child.  It's absolutely okay to grieve that, and Denise is wrong to insist you should not.", "NTA.  I both am sad and happy Kayden is with his family since you sound like you really really loved him.  Your SIL needs to work out her issues with her childhood before spewing her bullshit on everyone.  Plenty of kids NEED to be taken from shitty parents.  Did she know anything about his background before unilaterally saying the family would be better? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy aunt was adopted from abusive parents who put cigarettes out on her when she was 7 months old, I wonder if your crappy SIL would think she would have been better off with the abusers?", "NTA you were just being candid\n\nIf it's any comfort remind yourself you were there for that little boy when he needed you and gave him all the love you could.", "NTA.

I can\u2019t imagine the pain and grief that you\u2019re experiencing. Compounding all this was your SIL showing horrid behavior and gross insensitivity. \n\nYour brother should\u2019ve told her to stop.

Your grief is valid and no one should diminish it.  I hope you have a better support system elsewhere to get through this loss.  Contrary to her corrosive opinion, for most adoptive parents, we love our kids just the same as if we gave birth to them.

More real than many biological mothers are to their kids.", "NTA. WOW, your sil needs therapy asap. Not every adopted child has the same experiences.

But wow, SIL is a massive one.  You can't turn your feelings on and off like that.", "NTA. It's completely understandable that you still have feelings toward Kayden. There was a genuine chance you would adopt him. While Denise is probably right that it's best for him, she is being unkind and unsympathetic to your feelings. I don't blame you for yelling at her", "NTA. Your brother is a fool and you don't need to tolerate his wife's insensitivity.

Your SIL\u2019s behavior was appalling.

It is indeed about you.  Also, thank you for being foster parents.    You are NTA.", "NTA and I'm so sorry you're having to go through that. You were absolutely right about everything you said to your SIL, and she should be ashamed of herself for being so apathetic and projecting her trauma onto you and your husband.", "NTA. As a kid that was in foster care... Denise has her personal issues to deal with that basically has nothing to do with your experience. \nI find it weird that this child's family would decide you don't matter and make the choice to cut you out. You loved him and cared for him and if it was me, I would respect that. It takes a village. \nI really hope you guys decide to be foster parents again in the future. PLEASE. There are so many kids that need love. Ignore Denise. Give your love to these little kids. They really need it. I do hope you are able to adopt a foster child in the future. It's my dream, also.", "NTA. You had every right to be angered by Denise's response. Could it have been handled better? Sure, but that doesn't mean you were in the wrong. Tell your brother you apologize for the outburst, but not the message. Tell Denise to eff off.", "NTA Your SIL was rude and, ironically, failed to think about Kayden's feelings. While I would agree that a family placement is best in most situations, I think this should be done BEFORE the kid spends TWO YEARS bonding with another family and told he's being adopted. At this point, ripping him away from the only family he can probably remember and handing him to a stranger seems horribly traumatic and not in his best interests.", "NTA- while I\u2019m glad the perspectives are shifting from being foster parent/case management agency focused to child focused, foster parents who care for children like you did will definitely form an attachment and mourn/grieve when they leave, regardless of situation. As someone who worked in CPS case management, I worked with a lot of foster parents like you, and I wish we had more. \n\nPersonally, I think cutting y\u2019all off \u201ccold turkey\u201d might be harder for Kayden, and a therapist should be making that call. He\u2019s had so much disruption in his life and even as young as he is, this is impactful, esp when he\u2019s being placed back with someone who he doesn\u2019t know without the one support he DID have. They can make a decision that\u2019s best for Kayden. I know you might not be able to control any of that, but please feel validated with any feelings that you may have about the situation. \n\nFinally, just like with any relationship we nurture and then suddenly lose, there is a grieving period. You and your partner may need to have a discussion about future foster placements. While your SIL was being rude and harsh, foster kids are exactly that, children the State trusts others to care for in one of the most vulnerable times of their lives. If your response is like this, you might want to consider speaking to your foster care case manager and/or a therapist to figure out the best path forward as well. These kids can come to you with some severe trauma and may stay a while, they may come in and out, or they may only be with you for a brief time. Please love them as much as you loved Kayden, but also please take care of yourself too. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. She was being very insensitive.", "NTA, someone told me that it is easier to grieve the death of a person you love than it is to grieve the loss of relationship with someone still alive.  You know that death is final and you know why the person left you.  The loss of the relationship, it is like an open wound.  You may see the person alone or with their new person.  Wondering what you did to make them leave you. \n\nThis follows you.  You love the child when nobody else from his family stepped up to adopt him. You gave the boy a home with parents.  Your sister in law, should understand this better than most.  Then when you're finalizing the process someone from the family steps in and takes the child from you.  Then they make it so you can't reach out to see him.  You can't see him grow, have birthdays and special occasions.  That is a momentous loss to you.  You know he is alive, but you can't have that relationship anymore.  That hurts, hurts a lot.  Your SIL should hope she never has to feel that pain.\n\nI hope the boy has gone to a safe relative.  One that will not hand him back to the original parents, sidestepping conditions that made the child in orphan in the first plate.  I hope things change for the better.  Maybe, start a little fund for college or a house.  If he searches you out you could give it to him.", "Nta", "NTA. Quite correct over your comments to her, your brother could handle it better.", "NTA she sounds awful. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. She is making a generalization based on her own personal experience. Every situation is different. She shouldn\u2019t try to impose her own beliefs and try to discredit your love for the child.", "I feel for you, OP. I experienced the same loss as a teen to toddler siblings growing up in a home where my parents did fostercare. It\u2019s was the worst kind of grieving because you are met with this loss while life still goes on with them in another\u2019s and you just get completely shut out with little to no warning.\n\nWe know it\u2019s right for the child (no we don\u2019t, but we have to tell ourselves this) and I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out the way you had hoped which was in your little guys best interest at the time and based on the info you had available to you.

It's not like it's unheard of to hear someone describe their family as horrible monsters only to meet them and find out they were absolutely wonderful, kind people who set perfectly reasonable boundaries and expectations. ~~With how unfeeling and \"candid\" this woman is, plus her blood tie bigotry I wouldn't be super surprised~~.(Edit: And I repeat, I wouldn't have been surprised. Not super surprised that she does have solid trauma on that either.)\n\nNTA OP\n\nEdit: OP requested I delete my speculation due to knowing Denise's history, but speculations are valid in this sub because that's how we work around and judge an issue. Plus, just because the trauma's suffered by adopted children doesn't mean that negative feelings on adoption are always the adopted parents fault. It also shouldn't overshadow all of the *very* real abuse provided by \"blood\" families to their many, many victims. I've known a couple of folks that very much wish they had been taken away and adopted out as kids. So no, I won't be fully deleting my post because while it may not be the truth in this case, it can't be discounted in others.

She had been with us 2 years and there was no end in sight to her case. After hanging on by a thread for a whole year longer than I was really able to, my husband and I decided to close our home and let our foster license expire. We gave over 3 month\u2019s notice, thinking that would be plenty of time for them to find an adoptive placement and start the transition process. We were SOOOO wrong. There is a shortage of foster beds in our county and on any given day there are anywhere from 10-30 kids that have been removed but have nowhere to go for the night. Placement\u2019s #1 focus is on finding beds for those kids TONIGHT so they don\u2019t end up sleeping on an office floor (it happens more than anyone is willing to admit). Our fd was already in a safe place so she was not priority. They literally waited until 24HOURS before our license was to expire before they found her a new placement.\n\nThere are COUNTLESS other inefficiencies that make transitions in foster care difficult. Out of state transfers are even worse.", "My husband and I looked into and while I know he would have been great, it would have been too emotionally grueling for me to get through the departures (especially knowing I might be returning kids to less than stable situations).

I had a friend who was always talking about how awful her parents were, and then I met them and realized that her parents were really caring and were just tip toeing around her all the time because they were so terrified of upsetting her and never hearing from her again.

The adoptive placement and the foster parents also don\u2019t always have any control over the transition plan especially if there are long distances involved and ESPECIALLY if the transfer is out of state. Even the no contact thing is not so cut and dried. It is very common to cut off contact (sometimes temporarily) with the theory being that it allows the child to bond more quickly to the new family. There\u2019s also the issue of the adults building a relationship and trust with each other. When my fd of 2 years left our home, I had to build trust with her new family and let them learn that I was not interested in stomping any of their boundaries or going to change my mind and try to take her back. They had had previous bad experiences so that time of building trust was important.", "It\u2019s unfortunate that Denise had to live within that family situation.

Your grief and sorrow is valid.\n\nYour SIL is deeply, deeply traumatized and that is mangling her message. Please understand that many adult adoptees feel that a great injustice has been perpetrated against them while society demands they remain ever childlike and grateful for adoption. It is very traumatizing to see people engaging in adoption not only uncritically, but with enthusiasm. It's like watching people get off on your trauma. It wounds us.\n\nAnd the way adoption is often framed, the adopters are the more important (or most important) players. We will hear about how terrible it is when mothers change their mind and keep their babies. What an enormous loss that is for the potential adopters. But very rarely do we talk openly about the loss birth mothers AND their children deal with all of their lives.\n\nWhen people are discussing foster care/adoption, they speak about the birth parents with a level of hatred and vitriol usually only reserved for p3dophiles, EVEN THOUGH the vast vast vast vast vast majority of foster care cases are due to neglect and not abuse. The foster parents are uncritically seen as heroic saviors of horribly abused children rather than participants in a system that would rather remove children from their impoverished parents and pay \"better\" people to raise them than to just support birth parents.\n\nIt's hard being a birth parent and it's horrible being an adult adoptee who is critical of the systems of adoption on any level. We are shut down almost immediately.\n\nSo, let me say this. You chose to be a foster parent, so you chose to be in this situation. You are participating in a system that is pretty dysfunctional, so you should know that you will get push back from people in society.

Shit, my mom likes my sister more than me now that she had the first grandkid \ud83e\udd23\n\nedit: but yeah, im sure it wouldve crushed my parents had my sister and brother been put back with family after 4-5 years of caring for them. They would have done it, but it would have hurt because at that point they had so much care and love for them", "Your SIL is the AH and so is your brother.", "Denise is telling you how you should grieve the loss of a child you loved. (I know he didn't pass, but to you and your husband it's as if he did, and it's quite OK to grieve that you will never see that person ever again)\n\nHow dare she? No one can tell another how to grieve. She really crossed the line here and I am glad you threw her out of your house. \n\nI would be telling my brother that she was not welcome back until Denise had apologized to me and my husband. (Candid or not!)\n\nI hope you also might consider  looking into counseling, if only for a short time, to help you through this grieving process.\n\nYou also might look up online support groups. \n\nPlease also know that grief may come upon you at inopportune times, something may trigger it and it's Okay to be sad (scream, cry, etc.)\n\nNTA but Denise can keep her obviously unresolved trauma far away from me.", "NTA. So sorry for your loss. That\u2019s very difficult. Sending much love and strength to you for your healing journey.", "I'm adopted and you're NTA.  Denise is.  Yes, it's generally better to be raised by your family of origin, but her inability to see your side of it is horrible.", "NTA you are grieving a loss. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re selfish, you still gave him up and put him first, you\u2019re not making him watch your grief, there was literally no rational reason to attack you. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, you and your hubby sound like amazing people. I\u2019m glad you told your SIL off and don\u2019t back down. Her behavior was disgusting.", "NTA.  Time to be equally 'candid' and let your brother know he and his wife are no longer welcome in your home and may no longer be welcome in your life.   His lack of support for you and his enabling her 'candid' words against you have terribly damaged your relationship with him and destroyed your relationship with her.", "NTA. Denise is a jerk. You're legitimately grieving. Your SIL has no heart.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for yourself. I'm so sorry for your loss. Maybe one day how family will realize that love is the one thing you can keep and give away at the same time. Hugs.", "Heartbreaking why? The purpose of foster care is reunification", "\n\n>Candid? Is that what we're calling assholes these days? Quick someone create r/AmICandid \n\nBuhahahahahahahhahahahah i laughed out loud. Best comment ever", "\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf77\n\nThe free drinks I'd like to buy you.  Candidly.  Because a synonym for the stupid euphemism \"I'm just being HONEST\" should always be called out for the assholery.\n\nKudos.", "I think this is a subset of 'brutally honest'.   Heavy on the brutal, light on the honest.", "That assumes that op wants to 'get together some other time'.  And nobody is angry?  Really?", "Because she is in deep and obvious pain, and I have empathy for her.", "She's deliberately nasty.  Do you want this in your life?", "This right here is the issue and what makes OP not the AH, but the other party very much so.\n\nIf this were a case where the foster parent was harassing the child or adoptive parent(s) I think that comment would not have been off-base; even if it still could have been expressed better.  But shaming someone just for grieving in their own home??  Nope.", "Exactly. If Bio family was always best, there wouldnt BE a foster system!", "Same here. It takes a special combination of grace and fortitude to bond properly with children in need and then let them go. It\u2019s something I wish more people were aware of when they blithely suggest \u201cif you\u2019re infertile and can\u2019t afford to adopt, you could foster!\u201d It\u2019s not a shortcut to adoption, it\u2019s a whole different, often emotionally harrowing, situation.", "And do we even know Denise had bad adoptive parents? Or does she just have some fabricated mythologized image of her bio family because she doesnt know them?", "Nah, the poop knife was helpful", "Thank you, this was a bit of pop culture I'd missed but had no desire to google.", "NTA. Tell Denise that she \"needs to stop being [m]ad\" and \"should be over this by now\" and to STFU. This isn't about her. She needs to stop centering herself.", "NTA.", "NTA op it\u2019s hard the pain Will get less but there will always be times when it hurts. I know it\u2019s not the same but once my mum fostered a 2 year old boy we had him for 3 years and one day social services said he would be adopted. I used to cry myself to sleep every night because I know he would go away someday. After a year social services said he was to old to be adopted and he would go into long term foster care. My mum said she would adopt him so I never have to lose him. we started the adoption process but my dad decided why we where going through the process he would like to divorce my mum and social services did not want him to be part of a broken family because it is to damaging for a foster child so they moved him to a new placement I never saw him again.", "She seems awful. Her story of adoption is not the only story and she has no right to insinuate that it is.\n\nShe is the AH", "NTA. She\u2019s insensitive and cruel. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Fellow foster mom here and she\u2019s wrong on so many levels. I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this difficulty and I hope your heart finds peace.", "I am a recent foster to a 13 year old boy that is \"planning\" to be temporary. The thought of him leaving already saddens me. I can't imagine how painful it was for you. My condolences.\n\nNTA by the way", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It\u2019s clear you loved Kayden, and he was lucky to have you. I hope you\u2019re able to heal the hole he left in your heart. NTA obviously", "Her experience isn't every experience. NTA.", "I am usually riddled with painful, boring nuance and caveat my NTAs. Not here. NTA.\n\nDenise is allowing the trauma and insecurity of her own experience to translate into treating you with appalling insensitivity. She deserves to be told off, and your tone/language is the least of the issue. I hope Kayden has a lovely life with his new family and I hope you eventually are able to make peace with what has happened and move on. In the meantime, feel your feelings and keep Denise out of your house.", "SIL needs to learn that her triggers are her problem and no one else\u2019s. she\u2019s been saying this stuff and dismissing your feelings from the beginning. I wonder if she resents the love you have for Kayden because she never felt it from her adoptive parents and she\u2019s jealous of him.", "NTA.\n\nYOU are allowed to grieve which is its own messy process. Denise needs to get over herself and your brother needs to stop enabling her behavior.", "NTA.\n\nDenise was wrong to keep harping on a sore subject. Shutting up is free. Tell your brother that.", "I would never talk to the selfish self-absorbed brat again. It's not also the case that he is better off with a relative. I doubt they would be as good as you.", "Wow that was created fast", "r/birthofasub", "Denise is certainly something that starts with a c, but candid was not the term I was looking for.", "I was just trying to suggest a 'political solution to avoid future drama. But based on th enumber of downvoted many do not agree with this. Oh well.", "I\u2019ve been where you are and just wanted to let you know that the hurt will stop.\nWe fostered neonatal abstinence babies from birth to adoption. They were usually with us for around a year. However, one little girl was with us for 3.5 years. From 2 weeks old.\nWhen she left to live with her adoptive family (they also refused any further contact with us), we grieved and we grieved hard.\n\nIt was exactly like a death in the family and until you have lived through it you cannot know how much it hurts.\n\nShe left 11 years ago and we never fostered again because when she left she took our hearts with her and we never really managed to put the pieces back together again.\nHowever, it\u2019s easier to live with now. She\u2019s on Facebook and I looked her up. I didn\u2019t reach out, I just looked and she is healthy, happy, thriving and above all loved.\n\nYou will get through this and eventually you\u2019ll be able to remember this little one and smile at the memories without crying.\n\nYou are NTA at all. You are a grieving parent. Allow yourself that.", "Some people really lack empathy or basic social cues. It's not really a smart idea to argue your point when it's clearly not the time. You were crying and upset and Denise saying \"you need to get over it\" obviously wasn't gonna magically make you get over anything \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nOf course your brother will stand up for his wife but I don't blame you for kicking her out.", "She entered *your* grieving period \n\nTo *insult your grieving* \n\nI'll never understand when the person who should have kept their mouth shut isnt seen as the problem, \nIt's always the person who *is expected to take the verbal lash* \nWho's in the wrong if they don't take it. \n\nUgh infuriating. Nta I'm so sorry for your emotional loss and any kid is lucky to be placed with you, I know this child will remember you in his heart forever\u2661\n\nPlus for all she knows he's crying and missing you guys too! \nIt's so much more emotions involved then your sl grasps.", "I\u2019m not a foster parent or parent, but I am a nanny. I was with one girl for 5 years, starting when she was 2 months old. I left because she was starting kindergarten. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the same thing, even though I was with her 45+ hours a week for 5 years. \n\nI cried every single day for a *month*. It slowly got better, and her parents allowed me to stay in her life. I still grieved. I constantly wondered how she was doing, thought of her schedule every time I looked at the clock, etc. It was heartbreaking. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine the grieving process when a foster child is suddenly ripped away and no further contact is allowed. \n\nI\u2019m so thankful that my friends and family were supportive, even if some of them didn\u2019t understand the bond I had with her. Nannying isn\u2019t *just* a job, the way that fostering isn\u2019t *just* housing a child. Oof, I\u2019m tearing up for OP for losing their child, not being able to communicate with them, AND dealing with their horrible sister.", "It\u2019s actually better for them in the long run. I speak from experience as a pre adoption foster carer. There should be a visit after 4-6 months but then that\u2019s it. I had my heart destroyed by the last little one I fostered .(for 3.5 years from 2 weeks old), but ultimately it IS better for them so they can make and maintain attachments to their family.
