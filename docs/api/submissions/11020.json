We usually only had short-term placements, around 4-8 months or so. Then 2 years ago, we had \"Kayden\" placed with us. He was 4 at the time. It was supposed to be another short-term placement but then things changed and it became clear he was going to be with us for a while. After a year, we were told his plan was likely changing to adoption. We decided we would if that happened. Eventually, we were told we were going to be able to.\n\nMy brother's wife \"Denise\" (40F) was adopted at birth and originally, was a great resource for us. We've always done our research to be trauma-informed and best help any child in our care. Things were fine until we shared we were going to adopt Kayden. Denise said that we were stealing a child from his family and we should fight to keep him with his family-despite no family stepping up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, in the end, a relative \\*did\\* step up and applied for kinship. They received custody of Kayden and will likely adopt them. It is truly the best thing for Kayden to stay in the family, but it doesn't mean that it isn't extremely hard on everyone involved. We raised him for 2 years, love him, soothed every nightmare, fever, etc. We built a bond. It was also hard to explain to him why it went from \"We're adopting you!\" to \"You're going to live with (insert relative that he didn't know well)\". Kayden was reunited with the family member in January after only a 1 week's notice. The family has also decided we shouldn't see Kayden. It's their right and we understand-but we've been essentially cut off from his life and we'll never see him again. It's hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I have gone through a grieving period. We decided to take a break from fostering. We recognize this was the best thing, but it doesn't make it any easier. Most of our family has been pretty understanding and supportive as we work through our grieving. Everyone except Denise. She keeps saying what a wonderful thing this is and we need to stop being sad, that it's not about us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Saturday, she and my brother came over. We were having a decent day until I came across a picture of Kayden on my phone. I got a little teary and had to leave the room for a moment. I returned and apologized. Denise got snippy and said \"You need to cut this out. He wasn't your child. This is what's best for him. If you truly loved him, you'd be over this by now\". I was still kind of upset and mixed with everything I was going through, I screamed at her that she was an insensitive little bitch and she only looks through things from her perspective. I said I understand she resents her adoptive parents but that doesn't mean we were wrong for wanting to adopt Kayden. She tried arguing with me but I threw her out of my house. She left in a huff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother has since called and said he understands that Denise is \"candid\" but I was wrong to scream at her and I could've handled it better.

I would immediately be attached. \n\nTwo years is a long time, especially in those early years of development. In an odd way, this is very much like a breakup, there's a greiving process and it will take a long time. If you have the resources, I would suggest possibly counseling to help develop coping mechanisms. \n\nAs for your SIL, it sounds like her reaction was coming from a place of related trauma. You absolutely shouldn't be over it by now, anyone who says you should be isn't thinking clearly or lacks empathy.", "NTA - you are perfectly capable of being glad that kayden is with his birth family and will have a permanent home while also grieving the loss of someone you cared for and loved dearly and was part of your family", "NTA. To start, you and your husband are wonderful people for fostering and being ready to adopt. Good on you for having the emotional awareness to grieve and take a needed break.\n\nPoint blank period, your SIL has no compassion. Sorry for whatever emotions she dealt with being adopted. But that does NOT give her any right to try to invalidate your feelings. And your feelings are completely VALID. She was cruel. You did not deserve that. There is no timeline for you to miss this child ever.\n\nI hope you can see all the good you did for Kayden. Know that your love made a difference during this time period. Bless your family, now and in the future.", "NTA it's like she's taking every opportunity to rub in how she was \"right\" when you're not saying she wasn't, you're just having understandable sad emotions about the situation. It's not like you're looking at Kayden's picture and going \"we need to go to that charlatan's house and take him back right now!\" I'm glad you were able to do what was best for Kayden, and I'm sorry that it's caused you so much pain; the two are not mutually exclusive and it seems like you realize that and Denise missed the memo.   \n   \nEdit to add: also, it's only been around a month or two after you bonded with him for 2 years and were preparing to adopt him. Denise comes off as really cold even with her own adoption history factoring in.", "NTA. Your SIL is trying to foist her own history, value system and judgments on you, after you loved that child and committed yourself to him. \n\nYou are allowed to grieve his loss, even if it ends up being good for him.\n\nGod bless you for your open and ready heart. \n\nThe world needs more people like you.", "NTA.  You effectively lost a child.  It's absolutely okay to grieve that, and Denise is wrong to insist you should not.", "NTA.  I both am sad and happy Kayden is with his family since you sound like you really really loved him.  Your SIL needs to work out her issues with her childhood before spewing her bullshit on everyone.  Plenty of kids NEED to be taken from shitty parents.  Did she know anything about his background before unilaterally saying the family would be better? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy aunt was adopted from abusive parents who put cigarettes out on her when she was 7 months old, I wonder if your crappy SIL would think she would have been better off with the abusers?", "NTA you were just being candid\n\nIf it's any comfort remind yourself you were there for that little boy when he needed you and gave him all the love you could.", "NTA.

I can\u2019t imagine the pain and grief that you\u2019re experiencing. Compounding all this was your SIL showing horrid behavior and gross insensitivity. \n\nYour brother should\u2019ve told her to stop.

Your grief is valid and no one should diminish it.  I hope you have a better support system elsewhere to get through this loss.  Contrary to her corrosive opinion, for most adoptive parents, we love our kids just the same as if we gave birth to them.

More real than many biological mothers are to their kids.", "NTA. WOW, your sil needs therapy asap. Not every adopted child has the same experiences.

But wow, SIL is a massive one.  You can't turn your feelings on and off like that.", "NTA. It's completely understandable that you still have feelings toward Kayden. There was a genuine chance you would adopt him. While Denise is probably right that it's best for him, she is being unkind and unsympathetic to your feelings. I don't blame you for yelling at her", "NTA. Your brother is a fool and you don't need to tolerate his wife's insensitivity.

Your SIL\u2019s behavior was appalling.

It is indeed about you.  Also, thank you for being foster parents.    You are NTA.", "NTA and I'm so sorry you're having to go through that. You were absolutely right about everything you said to your SIL, and she should be ashamed of herself for being so apathetic and projecting her trauma onto you and your husband.", "NTA. As a kid that was in foster care... Denise has her personal issues to deal with that basically has nothing to do with your experience. \nI find it weird that this child's family would decide you don't matter and make the choice to cut you out. You loved him and cared for him and if it was me, I would respect that. It takes a village. \nI really hope you guys decide to be foster parents again in the future. PLEASE. There are so many kids that need love. Ignore Denise. Give your love to these little kids. They really need it. I do hope you are able to adopt a foster child in the future. It's my dream, also.", "NTA. You had every right to be angered by Denise's response. Could it have been handled better? Sure, but that doesn't mean you were in the wrong. Tell your brother you apologize for the outburst, but not the message. Tell Denise to eff off.", "NTA Your SIL was rude and, ironically, failed to think about Kayden's feelings. While I would agree that a family placement is best in most situations, I think this should be done BEFORE the kid spends TWO YEARS bonding with another family and told he's being adopted. At this point, ripping him away from the only family he can probably remember and handing him to a stranger seems horribly traumatic and not in his best interests.", "NTA- while I\u2019m glad the perspectives are shifting from being foster parent/case management agency focused to child focused, foster parents who care for children like you did will definitely form an attachment and mourn/grieve when they leave, regardless of situation. As someone who worked in CPS case management, I worked with a lot of foster parents like you, and I wish we had more. \n\nPersonally, I think cutting y\u2019all off \u201ccold turkey\u201d might be harder for Kayden, and a therapist should be making that call. He\u2019s had so much disruption in his life and even as young as he is, this is impactful, esp when he\u2019s being placed back with someone who he doesn\u2019t know without the one support he DID have. They can make a decision that\u2019s best for Kayden. I know you might not be able to control any of that, but please feel validated with any feelings that you may have about the situation. \n\nFinally, just like with any relationship we nurture and then suddenly lose, there is a grieving period. You and your partner may need to have a discussion about future foster placements. While your SIL was being rude and harsh, foster kids are exactly that, children the State trusts others to care for in one of the most vulnerable times of their lives. If your response is like this, you might want to consider speaking to your foster care case manager and/or a therapist to figure out the best path forward as well. These kids can come to you with some severe trauma and may stay a while, they may come in and out, or they may only be with you for a brief time. Please love them as much as you loved Kayden, but also please take care of yourself too. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. She was being very insensitive.", "NTA, someone told me that it is easier to grieve the death of a person you love than it is to grieve the loss of relationship with someone still alive.  You know that death is final and you know why the person left you.  The loss of the relationship, it is like an open wound.  You may see the person alone or with their new person.  Wondering what you did to make them leave you. \n\nThis follows you.  You love the child when nobody else from his family stepped up to adopt him. You gave the boy a home with parents.  Your sister in law, should understand this better than most.  Then when you're finalizing the process someone from the family steps in and takes the child from you.  Then they make it so you can't reach out to see him.  You can't see him grow, have birthdays and special occasions.  That is a momentous loss to you.  You know he is alive, but you can't have that relationship anymore.  That hurts, hurts a lot.  Your SIL should hope she never has to feel that pain.\n\nI hope the boy has gone to a safe relative.  One that will not hand him back to the original parents, sidestepping conditions that made the child in orphan in the first plate.  I hope things change for the better.  Maybe, start a little fund for college or a house.  If he searches you out you could give it to him.", "Nta", "NTA. Quite correct over your comments to her, your brother could handle it better.", "NTA she sounds awful. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. She is making a generalization based on her own personal experience. Every situation is different. She shouldn\u2019t try to impose her own beliefs and try to discredit your love for the child.", "I feel for you, OP. I experienced the same loss as a teen to toddler siblings growing up in a home where my parents did fostercare. It\u2019s was the worst kind of grieving because you are met with this loss while life still goes on with them in another\u2019s and you just get completely shut out with little to no warning.\n\nWe know it\u2019s right for the child (no we don\u2019t, but we have to tell ourselves this) and I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out the way you had hoped which was in your little guys best interest at the time and based on the info you had available to you.

Wouldn't it be best for a transition period? It just feels that this would exacerbate the feeling of abandonment in the child, and tack on more trauma.

These children know they have LOTS of family: by birth, by adoption, by choice, and by love.
