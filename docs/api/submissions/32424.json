As you can imagine, this adds up to a lot of people that come over as almost everyone was spouces and children(10 kids, 5 spouses) plus my parents and my aunt and uncle. \n\nEvery year for Christmas, I make sure to get  all the kids decent gifts(adults get gifts too but they are handmade from my shop). Normally I spend around 35$ on each kid but sometimes go more or less depending on the kids likes. My 2 kids on the other hand, get a gift around the same value to unwrap with all the cousin's then they open everything else Christmas morning. \n\nHere's where the problem lies. After the holidays, the kids talk about what they all got. This causes issues because while we aren't rich, my husband and I are well off. This means that we spend way more on our kids. For example, last year my oldest got a ps5, my youngest got a play house. I'm obviously not going to spend that much on all the other kids.\n\nThis year, I was making plans with everyone about when we are hosting . One of my cousins asked me if I was going all out for my kids this year. I said yes but not as much as last year(new bikes). She asked if I was going to buy all the kids new bike or was I just going to flaunt my wealth? When u asked her why would I buy everyone else's kids bikes? Another cousin chimed in that everyone sees how much I spend on my own kids and it's not fair to all the others. I countered by asking if they were spending the same amount on my kids that they are with their own. They told me it wasn't their job to plus I overspend anyway so I can obviously afford it. I told them I have 2 kids, not 10 and that it's their job to buy expensive crap for their own kids. \n\nOur entire family is now fighting with part agreeing that I can spend whatever I want on my own children, part that says my overspending is bad for the other kids and part that says this is stupid.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1701804818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bk5qe/aita_for_overspending_on_my_children_for_christmas/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They aren\u2019t your children and realistically you don\u2019t have to get anyone else a gift if you didn\u2019t want to so the fact that you are is already generous. Your children are yours and deserved to be spoiled on Christmas!", "NTA. When the cousins are there, all is fair and equal. However, beyond that, you\u2019re under zero obligation to set your Christmas budget based on what your siblings want you to spend. Of course you aren\u2019t getting all the kids new bikes! That\u2019s nuts. It\u2019s also perfectly okay for your kids to get them for Christmas. We did that one year with our kids too. Your siblings are being unreasonable.", "NTA, this is stupid. as long as you aren't having your kids open all the stuff at family dinner, than you aren't \"flaunting\" anything.", "NTA\n\nThis is pretty traditional, every kid has one or two things to open at the \"big family event\" and home presents are separate. I think it'd be different if they were bringing their home presents to open in front of everyone but otherwise, they can kick rocks. \n\nThe audacity to say that to you when you're hosting? I would have been much less polite.", "Nta your family is ridiculous and you have no obligation to spend as much on their kids. They are ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nLife is seldom fair so tell these people with their hands in your financial resource pockets they need to concentrate on their own families.   As long as you aren't going into excessive debt, you can spend whatever you want on your kids.   I assume these other kids have parents.    Growing up I would have never even thought that my aunts or uncles were obligated to even buy me a gift, let alone an expensive one.", "NTA - You're not responsible for your cousin's jealousy.  You're allowed to do what you see best for your kids.  As a maybe compromise, instead of hosting on Christmas day, where everyone see's what your kids get.  Do it Christmas Eve, kids get an early gift to unwrap and then by the time they all see each other again, they've all forgotten about Christmas gifts.", "NTA.  You are amazing hosting around 30? people every Christmas!  That's a huge undertaking of your time, energy, and finances.   You assumed responsibility for hosting all holidays from your grandmother - time for others to do the same.  Set boundaries (adults can continue with their tantrums) and tell family - that you are going to rotate your hosting responsibilities - INCLUDING CHRISTMAS.  NOT YOUR PROBLEM OR RESPONSIBILITY.  If limited finances, they can host a pot luck.  If limited space, many of us grew up in small apartments and hosted HUGE holidays.\n\nYou are thoughtful, generous with your nieces/nephews.  Some family members feel very entitled to \"your\" money.  YOUR money.  YOUR business.  Other than your parents, stop using precious time & resources to make adult family gifts.  Regarding gifts for the other kids - spend the agreed upon amount.  Gift your children whatever you want.  And don't engage in further talk about what you should do.  Family are ungrateful.\n\nHave your parents over another time - or treat for a nice meal before or after the holidays.  Think about a great family vacation with hubby/kids over next Christmas.  This is only on you if you allow it.", "NTA\n\nIt is so sad that you give generously and it's turned into a referendum on your resources.\n\nThey are flat out jealous of you and should deal with their own feelings of inadequacy rather than laying it on you. \n\nWhat you spend on your children is absolutely none of their business. People have different means in this world, and their children, depending on age, likely understand that. If they don't yet, they will soon, whether at Christmas or in school, or wherever.\n\nWhat a shame that your relatives don't take this as an opportunity to teach their children about gratitude. This world isn't fair, and it's not your job to make it so for everyone.", "NTA - and the cousins need to learn that some kids get more at Christmas than others.\n\nMy kids were always the \"poor cousins\". I was a SAHM and both of dh's sisters were very well off. It astounded me how much their cousins got for Christmas, but I wasn't paying for it so all good.\n\nA couple of times my kids would ask why they didn't get gifts like that. Then I did my job as a mom and explained that not everybody has the same amounts of money, and everyone does the best they can. I pointed out to them that while no, they don't get the same as their cousins but there are children who would look at them and think they were the rich kids because they didn't get anything at all or maybe just one small toy. \n\nIt took them a while to understand but never once did I tell them that they should get the same as their cousins. \n\nNow that my kids are adults, they don't care about gifts at all. They ask for nothing (I have to pry a list out of them and then they tell me one small item) and are super appreciative of anything they get. Their cousins? Not so much. \n\nIt's time to tell your cousins that it's their responsibility to provide for their kids and your responsibility to provide for yours. It's not a competition and they need to sit down with their kids and explain that to them.", "NTA - Cousings are attempting to get you to confuse generosity with obligation.  You have no obligation to care about the nonnecessity needs, gift around/for, or take on the material dreams for the care of other people's children.\n  \nThis happens with all families who have one or two parts of the family that live in a different social class than the remainder of the family.  \n  \nFrankly, if it was me, I'd go down to the mall and pick up a few of those angel tree charity tags that almost always ask for things like clothes and food and small toys and make each of the cousins' children the charitable donors as you fill those needs.\n  \nYou then wrap those tags and the reciepts for what you bought for those kids on the cousins' behalf and they can read all about how they helped people in real need get basic necessities for Christmas and wish they had that $35 gift they normally get.\n  \nIt will, of course, piss everyone off, but that might be the present you truly wanted this year and just didn't know it.", "Ahhhhh, \u2018it\u2019s the season to commercialize and stress over the birth of Jesus celebration.\n\nMight be time to make changes to the gift exchange. Have the kids and adults draw names. Set a price limit that is affordable to everyone.  When it\u2019s time to open gifts take turns. We usually draw names at Thanksgiving. If someone can\u2019t be there for the name drawing, Grandma draws for the absent family members. Of course if you draw your own name you put that slip back into the hat and draw again.", "NTA but just in case, I would just make sure your kids aren't going overboard in rubbing their expensive gifts in their cousins' faces.", "NTA\\_ Those are not your kids and you are allowed to spoil your kids especially during Christmas. It is their job to provide for their family. You already buy them a gift. I would continue to do what you are doing.", "NTA! It's not their business what you buy for your own kids.  They are jealous,  simple as.", "Nta  these are your kids", "NTA. That other chunk of your family is acting super entitled.", "NTA. Your family is not entitled to your money. You buy stuff for your kids and they open by themselves on Christmas when their cousins are not there. They aren\u2019t flaunting it flaunting it would be opening it in front of them and laughing about it.", "So if the cousins are upset, tell them that since things seem to have gotten out of hand and that there are upset feelings, in the interest of family peace, you are no longer buying presents for anyone outside your immediate family. If they wish to continue the tradition of giving all the kids presents, then they can step up and do it. \n\nI agree with other posters that y'all start rotating hosting Christmas starting next year. If they complain and cry poor - make it a potluck. Those are a lot more fun anyway.", "Hmm difficult.. \nOn the one hand you\u2019re already very generous and in no way obliged to buy cousins expensive presents. \n\nHowever.. I can understand that it gives the cousins a hard time if your kids get way cooler presents. \nAnd I do think it\u2019s fine for children to be grateful for smaller gifts. \n\nOr maybe you can give them their bigger presents when the family goes back home? (I\u2019m european and have no clue how long family normally stays around the holidays)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tbh, it's probably a bit of resentment and jealousy that has built up over time but has blown up due to the current economic reality. Cost of living is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nYour good fortune in being able to afford better for your children is not cause for them to demand you pay for things. If the shoe were on the other foot, they would feel the same as you do.\n\nUnfortunately there's no easy resolution except to ask your kids not to talk about their gifts. It's silly because they're kids and also the cousins will notice new things too.\n\nBest advice here is to bump up home security and watch your items when having people over.

Whether it's family or friends at school. Children who are raised to value what their family can afford and appreciate it don't care that the other kids might get more things or pricey things. You can't dictate what you do because others are spending less. I had a rich cousin growing up who got all the latest tech and even a BMW for his 15th (yes a year before he could drive) birthday. I never questioned why he got more than my brothers and I. We were raised by a single dad and I was grateful for the things he could get us.

I personally don't do too much for my little one on holidays because she gets gifts randomly throughout the year. I value more of spending time together and have a family gathering.
