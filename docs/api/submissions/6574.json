Due to a really bad car crash, while on the phone with me. \n\n I\u2019ve put on my face for the sake of my children but I haven\u2019t come close to content or closure with his death. It still very much taunts me and it\u2019s still just as painful as before. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, my kids are in therapy, everyone\u2019s getting help.

It felt like she wanted me to just forget about it, move on, she made all these comments about dating again, moving out of the house (my husband built that house) selling it to someone, throwing away all of his stuff. \n\nI almost cut contact with her when I found out she had tried to take my wedding ring while I had it off, all of this was a month after his death. As I said, maybe it is unhealthy of me, I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve never been through this big of a loss, so idk what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, but I do know that I want to mourn and heal at my own pace.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been distant with her, however she has a wedding with her fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s a very fast wedding they planned it in 5 months, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me where it was located, all she said was \u201cnear here\u201d and she\u2019d send me the address day of, I tried pushing for the answer because I feel like that was weird, but she didn\u2019t budge and I was in no place to fight with her over this. \n\nThis was two days ago, The day of she sent me the address of the place, and I recognized it immediately, it was the place me and my husband got married to. I guess this is why she didn\u2019t want to tell me. \n\nThis was the day before the anniversary of his death, I didn\u2019t think me or my kids could handle being there, I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all of that, with the day and the memories I didn\u2019t have that strength to do that. \n\nI sent her a message, I told her that I won\u2019t be coming, I will drop off my gift, we can plan something later, I sent my best wishes and congrats. \n\nI had so many messages calling me selfish, an asshole, a bitch for doing this, deceiving, unhealthy, dramatic, you name it she said it,  She said that I was awful for not attending, dramatic and I need to get over myself because it had nothing to do with him. \n\nBut I said that she knew this would happen that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me, she tried to force me into this, and that\u2019s not fair to me, I said that I hope she has a great wedding and I didn\u2019t respond to any other messages.

Surround yourself with people that actually care about your mental health, your kids, and you, that love you and support you. Let those become your new family. As someone that had to cut out my own (abusive) family, it sounds cheesy, but \"friends are the family that we choose\" became a lifeline for me; I had to realize that just because I was born into a relationship didn't mean they were good or healthy for me.\n\nGood luck and hugs from an internet stranger.", "Jesus, NTA.

You are a better person than I am.  I would have shelved that message and pretended I didnt get it til after the fact and not answered the phone,  The day of????   She obviously wanted the drama which you really, really dont need.  Just keep sending you best wishes and ignore everything else and request that she refrain from giving you advice about your grieving process, therapeutic  advice (same for any familial opinions).  Here is hoping you have more supportive friends and sorrow for your loss.", "NTA. \n\n>selfish, an asshole, a bitch for doing this, deceiving, unhealthy, dramatic\n\nShe described herself. She knew this would be a problem, which is why she wouldn't tell you where it was going to be.\n\nHer previous behaviour was also awful. She clearly can't begin to understand anything at all about what you have been going through.", "NTA. Your sister clearly knew this was going to be a sensitive thing for you. I know you don\u2019t have \u2018forever rights\u2019 to that venue but the mere fact that she booked it post your husbands passing and kept it from you clearly shows her intention. And what with trying to steal your wedding ring??? I\u2019m not saying you should have given your ok if she had been an adult and discussed booking the same venue but it would have shown come caring and compassion from her. I\u2019m sorry for you and your children loss and how you\u2019re being treated by your family.

I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA but your sister is!  And she\u2019s an unfeeling B.", "NTA\n\nOP, I am so sorry for your and your children loss. Grief isn't something to get over. It takes time. What you are doing is perfectly normal and healthy. No one dictates how long you grieve; personally, I think grief never goes away, it becomes less and manageable. \n\nYour sister is such an AH. What she has done to your family is cruel. Trying to push you to move, take your ring, and take your memories away?! Absolutely not. If anyone close to me did this, they'd be gone from my life. It's your decision what to do with your sister, but please know what she has done is not right.", "nta\nall the love for you \nsuch a huge loss \nyou will navigate it in your way with help from your therapist", "Nope. You are NTA in any shape or form, but anyone, including close family, selfish enough to put that kind of pressure on you for their own comfort is is a complete AH. I say for their own comfort, because another\u2019s mourning can be uncomfortable, but when we love the bereft person we absorb that, and give them the support they need, without conditions, without limits, and without judgement. These cliches about everyone coping with loss differently, time being needed, and the pain never going, but easing, are cliches for good reason. You take your time, care for your kids, and accept support from those who love you deeply, because she\u2019s being a dick, and shouldn\u2019t be pandered to.", "**NTA** \n\nYour sister is a Grade A AH. She tried to take your ring? That\u2019s totally wrong, and theft.  The rest is incredibly insensitive.  It doesn\u2019t sound like being around her is good for your mental health.  Maybe she\u2019s convinced herself that she\u2019s trying to help you, she\u2019s hurting you.  She should be supporting you.  Instead of making you attend the wedding at the same place, she should have been asking you how to make it easier for you to attend.  At the very least, she should have asked your blessing to have the wedding there, instead, she hid it from you. \n\nI am so sorry.", "Your sister is vicious and unhinged. Having her wedding at the place you got married, the day before the anniversary of his death? I\u2019d bet she either couldn\u2019t get the day of, or she misremembered it by a day. What she\u2019s done is calculated and it\u2019s evil. Evil. God help her spouse when they realise what they\u2019re marrying. Continue your healing and cut her off.

She is sick or evil or both.", "NTA. You sister is a horrid garbage person that you don\u2019t need your life. Cut contact with her completely and permanently", "This is heartbreaking to read. I\u2019m so sorry that your family has not been supportive at this tough time. Your sister is particularly cruel and time apart would be ideal.

If not keep life focused on your kids, your therapy, your memories and your future.", "NTA she should\u2019ve told you where it was asap so you could either work through your feelings about it and be there or outright say no she didn\u2019t and you don\u2019t have to be accepting of her intentionally deceiving you because you\u2019re supposed to \u201cget over it\u201d", "For the love of God. A year?  Hello no you shouldn\u2019t be 100% okay by now. What a trauma. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say about your sister. It sounds like the terrible realities of your life have interfered with her life plan and that\u2019s annoying to her. I\u2019m sorry for her lack of empathy. \n\nGood for you getting you and yours therapy. Keep going, girl. It\u2019ll never be the same but it\u2019ll get better. \n\nNTA", "I'll probably get blasted, but this is possibly NAH. \n\nIs the place where you got married and your sister is getting married significant to your family?  In other words, is it the church you grew up in or both went to?  If so, then it's meaningful to her too.\n\nI know when I've had friends lose significant others, we've also tried to help them cope with the lose.  Some people do need help focusing on what they still have and the people who are still around who care about them.  Some people need that and appreciate it and others need to grieve for much longer and in their own way.\n\nYou have made it clear you are still dealing with it, but don't lose the people who are still alive and care about you.

We went there for mini-breaks as often as we could and had hoped to organise a second home there.   \n\n\nAnother friend wants me to sell my house and move closer to her.   \n\n\nIf they keep nagging, I'll be cutting contact.", "Your family is wrong.   What you describe is both right and common and not weird in any way.   Your therapist is absolutely correct.   \n\nThere are many ways to live with grief.
