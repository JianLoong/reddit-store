Due to a really bad car crash, while on the phone with me. \n\n I\u2019ve put on my face for the sake of my children but I haven\u2019t come close to content or closure with his death. It still very much taunts me and it\u2019s still just as painful as before. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, my kids are in therapy, everyone\u2019s getting help. But it\u2019s still just as traumatizing, maybe it\u2019s an issue that I haven\u2019t gotten over it yet, maybe it\u2019s not normal to act the way I do towards this, but wether I do or don\u2019t, it\u2019s my issue to worry about. \n\nMy sister and I used to be very close however after my husband passed I was distant, in her eyes I was just pushing everyone away but in mine she was insensitive to my situation.   It felt like she wanted me to just forget about it, move on, she made all these comments about dating again, moving out of the house (my husband built that house) selling it to someone, throwing away all of his stuff. \n\nI almost cut contact with her when I found out she had tried to take my wedding ring while I had it off, all of this was a month after his death. As I said, maybe it is unhealthy of me, I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve never been through this big of a loss, so idk what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, but I do know that I want to mourn and heal at my own pace.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been distant with her, however she has a wedding with her fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s a very fast wedding they planned it in 5 months, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me where it was located, all she said was \u201cnear here\u201d and she\u2019d send me the address day of, I tried pushing for the answer because I feel like that was weird, but she didn\u2019t budge and I was in no place to fight with her over this. \n\nThis was two days ago, The day of she sent me the address of the place, and I recognized it immediately, it was the place me and my husband got married to. I guess this is why she didn\u2019t want to tell me. \n\nThis was the day before the anniversary of his death, I didn\u2019t think me or my kids could handle being there, I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all of that, with the day and the memories I didn\u2019t have that strength to do that. \n\nI sent her a message, I told her that I won\u2019t be coming, I will drop off my gift, we can plan something later, I sent my best wishes and congrats. \n\nI had so many messages calling me selfish, an asshole, a bitch for doing this, deceiving, unhealthy, dramatic, you name it she said it,  She said that I was awful for not attending, dramatic and I need to get over myself because it had nothing to do with him. \n\nBut I said that she knew this would happen that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me, she tried to force me into this, and that\u2019s not fair to me, I said that I hope she has a great wedding and I didn\u2019t respond to any other messages.

Surround yourself with people that actually care about your mental health, your kids, and you, that love you and support you. Let those become your new family. As someone that had to cut out my own (abusive) family, it sounds cheesy, but \"friends are the family that we choose\" became a lifeline for me; I had to realize that just because I was born into a relationship didn't mean they were good or healthy for me.\n\nGood luck and hugs from an internet stranger.", "Jesus, NTA. Your sister is...well she has some serious issues. You have done NOTHING wrong, I'm so sorry for your loss, I can't even fathom how you're feeling lovely. \n\nTo put it bluntly, she's an arsehole.
