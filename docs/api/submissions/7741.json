It's something I enjoy doing in my free time and makes me feel good to make the people I love a meal to enjoy. My fianc\u00e9e and I recently go engaged and just had our engagement party last weekend that consisted of about just under 30 people. We hosted it at our house. \n\nI knew right away that I wanted to cater my engagement party and make the food for my guests myself. \n\nMy MIL and I have an ok relationship, but she's one of those women who thinks that everything she makes is the absolute best and anyone else's efforts are shit. Her foods pretty good, but it's nothing compared to my mom or my grandma's cooking I had growing up, but obviously I keep my mouth shut about that. Every time we've had a family dinner at her house and I offer to bring something or even help her out in the kitchen she refuses and makes up excuses like \"it won't be done properly\" or \"it won't be as good as mine\".\n\nSo when she found out about my engagement party she asked if she could bring some dishes. I politely declined and said that I will be catering the food  myself. She got offended that I declined and started saying how she should make the food because my husbands side of the family LOVES her food and nothing will compare to hers. \n\nMy husband told her to let it go, that it was our engagement party and my cooking is amazing so everyone is sure to love it.\n\nNight of the engagement party rolls around and I had spent hours in the kitchen making a bunch of dishes that I made sure were perfect. My family and friends LOVED the food and could not stop complimenting me on it. My fianc\u00e9e side of the family were impressed too but my MIL and SIL weren't having it. Every dish my MIL tried she had something negative to say, \"oh my this is too overcooked\", \"the sauce doesn't taste right in this\", \"see this is why I should've made the food\" etc. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I both heard these comments and he pulled her aside to confront her saying if she didn't like the food that she could leave, tonight is about us not her. \n\nShe started going off about how it was so disrespectful of me to decline her offer when she is obviously a better cook and these dishes weren't made properly and how she feels bad for the guests.\n\nI was just over it at this point and told her to 1) get her head out of her ass and 2) to leave the party because I am not going to be disrespected in my own house. \n\nMIL, FIL and SIL ended up leaving and have been messaging my fianc\u00e9e non stop about how I was so disrespectful and need to apologize for taking it too far and insulting her. They even suggested he rethink his decision to marry me?! Fianc\u00e9e told them that she needs to apologize to me first.\n\nBoth my mom and grandma think that it wouldn't have been the end of the world if I let her bring a dish or two.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674141016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g42f9/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_cater_my_engagement/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 is standing strong beside you.", "NTA who goes to someone's party and insults the host's food?  She's just rude and you have an excuse to never invite her over again \"Oh, you wouldn't like the food so don't bother coming for Christmas\". However you handle it, you shouldn't put yourself in the position of this bullshit again. \n\nI was going to say you should have let her bring a dessert or something to contribute but obviously that would not have been enough for this woman. Good luck. I'm glad you're fiancee is on your side, you're going to need it.", "NTA. Why should you let her bring anything to your event when she always rejects your offer to bring something to hers? \"Be the bigger person\" cuts both ways, & your MIL needs to learn that.", "NTA...Your fianc\u00e9 summed it up nicely when he said the night was about you, not them. It's good that you are setting the boundaries now.  They can learn to behave or not be as involved in your life.", "Nta shout out to your fianc\u00e9 for being on your side sounds like you have a keeper congrats. Anyway yea she\u2019s out of line with the comments and she\u2019s the one that needs to apologize", "NTA You were attacked and you pushed back. But here's the thing. You need to make sure that your fiance will ALWAYS defend you from her narcissism or your marriage will not last long because she will be attacking you forever. Are you sure that he is absolutely in your side and not going to be cowed by her?", "NTA. It\u2019s wise to create the boundaries now before you are married into this family. She was very disrespectful and there\u2019s no reason for you to have to tolerate that, especially at a party meant to honor you and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA. Wow, she\u2019s a bully. I also love to cook and if I were in your MIL\u2019s position I could totally see myself sort of pushing you to let me cook instead but it would SO NOT be because I thought the food wouldn\u2019t be good - it would be because I\u2019d think that it was going to be stressful for you to be cooking for 30 people at your own engagement party and that you should have as little to worry about as possible because you are the star today. But she wasn\u2019t at all asking to do you a favor - it\u2019s like she can\u2019t stand for one day someone not praising her for something and is using her food as a way to get self esteem and attention. It\u2019s unbelievably fucked that she insulted your cooking at your engagement party and told you it wasn\u2019t prepared properly. Even if the food had been horrible there\u2019s no excuse for what she did - and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was.", "NTA\n\nIt's time she was put in her place and I'm so glad you and your fianc\u00e9 are a united front against her crap. \n\nI will say that it never hurts to compromise though, and probably wouldn't have hurt to give her one dish to make. Then you could have sat back while everyone raved about your food and were so-so about hers.", "NTA, setting and enforcing boundaries is important", "NTA. Its the end of the fucking world if she doesn't cook, so I am 100% behind you in dying on the hill that she doesn't bring food to your house ever. Fuck no. I wouldn't apologize. They went too far by not politely eating and moving on, but to insult your cooking in front of you at your home, then question whether you should be marrying their son when you won't ignore their insults? Thank goodness you have your fiance's support, if not, that would be a deal-breaker.", "NTA I could say why not let her bring a dish or two, BUT they would have been THE best, greatest, most beautiful dishes of all time. So NO. I will also say, be prepared for this MIL, SIL and FIL( because he just can\u2019t fight it) to be this way the entirety of your marriage.", "NTA and you were right not letting her bring one or two dishes. You know she would\u2019ve made it a competition since both sides of the family were there, and it would have been really embarrassing in front of the guests.", "NTA\n\nShe was the one insulting you. You just refused to take it.", "NTA, my mil is like this. I am pretty non confrontational so I let her be the star on Thanksgiving. I usually try to convince her to at least let me bring dessert, sometimes I'll get to make it if we are the ones hosting, but she's so scared another person will get a compliment on their food she will actually go buy a pie instead. And I don't mean one from a decent bakery or on of those yummy Sarah Lee frozen desserts. She'll buy some crusty pie at the grocery store that was half off.  It's honestly insulting. This year I got a little justice because I mentioned about making a cake, she said she'd rather just buy a pie. So I didn't make it. The pie was so bad she even asked me during dessert - weren't you bringing a cake..?   \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - sounds like your MIL doesn\u2019t like not having the control over her family. Kudos to you for standing your ground and also kudos to your husband for having your back. \nOne quick note about her toxicity surrounding her food being \u201cbetter\u201d than yours\u2026 try not to get caught up in that war. You sound like you\u2019re already comparing and think your food is better. To keep the peace in future (assuming all of this gets sorted) I would attempt to embrace and enjoy the food at her house and continue to make your food at your house/events. Don\u2019t get caught up in her competition because it\u2019ll only harm your mental health and I would think eventually put stress in your relationship with your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA \n\nPersonally, I would have chosen different words to say to her and kicking her out probably should have been a combined effort of you and your fianc\u00e9 but I can totally understand what led up to everything. \n\nBoundaries have hopefully been set and as long as you two present a united front, that's the main thing. You both have to stand your ground or her behavior will only continue. In her small mind, you'll never be good enough for her son and that's something SHE needs to resolve herself.", "NTA.  Don't get caught up in a debate about who caters your wedding reception. \n\nBut I do agree with your mom and Nan. Compromise works wonders in these sorts of situations.", "NTA. Good luck with your MIL moving forward, seems like that relationship will be tough.", "NTA and wow, your MIL sound awful! She clearly overstepped and your fiance thankfully recognizes it.", "Your engagement party is about sharing your and your fiance's joy with loved ones. Cooking for your loved ones brings you joy. You chose to combine the two for your happiness. NTA.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t bring food to your house there\u2019s no good reason for her to bring anything to your house. If you give her an inch she\u2019ll take a mile. And good on your fianc\u00e9 for having your back.", "NTA - \n\nYour mom is right, letting MIL bring a dish wouldn't have hurt anything & possibly would have been helpful. But your MIL seems insufferable regarding the food. & once the insults started flying I'm glad your STBH stepped up for you. \n\nBoundaries are great - she insults your cooking in your own home, she's gotta go. Next time let your fiance handle it 100%. His momster, his problem. You thank him well for having your back afterwards. This is something you have to chat with him about ahead of time, so he knows what the expectations are. You are going to be gracious & kind, he's gonna be the heavy. No-one will have any room to say the issue is with you. & don't forget, if the tables are ever turned, you have to stick up for him. \n\nCongrats on the engagement.", "The MIL is obviously in the wrong here because being a good cook does not mean that you become entitled to insult anyone elses food that YOU think is not up to your level. Your MIL is no Gordon Ramsay and really needs to humble herself. But your mother and grandmother were right, you knew your MIL would not tolerate this (given her past behavior) so it really would not have been the end of the world if you let her bring a dish or two. But i still understand where you are coming from because if i had been in a similar situation i honestly might have done the same, so i would not blame you for it, so NTA.", "NTA\n\n1. You should have let her bring a dish or two. It would have hurt no one and might have created goodwill. I would normally say E S H because of this except:\n\n\n2. Holy God, your mother in law is inappropriate! I get that she may be feeling marginalized and threatened by you. She may sincerely have different tastes than you. For all we know, you are delusional and she's a way better cook but that wouldn't matter! It was your event, and she's incredibly rude.", "NTA for preparing the food for the party. NTA for declining her offer to prepare food for the party. YTA for responding to her rudeness with rudeness of your own.  This was your engagement party. Everyone, sans her and her daughter, were enjoying your food. Everyone, sans her and her daughter, was enjoying themselves. Future MIL looked petty. She looked like an asshole to your guests. You should have left it at that. You both look assholish now. To add, MILs tend to have long memories when they feel that they have been publicly humiliated. You asked her to leave your engagement party. Your fiancee's parents and sister left. MIL and SIL  will hold on to this. Causing long term issues.

Someone like this is the kind of person who would try to cause as much trouble as possible. Making the same dishes as Op or even bringing an entire meal and then complaining until OP\u2019s food is put away. Think of this without the extra noise - you are throwing a dinner party and a guest starts insisting that they provide the food because they are a better cook than you and the other guests won\u2019t want to eat what you make. Do you just roll over and go \u201coh sure, please save everyone from my bad cooking?\u201d Or do you think it\u2019s unspeakably rude and hold firm?", "> it really would not have been the end of the world if you let her bring a dish or two\n\nYeah, except, MIL would have probably turned up with far more dishes. She would have reasoned that \"It didn't seem fair to your guests if I only turned up with one or two dishes. This way, everyone gets to enjoy my cooking.\" Then she would have insisted that every dish went on the table, even if it meant that there was no space for any of OP's food.\n\nIf there was room for OP's food, MIL would have spent the evening telling people that they don't really want OP's food and that they should have hers because she made it and it's better. Then the rest of the night would have been spent fishing for compliments about how super amazing awesome her food was, and how much nicer it was that OP's.\n\nYou can't compromise with narcissists. They don't know how to.", "Yeah I dont understand why giving her 1 or 2 dishes to bring would have been the biggest deal.  Mil is clearly wrong but I feel like op dug her heels in to start a never ending battle before she's even married. I agree esh. This doesn't bode well for the future.  I'm all about boundaries but just saying oh make this one dish I like that you make can you make that?  Even if it's not 100% accurate it will make for a brighter future for everyone and wouldn't have come to this head.", "I mean, what's worse manners than insulting your soon-to-be DIL's food at the engagement party!?", "I could've maybe let her bring a dish but I feel like it's just the principle of it.

She would have \u201csaved\u201d your guests from starvation.", "I do agree with your comment as such egoistic people are impossible to please and the MIL would have stopped at nothing to eventually cause a scene. But for the sake of OP, she could have allowed the MIL to bring one or two side dishes that would have allowed OP the peace of knowing that she at least tried to not make the MIL mad. Now she is doubting whether she is the AH or not. Allowing the MIL to bring a dish and then her causing a scene would have saved OP from this doubt.", "I agree with you.

Just because she's an incredibly rude and controlling woman doesn't mean you take the low ground back. I get it. You are legitimately resentful and don't like her, so you took the opportunity to serve her some of the treatment she had shown you.", "OP and MIL sound exactly the same.  Both disparage each other\u2019s cooking. Both toot their own horns about how good their own cooking is. \n\nBTW - every time I am invited to someone house for dinner, I compliment their food.  Regardless of what I really think of it. \n\nIf OP\u2019s guests weren\u2019t asking for her recipes, they were only being polite when complimenting her cooking.", "Lol fr", "Agreed.
