It's something I enjoy doing in my free time and makes me feel good to make the people I love a meal to enjoy. My fianc\u00e9e and I recently go engaged and just had our engagement party last weekend that consisted of about just under 30 people. We hosted it at our house. \n\nI knew right away that I wanted to cater my engagement party and make the food for my guests myself. \n\nMy MIL and I have an ok relationship, but she's one of those women who thinks that everything she makes is the absolute best and anyone else's efforts are shit. Her foods pretty good, but it's nothing compared to my mom or my grandma's cooking I had growing up, but obviously I keep my mouth shut about that. Every time we've had a family dinner at her house and I offer to bring something or even help her out in the kitchen she refuses and makes up excuses like \"it won't be done properly\" or \"it won't be as good as mine\".\n\nSo when she found out about my engagement party she asked if she could bring some dishes. I politely declined and said that I will be catering the food  myself. She got offended that I declined and started saying how she should make the food because my husbands side of the family LOVES her food and nothing will compare to hers. \n\nMy husband told her to let it go, that it was our engagement party and my cooking is amazing so everyone is sure to love it.\n\nNight of the engagement party rolls around and I had spent hours in the kitchen making a bunch of dishes that I made sure were perfect. My family and friends LOVED the food and could not stop complimenting me on it. My fianc\u00e9e side of the family were impressed too but my MIL and SIL weren't having it. Every dish my MIL tried she had something negative to say, \"oh my this is too overcooked\", \"the sauce doesn't taste right in this\", \"see this is why I should've made the food\" etc. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I both heard these comments and he pulled her aside to confront her saying if she didn't like the food that she could leave, tonight is about us not her. \n\nShe started going off about how it was so disrespectful of me to decline her offer when she is obviously a better cook and these dishes weren't made properly and how she feels bad for the guests.\n\nI was just over it at this point and told her to 1) get her head out of her ass and 2) to leave the party because I am not going to be disrespected in my own house. \n\nMIL, FIL and SIL ended up leaving and have been messaging my fianc\u00e9e non stop about how I was so disrespectful and need to apologize for taking it too far and insulting her. They even suggested he rethink his decision to marry me?! Fianc\u00e9e told them that she needs to apologize to me first.\n\nBoth my mom and grandma think that it wouldn't have been the end of the world if I let her bring a dish or two.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674141016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g42f9/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_cater_my_engagement/", "score": 661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck. I'm glad you're fiancee is on your side, you're going to need it.", "NTA. Why should you let her bring anything to your event when she always rejects your offer to bring something to hers? \"Be the bigger person\" cuts both ways, & your MIL needs to learn that.", "NTA...Your fianc\u00e9 summed it up nicely when he said the night was about you, not them. It's good that you are setting the boundaries now.  They can learn to behave or not be as involved in your life.", "Nta shout out to your fianc\u00e9 for being on your side sounds like you have a keeper congrats. Anyway yea she\u2019s out of line with the comments and she\u2019s the one that needs to apologize", "NTA You were attacked and you pushed back. But here's the thing. You need to make sure that your fiance will ALWAYS defend you from her narcissism or your marriage will not last long because she will be attacking you forever. Are you sure that he is absolutely in your side and not going to be cowed by her?", "NTA. It\u2019s wise to create the boundaries now before you are married into this family. She was very disrespectful and there\u2019s no reason for you to have to tolerate that, especially at a party meant to honor you and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA. Wow, she\u2019s a bully. I also love to cook and if I were in your MIL\u2019s position I could totally see myself sort of pushing you to let me cook instead but it would SO NOT be because I thought the food wouldn\u2019t be good - it would be because I\u2019d think that it was going to be stressful for you to be cooking for 30 people at your own engagement party and that you should have as little to worry about as possible because you are the star today. But she wasn\u2019t at all asking to do you a favor - it\u2019s like she can\u2019t stand for one day someone not praising her for something and is using her food as a way to get self esteem and attention. It\u2019s unbelievably fucked that she insulted your cooking at your engagement party and told you it wasn\u2019t prepared properly.

Its the end of the fucking world if she doesn't cook, so I am 100% behind you in dying on the hill that she doesn't bring food to your house ever. Fuck no. I wouldn't apologize. They went too far by not politely eating and moving on, but to insult your cooking in front of you at your home, then question whether you should be marrying their son when you won't ignore their insults? Thank goodness you have your fiance's support, if not, that would be a deal-breaker.", "NTA I could say why not let her bring a dish or two, BUT they would have been THE best, greatest, most beautiful dishes of all time.

You just refused to take it.", "NTA, my mil is like this. I am pretty non confrontational so I let her be the star on Thanksgiving. I usually try to convince her to at least let me bring dessert, sometimes I'll get to make it if we are the ones hosting, but she's so scared another person will get a compliment on their food she will actually go buy a pie instead. And I don't mean one from a decent bakery or on of those yummy Sarah Lee frozen desserts. She'll buy some crusty pie at the grocery store that was half off.  It's honestly insulting. This year I got a little justice because I mentioned about making a cake, she said she'd rather just buy a pie. So I didn't make it.

You sound like you\u2019re already comparing and think your food is better. To keep the peace in future (assuming all of this gets sorted) I would attempt to embrace and enjoy the food at her house and continue to make your food at your house/events.

You both have to stand your ground or her behavior will only continue. In her small mind, you'll never be good enough for her son and that's something SHE needs to resolve herself.", "NTA.  Don't get caught up in a debate about who caters your wedding reception. \n\nBut I do agree with your mom and Nan. Compromise works wonders in these sorts of situations.", "NTA.

But your MIL seems insufferable regarding the food. & once the insults started flying I'm glad your STBH stepped up for you. \n\nBoundaries are great - she insults your cooking in your own home, she's gotta go. Next time let your fiance handle it 100%. His momster, his problem. You thank him well for having your back afterwards. This is something you have to chat with him about ahead of time, so he knows what the expectations are. You are going to be gracious & kind, he's gonna be the heavy.

Your MIL is no Gordon Ramsay and really needs to humble herself.

Everyone, sans her and her daughter, were enjoying your food. Everyone, sans her and her daughter, was enjoying themselves. Future MIL looked petty. She looked like an asshole to your guests. You should have left it at that. You both look assholish now. To add, MILs tend to have long memories when they feel that they have been publicly humiliated.

Someone like this is the kind of person who would try to cause as much trouble as possible. Making the same dishes as Op or even bringing an entire meal and then complaining until OP\u2019s food is put away. Think of this without the extra noise - you are throwing a dinner party and a guest starts insisting that they provide the food because they are a better cook than you and the other guests won\u2019t want to eat what you make. Do you just roll over and go \u201coh sure, please save everyone from my bad cooking?\u201d Or do you think it\u2019s unspeakably rude and hold firm?", "> it really would not have been the end of the world if you let her bring a dish or two\n\nYeah, except, MIL would have probably turned up with far more dishes. She would have reasoned that \"It didn't seem fair to your guests if I only turned up with one or two dishes. This way, everyone gets to enjoy my cooking.\" Then she would have insisted that every dish went on the table, even if it meant that there was no space for any of OP's food.\n\nIf there was room for OP's food, MIL would have spent the evening telling people that they don't really want OP's food and that they should have hers because she made it and it's better.

I'm all about boundaries but just saying oh make this one dish I like that you make can you make that?

But for the sake of OP, she could have allowed the MIL to bring one or two side dishes that would have allowed OP the peace of knowing that she at least tried to not make the MIL mad.

You are legitimately resentful and don't like her, so you took the opportunity to serve her some of the treatment she had shown you.", "OP and MIL sound exactly the same.  Both disparage each other\u2019s cooking. Both toot their own horns about how good their own cooking is. \n\nBTW - every time I am invited to someone house for dinner, I compliment their food.  Regardless of what I really think of it. \n\nIf OP\u2019s guests weren\u2019t asking for her recipes, they were only being polite when complimenting her cooking.", "Lol fr", "Agreed. Sounds like OP's husband married someone just like his mom, big surprise", " NTA, but it sounds like your MIL is very proud of her ability to cook and you being a good cook makes her feel insecure.

I don\u2019t know, just a thought.", "NTA, and any betting if you had agreed to her bringing a couple of dishes she would have catered enough for everyone there and gotten rid of what you had made to make room for her food (maybe I'm cynical but it comes from meeting people like that...).", "NTA. Be prepared for this woman to interfere in your marriage as often as she can get away with it.", "Nta this was a special night for you and your fiance.

Suggest a cook-off, with blind tasting, and whoever loses has to STFU about the other\u2019s cooking. Sounds like you\u2019d probably win", "NTA, id have let her bring something and then conducted a poll to see which one was better. And then when I won, I would have rubbed it in her face.", "NTA - Best to set boundaries now. What\u2019s going to happen if/when you have children and she decides that her way of raising children is better than yours? Will you have to follow her parenting advice too?", "NTA - my MIL was like that too - not just with food but everything. Little passive aggressive remarks all the time. For the most part I just ignored it when I had to be around her but I went VERY LC with her.", "NTA. But next time, let her bring a dish and send her home with the leftovers from her offering. I once ignored someone that kept making comments about my cooking, then they brought the same dish they knew I was making to a family party. \nPeople were complaining when mine was gone and theirs was all that was left, and the people still wouldn't eat it!!", "NTA. Just another awful MIL who\u2019s choosing to alienate her child and significant other over her stupid pride.  Hopefully her food is good enough to give her comfort when she is NC with son and future grandkids.", "NTA, but not why you think. \n\nYou absolutely could have 'let her bring a dish' and been more potluck. Maybe a dessert to minimize. It's slightly unreasonable to not let your partner's mom be involved. Alternatives of plates, helping do dishes, decorating, gift bags, etc is a reasonable alternative. But your gut told the truth, no compromise would have worked. \n\nThis never was about the dish to FMIL. It was about control. You and your partner handled it perfectly. She was encouraged to politely leave. Now she is left with dampening your party but not ruining and others saw how you handled it, discreetly. Your Fianc\u00e9e had your back. FMIL has nothing to control left. \n\nMy only advice is don't take your foot off the gas. Don't accelerate. Be consistent about boundaries. She will try to overstep and it is very easy to go from 'reasonable boundaries' to 'punishing FMIL' and becoming the bad guy.", "NTA!\n\nI also think you need r/JUSTNOMIL or at the very least r/Mildlynomil She sounds exhausting.....", "Maybe you should rethink marrying into that family..  I wouldn't apologize, because the party wasn't about her, it was about y'all.  Good Luck", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds like a nightmare. It's awfully impolite to insult someone's cooking right in front of them. The fact that everyone else agrees on you being an excellent cook just makes it sound all the more like your MIL is a very controlling and unpleasant person.", "NTA\n\nAt this moment I would be thinking if I wanted that part of his family in my wedding at all... the disrespect", "NTA \nIt's called boundaries.", "NTA whatsoever, cut contact atp however you\u2019re better than me, i would\u2019ve let her bring one dish to have no one touch it but them", "NTA. Sometimes it really feels like some people were brought up in an isolated cave or something. I prefer the food I make but during holidays and other events I eat what is served and keep my mouth shut if it's bland or overcooked. Honestly, your SIL and MIL lack basic manners and I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA", "NTA, also, don\u2019t ask the SIL to be a Bridesmaid.

Good on your SO for having your back though!", "NTA-Take it from someone who knows first hand. If you give the MIL and inch, she\u2019ll take 1,000 miles. Best to stop this in its tracks before it gets out of hand in the marriage.

Then, when she offers, you say \"The food for this meal is type X, I need this type of dish, I know it isn't familiar to you, so I'll send a recipe.\"  \n\nSo, if, say, she normally cooks Italian, make an Indian feast, and send her a recipe for a lamb curry.\n\nIf she's such a good cook, she can follow the recipe, do the research to understand anything unfamiliar and get ingredients, and do a practice run if needed.\n\nAnd if she just shows up with her normal spaghetti and meatballs, she'll show her own limits, and look the fool.", "NTA, but let\u2019s be very honest, could she ever be ok with bringing one or two dishes? If so, then yeah, you could have let her. I\u2019d she wanted to cook everything, then obs not. I\u2019m of the opinion that you should be doing less work for something everyone is celebrating in your honour.", "Yeah, exactly.

The closest to a \"compromise\" I see in your future is to tell her that you are happy to let her cook in her domain, and you will exclusively cook in yours.

Not hers. \n\nBut bearing in mind that she's going to be your MIL, perhaps it wouldn't have hurt to allow her to bring a few items to this party. So there at least, I agree with your Mother and Grandmother.\n\nIt was pretty petty of her to criticize everything you made during this party, and outright RUDE, but this seems to be the kind of person she usually is, from what you've said. She apparently has difficulty giving praise to someone else's efforts, and feels that she has to be the focus of attention by criticizing the efforts of others.\n\nWhat she did at YOUR engagement party is inexcusable. What she, her husband and your fiance's sister are doing in telling your fiance he should rethink his decision in marrying you is outrageous.\n\nI'm glad at least that your fiance stood up for you, and is supportive of you over his mother's disgraceful behavior.\n\nI'm sorry she couldn't manage to suppress her need to be the focus of attention for one single dinner party, and that she's projecting blame on you for her own disgusting behavior.", "There are only a few circumstances where I allow people to bring food to an event at my home when I am cooking:\n\n1.

Your Mum & Grandma have old school manners and probably thought if you humored M-I-L a bit, she'd be okay, but M-I-L isn't on the same level as them. She obviously has NO manners and will never improve as everything (including another person's engagement) is about her. Plus now she's made it apparent she doesn't think you're good enough for her son. Thus, in her eyes you'll never be a good-enough cook, good-enough housekeeper, good-enough wife or good-enough mother (if you go that route). M-I-L was waaaay over the top by insulting your food so others could hear, at your party, in your home, AND engaging her flying monkeys to join in on the host-bashing. I'm glad your fianc\u00e9 is on your side because there will inevitably be more and more issues until you go low/no contact or she miraculously changes (don't hold your breath). Good luck! PS: I have an adult son and I cannot for the life of me understand why any M-I-L acts this way - absolutely no one in my family or friend circle would ever act this way or accept this behaviour from anyone else.

It seems as though your MIL can't stand not being the center of attention.

Don't get involved with food and your future MIL again. \n\nOr, you can now take her behavior as permission to treat her as she treats others. Your mom and grandma are right, it wouldn't have been the end of the world if you'd let her bring a dish or two.

OP is actually on a forum designed for the ones who are in doubt and her question clearly states that she is in doubt.

I was just trying to help OP better understand what could have happened if she did allow MIL to bring a few dishes, which is what she is doubtful about."]}
