I told her I can't leave work because I have an important meeting, and she will have to change it herself. She calls me again, THREE HOURS later, asking if my meeting was over and if I could help now. I asked why she didn't just put on her spare tire, to which she said didn't know how, so instead she went in got food at a cafe nearby and left her car.  I asked why, in two hours, she didn't just GOOGLE how to change a tire? She said her dad has always come and changed her tire for her. I was pretty annoyed and told her I'm not her \"dad\" so she will need to learn how to do these types of things, but ultimately left work to help her change the tire. She also hasn't made any attempt to learn how to change a tire since then.\n2. We recently bought a home and it's the first time either of us have had a yard. We split chores 'evenly' (in reality I end up doing more, on top of all the cooking). I mowed the first week and when the second week rolled around, I pointed out that it was her turn since the grass was getting long, and the next day was one of the few days where it wouldn't be extremely hot. She looked absolutely puzzled because apparently she just assumed I was always going to be the one to mow? She said she didn't know how to start the mower, so I showed her how to start it, adjust the height, add gas etc and she agreed to mow the next day. I came home from work and she hadn't mowed and I asked why. She said she couldn't start the mower. It's a brand new honda mower that's probably the easiest thing to start on earth.  Annoyingly, the mower was in the exact spot from the day before, so I know she didn't even TRY!\n3. Recently we bought new light switches (her request) since the old ones were ugly and cream colored. There were about 16 of them in total that needed swapped out. I told her I would swap out the ones downstairs if she does the ones upstairs. I did mine that day, and she said she'd do hers later. Well, 5 weeks passed, and I asked if she was ever going to swap them out. She told me she couldn't figure it out. Mind you, I'd NEVER done this before either, but I watched a 5 minutes youtube video and just read the instructions and it was pretty easy.\n\nI ask again if she is going to do them, and she says \"I'll probably just leave them as-is since they don't look that bad\". I was furious. SHE was the one who wanted them, I bought them. Because she took so long to do it, they were past the return date, so basically I'm forced to do it. I told her I'm tired of her weaponized incompetence, and she said she's not doing it \"on purpose\" -- so then I told her maybe it's just regular incompetence then. She's still upset at me.

She deserved to be called out.", "NTA. Because she is choosing to be incompetent. She's not unintelligent, she just doesn't care as much as you do, and I think by just \"waiting\" she is effectively ensuring you will do the task.\n\nYou guys need to have a real talk about chores and division of labor. Decide which you will do, which she will do, and what you want to outsource. I don't know how to change a tire (well, theoretically i do, but I've never done it), but I do know how to sign up for AAA roadside service. My husband doesn't mow grass because ... allergies, so sometimes I do it, and sometimes I've just hired out a lawn service. \n\nBeing the One Who Nags is awful, but if she is going to shirk on chores, don't expect that to EVER change. I am married for a long time to someone who STILL needs to be told to clear his dishes and asked to empty the dishwasher. He will NEVER do it on his own!", "I can understand her not wanting to change the tire, especially if it's in a dangerous spot, but dang there's a bunch of options she could have chosen within those three hours. \n\nNTA, but I think you've enabled her to this point. The problem is she doesn't make the effort and knows almost no matter what that you will just do the job for her. \n\nThe red flag is waving right in your face. You are going to be in an extremely unhappy and potentially short marriage if this cannot be resolved.", "NTA and I'd have probably said the same thing in your shoes. Not only is she unwilling to learn, she can't be bothered to keep her word, nor can she be bothered to be honest about what she is or is not willing to do. My guess is that she considered many of the tasks you described as \"man's work\" which is BS but sadly so common amongst people about gendered divisions of labor.\n\nSpeaking from experience I swapped out about 100 switches when my partner and I bought our house and had never done it before. It's not hard. But I did screw up by not realizing that 3 way switches are different than 2 way so that sucked to re-do a bunch of them. But ya know what? I learned! And I'm a woman. Who'd have thunk it?!", "NTA. If you were a woman posting about her boyfriend who refuses to learn to do dishes or sweep the floor, these comments would be applauding you. She's intentionally refusing to learn how to do these chores so YOU end up having to do them.

Nobody wants a life time of this.", "Items 2 and 3 are super annoying. In her defense, I don't change my own tire either unless I'm in the middle of nowhere. This is why I have insurance with roadside assistance. So often it just isn't safe to change it if you're a woman alone. However, this does look like it's part of a larger trend, so I'll say NTA.", "INFO I think a breakdown of what each of you does around the house is required.", "Info : what qualities did u like to make her your partner?", "NTA. I will say though I know all the steps of changing a tire, I keep all the tools and the spare required in my trunk, but I still have to call for help to change them because I\u2019m physically not strong enough. I\u2019ve literally tried jumping on the wrench before to get it to move but I just don\u2019t have the mass. Everything else she could do though so I agree with you.", "Here's the thing...have you tried teaching her?  Instead of leaving it up to her Googling or YouTubing something, show her how it's done.  Ask her what she needs help with.  Some people are seriously worried about F'ing up something (myself included) and having someone to show how to do it (instead of relying on them going out and discovering out) can make all the difference.", "The tyre thing yeah nta but the light switch thing, if neither of you knew why not do it and learn together? Encourage her? She may not be confident with things like this. I'm definitely not and feel much better if my partner and I work through things together. Doing the light switches separately screams weirdness to me - you have a shared house why not share the learning of the new stuff instead of getting angry with her?", "NTA\n\nIt IS weaponized incompetence and this is what you will have for the rest of your lives together.  She has been spoiled and enabled and will expect you do to everything around the house going forward.\n\nTHINK about this relationship.", "YTA for treating your fianc\u00e9e as a roommate. Have some patience with her. Show her how to do things instead of expecting her to look it up on Google. And then help her the first time she has to do it.\n\nAre you not willing to grow with your partner? I'm seriously puzzled as to why you are with her, given the way you speak about her.", "NTA", "First, I need to know what responsibilities your fianc\u00e9e has around the house and in general before I have a definite thought on this.  I've never had to change a tire and so you lost me on that one and also the electrical switches too.  Both these tasks need to be safely and correctly done so I'm not even sure that's a reasonable thing to foist on her.  As for mowing, we ALL can mow and should.  But, first, I need to know what she does contribute to this relationship.", "I don\u2019t think this is weaponised incompetence because these aren\u2019t all common jobs that anyone can feel comfortable doing (lawn mowing is the exception).\nMaybe it\u2019s just me but i know loads of men and women who can\u2019t/don\u2019t change tyres or change their own light switches. There\u2019s a very real danger of doing it wrong.\n\nBut if a man or woman pretends they \u201cdon\u2019t see mess\u201d or can\u2019t do dishes/laundry that\u2019s a different story because they are such basic tasks that are required regularly for any adult. \n\nThis feels like rage bait tbh", "Info: what does your fianc\u00e9e do around the house?\n\nThe things you are complaining about are heavily gendered tasks (car care, lawn maintenance, home update/repair). I can tell you I was the only one of my friends whose parents taught them those sorts of skills.\n\nI do have some sympathy for her here. Changing a tire may be easy if you\u2019ve done it, but jacking your car and changing a tire, which done incorrectly is dangerous, is scary. Some with a lawnmower if you don\u2019t have experience, or working with electrical.\n\nShe needs to communicate better why those tasks feel so daunting to her that she would rather just leave them undone. Learning to change light switches is not the same as learning to do the dishes.\n\nWithout more info, ESH", "NTA, but you will be if you don't break this engagement and run", "NTA but she has zero reason to change. You still bought a house with her, you are still engaged to her, you still went and changed the tire, you still mowed the lawn. Why change what's working for her?", "YTA. Unless you've got better examples of weaponized incompetence, these are totally unfair. I am \\*physically\\* unable to remove the bolts to change a tire (I've tried). For the lawn mower, I've had this exact same situation happen - he explained how it worked, I tried, and couldn't get it to start. Guess what? What's obvious to you isn't so simple for someone who has never done it before! There's a question of comparative advantage - does it make more sense for someone to learn a completely new skill (and practice it to get good enough at it) or does it make sense for their PARTNER, for whom it's second nature, to continue to do the task? That's the discussion you should be having, but you sound like a judgmental ass who doesn't like his fiancee, so why are even with her? The use of the word incompetent is pretty unforgivable, so yeah, YTA.", "INFO:  Do you even like your fianc\u00e9?  The way you talk about her is incredibly demeaning.", "YTA. Like, 1000 x. And I'm basing this primarily on the \"Watch Youtube. Learn how to change a tire\" comment. You do understand that you can get in a car accident and die from an incorrectly installed tire, right? And Youtube isn't always a reliable source of information. Learning how to paint a wall? Fine. Changing a tire? Nope. \n\nMoving on with the tire and adding the lawnmower ... Lawnmowers are scary things to operate if you're not used to them. I can see how your fiancee is hesitant to work one on her own.  And she doesn't know how to switch out switchplates. So the fuck what? \n\nYour fiancee not knowing how to do this stuff is not weaponized incompetence. Just because you can do certain tasks she can't does NOT make her incompetent. She doesn't deserve the demeaning, patriarchal tone you use to talk about her in this post. And I would LOVE to see a post from her discussing all the stuff she can do that you cannot.", "Is this a repost, u bet I\u2019ve read this exact same thing on here before.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s weaponizing her incompetence. She\u2019s an adult, and a homeowner she needs to stop acting like an idiot", "She just sounds really childish. Maybe she didn't have to do anything around the house as a child and just doesn't have knowledge or initiative. This is not going to be resolved overnight.", "NTA. This girl is lazy AF and is using it to manipulate you. Do not marry this. You will spend your life with a woman who doesn't respect you. She needs to grow up and stop being intentionally incompetent. Can you imagine having to rely on her for even basic needs?", "This isn\u2019t going to be fun to hear, but do not marry this person. You will not be happy.", "NAH it\u2019s your right to have these views on how responsibility is split. It\u2019s her right too. Maybe you guys just don\u2019t see eye to eye on the rather important issue. On a side note, you really took the time to learn how to do something (the light switches) and instead of just doing them  you wanted her to learn how to do something she probably will never have to do again. Sounds petty", "ESH.  Why would you \"split\" something like swapping out light switch covers?  Either do all of them or do none of them.  Don't split every chore 50/50, split the \\_type\\_ of chore 50/50 (you mow, she does stuff she can do.)", "[deleted]", "I don't think it's that weird for the man to do those tasks/chores. My husband and I have a good understanding of this. He's a foot taller and 100 lbs bigger than I am so he does the 'harder' labor around the house, which he usually only has to do once every week or two. I do the daily house chores and 99% of the cooking. It works really well for us. How often does she do the daily house chores, like dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc?", "INFO \n\nIs she doing more of the day to day cleaning? Meal prep, tidying, laundry, vacuuming etc? \n\nYour examples point to 2 \u201conce in a while\u201d tasks that yeah, are traditionally \u201cman\u201d jobs if that\u2019s how she was raised- and she clearly was. \n\nYou also seem to think it\u2019s normal to always alternate chores? That may work for you but my husband and I have always had chores we both do and try to generally keep equal, but mostly we have our individual chores- I\u2019m better at cooking, he\u2019s better at laundry, etc. \n\nI get that she comes off sexist here but let\u2019s face it- the topic of housework is fraught with different social expectations. \n\nAnd again your preferred way of splitting chores by closely monitoring an alternating pattern may seem quite unusual to her. \n\nI think you need to really engage in an open conversation here, and before you do, really reflect- are there things she\u2019s doing day to day that she simply owns and doesn\u2019t expect to alternate? Are there perhaps tasks that are traditional gender roles that she does competently?\n\nAgain. She sounds pretty terrible here but when we boil it down it sounds like if she expects traditional gender roles, she\u2019s still pulling her weight- it\u2019s just not the dynamic that works for you.", "Yeah your the asshole completely and fully", "Sorry to ask this, but did she finish her schooling? She seems a few points short in the IQ department", "YTA. You knew all this about her and still you dated and asked her to marry you and bought a house with her. What were the changes that kept you progressing through all of these stages in the relationship?", "YTA and this isn't weaponised incompetence. You are insisting she learn infrequent tasks that are potentially dangerous and require physical strength but not daily tasks that are frequent and time consuming. The point of sharing household tasks is that they are equally time consuming, so that one person is not spending more hours a week on domestic labour. So why don't you ask her to do more cooking, cleaning, laundry or other time consuming tasks if you are genuinely spending more hours on domstic labour per week? Honestly this feels like a if genders were reversed troll comment that fundamentally doesn't understand what weaponised incompetence is.", "*learn basic tasks or doing them poorly so I have to re-do them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlready yes.

This whole notion that  you are the master of anything done right.I completely  believe you are more capable of doing remedial tasks but that doesn't make her incompetent.There are many brilliant people who don't know how to start a lawn mower.

That's doing things but doing them badly so you have to redo them.\n\nYou didnt say if she was even strong enough to turn the bolts on her car. Just that she has to do it herself. I'm not saying she was right to wait 3hours but why didnt she call her dad? He is clearly a reliable man who wants to help the women he loves. \n\nThe lawnmower one I might give you but what type of lawnmower is it? I wouldnt use one that uses petrol as I hate those ones.

My neighbour has one and his wife never uses it just him, she does the weeding instead.\n\nThe electrical sockets I would never replace myself, nope not messing with them. I'd either get a man in my family to do it or hire someone. I'd rather not chance getting electrocuted. You know how to do that and could have very easily you choose not to. I can only see it as being petty on your part.\n\nI dont know any men who wouldnt do the electric for their wife but I guess that's not you.", "ESH\nIs this for real?\nMaybe she should just call some muscular handyman to do all these chores.\nOr maybe have an adult discussion and instead of behave childishly, split the chores by each one\u2019s ability and knowledge?\nAnd how normal it is to mow the grass every single week?!?", "ESH, you're going to be the asshole in her eyes for that comment for a long time, but I get where you're coming from. I mean seriously, it's not that hard, but I had an ex like that as well. Not only would she not lift a finger to do anything but then she made it harder by interrupting me while I was doing said chore, so she could ask me to do something else for her. Good luck bud", "ESH - Maybe the best option would be to teach her, ask her to practice and then make a divided chores list and so on. Tbh - I didn't know how to change a tire til my husband and his step-dad showed me how, til my dad showed me how to use a mower, etc. If she isn't willing to lean though, that's a different story. The last one though makes it seem like maybe she's not even willing to. In which case that's pretty much on her and needs more of a serious sit down discussion and her willingness to change. \nBut calling her incompetent was not a solution either and there are a lot of better ways to go about this.

You said you split chores and do most of the cooking (you sound like a great partner on that front) but I wonder if she organizes all the holidays, buys all the birthday gifts, organizes trips, keeps the social calendar, deals with your family,  mediates disputes and does the emotional caretaking, makes all the house appointments, etc. so that she might unconsciously think car emergencies, lawn care and home improvement projects are in your court? Seems like you both have some unspoken assumptions that could use a good hashing out.\n\nI will also say that over the recent generations, Americans have gotten better at teaching young dudes how to cook, clean, take care of kids, handle some of the emotional load of households, etc. I don't think we've done as great a job at making sure teenagers of the lady persuasion know how to change their car's oil/tires, mow the lawn, clean the gutters, do basic home repair, etc. Many parents do teach their girls (brava!) but there are so many of us who rent our first apartment, buy our first car, etc. without knowing how to be \"handy\" for lack of a better word. \n\nI had to learn everything from trial and error with search engine help.

That's him. \n\nAlso, I'm a tall lady with major shoulders who bench press as much as most men, but my hands just aren't large enough/strong enough to get the dang lug nuts off the tire when I get a flat.

They'd never been taught how to do anything, and they'd never been taught that they were competent or capable of doing anything. It wasn't weaponized incompetence (they weren't asking me to do stuff for them), they just lacked the self confidence and the knowledge that a lot of house tasks are easy. A lot of women I think are raised to be helpless either on purpose or just because parents don't prioritize teaching handiness skills to girls, or because little girls don't want to learn to unclog a toilet and are allowed not to learn how. Which is a tragedy.

I took time the last time I was home to teach him how to change an outlet. I answer his calls about how to take care of life's annoyances (clogged drain, when to call your landlord about stuff, how to get a security deposit back, etc). The difference between my sibling and your fiance is my sibling WANTS to be able to do these things. \n\nYour fiance has zero desire to learn these things. Is that a deal breaker?
