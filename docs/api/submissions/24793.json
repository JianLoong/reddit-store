I told her I can't leave work because I have an important meeting, and she will have to change it herself. She calls me again, THREE HOURS later, asking if my meeting was over and if I could help now. I asked why she didn't just put on her spare tire, to which she said didn't know how, so instead she went in got food at a cafe nearby and left her car.  I asked why, in two hours, she didn't just GOOGLE how to change a tire? She said her dad has always come and changed her tire for her. I was pretty annoyed and told her I'm not her \"dad\" so she will need to learn how to do these types of things, but ultimately left work to help her change the tire. She also hasn't made any attempt to learn how to change a tire since then.\n2. We recently bought a home and it's the first time either of us have had a yard. We split chores 'evenly' (in reality I end up doing more, on top of all the cooking). I mowed the first week and when the second week rolled around, I pointed out that it was her turn since the grass was getting long, and the next day was one of the few days where it wouldn't be extremely hot. She looked absolutely puzzled because apparently she just assumed I was always going to be the one to mow? She said she didn't know how to start the mower, so I showed her how to start it, adjust the height, add gas etc and she agreed to mow the next day. I came home from work and she hadn't mowed and I asked why. She said she couldn't start the mower. It's a brand new honda mower that's probably the easiest thing to start on earth.  Annoyingly, the mower was in the exact spot from the day before, so I know she didn't even TRY!\n3. Recently we bought new light switches (her request) since the old ones were ugly and cream colored. There were about 16 of them in total that needed swapped out. I told her I would swap out the ones downstairs if she does the ones upstairs. I did mine that day, and she said she'd do hers later. Well, 5 weeks passed, and I asked if she was ever going to swap them out. She told me she couldn't figure it out. Mind you, I'd NEVER done this before either, but I watched a 5 minutes youtube video and just read the instructions and it was pretty easy.\n\nI ask again if she is going to do them, and she says \"I'll probably just leave them as-is since they don't look that bad\". I was furious. SHE was the one who wanted them, I bought them. Because she took so long to do it, they were past the return date, so basically I'm forced to do it. I told her I'm tired of her weaponized incompetence, and she said she's not doing it \"on purpose\" -- so then I told her maybe it's just regular incompetence then. She's still upset at me.

She deserved to be called out.", "NTA. Because she is choosing to be incompetent. She's not unintelligent, she just doesn't care as much as you do, and I think by just \"waiting\" she is effectively ensuring you will do the task.\n\nYou guys need to have a real talk about chores and division of labor. Decide which you will do, which she will do, and what you want to outsource. I don't know how to change a tire (well, theoretically i do, but I've never done it), but I do know how to sign up for AAA roadside service. My husband doesn't mow grass because ... allergies, so sometimes I do it, and sometimes I've just hired out a lawn service. \n\nBeing the One Who Nags is awful, but if she is going to shirk on chores, don't expect that to EVER change. I am married for a long time to someone who STILL needs to be told to clear his dishes and asked to empty the dishwasher. He will NEVER do it on his own!", "I can understand her not wanting to change the tire, especially if it's in a dangerous spot, but dang there's a bunch of options she could have chosen within those three hours. \n\nNTA, but I think you've enabled her to this point. The problem is she doesn't make the effort and knows almost no matter what that you will just do the job for her. \n\nThe red flag is waving right in your face. You are going to be in an extremely unhappy and potentially short marriage if this cannot be resolved.", "NTA and I'd have probably said the same thing in your shoes. Not only is she unwilling to learn, she can't be bothered to keep her word, nor can she be bothered to be honest about what she is or is not willing to do. My guess is that she considered many of the tasks you described as \"man's work\" which is BS but sadly so common amongst people about gendered divisions of labor.\n\nSpeaking from experience I swapped out about 100 switches when my partner and I bought our house and had never done it before. It's not hard. But I did screw up by not realizing that 3 way switches are different than 2 way so that sucked to re-do a bunch of them. But ya know what? I learned! And I'm a woman. Who'd have thunk it?!", "NTA. If you were a woman posting about her boyfriend who refuses to learn to do dishes or sweep the floor, these comments would be applauding you. She's intentionally refusing to learn how to do these chores so YOU end up having to do them.

Nobody wants a life time of this.", "Items 2 and 3 are super annoying. In her defense, I don't change my own tire either unless I'm in the middle of nowhere. This is why I have insurance with roadside assistance. So often it just isn't safe to change it if you're a woman alone. However, this does look like it's part of a larger trend, so I'll say NTA.", "INFO I think a breakdown of what each of you does around the house is required.", "Info : what qualities did u like to make her your partner?", "NTA. I will say though I know all the steps of changing a tire, I keep all the tools and the spare required in my trunk, but I still have to call for help to change them because I\u2019m physically not strong enough. I\u2019ve literally tried jumping on the wrench before to get it to move but I just don\u2019t have the mass. Everything else she could do though so I agree with you.", "Here's the thing...have you tried teaching her?  Instead of leaving it up to her Googling or YouTubing something, show her how it's done.  Ask her what she needs help with.  Some people are seriously worried about F'ing up something (myself included) and having someone to show how to do it (instead of relying on them going out and discovering out) can make all the difference.", "The tyre thing yeah nta but the light switch thing, if neither of you knew why not do it and learn together? Encourage her? She may not be confident with things like this. I'm definitely not and feel much better if my partner and I work through things together. Doing the light switches separately screams weirdness to me - you have a shared house why not share the learning of the new stuff instead of getting angry with her?", "NTA\n\nIt IS weaponized incompetence and this is what you will have for the rest of your lives together.  She has been spoiled and enabled and will expect you do to everything around the house going forward.\n\nTHINK about this relationship.", "YTA for treating your fianc\u00e9e as a roommate. Have some patience with her. Show her how to do things instead of expecting her to look it up on Google. And then help her the first time she has to do it.\n\nAre you not willing to grow with your partner? I'm seriously puzzled as to why you are with her, given the way you speak about her.", "NTA", "First, I need to know what responsibilities your fianc\u00e9e has around the house and in general before I have a definite thought on this.  I've never had to change a tire and so you lost me on that one and also the electrical switches too.  Both these tasks need to be safely and correctly done so I'm not even sure that's a reasonable thing to foist on her.  As for mowing, we ALL can mow and should.  But, first, I need to know what she does contribute to this relationship.", "I don\u2019t think this is weaponised incompetence because these aren\u2019t all common jobs that anyone can feel comfortable doing (lawn mowing is the exception).\nMaybe it\u2019s just me but i know loads of men and women who can\u2019t/don\u2019t change tyres or change their own light switches. There\u2019s a very real danger of doing it wrong.\n\nBut if a man or woman pretends they \u201cdon\u2019t see mess\u201d or can\u2019t do dishes/laundry that\u2019s a different story because they are such basic tasks that are required regularly for any adult. \n\nThis feels like rage bait tbh", "Info: what does your fianc\u00e9e do around the house?\n\nThe things you are complaining about are heavily gendered tasks (car care, lawn maintenance, home update/repair). I can tell you I was the only one of my friends whose parents taught them those sorts of skills.\n\nI do have some sympathy for her here. Changing a tire may be easy if you\u2019ve done it, but jacking your car and changing a tire, which done incorrectly is dangerous, is scary. Some with a lawnmower if you don\u2019t have experience, or working with electrical.\n\nShe needs to communicate better why those tasks feel so daunting to her that she would rather just leave them undone. Learning to change light switches is not the same as learning to do the dishes.\n\nWithout more info, ESH", "NTA, but you will be if you don't break this engagement and run", "NTA but she has zero reason to change. You still bought a house with her, you are still engaged to her, you still went and changed the tire, you still mowed the lawn. Why change what's working for her?", "YTA. Unless you've got better examples of weaponized incompetence, these are totally unfair. I am \\*physically\\* unable to remove the bolts to change a tire (I've tried). For the lawn mower, I've had this exact same situation happen - he explained how it worked, I tried, and couldn't get it to start. Guess what? What's obvious to you isn't so simple for someone who has never done it before! There's a question of comparative advantage - does it make more sense for someone to learn a completely new skill (and practice it to get good enough at it) or does it make sense for their PARTNER, for whom it's second nature, to continue to do the task? That's the discussion you should be having, but you sound like a judgmental ass who doesn't like his fiancee, so why are even with her? The use of the word incompetent is pretty unforgivable, so yeah, YTA.", "INFO:  Do you even like your fianc\u00e9?  The way you talk about her is incredibly demeaning.", "YTA. Like, 1000 x. And I'm basing this primarily on the \"Watch Youtube. Learn how to change a tire\" comment. You do understand that you can get in a car accident and die from an incorrectly installed tire, right? And Youtube isn't always a reliable source of information. Learning how to paint a wall? Fine. Changing a tire? Nope. \n\nMoving on with the tire and adding the lawnmower ... Lawnmowers are scary things to operate if you're not used to them. I can see how your fiancee is hesitant to work one on her own.  And she doesn't know how to switch out switchplates. So the fuck what? \n\nYour fiancee not knowing how to do this stuff is not weaponized incompetence. Just because you can do certain tasks she can't does NOT make her incompetent. She doesn't deserve the demeaning, patriarchal tone you use to talk about her in this post. And I would LOVE to see a post from her discussing all the stuff she can do that you cannot.", "Is this a repost, u bet I\u2019ve read this exact same thing on here before.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s weaponizing her incompetence. She\u2019s an adult, and a homeowner she needs to stop acting like an idiot", "She just sounds really childish. Maybe she didn't have to do anything around the house as a child and just doesn't have knowledge or initiative. This is not going to be resolved overnight.", "NTA. This girl is lazy AF and is using it to manipulate you. Do not marry this. You will spend your life with a woman who doesn't respect you. She needs to grow up and stop being intentionally incompetent. Can you imagine having to rely on her for even basic needs?", "This isn\u2019t going to be fun to hear, but do not marry this person. You will not be happy.", "NAH it\u2019s your right to have these views on how responsibility is split. It\u2019s her right too. Maybe you guys just don\u2019t see eye to eye on the rather important issue. On a side note, you really took the time to learn how to do something (the light switches) and instead of just doing them  you wanted her to learn how to do something she probably will never have to do again. Sounds petty", "ESH.  Why would you \"split\" something like swapping out light switch covers?  Either do all of them or do none of them.  Don't split every chore 50/50, split the \\_type\\_ of chore 50/50 (you mow, she does stuff she can do.)", "[deleted]", "I don't think it's that weird for the man to do those tasks/chores. My husband and I have a good understanding of this. He's a foot taller and 100 lbs bigger than I am so he does the 'harder' labor around the house, which he usually only has to do once every week or two. I do the daily house chores and 99% of the cooking. It works really well for us. How often does she do the daily house chores, like dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc?", "INFO \n\nIs she doing more of the day to day cleaning? Meal prep, tidying, laundry, vacuuming etc? \n\nYour examples point to 2 \u201conce in a while\u201d tasks that yeah, are traditionally \u201cman\u201d jobs if that\u2019s how she was raised- and she clearly was. \n\nYou also seem to think it\u2019s normal to always alternate chores? That may work for you but my husband and I have always had chores we both do and try to generally keep equal, but mostly we have our individual chores- I\u2019m better at cooking, he\u2019s better at laundry, etc. \n\nI get that she comes off sexist here but let\u2019s face it- the topic of housework is fraught with different social expectations. \n\nAnd again your preferred way of splitting chores by closely monitoring an alternating pattern may seem quite unusual to her. \n\nI think you need to really engage in an open conversation here, and before you do, really reflect- are there things she\u2019s doing day to day that she simply owns and doesn\u2019t expect to alternate? Are there perhaps tasks that are traditional gender roles that she does competently?\n\nAgain. She sounds pretty terrible here but when we boil it down it sounds like if she expects traditional gender roles, she\u2019s still pulling her weight- it\u2019s just not the dynamic that works for you.", "[deleted]", "Sorry to ask this, but did she finish her schooling? She seems a few points short in the IQ department", "YTA. You knew all this about her and still you dated and asked her to marry you and bought a house with her. What were the changes that kept you progressing through all of these stages in the relationship?", "YTA and this isn't weaponised incompetence. You are insisting she learn infrequent tasks that are potentially dangerous and require physical strength but not daily tasks that are frequent and time consuming. The point of sharing household tasks is that they are equally time consuming, so that one person is not spending more hours a week on domestic labour. So why don't you ask her to do more cooking, cleaning, laundry or other time consuming tasks if you are genuinely spending more hours on domstic labour per week? Honestly this feels like a if genders were reversed troll comment that fundamentally doesn't understand what weaponised incompetence is.", "*learn basic tasks or doing them poorly so I have to re-do them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlready yes. YTA. This whole notion that  you are the master of anything done right.I completely  believe you are more capable of doing remedial tasks but that doesn't make her incompetent.There are many brilliant people who don't know how to start a lawn mower.

That's doing things but doing them badly so you have to redo them.\n\nYou didnt say if she was even strong enough to turn the bolts on her car. Just that she has to do it herself. I'm not saying she was right to wait 3hours but why didnt she call her dad? He is clearly a reliable man who wants to help the women he loves. \n\nThe lawnmower one I might give you but what type of lawnmower is it? I wouldnt use one that uses petrol as I hate those ones.

My neighbour has one and his wife never uses it just him, she does the weeding instead.\n\nThe electrical sockets I would never replace myself, nope not messing with them. I'd either get a man in my family to do it or hire someone. I'd rather not chance getting electrocuted. You know how to do that and could have very easily you choose not to. I can only see it as being petty on your part.\n\nI dont know any men who wouldnt do the electric for their wife but I guess that's not you.", "ESH\nIs this for real?\nMaybe she should just call some muscular handyman to do all these chores.\nOr maybe have an adult discussion and instead of behave childishly, split the chores by each one\u2019s ability and knowledge?\nAnd how normal it is to mow the grass every single week?!?", "ESH, you're going to be the asshole in her eyes for that comment for a long time, but I get where you're coming from. I mean seriously, it's not that hard, but I had an ex like that as well. Not only would she not lift a finger to do anything but then she made it harder by interrupting me while I was doing said chore, so she could ask me to do something else for her. Good luck bud", "ESH - Maybe the best option would be to teach her, ask her to practice and then make a divided chores list and so on. Tbh - I didn't know how to change a tire til my husband and his step-dad showed me how, til my dad showed me how to use a mower, etc. If she isn't willing to lean though, that's a different story. The last one though makes it seem like maybe she's not even willing to. In which case that's pretty much on her and needs more of a serious sit down discussion and her willingness to change. \nBut calling her incompetent was not a solution either and there are a lot of better ways to go about this.

You said you split chores and do most of the cooking (you sound like a great partner on that front) but I wonder if she organizes all the holidays, buys all the birthday gifts, organizes trips, keeps the social calendar, deals with your family,  mediates disputes and does the emotional caretaking, makes all the house appointments, etc. so that she might unconsciously think car emergencies, lawn care and home improvement projects are in your court? Seems like you both have some unspoken assumptions that could use a good hashing out.\n\nI will also say that over the recent generations, Americans have gotten better at teaching young dudes how to cook, clean, take care of kids, handle some of the emotional load of households, etc. I don't think we've done as great a job at making sure teenagers of the lady persuasion know how to change their car's oil/tires, mow the lawn, clean the gutters, do basic home repair, etc. Many parents do teach their girls (brava!) but there are so many of us who rent our first apartment, buy our first car, etc. without knowing how to be \"handy\" for lack of a better word. \n\nI had to learn everything from trial and error with search engine help.

That's him. \n\nAlso, I'm a tall lady with major shoulders who bench press as much as most men, but my hands just aren't large enough/strong enough to get the dang lug nuts off the tire when I get a flat.

It wasn't weaponized incompetence (they weren't asking me to do stuff for them), they just lacked the self confidence and the knowledge that a lot of house tasks are easy. A lot of women I think are raised to be helpless either on purpose or just because parents don't prioritize teaching handiness skills to girls, or because little girls don't want to learn to unclog a toilet and are allowed not to learn how. Which is a tragedy.

That's just lazy and entitled.", "The first time I managed to pull it and get it to work I got such I fright I let go of the handle thing (it's a self propelled lawn mower) and it shut off so I had to try again for another five minutes", "(i certainly never do. rapid temperature changes can crack delicate items, especially the old ones.)", "Right. There is zero reason why every member of the house needs to do every chore. It\u2019s not even super efficient to do it that way. If this is a real post they need to have a talk.", "Exactly. I CAN change a tire, and have in the past, but now I have roadside assistance so I let someone else get paid to do it for me becuase I don't fucking want to. I can't imagine telling a SO they have to leave work for such nonsense.", "You would think that, but that\u2019s not entirely true. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. \n\nFor example, my mom was very particular about cleaning. My chore would be to clean the bathroom, she would check my work and make me go back and fix it. Point out everything to clean and how to do it properly. \n\nMy husband on the other hand, grew up in a house that wasn\u2019t clean. No one regularly vacuumed, no one regularly mopped, and to him, That was normal to them. \n\nOne night, after repeatedly getting mad at my husband for his poor cleaning, my husband and I had a big fight, We have dogs that track in lots of dirt, and I told my husband he would need more than one mop pad to get the floor clean. He told me I was wrong and proceeded to clean the floor with one mop pad. The floor \u201clooked clean\u201d but I knew it wasn\u2019t, so I took the swifter, used 6 mop pads and mopped again. I slapped them down next to him and said, \u201cDoes this look clean?\u201d (That was a little bitchy, but I was annoyed and felt vindicated.) He acknowledged I was right. \n\nIt was shortly after that I realized he have never been taught to clean. Sure he knew the basics, but he didn\u2019t see the dirt in the corners and around the edges like I did because I was taught to notice them. Sure he can clean something, but some people haven\u2019t been shown how to really clean, had someone check their work, then teach them the right way, or a better way. Sure, it seems like something should be obvious, but if someone hasn\u2019t had the same life experience as you, it might not be as obvious to them. \n\nAlso, as someone with late diagnosed sever ADHD, I have envied people my entire life for their ease to do certain things. It should be easy to change light switches, but sometime my brain won\u2019t let me get up and eat when I haven\u2019t for 16 hours, let alone get up and change light switches, even though I wish I should get it done. I swear some days my brain would just let me died instead of doing the things I need too. Medication had changed my life and made things easier. Maybe there is something more going on that need to be address other than just pure laziness. \n\n\nThe tire thing I have no excuse for, except for maybe just being overwhelmed. Some peoples easy is another persons hard,.", "sure, but chances are if the lugs are on that tight, most men are going to need to call some form of professional roadside assist too, but Ops Fiancee wasn't willing to attempt even that much. More to the point, we don't actually know if the lugs on her tire were that tight, because she wasn't willing to even try.", "No it's not scary in general.", "I agree with your second sentence to an extent, but the approach of assigning the task to the person who is currently most efficient at it serves to perpetuate the initial difference in fluency, which does not necessarily serve the less proficient partner in the long run. The fianc\u00e9e is not going to build skills by continuing to dump tasks on OP that intimidate her. It's not so much these specific tasks, but the fact that the fianc\u00e9e does not seem willing to try to learn at all; I suspect because she hasn't had enough experiences where she tried something new and succeeded, to be willing to figure things out on the fly using a YouTube tutorial.\n\nOP should be more compassionate - belittling her is also not the way to build her skill and willingness to try - and they should realise that learning new skills is a meta-skill that they have likely practiced more than their fianc\u00e9e. (OP, look up \"I Do, We Do, You Do\" as a way to overcome this.)\n\nReturning to my original point, your approach to division also doesn't necessarily take into account that people can hate things they're very good at, or simply not want to do them all the time, and they shouldn't get saddled with them just because their partner sucks at those same tasks. OP should not have to pick up the slack on every task in future that the fianc\u00e9e has unilaterally decided is not in her wheelhouse.\n\nYou've said labour, which can include mental labour, but that's not necessarily visible to the other person. I ended up being responsible for too much meal preparation (and a ton more stuff, but that's the one that's been the most damaging) because to my partner it looked like I found it easy, simply because I had a few years' practice feeding myself compared to his zero. In reality, we both had undiagnosed ADHD, and the planning-and-initiating responsibilities that were being dumped on me were taking energy I absolutely did not have to spare after a long day of unknowingly masking at work and seeming like I had my shit together, leading to severe burnout. Fast forward, we're both medicated now, he has a few dishes he makes much better than I do, and more importantly, he's realised he's just as capable of typing in random ingredients into Google to find a recipe as I ever was. But I'm still unpacking the damage of having associated maintaining my physical self with the experience of further depleting my mental and emotional self; I've basically had to rebuild my relationship with food.\n\nIt's easy to say, \"use your words\" \"communicate\" \"negotiate\", which I absolutely did, but it did not help. Not because my partner was being lazy or unwilling to listen, but because we were both struggling, and while I was saying \"It's hard\", it did not look that way to him compared to his own feeling of \"I can't\".\n\nOP, if you proceed with this marriage, prepare yourself for either a lifetime of doing everything yourself, or being a kind and patient enough partner to create a safe space for your wife to acknowledge that she can and should learn to do more for herself.", "Cause she seems to be lazy af from the number 2 where he did teach her and she still didn\u2019t do jack shit. If number 2 was left out then yeah maybe she just isn\u2019t confident and just not a very competent person no she just lazy. Also, if you ask for something to be done and you agree to split the tasks then you do your part instead of using the same excuse of IDK I\u2019ll do it later actually I realize that if I want this I will have to work which is a huge no no so actually I like the old ones teehee. Adults shouldn\u2019t need encouragement for chores, she is a child in adult clothing who uses the exact same excuses as children who don\u2019t want to do chores. So either she is immature and lazy or stupid as hell.", "I have the issue with my car as the bolt require a specific tool (that is in the toolbox and not in the car).\nBut I am able to use a phone so last time it happened, I called the insurance and they dealt with it\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t have a yard and made it clear to SO that if he wants a yard or a dog, I have no issue but he will have to manage by himself (I won\u2019t walk the dog at 6AM on a rainy day \ud83d\ude02 and I\u2019m a great plant killer despite following all the advice and instructions that I follow, it\u2019s actually quite distressing to me). Rules are clear. \nFor the rest, we share chores as much as possible.\n\nOP, NTA but you need to determine if it\u2019s genuine or not.\nIf she\u2019s just like that, without trying to manipulate you, then you have to decide if it\u2019s a deal breaker for you. My sister is like that and honestly, I couldn\u2019t live with someone like her.\nIf she is manipulative, then maybe you should stop this relation because it won\u2019t get better (SIL is a manipulative narcissist so we had to cut ties). \nGood luck!", "Yea, I don\u2019t think I could physically change a tire even if I knew how. But I know I can call other people. And the lawnmower? I do get it. Mine is brand new. My arm isn\u2019t quite long enough to start it and if I try to hard, I throw out my back, thanks to scoliosis. But I still do mow the lawn, I just need my partner to start it for me since he\u2019s got a slightly longer wingspan. I\u2019m like 1-2 inches off, so close. But not quite. But still. I make an effort and I do what I can, just might need help getting started. And if he can\u2019t help, I know how to figure it out. Even if it means mowing the lawn in the heat.", "I've changed a tire alone multiple times, I'm a woman. \n\nThe last time I tried it wouldn't come off. I tried for an hour. All of my weight, all of my strength, it wouldn't come off. I had to call a service. Tire was jammed or whatever it's called. \n\nBut, 3 hours of not trying. No. \n\nMy partner asked me stuff all the time and I ask him if he looked it up, he says no... I say look it up then. \n\nI use search engines to my advantage constantly. Information is at our fingertips and I will take advantage of that as long as it's available.", "Yeah so..you just learn and do better and become more comfortable? That's the stuff you push past that makes you..be better at doing them?", "I turned off the main fuse when doing anything to include swapping out the thermostat. Not only am I paranoid of getting shocked, I\u2019m afraid of creating an electrical fire down the road and all of dying bc I didn\u2019t tighten or over tightened a nut. I call my friend who has electrical experience. But I do try\u2026this fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t even trying. \n\n\nETA:If this is the reason for this then she needs to communicate this. Waiting 3 hours to fix a flat bc she didn\u2019t even think to call roadside assistance (included with most insurances nowadays) is ridiculous. Communication is key\u2026she either needs to have valid reasons for this aversions but she can\u2019t just lie and not attempt. \n\n\n\nI also practice taking my tires off and putting on the spare. I randomly watch YouTube videos on how to check my brakes and struts (I did succeed in changing a strut with supervision and a mechanic checked my worked).

Bc I\u2019m a single mom and I can\u2019t afford a mechanic for every little thing.
