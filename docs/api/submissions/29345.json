Your mother and sister either lived their entire lives inside a jam jar or are lying through their teeth. Not wearing white or colors too close to white is the most basic etiquette for weddings. \n\nHonestly I think people waste their time when they antagonize this kind of thing by bringing up the bride's wishes and the need for respecting the couple's events. People willing to do this kind of crap care more about attention than about other's feelings. So I would just say the plain truth: wearing a bridal-like dress to a wedding as a guest is crass as all hell. No one ever praised a woman for wearing white or a train to someone else's wedding, rather they spend the following weeks tearing her apart behind her back. \n\nSo I'd tell your sister unless she wants to be a pitiful laughing stock for weeks or embarrass herself by making herself be thrown out of the wedding (or uninvited altogether), she should choose a different dress.", "NTA.  If at a glance it looks white you shouldn\u2019t wear it.  Off white and a train?  Seriously inappropriate.  I don\u2019t get how they don\u2019t see it as inappropriate.  The bride is going to be upset if she wears that dress.", "NTA\n\nBut the bride needs to engage with your mother and Sister over this. You have said your bit, they have not listened. Speak to the Bride and let her deal with it.\n\nIf she won't then so be it", "NTA, If the sister is reacting to a certain dress on a wedding then that means she must\u2019ve been planning to take the attention away from the bride", "NTA but since reasonable nice people would respect the bride and groom's wishes, they may need to be ready with a response that your sister will feel is not kind. \n\nOne option is to have all the women wear white gowns - their old wedding gowns if they have them and can fit in them - while the bride wears a stunning dress in her favorite color. Your sister would blend into the background crowd while the bride looks fabulous.\n\nAnother possibility would be to have security who will prevent your sister or anyone else dressed inappropriately from being able to access the wedding venue. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. I think that they should at least comply with what the BRIDE is asking them to do.", "NTA, your family is dumb for not knowing you can't wear basically a brides dress if you're not the bride\n\nBride is also dumb for not letting everyone know what kind of attire is expected", "NTA OP and tell the bride what is going on then she will have a serious talk with mum and sisters. Dress codes are implemented for a good reason when it comes to the bride. You are not the bad guy for doing the right thing to show respect for the bride", "NTA, but this is in the bride\u2019s hands now.  She has a few options available to her:\n  1. Talk to your mom and sis herself\n  2. Disinvite your mom and sis - will end the stress real quick\n  3. Get a bridesmaid on red wine duty", "NTA - tf is wrong with your mom and sister? I\u2019m shooketh.", "\n\nNTA but I think you already knew that. I\u2019m going to give you some perspective, with a smudge truth about common occurrences within most families that\u2019s hardly spoke of. \n\n(Also, bad at English, I apologise for mistakes, it\u2019s 7:30, I\u2019ve not slept, my brains broken, and I have a medical condition so, I\u2019m a dope. I was going to correct but I\u2019m too tired. So good luck).\n\nYou\u2019re a bridesmaid, & your sisters not. Whether your sisters \u201cbothered\u201d or not by this, a statement has been made. \n\nA very clear & obvious thing has happened which is thanks to two peoples views of, betrayal, jealousy, anger, & childish behaviour as acceptable response. \n\nIn most families there\u2019s an A team, and an B team, obviously there could be more, after the two, but we\u2019re focusing on these for this argument. \n\nRight now, Bride is A team. \n\nNow think of A team as school, they\u2019re the popular kids. They get the good grades, the attention, whatever. Then there\u2019s the B team. They\u2019re just as popular, but they\u2019re nicer, to everyone, who slags off the A team with them. \n\nNow picture yourself as a floater in high school. The vibe kid who could float anywhere they wish and be chill with all. \n\nNot many people can have that role without repercussions. Once you stepped out of the safe ground, by voicing your opinions (regardless of if they\u2019re true or not) you picked a side, in B teams mind. \n\nTherefore betrayal and anger are the factors, once again. These people are yet again, faced with being B team all their life, and now, someone they saw as a chill vibe person, (who was A team material, but was a technical OG B team) has picked a side they shouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s a hit. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re in the wrong. I\u2019ll pose this to you, to take back to them, if your mothers been married, ask to see wedding pictures. Without exposing why, and when you find them, ask why nobody wore white or off white, or whatever the rule is, and yet she knew nothing of the rules. \n\nBut, fun fact, if she pulls it out, and there\u2019s ONE girl doing it in the wedding, you\u2019ll understand why she\u2019s going it. To either encourage the behaviour she faced years ago, or genuine unawareness. In which case, it\u2019s time to educate. \n\nGood luck anyway. I know picking \u201csides\u201d when you don\u2019t want to, can be a hard thing.", "NTA\n\nI'd make the dress disappear until after the wedding if I could. But I'm cheeky like that...", "Is something wrong with your sister what\u2019s the deal there because you\u2019re family minus the bride apparently thinks you\u2019re an asshole", "NTA etiquette is what it is and telling your mum and sister of the problem before is kindness.\n\nTheir being assholes for blaming you for their ignorance. \n\nTo help the bride, suggest measures to be made so that sister is either uninvited beforehand or turned away if they come wearing the dress. Mother or father of the bride is typically a good person to handle this mess if the wedding is being organised by them. ( invites are being sent in their name)", "NTA. Wait for sis to be uninvited.

If your sister ever has a wedding, you can be damn sure they'll have heard about guests not wearing certain colors or styles.", "Have someone at the door to turn away anyone wearing white or similar colors. Have a second person in place with grape juice or red wine to spray them if they happen to get past the guard.", "NTA. Got a pair of scissors?", "NTA \n\nBut go ahead and moonwalk right out of that disagreement. That\u2019s not your battle to fight friendo. Tell your sister and your mom that your intentions were to save them embarrassment, but now that they know about the concern what they do with that information is up to them. And tell them AND the bride that they need to talk it out with each other, you are removing yourself from that narrative. \n\nThen stop worrying about it. If your sister makes a fool out of herself at the wedding that\u2019s on her boo-boo. Not your problem if everyone gossips about her and how tacky she is for wearing that color and style of dress to someone else\u2019s wedding. \n\nSince you\u2019re a bridesmaid, just make sure you glue yourself to the bride for the early part of the wedding and reception. Don\u2019t be ANYWHERE near your sister when people first see her in that dress, so it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re supporting it and cool with her choices. \n\nBut this is not your hill to die on my friend.
