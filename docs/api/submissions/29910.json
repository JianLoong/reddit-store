David is married to Denise, and on the surface me and Denise have a lot in common, as in like a lot of the same hobbies, both career driven, etc. However, Denise drives me a little crazy for a number of reasons I\u2019m not going to go into here, but suffice to say I find her to be very entitled, immature, and critical.\n\nBecause my fiance and David are good friends, at the start we all spent a lot of time together. About two years ago I told my fiance I wanted to spend way less time with Denise, but he\u2019s welcome to hang out with them on his own, which he\u2019s done since.\n\nThis last weekend we hosted a bar hopping party, and had gotten a party bus to take us around town from bar to bar. Denise decided to invite 10 of her friends, which is fine - I know and like them just didn\u2019t have their numbers for the invite. Unbeknownst to me, she felt that since she had \u201cinvited\u201d so many people that she should get a say in planning the party and was a party \u201chost\u201d. \n\nIt started with her sending me a detailed itinerary a week before of where she wanted the bus should go and when, completely ignoring all of the info already on the invite (like when the bus was leaving). Apparently she didn\u2019t read the invite at all, because a week later and her group is still the only one that hasn\u2019t paid me - something she had said was my fault because I didn\u2019t send a Venmo request to her before the party even though it was on the invite and wasn\u2019t an issue for anyone else. We had a lot of last minute additions, so called to confirm her numbers and it turns out that six of her friends had dropped out so she only had four, but she didn\u2019t think it was relevant to tell us this until we asked.\n\nWe only had the bus for three hours, and she held everyone up for >15 minutes at the start because she wasn\u2019t listening when we told everyone to start getting ready and to get on the bus, and decided that we simply *had* to bring more beer (we already had plenty), then had to pee, then didn\u2019t know where her things were, etc. We rented a bus for 35, but ended up with 38, so didn\u2019t want to draw attention to our number - something she was told multiple times. Despite this, every time we got back on after a stop she started loudly yelling for everyone to count off. By the end of the night I was pretty short with her, and had told her to \u201cquit it\u201d multiple times when she was telling people to count off. Per my fiance I was visibly annoyed with her, which I believe (I do not have a poker face). She had asked him if I was mad at her and why, and was upset by it. \n\nHe brought it up to me at the end of the night and told me I should have been nicer to her. I probably could have, but I was just so done with her behavior and don\u2019t regret how I acted. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1698592438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j513e/aita_for_not_being_nicer_to_my_fianc\u00e9s_friend/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your fianc\u00e9 is a pushover. \n\nDenise hijacked a party, invited people without asking, made herself into a party host, ignored the established itinerary, didn't pay on time, wasted everyone's time on the bus, and her extra guests put the rental over the limit.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9's inability to be empathetic to you, his fiancee, is concerning.", "NTA, also lol at the \"I do not have a poker face\". Same.\n\nIt might be a good idea to just tell her directly what you're annoyed about and why it wasn't acceptable? I'm always on the fence with this kind of advice, because it's always way easier said than done, and people like that never listen anyways. But right now all the same information is going around, just through multiple channels and second hand accounts, and that's never good. \n\nWe have a pair of friends like this - the guys are really close but the other wife is pretty unpleasant. We limit our time together to the point where we Do No Hang Out unless it's a two-couple thing I can't get out of. So I get that it can cause a difficult dynamic of the guys want to stay friends. Good luck ahah", "Ew no she definitely sounds entitled. NTA for sure. I\u2019d also be annoyed at my own finance for not hearing my feelings about a person when I had legitimate reasons not to like them.", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to our kindness. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong", "NTA. I'd be making sure I didn't invite her to anything else in the future.

Trust me my friend \u2026 it\u2019s a reasonable word & can solve a lot of problems.\n\nGet your money from Denise & do not allow this to happen again.\n\nBeing \u201cnice\u201d is a subjective statement.

If you\u2019re irritated all night, then she accomplished her goal\u2026the night was all about her.  If you can\u2019t talk to her about why her behavior annoys you, then the best thing would be to not invite her anymore.", "NTA. She sounds annoying and clueless. Being nicer would have taken a Herculean effort.\n\nTell your fianc\u00e9 that if he wants you to be more pleasant in future, he must manage her - I'm guessing he was largely oblivious to her behaviour.", "Yta if you behaved like a door mat and let her walk all over you she will.  You did.  You did nothing  to stand up for yourself.  So either learn to stand up or sit down and shut up.  Your choice.  People will treat you bad if you let them. You let her and your bf treat you bad.  So why are you complaining now?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You neee to stop hanging out with her. Your fianc\u00e9 is an adult who can have friends outside of you baby sitting his gf.", "She is a pain in the backside. Tell him she will not be invited next time and then you won't need to be nicer to her. Who invites ten people to someone else's event?\n\nNTA", "NTA, Denise is, but your fiance is also on the fine line. Denise was disrespectful to you through the entire process, from the moment she started inviting people without communicating, etc. Your fiance doesn't get to hold you accountable for responding to disrespect while ignoring where the problem is. He wants to be friends with David, let them be guy friends and do guy things, but David and Denise together aren't suitable to be couple friends, and since your fiance prioritizes David's comfort, and therefore Denise's, over you, it's 100% appropriate for *you* to have zero to do with either of them.", "NTA. It\u2019s not fair to you that you planned it and Denise hijacked it and was all over the place with communication. But I do have one question though. How did David react with everything. Did he tell Denise to stop at all?", "NTA. She hijacked your activities.", ">He brought it up to me at the end of the night and told me I should have been nicer to her.\n\nWhy? Ask him why. You don't like this person. You aren't friends. She was causing constant issues with something you planned. NTA.", "Thanks - yeah it\u2019s hard with the couple friends. David is one of my fianc\u00e9s best friends and the few times I\u2019ve gotten more honest with Denise about her behavior or acted against what she\u2019s wanted it\u2019s created so much drama, so I just don\u2019t know how to address it without blowing up my fianc\u00e9s and David\u2019s relationship. Limiting our time seems to be the best move for right now. I\u2019m kinda hoping they\u2019ll grow out of the friendship as well as our lives are moving in two separate directions.", "He\u2019s heard them and made adjustments - it\u2019s why we don\u2019t spend much time with them anymore, it\u2019s like two events a year. His ask is more that when we do interact that I\u2019m polite to her, which I usually do fine with and did drop the ball on it this time.", "lol I\u2019ve used it with her multiple times and did this time as well with most of these things. In the past, just like this time, the word \u201cNo\u201d leads to her causing some drama because she didn\u2019t get exactly what she wanted \ud83d\ude44", "Oh no, he is a doormat if ever there was one", "NTA tell David  that if Denise  wants to host a party she needs to organize her own not to try piggy back on yours. \n\nLet him deal with her", "Totally fair! Thats good to hear! But you\u2019re also human and she sounded entitled and difficult during this event. I don\u2019t blame you for being annoyed", "She was ruining everything and your A-H fiance was more focused on HER feelings than YOURS.\n\nNTA but maybe rethink how much he puts you behind others and how often he ignores your feelings and tells you to suck it up.", "You were and no you didn't drop the ball at all, she was overstepping and trying to take over your event. You can only be polite so long before becoming a doormat.  Jfc\n\nTll your fiance you will be polite as long as she is and doesn't try to walk all over you. The second she does you will treat her as she deserves.", "That\u2019s a Denise problem not your problem. Don\u2019t lose any sleep over that nonsense. \n\nI also do not hide my feelings well. Passive aggressive doesn\u2019t work for me. Or at all imo. I speak up before I lose my shit. \n\nSay what you need to say as politely as possible. Then tell others what they can expect from you. \u201cYour behavior is not okay if you continue to behave like you\u2019re the only person on this bus, I will ask the driver to stop & you will be getting off. The choice is yours. Either play nice with everyone or go on your own merry way. Those are the only options available\u201d\n\nPeople who rock the boat & create the problems are the people who deserve be told to sit the hell down, shut up or gtfo.", "Time to stop inviting her at all then if the only thing she does is ruining the mood", "Maybe tell your fiance to grow a spine", "She co-opted your party. Nta", "You should yeet that fiance like you should have yeeted Denise off the bus.\n\nSeriously though, you need to show this post to your fiance, and have a long hard think and a talk about this situation. Do you truly want your life to be like this? You want to marry this man?\n\nEither way, good luck. And NTA.", "NTA, but you agreed to everything. Despite whatever she did, you had every oppurtunity to change the dynamic.", "NTA she suuuuuuuucks", "NTA why does your fiance think you should have been nicer to a person who derailed a very thoroughly planned party you were hosting? I'd just hash it out with Denise and tell her why her behavior was inappropriate.", "TEN people at that!! Only 4 showed, but still, I wouldn\u2019t dream of inviting 2 extra people without asking, much less TEN!", "That\u2019s actually not true. I agreed to the extra people and that was it because we know and like them. Everything else I told her to stop doing and that it wasn\u2019t appropriate.", "I think you should just stick to the boundary you already set. Your fianc\u00e9 can hang out with David on his own. If Denise is there too, it doesn't mean you have to be.", "He needs to ask her to be polite to you.", "If he wants you to be polite while someone who's rude and overbearing tramples you, I'd suggest to him that he can get Denise to back off on hijacking events *you* organize, she can organize events, or you want zero events a year with Denise.", "Sounds like drama happened anyway. If there's gonna be drama anyway, free yourself from caring about that and say no whenever you want to.", "Everyone is responsible for their own actions, you know who this person is and you let it happen, you could have said no.", "Like I just clarified - I did. If you read my original post then you would know that the reason I\u2019m asking if IATA is because I told her no multiple times and it was not well received.", "You need a new partner. Nta.", "NTA. I don't know Denise and I hate her.", "NTA.  No. More. Contact. With. Denise. For.  You.", "I just have 1 question how do you know 37 people you like enough to go out on the town with? \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nI don't like people that much. NTA though. Your party, your plan.", "NTA. Nicer to her? Hell, if that was me, I'd have left her ignorant, entitled ass behind when she didn't show up on time. The first time she started yelling for people to count off she'd have been left on the curb. You were way nicer than you needed to be. Tell your fianc\u00e9 to take a good look at her before he opens his mouth.", "lol - I do not, I\u2019m with you and can fit the number of people I know, like, and will willingly spend hours hanging out with on one hand. But my finace is the quintessential golden retriever boyfriend who collects new friends like they\u2019re Pok\u00e9mon and he \u201cgotta catch \u2018em all\u201d", "It may be time to add, \"I'm not in charge of planning/hosting anything she's involved in.\" \n\nIf you decide to do an event like this again, either she's not involved or you turn over planning/wrangling her to your SO. Let HIM handle all of that on his own. He'll either still be nice at the end of the night, having wasted time/money or he'll be increasingly short with her, depending on his personality. \n\nEither way, make it so it's not your problem. Have you phone and chill while you wait for them to get their act together.", "Omg I feel you're pain. Lol", "The extra 10 people alone was enough to be very annoyed with Denise, let alone any of the other things she did.", "So I tried this last year because this party is an annual thing we usually plan and I didn\u2019t feel like dealing with all the logistics. Told everyone I wasn\u2019t going to do it, so my SO and Denise decided they\u2019d plan it together. In short - \n\n1. Bus was ordered last minute so it was way more expensive than it had been in the past\n2. Because everything was so last minute, most of the people we invited couldn\u2019t make it, and Denise stuck my SO with the bill for >1/2 the bus\n3. Denise was in charge of coordinating dinner and dropped the ball, so everyone who did show up blacked out and I ended up herding cats to get them all back to my house for food and water at the end of the night \n4. Denise dipped after the last bar to go get food *for just herself* and we had to wait on the bus for >20 minutes for her to get back because David wouldn\u2019t leave without her\n\nThere\u2019s more, but it was bad enough that this year I just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and decided to do it all myself. People enjoy it a lot and usually I have a good time too. Denise wasn\u2019t supposed to have been involved at all. And after the shit she pulled this year and last, I\u2019m done inviting her to parties."]}
