Also, if you have family (like parents) that want to watch baby on a regular basis, it would be nice to leave that playpen with them if they are okay with that.

Wonderful who doesn't want to find a bottle of purifying milk in the playpen when they go to break it down and stow it away for the future?\n\nYour MIL, like myself, has already gone through the baby raising process. We bought the bells and whistles and they backfired so hard they knocked us into the next county. She's trying to save you.

That way, if you run out of diapers, you have some you can use. (Also, there's no guarantee your little one's bum won't be sensitive. Mine were allergic and I just had to use cloth all the time. Don't worry, they snap shut. It's really just like disposable but you wash them instead of throwing them away. )", "YTA for asking them to return it when you can return it yourself. Hell, you can even say that you received multiple as the reason you returned the one they purchased should it ever come up. \n\nWhere I do agree with you is that if someone goes through the trouble of telling you exactly what they want, you should get them what they asked for instead of going with a different gift in the same style.", "YTA Having been pregnant I know it can be frustrating when someone gifts you something that you may not want or be able to use. I mean someone gifted me a bowling set for my baby (why? No idea.) Gratitude and being kind go along way though. Gifts are never required nor should they be expected when having a baby.

You'll have to warm the bottle anyway before feeding the baby - may as well just grab one from the kitchen. Music and vibration features? Baby might hate it. My advice is to wait until the baby actually arrives and starts using the playpen before you decide what to do. Another thought: you could end up benefiting from an extra playpen. If you plan to spend a lot of time elsewhere - say, at your mom's place - it'll be way easier to have certain things there (playpen, bouncy chair, diaper changing supplies) instead of schlepping them back and forth.\n\nIn terms of a judgment, it's tacky AF to return a gift and ask for a more expensive one instead.

But I can assure you I would have exchanged it if it had been the main one on my baby shower list, as it was awful looking with a terrible color scheme that hurt my eyes.**", "I mean her complaint is about multiple things but I mean is this really AITA if we don\u2019t just cherry pick the parts the make us the most the angry?", "That's what got me the no effort part.", "Oh, they give a shit... all over everything!", "My mom got my newest a vibrating bouncer seat. He hated it. Every time we tried it, he\u2019d freak out. He was happier sleeping on my chest. Now, he is almost 7 months and in 12 month clothes so sleeping on my chest isn\u2019t as comfy for me.", "Whoa, I didn't know they were sturdy enough for that, but I guess that's good! Until your comment, I thought people were leaning over the walls, all the way down into the playpen to change baby on the floor.", "They\u2019re saying \u201cungrateful hormones\u201d because OP has the spine to think that telling her in laws to return an item and buy her the one she wants is remotely okay. \n\nIt\u2019s totally fine to return a gift. Demanding that someone return it and spend an extra $30-$80 on you is ungrateful. I believe the commenter was trying to say that anyone who has that kind of audacity must be really really flooded with hormones at best (or a major AH at worst).", "For you. My play pen serves as a changing table and napping station on the first floor of my home as her room is on the second floor. Gift giving 101- don\u2019t cheap out when someone requests a specific gift. (The gift givers here asked what she wanted then didn\u2019t get the specific one she picked out- that makes them AHs.). If you don\u2019t want to spend the full amount buy something else completely or give a gift card.\n\nLuckily for OP Target will take returns on baby stuff without a receipt.", "Pack n plays in the US are sleep rated and lots of people use them as a crib. Many also come with built in changing tables. For some families a pack n play serves as a basinet, crib, changing table, and playpen so it\u2019s important to have exactly the one you want.", "Sleeping is absolutely fine in a playpen. Most have a bassinet level and a play level. My daughter slept in hers until she got too tall.", "I told people if they insisted on gifts for baby for Christmas, to get books. Never have too many", "How is that lack of manners on her part though? Its fairly common to return items that were not on the registry for ones that were. And I don't know many people that contact the person to let them know they returned the gift which seems much ruder.\n\nIts nice that you took the time to research before buying but your sister in law probably did the same and found the one that would fit her needs. A gift card is the answer if you can't stick to the registry.", "is there any way you would\u2019ve preferred she approached you about it? mainly asking for OP and my own reference", "I understand where you are coming from, but your SIL is the one that has to use it, not you. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t appreciate the gift, it just means that she had different preferences as the daily user. \n\nTo put the shoe on the other foot- your SIL probably extensively researched the items she wanted and felt the same as you when she opened your present and it wasn\u2019t what she had asked for.", "It was VERY thoughtful of you to take the amount of effort you did to get that gift for your brother and SIL. That being said, parents go through a boatload picking out very specific products for their kids. They likely did way more than two hours of research. There was probably a reason she wanted the one that was double the price. \n\nYou chose to get something off registry. Just because you thought it was good enough, you still went off script. Giving people what you think is good enough isn't as thoughtful as you think it is. \n\nShe didn't lack manners and it wasn't underhanded. In fact, it was a kindness that she received it so well. \n\nCan you tell me the thoughtful way to tell someone that you appreciate the effort, but you want to have the thing you explicitly communicated you wanted, and not someone else's choice?", "Gifts aren\u2019t about the gifter, they are about the receiver. \n\nYour SIL probably spent much more time than you researching the exact item she wanted to use in a daily basis with her baby. It\u2019s like someone else picking out your couch for you when you already knew the one you wanted. \n\nI totally understand not having the money to buy a $350 baby swing and a $180 gift is very generous. But you shouldn\u2019t be upset she didn\u2019t want to use the particular item you got. She got the item that fit their life best and probably used the money you spent to get it. Your nephew got a baby swing, and that\u2019s what matters.", "Don\u2019t take it to heart. When you\u2019re a first time mom, the things you choose for your child is very specific and took hours upon hours of research and comparison. She didn\u2019t do it out of maliciousness but it is just not the specific one that she had been researching.", "Why does she have a lack of manners?\n\nShe graciously accepted the gift publicly and then exchanged it privately. That's what she was supposed to do.", "Honestly, it goes both ways. I'm also a person who struggles to give good gifts and finds it hurtful when someone doesn't seem appreciate the effort I've put in or doesn't respond in the way I might have hoped.\n\nAt the same time, *this is up to you to manage.* It's not a gift if it comes with strings attached\u2014 you can't make up a contract in your mind about this and then be upset that the recipient didn't hold up their end. I find the most productive way forward is simply to focus my genuine gift-giving energy on those who I am confident get me and will be happy with the items I invest effort in picking out for them, and for other people, just grab whatever off their list; everyone wins this way.", "Its not rude to return a gift you dont like.", "She probably did that because she knew you couldn\u2019t get her the one she wanted and didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. It\u2019s great that you got the best one you could but if it were me I would rather you had gotten me something else entirely than just a less expensive variation of what I really did want. But if I knew you couldn\u2019t afford the $350 baby swing I would have told you to get something else in the first place", "Ugh this kind of annoys me.  You lament at all the time you spent researching and how she didn\u2019t appreciate it, but are failing to account for all the time she spent researching baby products and carefully selecting what she wanted.  \n\nI don\u2019t understand why people ignore registries.  In our busy lives, it\u2019s literally the best thing ever. You can click button order, have it shipped to their house AND assure that it\u2019s exactly what the recipient wants!  And if you can\u2019t afford it a gift card works just as well with maybe a smaller personalized gift for the baby.  \n\nI had a crib and bedding on my registry. My bf\u2019s parents went and bought a crib that was NOT on my registry.  My coworkers ended up buying the one I selected as it was still available.  So now I had two cribs and two bedding sets and had to go and tell his parents that we were returning theirs because it\u2019s not the one I picked.  It was super uncomfortable for me.  And their feelings were hurt, but the crib they got wouldn\u2019t have fit in my daughter\u2019s tiny room.  I carefully selected the furniture based on dimensions so that all pieces could fit.   A lot of times it\u2019s just preference, but sometimes there\u2019s reasons behind it as well.", "I don\u2019t see a lack of manners? I understand being disappointed, but she didn\u2019t do anything rude or wrong. It\u2019s a total toss-up whether or not someone would want to be told that the gift recipient swapped it out and it makes more sense for your brother to be the one to say something anyway since he\u2019s your sibling.", "But it's not rude at all for the recipient to do what they want with a gift. There's no rule that says the recipient must have the gift you gave and no other option. It's actually a credit to your SIL that she didn't bring it up. Your purchase still helped them get the item that worked best for them. Your gift IS appreciated.", "This is a weird take. \n\nI put HOURS of research and tears into my registry and people got me multiples of the same thing that wasn't even on the registry. Give gifts people need and want, not what you think is best, especially when it comes to babies and things that are meaningful or useful to the giftee.", "I\u2019m sorry but she actually spared your feelings that\u2019s so silly - she sounded like she was polite and gracious and then did everything she could to be kind. You acting like it\u2019s aa slight is the rude part", "The gift wasn\u2019t about you tho, it\u2019s about the person you a getting it for. You couldn\u2019t afford the gift they wanted or needed - you could have always bought a gift card. You can\u2019t expect people to receive a gift and still use it if it\u2019s not what they need and want.", "Lies require more lies to maintain and it always eventually collapses.  Never lie.  You don't ever have to tell every aspect of the truth, but what you do share should be true.\n\nThat's just a general rule for a successful life.", "My son used to like to sleep in the laundry basket!", "Many pack n plays have two inserts for newborns. We had a changing table and a higher sleep area so I didn\u2019t have to bend completely.", "That is not what the Artistic Leader said. Had it been, I would have agreed.", "My parents had a playpen for when my nephew was over. It also had the the changing table area and a place to store items but it wasn\u2019t really that fancy/elaborate.  It wasn\u2019t huge and could fit in the foyer and if you didn\u2019t use the front door it was the perfect tiny room while they\u2019d be at the house, and you could also roll it into the middle of the living room. Having the extra features was nice for their visits because my parents only needed the one item for multiple things.  \n\nWho knows, maybe OPs in laws bought it to keep at their house.  Probably not but it\u2019s a possibility.", "Yeah, I feel like this is a \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d kind of situation.", "Honestly if you can\u2019t afford something on a registry or something, either in cash or a universal gift card just contribute as much money as you feel comfortable giving or what you can afford to give and be honest. Yes it\u2019s the thought that counts but realistically it\u2019s better to just give an \u201cunthoughtful\u201d gift they\u2019ll actually use than waste both your time getting them something they don\u2019t want and disappointing everyone involved.", "Imagine putting a $350 baby swing on your gift registry though. If I wanted kids, I'd never expect someone to spend nearly $500 on them.", "See, this is why I don't give gifts to people.  I could spend two minutes looking on Amazon, which is a lot of time out of my day, for a toy truck for some kid my uncle had and they don't like it because it's not the one they asked for.  \n\nLike y'all think I have time for this?\n\nYes...i'm serious...i'm that guy, but this is sarcasm.", "Or just get a $180 gift card and a note that says \u201cto put toward your dream swing\u201d or whatever. Would have taken 5 min and everyone wins.", "I get wanting to get something, anything, but when it comes to babies, especially first babies, parents want specific things for their precious ones. It is the thought that counts, unless you're replacing something they specifically wanted with something else that might not have the features they want.\n\nDon't get me wrong, $350 is crazy expensive, but I get it. My wife asked for a stand mixer, a very specific one with features she wanted. Someone got her a cheap version that can't actually do what she wanted it for, so it's been sitting in a box because we don't have a gift receipt.\n\nUltimately, that should be the real lesson. It's the thought that counts, not the item. But it goes both ways. Provide receipts and understand that the receiver has every right to substitute if something isn't right.", "Exactly. Say it again\u2026gifts aren\u2019t about the gifter, they are about the receiver.", ">Gifts aren\u2019t about the gifter, they are about the receiver. \n\nThis! I had an argument with someone recently about whether a friend I was concerned about had an obligation to tell me she was okay or if it was rude to not tell me she was. \n\nWe really need to be more ready to ask ourself what our intentions are and what our expectations are and if they align", "A wishing list is not a shopping list. that is the first thing you are taught aound Christmas time when you are 4 years old.", "Sometimes, the website/company will send a discount code for the remaining items on the list. It does suck if it was like the last item left for those picking up gifts last minute.", "It\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t intend on anyone getting it for her but added it to the list as it\u2019ll be easier for her to find it when she actually needs to buy it. There\u2019s no reason for her to create a separate list as a) she\u2019ll get a discount for the item later and b) it\u2019s her list.", "A lot of people will go in together on those bigger gifts. You're supposed to put what you'd want and need in there. You're allowed to be picky when it comes to your children's safety.", "The cheapest item on her registry was a $50 baby wipe warmer.\n\nThe average for gifts was like $200.\n\nThe most expensive item was $550.\n\nShe comes from money and has no concept of how expensive these things are.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with putting a $350 item on your registry. Some people DO want to spend that much money on a gift, some people don\u2019t. Generally baby registries have a wide variety of items in a wide variety of prices. If $350 is above your budget there are almost always other things on the registry that cost much less. If no one wants to buy the $350 item that\u2019s ok. I would never judge someone for putting an expensive item on their registry. I have seen registries with items that cost much more, but also include items that cost $20. People just buy what\u2019s in their budget, it\u2019s not some crazy concept", "Most baby registries have the option to split gifts over a certain price point. I would never expect someone to buy me a $250 car seat, but I\u2019m super appreciative that a friend and six different coworkers contributed what they could and we got exactly what we wanted.", "> but when it comes to babies, especially first babies, parents want specific things for their precious ones\n\nWith my first my (childless) sister decided she knew better and disregarded my registry and bought what she *knew* was better. It's irrational but I've spent the better part of 8 years annoyed by that. \n\nWe recently had our 2nd and I just said no registry we'll buy everything ourselves and when questioned I told her why. She's still childless, still an amazing aunt but still doesn't get it", "People gift so much crap to new parents and people getting married that it's completely acceptable to return items. There's a reason registries exist, it's to make sure gifts that are given are actually useful to the person getting them.\nIt's completely fair to not spend $350 on a swing, but if you go out and buy something not on the list, you shouldn't be offended that it's returned.", "A registry is not the same as a child's Christmas wish list. These are things people have picked out to fit their home, their space and lifestyle.\n\nThere is a reason people put these together and reasons people buy off of them, because it makes things so much easier", "It\u2019s not a letter to Santa. A registry pretty much *is* a shopping list for friends and family. Most are online now and have links and everything for this exact reason.", "Except a gift registry is a shopping list. That's why people make them. So people buying gifts know what the reciepiant wants. Wedding and baby registries are functional and practical items, not whims like Christmas.", "I feel a wish list for a baby's shower is a little bit different than a wish list for a Christmas gift. And when it comes to big ticket items, You get what the person wants, if you can't afford it then you say hey I can't afford the whole thing but here's what I can afford to put towards it.", "A 4 year olds wish list isn\u2019t going to have an effect on the safety of your child, the convenience of pockets/storage/ease of use or breakdown/setting up, or storage space like baby furniture and necessities will. If a 4 year old asks for an American girl doll, and gets Pleasant Company (a knock off, I googled it) then it\u2019s not the end of the world and they might not even notice the difference. \n\nThe difference 200 dollars could make on a baby swing however might be huge. It could be safer, easier to store, have more things to keep the baby entertained, it could have other features the mom finds necessary and tons of other reasons. It\u2019s like buying a cheap stroller three times or an expensive one once. We have no idea why she preferred that baby swing and it could\u2019ve been aesthetics which you could argue is being spoiled but imo it\u2019s totally valid to want to keep a certain look or feel to something you\u2019re gonna see literally every day, or it could be a product rated number one for safety, never had a recall, with easy collapsibility to store in the closet out of use that they\u2019ll be able to sell or happily give away when the baby grows out of it.", "A registry is literally a shopping list lmao.\n\nIt is items the parents wanted, researched, and felt worked best for them. You don't know the situation. The parents may have picked certain things because they don't have room for others or this or that.\n\nNot sure your point about Christmas is valid, either. In my family we send the specific product we want because people have specific needs and desires and no, I don't have anywhere to put that thing I didn't ask for.", "I think you can get a safe baby swing for cheaper than $350.", "Right, on mine anything $100+ had a contribution option or buy straight out.", "Yes, I see this is something you can do now and it is a wonderful option. I had a friend at church I had not seen in a while thank me for the changing table/dresser for a second I was like.. what is she talking about lol. I had gone in on paying for it several months previous and she sent me a thank you note too. I just had forgotten easily because I didn't buy/ wrap it so it wasn't as big of a memory.

It\u2019s a bunch of stuff people want others to buy for them, if they\u2019re *those* kinds of people, and it\u2019s a bunch of gift ideas if they\u2019re not. Yes, there are plenty of grifters (ha! Autocorrected from giftees but I\u2019m leaving it) that will go outside of their personal budget when choosing items because they have friends and family who can afford that price range. Normal people will put one or two big things, knowing that some people like to go in together on a gift, like all the aunties, or mom\u2019s bunco club.", "Not true. Yes most are practical however a$350 baby swing? That screams of someone who wanted the most expensive thing they could find because they feel entitled to have that kind of money dropped on their kid. SMH. People are using these lists as if all their friends and family have won the lottery and have that kind of disposable cash. It is ridiculous.", "Most places give you a discount on items not purchased. We put items that were expensive on ours, not expecting anyone to buy them, but to get 20% off for ourselves. \n\nAlso, different income brackets allow for different budgets. My kids will likely always have something that costs more than a similar item. Not because we\u2019re rich, but because it\u2019s something we can afford or have saved for.\n\nEdit to add: NTA. A gift is a gift. You\u2019re not responsible for someone attaching their emotions to something they are freely giving away. Graciously accept the gift and then return it for the one that you want; paying the difference yourself.", "That's not the point I was making.\n\nThis is about someone choosing what they prefer for themselves and their family on their registry.

But until it's your kid, you don't get to dictate which baby swing a mother uses for *her* child.", "Yeah, my mom and dad and I went in on a baby swing for my niece and found a really good one on sale for like $150. It's not like a more inexpensive swing is suddenly going to burst into flames and start beating the baby with its own metal rods.", "I agree that there can be unreasonable items on registries and entitled people abuse it. But the point is that it IS a shopping list. So you shouldn't be surprised if you get a cheaper version, and they return it to put that money toward the one they wanted and pay the difference. My wife and I put a tv on our wedding registry. Didn't feel entitled to it. Just a shot in the dark. And we didn't get it. If you can't afford something on a baby registry, get a box of diapers."]}
