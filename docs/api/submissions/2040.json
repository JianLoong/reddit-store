This way at holiday events and get togethers you can get use out of it while saving time breaking down and setting up the playpen you prefer at home. Just grab it and go. Also, if you have family (like parents) that want to watch baby on a regular basis, it would be nice to leave that playpen with them if they are okay with that. Anything that saves you time setting up and breaking down baby related equipment will be appreciated once baby arrives. Then, buy the one you prefer outright and use it as your primary playpen. That's the route I would take.", "NTA. They asked you what you wanted and you sent them a link. They ignored the one you wanted and honestly spent a ridiculously low amount on a playpen.

Those pockets are called \"clutter collectors\" and soon you won't be able to find things you need because you'll have to many similar places to stash them. You can keep bottles there? Wonderful who doesn't want to find a bottle of purifying milk in the playpen when they go to break it down and stow it away for the future?\n\nYour MIL, like myself, has already gone through the baby raising process. We bought the bells and whistles and they backfired so hard they knocked us into the next county. She's trying to save you. Learn from us.\n\nInstead, buy a baby mat with vibration and music to put in your playpen for when your baby is newborn (the only age that kid will use the feature) get yourself a diaper bag with a good changing mat so you can change your kid anywhere and pick the floor when you're home  because the kid can't roll off the floor while you're reaching for diaper cream.  \n\nAbout pampers: if you really want your family to throw you a lifesaver, ask for some cloth diapers and wraps since there are supply chain issues. That way, if you run out of diapers, you have some you can use. (Also, there's no guarantee your little one's bum won't be sensitive. Mine were allergic and I just had to use cloth all the time. Don't worry, they snap shut. It's really just like disposable but you wash them instead of throwing them away. )", "YTA for asking them to return it when you can return it yourself. Hell, you can even say that you received multiple as the reason you returned the one they purchased should it ever come up. \n\nWhere I do agree with you is that if someone goes through the trouble of telling you exactly what they want, you should get them what they asked for instead of going with a different gift in the same style.", "YTA Having been pregnant I know it can be frustrating when someone gifts you something that you may not want or be able to use. I mean someone gifted me a bowling set for my baby (why? No idea.) Gratitude and being kind go along way though. Gifts are never required nor should they be expected when having a baby.

You'll have to warm the bottle anyway before feeding the baby - may as well just grab one from the kitchen. Music and vibration features? Baby might hate it. My advice is to wait until the baby actually arrives and starts using the playpen before you decide what to do. Another thought: you could end up benefiting from an extra playpen. If you plan to spend a lot of time elsewhere - say, at your mom's place - it'll be way easier to have certain things there (playpen, bouncy chair, diaper changing supplies) instead of schlepping them back and forth.\n\nIn terms of a judgment, it's tacky AF to return a gift and ask for a more expensive one instead.

Then everyone is happy and it avoids conflict.", "This is the easiest solution but still may lead to hurt feelings when the grandparents come over and see the baby in a different playpen than the one they bought. But agree OP WBTA if she asks them to return.", "This. The proper etiquette is to return the gift yourself, quietly, after you e received it and written a thank you card.", "Your answer has restored my faith in humanity!", "What? There are 100s of playpens. And most will be used for 3-4 years unless they have more children then multiple that. \n\nOP go get what you want. Just do not tell them to return it.

Good luck with your kid!", "Maybe focus on: smaller space for baby which isn't good and no outer pockets which are more functional...", "Exactly this, there\u2019s way more nuance to this. What\u2019s the relationship like with ILs? Because surely returning it and then getting the one you want is going to be more awkward in the long run if you\u2019re not honest, because they\u2019re IN-LAWS, chances are they\u2019re going to see their gift not in use and a different one instead?", "I always give a gift card and a small stuffed animal or something. I didn't use half the stuff I got.", "Agreed! Maybe she could return it herself. It so not polite to give the gift back. I HATE babyshowers, LOL.", "It's not double the amount, she said it's on sale for $125.", "Baby cage. Love it!", "Many family and friends like to help buy things for babies. IF they ASK, it's not wrong to tell them what you'd like. OP can either return this playpen and buy her own, maybe even just buy what she wants and use this one at the grandparents.", "She probably can buy herself things, but from personal experience, even if you don\u2019t have a registry or don\u2019t have an formal celebration, people will want to buy you thing for events like marriages and babies. \n\nSo having a registry makes it easier on people and makes it more likely that you will get the things you need/want. \n\nI do agree that she should just return it and get the one she wants.", "Yeah. You don\u2019t need a play pen from the day baby is born", "Because she\u2019s pregnant and everyone should buy everything for her", "Eh you can't be grateful and still decide you want/need a different one. \n\nOP isn't asking inlaws to buy the more expensive version, OP just wants to return it and pay the difference themselves. \n\nInlaws offered/asked what OP needed/wanted and OP sent them a link to exactly what she wanted. Likely OP was willing/ready to spend the $125 on the pack n play they wanted. But inlaws said they would get it. \n\nI would be on inlaws side if OP had just said \"pack n play\" and not given anything specific. If inlaws realized $125 was more than they could/wanted to spend they should have gotten a gift card for $90 saying to help with the pack n play. \n\nI think gifting has two factors, it is partially the thought that counts, but also it should be something the person receiving it actually wants/needs. \n\nI think it's NAH. It is understandable if inlaws can't spend $125, but it is also understandable for OP to return it and get the one they want.", "The question is would they be TA for asking the other person to return it and buy the one they wanted instead. It seems like you answered a different question\n\nI agree they\u2019re allowed to want what they want. But the method they want to go about it makes them TA.", "I know this whole sub is about passing judgement on people, but really... questioning her abilities as a mother because she wants a different play pen?

It's annoying and inconvenient when people don't get what you want especially when you have a list saying what you want.", "I don\u2019t it\u2019s bad that she wants to return it and get the version she wants. Most comments are mad that she wants them to return and then they buy the more expensive one. I\u2019d vote N T A if she would ask for the receipt, return that one and pay the difference to get what she wants but asking for them to pay for a better version is a little entitled.", "Honestly idk why this isn\u2019t more popular. Sure her issue about the color is stupid, it\u2019s a baby that can\u2019t even tell what color that is, but there is a reason why people pick out the specific things they do after a bunch of research. I\u2019m not a mom, but same crap happens to me when family asks what I want and then get the cheap version of something. Now I just ask for money or wool socks.", "Then she should buy her own gifts and not expect other people to fund her nursery.

I wouldn't pay more for those kind of features ever again.", "If in-laws notice you don\u2019t have it, you can always say somebody else purchased you that one.  With 2 pack n plays you merely chose the one you thought would get more use.  Or keep both, we had multiple friends with kids and would keep an extra around for friends babies to nap in and use. \n\nPretty much everyone gets duplicates or some items they actually don\u2019t like at a baby shower.   Graciously thank the giver, write a thank you card.  Then return any items you do not intend to use ON YOUR OWN.  \n\nThis way you can get what you will actually use and the gift giver feel properly appreciated. It is most important for your guests to feel appreciated for taking the time and expense to think of you at the this time.\n\nEdit: forgot to add. YTA, or would be if you asked the gift giver to exchange the item for you.", "She can simply tell her in-laws that although she appreciates their gift it's not the one she had requested so she returned it for the one she wanted. That way, if anything, the in-laws look like assholes for not listening to what she asked for. If you're going to ask someone for what they want and they go to the trouble to tell you the specific one, it's kind of a dick move to get the wrong one.\n\nI do agree that for the short time the kid uses the playpen it may not be worth spending extra money on something that will be obsolete in a short period of time. Assuming they don't plan on having more kids anytime soon.", "It sounds like while op likes the bells and whistles on the one she chose, her issue with the one her ils got her is that it has less storage and not as good of reviews. We don\u2019t know op\u2019s living issues so storage might be a problem for her and she needs the storage on the other pack n play. As a mom of 5 I understand how extra storage can be like gold and I also understand wanting products that have good ratings.

Where I used to work, we'd allow returns without the receipt, they'd just have to accept store credit instead of the refund being cash or going back on their card.", "i think its common to include a gift receipt. it doesn\u2019t show the price on it, but it can be used to get a refund or to exchange.", "If this was me, and I wasn\u2019t able to return or exchange it, I would either suck it up and use the one they gave me or I would just give it away and buy myself the one I wanted. I don\u2019t blame OP for wanting the specific item, but I was raised to believe that it\u2019s rude to complain about a gift someone gave me.", "Generally not where I live which is why it is usually ok to ask the giver for the receipt.", "Ok but she can pay the difference", "It absolutely is!

That sounds kinda gross to me.\n\nGranted, by baby #4 my standards had slipped a bit. You know, wipe off the dropped pacifier instead of re-sterilization, change the kid on a towel on the floor instead of going to the changing table, but changing a poopy diaper in the playpen? Just no.", "It\u2019s not that big of a deal. When you have little children your life is taken over by tools needed to raise those children, and when the baby is crying so much that your sleep deprived brain is glitching, you need easy access to such tools. If the vibration feature will quiet down a screaming baby for a few minutes, you *very much take it.*\n\nWith newborns in larger spaces, you also tend to get duplicate things for upstairs/downstairs or bedroom/living room, so you don\u2019t have to be running down at 3 am looking for something. And it would be nice to have a convenient place to store the duplicates.\n\nOP is N T A for wanting a specific item, and the reasons are valid. Those features are, indeed, life savers for new parents.

In the future if you can\u2019t afford what\u2019s left on the registry, give a gift card. They\u2019re always appreciated.

And, the registry was there for a reason. So that people wouldn\u2019t gift them what they didn\u2019t choose. \n\nI think it\u2019s never a good move to go off-registry when there is a registry. You can always choose more less pricey items from it or a gift card towards the bigger item. \n\nAnd common courtesy dictates that a gift receiver should *not* tell the giver they did not like the gift and returned it, because that would be rude.
