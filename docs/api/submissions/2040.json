With it being smaller and having less features, maybe you could use it for travel? You could leave it packed up and ready for transit so your main playpen could stay set up at home. This way at holiday events and get togethers you can get use out of it while saving time breaking down and setting up the playpen you prefer at home. Just grab it and go. Also, if you have family (like parents) that want to watch baby on a regular basis, it would be nice to leave that playpen with them if they are okay with that. Anything that saves you time setting up and breaking down baby related equipment will be appreciated once baby arrives. Then, buy the one you prefer outright and use it as your primary playpen. That's the route I would take.", "NTA. They asked you what you wanted and you sent them a link. They ignored the one you wanted and honestly spent a ridiculously low amount on a playpen.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting something for your baby that is specific in design or color. I would talk to them and say that this is one won\u2019t work and maybe they could return it and get you a gift card. The r/mommit sub talks about this all the time. Why ask if you\u2019re not actually going to listen to what someone wants?", "YWBTA \n\nI guarantee that features you like (music and vibration) will be outgrown long before your child outgrows the use of the playpen (and may even wear out on subsequent children, if you have any.) Those pockets are called \"clutter collectors\" and soon you won't be able to find things you need because you'll have to many similar places to stash them. You can keep bottles there? Wonderful who doesn't want to find a bottle of purifying milk in the playpen when they go to break it down and stow it away for the future?\n\nYour MIL, like myself, has already gone through the baby raising process. We bought the bells and whistles and they backfired so hard they knocked us into the next county. She's trying to save you. Learn from us.\n\nInstead, buy a baby mat with vibration and music to put in your playpen for when your baby is newborn (the only age that kid will use the feature) get yourself a diaper bag with a good changing mat so you can change your kid anywhere and pick the floor when you're home  because the kid can't roll off the floor while you're reaching for diaper cream.  \n\nAbout pampers: if you really want your family to throw you a lifesaver, ask for some cloth diapers and wraps since there are supply chain issues. That way, if you run out of diapers, you have some you can use. (Also, there's no guarantee your little one's bum won't be sensitive. Mine were allergic and I just had to use cloth all the time. Don't worry, they snap shut. It's really just like disposable but you wash them instead of throwing them away. )", "YTA for asking them to return it when you can return it yourself. Hell, you can even say that you received multiple as the reason you returned the one they purchased should it ever come up. \n\nWhere I do agree with you is that if someone goes through the trouble of telling you exactly what they want, you should get them what they asked for instead of going with a different gift in the same style.", "YTA Having been pregnant I know it can be frustrating when someone gifts you something that you may not want or be able to use. I mean someone gifted me a bowling set for my baby (why? No idea.) Gratitude and being kind go along way though. Gifts are never required nor should they be expected when having a baby. That being said I\u2019ve always bought the more expensive things that I specifically want for baby to ensure that I get it. Then I\u2019m just grateful for anything anyone has thought of. \n\nYou return the gift yourself, have the balance loaded onto a store credit card and get what you need. Telling them to return it is rude.", "That sounds like a great playpen to travel with when you go to peoples houses since it\u2019s a little smaller.

You'll have to warm the bottle anyway before feeding the baby - may as well just grab one from the kitchen. Music and vibration features? Baby might hate it. My advice is to wait until the baby actually arrives and starts using the playpen before you decide what to do. Another thought: you could end up benefiting from an extra playpen. If you plan to spend a lot of time elsewhere - say, at your mom's place - it'll be way easier to have certain things there (playpen, bouncy chair, diaper changing supplies) instead of schlepping them back and forth.\n\nIn terms of a judgment, it's tacky AF to return a gift and ask for a more expensive one instead.
