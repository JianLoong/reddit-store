Lisa mentioned how her roommate from school would be naked and apparently talk about her sex life with her mom back whenever she was home for break, and how \"gross\" that was. I honestly got a bit too defensive, but I told Lisa that there's nothing weird about that because it's just family, and I just got really blunt and mentioned that I've also been casually naked around both my parents many times, and I've even seen them naked on a few occasions. I don't think there's anything fucked up about it, that's just my family. \n\nLisa laughed and joked that I was a \"psychopath\" for doing that. Marty wasn't saying a word, but I got too pissed and said \"There's nothing weird about my own dynamic with my family. What IS fucking weird is you judgin' other people for that.\" Lisa got upset and said that it was just a joke and that I was being too damn sensitive, but when Marty drove us both home, we didn't say a word to each other. Marty said he personally wasn't judging and that Lisa didn't need to say that. But I texted Lisa asking if we could talk last night, and she still hasn't texted me back. It's making me feel like I overreacted, and I honestly didn't see her perspective enough on the naked thing, because I guess it's not the norm to be exposed to your parents like that. AITA?

Social norms about nudity between family members vary throughout different cultures. Your family simply has a different view than your friends. As long as no abuse is going on, then it really is just between family what you do in your own house.", "NTA.  Lisa\u2019s comment was derogatory and rude.", "NTA Lisa\u2018s comment was really judging, shaming and completely unasked for. She\u2019s entitled to have her opinion but not to hurt others\u2019 feelings.\n\nFyi your family would be considered the norm in the majority of Europe (and possibly elsewhere too). We don\u2019t consider a naked body sexual per se, at least definitely not around family at home, or at the sauna, beach, gym, locker rooms, FKK areas, etc. It has absolutely nothing sexual or gross or weird about it, it\u2019s just the normal, natural way people look like if they don\u2019t happen to wear clothes\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NAH \n\nEveryone is entitled to their own opinion. If your friend doesn\u2019t think her parents have seen her naked then maybe remind her who wiped her ass those first few years. Additionally, the name calling was unnecessary and petty. If she doesn\u2019t call you back don\u2019t worry about it. A friend wouldn\u2019t act that way", "Without knowing the specifics of your dynamic, at first glance, it does sound a bit odd. That said, I too have seen my mom naked briefly while she\u2019s getting out the shower or changing, and my sister and mom have seen me naked too briefly in such instances.\n\nMy dad, I\u2019ve never seen naked, and he\u2019s never seen me naked except for when I was little and it was bathtime or whatever. So that element of it does strike me as strange. But that could just be my personal biases, and reading it again, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re lounging around naked in front of your parents to see everything in plain view. So, eh? \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA on this one, since Lisa\u2019s comment could\u2019ve been less inflammatory.", "NAH.\n\nShe was provoking you without realizing it because she didn't realize talking about the roommate was basically insulting you. So she didn't realize how upset you were. That probably made it quite a shock when you snapped at her and is why she didn't realize you were too upset to joke around. Doesn't sound like either of you meant anything bad by this.\n\nFor what it's worth, it may be weird so rather than tying the resolution here to her having to acknowledge that there's nothing weird, just focus on what really matters. As long as she doesn't think less of you and she accepts who you are, things should be fine. Confiding in close friends often means showing the weird parts of ourselves, just handle thinking each other are weird in a healthy way.", "YTA. Depending on where you live, it could be VERY uncommon for parents to see grown children naked. If you're mad because you're just realizing this, that is on you for being incurious.", "NAH\n\nI think this is normal for people around this age to have. I would, in the future, not take it personally when someone says something is weird... because they could be right.", "NAH. That is weird.", "nta, but it is very unusual for families to have that kind of dynamic, moreso the discussions of the kids sex life with her mom, but also the nudity. something being unusual is what weird means, so yeah, its kinda weird. if it works for you guys and the relationship is healthy than there's nothing wrong with that - in general people are way to sensitive about naked bodies and i think its cool you guys are that comfortable with yourselves. but it is kinda weird. and its ok to be weird, weird doesnt mean that something is bad, weird doesnt have to be a negative. i do tons of stuff thats weird. probably way weirder than you. just own it and be weird.", "Man I learned my family does all kinds of weird things once I left home. Sometimes the stuff you think is normal and ok is actually really messed up. \n\nYou\u2019re just starting the process of deciding for yourself which habits should stay and go.

But also, don\u2019t let other people drag the choices you\u2019re making for yourself.", "Nta. \nLisa should mind her own buisness. It wasn\u2019t her place to judge!", "NTA- she has no right to judge anyone for anything and she shouldn\u2019t have have said that or called you too sensitive when you got understandably upset. Also for her to get mad at you and get defensive and stop talking to you about a joke she made that made you upset she\u2019s not a real friend.", "Families and cultures have different levels of acceptable nudity. Where I live people generally don't see each other naked unless it's for intimacy or during childhood. We do, however, talk quite freely about sexual matters... which is a new thing, because my parents' generation didn't do that with us (even though they themselves were the \"let's fuck like there's no tomorrow\" generation). So NTA I guess, but your friend may have been surprised that her judgmental comment applied to you and doubled down on the defense, and it may also be true that she finds your dynamic genuinely disturbingly weird.", "NTA everyone's fam is different and if there's no abuse and everyone's happy, there should be no judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Brit over here, not really considered socially acceptable to be nude around family members over here.\n\nAnd yes, I know we left the EU, but we are still part of Europe.\n\nIt's also not considered acceptable in Ireland, or Germany.\n\nIts more acceptable in the southern countries and France.", "Also a Brit and it\u2019s perfectly socially acceptable.
