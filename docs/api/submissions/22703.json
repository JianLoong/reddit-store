Also, it's going to be a bit vague (I don't know if I can get in legal trouble), and even more background heavy.\n\nMy(28F) life, and my parents's marriage, was ruined because of an MLM.\n\nWhat happened was, my mother joined a supplement MLM, got way into it, drained both my and my brother's(33M) college funds, and went into tens of thousands of dollars of debt, to maintain her rank.\n\nWhen my father was injured and had to take some time off work, the house of cards she built came tumbling down.\n\nWe went from a loving home with two parents, a nice house in the suburbs, and at least 20k in a college fund; to our parents divorcing because she refused to leave the MLM, having to live in a crappy basement in our grandparents's house, and facing the reality of taking student loans if we want to go to college, as well as having to work as young teens, to help provide for our family of three. So, suffice to say, I hate MLMs with a passion.\n\nNow to the situation, my brother is marrying his fiancee(29F) of 4 years in 2 weeks. Last Saturday, I was invited to her bachelorette party. She said that she wanted a low key night at her home, with some food, some alcohol and some fun games.\n\nI get there, and including her, there are 14 other women. 3 of them are my cousins, who are 19 and 18.After I arrived (I was the last one there because I live 3 hours away), one of the women stood up and said that the fun can now begin.\n\nThen, she dragged a chest of sex toys, and started pitching us her MLM. From the get go, she said that my SIL agreed to host, and at the end of the night, depending on how much we got, she will get some money to help with her honeymoon.\n\nI was fuming, she knew how much both I and my brother hated MLMs, so I just stood to leave. Then I told my cousins to grab their bags and follow me. They tried to stop me (SIL and MLM hun), but I just said that we had to leave. But then, I couldn't just leave the other women to be preyed on. So I went on a rant about MLMs, how scammy they are, how I bet after plying them with alcohol, they will be pressured into buying stuff they didn't want, as well as into joining this pyramid scheme.\n\nMy SIL was teary by then, screaming at me to just leave, and that I ruined her bachelorette party.\n\nI grabbed my cousins and left. And while I felt a bit bad about ruining her night, I did not feel bad about standing to a scammer at all.\n\nMy brother says that while he completely understands where I come from, and that he had a really big fight with her, I should've just left with my cousins, without ruining the night altogether.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1689830490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154ht5z/aita_for_completely_ruining_my_future_sils/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone need to tell the SIL, not only she is not going to get anything, she is likely to be pressured into buying a shiteload of stuff she didn't need.", "NTA - who ambushes people at a Bachelorette with mlm nonsense? That's rude as heck. Even leaving out your personal experience, that was a shitty thing to do.\n\nAdding in what you went through, it was ridiculous of her to expect you not to leave and say why.\n\nTell your brother to address his fianc\u00e9e and her ambushing ways.", "NTA you did them all a favour. Now I\u2019m no expert on bachelorette parties, but an MLM pitch sounds like a lame as hell idea for a party, and that\u2019s not even getting into how scummy MLMs are.", "I cannot believe how many comments are missing all the context!\n\nI drove three hours to a not bachelorette party, you waited until I got there to start because you saw me as a target for sales and the kickback for your honeymoon budget. Mind you Im your future SIL who youve known for four years and you need a dick toy party to indirectly get money for your honeymoon with my brother? How bout saying hey, instead of a gift, would you mind putting whatever you were going to gift toward our honeymoon? thats at least direct.\n\nYouve known my brother and I for four years and you know we hate MLMs and we in fact have family trauma because of MLM involvement. If thats the party you want to throw, cool, but at least give a heads up because youre not an insensitive jerk or just a people user. Like hey, its an mlm, but my friend is the sales rep and sex toys are always fun to talk about at bachelorette parties, but please dont feel pressure to buy. \n\nIm also assuming future bride was a good hostess and only invited her peeps who were cool with sex toys being passed around the room at a party. I know they werent being used, but not everyone is cool with that and I suspect no one knew what future bride planned. \n\nAlso, did no one text OP on her drive that it was a sales party? were they all sitting there in the dark for a bit about it? so no one knew this was the party plan? why did future bride set this up this way? \n\nAnd finally I try to leave with my cousins who I suspect were ambushed and we\u2019re just going to leave, but now future bride and sales lady are trying to pressure me to stay to legitimize whats going on.

Good on you for getting them out of there", "NTA. Knowing your history with MLMs, i don't know what she expected by inviting you to her bachelorette/MLM party. She could have easily raised more money for her honeymoon by bringing up the topic at an actual party.", "Eh Nta. Your entire life was ruined by a pyramid scheme and now you\u2019re trying to prevent other possible susceptible women from being victims.

But she \u201cagreed to host\u201d so I bet she knew that this was an MLM and just wanted that sweet honeymoon money. Nope, she is an AH for agreeing to make her bridal party the butt end of a pyramid scheme after boozing them up just for a few bucks. That\u2019s a very shitty thing to do, and I wouldn\u2019t feel bad for you ruining her Tupperware/sex toy/ make-money-of-my-friends party", "NTA I'm sure your brother informed her what happened to your family and how much you two hate things like that, she still invited you and your cousins.

It wasn't a bachelorette party. It was a MLM orientation.", "NTA \n\nHow in the legitimate fuck does anyone think it's okay to shill sex toys at your friends bachelorette party, but then the bride is ok with it as well? She was down bad for that honeymoon though. Don't want your bridal shower ruined? Don't try to sell them a scam. What a wild concept.", "NTA. She tried to use her bachelorette party as a front for a pyramid scheme. She was planning to get you all drunk and scam you out of your money. That\u2019s an AH move. \n\nYou are totally justified in being pissed, knowing the impact that MLMs have had on your family. Good on you for standing up for yourself, and letting the guests know the truth about stuff like this.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing. They should have let you go and your SIL especially should have respected you wanting to leave, knowing the history.", "Maybe having her bach turn into a shitshow will have soured the proto-SiL on the whole MLM experience, and the OP has done her a huge favour.", "NTA your brother doesnt want to acknowledge the fact that fiance doesn't really give a fuck about him if she's willing to invite the very thing into their lives that crushed his family when he was a child. Point this out to him and be ready for the argument until he eventually grasps the truth. You're a good sister, protect your brother.", "NTA - Yeah, you came off rude, but it was justified. A hen's night should not be used as a platform to flog an MLM scam, especially adult toys. It's like a bait and switch.", "NTA.\nThat's not a fun night. Tf.\n\nAlso, you did the right thing. You know what kind of shit this is and now you can go without feeling bad about leaving them clueless.", "Not all heroes wear capes. NTA, good job for putting that shit down hard.", "I was scammed into a Mary Kay pitch when my bridal party and I \"won\" a spa day from a big box wedding shop. My licensed aesthetician bride's maid was having none of it. When she pitched becoming a \"hun\" I asked what her reports made and she refused to answer. My mom called her a c-word the minute we got in the car.\n\nSil might have been scammed into this \"party\" by a friend. The cult like nature of mlms is insidious and it can be hard to say no. You weren't wrong but show some compassion while setting a boundary.", "I\u2019ll be honest I was going to go with a everybody sucks here, but thinking more on your SiL using her hen do as a business opportunity was absolutely wrong and rude. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s not a party that\u2019s a trap!! \n\nPlus, not everyone is comfortable with sex toys in mixed company, you definitely check on that ahead if time too", "NTA This wasn't a Bachelorette party.

You came to celebrate your SIL, not listen to an endless sales pitch.", "Nta", "I suspect your brother has not thoroughly explained the family history or he sees it differently than you.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t a bachelorette part it was a sales exhibit. Your SIL sucks.  Had she been up front with her intentions and people attended willingly. Fine.  But she hid it bc she knew it was scummy and scammy.", "NTA - especially since she knew how you and your brother felt about MLM's.  She should have warned you that there would be an MLM pitch as part of the party, then you could have made a decision about whether or not to attend.\n\nI'm so sorry about what happened to you in your childhood about the MLM that your mother was involved with.  I think that your reaction to what happened at the party was actually a bit of PTSD.  It's possible you could have been a little extreme by warning the other guests like you did, but this really does feel like a trauma reaction for you.  You were acting out of a protective instinct towards the other women.", "NTA who has an MLM pitch at a bachelorette party? That's gross", "Way to GO!!!", "Using the excuse of a bachelorette party to pitch a scam that could ruin people\u2019s lives is fucking vile. NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be shamed for standing up to downright evil shit even if it makes someone cry. Plus, leaving these other women to possibly be scammed would suck. When you have one nazi at a table and four silent people, you have 5 nazis, that type of thing\n\nI can\u2019t believe someone who claims to love your brother could be complicit in the same shit that destroyed his life", "NTA. It's about time someone pushed back against MLMs, which rely on people just going with the flow when put into an awkward situation (like finding out the \"party\" they were invited to is really just a sales pitch).

I would have taken my present and left", "No! You just did at least one of them a favor! Fuck them! They said it would be a party and duped literally everyone there into a sales pitch! THEY are the asshole.", "NtA you got roped into some bullshit not a bachelorette party", "NTA", "Nta. A sex party bachelorette is the worst idea ever. And I love the mlm saying fianc\u00e9 gets help with honeymoon. Fianc\u00e9 gets overpriced sex toys based on how much you all fork up and sign up. My parents were amway. I would literally get in trouble for asking how it wasn\u2019t a pyramid scheme. Sorry this had such a huge hurt on your family.", "NTA", "NTA. How could she be so thoughtless?", "NTA.

Yeah it was rude of you to go on a rant and leave SIL in tears at her hen party but it is SOOOOO beyond tacky and rude to try and sell your bridesmaids, friends, and family MLM sex toys! Their behavior is predatory and I'm glad you were concerned about the impressionable and likely career seeking broke young adults who could have easily fallen victim.", "NTA\n\nHow could future SIL think this was okay?\n\nDoes she not know the history?\n\nAlso gross to do it at a \"hen do\"", "Nta- do not invite others to a party to profit off of them\n\nDo not try to profit off family and friends\n\nDo not invite the thing that ruined your finances families life to an event with family", "ESH - If you invite someone to a bridal shower, you shouldn't ambush them into attending a MLM event.

However I hope you\u2019ll give your SIL benifit of a doubt and now that you\u2019re of cooler mind, find out if she even knew what an MLM is.

You had a horrible experience with an exploitative MLM. No side-eye from me for wanting never to have anything to do with any of the MLMs ever again. Getting on a soapbox at what was (at least in theory) a party is not right either. Calmly give a very brief statement (personal experience, exploitative, high-pressure, recruiting, beware!). Wish the bride-to-be much happiness in her marriage. And leave. Others might follow or not. Sounds like everyone was an adult, so able to make their own decisions.", "Im not all about mlms either. I hate to be pressures into shit and i hate being lectured. With that being said, If what you're describing is one of the pure romance(I think that's the name) nights, then you ruined a party.\n\nThey're specifically structured like a party, with fun games and alchole.

Think about it like this: what if your mother had been an alcoholic instead? If you attended a party where others were drinking, would it be acceptable to act the way you did for this? I don't think so. I understand its not a perfect comparison, but alcohol has probably ruined more families than MLMs, so I think its an acceptable comparison.", "ESH.

I don't blame you for leaving and taking your cousins with you. I'm sure your future SIL knew about what happened to your family. Did she know the sex toy lady was part of a MLM or was this planned by a friend? Wow, what a nightmare.

I've also been to one from the same company, been to an Arbonne (cousin was the boss babe, but she doesn't anymore), a vitamin thing that had this big indoor garden tower where you could eat fresh vegetables all year (and save so much money!) after spending at least $800 dollars  and at least 1 pampered chef, maybe 2. I think all of these were from 2000 and beyond.  \n\nAll that established, during the opening spiel, I never, ever once heard the MLM-hun say that the host would get a percentage of the sales in the form of money. Those MLM huns get a commission of the sales, and the MLM is either a way to help with household expenses while being a SAHM and partners job alone isn't enough. Or they're doing it to add to their own income because it's again, not enough. \n\nAll of THAT established, the perks of being the host is that you get free stuff, plus some gifts. But, this is dependent on how much your guests spend. If your friends all together buy x amount, you get this much towards your purchase, a percentage off perhaps and better gift(a) the more that is bought. And the money you \"earned\" has to be spent to the last penny, you don't get the difference if you don't spend all available to you on the product. At least that has been my experience from the parties I've attended \n\nSo, I'm curious how the SIL was going to get at little towards her honeymoon? Was the sales friend going to give her some of the commission from the sales? How much was she going to give? Would it have actually made a dent in honeymoon cost or would it be the extra spending money? This is all very fishy. \n\nWhat's with the trend lately of turning traditional events in our lives and turning them into sales pitches?

At worst, SIL was using the bachelorette party to get more stuff (the stuff she might get for free) in addition to gifts from showers and the wedding itself. \n\nNTA, but it possibly might have been a bit much to do the rant. But it's understandable knowing your childhood trauma and the fact that you SIL chose to completely disregard that trauma.\n\nEdit: scratch that, your SIL also was trying to get you to stay after you got up to leave and only getting your college aged cousins who probably don't have all that much disposable income. If it had just been MLM hun, then don't make the scene. But your SIL tricked you and then tried to get you to stay. It's completely understandable with a bit more justification for telling the other women about the truth.
