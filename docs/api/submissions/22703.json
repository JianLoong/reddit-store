Also, it's going to be a bit vague (I don't know if I can get in legal trouble), and even more background heavy.\n\nMy(28F) life, and my parents's marriage, was ruined because of an MLM.\n\nWhat happened was, my mother joined a supplement MLM, got way into it, drained both my and my brother's(33M) college funds, and went into tens of thousands of dollars of debt, to maintain her rank.\n\nWhen my father was injured and had to take some time off work, the house of cards she built came tumbling down.\n\nWe went from a loving home with two parents, a nice house in the suburbs, and at least 20k in a college fund; to our parents divorcing because she refused to leave the MLM, having to live in a crappy basement in our grandparents's house, and facing the reality of taking student loans if we want to go to college, as well as having to work as young teens, to help provide for our family of three. So, suffice to say, I hate MLMs with a passion.\n\nNow to the situation, my brother is marrying his fiancee(29F) of 4 years in 2 weeks. Last Saturday, I was invited to her bachelorette party. She said that she wanted a low key night at her home, with some food, some alcohol and some fun games.\n\nI get there, and including her, there are 14 other women. 3 of them are my cousins, who are 19 and 18.After I arrived (I was the last one there because I live 3 hours away), one of the women stood up and said that the fun can now begin.\n\nThen, she dragged a chest of sex toys, and started pitching us her MLM. From the get go, she said that my SIL agreed to host, and at the end of the night, depending on how much we got, she will get some money to help with her honeymoon.\n\nI was fuming, she knew how much both I and my brother hated MLMs, so I just stood to leave. Then I told my cousins to grab their bags and follow me. They tried to stop me (SIL and MLM hun), but I just said that we had to leave. But then, I couldn't just leave the other women to be preyed on. So I went on a rant about MLMs, how scammy they are, how I bet after plying them with alcohol, they will be pressured into buying stuff they didn't want, as well as into joining this pyramid scheme.\n\nMy SIL was teary by then, screaming at me to just leave, and that I ruined her bachelorette party.\n\nI grabbed my cousins and left. And while I felt a bit bad about ruining her night, I did not feel bad about standing to a scammer at all.\n\nMy brother says that while he completely understands where I come from, and that he had a really big fight with her, I should've just left with my cousins, without ruining the night altogether.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1689830490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154ht5z/aita_for_completely_ruining_my_future_sils/", "score": 6695, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's rude as heck.

Now I\u2019m no expert on bachelorette parties, but an MLM pitch sounds like a lame as hell idea for a party, and that\u2019s not even getting into how scummy MLMs are.", "I cannot believe how many comments are missing all the context!\n\nI drove three hours to a not bachelorette party, you waited until I got there to start because you saw me as a target for sales and the kickback for your honeymoon budget. Mind you Im your future SIL who youve known for four years and you need a dick toy party to indirectly get money for your honeymoon with my brother? How bout saying hey, instead of a gift, would you mind putting whatever you were going to gift toward our honeymoon? thats at least direct.\n\nYouve known my brother and I for four years and you know we hate MLMs and we in fact have family trauma because of MLM involvement. If thats the party you want to throw, cool, but at least give a heads up because youre not an insensitive jerk or just a people user. Like hey, its an mlm, but my friend is the sales rep and sex toys are always fun to talk about at bachelorette parties, but please dont feel pressure to buy. \n\nIm also assuming future bride was a good hostess and only invited her peeps who were cool with sex toys being passed around the room at a party. I know they werent being used, but not everyone is cool with that and I suspect no one knew what future bride planned. \n\nAlso, did no one text OP on her drive that it was a sales party? were they all sitting there in the dark for a bit about it? so no one knew this was the party plan? why did future bride set this up this way? \n\nAnd finally I try to leave with my cousins who I suspect were ambushed and we\u2019re just going to leave, but now future bride and sales lady are trying to pressure me to stay to legitimize whats going on.

Nope, she is an AH for agreeing to make her bridal party the butt end of a pyramid scheme after boozing them up just for a few bucks.

It was a MLM orientation.", "NTA \n\nHow in the legitimate fuck does anyone think it's okay to shill sex toys at your friends bachelorette party, but then the bride is ok with it as well? She was down bad for that honeymoon though. Don't want your bridal shower ruined? Don't try to sell them a scam. What a wild concept.", "NTA. She tried to use her bachelorette party as a front for a pyramid scheme. She was planning to get you all drunk and scam you out of your money. That\u2019s an AH move. \n\nYou are totally justified in being pissed, knowing the impact that MLMs have had on your family. Good on you for standing up for yourself, and letting the guests know the truth about stuff like this.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing. They should have let you go and your SIL especially should have respected you wanting to leave, knowing the history.", "Maybe having her bach turn into a shitshow will have soured the proto-SiL on the whole MLM experience, and the OP has done her a huge favour.", "NTA your brother doesnt want to acknowledge the fact that fiance doesn't really give a fuck about him if she's willing to invite the very thing into their lives that crushed his family when he was a child. Point this out to him and be ready for the argument until he eventually grasps the truth. You're a good sister, protect your brother.", "NTA - Yeah, you came off rude, but it was justified. A hen's night should not be used as a platform to flog an MLM scam, especially adult toys. It's like a bait and switch.", "NTA.\nThat's not a fun night. Tf.\n\nAlso, you did the right thing. You know what kind of shit this is and now you can go without feeling bad about leaving them clueless.", "Not all heroes wear capes. NTA, good job for putting that shit down hard.", "I was scammed into a Mary Kay pitch when my bridal party and I \"won\" a spa day from a big box wedding shop.

My mom called her a c-word the minute we got in the car.\n\nSil might have been scammed into this \"party\" by a friend. The cult like nature of mlms is insidious and it can be hard to say no.

You came to celebrate your SIL, not listen to an endless sales pitch.", "Nta", "I suspect your brother has not thoroughly explained the family history or he sees it differently than you.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t a bachelorette part it was a sales exhibit. Your SIL sucks.  Had she been up front with her intentions and people attended willingly. Fine.  But she hid it bc she knew it was scummy and scammy.", "NTA - especially since she knew how you and your brother felt about MLM's.  She should have warned you that there would be an MLM pitch as part of the party, then you could have made a decision about whether or not to attend.\n\nI'm so sorry about what happened to you in your childhood about the MLM that your mother was involved with.  I think that your reaction to what happened at the party was actually a bit of PTSD.  It's possible you could have been a little extreme by warning the other guests like you did, but this really does feel like a trauma reaction for you.  You were acting out of a protective instinct towards the other women.", "NTA who has an MLM pitch at a bachelorette party? That's gross", "Way to GO!!!", "Using the excuse of a bachelorette party to pitch a scam that could ruin people\u2019s lives is fucking vile. NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be shamed for standing up to downright evil shit even if it makes someone cry. Plus, leaving these other women to possibly be scammed would suck.

It's about time someone pushed back against MLMs, which rely on people just going with the flow when put into an awkward situation (like finding out the \"party\" they were invited to is really just a sales pitch).

I would have taken my present and left", "No! You just did at least one of them a favor! Fuck them! They said it would be a party and duped literally everyone there into a sales pitch! THEY are the asshole.", "NtA you got roped into some bullshit not a bachelorette party", "NTA", "Nta. A sex party bachelorette is the worst idea ever. And I love the mlm saying fianc\u00e9 gets help with honeymoon. Fianc\u00e9 gets overpriced sex toys based on how much you all fork up and sign up. My parents were amway. I would literally get in trouble for asking how it wasn\u2019t a pyramid scheme. Sorry this had such a huge hurt on your family.", "NTA", "NTA. How could she be so thoughtless?", "NTA.

Yeah it was rude of you to go on a rant and leave SIL in tears at her hen party but it is SOOOOO beyond tacky and rude to try and sell your bridesmaids, friends, and family MLM sex toys! Their behavior is predatory and I'm glad you were concerned about the impressionable and likely career seeking broke young adults who could have easily fallen victim.", "NTA\n\nHow could future SIL think this was okay?\n\nDoes she not know the history?\n\nAlso gross to do it at a \"hen do\"", "Nta- do not invite others to a party to profit off of them\n\nDo not try to profit off family and friends\n\nDo not invite the thing that ruined your finances families life to an event with family", "ESH - If you invite someone to a bridal shower, you shouldn't ambush them into attending a MLM event.

You had a horrible experience with an exploitative MLM. No side-eye from me for wanting never to have anything to do with any of the MLMs ever again. Getting on a soapbox at what was (at least in theory) a party is not right either. Calmly give a very brief statement (personal experience, exploitative, high-pressure, recruiting, beware!). Wish the bride-to-be much happiness in her marriage. And leave. Others might follow or not. Sounds like everyone was an adult, so able to make their own decisions.", "Im not all about mlms either. I hate to be pressures into shit and i hate being lectured. With that being said, If what you're describing is one of the pure romance(I think that's the name) nights, then you ruined a party.\n\nThey're specifically structured like a party, with fun games and alchole.

Think about it like this: what if your mother had been an alcoholic instead? If you attended a party where others were drinking, would it be acceptable to act the way you did for this? I don't think so. I understand its not a perfect comparison, but alcohol has probably ruined more families than MLMs, so I think its an acceptable comparison.", "ESH.

I think all of these were from 2000 and beyond.  \n\nAll that established, during the opening spiel, I never, ever once heard the MLM-hun say that the host would get a percentage of the sales in the form of money. Those MLM huns get a commission of the sales, and the MLM is either a way to help with household expenses while being a SAHM and partners job alone isn't enough. Or they're doing it to add to their own income because it's again, not enough. \n\nAll of THAT established, the perks of being the host is that you get free stuff, plus some gifts. But, this is dependent on how much your guests spend. If your friends all together buy x amount, you get this much towards your purchase, a percentage off perhaps and better gift(a) the more that is bought. And the money you \"earned\" has to be spent to the last penny, you don't get the difference if you don't spend all available to you on the product. At least that has been my experience from the parties I've attended \n\nSo, I'm curious how the SIL was going to get at little towards her honeymoon? Was the sales friend going to give her some of the commission from the sales? How much was she going to give? Would it have actually made a dent in honeymoon cost or would it be the extra spending money? This is all very fishy. \n\nWhat's with the trend lately of turning traditional events in our lives and turning them into sales pitches?

At worst, SIL was using the bachelorette party to get more stuff (the stuff she might get for free) in addition to gifts from showers and the wedding itself. \n\nNTA, but it possibly might have been a bit much to do the rant.

I\u2019ve seen people start their own MLMs with their own products, only to all the sudden realize they can\u2019t pay their consultants and have to shut down their business and it causes a bad taste in people\u2019s mouth for all MLMs. \n\nWhile I know people have used Pampered Chef and other MLMs for their Bridal Showers because they love the product, I think it\u2019s only fair to be upfront if you plan on doing something like that.", "ESH if you really think it was out of line.\n\nSome MLM style orgs don\u2019t do the same pyramid scheme strategy, please check if SIL to be knew the difference.

She had all these gadgets lined up and I had a knife (I went home to get one of mine as my neighbors were dull). My knife and I were much faster than the PC rep with her gadgets. She made me promise not to tell and kept pushing me to be a PC rep since a man would be attention getting. \n\nI actually had a good time. I didn't buy anything and I certainly didn't sign up for the MLM. I met some neighbors I had not met before, and ate and drank for free. \n\nHowever the entire precept of all the MLMs as you put it is a house of cards.

In those moments when we're unfortunately subjected to their presence, I think we should at least consider the timing of a confrontation and the consequences of that confrontation to those around us.\n\n2) Removing yourself vs forcing your cousins to go with you. I think I understand your protection mentality for your cousins. That said, removing a sizeable number of people from your SIL's bachorette party has potentially event ending consequences for her. I think you can apologise for not having considered that enough in the moment. \n\nI think your SIL can apologise to you for a few things:\n\nA) Arranging an MLM event knowing you and your brother's history and trauma with MLMs. That is pretty fking insensitive. \n\nB) If she didn't realise her MLM friend had tricked her into an MLM event, she could have stopped it in the moment, especially once she saw your reaction. \n\nMy final thought on MLMs is that, the most toxic part is signing more people up to be salespeople and encouraging salespeople to drop thousands of $ on MLM conventions and sales training. The actual selling of the product itself (even with some high pressure sales tactics) isn't the root of evilness in MLMs in my opinion. I don't know exactly what happened at the bachorette party, I just wonder if the event could have mainly been a 'sex toy sale' event without as much focus on recruiting more members. \n\nMy best attempt to communicate the balanced perspective I had in my head :)", "I'm sorry but what is MLM?", "YTA-  I understand that you hate MLMs, but the parties can be fun to attend.  You don\u2019t have to join.  Sometimes their products are actually good.  I do think the SIL should have let you know ahead of time, with your history of how bad they really can be.  Your cousins have minds of their own and could decide if they wanted to stay or go.  They are adults.   And just because you buy a product or two, doesn\u2019t mean that it is going to ruin you.   I have actually been to a bachelorette party with one of these.  It was a blast.  I didn\u2019t buy anything that night because I didn\u2019t want to and I didn\u2019t feel bad.

I'm just gonna have fun with my badself. (That box lasted years lol)\nOf the MLMs, I will say, Pure Romance is the LEAST salesy and has the funniest parties. I just know not to fall the ploy.\nExcept for their Coochy. That shits amazing! Beat shaving cream ever. Honestly their lubes and other lotiony type items are pretty good.

It's not quite the same as other MLMs like lularoe and whatnot. Never once at any of the ones I've attended was any pressure put on people to join.
