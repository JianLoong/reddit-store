{"id": 3179, "submission_id": "z42fva", "title": "AITA for kicking my niece out on thanksgiving?", "selftext": "Background info- My niece moved in 3 weeks ago and we live in Texas, she is from Oregon so she flew down here and her father booked her ticket to come live with us because she had nowhere else to stay. She did not have a good relationship with her mom throughout the years and so a little after she turned 18, she left. She turns 19 in two weeks. \n\nMy niece lives with my and both my sons, 19 & 20M. My niece is very bubbly, and since she has been here, she\u2019s managed to get a job which is great, but she is not going to school. My niece has recently had a bad attitude, or at least distant I should say. It has been going on for a few days now and I don\u2019t know what it is, but it is starting to bother me. When I ask her what the issue is, she says nothing and proceeds to spend the majority of her day, not speaking to myself or my children unless spoken to, or will extend most of her day at work. \n\nMy niece was fully aware, that for thanksgiving, she needed to come meet the rest of her family. Both of my sons and myself left to go to the car, and on our way out of the door she decided to let us know that she wouldn\u2019t be attending because she \u201cwasn\u2019t in the mood\u201d then changed her answer and wouldn\u2019t give clear reasoning as to why. Once we got to our family\u2019s dinner, everyone was asking about her and my niece, 24F texted and asked her why she didn\u2019t come, she then proceeded to lie and say that she wasn\u2019t invited and that we left her. \n\nMy niece called her out on her lie, I then texted and told her that she had negative energy and that she embarrassed me by not coming, I told her I will give her a week to find someplace else to stay. She called and cried and tried to apologize saying she had nowhere else to go but I told her my answer would not change.", "created_utc": 1669346260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z42fva/aita_for_kicking_my_niece_out_on_thanksgiving/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That she might be embarrassed about her situation or nervous to meet a bunch of new people? That maybe she's just in a slump and needed a break?\n\nIt's wild to me that you could be decent enough to take her in, see all the efforts she's taking to be productive, and then turn around and reject her the moment she behaves like a teenager. On Thanksgiving of all days.", "YTA - she\u2019s 19 and allowed to not attend a family dinner if she doesn\u2019t want to. She just moved across the country, let her have some time to adjust. You sound like a dictator.", "Your niece is avoiding being at your home or around you and your sons for a reason. \n\nOne or both of your sons might be harassing/abusing her. \n\nTake her to lunch and ask a very hard question- has either of my sons been harassing you?", "YTA\n\nI get lying wasn't cool, but to kick her out and give her 1 week to find a place is unreasonable. She is not required to go to family dinners is she? That seems weird and controlling if so. I really think there is something more going on than you are telling.", "I saw the comment you deleted.  She's scared of your son.\n\nYTA.  Your son did something to her, or threatened to do something to her.  But your perfect precious baby can't have done anything wrong, so this poor girl who has no place else to go and is probably terrified both to be in your house and to be kicked out of it has to be the scapegoat.\n\nFind out WTF your son did, and if he was abusive or inappropriate, he goes and she stays.  Else YWB even more of an AH than you ara already are.  And you are already a major AH.", "Have you tried talking to her instead of just judging her by her recent attitude?\n\nYou said yourself that she was bubbly and got a job and seemed to be doing well until a few days ago. What happened a few days ago that made your niece miserable?  I\u2019m suspecting something \u201cfoul\u201d happened that you\u2019re unaware of but I could be wrong. Maybe I\u2019ve just been on reddit too long. lol \n\nSomething happened and instead of having empathy, you went on attack mode. \n\nYTA", "Why do you think she changed towards yourself suddenly? Did yourself ask her if anything happened? It sounds to me like she is trying to stay away from yourself and yourself's sons if she's staying at work longer than necessary. Maybe yourself's sons did something or said something.", "YTA.  You're supposed to be helping her.  That's why she's there.  She's gone through a lot.  You don't know how individuals react to the stress of a broken home.  Only reason to kick her out is if she's a threat to your kids or wife.", "YTA. She has a week to find somewhere else to live? That\u2019s pretty unfair. \n\nHave you considered that anxiety and/or depression could be playing a role in her behavior? \nAside from the lie, nothing you mentioned is that big of a deal. The lie could have been her anxiety boiling over and not knowing what to say.  Did you even bother talking to her about it before deciding to kick her out? \n\nI hope she does find somewhere else to live, though. She clearly can\u2019t trust you.", "YTA. Your niece moved half way across the country to live with you three weeks ago. She's found a job, and she's finding her feet, but it's a big change for her.\n\nI'm sorry her \"bad attitude\" isn't up to your standards, but quit being so selfish and demanding, and give the girl a little space to adapt to her new life.\n\nOh, wait - you're throwing her out after three weeks. You're not even giving her a chance to get established - the first sign of anything other than worshiping at your feet, and she's out.\n\nOh, and you're also TA for saying that she had \"negative energy\", whatever nonsense you suppose that means.", "ESH\n\n\"she then proceeded to lie and say that she wasn\u2019t invited and that we left her.\"  A young adult and she needs to know the impacts of such words. If she can easily blame you for not coming,  what is to say that she will accuse you of treating her badly and stuff?\n\nBut you are YTA for not giving her time to move out and informing her family about the situation", "YTA. She's an adult. She shouldn't have to justify to you why she doesn't feel up for attending a holiday event, and you shouldn't push her into corners and force her to give explanations. \n\nI wish that I hadn't gone to my holiday gathering today. I wish that I hadn't caved to the pressure of expectations, because it was terrible. If she doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go.", "INFO: have you gently approached her to see why she had this mood shift? She's only been there for three weeks. She managed to get a job in a short period of time and is otherwise bubbly up until recently. That's concerning.\n\nShe shouldn't have lied, but also- up until that, it seemed like she didn't do anything terrible and her behavior change is quite concerning. With the familial background you described (like why isn't she living with her father?), maybe the holidays caused this mood shift.", "YTA\n\nI sense that you were offended and already bothered from her not talking to you guys outside of responding to you. Nobody is entitled to have someone speak to them. It could be so many things going on with her, maybe something significant happened in the past leading up to or on Thanksgiving. You didn't even give her time, hell I wouldnt talk to you either. In this situation I see no adults.\n\nSo she made up a story you could've simply explained that away by saying whats been going on the last few days and had a serious conversation with her before you started power tripping.\n\nYou embarrassed yourself.", "I feel like this is a bit of a light YTA.\n\nI get it, she did something stupid, she lied.  But is that really something to kick her out over?  It sounds like she's going through some issues, possibly adjusting.  She's 18, barely an adult.  It feels like you should be doing more to try and support her / figure out what the issue is.  \n\nAnd now you are kicking her out.  Literally, wtf is she supposed to do?  Her father booked her a flight to get to you.  She's not from the area.  She obviously has no other support network there.  \n\n> She called and cried and tried to apologize saying she had nowhere else to go but I told her my answer would not change.\n\nWhat is she supposed to do?", "YTA for thinking the worst about this poor girl without making a real effort to find out what is the trouble. You are aware that she comes from a troubled background. She could be travelling with all sorts of trauma. And now you are turning her out of your home, after she told a fib to get out of being pressured to take part in an event with a whole lot of people she doesn't know. I am sorry, but I don't think you had any intention of helping her at all, and I am wondering why you took her in in the first place.", "YTA she sounds like she's dealing with some mental health issues. And at the very least is probably still adjusting to being there. Instead of being supportive, you kicked her out over a very minor infraction.", "I've seen your interesting reply, OP. \n\nMy answer is YTA.\n\nYou say your niece is uncomfortable around your 20 year old? In my clear opinion, I'm just seeing the red flag that your own child is sexually harassing her. \n\n100% I'm betting my measly salary I'm fucking correct in my assumption. \n\nWomen/girls always shut down when someone fucked them up. And I'll be blunt there's only two reasons why we do so. \n\n1. We are sexually/mentally harassed. ( especially if the abuser/s are near. )\n\n2. Our life was threatened. ( Repeatedly )\n\nIts up to you OP if you really want to know the ugly truth and if the truth is that your damn Son is a damn lecher and you chose to protect him instead of your niece who was the victim?.\n\n*I would pray to God your Family be destroyed by so much Karma you won't ever recover from it.*", "ESH. Your niece is going through some shit, just be honest about that to your other relatives, no need to be embarrassed and kicking her when she's down is what makes you an AH. Your niece is also an AH because going through some shit doesn't mean you can't still be an AH in how you treat people around you.", "YTA.  Leave the damn woman alone and let her get her shit together.  When many of these stories usually have the guest not working and being difficult, you got one who gets a job immediately and doesn't bother anybody.  \n\nLying about not going is weird but she should have never been put in that situation. Give her a break.", "YTA \n\nYou said she's been acting weird. Holidays are very hard on some people. Perhaps pushing a meeting with extended family only a few weeks after a significant life change was too much for her. Moving somewhere new is stressful. \n\nKicking her out because she didn't want to go somewhere seems a bit excessive. Sounds straight up heartless imo. You wanted what YOU wanted (her to go with you) at the expense of what she wanted (staying home). She's 18. That's old enough to say no. \n\nLying isn't ok either so she's an AH for that but you could have ran interference with the family and nobody would have started in on her about being there. \n\nAre you going to be pushy with her at Christmas too? If so, maybe her moving out is for the best. Sounds like she needs more support than you're willing to give. Because \"my way or the highway\" isn't going to work.", "I think kicking her out was harsh, yeah. I can\u2019t say YTA because you did give her a place to stay and seem to have tried to involve her in the family dynamics.\n\nBut kicking her out was a lot. She has no place to go so obviously something isn\u2019t going well in her life. Have you tried a one-on-one conversation to let her know how you\u2019re feeling and see what\u2019s up with her? \n\nWithout extra info it kinda seems like you\u2019re telling her what to do and what not to do. You\u2019re placing conditions on her living there after the fact, which is not ok.. She didn\u2019t agree to them and she\u2019s an adult. Did you make clear that her living there is dependent on her doing whatever you want her to?\n\nIt seems like there\u2019s a bit of info missing. What happened in your home around when her attitude changed? Were you treating her differently? Did something happen in her life that caused distress? People don\u2019t just change for no reason so it sounds like there was conflict that she\u2019s unhappy with. \n\nRather than kicking her out you should have come from a place of compassion. You should tell her that your feelings are hurt and why. Give her a chance to explain what\u2019s on her mind and way. Be open to criticism because I bet she has some to share. Would you want someone kicking your 18 y/o son out without discussion over something that\u2019s not dangerous or causing harm? Sure, lying isn\u2019t ok and you\u2019re within your rights to have her apologize to people for it and to tell the truth. As a parent I always give my kids a chance to correct behavior after I\u2019ve told them what the problem is. You skipped several steps.", "ESH\n\nThere's obviously a breakdown of communication happening here. Your niece is obviously not currently acting like her effervescent self and there's certainly a reason why. \n\nShe is technically an adult but she can't expect you to be able to help her with whatever emotional issue she is having if she refuses to talk about it. And nothing gives her the right to lie about being snubbed out of a family dinner. \n\nHave you tried talking to her about it? Tell her you've noticed a change in her demeanor and that you're concerned. Let her know that she was missed at dinner and ask her if there's anything you can do to make her more comfortable.\n\nSometimes someone has to be willing to take the high road to smooth things over. I'm sure you love your niece. Make sure she knows it too.", "YTA. None of this is a big enough reason to make a teenager homeless after she moved a couple thousand miles to come live with you. You seem to be using the fact that she has no other place to go in order to dictate her behavior. She literally just moved less than a month ago, she should be allowed time to adjust. Also, if we\u2019re being technical here, while you didn\u2019t leave her it really isn\u2019t an invite if you were intending to force her to be at thanksgiving dinner. Being made \u201caware\u201d that she \u201cneeded\u201d to meet the rest of the family isn\u2019t an invitation. Invitations can be declined. She\u2019s old enough to decide not to attend. Her \u201cbehavior\u201d could be anything from adapting to her new surroundings, something bad happened, she has trauma about holidays, or she has PMDD. You have barely given her a chance here. If you really didn\u2019t want her around you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to allow her to move in the first place.", "YTA and tbh kicking her out is a favor- so she can get as far away from you as possible.", "ESH Your niece for lying and copping attitude. You for using this as the excuse to kick her out. Tell your niece the only hope she has of staying in your home is to come clean and be honest with your extended family about today and with you about why she behaving the way she is.", "YTA for all the reasons", "Yta", "NTA the lie is childish and manipulative. Mental illness and maturity are two different things. She has been shutting you out. You can't make someone take help they don't want.
