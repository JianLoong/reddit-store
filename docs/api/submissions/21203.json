She lied to you and then was angry at you for seeing through the lie? You're the one who should be angry.

If you know she has a habit of lying, that's excellent motivation to drop her.", "NTA - I'm not sure which is worse: lying about the restaurant, or having the nerve to act like you were the bad guy for not hiding the fact that you went.", "NTA. What was the reason for your friend lying? Did they just not want to go and weren\u2019t brave enough to tell you? What did they stand to gain by this lie?", "NTA,\n\nWhy is she your friend?", "INFO: Why do you think this is your friend if she acts like this and lies to you repeatedly?", "NTA. I would have assumed that your friend had realized that the restaurant was not going to be in her budget so had found a face-saving way to get out of going. And so you went discreetly by yourself. Her making an issue out of it really seems to be bizarre and I would just ignore her.", "NTA. Good for you for calling out your friend\u2019s lies and BS. What makes her think she had the right to cancel your reservation especially when your daughter was really looking forward to going? Also, what is her problem with this place? Your family went to the restaurant and she was totally unaware that you did so obviously you guys weren\u2019t doing everything together and you had autonomy.\n\nIf this is how she acts I would advise you not to travel with you again. She is a complete control freak as well as a liar!", "NTA, but why would she lie about it? couldn't afford that restaurant? didn't make the reservation big enough?? what is her motive??", "NTA. What a bizarre reaction from your friend.", "NTA but your friend had something lets say shady go down at that place.", "NTA. Glad you and your family got to enjoy the restaurant everyone was looking forward to trying. The \u201cfriend\u201d would have been better off pretending she didn\u2019t see or didn\u2019t recognize the restaurant photos. She could have just dropped it and moved on. Instead, she tried redirecting anger towards you and attempts to make you out to be inconsiderate??? F that lady.

Eject this person from your life.", "NTA and if she\u2019s upset at you for this (rather than embarrassed to be caught in a lie which a normal person would be) she\u2019s not the friend for you-red flag!

Why are you still keeping a liar as a friend?\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t directly call her out. You didn\u2019t tag her right?", ">It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s lied to me\n\nNTA for going to lunch at the closed restaurant. But kind of an AH for being with this person who has a habit of lying to you & your family.  Why is that acceptable to you? Why is it acceptable to you; for her to be mad at your for seeing through her lie (you have no spine)? Is she the best friend you can get?", "Thank you. This was how I felt but just needed to know I\u2019m not crazy since she had such I strong reaction.", "Time\u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for 40yrs.", "We\u2019ve been friends since we were 12. We\u2019ve been thru a lot together over the past 40yrs. But I think it\u2019s done now\u2026 I have to look out for me now.", "I believe the \"trampling her feelings\" was the \"friend's\" comment, not OPs. OP is doubting themselves because the \"friend\" used that phrase and they're just as confused as the rest of us are.\n\nHonestly, I believe the \"friend\" is more upset about being caught in the lie and exposed. My response lends itself to a more \"boomer\" influenced answer though...\n\n\"If you can't do the time, don't do the crime\"\n\nActions have outcomes. The \"friend\" lied, got caught, and should do the right thing and accept that they got caught along with the outcomes of those actions.", "She said that I had \u2018trampled her feelings\u2019. Apparently she didn\u2019t want to go with us.", "I think what you mean is that you've known each other for 40 years. You are aquaintances. \n\nA friend is not just someone you know, but that involves also a good relationship. And lying is not a good foundation for a relationship.", "You are correct. Those were her words, she felt I had \u2018trampled her feelings\u2019 and did tell her in response that I think she\u2019s just upset I didn\u2019t hide the fact I knew she lied.", "And why did she not just say that she didn't want to go with you? Would you have pressured her into it?", "Nta this is awesome actually", "NTA, she lied to you and then got mad when she was caught. I think you should find better friends", "Weird, right?  I want to know why too.", "NTA to your friend but YWBTA if you keep bringing this person around your daughter.", "Was this restaurant particularly expensive? Like maybe she couldn\u2019t have afforded to go? Not excusing her behaviour or reaction, but I wonder if the not wanting to go was more something else. I mean you went on holiday together so it\u2019s not the company I assume.", "Who lies about a fucking restaurant being open? This is too stupid for words. NTA. Can\u2019t they just pass?", "Tell her! Maybe that will end her BS!", "NTA. Noone hates being called a liar more than actual liars, they get away with it so much they start to believe their own lies so it literally offends them when people call them our because it was true for them.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you DIDN'T take the easy way out.\n\nYou did your thing & didn't bother her.\n\nIf she's in trouble with *others* FOR HER LIE, retrospectively that's HER problem.", "Yes, curious about this too. I assumed that person actually took the reservation and took somebody else, but it sounds like that\u2019s not the case\u2026.", "\u201cFriend\u201d yeah sure. Treat yourself better and get rid of \u201cfriends\u201d who are not really friends.", "NTA - First, she LIED to you.  No excuse for that.  \n\n\nThen, after you dealt with it gracefully, she had the temerity to get mad about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's the AH.", "Yta for being spineless. And for letting her try to gaslight you now. \n\nStand up for yourself.", "I think she finds it easier to make up stuff then be honest with people. She didn\u2019t go, so as far as I can tell she cancelled the reservation instead of just letting us have it ourselves. \nTbh the lunch was lovey, it was oceanfront so we had a view instead of darkness\u2026 \nFYI. I have decided this isn\u2019t a friendship I value or want anymore- I wish her the best, but I need to know someone can be honest with me when it counts.", "I honestly think she didn\u2019t want to go and instead of her telling us she wanted to back out, she just lied to make it not her cancelling the plan we\u2019d had for months. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I did not tag her. As I said to her I posted photos of our trip, which did involve a lovely meal there which was a highlight for my daughter.", "Oh she\u2019s mad at me because I hurtfully posted pictures there\u2026 I did not say anything about how it went down or anything. Oh but she\u2019s forgiven me now\u2026 I however have not forgiven her, I don\u2019t think I will tbh", "Isn\u2019t that the truth!! Thank you", "I believe this situation is because I finally did stand up to her. I should have done it years ago! \nBut I wasn\u2019t able to as a preteen and then let the dynamics remain the same for years. I have said all I wanted to to her and she\u2019s ignoring my last message. I\u2019m done with her.", "Her strong reaction probably stems from embarrassment.", "I have no intention to continue the friendship now. She won\u2019t be around her."]}
