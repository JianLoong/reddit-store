My workplace always had a more relaxed dress code. We can wear what we want, to a reasonable extent, using common sense. For meetings with clients, we must dress more formally. On a regular day at our desks, we can wear jeans, t-shirts, leggings with long tops- as long as we still look reasonably smart and no offensive images/slogans are on our clothes, casual wear is okay.\n\nSome of my friend's work outfits have been low-cut mini dresses, crop tops - even *corset* crop tops. Not conventional work attire, but I said nothing as it wasn't my business - until yesterday when she asked if I liked her new top: a mesh crop top with a sports bra underneath and a very short mini skirt with sheer tights (I wear a black mini with thick tights, but my skirt sits just above my knee, whereas her's was above mid-thigh). I said it was cute, but she wears similar things on nights out. If an outfit is what you'd wear clubbing, it's probably not appropriate for the office. I reminded her that she complains about her manager's unexpected visits and having to throw on a hoodie to hide her outfits. If the manager surprises her before she can grab her hoodie - or if a colleague snitches (they all follow the dress code) - she could be reprimanded.\n\nShe said I was right, but this morning, I had messages from a couple of our friends. My friend was upset because she felt I'd \"slut-shamed\" her by saying her outfit looked like a clubbing attire. Her outfit was nearly identical to the last thing she wore when we had drinks - I don't think stating this fact is slut-shaming. She asked for my opinion; I was honest.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying an outfit will be cute for the club. It sounds like a cute outfit but wildly inappropriate for work (unless she works in a club).

I wonder if her asking if you liked her clearly scandalous outfit was an attempt to get you to notice her. If you didn't acknowledge her in that way, she could be feeling hurt or rejected and using accusations of \"slut shaming\" as a mask to justify her hurt feelings. Even without the possibility of her having a crush on you, it's still quite possible some feelings of shame and rejection are at the core of her reaction here.", "NTA.\n\nBut her outfit is extremely innapropriate anywhere outside recreational spaces. She knows it. She knows she\u2019s walking on thin ice at work. She asked your opinion. Now she\u2019s mad. \n\nThere\u2019s a kind of weird backlash right now where people are insistent that any kind of dress code is problematic.

You didn\u2019t slut-shame her.\n\nAnd, also, there\u2019s nothing wrong with dressing slutty or sexy. But again, at work we aren\u2019t having sex or flirting, we are working, and our clothes should communicate that when we\u2019re in an office space.", "NTA.

NTA.", "NTA - She shouldn\u2019t ask for an opinion if she don\u2019t want a truthful answer. \n\nIf I were you though, I would step back and not comment on her clothing, even if she asks. Slut-shaming is her reaching for a reason to be mad because you found fault with what she wore but what she really needs to learn here is that if she asks for feedback, it might sometimes be critical and she needs to learn to take that and work with it, not lash out and falsely accuse you of things you haven\u2019t done.\n\nIt\u2019s also her responsibility to dress appropriately for work or other occasions. You seem to take on too much worry/responsibility for that - if she gets a telling off from a manager then it happens, you can\u2019t prevent it and honestly, it might do her some good because she\u2019ll push at other boundaries eventually and there might be bigger things to lose than just getting told off by the boss for her dress.", "Thank you. The latter was a point I tried to make. I didn't leap to the assumption that her clothes were slutty - she did! I don't see club attire as \"slutty\" - I wear short minis and crop tops outside of work. She's seen me wear outfits like that! By my friend's logic, I slut-shamed myself. Her outfit was very cute. It's just not suitable for work - she knows this! If she gets into trouble, it's her own fault.\n\nI was worried I was being defensive, but I really don't think I said anything wrong.", "Thanks! I was worried I was just feeling defensive, but I really don't think I was slut-shaming her. I know what her company's dress code is. I know what is suitable for a club and what's suitable for an office. I've seen with my own eyes what she wears to go out in.\n\nI'd love to wear what I wanted to work - who doesn't? But if your job has rules, you risk getting into trouble if you break them. It's not wise to hide an outfit from your manager.", "Agree about the buzzword\n\nThis was not slut shaming. \n\nIf OP had called her outfit slutty or anything similar then yeah sure. But she said it is a) against the dress code and b) what she wears to the club which are both objectively true.\n\nShe didn't even make any judgement like it's unprofessional or something. Just stated facts which even the other girl agreed are true..", "I gave my opinion because she asked for it - but yes, I was honest because I'm worried she'll get into trouble. Hiding things from management is risky. I've said nothing prior because it's her job, so it's her business - although I almost spoke up a few weeks ago when she wore a corset. She's pushing her luck, which isn't smart.", "No, I didn't call her clothes slutty, and I certainly didn't mean to imply it. I'd be slut-shaming myself because I wear crop tops and mini skirts when I go out - my friend has seen me wear them. Clubbing outfits aren't inherently \"slutty\" (I think calling things slutty is misogynistic and often classist anyway). Her clothes are fun for going out in but break her company's dress code, which she knows.", "As we don't work for the same company (our offices are just close by), I'd have no reason to complain to HR - our jobs aren't connected. It was our friends that she complained to, not our colleagues (sorry if I didn't make that clear - I'll edit my post).\n\nMy friend is still my friend - she might be dealing with stress at the moment and lashed out over this. Maybe she felt sensitive because she knows she's breaking company rules and didn't want to be told. I'm not sure. I'm going to talk to her about it when I next see her.\n\nBut thank you. I don't believe I slut-shamed her either.", "Thanks! I definitely won\u2019t say anything going forward because I\u2019ve made my point.

Even my mother enjoys an occasional night out dancing. I have friends older than me who have children, and they like to go out every now and again. Sometimes for drinks in a bar or pub, sometimes to a club.\n\nIn my city, there are some bars and clubs that attract an older crowd. Some are mixed. Some are venues where it's mostly 18 - young twenty-somethings. My friends and I don't go to the latter places anymore, as the scenes are too young.", "You clearly didnt read the post", "It's fine if you still think I'm the AH, but you've misread the post - yes, her workplace does have a dress code. She hides her outfits from her manager because she knows her current outfits break the rules.\n\nI didn't say anything about her clothes until *she asked me* for my opinion on her outfit. It's her choice what she wears. I just don't want her to get into trouble, as she knows she's breaking company rules. The clothes wouldn't be an issue if her workplace had no dress code.", "Fair enough. I do see your point.\n\nIf I could abolish dress codes for reasons other than safety, I would. Most are archaic. Clothes don't usually impact how a person does their job, and a suit doesn't make someone professional. Sadly, the reality is that few offices let employees wear mini skirts and crop tops (I don't know of any in my area). My friend has bills to pay, and I don't want the worst-case scenario to happen where she loses her job because she's taking a risk, hiding her clothes.\n\nSome jobs are slowly getting better. My workplace relaxed its rules on hair dye, visible tattoos, and facial piercings a few years ago.", "Usually, we\u2019re all honest with each other. As the others weren\u2019t present for our conversation, that might have thought I was snappy with her.\n\nSomeone else here raised a really good point I didn\u2019t consider - that my friend might have wanted feedback on her outfit in general. I only mentioned it was inappropriate for work because it was the outfit she was wearing to her office that day. Since she knows she\u2019s breaking the rules, I didn\u2019t need to tell her. It could be why she thought I was slut-sharing her - even though I stand by my belief that I didn\u2019t. Clubbing outfit doesn\u2019t have to equate to \u201cslutty\u201d. She made that leap, not me. I wear similar outfits in my free time, especially when I go out. She\u2019s seen my wear them! So, I\u2019d be slut-shaming myself.\n\nBut regardless, it\u2019s on my friend if she gets into trouble. I think she\u2019s being very immature and silly, playing with fire by hiding outfits she knows breaks company policy\u2026but hey ho.", "Thank you.\n\nNo, she definitely doesn't have a crush on me. She's straight. We work for different companies, and she's dressed \"inappropriately\" (broken the dress code) for a while now. I'm sure nothing changed on, say, a day when I was off work and didn't travel into the city with her.  I don't think she fancies any of her colleagues either, as she would have told me and our friends if she liked someone. She's been open about former colleagues she thought were cute. \n\nI presume she's just enjoying wearing what she wants because there's usually no authority around to tell her otherwise. I'm hoping her colleagues don't care and none of them will snitch.", "In an ideal world, we would wear whatever we wanted, but that's not reality, so I agree. I'd love to do away with dress codes and dress \"fun\" for work, but it's true that we can't just go about doing as we please.\n\nThanks for the feedback. My friend and I work for different companies, so we aren't co-workers, but I will let the matter drop unless she brings it up again. She might have wanted my opinion on her outfit as it was - not a cautionary warning since she already knows she's breaking company policy. It could explain why she felt sensitive and thought I was shaming her, even though I wear similar outfits outside of work, so I'd be shaming myself...but hey ho. I'll see how things go when I see her next week. I just hope she isn't caught breaking the dress code at her work and written up. It will be her own fault if it happens.", "I\u2019m guessing she got upset because she asked what you thought of her top *in general* not in a specific setting (work v social), and by including those stipulations she interpreted that as you judging. \n\nEither way, very much NTA. Your looking out for her is well-intentioned but doesn\u2019t seem to be well-received. If this a boundary for her, then keep it general, tell her you like (or dislike) the clothes, and just be supportive when things play out however they may.", "Well now she is throwing around buzzwords like slut shaming and complaining to other workers. She is involving *you*. You don\u2019t want any part of this drama and she is trying to drag you into it.", "honestly, the only situation in which I\u2019d call you TA is if you went to management. otherwise yeah, NTA at all", "She\u2019s daft if she thinks her managers will never find out. Managers always know more than you think they do and someone will usually tell them eventually.", "That\u2019s a good point! I didn\u2019t consider that. When I next see her, I\u2019ll mention this.\n\nIf it were any other time, I just would have complimented her outfit. I only mentioned that it broke her company\u2019s dress code because it was the outfit she was wearing for work, and we were walking to our offices.", "We don't work for the same company - it was our friends that she complained to. Sorry if I didn't make that clear.\n\nOur friends think she was being dramatic, but I shouldn't have said her outfit was a clubbing outfit. I was worried I'd been defensive, but I stand by what I said - her outfit *is* the clothing she wears clubbing (I wear the same things when we go out), so I wasn't shaming her. I just gave my honest opinion, and my friend knows she's breaking her company's rules.", "Thanks. :)\n\nOh god, I definitely wouldn't snitch. I'd even call her colleagues an AH if they snitched because \"inappropriate\" clothes won't kill anyone - only management should interfere if my friend is caught.", "Totally understandable, and I can\u2019t say that I wouldn\u2019t have said something similar. \n\nThankfully *you know* you\u2019re not her mom or her boss, nor are you trying to be. You\u2019re able to respect her decisions even if you don\u2019t necessarily agree. I\u2019d say you\u2019re a good friend. And for perspective, getting written up for being out of dress code is probably not career-ending. (And if it is, oof\u2026 But also still her decision.)"]}
