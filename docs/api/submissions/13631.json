My workplace always had a more relaxed dress code. We can wear what we want, to a reasonable extent, using common sense. For meetings with clients, we must dress more formally. On a regular day at our desks, we can wear jeans, t-shirts, leggings with long tops- as long as we still look reasonably smart and no offensive images/slogans are on our clothes, casual wear is okay.\n\nSome of my friend's work outfits have been low-cut mini dresses, crop tops - even *corset* crop tops. Not conventional work attire, but I said nothing as it wasn't my business - until yesterday when she asked if I liked her new top: a mesh crop top with a sports bra underneath and a very short mini skirt with sheer tights (I wear a black mini with thick tights, but my skirt sits just above my knee, whereas her's was above mid-thigh). I said it was cute, but she wears similar things on nights out. If an outfit is what you'd wear clubbing, it's probably not appropriate for the office.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying an outfit will be cute for the club. It sounds like a cute outfit but wildly inappropriate for work (unless she works in a club).

Would your friends also like to message her manager complaining that she should be allowed to wear club outfits to work?

I wonder if her asking if you liked her clearly scandalous outfit was an attempt to get you to notice her. If you didn't acknowledge her in that way, she could be feeling hurt or rejected and using accusations of \"slut shaming\" as a mask to justify her hurt feelings. Even without the possibility of her having a crush on you, it's still quite possible some feelings of shame and rejection are at the core of her reaction here.", "NTA.\n\nBut her outfit is extremely innapropriate anywhere outside recreational spaces. She knows it. She knows she\u2019s walking on thin ice at work. She asked your opinion. Now she\u2019s mad. \n\nThere\u2019s a kind of weird backlash right now where people are insistent that any kind of dress code is problematic. I don\u2019t agree\u2014our dress is a communication as clear as our words. Her outfit sounds awesome. It also sounds like she\u2019s having fun, not working professionally. \n\nI think you should just tell your friends you\u2019ve said your piece, if coworker-friend wants to talk more about it, she can come to you directly.\n\nAlso, slut-shaming is humiliating women for exhibiting or being perceived to exhibit sexual behavior and desire, and also suggests that if they are sexually assaulted or harassed, it\u2019s their own fault. You didn\u2019t slut-shame her.\n\nAnd, also, there\u2019s nothing wrong with dressing slutty or sexy. But again, at work we aren\u2019t having sex or flirting, we are working, and our clothes should communicate that when we\u2019re in an office space.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m a woman who dresses a lot like Coworker outside the office.

NTA.", "NTA - She shouldn\u2019t ask for an opinion if she don\u2019t want a truthful answer. \n\nIf I were you though, I would step back and not comment on her clothing, even if she asks. Slut-shaming is her reaching for a reason to be mad because you found fault with what she wore but what she really needs to learn here is that if she asks for feedback, it might sometimes be critical and she needs to learn to take that and work with it, not lash out and falsely accuse you of things you haven\u2019t done.\n\nIt\u2019s also her responsibility to dress appropriately for work or other occasions. You seem to take on too much worry/responsibility for that - if she gets a telling off from a manager then it happens, you can\u2019t prevent it and honestly, it might do her some good because she\u2019ll push at other boundaries eventually and there might be bigger things to lose than just getting told off by the boss for her dress.", "Thank you. The latter was a point I tried to make. I didn't leap to the assumption that her clothes were slutty - she did! I don't see club attire as \"slutty\" - I wear short minis and crop tops outside of work. She's seen me wear outfits like that! By my friend's logic, I slut-shamed myself. Her outfit was very cute. It's just not suitable for work - she knows this! If she gets into trouble, it's her own fault.\n\nI was worried I was being defensive, but I really don't think I said anything wrong.", "Thanks! I was worried I was just feeling defensive, but I really don't think I was slut-shaming her. I know what her company's dress code is. I know what is suitable for a club and what's suitable for an office. I've seen with my own eyes what she wears to go out in.\n\nI'd love to wear what I wanted to work - who doesn't?

Just stated facts which even the other girl agreed are true..", "I gave my opinion because she asked for it - but yes, I was honest because I'm worried she'll get into trouble. Hiding things from management is risky. I've said nothing prior because it's her job, so it's her business - although I almost spoke up a few weeks ago when she wore a corset. She's pushing her luck, which isn't smart.", "No, I didn't call her clothes slutty, and I certainly didn't mean to imply it. I'd be slut-shaming myself because I wear crop tops and mini skirts when I go out - my friend has seen me wear them. Clubbing outfits aren't inherently \"slutty\" (I think calling things slutty is misogynistic and often classist anyway). Her clothes are fun for going out in but break her company's dress code, which she knows.", "As we don't work for the same company (our offices are just close by), I'd have no reason to complain to HR - our jobs aren't connected. It was our friends that she complained to, not our colleagues (sorry if I didn't make that clear - I'll edit my post).\n\nMy friend is still my friend - she might be dealing with stress at the moment and lashed out over this.

She hides her outfits from her manager because she knows her current outfits break the rules.\n\nI didn't say anything about her clothes until *she asked me* for my opinion on her outfit. It's her choice what she wears. I just don't want her to get into trouble, as she knows she's breaking company rules. The clothes wouldn't be an issue if her workplace had no dress code.", "Fair enough. I do see your point.\n\nIf I could abolish dress codes for reasons other than safety, I would. Most are archaic. Clothes don't usually impact how a person does their job, and a suit doesn't make someone professional. Sadly, the reality is that few offices let employees wear mini skirts and crop tops (I don't know of any in my area). My friend has bills to pay, and I don't want the worst-case scenario to happen where she loses her job because she's taking a risk, hiding her clothes.\n\nSome jobs are slowly getting better. My workplace relaxed its rules on hair dye, visible tattoos, and facial piercings a few years ago.", "Usually, we\u2019re all honest with each other. As the others weren\u2019t present for our conversation, that might have thought I was snappy with her.\n\nSomeone else here raised a really good point I didn\u2019t consider - that my friend might have wanted feedback on her outfit in general. I only mentioned it was inappropriate for work because it was the outfit she was wearing to her office that day. Since she knows she\u2019s breaking the rules, I didn\u2019t need to tell her. It could be why she thought I was slut-sharing her - even though I stand by my belief that I didn\u2019t. Clubbing outfit doesn\u2019t have to equate to \u201cslutty\u201d. She made that leap, not me. I wear similar outfits in my free time, especially when I go out. She\u2019s seen my wear them! So, I\u2019d be slut-shaming myself.\n\nBut regardless, it\u2019s on my friend if she gets into trouble.

My friend and I work for different companies, so we aren't co-workers, but I will let the matter drop unless she brings it up again. She might have wanted my opinion on her outfit as it was - not a cautionary warning since she already knows she's breaking company policy. It could explain why she felt sensitive and thought I was shaming her, even though I wear similar outfits outside of work, so I'd be shaming myself...but hey ho.

Dang....", "NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nBut it's a minefield\n\nI helped a female friend to get a job at my place, and have had to give her a hint a couple of times that she's dressed super inappropriately for an office, and she always takes it on board but also makes sure to make me feel like shit for bringing it up\n\nfuck me for trying to help someone not get embarrassed and reprimanded, right?", "NTA. Anyone that asks for a compliment can't be taken seriously.", "NTA. If she feels shame, that's on her, not you.", "NTA\n\nI have a feeling your friend knows she's dressing inappropriately for work, but you saying it out loud makes it real so you're now the \"bad guy\".", "Your not HR so its not really your place to enforce workplace attire. Next time your asked if you like an outfit you think is inappropriate it would have been better to respond along the lines of...\n\n \"Yeah you look good but I don't think I would wear something like that in a work setting because its more like club attire and I'd want to be viewed based on my intellect and work ethic and not sex appeal. But that's just me!\"\n\nThis way you are not judging her choice per say, but rather saying its not a choice you would make for yourself for x,y,z reasons. She can't get mad at you for that. \n\nNTA", "You were a good friend and reminded her that she was actually dressing in a way that was against company policy and highlighted her previous struggles while hiding her clothing from her employer.\nShame if he loses that job and can't afford new clothes.", "If your friend is having to hide her outfits from management, chances are it's not entirely work appropriate.", "I think so too, and a few others pointed this out. She already knows she\u2019s breaking rules. I haven\u2019t properly spoken to her yet, so I\u2019ll mention it to her. It\u2019s probably why she assumed I was being critical.", "You\u2019re right, I\u2019m not HR. She already knows she was breaking rules, so I could have just said her outfit was nice.\n\nBut I don\u2019t anyone should ever tell a woman what she wears creates assumption about her worth ethic and intelligence - that leans way too far into misogyny and classism.", "NTA. \n\nShe knows her clothes break the dress code and she knows it's similar to what she wears to a night out when she wants to look hot. You just observed that. It's not \"out of line\" to neutrally observe a fact in direct response to a question. It's quite telling she took offense to that. Plus, you said you thought it looked cute.\n\nI consider myself very sex-positive, but imo it doesn't mean everyone should get to dress in whatever provocative or titillating way they want to *everywhere*. Some environments, like workplaces, are expected to stay professional, and your friend is intentionally flirting with disaster, and doesn't like hearing the truth. But that's a she problem. \n\nImo you didn't slut-shame, you just answered her question honestly (but politely). Don't ask when you already know the answer but don't want to hear it.", "Turn it around on your flying monkey friends and ask them why they think clubbing attire is automatically slutty.", "I think \u201cthat looks like what you wear when you go to the club\u201d is practically an objective statement. You didn\u2019t say it was slutty or sexy, you compared it to what she already wears.", "NTA but she didn't ask, is this appropriate? She asked you if you liked it.", "Well, now you know that she\u2019s not interested in your opinions on this. It\u2019s up to her to decide if her choices are worth the risk.", "Exactly. It also sounds like someone has mentioned her clothing to the boss in the past, so there's good reason for her to be careful about her attire.", "Yes, someone else raised this point. I hadn\u2019t considered it. It\u2019s something to consider in the future.\n\nSince she already knows she\u2019s taking a risk with her outfits at work, I didn\u2019t have to mention the rule break.", "NTA. It's not shaming to note that different environments call for different clothes. I wear different things on the weekend than I wear to work. You didn't give her unsolicited advice; she asked for your opinion. She also knows that when she's wearing wouldn't be appropriate for the office, if she quickly covers herself up when a manager comes in.", "NTA. She asked your opinion and you gave it- nicely. If she didn\u2019t want an honest response she shouldn\u2019t have asked for one. She needs to grow up.", "NTA and good friends watch out for each other\u2019s best interests (the work comment). You seem super cool and chill - the slut shaming doesn\u2019t seem like there was any intention of that in the least. Your honest opinion of her attire is coming from you not wanting her to have any issues at work. \n\nYou\u2019ll just have to not worry about that for her since she is aware.", "NTA. She literally asked your opinion and then she got mad at you. She crazy.", "NTA and you shouldn't have apologized. She threw that phrase around when stated the obvious that she has had to grab a hoodie. Your friends opened their mouths before the story and they still were wrong. You weren't wrong and you didn't need to change your speech. You was not out of line because you didn't demean or degrade. You complimented her and pointed out how it doesn't seem office appropriate especially if she has complained about having to cover. She knows it's not appropriate.", "NTA.  I would have responded to the friends by asking, \u201cwould their accusations regarding your comments be the sane if she tried to wear those outfits into a restaurant where formal wear is required and she was denied entry due to dress code violation?\u201d  Or would their accusations be the same if she was fired for dress code violations?  Your comments were not slut shaming, they were pointing out that her clothes do not fit the required dress code.  If I was a manager and walked in to find her in a mesh too with sports bra underneath, darn right I would write her up for it and come in randomly to catch her at it and the third time, she would be gone.  I get being comfortable, but her appearance affects the impression the customers has of the business.  Club wear while awesome, does not make people think, man they are good at their job and I like their attitude.  It makes them think was she out all night because she didn\u2019t dress like that for work and is she drunk still?", "Observing objective reality is not SHAME. I wish people would stop misusing this word. NTA.", "It's better to be 'slut shamed' by a friend than called down to HR to have a little talk because your manager disapproved of what you were wearing. Depending on the industry that she's in, she might be able to get away with wearing that to work but since her work has a dress code she needs to follow that. Casual dress doesn't mean that you can wear anything to work (like pajamas or body con dresses) it must adhere to your businesses dress code. Some managers will base promotions partly on adherence to a dress code since you are representing the company on company time.\n\nIf you have to run and hide your clothing for fear of being called out, you know that you are violating the dress code.  I know lawyers who dress casually for work but keep a suit, tie and dress shoes in their office in case they have to make a surprise court appearance.\n\nSince your friend doesn't really seem to want your opinion, just say her outfit looks nice. It is she who will have to face the repercussions of dressing inappropriately at work.", "NTA but don't get involved from now on. Let her find out for herself what her boss will do if he sees her dressed like that.", "NTA  \nSlut-shaming was NOT what you did. You said you liked her outfit but it was more appropriate for a club, which sounds true to me. You didn't say she shouldn't wear it ever juts in the right situation which is NOT at the office. She asked for your opinion and you gave it and she just didn't like the answer.", "NTA she ASKED. And you were very polite.", "NTA - if she's grabbing a hoodie to hide her outfit, she needs to rethink her outfit. ALSO, you weren't slut shaming her. You were asked your opinion about her outfit and you gave it, simple.", "nta, she asked and you gave an honest answer but didn't belittle her, you simply told her that her outfit seems more outside of work and she may be in trouble if someone sees", "Yes, it\u2019s a perspective I didn\u2019t consider. I could have answered on whether I objectively liked her outfit, which I would have done on any other occasion. When she wears mini skirts and crop tops outside of work, it\u2019s fine. I wear similar outfits in my free time.\n\nWhen she told me and our friends about hiding her clothes from management, we did warn her it was risky.\n\nI\u2019ve never addressed it on any other occasion because I didn\u2019t feel I had to. She\u2019s an adult woman who dresses herself. She knows she\u2019s breaking policy, so she didn\u2019t need a warning (again, I could have neglected to mention anything work related). We don\u2019t work for the same company, so our professional lives aren\u2019t linked. I\u2019m not HR or her manager, so I can\u2019t reprimand her. On this occasion, she asked my opinion on her top whilst we were walking to our offices, so I gave my opinion.", "Thanks for the super respectful response to my very unpopular opinion.\n\nBut the reason you didn't talk to her about it before? That didn't stop being a good reason not to say it.", "She was about to wear it to work? Good golly. If anything that make your feedback even more appropriate.", "There's always somebody who is willing to snitch.", "Exactly. So when you give an opinion of someone\u2019s attire outside of \u201cyou look nice\u201d frame the negatives as \u201cI wouldn\u2019t for x,y,z reasons\u201d. Make it about yourself. \n\nI once had to tell an employee that I didn\u2019t want her wearing heels to the job site not because it was unprofessional or inappropriate (all true) but because I was concerned about her safety on-site (also true). As cute as those heels are, I want your ankles to be safe.", "I don\u2019t disagree. In future, if she asks for my opinion on something she\u2019s wearing to work, I\u2019ll only say if I like it - nothing about the dress code. That\u2019s her prerogative.", "Agreed, and I usually do - it\u2019s a tactic I learned in therapy as a teen for confrontation. I could have used \u201cI\u201d sentences when speaking to my friend. We\u2019re usually open with each other and can speak plainly and comfortably.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree with the method. Please just don\u2019t tell women their clothing is an excuse for others to make assumptions about their intellect or worth ethic. That\u2019s where I disagree.", "Here is another issue her breaking dress code at work if she caught she could ruin it for everyone they might buckle down and in-state a much  Stricter dress code and she could be fired", "Your answer was very much appropriate to her question. Just ask her where her boundary is. If it's that if she's asks what you think of her outfit, she just wants a general opinion, that's fine, but I think most people would say it's normal to talk about where one might or might not wear such an outfit.\n\nI like to wear a button-down shirt with a very cool Cheshire cat print with a black tie, black bottoms and a purple-striped cardigan (like the Cheshire cat). I can do it at this company but it might not fly at other  companies.\n\nIf anybody is curious about the button-down, they don't seem to sell the Cheshire cat anymore, but it's this brand and you can get a sense of how loud it is : https://blackmilkclothing.com/shop/top/shirts-blouses?page=1", "What? Where did I say to tell women their clothing is an excuse to make assumptions about intellect or work ethic. \n\nI literally said \"I'd want to be viewed based on my intellect and work ethic and not sex appeal.

I didn\u2019t mean to imply that I think her clothes signal she isn\u2019t smart or she\u2019s a lazy worker - if that\u2019s why you used it your example? It rubbed me the wrong way because it\u2019s a sexist attitude I hear all to often regarding women\u2019s outfits. They\u2019re just too casual for most offices.

She had no one to explain how attention is not the same as respect. She has no idea how how to dress sensually without wearing something loud, garish, and provocative: which is perfect for a club, but not for an office environment. This, coupled with her total lack of common sense and her penchant for gossip instead of direct communication, spells a future without promotions. You may want to think how your association with this immature person reflects on *you*. Think about putting some distance between you and this person.", "NTA. You were bringing up legit points that could get her fired. If it was about what she was wearing to the club then I'd say you were slut shaming. You said your piece on the subject. Let it go.
