About a year and a half ago now I moved to a different state about 6-7 hours away depending on traffic. \n\nI'm thinking of applying for the mortgage with them, as then we could offer more than the other tenant and be approved no problem, as I make almost as much as my two parents combined, and I have better credit. However if I did this, it would be with the plan that once my lease is up on my apartment, I move in with them or my grandparents for a few months, then once the current tenants lease is up we don't renew it and I move into the other half of the Duplex.
