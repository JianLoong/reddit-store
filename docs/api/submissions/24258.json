NTA tell him if he feels that way you won't ride with him.", "Instead of expressing himself, your brother chose to sulk and blame others for him not getting what he wanted. This isn\u2019t an emotionally mature way for him to act. It may also be considered controlling or attention seeking behavior. \n\nHis poor behavior and unhappiness are most definitely not anything you should blame yourself for. You did absolutely nothing wrong. This is completely a lacking within your brother or (possibly) issues with his relationship with his gf. \n\nJust be aware that this might be a pattern of behavior for him. You can try to ignore it. Alternatively, you can try to force him to express what he wants & that may stop him from indulging in this type of behavior. \n\nI had a similar experience with someone in my life. If we went out to eat, he\u2019d refuse to pick or give an opinion on a restaurant. Afterwards, if everything wasn\u2019t ideal, he\u2019d complain. Say that he knew we should have gone to X or Y restaurant. The first few times, I ended up apologizing for my poor choice. Then, I recognized the pattern and how he was controlling our interaction so that he was a victim and I felt at fault. I started to try to force him to make a choice or express a preference. Sometimes he refused to and we ended up not going anywhere. Our relationship eventually ended for this and other issues.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he wanted the private time with his gf on the drive back he should have spoken up during the multiple times his gf was inviting you to ride with them.
