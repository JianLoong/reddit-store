My lease was up and he offered have me move in as his roommate was moving around the same time. We agreed to split the cost of everything 50/50. For context we both make decent money and roughly have the same earning, but I WFH and have no debt while he commutes and has decent amount of debt. At the beginning everything was fine, but he slowly started doing less around the house getting to the point of leaving all household chores to me, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. When I confronted him about it he said he believed in \"traditional roles\" and it was my job as the woman of the house to do these duties. I was taken aback, but quickly recovered and told him I also agreed in traditional roles and as such it was his duty to be the provider of the household, therefore, I would no longer be contributing financially. He argued that it was not what we agreed to and that would put him in a tight situation financially. I simply explained that I was following his beliefs. By the third week we ran out of groceries, he had no money, and he didn't get paid till the following Friday. He asked me to buy the gorceries so we wouldnt be left without food for the time being. I told him he needed to figure it out as i was not going to be interfering woth his role of being the provider. The next few days id go out to eat during my lunch breaks so i wouldn't eat in front of him and cave into buying him food. I finally felt bad and told him that we can either keep this arrangement of \"tradional roles\" or we can split EVERYTHING 50/50 like we originally agreed. I explained i was not ok with following tradtional roles only when it was beneficial for him. He is now upset calling me an AH for allowing him to go hungry by refusing to pull my weight financially and for judging his believes.

I just think this whole post is fake.", "NTA.  I appreciate the level of petty you reached here OP, it\u2019s beautiful.  But seriously, why are you still with him?  You should have given him the boot the second he revealed he believes in traditional roles.  Even if you like the traditional roles, the fact that he entered the relationship pretending to like the 50/50 split is reason enough to dump him.  He manipulated you by concealing his obvious sexism and took away your ability to fully consent to living with him by omitting key info.  Bro needs to go.", "Perfectly played. NTA, but a total Champ! There's nothing like an AH getting exactly what they asked for.", "NTA, but you can do better than this relationship.", "NTA.  Why are you still with this asshole?", "NTA.  You can teach an old a new trick, but it sounds like it\u2019s better just to get a new one.  If he really was planning on you doing everything while paying 50/50\u2026 he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s got your interest in mind.", "I assume you're not on the lease? Ditch his ass, let him starve :) \n\nSeriously though, your bf needs to grow up a lot and it's not gonna be with you. The fact that you even wonder if YOU'RE the asshole when you're so obviously in the right is kind of unhealthy though... maybe therapy wouldn't be the worst idea.", "NTA. How convenient that his belief in traditional values extends as far as the woman bearing 100% of the household duties but stops before him bearing 100% of the financial cost. \n\nI would seriously consider if you want to be with someone like him.", "NTA... but seriously, move out he's a fool.", "NTA. What you describe is like the plot of an episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" Sexist role expectations in conflict with the reality of what that really  means. However, your life is not a sitcom. This man is showing you who he really is: a chauvinist who wants you to live in domestic servitude while still giving half of your disposable income to the household expenses.\n\nWhat, may I ask, are you getting out of this relationship? It seems he may have asked you  to move in to improve his living situation, not out any motives of romance or to foster a genuine partnership.\n\nYour bf is an adult; it won't kill him to go hungry if he can't figure out a way to feed himself. You want a partner, not a parasite or a charity case.\n\nDTMFA.", "NTA\n\nBut when someone shows you who they really are...believe them.\n\nThis is who your boyfriend really is.", "LMAOO \n\nNTA \n\nI love how you took his energy and threw it back at him.

It's okay to let this ~~one~~ guy go.\n\nStay together with this guy and not only will you be working full time, taking care of the house (you KNOW he's going to slack off on this. He maneuvered you in to his house in order to be the maid) AND raising the children.\n\nEdit: for clarity", "NTA\n\nYou are my hero!!! Excellent response to an idiotic position. \n\nThat said, this is a ginormous red flag for the relationship. He's either being truthful in the \"traditional roles\" thing (which means you'll be his indentured servant for life) OR he's a sneaky, lazy, cheapskate bastard who used the argument to get himself a free ride. Either way, not marriage material. Go find someone who deserves a hero!", "Haha that\u2019s awesome. NTA. But you don\u2019t want to have this same argument every other month for the rest of your life. Dump him and find a real partner.", "Save yourself time writing this out and just leave lol. He's just a bf. Not your husband. Don't take that shit", ">judging his believes\n\nHow *dare* you judge him for his belief that you're his subordinate. How rude of you to think bad of him for thinking so little of you. /S NTA.", "Wow this man would really go hungry rather than wash a dish.\n\nNTA but there's no future. Break up and move on out.", "He sounds INSUFFERABLE. How can you be with someone like that??\n\n(runs off screaming)", "Hahaha hahaha. I love your level of petty. Seriously. Fantastic work. \n\nNTA. Of course, you really do need to break up with the guy. I don't know if you're trapped in a lease with him. If so, only do 50 percent of the chores AND bring over other guys to hang out with. I'm not saying to sleep with them or anything. Just having them over will drive him nuts.", "I love when guys want to hide behind \"traditional roles \". Ok Big Daddy, that means I get to be one of the Ladies who Lunch, and spend lots of time and $$ relaxing, staying in shape, getting my hair and nails done, and managing the domestic help you bring in. Cause yes, back in the Time Before Time that's how those traditional roles rocked it.\n\nOP you're so NTA. But donyou really want to FORCE him to partner 50/50? It won't end well...\n\nCrank up the music and sing Sit Still, Look Pretty at the top of your lungs as you pack your ish and move on to the life and partner you deserve.", "Nta \nHe can't have a traditional relationship if he can't afford to be a traditional man. Can't have it both ways", "NTA.\n\nYour partner is with his 1950s ideas as they suit him.", "NTA \n\nIt seems he still doesn't understand you are honoring his beliefs and isn't smart enough to join the 21st century. If his last words on the matter are his beliefs are an okay double standard, he doesn't respect you as an equal. Run and don't look back.", "NTA. You split everything, or he needs to fill his role correctly. There's no two ways about it, he needs to pick a fuckin' lane.", "NTA but why are you with him still? If he\u2019s mad you\u2019re disrespecting his beliefs you should be his servant than why is he someone you want to be with??", "NTA.  But you are my hero!  Brilliant response to his idiotic, selfish request.", "NTA, or moreso a JAM (Justified Asshole Move)\n\nBut also, girl just dump his ass.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nI'd get my butt to a therapist to find out why I would allow such treatment", "[removed]", "NTA.

He'll make you sleep in a special shed when you're menstruating next.", "NTA - so he only believes in traditional roles only when it benefits him.
