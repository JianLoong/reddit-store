My lease was up and he offered have me move in as his roommate was moving around the same time. We agreed to split the cost of everything 50/50. For context we both make decent money and roughly have the same earning, but I WFH and have no debt while he commutes and has decent amount of debt. At the beginning everything was fine, but he slowly started doing less around the house getting to the point of leaving all household chores to me, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. When I confronted him about it he said he believed in \"traditional roles\" and it was my job as the woman of the house to do these duties. I was taken aback, but quickly recovered and told him I also agreed in traditional roles and as such it was his duty to be the provider of the household, therefore, I would no longer be contributing financially. He argued that it was not what we agreed to and that would put him in a tight situation financially. I simply explained that I was following his beliefs. By the third week we ran out of groceries, he had no money, and he didn't get paid till the following Friday. He asked me to buy the gorceries so we wouldnt be left without food for the time being. I told him he needed to figure it out as i was not going to be interfering woth his role of being the provider. The next few days id go out to eat during my lunch breaks so i wouldn't eat in front of him and cave into buying him food. I finally felt bad and told him that we can either keep this arrangement of \"tradional roles\" or we can split EVERYTHING 50/50 like we originally agreed. I explained i was not ok with following tradtional roles only when it was beneficial for him. He is now upset calling me an AH for allowing him to go hungry by refusing to pull my weight financially and for judging his believes.

Wouldn't that have necessitated a series of conversations about roles and responsibilities over the past couple of years and also before you moved in? That tells me a couple of things about him that go beyond this situation:\n\n1. He sent 'the representative' for the entire time the two of you've been together.\n2. A person capable of being 'the representative' is a liar, and I shudder to think what else they will be capable of lying about.\n3. He's a hypocrite. He spouted his 'traditional' BS to manipulate you into taking care of all the household duties and he doesn't want to take on the 'traditional' role of being the provider? As you correctly pointed out, it's not really traditional when it only works for one party.\n4. If you were a stay at home partner and had no job, he'd have to figure something out in order to provide, right?\n5. Boyfriend literally cannot adult on his own. His roommate moved out, he moved you in. If the apartment was too big or costly for him alone, why not move somewhere smaller or cheaper? Instead of that, he moves you in so that he could continue his lifestyle while having the bonus of an in-house bed partner who would now cook/clean for him? Win win in his book and allowing him to live like he was still at his mama's house.\n6. He's mad and throwing a fit because you beat him at his own game.\n\nNTA. And move now...and break up with him.", "Lmao", "Perfect:)", "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this post!! \n\nPLEASE update this when you bf comes to his senses!

It's a funny story, but absurd to actually go through with. If your values don't align, they don't align.

If you stayed at home and didn\u2019t work I could understand you taking care of the bulk of the housework (not from a traditional role perspective, just that if he were working and you weren\u2019t then you could do work around the house). It sounds like he was slowly transitioning you into this role of housewife, and would he even \u201clet\u201d you work from home anymore? Would he want you to have a job other than being a housewife? Now there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a housewife and taking care of the place, but if it\u2019s not your decision as well then what he\u2019s doing is wrong. You\u2019re both working, so to me it seems fair to split the chores. I don\u2019t blame you for purposefully slacking on things to teach him a lesson, but I feel like he won\u2019t relent. His attitude seems bad, he\u2019ll probably try this again at some point.", "NTA - this is the perfect amount of petty. But girl- run from this man. This situation sucks. Save yourself!", "NTA,  he can't have his cake and afford it too. Do yourself a favor and dump him.", "NTA. I love your approach but would dump your bf as he clearly doesn\u2019t have the funds to support his traditional approach. 50/50 on cost sharing should also mean shared responsibility on household tasks.  He doesn\u2019t get to have half his costs paid and assume you\u2019ll be the live in maid that also puts out.", "NTA. You are giving him what he asked for. Keep up the good work!", "NTA\n\nHis beliefs are hypocritical and deserve to be judged.  You epicly attempted to teach him this lesson, but it looks like it didn't go through, so I don't really know what's the point in trying to be with him anyome tbh", "NTA\nPlay stupid games and win stupid prizes!", "Why are you dating this person? He is such a A  H. His beliefs? His belief that he is entitled to be lazy. Apparently everything was fine in the beginning. He didn't communicate these beliefs from the outset. Time for you to move on and find a grownup to have a relationship with.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you have to be willing to walk away when playing this game. I fully support you, as I believe the whole \u201ctraditional relationship\u201d crap is just that, crap, and he just doesn\u2019t want to do chores. But he might call your bluff and you can\u2019t give on, or he\u2019ll walk all over you.", "ESH, why are you even giving him a chance? Your being a AH to yourself. Do you really want this relationship to drag on when he is still fighting you on this ?", "NTA. A lot of women get conned into doing 90% of the work in the relationship when a partner claims to be \"traditional\". Congrats on fully leaning in.\n\nYou might also want to consider if a guy this self centered is a good choice.", "NTA this is the new 'You can't have your cake and eat it'.", "NTA. I doubt he won\u2019t try this again in the future.", "Haha, NTA. I dig the lesson, but drop this dude. He\u2019s a dishonest hypocrite and you are obviously too smart for him.

Nicely done.", "Seriously. Why do people play these games to try to teach a person a lesson? It rarely works. He stated what he wants. OP doesn\u2019t want the same thing. The end.  Stop torturing yourselves.\n\nIt sucks that he pulled the bait and switch after she moved in. But better to pull the plug now than pretending like your life is a bad sitcom.
