My parents grew up poor. Their parents lived through the Great Depression. They still understood basic food safety and hygiene. They just also overcooked and overseasoned everything because they grew up in a world where things from the grocery store weren't always super fresh. But once the food was in our house, perishables were kept in the fridge or freezer, and expired food was tossed.\n\nThat being said, food waste is a big problem, especially in the US, so it's also important to know when you really do need to toss something and when it's still fine to eat. If a date on a package says something like \"best if used by xx/xxxx\" that doesn't mean you have to throw it out the day after that date. If it says, \"sell by xx/xx\" that date is for the store, not the consumer. Learn to use your eyes and especially your nose. Expiration dates on food packaging are mostly not regulated and food is often good past that date because the producer is erring on the side of whatever will minimize lawsuits. One of the most useful things I learned was how to tell if eggs are bad. Take an egg, put it in a tall glass of cold water. If it sinks and lays down on its side, it's pretty fresh. If it sinks but stays vertical, it's still fine to eat, but it's not as fresh. If it floats, throw it out.", "Another tip related to this, or maybe one that would be useful once you get the basics sorted out:  \n\nPut a whiteboard on the fridge. When you put in leftovers or perishable open items, write it on the board with the date. Then you know how old something is, and can prioritize to eat older stuff first or throw it away once it\u2019s been too long (4-5 days is typically recommended for most items). That will help avoid food waste *and* food poisoning, because you both will know how long you\u2019ve got to eat whatever it is. \n\nYou can even have separate areas for different stuff.
