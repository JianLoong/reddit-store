And I\u2019m sorry that you are being harassed and treated in a predatory fashion by all of these people!! It\u2019s disgusting that that forum even exists in the first place.\n\nIf his reaction was to shame and blame you for being harassed by creeps, that\u2019s definitely an issue with *him*.", "Nta and red flags on him", "NTA. Okay so something kinda similar happened to me. I had a stalker at one point of my life, and would find pictures (SFW) of me from instagram and photoshop my face onto pornography photos of other women and then send them to my family and friends saying it was me. The stalker went as far to make a fake account of me on instagram with these photos and followed all the people I followed. \nI ended up deleting all my social media accounts and even went to the police who were no help. Other stuff happened, like him calling my school and making threats, to him showing up at my work parking lot and waiting for me to walk to my car. \nPeople are sick out there and I\u2019m really sorry that this happened to you, and I hope you also know you\u2019re not alone with some weirdos making posts online about you in these types of way.", "Leave this man. NTA", "NTA. Why is he willing to believe anonymous strangers over you?", "NTA.\n\nHe should definitely be your ex by now. He's an idiot if he took that at all seriously.", "NTA. I\u2019m concerned about the fact that he\u2019s believing an anonymous post over you and dismissing your need for support at this time. You should reflect on if him not believing/trusting you is a habit of his in other aspects of your relationship. \n\nI would not want to be with a partner who doesn\u2019t trust and support me. That\u2019s not to say that there shouldn\u2019t be a sit down conversation about the situation, but he handled it very poorly.", "NTA.\n\nI'm really sorry you had to go through that, being harassed online by some freaks. I know how that feels like.\n\nIt's really telling on behalf of your bf that he would believe what some strangers on a forum posted years ago, before believing you, his girlfriend who is standing right next to him. That isn't just a red flag, that's THE black flag. Not only he believes them, but he downright starts accusing you of fakin your personality? That's so messed up.\n\nThe reaction of a partner in a situation like that would be to comfort you or get angry at those weirdos. \n\nAnd again, I'm really sorry that you had to went through that, much love to you OP.", "NTA. He deserved worse, I'd say, if he couldn't even trust the personality and behavior of yours he'd personally experienced since he'd been with you. Don't be with people who can't trust you or their own experience.", "Someone let him know about, is my guess, probably an ex. Just to cause turmoil in your life...it worked", "NTA OP and I am truly sorry that your bf is so blinded by a bunch of stupid posts created with the intention to slander you. \n\nThere are red flags coming from your bf and I can promise you it will not end just there. Next time he might accuse you for cheating on him just because you get along with your male coworkers or a male boss who looks out for his staff. Or what if in the future he accuses you of other things you did not do. You deserve better OP and you need to dump that nasty man.\n\nAbout those slanderous anonymous posts, I suggest you get in touch with a local women's organisation, digital expert and a personal reputation management specialist e.g. NetReputation.com ASAP. They will help you and try to purge those horrible posts away. Those posts will continously create misunderstandings in both your personal and professional life. I may not know you at all but I believe you are a good person who should be judged for their work ethic and hardwork and you deserve better OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your bf should be supporting you through this awful thing that\u2019s happened to you, not making it about himself. He\u2019s not just an idiot, he\u2019s a loser", "NTA, you already told him you don\u2019t interact with hookup culture. And he is dumb for believing the men on the forum about you sleeping with them and him believing you cheated on him with them is crazy. He\u2019s a huge red flag if he believes all that bullshit about you from other men. Also I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with disgusting predators like those men", "NTA and your boyfriend is a giant red flag.", "NTA. So how long has he been your boyfriend? Any change he already knew this forum, and sought you out because he thought you were loose and easy to get in bed? And when he found out you\u2019re not, he pulled up this forum to complain why he didn\u2019t get any but all these other men got to have fun with you? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t trust this boyfriend anymore. How did he find the forum? He probably saw it already years ago,\u2026", "ESH,\n\nRed flags everywhere tbh. First how did your boyfriend come across this forum. That does come across as weird\n\nYou yelling and insulting him does make you an ahole here though. You\u2019re pretty vague on the argument too which doesn\u2019t help you\u2019re case. I get your be offended but it\u2019s also fair to see it from his perspective, depending how he phrased it(again you didn\u2019t mention that in post) him asking what is this? Is this true? Or what\u2019s this all about? Are all valid questions, where you can just explain the situation of what you went through in high school. And that\u2019s it done, without the need to devolving into insulting your partner, never healthy behavior for relationships.\n\nAgain, post is vague on the things I mentioned. Because if you did explain but he didn\u2019t believe you after the fact and then that led to the fighting I\u2019d lean more towards NTA.", "NTA break up with him", "Thank you so much for your kind words, I really needed to hear that. I appreciate it :)", "Fuck no anyone would do the same if they find that kind of info about their SO even if its True or false.", "That\u2019s so crazy because I had a very mentally ill stalker in high school, and he even needed to end up being removed from the school because he was so creepy/inappropriate with me. Anyway, when I saw the anonymous posts my mind immediately went to him, and now after hearing your story (thank you so much for sharing it by the way) I\u2019m really thinking there\u2019s a good possibility it was from him. \n\nAnd I\u2019m really sorry you had to deal with that, nobody should have to go through that.", "You stated the truth. OP also needs to lawyer up against whoever anonymously posted those rubbish on the forum with the intention to harm OP's reputation. Whoever did this OP, that person is a cyberbully who needs to be taken down 10 notches by the arm of the law", "I am really sorry that you are being treated this way by the people from your school/town. That is disgusting and cruel of them to do and I just want to send care to you and to say that you have *nothing* to do with them and their gross words, and you deserve to be with someone who respects that and recognizes who you are not based on the gross BS of some online weirdos.", "Hey it\u2019s okay we\u2019ve both grown from it a lot and you should definitely maybe try and do some legal action against this guy, you\u2019re not a teenager anymore so the law would take you more seriously. I hope everything goes good for you <3", "OP I have given you my input and a suggestion what you need to do with those slanderous posts. About that creepy stalker you mentioned, I suggest you get in touch with a local women's organisation and tell them your situation and hopefully they will recommend you to seek a good lawyer who will gladly take action on your behalf"]}
