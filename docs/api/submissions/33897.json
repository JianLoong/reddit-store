Meaning they had no electricity. I work at an ice cream/fast food restaurant and we did have power (for whatever reason) so everyone and their grandma showed up; I have never seen my job so excessively packed with customers. We do have rushes but nothing like this. We were also severely understaffed. It was only me, 2 managers, and my 2 other coworkers. 5 people including me were trying to manage through this horde of hungry/cold customers. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if you have no power, I understand you\u2019re cold and hungry potentially; so it makes sense to go somewhere else that has power(so you can stay warm) and food. It was like below 30 degrees outside and ice everywhere. My only problem was that we were so understaffed and overwhelmed by the amount of customers that kept flooding in; we were running out of food too, so all we could sell were salads and chicken. We had no drinks either except rootbeer or coke. Customers were upset they couldn\u2019t get a burger but that is something out of our control which was so irritating to deal with customers like that. \nWe stopped serving ice cream too because of how understaffed we were. Keep in mind, we have drive through orders and lobby orders. Eventually we closed off the lobby and only took orders through drive thru. We put a big sign on both entrances outside and inside that says \u201cDRIVE THRU ONLY, LOBBY IS CLOSED DUE TO BEING UNDERSTAFFED\u201d \nThis is where the most crazy lady I\u2019ve ever encountered comes into the picture. She clearly ignored the sign and attempted to order from the lobby but we weren\u2019t having it. I repeatedly told her we are not taking orders through the lobby and pointed to the sign. She ignores me and continues to place her order. \n\n I said\n \u201cma\u2019am I\u2019m not taking your order, the lobby is closed.

That is no way to treat a customer. Why didn't you lock the door? You have to remain professional, even when it's hard. The situation was unexpected, and people were desperate.

I'd seriously consider starvation before ever working with the general public again.  NTA", "ESH. That woman was completely out of line and acting sssooo inappropriately. No question about that.\n\nThe hard part of this is that in customer service you really need to mind your language and to some extent your actions. While I really understand how much you wanted to tell her to get the FUXK out, you should have resorted to \"It is time for you to leave. NOW.\" \n\nYou can be direct, even forceful, and/or even call on the police or security when you need to get a bad customer out of the place of business. As a customer service professional, please don't cuss at people and do not lay hands on them unless it is absolutely unavoidable.\n\nI've been working in different sorts of customer service for about 40 years. It is very, very hard when someone is acting inappropriately. Yet, it can be done. Then there no reason for your manager or anyone else to criticize you and they can leave the focus on the lousy customer.\n\nI will say it does seem like that woman really needed the \"heave-ho\" to get her out of your lobby. Sorry this type of work often sux.", "NTA - were you an AH, no. Should you have used that language, probably not but cant blame you for doing so.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole \u2026 but I would say you\u2019re in the wrong for cussing.

But You dont need to be treated like shit because youre in customer support.", "ESH, softly on your part. It totally get it though, there were times in retail where I almost did the same.\n\nOne of the biggest things you have to remember in customer service is to not stoop down to the asshole customer\u2019s level. Get a manager involved right away next time. Don\u2019t cuss them back.", "Well, you shouldn't have been cussing at her but NTA.", "Lose power.", "NTA, you had a legit reaction to being cussed at.", "You were wrong to curse at her. That said let me tell you the magic words for a pissed off customer \u201clet me go get the manager for you\u201d You are not paid enough for this shit! It is not your problem.
