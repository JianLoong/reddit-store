One of mine and my boyfriend's roommates is in the class and is autistic, and everyone knows he is autistic. We'll call him Rob. There's another girl in the study group, who isn't my friend but more of an acquaintance. We'll call her Leah.\n\nMy friend mentioned to me as we were getting ready to walk to the bus that he had plans to ask out our downstairs neighbor and asked me for advice. Leah butted in and said that he shouldn't ask out our neighbor (who she has never met) because that would make the neighbor (that again, Leah has never met) feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I told Leah that is a weird assumption to make, and that she doesn't know what she is talking about, because she doesn't know our neighbor. Rob has talked to her before, and they definitely have a rapport.\n\nLeah said that she would be very uncomfortable if a guy with special needs asked her out, because she wouldn't know how to safely turn him down. This made Rob very embarrassed. I was offended on his behalf, and I told Leah that she was worrying about nothing, because no one would want to ask her out because she is mean and judgemental. Leah said that weirdos ask her out all the time, and she was just sticking up for women, which I should be doing, but aren't because I'm a gender traitor. I said that wasn't a real thing, and she was just a self-righteous cunt.\n\nLeah stormed off after that. Rob was somewhat stunned by what I said. He said he'd never heard me use that kind of language before. Normally I never talk like that. I think I may have gone overboard. I'm glad I told off Leah, but I'm disappointed in myself for the language I used. Was I an asshole? Should I apologize to Leah for calling her a cunt even though I stand behind the rest of what I said?", "created_utc": 1681478170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lwyhq/aita_for_calling_a_classmate_a_cunt/", "score": 3022, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
