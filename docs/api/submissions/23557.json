This can be heartbreaking because you have a sweet grand baby and why on earth wouldn't they make an effort.\n\nTBH, they sound terrible. Your kiddo may be better off with them not around", "Don't be a doormat. Your kid is too young to even register another pair of relatives, but it is old enough to feel when you are sad. Two buses to force a relationship that they clearly couldn't care less about? Skip it. Focus on the people who actually love you and your kid.", "NTA....they don't care enough to see your child.  Don't burden yourself with the thought of your child not having a connection with them when clearly they don't want a relationship with her.   Don't feel guilty at all,  you can't make someone want to see your child...their loss.", "NTA - I use to make the effort for my sons other side of the family, but as soon as I stopped, they stopped. I was upset like you at first, but realize this was because of the dynamic they had with their father. I wonder how their relationship is with him compared to his sister. You can really tell who the favorite child is once grandchildren become involved.", "NTA. I'm a granny. I adore my grandkids, and I would absolutely give my life for theirs. \n\nI need to tell you this, true grandparents don't behave the way your ILs are. Grandparents are about unconditional love, reading stories, playing games and listening to the little ones. Grandparents don't play favourites. \n\nYour ILs aren't grandparents. They might be on paper but they aren't in their hearts. If THEY can't be bothered to make the effort then why should YOU.", "NTA.  Really miserable that they would make every attempt to see the new baby, but zero attempt to visit the grandbaby they already had.", "NTA. One sided relationships aren't worth it. Surround your kids with people who love them enough to spend time with them. It doesn't always have to be blood relatives.", "NTA I would do the obligatory visits on holidays and invite them over for visits/lunch once a month. If was in their area (only 15 min away?) I\u2019d also offer to stop by on occasion. If they don\u2019t seem interested then there is not much to work with.", "NTA- the people without children come to the people with the children\n(provided everyone is healthy enough and has the means)\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but the grandparents are the ones dropping the ball here.  \n\nOp, if you\u2019re so inclined you could reach out with an invitation and follow it up with \u201chas something happened that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re welcome?\u201d if it\u2019s declined.", "Nta, it\u2019s up to them to put in equal effort", "NTA.\n\n1. They are HIS parents. Why is all responsability falling on you? You can ease, go out of your way to help, etc, but it should not be the expected thing, specially if they do not pull their own weight. \n2. If they want a relationship, they can also drive to go there. Or at least chose a park at middle point so you would only have to catch a single bus. \n3. It sounds they love the idea of being grandparents more than they love their granddaughter. A person who loves being a grandparent wants their grandchild to visit. A person who loves their grandkids wants to see their child, even if it means they are the ones visiting and not the ones being visited. \n4. If they haven't seen them in months despite them being able to go there within 15 minutes, then it may be better for your child to not form a deep attachment to people who do not care enough about her to inconvenience themselves", "NTA.\n\nThey need to make an effort if they want a relationship with their grandchild.", "You have done your best OP. Enjoy the quiet time with your daughter not hussling on the bus! NTA", "NTA. If they want a relationship with your child, they can put the effort in.  The fact that they haven't is really very telling.  But, I get it where you're coming from.  My ILs live abroad.  They've been back to our home country plenty.  They see my SIL's children, but never ours.  In all the time they've lived abroad, we've seen them 3 times in 11 years.  They see my SIL and her children multiple times a year for lengthy period.  I've given up being arsed about it.", "NTA", "Info: you aren\u2019t making the effort but is your boyfriend able to take her on his days out without you?

It seems like you're all getting what you want and no one even said/implied you were an asshole.", "I think some grandparents nowadays are \u201cdone with children\u201d. I feel like the attitude is been there done that. Not everyone is a kiddie person or enjoys the company of children, I wouldn\u2019t take it personally. You are not in the wrong not making that long journey. My own mother lives 10 minute drive from me and has visited me at home 3 times in the last 8 years - I do not take it personally. I wouldn\u2019t worry about this impacting your daughters relationship with them - family are always family and if they are not to bothered about seeing her then she isn\u2019t missing out.", "NTA. It's not your job to hold up both ends of this relationship. You can try to invite them to visit at your house, that way they can't blame you, but it's a two way street and it sounds like you are doing all the work.\n\nFYI, my kids have one set of grandparents who are exactly like this. They are now 13 and 16 and have figured out on their own that that side of the family doesn't prioritize visiting. They are 10 hours away and I refuse to use our vacation time to visit them every year, so they see us when they see us. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA, they have the car, the easier way to go places and they don't come see you but managed to see other grandchild.
