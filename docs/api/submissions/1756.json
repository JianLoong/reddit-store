We agreed on a hotel that I fronted the money for.

This was totally my mistake that I did not realize until later.

I backed out of this trip because of a medical issue but still paid my share for the hotel.\n\nTwo months later, bridal shower planning: one of the BMs asked if I could rent a large throne for $400 while the other BMs got cheaper supplies. I agreed with the mother of the bride that we were not getting the throne and I stated that. The next day, I got a text from a BM saying I overcharged them for the bachelorette. I thought it was an error with our hotel and that our price changed but upon more research, I realized the screenshot I sent was from one of the other bookings we were considering (my mistake from earlier). I told them this and admitted my mistake in sending that screenshot but the cost was actually the advertised price.

Another wanted to know where all the money went. I wasn't sure what to say anymore as it's 4 on 1 against me. I said I didn't like being accused of stealing money but they said they were not accusing me.\n\nI talked to my cousin. She knew the money was a concern of her BMs and asked them to wait until after the wedding to say anything.

You've been told the BMs are going to apologize for the accusation so what is left to stress about? I understand wanting to step aside but I think you could have waited for the BMs apology to decide what to do.

The whole mental health to rationalize running from very basic life functioning things like taking accountability for your part in a miscommunication and setting the record straight from your mistake strikes me as incredibly selfish and entitled, ngl.\n\nThe BMs should have asked for an explanation before shouting liar and thief at you.

You bringing your husband, child and job into it shows some real mental gymnastics. \n\nYou are not the victim, the bride is having to put up with your AH antics; especially when she said the BMs were going to apologise. \n\nThe way you have dealt with is by making the entire situation about you rather than defusing it and making amends.

The bride that knew about the situation and asked to wait until after the wedding to deal with it? That makes sense... abscond from that responsibility and let the tension build while her bridal party considers me a thief. These people are not my friends and I do not care if they apologize to me or not. \n\nThe bride asks the party to wait until after the wedding to bring this subject up. They didn't and this was the outcome. I felt it was best for myself and the bride to step aside to avoid any further issues again... for my mental health. I'll say that again, for MY mental health.

I am not a victim... I am not a victim...\"\n\nYour self-pity over your own actions and lack of communication shows a narcissism that will likely isolate you and affect future friendships.\n\nThe fact you feel the need to reply in walls of text to justify yourself to a stranger shows an immaturity and inability to take criticism.

Bottom line is that for some reason the BMs don't like you.  Who needs that mishegas.", "NTA, it sounds like the bride was just trying to pacify you, when she should have immediately been going out and handling her bridesmaids who were accusing you of theft. They were accusing you of a crime not only morally but legally. The bride should immediately have stepped in to handle them getting all riled up about this.\n\nHer just trying to tell you to let everything all calm down and have them just apologize to you isn't enough. You are right to step down, and if you aren't actually going to be seeing this extended family you should probably divest from their opinions. Because they clearly don't know you enough or care about you enough to care that a group of strangers were accusing you of theft baselessly, and the one person who had the authority to do something about it was choosing not to.\n\nYou absolutely should not set your feelings aside during a wedding, I don't know why people would be saying that because you should be going into any situation with some basic self preservation, and if you're also going to an emotional event like a wedding like your emotions should be part of why you are there.\n\nYeah sorry I'm long-winded, but you are right it was the right move to step away because the bride wasn't properly handling this situation and you didn't need to spend energy on this situation", "What?

They simply wanted an accounting of funds spent, which is something you needed to be doing anyway. \n\nYou're halfway through the wedding planning process and you were audited because you made a small error. This is normal. All you were asked to do was show your debits and credits. \n\nFrom your responses it seems like you showed them the receipts but didn't lay out the accounting of funds recieved or paid. They dont need to apologize for asking for that; especially because they dont know you. How do you expect them to inquire about proving their money is going where it should be?\n\nI think you jumped to conclusions and made a poor choice to withdraw from the wedding, but you didn't really hurt the bride with your actions. She may be upset about the situation, but you stepped away before you or the BMs caused a problem. \n\nThe BM at the beginning was TA, but I failed to connect that instance with the main issue.", "There was no overcharge", "Honestly that's going to come across as shady, especially if it's a significant difference in price to someone.
