She has 4 friends I do not know in the party. We got acquainted via text because this was at the start of the pandemic. I have an immune compromised child at home and social gatherings were limited. An errant text message was sent in our group by one BM about me not being present for the dress selection/fitting and that there was no excuse for it. I called out the BM who said it privately and she was pretty cold to me even after I explained the situation. I didn't feel very comfortable in this group after this but did what I had to do.\n\nWe booked a destination bachelorette party at the request of the bride and looked at dozens of places. We agreed on a hotel that I fronted the money for. I sent a screenshot of the cost in our group chat and when someone exclaimed it was less than the advertised price, I didn't check it or think anything of it. This was totally my mistake that I did not realize until later. I collected the money for the deposit and then for the balance after it posted to my account for the advertised price, broken out into equal payments for all of us. I backed out of this trip because of a medical issue but still paid my share for the hotel.\n\nTwo months later, bridal shower planning: one of the BMs asked if I could rent a large throne for $400 while the other BMs got cheaper supplies. I agreed with the mother of the bride that we were not getting the throne and I stated that. The next day, I got a text from a BM saying I overcharged them for the bachelorette. I thought it was an error with our hotel and that our price changed but upon more research, I realized the screenshot I sent was from one of the other bookings we were considering (my mistake from earlier). I told them this and admitted my mistake in sending that screenshot but the cost was actually the advertised price. The messages that followed were accusatory comments and questions.\n\nOne BM told me the extra money could go back to them or towards the bridal shower. Another wanted to know where all the money went. I wasn't sure what to say anymore as it's 4 on 1 against me. I said I didn't like being accused of stealing money but they said they were not accusing me.\n\nI talked to my cousin. She knew the money was a concern of her BMs and asked them to wait until after the wedding to say anything. I felt strongly enough for my mental health that stepping back as MOH would be the best option. She explained to me that her BMs understand and are going to apologize for accusing me. I still explained that I was stepping down and the bride was upset. The stress and anxiety I felt during this planning was more than I could handle. To my extended family, I am the villain. Everyone thinks you need to set your feelings aside during a wedding but my kids and my husband come first. My mental health isn\u2019t worth one day for someone else as selfish as that is.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nBecause there is some confusion, when this was brought up and I realized it was my error that caused the discrepancy, I immediately apologized. I also provided the necessary documentation and receipts to this group showing the price they paid which was the original price we agreed on. There was no extra money provided, everything collected was used to pay for the hotel.

I hope your friend understands why you're pulling out of MoH, but your family and mental health should definitely come first.", "esh. it sound very much like the bridesmaids agreed to one price based on your initial screenshot and then you charged them significantly more. they have a right to be upset. whether or not you provided updated documentetion, they didn\u2019t agree to the real price, they agreed to what you told them. you\u2019re also neglecting to mention the amount of the discrepancy and I have a feeling it was pretty significant based on your reaction. with that said, there is also a way for them to address the issue without putting the bride in the middle, or to double check what they pay and bring it up at the time of payment, not after the fact. mostly yta though, you didn\u2019t make a mistake an own up to it. you made a mistake and said tough crap you didn\u2019t agree to this price you\u2019re paying it and sTOp ACcUsInG mE oF STeeALinGgG\ud83d\ude2d", "having this same reaction.\n\nIn fact, I'm guessing the bridesmaids are being so nasty because they all overshot their budgets by agreeing to the destination bachelorette, and now they're being pissy about the money because they know they shouldn't have spent it.", "So after you sent the receipts to back up that it was a simple mistake of sending the wrong breakdown, they continued to believe that you stole from them and needed to reimburse them?\n\n Did they think you forged the documentation to prove your innocence?\n\nOr are they just some dense fucking people? \n\nDo they still think that you tried to swindle them? \n\nOr do they know believe you? \n\nWhat made them finally believe you if they do now?", "info: how big of a discrepancy are we talking here? it sounds like they DID agree to once price based on the original screenshot then paid significantly more.", "Bra. \n\nShe's said it like 20 times. They all agreed to a place and it's cost. She accidentally sent a screenshot of a cheaper place they had also been looking at. They booked the original place at the original price. She hadn't even noticed she accidentally sent the wrong screenshot of price breakdown.", "It only sounds like that if you don't actually read the OP's post or any of the comments.", "lmfao dude stop with the mental health card. your\nmental health is fine, you don\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of your. rebutting a mistake isnt owning up to it, APOLOGIZING for YOUR error is a start though, which it seems like you never did, you just went full throttle trying to make them seem like as holes for pointing out your mistake", "Still confused. Why did you have a screenshot of a lesser price?! How much is the difference between what you charged them and what they actually had to pay?", "Slow down. Reread what OP wrote. \n\n\n-They agreed on a price. \n\n-OP booked it and fronted the money. \n\n-OP accidentally sends a screenshot of a different cheaper booking they were considering.\n\n-OP takes the amount she was charged and divides it evenly. Then collects it from the bridesmaids. \n\nThey were only ever paying exactly what they needed to pay. They weren't overcharged.", "Shut up asshole. Trying to bully someone will not ease the pain from your miserable life.\n\nShe WAS a victim of their hostility and was implicitly accused of theft but got no apology even after 4 weeks of waiting. You should stop being such a bitter asshole and accept that maybe people can make a simple mistake and still be a victim in the bigger picture.\n\nYou're projecting your own narcissism in her because you are self centered and think of yourself as always right but when is proved otherwise and is out of arguments will just resort to victim blaming and trying to shame someone while being all \"How dare you send this big text explaining and justifying yourself after i attacked you! Nobody likes you and will get away\".\n\nYeah buddy, seems like you have firsthand knowledge on the matter, maybe stop being so insufferable.", "NTA.  Mistakes were made but turned out that mistakes on their part too actually righted the boat in this case.  The others sound like real assholes.  The type of assholes that I chose to not be around at a certain part of my life.  Who also are the types of assholes that I wouldn't piss on if they were on fire.  (Yes, not a productive comment but oh so true here!)\n\nYou are doing the best you can for your family.  It sounds to me like the others don't or won't do the same for their family nor do they consider you part of the extended....unless of course you try to screw over people you know which are really called enemies.\n\nWhile you did not ask for this to be solved let me propose something to you.  Reach out to the destination party place for an itemized receipt in an email and then forward it to the \"affected\" assholes.  I'd also detail out what it would have actually cost if you had not actually given them the money in your absence.\n\nI'd also look for new family to be with.  That one sounds like a bunch of toxic and entitled assholes.  You sound like a decent person who doesn't need those kind of people in your life", "NTA. Being MOH is an unappreciated gig. The BMs sound catty and probably jealous that they weren\u2019t chosen as MOH. If your cousin doesn\u2019t see that, it might be better to skip the wedding altogether and just send a nice card. But that\u2019s not even necessary at this point. Spend the day with your family that appreciates you instead.", "You have receipts don't you? Time to present them and tell all the BM's to stop behaving like bowel movements.\n\nNTA.", "INFO why couldn't you show the receipts from the hotel/airbnb/whatever you booked? Sounds like a fast way to resolve everything", "Wait this reads like timeline:\nYou sent a screenshot of a lower price\nEveryone paid you the higher correct price\nYou sent proof of receipt receipt\nAfter seeing the receipt matched the amount they sent, they accused you of getting extra money?", "Character limits only apply to the original post. You can edit new info into it though without being affected", "Yep, same. My son is bestman and we have definitely concluded that these positions of great honor (MOH/Best man/BM/GM) are so overrated and would rather just be a guest. You're basically roped into spending a lot of money for someone else's big life event....and sometime you just dont have it like that or want to make that kind of investment (mental and financial) in other people. NTA....right move and say no to future \"honors\".", "Throne proposed by BM not bride,  which seems odd, as they want to throw extra money around after trying to stiff MOH for an admin. error.", "Op states she sent copies of the receipts and even offered her bank statements and they\u2019re still being jerks about it.\n\nThe screenshot with a lesser price point was from a totally different hotel than the one the bridesmaids and bride stayed at for the bach party. Those bridesmaids knew it wasn\u2019t the same hotel and still complained.\n\nShe sent them receipts and they\u2019re still being awful to her. She offered her bank statements and they claimed \u201cthat was too aggressive\u201d. Like how is it aggressive to defend yourself from false allegations? What?\n\nOP is NTA and has done all the things, the bridesmaids just have decided to hate her because she has a immune compromised child and didn\u2019t make her entire life revolve around this wedding.", "Incorrect. We agreed on a price. I sent them a screenshot of the cost breakdown of a lesser price from a different quote accidentally and didn't realize it. Still charged them the original agreed upon, higher price. They paid, no questions asked. After the bachelorette party was when they asked about being overcharged and began accusations of me pocketing the extra money even after receipts and documentation was provided showing the original, agreed on price.", "and again, what was the discrepancy? if you\u2019re booking and taking money it\u2019s on you to\nmake sure you\u2019re giving out the right info", "read it completely. I found no mention of how large the discrepancy is. care to provide it?", "I apologized profusely for my error. Rebutting would mean I am trying to prove I did nothing wrong. I did something wrong and I apologized and owned it. And provided proof and documentation to back up that they paid me the correct amount. They also didn't point out my mistake, they accused me of keeping extra money that did not exist. Asking is one thing, but to do it after I show them the receipts is accusatory.", "THEY HAD THE RIGHT FUCKING INFORMATION.  It was one screenshot that was incorrect, breaking down the costs for a different destination.  They all paid the original, agreed upon price, for the correct destination.\n\nIt's really not that difficult.  They looked at destinations and broke down the costs of each destination.  They chose a destination, knowing the cost.  Then, she accidentally sent an incorrect screenshot (for a different destination).  The discrepancy doesn't matter, because they had agreed on the price.", "But they had the right info at some point anyway for them to have paid the correct price!!!!\nThe screenshot was a mistake that was corrected by sending the receipts \nThe size of the discrepancy is not the issue here...\nRelax", "There is NO discrepancy.  Let me slow this down for you.\n\n- OP and bridesmaids found a hotel and agreed upon a price.\n- OP sent *the wrong screenshot* of *a different hotel* <- this was OP's error\n- OP was bill *the originally agreed-upon price* and split *the originally agreed-upon price* amongst the bridesmaids, let me repeat, the price that they were charged was the price that they *originally agreed-upon*\n- ???\n- Profit?\n\nThere is NO discrepancy.  The price they paid was the price that OP was charged, split amongst the bridesmaids, and that is the price that they agreed-upon originally.  Again: NO DISCREPANCY.", "Who cares how large? Makes no difference to the story.", "She said in another comment that she showed them proof of how much she paid but they just got more upset.", "What the fuck? All she did wrong was accidentally send a wrong screenshot. You're reaching so hard.\n\nThese BMs sound like an absolute nightmare. As soon as they mentioned it she figured out what happened and sent the documents to show it was the right amount. \n\nAny individual with healthy communication would have said \" oh I thought we ended up getting it for a cheaper price?\" as soon as she said how much they had to pay. Then she would have realised her very simple mistake and explained and everyone would have said ahhh gotcha, makes sense. \n\nTake some deep breaths you're acting like she stabbed someone and then stood there smiling as they bled.", "This was my first thought. A fucking THRONE???!!??", "I added an edit to my post on this because a lot of people are asking. I did provide this information to them. Was still accused and asked where all the money went even after.", "She did. They are just being ignorant because she didn\u2019t agree to the $400 throne. The stress from irritating bridesmaids is why she pulled out of the wedding party."]}
