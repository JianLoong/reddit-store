She has 4 friends I do not know in the party. We got acquainted via text because this was at the start of the pandemic. I have an immune compromised child at home and social gatherings were limited. An errant text message was sent in our group by one BM about me not being present for the dress selection/fitting and that there was no excuse for it. I called out the BM who said it privately and she was pretty cold to me even after I explained the situation. I didn't feel very comfortable in this group after this but did what I had to do.\n\nWe booked a destination bachelorette party at the request of the bride and looked at dozens of places. We agreed on a hotel that I fronted the money for. I sent a screenshot of the cost in our group chat and when someone exclaimed it was less than the advertised price, I didn't check it or think anything of it. This was totally my mistake that I did not realize until later. I collected the money for the deposit and then for the balance after it posted to my account for the advertised price, broken out into equal payments for all of us. I backed out of this trip because of a medical issue but still paid my share for the hotel.\n\nTwo months later, bridal shower planning: one of the BMs asked if I could rent a large throne for $400 while the other BMs got cheaper supplies. I agreed with the mother of the bride that we were not getting the throne and I stated that. The next day, I got a text from a BM saying I overcharged them for the bachelorette. I thought it was an error with our hotel and that our price changed but upon more research, I realized the screenshot I sent was from one of the other bookings we were considering (my mistake from earlier). I told them this and admitted my mistake in sending that screenshot but the cost was actually the advertised price. The messages that followed were accusatory comments and questions.\n\nOne BM told me the extra money could go back to them or towards the bridal shower. Another wanted to know where all the money went. I wasn't sure what to say anymore as it's 4 on 1 against me. I said I didn't like being accused of stealing money but they said they were not accusing me.\n\nI talked to my cousin. She knew the money was a concern of her BMs and asked them to wait until after the wedding to say anything. I felt strongly enough for my mental health that stepping back as MOH would be the best option. She explained to me that her BMs understand and are going to apologize for accusing me. I still explained that I was stepping down and the bride was upset. The stress and anxiety I felt during this planning was more than I could handle. To my extended family, I am the villain. Everyone thinks you need to set your feelings aside during a wedding but my kids and my husband come first. My mental health isn\u2019t worth one day for someone else as selfish as that is.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nBecause there is some confusion, when this was brought up and I realized it was my error that caused the discrepancy, I immediately apologized. I also provided the necessary documentation and receipts to this group showing the price they paid which was the original price we agreed on. There was no extra money provided, everything collected was used to pay for the hotel. It was after this information was provided that the accusations and hostility got out of hand.\n\n*UPDATE #2*\n\nI just want to thank you for everyone's support on this. It blew up more than I expected and I appreciate everyone's view point and opinion. I am reliving this more than I thought I was going to so I am going to cease all replies and will be deleting this Reddit account after today.
