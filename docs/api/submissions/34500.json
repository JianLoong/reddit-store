What the hell? It\u2019s not like 65 is slow. The baby in the car, as well\u2026. I\u2019m sorry your guy did this, and put HIS OWN CHILD in risk of intense bodily harm, at the least, up to death! There are VERY few reasons that would make this any better, but it sounds like that wasn\u2019t the case, and he just did this on a whim. I doubt I\u2019d be able to forgive my wife doing that with my boy in the car when he was younger. No forgiveness right away, at least. I\u2019m sure over time we could do better, but I think it leave a heavy mental scar about leaving my kids in their care unsupervised anymore.", "NTA your protective parental instincts are raging!!\nToo bad he doesn\u2019t have any protective parental instincts!!", "Going 117mph with a child in the backseat is grounds for divorce in my opinion. He wasn\u2019t just speeding normally. He was intentionally playing with his and your kid\u2019s life. I would be very worried he would kill both of them in the future.", "So thats 117 mph in a 65? How old is your child?", "He doesn\u2019t care about your baby\u2019s life. Leave him.", "I\u2019m surprised he wasn\u2019t cited for child endangerment? That\u2019s crazy, I would be furious. NTA", "NTA, I wouldn't trust him driving the child if he can't acknowledge how wrong this is. I'm surprised he wasnt charged with child endangerment.", "NTA! He deserves to be in jail he obviously needs help to be doing such a careless thing!", "I would divorce him immediately!!!", "INFO: why did he do it?", "NTA. Bloody hell. I'd be the one going to jail as I got caught trying to hide his body! How dare that fucker put a child's life in danger like that.", "He deserves jail - that\u2019s an absurd speed to drive with or without a child. What a careless asshole. I would never let him drive with my kid again.", "Well...it is considered child endangerment.", "Don\u2019t let him drive with your child. I\u2019m surprised his license isn\u2019t suspended.", "Absolutely fucking not!! He should be in jail and if he somehow doesn\u2019t end up in jail you need to divorce this man and get sole custody to protect your child. He cannot be trusted not to endanger your kid\u2019s life and that should be your first and only priority", "NTA\n\nReckless endangerment", "NTA.\n\nYour husband 100% DESERVES to be in jail not only for child endangerment, but also putting other people at risk by driving so recklessly. If possible, I would even recommend testifying against him or at least finding a way to keep your child away from him.", "He was going HOW FAST? Nah, nah. Lock him up, maybe find some divorce papers while you're at it... NTA.", "He was going 52 miles over the speed limit? \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Was this part of a drug binge? Was the car insured/whose car is it/is it now impounded? How are you as a family going to pay for all of this (lost job?

It wouldn't make much of a difference at that speed but if they weren't it would be an additional charge.", "He was going almost twice the speed limit! Unless your child was vomiting blood and he was on the way to the damn hospital, or there was a bomb rigged to the engine that would go off if he went under 110 mph, there's no justification whatsoever for going that fast! He put his life in danger, he put the life of every other motorist, passenger, or pedestrian on the road that day in danger, and most importantly he put the life of your child in danger.\n\nHe *should* go to jail! NTA!!!", "going 117 when other people are around is criminal. he could have killed your kid, or someone else.", "This wasn\u2019t an accident, this was a choice. No one drives that fast by mistake. It wasn\u2019t like he was going 70 in a 65 because he was a bit distracted. The fact your kid was in the car makes it even worse - when it was as bad as it could get already. You\u2019re definitely NTA and your husband definitely is. I\u2019d never forgive him for putting lives in danger like that, including your child\u2019s and his own. I am intrigued by his reasoning though, and if this is indicative of a much deeper problem.", ">he would kill both of them in the future.\n\nNot to mention another innocent driver.", "Lol it depends on the car. 117 in a benz is like 250 in a shitty old Honda.", "This. I would absolutely divorce and also do everything in my power to make sure he wasn't left alone with the child again.
