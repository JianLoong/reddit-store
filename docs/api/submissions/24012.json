A&Es are crazy and exhausting.  IMHO, there'd be no way to do any research while you're there, in fact, I'm giggling a bit at the thought of trying to concentrate on something in the midst of chaos.\n\nFor me, it wouldn't be a question of what's more important to you, but rather, you must be prepared for the Monday meeting, and when can you do the research if you go to the wedding?  I would need a block of uninterrupted time that would be used up by getting ready, going and returning home.  I don't think you can do the wedding and the research.  If you don't go to the wedding, your mother might be upset, but not doing the research could have significant long-term effects on your career - mostly because you need to appear to be on top of things and confident.  One day in the A&E and one day at a wedding, I'd be tired and unprepared.", "Info: did you rsvp for this wedding? How long have you known about this work presentation?", "Info: how is your mother so I\u2019ll that you have to spend 10 hours at the emergency room on Saturday but still fine to attend a wedding on Sunday?\nWhy can\u2019t you do your research on Sunday morning if the wedding is in the evening?", "I'd say it depends on who's wedding it is. How close are you to this person? Did you RSVP that you were going?", "YTA\n\nIt's a soft YTA but I'm going to be blunt.  You will have known about the probation meeting for a while so its poor planning to leave all this work until the last minute.\n\nEvery probation meeting I have ever been to the decision has already been made by that point so I would be surprised if anything you say or present will make a difference.  Fingers crossed it goes well for you.  \n\nThe situation with your mum is unfortunate but these things can't be planned for and do tend to happen at the most inconvenient time.  I hope she is ok.  \n\nI expect you will also have known about the wedding well in advance too so you would have known there was a clash with your probation meeting.\n\nI don't see why you being a 24 year old female has any bearing on it.  It's just poor organisation which can affect anyone.", "YTA\n\nIt's not a function it's a wedding that you had RSVPed to and said you were going to\n\n\nAnything that you have said yes to that cancelling would cost the host money you should attend (had you been in hospital yourself at the moment of the wedding you would have been ok to cancel)", "soft YTA, because you shouldn't prioritize work over family. It seems like you are planning on doing all of this research for work during your time off, which I think you should never do. If you are doing anything work related you should make sure you are being paid for it. If anything you should ask your work to push back the meeting to next day so you can have time to prepare during work hours.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
