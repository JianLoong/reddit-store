There were so many other ways of conveying the same message is a professional way...\n\nThe head of my electric toothbrush comes with a 'stem' that's pretty long...I can't forsee how more than that stem would enter into one's mouth...I mean, if we're that pedantic about oral health, partners wouldn't kiss, share a fork, share food...", "YTA - you're over exaggerating. You make it sound like they're sharing the exact same tooth brush. Sure there may be some minor cross contamination, but one kiss is going to be far worse than anything that might be on the base of the unit. Not to mention sex.", "YTA.\n\nThey probably kiss and exchange other bodily fluids as well \ud83e\uddd0\n\nI also don't understand how toothpaste would go down the length of the toothbrush. Are people really that sloppy? I use an electric brush and never had this happen to me. Besides, if it did happen, toothbrushes can be easily rinsed off.", "YTA. There is nothing wrong with what they are doing, it's the handle not the brush heads. Handles and brush heads are easy to clean after each use and there is probably less contamination on the handle then there is if they kiss, share a utensil, etc. My dentist is fine with it, my friend who is a dental hygienist has no issue with it. You just projected your personal biases onto your patient. I highly doubt you'll have the chance decline him as a patient, more likely he'll realize how unprofessional you are and spend his dental $$ elsewhere.", "YTA. Gonna make a low blow here and say.... they may not teach bed-side manners in dental school, but usually your choice of words can make all the difference in the world. Saying its \"a little gross\" was way over the line for something that may not be the best \"hygenic\" decision. By saying \"gross\", you immediately passed your own personal judgement, and not the judgement you earned in with your actual medical degree.\n\nAnd I hope you find just as big of a germophobe to be happy with.", "YTA. They swap out the toothbrush heads. They'll contaminate themselves more by kissing each other.", "Wtf? Where I live, entire families use an electric toothbrush together (different heads, obviously). I have never heard once from any dentist that that is supposed to be bad for dental hygiene. Like, you are supposed to wash the hand piece after use anyway.\n\nJust kissing your partner or living with a toddler will give you more germs and bacteria than sharing the bottom of a toothbrush. You are not supposed to deep-throat the toothbrush, btw.\n\nAlso, don't look in disgust at your patient, I am always surprised how people with so little self restraint can become doctors when I would have been kicked from my job as a a CPS worker if I had dared to look weirdly at someone.\nAnd honestly, he was probably right. It is obvious that you are not married. What you did was to imply that his wife is disgusting. YTA.", "YTA - Seriously? Is it that big of a concern? I really don\u2019t see the problem in what the client is doing. You also decided to give him advice in something he didn\u2019t ask for. You know giving advice for something no one asked for us rude right?", "YTA.  You definitely overstepped.  \n\nYour concerns have nothing to do with dental hygiene and he didn't ask for your opinion.", "YTA.  There\u2019s really minimal germ and saliva transfer with separate heads on an electric toothbrush, unless the people using it are absurdly out of control messy.  I can understand not wanting to share one with a small child who\u2019s completely covering the whole device in slobber and toothpaste froth, but most adults are pretty tidy.  It sounds like you\u2019ve got a personal issue there and projected it onto your patient, which is obviously inappropriate", "YTA\n\nYou do realise that one of the benefits of an electric toothbrush is that you can switch the heads\u2026 meaning multiple people can use it without spreading germs\u2026 right?\n\nThis is such a normal practice for people who live together\u2026", "YTA\n\nIt's not a regular toothbrush, they use separate heads. There's nothing that gets into the electric portion of the tootbrush from the head because the head is sealed water tight.\n\nYou can give medical reasons about not sharing the same regular tootbrush, or sharing the same head for the electric one, but what you're doing here is plain bigotry with no actual medical reason at all. More germs get transferred in a quick kiss than through this way. And people do kiss each other, you know?", "YTA. Wait till you learn what kissing does... And the whole oral sex thing is going to break your brain...", "YTA. You judge a patient!!!  You called their behavior \u201cgross\u201d.

What an out of touch expectation to have if other people\u2019s finances!!!", "YTA. Not very professional concuct either. Glad you're not my dentist.", "YTA. Unprofessional and childish. You can give advice without that.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with trying to educate him, that's part of your job, it's the way you did it. \n\nHonestly you really shouldn't have to ask us if you were inappropriate. Yes he probably overreacted but you are the professional (supposedly) and you started it; you should have apologized immediately .\n\nLastly Reddit isn't really the best place to get professional advice.

Not because of your POV - since you\u2019re not married / have not lived with a S/O long term it\u2019s understandable you don\u2019t get where they\u2019re coming from. But because of your \u201cbedside manner\u201d and language when speaking with your patient. Saying that sharing an electric toothbrush base is \u201cgross\u201d sounds way more judgmental than saying that it is \u201cunsanitary\u201d (IMO). Food for thought if this comes up again. \n\nFor reference, When I was growing up my brother and I shared an electric toothbrush (sonicaire) base but had different heads (obv) because they were new-er to the market and not cheap; we also didn\u2019t have a ton of money. My wife and I practice the same thing because again, having two bases is unnecessary.", "YTA. \n\nYou used unprofessional and judgmental wording. Why wouldn\u2019t a \u201cJust make sure you wash the handle after each use\u201d suffice?

That doesn't sound professional at all and certainly will not make him to change his hygiene routine. Also it's quite common for couples to share a electric toothbrush with separate heads.", "YTA and I almost cant believe you are a dentist! You overstepped the doctor patient boundaries and provided unprofessional personal opinion without any medical reasons (because they likely don't exsist) . I would not be surprised if you lost a patient.", "YTA. You\u2019re wildly unprofessional for someone in the medical profession.", "YTA You are a professionell. And you use the word \"it is gross\" for something so simple?! And how do you use a toothbrush that everything gets on the handle?", "YTA because its really none of your business if its gross or not. i also dont know why the saliva would matter between a married couple? like. its unprofessional and tbh i would feel really shit if a medical professional was saying i was gross for habits that dont impact my health at all.", "YTA, and extremely unprofessional.\n\nYou do realize that the base of the electric toothbrush can be quite easily rinsed off between uses, yes? There\u2019s no residue of saliva or toothpaste on the base if adults make a minimal effort at hygiene. I mean, it\u2019s not surgically sterile or anything, but what is? Do you think people rinse their mouths with Betadine before they kiss?", "YTA. Nice bedside manner", "They are only sharing the handle of the toothbrush, which is easy to clean between uses, you seem to be deliberately exaggerating in your title.

You should've kept that *personal comment* to yourself and provided only professional advice.\n\nThe patient on the other hand must have known that a dentist knows better about oral hygiene than him and should not have argued.

Regardless of whether you\u2019re right in saying that this is risky (as other commenters have pointed out, they\u2019re regularly exchanging bodily fluids as a married couple), a basic tenet of being a good medical provider is not showing judgment toward your patients. Frankly, you aren\u2019t as good of a dentist as you think you are if your patients have to fear that you\u2019ll shame them for discussing their dental hygiene with you. You owe the patient an apology and you should do some reading and reflection on non-judgmental care.", "NTA \n\nDefinitely could\u2019ve been more professional about it.

Switching out heads is cool in theory but it\u2019s way too easy to get identical pieces mixed up. How you even know you using the right one? And I live with my boyfriend btw, I would never do this. I don\u2019t even like our toothbrushes to touch. It\u2019s one thing to kiss and even do whatever you do with the bodily fluids but I\u2019m not sticking my tongue in his mouth trying to taste his last meal or scrub his tongue.

As a dentist, it is your duty to inform your patients of the best practices for maintaining their oral health. \n\nHowever, it is understandable that the patient might have been offended, as it is a sensitive topic and personal choice. In the future, you can try to approach the topic with more sensitivity and tact, while still conveying the importance of proper dental hygiene practices. It's up to you whether or not you want to apologize to the patient or continue treating him as a patient.\n\nFor now, how you handled the situation was very unprofessional.

Less levels of sanitation preference is at the patient's risk. And we don't know the medical history of the patient as well as OP does. I see nothing wrong with the advice, just the manner it was delivered.", "Apart from what I mentioned earlier that we on reddit have no idea how healthy the patient's mouth is, OP does, current and past records, there's also a reason why doctors advise one shouldn't engage in oral sex immediately after brushing.
