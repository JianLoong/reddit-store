My moms (49F) 50th birthday is on April 12th and she recently announced her party will be on the 15th as well. I asked my mom why she couldn\u2019t have her party the weekend before and she said because that\u2019s when my nieces 3rd birthday party is. I asked why she couldn\u2019t have it the weekend after and she said that she will be busy and there\u2019s no point in having it two weeks after because that\u2019s too far away. She also said she can\u2019t have it on Friday because it\u2019s not convenient. Her party will be starting at 6 which really means she will be busy from 2 pm going forward as she has to set up, get the party ready, etc. I didn\u2019t want to have my daughters party super early because that also isn\u2019t convenient for the majority of my family who work late. My dad, sister, and I all work late nights so I know everyone likes to sleep in a little on the weekend. I wanted to get sweets and different foods for my daughters party and be able to spend the day with her and my family and really focus on her because it\u2019s her first birthday and I know she won\u2019t remember but I will. I bought her party decorations months in advance, have had the theme picked out, and honestly just excited for it for months. I never had big parties when I was young so I guess I just wanted to go all out for my daughter and have her birthday be all about her. To top it off my mom is hosting the party at a bar and asked me to find a babysitter for my daughter but I want to be with her on her birthday and spoil her all day. I feel like everyone is going to be rushed at her party because they have to get ready for my moms and my mom doesn\u2019t live super close and the bar is a bit of a drive from where the rest of us live. Not sure if im being sensitive but I told my mom im not happy that she\u2019s doing this on my daughters birthday and it\u2019s honestly stupid. She got mad at me and told me im being an AH.

For a 1 year old it literally doesn't matter!

So, best case, OP gets 2 hours of actual family time.\n\nThen let's add in that many adults use the weekends to get errands done.

Taking away the moms 50th to give the daughter (not even the granddaughter) a memory for their child's first birthday is not equal.

Why not celebrate together then let Gma have the after party at the bar?\n\nI say this as someone who's joined a family where there is an important uncle who's birthday is on the same day as mine.

Her words not mine.", "I hope that someone can talk some sense into her. She is missing out on having a better birthday experience by not realizing even her daughters think it\u2019s a stretch to attend. \n\n\nMaybe she could go for the idea of a separate party day if the three of you came together and threw her a proper party. You could talk her into it that it isn\u2019t rushing anyone from one party to another or to drive a ways out. It would allow her grand children to be there, etc. I could see such an endeavor would be a financial drain and time consuming, but it could be where your mom sees there is a better route available than a bar excursion that excludes people from going or staying long.", "So a lot of older people never had a birthday party for a variety of reseasons. There may be a good reason she is overprotective of her birthday and maybe just ask her?", "Thank you so much :)", "Do yourself and OP a favor and read some of OP\u2019s comments.

The second group has some characteristics of the former, but do not meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis.\n\nThis may well be the one example of these tendencies; nevertheless, never throwing your child a party during her childhood while renting a bar for your own is not great. The fact that she knowingly did this on her grandchild\u2019s birthday in addition? She doesn\u2019t want to be there, is creating unnecessary drama, and by nature of the events occurring back to back, will force people to choose between the two or leave early. That is incredibly self centered.", "If you mean same theme, well of course. Nothing is new. Humans are creatures of habits. \n\nIf you mean this exact post, then why are you even engaging with it and OP at all?

These things are irreplaceable.\n\nShe knew the date in advance and doesn't want to have her party on her niece's birthday. You've verbally told your mother and communicated your issues and your mother has responded with I don't care.

Or given you less, taken away things, or had any attempts at taking the spotlight from you to put on herself?", "ESH. I will never truly understand the people who make big parties out with months in advance of planning for turning 1. It is entirely for you, and honestly could be any day around her birthday, she won\u2019t know the difference. If you waited until the next weekend she wouldn\u2019t know or care. I think you\u2019re also being fussy about wanting to spoil her all day and being upset it\u2019s at a bar so she can\u2019t go. Once again, she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s her birthday. That being said, your mom planned an event on the same day a distance away and inviting the same people as you. She could have done it on the Sunday, or the Sunday prior. One of the days wasn\u2019t the niece\u2019s party. I don\u2019t think she should have to give up her 50th party and I don\u2019t think you should have to give up your daughter\u2019s 1st.

All the family that would will be at her party, any other regular one is \u201cbusy.\u201d Give her a gift and then spend the rest of the evening with your daughter like you wanted to. You\u2019ll probably have quite a bit of cleaning up to do anyways.", "Eh. Honestly you are taking away 50 from your mom which is huge to her. You can\u2019t suggest she switch days when you can very much so do the same. Especially for a 1 year old. I had my nephew\u2019s first birthday on Easter when I had other plans, and my sister made it last all day. He slept through his whole party and cried at the cake. I don\u2019t think this is a hill you want to die on.", ">\nEven so, just do what you were gonna do. You're both adults.\n\nTrue, but planning a party on a date you know has been reserved for a close family members birthday definatally makes you an AH.\n\n If you read OP's post  you know she propably hasn't shut up about it for months. Perhabs she moderates herself or perhabs she was annoying, but the date had been reserved.

The kid is not going to remember anything. The mom will. The first year is very hard and it\u2019s a very big deal for the mom and a great celebration. No one is asking the grandma not to celebrate her 50th. Except her birthday is on the 12th and not the 15th. The fact that she would choose the same day as her grandchild\u2019s first birthday knowing full well that her daughter has been planning it for months says everything about her.", "And somehow having a party 3 hours after the baby's party is scheduled to end is ridiculous and makes her an AH?", "3 year olds stand a distinct chance of forming cohesive memories at their birthday party and understanding the celebration for their birthday.

First birthdays are special even though the toddler won\u2019t remember, but you will. You sound like the kind of person who would have guilt if you didn\u2019t celebrate your child\u2019s 1st birthday and that would be understandable. As a mother myself I would would put my child first. If my mother were still alive I know she\u2019d never do this to her grandchildren, but everyone is different. Personally I hate aging and I hate attention/fuss so it\u2019s hard for me to put myself in your mothers shoes. Because of my mothers passing and my own pregnancy loses I see my time with my children the most important time I have. It is totally understandable for you to want to spend time with your daughter on her actual birthday which is 3 days after your mothers actual birthday. Your mother telling you to find a baby sitter doesn\u2019t sit well with me to be honest.\n\nEdit NTA", "50 is a big birthday. Presumably you know when your mum\u2019s birthday is, so why wasn\u2019t this discussed when you first started planning the party for the little one? You could have moved it to the Sunday then, for example. Personally I think a milestone birthday for someone who will remember it is more important than a birthday for someone who won\u2019t, and I\u2019d never celebrate my birthday early (it\u2019s unlucky where I\u2019m from). NAH but you could all work on your communication.", "Op while your mom has a right to celebrate her 50th I was shocked she cared more about her nieces 3rd then her granddaughters 1st!
