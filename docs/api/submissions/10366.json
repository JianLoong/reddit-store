Her: I have a big camper parked on my driveway and it takes up a lot of space. There isn\u2019t enough space to park my car.  Me: ok, you need to figure something out because you can\u2019t park your car on our driveway anymore. It\u2019s rude, and you\u2019ve already been told to stop. If you do it one more time, I\u2019ll have your car towed.  She apologized to me and promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again. \n\nLast night, my husband and I went out for dinner.

Though, I do wonder, where is she moving the car to when you asks her to leave and why the hell doesn\u2019t she just park there in the first place?", "This and more.  Some people don't learn if there aren't real-world repercussions to their crappy,  entitled behavior.  Of course, some people never learn and double down on their bad attitude.  However,  I bet she doesn't park in OP's driveway anymore.  \n\nThat said, if the neighbor is that big of an AH, keep an eye out.  She sounds like the kind of person to retaliate. \n\nOp you are definitely NTA", "Even if it is your own drive way? NTA, but I think either one are allowed to use their space as they wish to. I do think it is super rude to use anyones private space without asking.", "Wow.  This is a brilliant observation. \n\nReasonable people totally don't understand narcissists who will take everything they can, until they can't, and then still claim to be the victim.\n\nOP needs to be wary about retaliation. \n\nCameras are a good idea.", "NTA but disagree, the neighbor clearly started the war by attempting to forcibly claim part of OP's property.  Sometimes war comes to you, however considerate or deferential you may be - OP did nothing even remotely aggressive here, and if the neighbor does anything at all I'd be contacting the police to have her trespassed.", "Put up cameras", ">Even if it is your own drive way?\n\nYup.  In my area you can't park any type of RV, or trailer in your driveway for more than 24 hours unless you have a permit that is only good for 72 hours.  This ordinance came about because certain assholes in the neighborhood were hosting parties out of their campers and causing a ton of problems.  One of those neighbors had a police scanner and if a noise complaint was called in, they'd pack up the party and move before the police got there.", "It's one of those \"please don't make the neighborhood look trashy\" laws. Just like you can't let your grass get to a certain height.", "I was ready for an argument until I realized you actually thought it was a good observation and weren\u2019t being /s with me! :-)", "Hopefully, OP gets security cams or has some set up already. If neighbor is that much of an AH then I wouldn\u2019t put it pass them to be petty.", "I understand they didn\u2019t ask for it and I see your perspective and this is accurate the neighbor brought it to them. This approach of calling the police works in a vacuum. Neighbors can also escalate outside what would be considered illegal, I\u2019ve seen it many times. Let\u2019s go down the rabbit hole of calling the police. You\u2019ve now escalated further. Neighbors can do a lot that can hurt you financially. For example say the OP decides to sell their property and neighbor knows that. Neighbor can devalue your property simply by legally making their property in such close proximity so undesirable that it lowers the value of your property and either no one buys or you get lower offers because the house appears to be in a less than desirable neighborhood. Resolving the conflict without escalation typically leads to the best outcome. I think OP was certainly justified with the towing, but where does the neighbor fight end? A way you could approach this is make the neighborhood into a community with a minimal HOA and establish rules and fines for things like campers. My point is there are lots of potential conflict resolution techniques without straight escalation as you\u2019ve suggested. This is where Reddit goes scorched earth in their opinion which isn\u2019t an incorrect one, but doesn\u2019t play out in a perfect victor/loser scenario.", "Ah I've read things like this before. It isn't really a thing where I am from. You cannot park an RV in a public parking spot for more than a day, because of parking space issues. But you can do whatever to your own house/garden/drive way.", "No way HOA. Town ordinance about parking RVs sure. There is rarely an instance where a \" minimal\" HOA doesn't eventually morph into a giant PIA.", "Agree they certainly do/can. It was just a possible example of a round about way to get the collective neighborhood on the same page which results in not just you vs one crappy neighbor, but the neighborhood against the crappy neighbor. Also much easier than getting an ordinance passed. HOAs that are run well are just an attempt to establish rules that are clear cut to solidify the look and feel of a neighborhood. Not everyone likes them, but I\u2019ve been in plenty that weren\u2019t PIA. If run correctly they also protect the value of the homes within the neighborhood from a rogue neighbor erecting a 50ft flag pole flying whatever flag they chose right next door (real thing I have seen)."]}
