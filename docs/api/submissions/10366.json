He asked her to move her car and told her she can\u2019t do that anymore because it\u2019s not her house. He said he was polite about it, and she apologized and moved her car. \n\nThe day after that, I saw Lindsay\u2019s car parked on my drive way again after I got home from my doctors appointment and my husband was working. I decided to ask her what\u2019s going. Her: what do you mean? Me: you keep on parking your car on our drive way after we\u2019ve asked you nicely not to do that. Why do you keep doing it? Her: I have a big camper parked on my driveway and it takes up a lot of space. There isn\u2019t enough space to park my car.  Me: ok, you need to figure something out because you can\u2019t park your car on our driveway anymore. It\u2019s rude, and you\u2019ve already been told to stop. If you do it one more time, I\u2019ll have your car towed.  She apologized to me and promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again. \n\nLast night, my husband and I went out for dinner. When we got back home, we saw Lindsay\u2019s car parked on our driveway. I told my husband that was it! Enough is enough! I\u2019m going to tow her car because she\u2019s been warned. We\u2019ve tried asking her nicely, and she doesn\u2019t want to listen to us. My husband agreed, and I towed her car right away. I also stuck her with the bill because it\u2019s her own fault. Now, she is calling me an asshole and she\u2019s pissed at me.\n\nEdit: she left a not in my mailbox. She called be a drama queen and she wants to be repaid for the tow bill because it was my idea to tow her car instead of acting like an adult and asking her to move it. If I don\u2019t repay her, she will park her car in my driveway again because I\u2019m being petty.  Lmao! I\u2019ll tow her car again!

Obviously the likelihood exists she's just a narcissist, but I found in personal experience they almost play stupid finding a workaround to push your boundaries. Don't disagree the car should've been towed. That's wildly disrespectful, only saying if you are like me, and have to judge conversations on scales of effectiveness, respectfulness, and usefulness. Along the way I figured out I accepted a lot of disrespect because although I brought things to a conversation, I would allow someone like the brat to play dumb knowing they even knew that I KNEW the were full of shit.

When dad went to work, people used to think our driveway was public parking and constantly kept parking there. My dad always asked nicely for them to move and not to do it again but it kept happening and we'd see the same few people doing it. It didn't make sense because all the houses around us had plenty of driveway space and there was a church and dentist across the street that they could possibly park at but they constantly used our driveway even after we put signs up saying it wasn't public parking and that violators would be towed. Finally one day my dad had a bad day at work and came home to someone in his spot yet again and he didn't even bother to find out who's car it was, he just called the tow truck and had it hauled away. The owner of the car ended up coming when the tow truck was hooking the car up but at that point its too late unless you have the money to pay the driver then and there. Otherwise he cant unhook the car until he gets back to the shop. He ended up having to go down to the auto shop and pay the tow bill plus a storage fee to get his car back.

If you dial 911 with a non-emergency you've lowered your chances at getting help with a non-urgent issue. \n\nI've found that calling the non-emergency number does get results for things like physical altercations, noise violations (it has to be VERY bad for me to call, which I've done only 3x after living in a very loud area for 18 years) and when the patients at the halfway house building across the street get into arguments that seem to have the possibility of escalating, for which the social workers are always grateful.", "Ooh, cameras! That's a brilliant idea! As soon as the notification comes in, call for the tow. I'd pay to watch her try to figure out how you saw it before she had a chance to move it.", "Amen. But OPs neighbor is a committed jackass, so they can't be too careful.", "its really not", "wdym physical altercation? Shouldn't that just be labeled as assault? \n\nUnless it's like a dick measuring contest where the participants are just shoving each other.", "There are rules where we are.

Those things aren't cheap to maintain.", "Tough shit. If you can\u2019t afford to store it then you can\u2019t actually afford an RV.", "I'm not sure we are talking about the same kind of trailer? The kind you tow behind your car and load things on? \n\nI could see that argument for the RV, but trailers are just a common and useful car accessory.", "Oh yeah, we definitely aren't. I was picturing like, the things that are like RVs, but instead of being self-driving they have to be towed. [Like this](https://www.minneapolistrailer.com/images/14630691-0-95779171.png) .", "Ooooh. Yes those and RVs are expensive to maintain for sure.", "NTA - keep towing her. Heck, ask if there's any criminal charges you could file like trespassing.

FAFO.", "NTA and I love her note!\n\n\"If you don't pay for the tow I'll park there again!\"\n\nAaaaand you'll get towed again. Don't you threaten me with a good time!", "NTA. She is trespassing on your property. You have every right to tow it and you don't have to pay for shit.", "NTA, what a clear cut case of fucking around and finding out.", "NTA. Send her a note in her mailbox and tell her she will be towed again.", "NTA. At all. Tow it. And then tow it again. It\u2019s trespassing at this point.", "NTA. Unless she is paying you rental fees for parking on your lot she has not right to park there. Keep towing it.", "NTA. The camper isn\u2019t your problem. She\u2019s been asked nicely and warned. She needs to pay the bill, apologize, and make other accommodations for her car.", "NTA here. She had three warnings already.", "Absolutely NTA. She was rude enough to do it more than once after being asked not to, then she did it after being warned that you\u2019d tow the car. She\u2019s both an asshole and an idiot.", "NTA\n\nYou should tell her towing it was the nice option, I would parked it in and refused to move for a week or so.", "NTA   Have it towed everytime!", "NTA.

Sometimes they can require you post a sign. Don\u2019t want her to pursue you in small claims and wind up on the hook for the cost of the tows", "NTA whatsoever, but I'd make sure you have cameras outside because someone that blatantly stupid and entitled is likely to try to retaliate and damage your property.", "The edit makes it better.   NTA.   Her camper is not your problem.", "NTA.  Y'all are generous with three warnings", "NTA keep towing her car. Soon the bill will out way the stupid.", ">Lmao! I\u2019ll tow her car again! I dare her!\n\nI hope you do!! Imagine being that entitled & obtuse.\n\nNTA", "Lolol NTA 100%.\n\nOk, jerk? You wanna play? I can have you towed every day. What are you going to do except stop parking there and be more mad about it?\n\nIf you don\u2019t tow her each time I will be disappointed in you as a person ;) \n\nLolol please give an update also", "NTA Lolol please let us know if she does it again! This is kinda stupid and funny", "NTA - you did ask her to move it multiple times!\n\nShe FAFO - sucks to be Lindsay.", "NTA. You gave her fair warning you'd tow her, and she thought she was calling your bluff; it's her own problem you weren't bluffing.", "NTA. I mean, she keeps on promising not to do it again, and then doing it. I don't see what other option you had.", "NTA and I think your response is appropriate. I would even go so far as to not drive all the way home so she doesn't see you in case she is watching. Also call an out of town tow truck.", "NTA!", "NTA\n\nSounds like Lindsay is going to get some tow bills again in the future.\n\nKeep towing her. She'll eventually figure out where HER driveway is.", "i somehow read this as \u201cthrowing my neighbor\u2019s cat\u201d and was so thoroughly confused", "NTA\n\nWell if it isn\u2019t the consequences of Lindsey\u2019s actions\u2026.", "NTA. why do humanity going backwards??????", ">If I don\u2019t repay her, she will park her car in my driveway again\n\nSounds an awful lot like someone who likes the tow driver. Help those two lovebirds meet again. \n\nNTA", "NTA. And time to contact police (non-emergency) and tell them she\u2019s constantly trespassing.", "NTA You asked her not to do it and she doesn't listen, so you get towed.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. This kinda thing irks me to no end. My neighbors do it too, and I have a hard time pulling into my driveway as a result.", "NTA. Lindsay needs to widen her driveway or figure something out. But she doesn\u2019t get a free parking spot out of you.", "Please keep us updated if she parks there again! Lol NTA.", "Lol found out", "Yes, you are the asshole for towing your neighbor's car without warning her before doing so. While you did warn her not to park on your driveway again, you did not tell her that you would tow her car if she did so. It is understandable that you do not want her to park on your property, but there are better ways to handle the situation.\r  \n\r  \nYou could have talked to her again after the second incident and made it clear that if she parked on your driveway again, you would tow her car. If she continued to park there after being warned, then you would be justified in having the car towed.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, sticking her with the tow bill is not fair. You made the decision to tow her car, so you should be responsible for the cost.\r  \n\r  \nIt is not productive to escalate the situation by towing her car again or engaging in a tit-for-tat exchange. Instead, try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her to find a solution that works for both of you.", "I'd keep that note, send her one certified mail telling her to stay off my property.  Install cameras.  Then, not only tow her car, have her charged with trespassing.  Every time.  Eventually,  she'll lose her job by going to jail or she'll not be able to get her car back over and over and she won't have a ride to work.  Then, she won't be able to pay for her housing and she'll move", "And opening someone else's mailbox is a crime.", "Do you not have reading comprehension? Read her post again.", "I did warn her about towing her car. It\u2019s fair to stick her with the bill because she didn\u2019t listen. I\u2019m not going to be nice to her anymore because nice isn\u2019t working.", "NTA. She was told to move her car 3 times, and warned that she\u2019d be towed if she did it again.", "My mom's neighbors had permission to park on one side of her driveway, in front of the side of the garage that never got opened, and even behind her car with notice when all their kids cam home for holidays. She lived somewhere with super strict HOA rules about not parking on the grass and no long term street parking.\n\nIn exchange they took her trash bins up to the street for her and brought them back down, which was helpful as the drive had an incline and mom was 60+ with a chronic pain condition. They also really helped out when she suddenly started displaying dementia symptoms and I lived out of state.", "Don't forget to add violators will be towed", "Really? Huh, TIL", "Grabbing popcorn as I type this", "Begone bot", "I did that to a neighbor a few years ago. I live in an apartment complex and this woman kept parking in front of the fire hydrant even when there were plenty of other spaces just because she didn't want to walk. I'd notified the complex manager and they'd talked to her about it multiple times. They gave me the non emergency number for our local police and told me to feel free to call if I saw her do it again. I had to run a quick errand one evening and her car was there again so I called. When I got back the police were there writing a ticket. She finally stopped after that.", "You're supposed to ask for INFO if and only your judgement **needs** that information. Since it's irrelevant, you got down voted", "Ironically, the non emergency number in my area routes through the 911 dispatchers. So at this point, I just make a point to clarify this isnt an emergency, so if you have to put me on hold for a real one, thats fine.", "That sounds odd and easily fixable, like they should want to fix it? \n\nThough when I lived in Brighton in the 90s we were on the town line of Brookline and the one time I had to call 911 I got Brookline Emergency and they sounded annoyed and told me to hang up and call this other number to get Brighton Emergency so I'm scrambling for a pen. Thankfully that was just for a fender bender. \n\nBut it seemed so dangerous that I complained about it to everyone I could think of because it was a disaster waiting to happen, like police and fire in both towns, and I even wrote to the Globe and the Herald but no one picked it  up. No one returned my call. \n\nNot even a year later I woke up at 3 am to my roommate shrieking to come see what's on her TV and CNN was in front of our building filming. An Irish guy who'd been deported and snuck back in (for the 3rd or 4th time), and who'd beaten his gf into a coma years before, had gotten into the foyer of the bldng across the street and waited till his victim ex gf came to pick up her mail and he shot her and then himself.\\*\n\nSo everyone was calling 911 and getting told the same thing I'd been told and that made the front page news for days because it delayed the response and tenants were running outside to see what was happening, while still other tenants were coming home late and having to see this bloody foyer and the bodies and no one knew if there was still a gunman around bc they didn't know it was murder-suicide.  \n\n\\*The woman had been in a coma for many months with a lot of broken bones and damage. He managed to leave the country as he has his ways since he'd been forcibly legally deported for other times he'd beat her. She was so terrified that she rented an apartment in like Waltham and kept the Sunderland Road address just to get mail, which she often picked up once a month or so, and always at odd hours.", "LOL! I worded that badly. \n\nThese are psych patients going through the process of being reintegrated into society and that building is all off-campus housing with 1 or 2 employees living there too as a just in case thing. \n\nThe residents sometimes have these slappy fights where it's clear (and past experience has proven) that no one is going to get hurt. \n\nIt's not even really true slapping, but more like pawing. And that's rare.\n\nMany times it's not even an argument; one person will just stand on their balcony and start shouting in a long rant that can go as long as 45 minutes before anyone shows up because we are all so used to it that we don't feel threatened and we try to not call the business line if possible, though the facility that manages them (and is across the street but only open during biz hours) has encouraged us to err on the side of safety. \n\nEvidently that is a common cry for help, as they've told us, and that's why we call. \n\nThe local police know immediately by the address what the probable situation is and so I am cautious to never to use the word assault if it's a slappy fight. I just say, \"They're getting slappy\" and they know what I mean. \n\nThe police immediately call the counselors in the office or on their cells and they often arrive before the police.", "Thank you! That makes sense.", "My pleasure. I had a good LOL when I read your reply so, thank you  (\u2741\u00b4\u25e1\\`\u2741)\n\nIt's an old joke with my friends that I often start narratives in the middle and then I add the ending (or parts thereof) and then they finally get the beginning, and... sometimes I forget a step. \n\nThey say that I must assume that they know what's running through my mind."]}
