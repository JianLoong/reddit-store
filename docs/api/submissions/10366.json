He asked her to move her car and told her she can\u2019t do that anymore because it\u2019s not her house. He said he was polite about it, and she apologized and moved her car. \n\nThe day after that, I saw Lindsay\u2019s car parked on my drive way again after I got home from my doctors appointment and my husband was working. I decided to ask her what\u2019s going. Her: what do you mean? Me: you keep on parking your car on our drive way after we\u2019ve asked you nicely not to do that. Why do you keep doing it? Her: I have a big camper parked on my driveway and it takes up a lot of space. There isn\u2019t enough space to park my car.  Me: ok, you need to figure something out because you can\u2019t park your car on our driveway anymore. It\u2019s rude, and you\u2019ve already been told to stop. If you do it one more time, I\u2019ll have your car towed.  She apologized to me and promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again. \n\nLast night, my husband and I went out for dinner. When we got back home, we saw Lindsay\u2019s car parked on our driveway. I told my husband that was it! Enough is enough! I\u2019m going to tow her car because she\u2019s been warned. We\u2019ve tried asking her nicely, and she doesn\u2019t want to listen to us. My husband agreed, and I towed her car right away. I also stuck her with the bill because it\u2019s her own fault. Now, she is calling me an asshole and she\u2019s pissed at me.\n\nEdit: she left a not in my mailbox. She called be a drama queen and she wants to be repaid for the tow bill because it was my idea to tow her car instead of acting like an adult and asking her to move it. If I don\u2019t repay her, she will park her car in my driveway again because I\u2019m being petty.  Lmao! I\u2019ll tow her car again!

Obviously the likelihood exists she's just a narcissist, but I found in personal experience they almost play stupid finding a workaround to push your boundaries. Don't disagree the car should've been towed. That's wildly disrespectful, only saying if you are like me, and have to judge conversations on scales of effectiveness, respectfulness, and usefulness. Along the way I figured out I accepted a lot of disrespect because although I brought things to a conversation, I would allow someone like the brat to play dumb knowing they even knew that I KNEW the were full of shit.

And you agree to it and sign qn agreement as part of buying the house.", "Where we live this isn\u2019t a city ordinance, however the vehicle can\u2019t block public access (like sidewalks) and we\u2019ve seen massive RVs get towed by the city because they were so long they did block access. \n\nWhat IS a city ordinance however is you can\u2019t block someone\u2019s access to their own driveway or garage. You also can\u2019t trespass without permission.", "I lived in a small college town (about 11,000) that had the same rule. It makes sense now. But honestly I think it\u2019s dumb because now everyone that owns one has to pay to board it even if they have the space to store it on their property", "Yeah, you just call code enforcement & they take care of it. I did it on a neighbor who had 'dick' and 'asshole' spray painted on his property. \n\n(It was/ is 100% true, I just got tired of looking at it.)", "If they give you a ticket for parking on your parking pad, what are you supposed to do with the pad? Admire it from afar?", "HOAs suck so much. They could be used for good, but more often than not, that isn't the case. They're on some big power trip and love to enforce things and are generally miserable. Im super glad I live in a place now where there are lots of homes without them.", "That's so weird! My wife and I are looking to buy our first home, and a lot of places are being advertised as having two parking spaces because there's a garage and a space in front of it.", "Unclear. I think the thought was that originally, all those homes with driveways had garages at the end of them, and some of them got torn down over the decades; I can see the thought of having a parking pad in your front lawn being an eyesore. \n\nAnd a lot of people make changes to their home without checking the regulations for how they intend to use it, so I can easily see that happening.", "NTA. You told her repeatedly not to park there, and then told her if she did again, you'd have the car towed. What did she think would happen? I love that if she parks there again, you'll have it towed again! \n\nAn alternative to having it towed would be to put a wheel lock on it. You couldn't move it, but neither could she that way.", "\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole because I didn\u2019t listen to your warnings and paid the price!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t worry about \u201cupsetting the peace\u201d with your neighbors if they never even tried to keep it in the first place.", "It's also illegal for her to go into your mailbox, just FYI.

Is she a complete moron?", "NTA, but I also need INFO: where the hell does this ding dong park it when you ask her to move her car, and why can\u2019t she leave it parked there instead of inconveniencing you by using your driveway?", "NTA You have her ample warning.", "NTA. Fuck around and find out.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t warn her. \nTow it every time and stick her with the bill every time, actions have consequences", "nta, her sense of entitlement is scary. Maybe a cease and desist order, restraining order, or police report is a good idea?", "NTA. If she does it again, tow her car. Or call the police. She is acting like an entitled jerk.", "Please give an update when you have one!!", "NTA. Just keep towing her car and she will have to pay more and more until she gets it and stops.", "NTA, if she pulls that stunt again. Call the tow company. They will love you.", "NTA. Haha I love that you towed her car and her response is she'll park there again?! Haha I'd tow that thing 10 times if I had to. You asked her nicely and warned her and she still did it. What does she expect? It's not your problem that she has a big camper parked in her driveway.", "Can't you call the police? Isn't that against the law?", "NTA!!  Keep getting her car towed and do not pay her tow and storage bill. It could also be a liability issue as she does not have your permission to park there should something happen to her car. check with a lawyer though to be sure. Laws can be different in every jurisdiction.\n\nIf she hasn't changed her habits and you have to continue getting her car towed,  contact a lawyer to send her a cease and desist letter or whatever further legal action you and the lawyer deem appropriate.", "Thinking about asking a lawyer to serving her a cease and desist letter.  That way you have a legal notice to not park on your property again.", "NTA.

Someone pay for me to have good neighbors in the new neighborhood! We've been insanely spoiled with great neighbors for the last 5 years. \nNTA love, you and your husband were very patient and kind, but she took advantage of you, and when you took control, she decided to pitch a fit.

What does she think will happen that time? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA", "NTA. You have been the adult and asked her to move her car three times now. She's obviously not getting the message. Personally, I'd tell her to take you to court if she wants reimbursement & let her know that you will now tow it every time you find her car parked there. You are done with *her* teenage drama.", "NTA.\n\n\"Hey, we bought some new furniture and really can't fit all our stuff anymore. So... we moved our old dining table and fridge into your living room after you explicitly told us not to.

Parking in someone else\u2019s driveway without their permission is rude.  Maybe acceptable one time in an emergency (though can\u2019t imagine what that would be) but consistently doing it after being told not to is major league A H behavior.  Towing is probably the only thing that will eventually get her to stop.", ">A few days ago, I came home from work and saw my neighbor\u2019s \u201cLindsay\u201d car on my drive way\n\nGood on you for not letting this thing go on for weeks, months, or longer and taking care of it quickly.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I wouldn't even give one warning before teaching it towed", "I've had \"similar\" situations with visitors for the property next door to mine.

She reached the \"find out\" stage of the FAFO cycle.", "I like you. \n\nNTA!", "She's in the wrong.\nI'd have it towed to a far away location.", "My question is, why does the neighbor think that parking in your driveway again is somehow going to \"show\" you anything?

She should get her sh\\*t together and deal with her own car and drive way! I would tow her car too!", "NTA.  you warned her not to do it again, now she's mad you did what you said you would.  I'd keep right on towing her car.  eventually she will get tired of paying the impound yard all that money, and find somewhere else to park.\n\nused to dispatch tow trucks, can confirm it is mighty spendy!", "NTA.  Call a local tow company and tell to tow any car in your drive except your own.  Some will drive by for extra business. \n\nGet cameras on your home and cars.  She\u2019ll retaliate.", "NTA. I would also call the police non-emergency line and inquire about trespassing charges", "NTA.

I have hit the point that I no longer care. Every holiday there is issues of guests parking in resident spots and with mine being right near the enterance, mine is taken a lot. I ask my neighbors on each side of me if it belongs to a guest of theirs and then I call security for a tow. I am not messins around anymore, people choose to not flow the rules.\n\nI will add that I really like my direct neighbors so I give them a courtesy check first, and the one whose house is next to my carport I have offered the carport spot on holidays for their guests since I don't use it.\n\nBut yea, NTA, tow them every damn time. Also get a camera and record. I bet it keeps happening and she tries to sue you with some made up stories. You'll need proof on your side.

It literally only took a week but they didn't like the \"in progress\" look, it made our yard look \"trashy\". They got mad about our side yard fence too.
