Though, I do wonder, where is she moving the car to when you asks her to leave and why the hell doesn\u2019t she just park there in the first place?", "This and more.  Some people don't learn if there aren't real-world repercussions to their crappy,  entitled behavior.  Of course, some people never learn and double down on their bad attitude.  However,  I bet she doesn't park in OP's driveway anymore.  \n\nThat said, if the neighbor is that big of an AH, keep an eye out.  She sounds like the kind of person to retaliate. \n\nOp you are definitely NTA", "Even if it is your own drive way? NTA, but I think either one are allowed to use their space as they wish to. I do think it is super rude to use anyones private space without asking.", "Wow.  This is a brilliant observation. \n\nReasonable people totally don't understand narcissists who will take everything they can, until they can't, and then still claim to be the victim.\n\nOP needs to be wary about retaliation. \n\nCameras are a good idea.", "NTA but disagree, the neighbor clearly started the war by attempting to forcibly claim part of OP's property.  Sometimes war comes to you, however considerate or deferential you may be - OP did nothing even remotely aggressive here, and if the neighbor does anything at all I'd be contacting the police to have her trespassed.", "Put up cameras", ">Even if it is your own drive way?\n\nYup.  In my area you can't park any type of RV, or trailer in your driveway for more than 24 hours unless you have a permit that is only good for 72 hours.  This ordinance came about because certain assholes in the neighborhood were hosting parties out of their campers and causing a ton of problems.  One of those neighbors had a police scanner and if a noise complaint was called in, they'd pack up the party and move before the police got there.", "It's one of those \"please don't make the neighborhood look trashy\" laws.

If neighbor is that much of an AH then I wouldn\u2019t put it pass them to be petty.", "[deleted]", "Ah I've read things like this before. It isn't really a thing where I am from. You cannot park an RV in a public parking spot for more than a day, because of parking space issues. But you can do whatever to your own house/garden/drive way.", "No way HOA. Town ordinance about parking RVs sure. There is rarely an instance where a \" minimal\" HOA doesn't eventually morph into a giant PIA.", "Agree they certainly do/can. It was just a possible example of a round about way to get the collective neighborhood on the same page which results in not just you vs one crappy neighbor, but the neighborhood against the crappy neighbor. Also much easier than getting an ordinance passed. HOAs that are run well are just an attempt to establish rules that are clear cut to solidify the look and feel of a neighborhood. Not everyone likes them, but I\u2019ve been in plenty that weren\u2019t PIA. If run correctly they also protect the value of the homes within the neighborhood from a rogue neighbor erecting a 50ft flag pole flying whatever flag they chose right next door (real thing I have seen).", "NTA\n\nThere was always only two options here: you being a doormat and her constantly parking in your driveway, or her mad because you wouldn\u2019t be a doormat.\n\nYou told her to stop. You warned her you would call for a tow. It is appropriate for her to pay the bill for this tow.\n\nIf she\u2019s calling you an asshole it\u2019s because she\u2019s entitled, not because you did anything wrong.", "I read this as \"towing my neighbours cat\" which would have been a very different story! In my defense, I'm quite tired. NTA by the way.", "NTA, 3 warnings is plenty generous\u2026Lindsay has only herself to blame", "NTA. You gave fair warning.", "NTA. You and your husband spoke with this neighbor about her illegal parking. She ignored you each time. I'll bet she won't ignore those towing fees.", "NTA. Three strikes you're out...of money.", "Lol no, you are NTA at all for towing your neighbor's car after they repeatedly decided that they could take up your own personal property space with it. You wouldn't really be one if you'd had it towed the first time, although it was nice to provide repeated warnings.", "NTA at all.  She learned the definition of \"fuck around and find out.\"  She got what she deserved and essentially, got what she asked for.  She got the exact consequences you warned her about.", "Don't forget to invoice her for the parking", "Nta\n\nShould have towed the first time already", "NTA - You gave her more chances than she deserved. You are 100% in the right here, morally, ethically, and hopefully legally.", "NTA She didn\u2019t respond to polite requests. She was warned her car would be towed if she did it again. She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA but PLEASE post an update if you learn about what went down next after the tow!", "NTA.  Sounds like your neighbor is a total idiot or has some kind of a mental issue.", "NTA The police would not have given her three chances before they towed or ticketed her on a public street.  She was being an entitled ass continuing to park there.", "NTA.  Lindsay can call you whatever she wants.  But guess what she won't do again? Park in your driveway.  Good for you.", "NTA", "NTA Her camper, her problem. Parking repeatedly in your driveway when she\u2019s been asked repeatedly not to, and was even warned she\u2019d be towed next time, means she deserves to be towed.", "NTA\nYou warned her and she didn't listen, she won't be parking in your driveway again", "NTA. She was told what would happen if she parked in your driveway again and she still decided to park there. FAFO she did.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhen she was forced to move her car, she was clearly able to find other places to park it.  Likely down the road on the street.\n\nSo there are clearly on street parking options\n\n\nI would however get a security camera cus someone as immature as this is likely going to retaliate", "Absolutely NTA here.", "she was warned, and decided to duck around, she found out you were serious.\n\nyour property, your call, NOT her parking space.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You warned her it was going to happen. She chose to ignore the warnings. It\u2019s her own fault it happened.", "NTA", "Nta, of course you aren\u2019t. She had 3 chances! \n\nAlso it is a pain to have to go to your neighbors house and then wait for them to move their car. After the second time I would have had them towed immediately.", "NTA you told her if she did again you would have her towed. It\u2019s her fault.", "She needed to learn a lesson. She seems very entitled and....BRATTY.  I think you were right to tow it. Karma is a tow truck.", "NTA. I think you had to do it or else you'd still be dealing with her parking in the driveway. She sounds like one of those people that only learns the hard way (aka will only change things when there's a big negative consequence.)", "NTA\n\nYou warned her and it\u2019s not your problem that she doesn\u2019t have enough room for her camper.", "NTA, I don\u2019t get how parking in your driveway was going to be a long term solution. Was she just hoping you would give up parking in your driveway from now on?", "nta", "NTA.  \n\nGave her several chances.  Warned her--final warning.  \nShe failed to accept warning.", "I really got the wrong impression here with the whole \"I TOWED\" was really hoping this was a tow truck driver. Also, albeit you technically do park ON a driveway, I've never heard someone say it that way? Seems a little hoity toity to me but they may not be from around here. Still, just a lot of odd ways of framing this. I mean yea she shouldn't park there but are you sure you used the right words to indicate your desire to have a empty driveway?", "I\u2019ve literally never done this ONCE. Like, even at my parents\u2019 house I have my \u201cspace\u201d and it\u2019s not in THEIR drive way.", "The neighbor already started a war - she is claiming OP's driveway as her own, despite 3 times being told to stop and move her car. She escalated it. \n\nUnless OP wants to give up their driveway, there isn't much other choice. Warning/talking or even asking doesn't work with this thick-headed neighbor. She doesn't give a shit and is continuing to use OP's property as her own. \n\nNTA at all, OP.", "In my town you can't park RVs, boats, or other recreational vehicles in front or on the side of your house; if it can't fit in your backyard, you must pay for storage at a lot.", "In my specific HOA you're not allowed to park RV's, trailers, or campers on your driveway. Everyone parks them on the road and it blocks the whole lane. But what else are they supposed to do if they can't put them on their own property. Sadly where I live it's almost impossible not to have an HOA. Even people who have land out of town have an HOA.", "Dad's a highway engineer in the UK. Driveways and roads are all designed based on certain things. If you have a vehicle of a certain weight or more using or parked on surfaces not designed for them, it will cause substantial damage to the surface and those around it. Same for the joining sections like dropped kerbs. There's a reason why certain roads are designed to have certain mixes. If you find a road that is off a different quality but the same age, its probably because it is a rat road, a route that locals use as a short cut, so needs extra strength or they will have to resurface it way sooner. \n\nRecently an estate had a ban on vehicles over a certain weight near me until a certain date... When the company overseeing the building of it were no longer responsible for the upkeep. Loads of the roads are now breaking because they cheaped out and used rules to make it look ok.\n\nOther places it will be down to appearances. \n\nIt is a stupid and mean thing to do to park on someone's drive.", "Yep, this is true in Pittsburgh, though Pittsburgh has a particularly weird set of laws in this regard: you're not allowed to park *any* vehicle in a driveway, it must be *in* a garage, or on the street.  If you have a driveway / parking pad but no garage, you cannot park there (the city cracked down on this a few years back, there were a *lot* of tickets given out for it, even in very nice neighborhoods).", "No worries! Just wanted to acknowledge your inspired thought!", "Ha.  At our old house there were neighbors down the road who not only parked their camper in the driveway permanently,  one of their grown kids and spouse were living in it.  Their other kid and spouse lived in the house with them and the cars made quite a mess on the street.", "It's also a safety issue if they're running electrical to the recreational vehicle through unsafe/untested cables (can cause an electrical fire on either or both ends).", "I think she tried the peaceful way.  She asked three times, ***three times***, and *specifically warned she'd have no choice but to tow*.  \n\nAt this point the neighbor was basically telling OP to fuck themselves and that's her driveway now.  Sometimes force must be met with force, and if the neighbor becomes violent in her effort to forcibly take over OP's property, you have no choice but to respond with both the police and, if necessary, greater violence.  Deescalating is nice when it works but this neighbor seems to be one of those cases where it clearly wasn't going to work."]}
