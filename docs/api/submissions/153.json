During this time, my mother was always overbearing and controlling. After high school, like most people my age, I was pressured by both of my parents to go to college locally to save money while still getting higher education. The issue was that my mother was actively involved in Social Services, specifically foster care and adoption. She claimed she loved the system, but I believe it only added to her misery. While at home, I essentially became her errand boy. Running kids to appointments, babysitting, doing my fair share of chores outside of my normal expected duties as a college student living rent free.

Are you seeing girls?\u201d) to the point where I just stopped going out.\n\nWhen I finally finished college and got my first corporate job, I moved out as soon as possible. Over time, I was able to put some distance between myself and my family, much to my mother\u2019s dismay.

She wants your exclusive attention.  I think you said exactly the right thing, although I would be surprised if she hears it correctly.  I would never suggest anyone go NC with a parent, unless it was a truly abusive relationship, plus you have other family members I assume you still want to see.  Maybe for a while stop asking about upcoming plans.  Wait and let her tell you when and what is planned and if the timing works for you that is great, if it doesn't, regretfully decline.  When she calls, be pleasant but as soon as she gets unpleasant say goodbye.  See your other family members outside her home.  If she starts trying to get your attention by constantly calling or texting, block her for awhile.  Let your sister know if there is an emergency to contact you.   You are probably always going to have to \"manage\" your relationship with your mother.  And you can't blow up at her every time you talk to her, so you have to set the agenda and your limits and stick to them.", "If you don't want to be what she is- MC is the only way.

Good on you for standing up for yourself.\n\nI am not going to tell you what to do next but this is yours alone to decide.

Either way, it is done.  You'll have to find a path forward with your family."]}
