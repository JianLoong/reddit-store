Sorry. \n\nHere\u2019s how I see it: I really want my team to win (and today they did, yay). There are also teams that I really hope do NOT win, and I\u2019ll shit talk with friends who cheer for them all day long. It\u2019s also just sports. It sounds like the school they were wearing aren\u2019t even established rivals of yours, just the team y\u2019all were playing in that round, so it\u2019s even less serious. \n\nAs long as your friend and his gf didn\u2019t come in acting obnoxious or causing a scene, half the fun of this is the banter and competition. The other half is living vicariously through people who are about to leave your university with no doubt and an NBA career, lol. But never put a friendship in jealousy over the fact that you\u2019re rooting for a different team. There\u2019s always next year.", ">I may have made a bad impression on his girlfriend, but was I the asshole?\n\nYou _may_ have made? Oh yes, quite sure you made that allright.

I'm sorry for you if you don't get why your the ah.", "YTA\n\nAnd this sort of tribalism is one of the reasons I have so little interest in big sports.\n\nThey support the opposite team, so what? You kicked someone out of your home for no reason than they attended a different school than you did.

You did not want to be in the house if they were playing against each other. \nYeah it may sound stupid for OP and his friends to get upset over a game, but what was the friend thinking? A Viewing Party where his alma mater is playing her alma mater. At a place where all of his college friends were going to be. And knowing what fierce fans his friends are. That was not the time or place for them to meet his girlfriend for the first time.

Imo if she cares about the sport or school repping at all then it really just wasn't the right event to introduce her at.\n\nHonestly what's the big deal about them having to leave anyway? That's not violent. Just a hard no, not here, not for such an important game.

You are a terrible sports fan and no one wants to be around you anyway. \n\nIf you are a jets fan and can\u2019t take watching a game with a dolphins fan, you\u2019re just not a good person. It\u2019s a fucking game. Especially if the dolphins fan is your buddy\u2019s girlfriend", "Yeah I\u2019m a little surprised at the reaction here, but it\u2019s mostly people who say things like \u201csportsball\u201d and harbor a sense of intellectual superiority for not knowing anything about sports.", "If I threw a Harry Potter party and someone came dressed as Luke and leia, I\u2019d say, welcome, drinks and food are over there, have a good time.

Her baby shower when she had him was Steelers themed. I showed up to the shower wearing my Ravens gear. I also gave her a Ravens candle as one of my gifts to her because I wanted to give her some Ravens stuff but I also knew she'd burn it. This woman kept that candle for YEARS, until the Ravens and Steelers played each other in the playoffs.
