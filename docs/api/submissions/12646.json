It\u2019s not like they are at war with each other. It\u2019s a game. What did he think his friend and girlfriend would do exactly?", "or r/CFB, wish someone would do that.", "Seriously. This could lead to relentless torture of the friend instead of losing a friend.\n\nOp, You lost because YTA", "My sister who was raised in Washington her whole life is a random Cowboys fan. My cousin likes the 49ers. They rag on each other every year on fb, then the rest of the family rags on them for not rooting for the home team. At which point I chime in with some smartass comment about  sea chickens because I don't football at all. It's all in good fun.", "No going lie.... My family does a lot of yelling ... Sadly, it has proved to not be helpful & it doesn\u2019t do anything but make us loud & hoarse. Having \u201copponents\u201d in our home has never stopped us from loving the game.", "Rodgers going to the Jets is not going to help the Bears. You're still going to suck! The only time you get to celebrate is when the Packers lose, haha! \n\nI love my Packers and our Rivalry!! That's what makes it fun! Something the OP pinecone needs to learn. In all seriousness, I'm excited to see how Love steps into his role as QB. Remember, everyone said the same thing about Rodgers when Favre left. Fingers crossed!", "I don\u2019t see anything wrong with rooting for a school you didn\u2019t attend. Having a rooting interest makes sports fun, and I grew up in an area with little pro sport influence. Sure, I went to a different college, but I was a fan long before I was a student anywhere.", "Nobody loses to 15 seeds better than Mizzou \ud83d\ude02", "Boiler Maker boy.", "That might have more to do with your local area\u2019s culture. Like an American Red State but not a Blue one lol.", "My favorite thing is watching my team win, with my friends.", "It\u2019s never \u201cjust football\u201d in Tuscaloosa lol.", "So, I went to Purdue...", "I was literally singing Rocky Top yesterday.  Never thought that would happen.", "Hahaha. Same here. It is always best Duke. I didn\u2019t even go to an ACC team lol.", "Mario Lemieux!", "Hahaha", "A lot of the time it involves copious amounts of alcohol being consumed, so there is that\u2026", "Wait where did we find out OP spent time alone in the basement watching the super bowl?", "YTA, from start to finish, but it boils down to it being stupid to kick someone out of a party because of who they're rooting for.\n\nI went to a big school that wins a lot of things in Ohio (should sum it up fine), and we have rivals up north...one of the biggest rivalries in college sports, and much bigger than whatever nonsense rivalry you're talking about here. I've **invited** plenty of friends that went to that dirtbag school up north, because they're my friends...they just happened to go to another school 20 years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, if you're so connected to the college rivalry that you're willing to alienate a friend and kick them out of your party, you should move past your college days. There's no reason for adults to be so tied back to the place they got a degree from that they're willing to be rude like this.", "I agree. Also as someone who dated a guy whose baseball team was my teams direct rival, neither one of us lost our shit at each other when we met in the playoffs", "Came here to write the exact same thing. Saved me from typing some characters.", "Haha this guy", "seriously. similar vein, i\u2019m a buffalo bills fans. i get to a couple games a year and it\u2019s fun to banter with people who are fans of the visiting team. at the end of the day it\u2019s harmless shit talking and all in good fun", "I totally thought it was gonna be a thing where the new GF was trying to chatty Cathy and shit during the game! Opposing team jersey? Not worth the fight.", "Because it can be fun around people who aren\u2019t absolute morons about it. \n\nMy dad and brother are huge Man Utd fans so I always support Liverpool just to irk them. They take it as the joke it is and we have fun ribbing each other.\n\nI may have had more fun recently when Liverpool won 7-0 to Man Utd.", "The unpaid players don't see a cent of the profits, either.", "Yeah, I was waiting for OP to be like his friends gf got way too drunk and started breaking things, but seriously they just were fans of the other team?! YTA", "Ahh thank you! Crazy game so far. Happy madness\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udde1 I can't say go Vols but congrats on beating Duke\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "If someone wrote this up with OP getting trashed all night, OP and friends would still be an asshole.  The only way to get a NTA judgement from the masses would be to accept it.", "I totally get a family connection. My oldest daughter is a sophomore at a school that I never attended but I cheer for that school. My sister graduated from a small school that's a definite underdog when they make the NCAA tournament and I cheer for them. Of course if either played my alma mater, I'm cheering for my alma mater.\n\nIf it was just a handful of people, or if these fans weren't absolute obnoxious lunatics, it would be different. But the fan base I'm referring to has been horrible for years and is well-known for it. \"I don't have to be a graduate to know that my school is the best in everything and that your school will never do anything important...you wasted your money going to a lesser school...you couldn't have even gotten admitted at my school...\" and so on. Like SHUT UP ALREADY. \ud83d\ude44", "Nothing wrong with being a normal fan of a school you never attended. I root for a couple schools I never attended (as long as they're not playing my alma mater, which doesn't usually happen due to geographical distances and different conferences) - the school where my oldest daughter goes, a \"family\" school where several relatives graduated from, and the small college my sister graduated from because they often don't make the NCAA basketball tournament and when they do, they're one of the underdogs.\n\nI've been told by Best College Ever fans that I threw my life away because I didn't go to Best College Ever (cool story, you didn't either), that I'm a loser because I couldn't get in to Best College Ever (never applied because zero interest in going there, but OK) and had to settle for a lesser school (my alma mater is a STEM school, nothing lesser about it), that I only root for Other College because I can't handle being part of the Best College Ever family. Just...what? The lunatic fan base has been known to start physical altercations with fans of opposing teams for no reason, all for a school that they never even attended (not that attending it would make this behavior OK).\n\nIt's bizarre to me to make so much of your life and your own identity about a team and a school that you were never a part of. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think Purdue fans are extremely butthurt today\u2026 go FDU!!", "The best part is the ending.  He gets sent to church and prays that God will send a million months to eat his Leafs sweater.", "At least you didn\u2019t lose to a 15 seed this year!", "You know what, at least he's bringing something to the table at all with that behavior. Putting up with that bullshit should absolutely entitle her for compensation.", "Yeahhhh I feel bad doing a bracket with my friend from hs who is a zag because she always loses.", "I dont frequent /r/collegebasketball but I do frequent /r/cfb and they will tell you there that rivalries are one of the most important things in the sport and barring your opponent from watching the game would take away from the rivalry aspect of the sport. I have been to ~10 OU away games (including a couple in stillwater and lincoln, two of our rivalry games) and have been received more graciously by strangers tail gating, in the stadium, and in bars than this dude was received by his buddies", "Imo it\u2019s not about his girlfriend wearing the other team\u2019s colors, it\u2019s about the friend doing it.", "yeah, the more debilitating head injuries, the better", "Why are Mizzou fans so hostile?", "Yeah I was joking man. It\u2019s flat out nuts what this guy did.", "Why bring her then?  This would be a poor event to introduce someone new.", "Idk. Overcompensating for all those national championships they haven't won? \ud83e\udd23", "Because these are literally his friends. From his school. Going to his friend's house, who hasn't even met her yet.\n\nHow do you imagine she got invited by someone who doesn't know her?", "Oops I didnt read the tone properly, cheers", "I do too; I mostly watch rugby. But if it's a group I haven't met before, I would be on edge mixing alcohol and sports.", "NTA - If you were having a party with fans of many different teams it\u2019d be one thing, but you were having a close group of friends over to support your team. Nothing wrong with not wanting opposing fans there.", "As a jags fan: Bruh just wash the thing. At this point, it\u2019s probably help us", "And that's my point. OP is a child. Friend wasn't aware of it and walked his girlfriend into a clown party", "Haha to be fair, it\u2019s a New Jersey I got, haven\u2019t needed to wash it yet. I think only wore it during the chiefs game", "I am in Ohio and we also have a decent Michigan following in my area, too, due to a factory opening a plant here and relocating a good number of MI people to here in the late 70s. We also have lots of House Divided merchandise in stores. Thankfully, I only know a few idiots that take the rivalry too far. I actually prefer to watch the Big Game with a group of people that support both teams. I think it is more fun that way.", "His identity not being challenged is more important than having friends.", "They were supposed to say, \u201cHoly s***! He must be in LOVE to wear that shirt!\u201d and give him crap for the rest of the game while joking with the GF about her bad taste (in teams and men). And her agreeing to go to that party surrounded by \u201cthe enemy\u201d was supposed to be \u201cproof\u201d that she really liked him, too, and truly wanted to meet his friends. I\u2019m sure he told her that they\u2019re a bunch of great guys and it would be fine. And because the two of them are probably good sports, they thought everyone else would be, too.\n\nNow it\u2019s a March Madness Romeo and Juliet situation!", "And often money, betting is something a surprising amount of people like to do."]}
