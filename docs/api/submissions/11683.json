She needs some real parenting classes and a break from social media.", "NTA. \n\nFirst off, I feel like this might be an unpopular opinion... But children aren't your fucking property. Just because they're young doesn't mean they have no right to decide what they want at all, and if the toddler is expressing that she doesn't want to be filmed? Then that is something I think should be respected. When we ignore what young children express, when we as adults or their parents ignore their boundaries, we are teaching them that adult are ALLOWED to do things they don't want them to. That, as they grow up, they have no right to express boundaries over their own bodies. It's in the same vein as forcing children to hug people or kiss people. It's just... Really, really uncomfortable and nasty to me. \n\nSecondly, I personally have a LOT of icky feelings about people spreading their kids all over the internet and using them for clout or followers or whatever. It just feels gross to me. \n\nIMO, you didn't \"ruin\" your sister's life. She's lashing out because she knows that what she's doing really kinda isn't okay, and she's angry she got called out. And you potentially just saved your nieces a lot of future embarrassment and exploitation. \n\nChildren aren't property, and they aren't video fodder, either. But that's just how I see it.", "NTA, your sister is exploiting her children for profit. Their father is now aware, so it is up to him to change the situation to protect them.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA for standing up for your nieces. Breaks my heart that your sister kept going until your niece cried. Your BIL definitely deserves to know what\u2019s being posted about his kids", "NTA\n\nI find it disgusting when influencers use their kids for profit on their platforms.\n\nHer husband should be pissed", "NTA. Shes 19 and sounds like she still needs to grow, you were standing up for your nieces! And the audience analytics was good to point out, I hate how gross the internet can be and its good you\u2019re trying to protect your nieces!", "Hard one. Gotta stay with NTA, because apparently it's seems like Daddy'o'five story wasn't enough for everybody to understand that neglect for likes is also neglect.\nThis whole \"it's for your future\" thing disgusts me. And I personally think that you did the right thing by telling sister's husband. If she doesn't stop it, he will", "NTA. You did the right thing. \n\nTheir father had the right to know the real extent of what your sister was doing. She was really showing them that they did not have any consent about being exploited on her social media.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing, I don't know if your brother in law is the girls father (I don't recall you clarifing that) but he deserves to know what kind of person his wife is. Your sister is obviously not prepared to be a mom and she sees her kids as things she can exploit to make profit, it's awful and she deserves to be called out to everyone that follows her.\n\nAnd you're not overstepping, you are an uncle worried for his nieces wellbeing. After what you saw you had every right to do what you did. And **that's** something the little girls will be grateful for in the future.", "NTA - It's not like you went straight to your BIL. You tried to discuss it with her and she was outright ignoring you. Not even a discussion. You are looking out for the mental, emotional, and physical welfare of your family (nieces). The next logical step was to speak with the other parent, which is exactly what you did. Your relationship with your sister will likely suffer, but that's her choice to throw a tantrum. You called attention to a concern and stood up for your nieces.  \n\n\nMost young children love when mom/dad take their picture, so wow. If a 2 year old is saying \"enough is enough, leave me alone\" (basically) you know you've pushed it way too far.", "NTA if there was nothing for you to worry about, their father would not have reacted as he did.  You are right to be worried about the children and their privacy.  And we are starting to see the stories of families nearly destroyed by living constantly on camera. I personally think we were not meant to live like this, but even if your sister chooses this life for herself, she shouldn't choose it for her children without their permission.", "I\u2019m not sure where this is going to go, but I say NTA. Overstepping is a really fine line, and I tend to err on the side of not\u2014however, you care. You care about your nieces and you care about your sister. I guess the social media thing is one thing if the kids want to be involved, but I could go off about people exploiting their children like that. I think your sister is the AH for exploiting her children and forcing pictures on them when at least one of them is already expressing a clear boundary that your sister is blatantly ignoring. Personally, I respect my children\u2019s boundaries for everything but health and hygiene. You probably did overstep, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for it. I think if your sister won\u2019t listen to genuine reason or at least entertain a thoughtful conversation about it, then you did the right thing. Otherwise, you\u2019re sitting back and just watching your sister mess up her kids. In my opinion, it\u2019s borderline abuse, if we\u2019re being honest.", "NTA.

Because of your fucking sister! I\u2019m sorry but sounds like she doesn\u2019t deserve her kids. Sounds like she only likes the attention. Idk that\u2019s abusive to me\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. Your sister is 19, but she is married with 3 kids. Which makes her a full-grown adult, even without being married with kids. You went behind her back and created a problem within HER marriage and HER family. \n\nIf this was my sister. I would have mentally noted what I saw. I would have taken her to lunch and expressed my concerns one on one. If I felt that she wasn't hearing or not taking seriously what I was saying I would then inform her of what I was going to do because I felt like she wasn't mature enough to understand my words and her actions. But I would have never gone behind her back. I would have been transparent in what I was going to do. \n\nShe may not be mature but she was mature enough for all of you, when she got married and had kids. I think maturity should of been an issue at the marriage. Not at the point you don't like what she doing and therefore now she is not mature.", "YTA", "One of my most unpopular opinions is that it should be illegal for people to use their kids for internet clout like this.", "We've been seeing for the last decade how it affects kids to have their entire lives vlogged by their parents. It's damaging as hell.\n\nNTA, OP", "Daddy O\u2019 Five was straight abuse, not neglect. They set up and filmed slap fights between their small children, physically abused the one red head son, psychologically traumatized him by saying they would leave him at foster care if he ever complained. Don\u2019t say neglect for them. It was all abuse", "That is so creepy I don\u2019t even know where to start. Good on your uncle for blurring the kids.", "It's not just her choice. It's a choice she and her husband need to be on equal grounding with. Clearly, it doesn't sound like they are.", "Its probably only unpopular to the influencer crowd, because I agree with you. Children don't get to consent to being exploited and when all they have is an influencer parent to depend on, then what else can they do? People will see a roof over their heads, and clothes, and food, but to really see not only the neglect, but the physical and mental tear down of always having a camera in your face, having to set up or act up because mom said so and its their mom so they have to do it... There is no protection for it. I predict a lot of tell all's and parents being exposed in the next coming decade. Its going to be ugly.", "[deleted]", "6 months, not 6 years, so she had her youngest (2) around 17."]}
