I asked Lexi like why does she still record them when they\u2019re not in the mood, she looks at me and laughs and said \u201c omg their never in the mood, you gotta take what you can get . \u201c l then press her and to tell her like your kids have boundaries and it\u2019s your job to like acknowledge them and not push them, then she shuts me down and says \u201c  I know what I\u2019m doing don\u2019t mother me, the sponsorships will pay for their college and they will thank me when they\u2019re older.\u201d  \n\nI was really upset leaving that lunch thinking that my sister has lost herself with the social media content creating, and I reached out to my brother in law ( lexis husband) about what I saw and that I\u2019m worried about the girls being on the internet at all times and I recounted to him the lunch we had . I also urged him to check the audience analytics. He told me thank you and that he will look into everything of what I told him and he will  get back to me.

She then says I ruined her life and that I\u2019m jealous of her and that\u2019s why I told. I didn\u2019t even get word out and she just hung up on me.

She needs some real parenting classes and a break from social media.", "NTA. \n\nFirst off, I feel like this might be an unpopular opinion... But children aren't your fucking property. Just because they're young doesn't mean they have no right to decide what they want at all, and if the toddler is expressing that she doesn't want to be filmed? Then that is something I think should be respected. When we ignore what young children express, when we as adults or their parents ignore their boundaries, we are teaching them that adult are ALLOWED to do things they don't want them to. That, as they grow up, they have no right to express boundaries over their own bodies. It's in the same vein as forcing children to hug people or kiss people. It's just... Really, really uncomfortable and nasty to me. \n\nSecondly, I personally have a LOT of icky feelings about people spreading their kids all over the internet and using them for clout or followers or whatever. It just feels gross to me. \n\nIMO, you didn't \"ruin\" your sister's life. She's lashing out because she knows that what she's doing really kinda isn't okay, and she's angry she got called out. And you potentially just saved your nieces a lot of future embarrassment and exploitation. \n\nChildren aren't property, and they aren't video fodder, either. But that's just how I see it.", "NTA, your sister is exploiting her children for profit. Their father is now aware, so it is up to him to cha ge the situation to protect them.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA for standing up for your nieces. Breaks my heart that your sister kept going until your niece cried. Your BIL definitely deserves to know what\u2019s being posted about his kids", "NTA\n\nI find it disgusting when influencers use their kids for profit on their platforms.\n\nHer husband should be pissed", "NTA. Shes 19 and sounds like she still needs to grow, you were standing up for your nieces! And the audience analytics was good to point out, I hate how gross the internet can be and its good you\u2019re trying to protect your nieces!", "Hard one. Gotta stay with NTA, because apparently it's seems like Daddy'o'five story wasn't enough for everybody to understand that neglect for likes is also neglect.\nThis whole \"it's for your future\" thing disgusts me. And I personally think that you did the right thing by telling sister's husband. If she doesn't stop it, he will", "NTA. You did the right thing. \n\nTheir father had the right to know the real extent of what your sister was doing. She was really showing them that they did not have any consent about being exploited on her social media.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing, I don't know if your brother in law is the girls father (I don't recall you clarifing that) but he deserves to know what kind of person his wife is. Your sister is obviously not prepared to be a mom and she sees her kids as things she can exploit to make profit, it's awful and she deserves to be called out to everyone that follows her.\n\nAnd you're not overstepping, you are an uncle worried for his nieces wellbeing. After what you saw you had every right to do what you did. And **that's** something the little girls will be grateful for in the future.", "NTA - It's not like you went straight to your BIL. You tried to discuss it with her and she was outright ignoring you. Not even a discussion. You are looking out for the mental, emotional, and physical welfare of your family (nieces). The next logical step was to speak with the other parent, which is exactly what you did. Your relationship with your sister will likely suffer, but that's her choice to throw a tantrum. You called attention to a concern and stood up for your nieces.  \n\n\nMost young children love when mom/dad take their picture, so wow. If a 2 year old is saying \"enough is enough, leave me alone\" (basically) you know you've pushed it way too far.", "NTA if there was nothing for you to worry about, their father would not have reacted as he did.  You are right to be worried about the children and their privacy.  And we are starting to see the stories of families nearly destroyed by living constantly on camera. I personally think we were not meant to live like this, but even if your sister chooses this life for herself, she shouldn't choose it for her children without their permission.", "I\u2019m not sure where this is going to go, but I say NTA. Overstepping is a really fine line, and I tend to err on the side of not\u2014however, you care. You care about your nieces and you care about your sister. I guess the social media thing is one thing if the kids want to be involved, but I could go off about people exploiting their children like that. I think your sister is the AH for exploiting her children and forcing pictures on them when at least one of them is already expressing a clear boundary that your sister is blatantly ignoring. Personally, I respect my children\u2019s boundaries for everything but health and hygiene. You probably did overstep, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for it. I think if your sister won\u2019t listen to genuine reason or at least entertain a thoughtful conversation about it, then you did the right thing. Otherwise, you\u2019re sitting back and just watching your sister mess up her kids. In my opinion, it\u2019s borderline abuse, if we\u2019re being honest.", "NTA. You were legitimately concerned for your nieces. Obviously, their dad was concerned too. Their mom should have considered their dad's opinion in the first place. You did the right thing.", "Your sister is ruining your niece\u2019s life. The welfare of your niece should be the top priority. \n\nNTA", "NTA,The husband made the call, you only gave him a heads up.", "NTA NTA NTA! I hope your sister realizes that if she keeps doing that kind of stuff it's going to ruin her children's lives and her own eventually. It's just like that mom who was trying to get her son to cry on camera for a thumbnail.", "NTA.  Because I'm petty, I'd post on all of her videos that the kids do not like, nor consent to being recorded and put on social media.  Then watch and see if her \"followers\" eat her alive.", "The No picture mommy is really bothering me. NTA", "NTA - she is taking advantage of children for online clout. There are real creeps out there, and the fact that she is fine with that is not ok. She is ignoring her children\u2019s needs, and their boundaries. The fact that her husband is not ok with the content or audience says a lot.", "NTA - they\u2019re making a new law in France to stop parents doing this to their kids.        \nPeople could end up in prison", "You are jealous.   \nYou raised it with your sister which is fine, but then you go behind her back to BIL.

Not much harm in that, right?", "But somehow can't manage to mind your own business and feel the need to overstep boundaries?", " Do you honestly think this is abuse?  \nIf its abuse she should have reported abuse with the apropriate authorities.

What about her kids who told her no pictures. What about their boundaries.", "I think this could become abuse over time.\n\nNo, cps or cops are not the first step in case of abuse. Notifying other parents and people important for the kids comes first.\n\nWouldn't going to cps be going behind the sisters back?", "Where is the actual child endangerment or neglect? Really what part??  \nThe fact it needs to be exagerrated to the nth degree like this shows the older sister is just a b.   \nIt's not abuse or neglect for parents to take photos of their kids even when the kids say no, and to say so is a disservice to children actually abused and neglected.  \nMillions of mothers around the world are doing the exact same thing, but this older sister only has a problem with her younger sister doing it.

Being abused during childhood does not make you the arbitrar of what constitutes abuse.  \n\n\nLots of people do this. It may not be healthy but there is no laws against it, the online platforms terms of use allow this and propergate it and the same reason why no one is saying call the police. this is not abuse.   \n\n\nWhy is the husband still permitting some videos to remain up if this was abuse?", "You do know that there is a lady being investigated for this very same thing right? She has a tik tok page where she literally \"accidentally\" posted a video of her verbally abusing her little girl in front of the camera. Her little girl was legit in tears and it's all over the internet. She got a lot of backlash from her viewers for it and honestly it's not the only video.

Her kids are not her accessories for views.", "NTA. My uncle runs a fishing channel with a group of friends. They noticed they were getting 10x as many views when a kid was in the boat with them. It took a minute but they realized what their audience was really after and shortly after started blurring the kids in the video. All their extra brows vanished.", "She's not setting them up for success, either. OP said the child had to cry to get the mother to stop. This is going to be a very hard maladaptive habit that will be hard to break when they get older. It seems reasonable now, because it is (their mother is literally ignoring them) but the hardest habits to break are those done out of survival :(", "Agree 100%.", "Your children not being your property is only unpopular to parents who want to abuse their kids. \n\nYour first duties are to protect and provide for their welfare. Otherwise you treat them like the autonomous humans they are.", "Same. I can't imagine what that child must have been through to learn that so young.", "Since when it \"going behind her back\" to speak to the child's father about her concerns.   And to address your follow-on comment, it is the aunts business to advocate for her toddler niece when the child's own mother is ignoring her needs.", "Will it make up for years of therapy they\u2019ll need because they only got attention or recognition from their mother when she was holding a camera in their face? \n\nTheir mental misery isn\u2019t worth that.", "Talk to Brittany Spears about that."]}
