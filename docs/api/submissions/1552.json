{"id": 1552, "submission_id": "ymzaep", "title": "AITA For refusing access to my financial accounts and asking for a prenup?", "selftext": "Me(26m) and GF(24f) have been together for 6 years and we have planned on getting married for over two years now, but we postponed any of those plans due to not being able to have a wedding due to COVID spreading everywhere and us having no money to afford a wedding/rings anyways.\n\nWe have been living paycheck to paycheck since my career was just starting off in low pay entry positions and she only gets a small stipend from her university. I ended up being laid off two months ago, so she has been supporting me by paying for food/necessities with her small stipend while my best friend has been paying my share of the rent and the entirety of our other bills. Because of them, I was able to focus on finding a great job where I'm now making 6 figures. My best friend was elated, but GF on the other hand didn't believe this was real. This changed as soon as she saw me filling out my employment forms.\n\nOnce she understood this was real, she began talking about all the different things she wants to blow my money on. Luxury handbags, jewelry, clothes, new phone, etc. I'm now expected to pay her share of the rent from now on. I just shrugged off those conversations and changed the subject. Now, we're back on the topic of marriage since we're now in a good financial position to do so and it would be in our best interest for tax reasons, but our private discussion blew up into a whole clown fiesta in our shared apartment and everyone is involved.\n\nHer demands for marriage were that I give her access to all of my bank accounts. Not just the joint account that I would contribute to (mainly for bills) or the spending account that I planned on funding so she could enjoy her life with a reasonable amount of expendable income. She wanted all of them. My demands were that I would keep my main bank account private, as well as my crypto and stock accounts. I also asked for a prenup that would separate our marriage from my business. I will maintain full ownership and full liability for any debts in the event of a divorce.\n\nHearing my demands for marriage triggered GF emotionally, as she immediately ran upstairs and began asking everyone there if prenups were a real thing that Americans do. She then starts trash talking American culture, making accusations that I'm going to keep a hidden account to fool around behind her back and telling everyone that I have been poor for the entirety of our relationship while she supported me. To be fair, her PARENTS supported us both for a year and then my parents supported us by letting us live with them rent free for two years.\n\nEveryone else who was here at the time gave their opinions and tried comforting GF. They sympathized with her and tried their best to explain my point of view. A few friends are completely on my side, some say that we both have valid viewpoints, some say that I am wrong because I made GF feel insecure.\n\nAITA for telling her I would not give her access to ALL of my financial accounts and asking for a prenup?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit with relevant info: The prenup only effects OWNERSHIP of my business. GF would still be entitled to my personal assets and income. The business is not successful yet either. Should it fail and I end up in massive debt, the prenup would protect GF from being left with half of it.\n\nGF is not giving up her future to be a housewife. She is currently a PhD student and has a bright future even without my help.\n\nI don't intend to hide my finances. She would be able to look at them at any time by asking me.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1667666790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymzaep/aita_for_refusing_access_to_my_financial_accounts/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Prenup could mean a very bad deal to a woman. She sometimes providing all of what she provides under traditional marriage, but she also has to work because her husband is not going to share. If she's going to be a house wife what you offer is not a good deal. If she's going to work she would probably end up like every woman almost - working for a lesser time and wages from her husband and then returning home to a second shift of taking care of the house because the husband is still at work (managing all the stocks and crypto she has no access to while she takes care of the kids).\n\nIf that woman marries you with prenup - she's and idiot, and she doesn't sound like an idiot.\n\nEither choose someone as rich as you, or choose someone you trust and hold hand together and build you house and family together on your shared funds energy and abilities.

I ended up being laid off two months ago, so she has been supporting me by paying for food/necessities with her small stipend while my best friend has been paying my share of the rent and the entirety of our other bills. Because of them, I was able to focus on finding a great job where I'm now making 6 figures. My best friend was elated, but GF on the other hand didn't believe this was real. This changed as soon as she saw me filling out my employment forms.\n\nOnce she understood this was real, she began talking about all the different things she wants to blow my money on. Luxury handbags, jewelry, clothes, new phone, etc. I'm now expected to pay her share of the rent from now on. I just shrugged off those conversations and changed the subject. Now, we're back on the topic of marriage since we're now in a good financial position to do so and it would be in our best interest for tax reasons, but our private discussion blew up into a whole clown fiesta in our shared apartment and everyone is involved.\n\nHer demands for marriage were that I give her access to all of my bank accounts. Not just the joint account that I would contribute to (mainly for bills) or the spending account that I planned on funding so she could enjoy her life with a reasonable amount of expendable income. She wanted all of them. My demands were that I would keep my main bank account private, as well as my crypto and stock accounts. I also asked for a prenup that would separate our marriage from my business. I will maintain full ownership and full liability for any debts in the event of a divorce.\n\nHearing my demands for marriage triggered GF emotionally, as she immediately ran upstairs and began asking everyone there if prenups were a real thing that Americans do. She then starts trash talking American culture, making accusations that I'm going to keep a hidden account to fool around behind her back and telling everyone that I have been poor for the entirety of our relationship while she supported me. To be fair, her PARENTS supported us both for a year and then my parents supported us by letting us live with them rent free for two years.\n\nEveryone else who was here at the time gave their opinions and tried comforting GF. They sympathized with her and tried their best to explain my point of view. A few friends are completely on my side, some say that we both have valid viewpoints, some say that I am wrong because I made GF feel insecure.\n\nAITA for telling her I would not give her access to ALL of my financial accounts and asking for a prenup?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Parasite. \n\nHer paying for his share of their food bill for a mere 2 months is a drop in the ocean compared to what she\u2019s demanding.", "And the first thing she comes up with when he tells her what he will make now, is how she can suddenly have ALL the luxury stuff and wants access to alle his bank accounts...to me that sounds hard like draining him", "They arent getting married this instant, he'll obviously have to save some money for the wedding, and if he's smart, an emergency fund before signing a prenuptial agreement.", "Food and necessities lol how do you over look the second part. That could include anything and you just overlook it.", "I don't think she would do something that extreme, more likely racking up a bunch of smaller purchases and not leaving enough for bills.\n\nIt's also how we have operated with our bank accounts prior to this. I never use her card to buy anything without asking permission first. I don't have her account login info, but if I ever wanted access I suppose I would have just asked her to login for me.", "And your making it sound like it was for months and months of support. Food and necessities cost very little compared to rent. Which she did not help with.", "We can just agree to disagree. If MY WIFE supported me for months by literally putting food in my mouth when I couldn\u2019t afford to feed myself. I\u2019d be willing to let them live as luxurious as I could\u2026but hey some people don\u2019t care about things like that.", "Again, it was only for 2 months. He did say he would give her money every month for luxurious. \n\nHe does not want her to have access to his main account. Which is more than fair because she sounds like a gold digger anyway.", "How is she a gold digger if she supported him without the knowledge he would ever make it? It\u2019s not like he said \u201cit will only be for 2 months\u201d she was supporting him for an indefinite amount of time. But like I said I\u2019d have my wife off her feet if I could with the bags she wants lol you can put your wife on an allowance."]}
