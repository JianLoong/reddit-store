Instead, you're removing a potential distraction and bit of awkwardness from the ceremony.", "NTA. Your friend is trying to stir some drama by asking you to go to your ex\u2019s wedding.", "NTA, and I am quite sure the ex would not want you there either. These people are strange and you are behaving as any normal person would in that situation. Also, the girlfriend is really strange, inviting you and not telling you about that. I would seriously reevaluate my relationship with her.", "Who are all these idiots that are contacting you and saying that you are being selfish and immature? Those people really need to get a grip. You are definitely doing the right thing, but avoiding the situation altogether. This could\u2019ve been handled quietly but your friend decided to make a big deal and broadcast it. You also handled it right when you contacted the bride directly to let her know what\u2019s going on. Your friend is the AH and anyone that tells you you need to go are AH\u2019s also. But you definitely are NTA.", "NTA.  Who goes to an ex's wedding?  The bride was actually happy you do not go.", "NTA. I've literally never been to a wedding where you essentially lock in your plus one by name. You either get a plus one or don't. Your girlfriend can find someone else. This is the wedding of a person only tertiarilly connected to you and then another person you had a falling out with. Your presence there (no offense intended) is not necessary nor will it be missed by the bride and groom. Something weird is going on with your friend trying to force you into this situation. It's suspicious she would ask you to go, knowing the groom is your ex. And is just super fucking weird to try to convince someone that a plus one commitment is this intense. If you find out why she's being so weird please update us", "NTA \n\nJFC you don\u2019t go to your ex\u2019s wedding. Your friends are either messy as hell or completely clueless. It\u2019s so disrespectful for exes to go to a wedding unless there are explicit exceptions given by the bride & groom.", "NTA. Your friend is a shit-stirrer planning to start some drama. She\u2019s lying about not remembering the guy is your ex. She could just ask someone else to go with her. Nobody else is going to care. Consider that she might be spreading lies about what\u2019s happening- like saying you\u2019re trying to get her to boycott the wedding. You need better friends.", "NTA.  If you and one of the people getting married ended on less than great terms, not going is prioritizing their comfort and avoiding stress and awkwardness at their wedding, not just your own.  It was absolutely the correct choice.  Your ex deserved to not have that potential mess and distraction on his wedding day.  If you put it that way to people, I expect you\u2019ll stop hearing the bs about it being immature/selfish/etc.", "why the hell do people want you to go so bad?? thats so weird to me NTA", "NTA.\n\nWho in their right mind would try to make you feel bad? You haven't done anything wrong here, and your friend sounds like a scheming person", "Nta cut these people  loose your \" friend\" invited you knew all along was trying set you up for drama that is not your friend", "NTA your friend wants you to attend ex wedding because they want some drama. If bride don't mind that you don't go other people can keep they opinion to themselves.", "You're not even invited. You're someone's plus one. How is this even an issue. \n\nAs the bride I would be thankful for you not coming. It's their day, it's not about an ex.\n\nAs an attendee I would be delighted to see if you are going to cause some drama( this is the only reason I can imagine your \" friend\" inviting you to this wedding as their plus one. \n\nNtA", "What kind of awful people are you surrounding yourself with? NTA. But the people harassing you are. You don\u2019t have to go anywhere you don\u2019t want to!", "It's a wedding.  You're not required to attend unless you're the one getting married.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You weren't even the invitee - you are the plus one.  Your friend (is she?), can ask someone else to go.", "NTA. You have some weird friends that\u2019s for sure. And who are these people claiming you should support your ex by going to this wedding? I can\u2019t believe they really feel that way. It\u2019s just so,\u2026 rude.", "NTA, and I find it odd how invested people are with having you attend. While I wouldn\u2019t be devastated if one of my exes happened to be at my wedding, my preference would be for it to not happen, so why would people push for this?", "NTA What about the groom's feelings? It's his big day too, and even though everyone's moved on, I doubt he'd want to see an ex, especially if the ending was messy, at his own wedding. The bride gave you the pass, OP- the only ones making the day about themselves are the ones trying to pressure you into an uncomfortable situation and making a big deal out of you not playing their game.", "NTA it\u2019s weird both your friend and others are saying your immature for doing this, especially when you did the right thing and contacted the bride in a civil manor and it seems she was more than understanding. Also, if you\u2019re a plus one then why are people so upset you\u2019re not going even if you weren\u2019t the original guest they wanted to invite? Your friend is acting strange", "The only way I would even consider going to an ex\u2019s wedding is if the EX reached out and invited me. Especially if we had a messy/difficult break up, and no contact in years. OP you are NTA and 100% doing the right thing by not attending. \n\nAs another note to help reinforce your decision, the bride seemed fine and not at all offended by your decision, and your ex hasn\u2019t reached out to offer any counter argument/invite you/smooth things over, etc. So if the two most important people at the wedding are unfazed, you\u2019re golden. It\u2019s not up to any of your other friends, and really doesn\u2019t affect them. The only people who seem to be bothered by this have nothing to do with it. Take this with a grain of salt, but I\u2019d consider doing some reflecting on the quality/caliber of your friends. It sounds like they\u2019re kind of shit-stirrers and looking for drama. Which isn\u2019t great and can get real old, real fast.\n\nThere\u2019s a tiny, tiny case to be made that dropping out of an RSVP\u2019d invite is a bit of an ah move, but you gave plenty of notice for either the count to be adjusted or your friend to find another plus one. So you\u2019re fully in the clear.", "What's with that trend that weddings invites are actually summons in disguise?", "NTA. Your friend 100% knew and is being weird. \n\nLiterally doesn't matter, shit happens, you say you'll go to a wedding a month away and 2 weeks later something comes up and you need to pull out, who cares. You found out who the groom was and didn't want to go, the end, literally no one at all should have a problem with this. Completely irrelevant if you said you'd go before.\n\nAt worst, if it's a particularly small wedding and by agreeing to go they spent an extra $100 on another meal and no one else could attend I might cover that cost, but you still don't have to go.\n\nI have zero clue why your friend not anyone else would care in the slightest about you going or not.", "NTA. And you are supporting your ex\u2019s happiness by not attending. Your presence is more likely to be a distraction to their special day than your absence is.", "NTA, you have the right not to go. Your friend should have told you and I\u2019m sure your ex doesn\u2019t want you there anyways. Your presence at the wedding would probably become awkward and overwhelming for you and your ex.", "NTA. \n\nYou can respect your ex\u2019s happiness from afar", "NTA your friend should just invite someone else you're not in the bridal party and whoever contacted you is overstepping.", "Friend was up to no good. She knew what she was doing...she and others were planning for drama/laugh at your expense and you thwarted them. You'll have the last laugh.\nNTA", "Nta you have a very weird friend group because I think you did the right thing. Don\u2019t go and maybe re-evaluate your friendship because it sounds like they did this on purpose. \n\nDoes everyone saying your a bad friend know the story?", "Friend is Toxic AF. You're NTA in anyway. This is awful.", "NTA.", "NTA all those people saying otherwise are weak minded. You can be happy for an ex but not be associated with them. Your not abandoning anyone and even explained that you just didn't want to. Your friend probably didn't remember but shouldn't be upset that once you found out you obviously don't want to be bothered.", "NTA but your friend sure is.  What is the big deal of having you accompany her as her plus one to this wedding?  I don\u2019t get it.  Doesn\u2019t your friend have another friend who can do in your place?\n\nTheir negative reaction is completely baffling.", "NTA\nThis is WEIRD. Did you ex ask the mutual friend to invite you so that he could show off his new life?  Was there a gang of people hoping to pull a Carrie style horror show on you?  I literally cannot see why your attendance is so crucial to your ex's wedding, or why your friend would be so bothered by you not wanting to go. Was there a publicly available list of people who were/ were not attending the wedding  and a reason why...  Why are so many people interested in this? I don't think not attending a wedding is immature, you don't actually have to \"support\" anyones happiness,  especially somebody who was part of a hurtful event for you.  You might need to reevaluate friendships here.", "NTA.  Your \"friend\" was looking to start some fireworks or something by not saying who the groom was.  Tell any person with an opinion about this to mind their own business.  You were being set up to confront your ex by this former friend for some unknown reason, she knew you had a previous relationship and played dumb instead of being upfront about it.  Your former friend can go by herself or find another person to go with her.", "Nta. You are doing the most mature thing in this moment.", "NTA \n\nYou did the right thing by not going to the wedding. The groom did not invite you. The bride did not invite you, either. The friend might want some drama and thus, invited you. I don't buy the \"I don't remember\" act from your friend.\n\nAnd btw, has the audacity been on sale lately because why on Earth do people around you had  to give you their 2 cents when you didn't ask for it? Oh, the free time! \n\nOP, you need to know that only you get to live your life. You went through a messy break up with that guy and that is a unique experience to you. None of those people who have been messaging you and your friend got to live this life of yours and because of that, they don't know what happened. They however can empathise but in this case, they chose drama. \n\nYou go live your happy life, OP. Don't let them get into your head.", "NTA. Your friend put everybody in a potentially really uncomfortable situation. That's not your fault. She should have accepted your reason for not wanting to attend gracefully and allowed you to bow out without making a big deal out of it.", "NTA\n\nBizarre they\u2019d try to guilt you when you\u2019ve explained you\u2019re not comfortable. Why invite that to your wedding?", "You're friend is MESSY. She knew what she was doing. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like the whole + 1 thing was very sus from your friend. Going to the wedding would be weird especially as you had a messy breakup with the groom. Everyone telling you you\u2019re trying to pull focus can fuck off.", "Nope", "[deleted]", "YTA you said it yourself early in the post, \"an ex of mine\" I know it may seem small, but you not referring to them as your ex, just an ex tells me it wasn't that big a relationship, he was just a guy you dated for a few weeks or a couple of months. You didn't even mention if you 2 had been exclusive by the time it ended? Based on how little info you give on your relationship it's pretty obvious that it was a nothing burger with a side of who cares and now you're drama farming by blowing it out of proportion. \n\nIt was nothing when it happened, it's been long enough that he's found someone else, dated them, gone exclusive, gotten engaged, and now is getting married and you ARE trying to make it all about you.", "So you can't set your own history aside to enjoy a free meal and good food with your girlfriend? That doesn't make sense to me. NAH.", "INFO: is it a destination wedding? Will your friend still be able to afford to go if you bail? You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to go if it would make you uncomfortable, but if it means your friend can\u2019t go I kind of understand why they\u2019d be upset at you dropping out last minute.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But probably bride more.\n\nI mean nobody would want this to happen in a wedding. A guest who is wildly uncomfortable and which makes groom uncomfortable and also bride.\n\nThey don't seem to be very nice people.", "The bride's opinion is the only one that matters here. You're doing the right thing.", "And probably quietyly relieved.", "Have you looped the bride back into all this negative feed back? Seems plausible something bigger might be going on.", "Maybe the \u201cfriend\u201d has/had some issue with the bride or groom and wants to stir up drama?\nOp=NTA", "NTA OP.  You TOTALLY did the right thing and showed much maturity in respecting that this was your Ex's and his bride to be day.  Also agree with others that your, hopefully, ex friend was trying to start or hoping there would be some type of drama from your attending.  Edited to say and you also need to dump those other so-called friends who are saying you are an A\ud83d\udd73.\n\nMy best friend's (whom I think of and call her Sister) brother, whom I was in a relationship with and it didn't end well, got married last year.  She called me up afterwards to apologize because she wanted me to be her plus one but didn't want to hurt neither one of us by my being there.  I told her she did the right thing because even if she had asked me to go, I would have turned the invite down.  This was his and her day and I wouldn't have wanted to attend knowing that both of us would have been uncomfortable.  And like you, I hope they are very happy.", "Exes is the plural (no apostrophe), but you\u2019re only talking about a single ex, so you shouldn\u2019t be using the plural.", "Definitely. I was just curious why the friend is so upset.", "[removed]", "NTA but lots of other judgemental assholes who should mind their own business.", "If I were the groom, I would've thought OP was intentionally trying to go even though she wasn't invited. Like \"haha, you didn't invite me but I have a friend to take me as a plus 1!\"", "I have a feeling the friend WANTS OP to be in an awkward position, hurt her feelings or just thrives off drama in the first place.", "Or take one of the people who are telling OP she's in the wrong", "[removed]", "Yeah, what is going on behind the scenes here that OP doesn't know about? Why are so many people invested in her attendance at random wedding where she vaguely knows one host and dated the other?", "Utterly confused by why anyone would care. She\u2019s not in the bridal party and probably no one would care about her presence/absence in any way. The wedding has nothing to do with her.", "OP, is the friend trying to pull a rom-com because they hate the bride?", "It does - doesn't even matter who her actual target was in bringing an ex of the groom.  And I think the tell is that she got a bunch of people to contact OP after the adults resolved the issue.", "Yes, funny how the bride is the most level-headed of all", "Seriously.  Why do any of these people care if OP goes to the wedding other than stirring drama?", "I do shit like this all the time", "I'm dumb I guess! Thanks for the correction though", "Fair!", "If the ending was messy, his feelings don't matter. OP is trying to avoid trouble, and how do we know he wasn't the one who made it messy?!", "I agree, it seems the friend just wanted to see what would happen.", "Sounds like a set up to me.", "Another possibility is that they're getting tired of juggling OP and her Ex, and are finding it mentally exhausting making sure that they never share space together, and thinking about whose turn it is to \"get\" the friend group.  \n\nHowever, ambushing both of them to force them to get to a place where they can all hang out together is not the answer.  \n\nThis is the risky part of dating within a friend group.  The group may have to accept that they're never going to be the old gang again under the circumstances of a breakup.  Not everyone can get to that point.", "That\u2019s what I don\u2019t get about stuff like this. Everyone who is going is going to have a fun time whether or not OP is there. The only problem is OP\u2019s shitty friend trying to rally troops to guilt her into going for whatever reason.", "Yes, you're looking for the possessive form, \"ex's\" as in \"my ex's wedding\" meaning \"the wedding of my ex\".\n\nBut still NTA.", "His feelings don\u2019t matter at HIS own wedding? How do you figure that", "Lol", "Absolutely agree", "\"At his own wedding\" is doing **all** of the lifting in that sentence. \n\nOP is not obligated to go. His feelings don't matter in regards to OP not wanting to go. \n\nHave the day you deserve."]}
