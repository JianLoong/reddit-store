Since this is a rental, the best thing to do would be check with the landlord about what options are available for your situation.  It may be that to most you can do is put up a light diffusing curtain over your patio door for privacy's sake.", "NTA for thinking this, but you don't own the property, so you can't just build a fence.  Well, not a permanent fence...................\n\nGet some large plant pots with tall plants - set them up in a row around the back of your house giving yourself a bit of enclosed space, but essentially 'blocking' people from walking too close to your house such that they can see into your windows.  You are allowed to have plant pots - they aren't permanent and if you get tall wide ones, people can't just step over them.", "Well -- by the sounds of it you rent the property so its not your property to put a fence up - you would have to get your landlord to do it.", "They can go through their houses. If your landlord says you can put up a fence the do it", "Thanks everyone! I really like the potted plant idea and I've found some really cute trellis planter boxes that might do the trick as well as give some privacy! I should have clarified that I have already received approval from the rental property manager for a fence so all I need to do is hire a company to do the land survey and installation. The yard situation is that the townhomes have small yards that back up to a tree line at a creek bed. Hope that makes sense!", "First, as a renter, you would need to ask your landlord.\n\nIt may go against the home owners association rules if it is a development of town houses.", "Your question isn't relevant here.  You live in a rental--you can want or not want to put up a fence but it doesn't matter because the decision isn't yours to make.  You don't own the home/property.", "NTA but\u2026\n1. It\u2019s a rental. Only your landlord can put the fence  in. \n2. There\u2019s city/ municipal codes you have to abide by for fences. If you\u2019re \u201cland-locking\u201d your neighbors, I can almost 1000% guarantee your proposed fence would be rejected.", "NTA. That is creepy and they are incredibly rude.", "A fence as you describe it is likely not going to happen.  Take the advise of placing tall potted plants in place of a fence.", "They can go through their house and if they aren\u2019t respecting boundaries it might be your only choice. Speak to them first and maybe put up some planters and create a softwall first.", "NTA: You aren't cutting them off from their yard. They can access their yard from their back door. They just won't be able to cut through your yard anymore and you can put some nice patio furniture there.", "NTA, they can go around the outside of the building the other way, or go through their house.", "NTA. Maybe just ask to fence in part of the yard.", "NTA, thats the nature of terrace houses", "YTA. This is a rental. Never install anything without talking with the owner first AND **make sure you respect all right of ways**. In row homes, neighbours usually have the right to use your land to get in/out their backyards, so this man probably has the right to go through your yard and you cannot do anything about it.", "You could always leave a tiny path perhaps?  \nWithout a diagram it\u2019s hard to know. \n\nTry talking to them first or putting up a small wire decretive fence that\u2019s like a foot high.", "Your yard, your fence.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. You knew what you might be getting into when you moved there and you\u2019re ill about young kids behaving like kids.

You talk to your landlord but don't be surprised if the landlord says no or makes you provide an easement of some sort.\n\nUntil then do as others have recommended and get potted privacy plants. You can also get privacy window cling screens.", "NTA for wanting to do this, but don\u2019t. Talk to landlord first and if it\u2019s a no-can-do situation, put up a faux fence with plants or something.", "NTA. Get a survey done, get a permit and put up a fence.  As long as you do everything legally, don\u2019t worry about them.   They shouldn\u2019t be walking in your yard and looking into your house.\n\nETA: just realized you are a rental in the row.  That complicates things.  Maybe get some good window coverings and put up some small property barriers\u2026my dad uses garden barriers\u2026to identify between the two properties.

Definitely NTA for wanting privacy on your own home/yard.", "Or even some of those smaller garden decorative fencing.", "For the life of me I cannot figure out what she means by cutting them off from their yard. My understanding of rowhouses is that they are a number of units sharing walls with the other units, except for the ones on the ends. The front doors are all in a row, so to speak, facing the street. And the back doors or patios doors are all in the back of the building, in a row, with the respective backyards a continuation of their unit? Like houses but squished together sharing at least one wall. If she has the corner unit and fences in the area that is her yard, one side of the fence would be closest to the neighbor and the parallel side of the fence would be next to a sidewalk/perpendicular road? Is she landlocking them from reaching the sidewalk? Is there a walkway that runs behind all the units connecting it to the sidewalk? If so, then she should not block it with a fence. The walkway was put there for a reason. If it is just grass, then I guess it would be okay. They can just use their front door. We definitely need more explanation or a diagram.", "Yikes... this is a rental. So it's still the owner's yard.\n\nAannnnd... townhouses usually have right of way. So while it's this property's yard, neighbourgs might be entitle to walk on it. OP probably can't even install a fence because she needs to let space for the neighbourg to cross the yard.", "I like these. But don't run all the way to the back of your property and no one will be landlocked", "I don\u2019t know the terminology, but for townhouses like that, there is essentially an easement for the the interior neighbors to allow them to get their lawn mower or wheelbarrows full to soil to their backyards without going through the house.", "I re-read it and she said they can\u2019t reach their own yard from the back door? I am even more confused. If she literally means that, then YTA", "It sounds like they\u2019d *only* be able to get to their yard through their back door. \n\nWhich means no way out of their yard in an emergency, no way to get any type of equipment in (power or water, firefighters etc). And anything that doesn\u2019t fit through their doors, wouldn\u2019t be able to be moved into the back yard (or if it\u2019s already there *out of*. \n\nSo if they have grill back there that can\u2019t fit through the door, they\u2019d have to leave it there when they move etc?", "The way I read it, is that they would need to go through their house to get to their backyard - which is normal for even regular houses.  Like you said, maybe she could just put a fence around an area close to her house, leaving some space nearer the back of the lot for them to get to their yards.\n\nEDIT: I drew up a little sketch of my best understanding of the situation...  https://ibb.co/kBgnrH2", "Most normal houses have some sort of side gate to get into the yard though."]}
