My Dad comes from a very wealthy family, and my Mom comes from nothing. Their relationship has always been rocky. (Ex: they used to be abusive towards each other, my Mom cheated early in their relationship, argued a lot, etc.). My Mom is a raging narcissist & my Dad had a history of alcoholism and substance abuse (clean for over 20 years). I (F17) am here since he wanted someone to inherit his money. I grew up watching them fight, and my goal is not to put either parent in a bad light. My parents were never married, but they\u2019re living in separate houses (my Dad owns both).\n\nNow to the problem, my Mom started a new job a couple of years ago where she met a guy (we\u2019ll call him Tim). She would text with Tim outside of work when she first started to ask him about her training, but it is something different now. They are deeply in love. Also Tim has a wife and kids of his own. My Mom goes on dates with Tim, rents hotel rooms, secretly takes off work to see each other \u2013 one of my friends sent me a picture of him going inside our house when my Mom said she had a doctor\u2019s appointment that day. There isn\u2019t a time when she isn\u2019t texting Tim. \n\nI told my Dad when everything first started (about 9 months ago) because I saw them saying they loved each other, and I felt that he deserved to know. My Dad took it very hard. He\u2019s spent nights crying wondering why he isn\u2019t enough, and even blatantly asked her what he could do better. However, she denies the cheating claims and always says, \u201cWe\u2019re only friends. Dry\\_Research3220 has friends that are guys, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s sleeping with them!\u201d \n\nSince then, my Dad has changed his will to give me complete ownership of both properties after he dies. Recently, my Mom had me doing something on her phone, and I admit I am an AH. I gave in and started reading her texts with Tim. I felt upset. She was talking about how once my Dad dies, they\u2019ll never have to worry about money & she plans on having an account with both of their names so he can spend whatever he wants because \u201cno one has ever loved her as he does.\u201d She talked about how she was staying with my Dad for me and the money. If my parents were to split completely, my Dad would leave her with almost nothing. He told me he still wants her to have some money because she raised me.\n\nI want to tell my Dad this information, and I have pictures. I want to tell him that she doesn\u2019t deserve as much as she\u2019s getting because she\u2019s only pretending to love him to have money to do things with Tim. My Dad already gives her 3K a month for expenses, and she always yells at him, saying she doesn\u2019t get enough. The issue with telling him is that he wouldn\u2019t be able to be quiet about it. He\u2019d tell my Mom, and then her wrath would fall upon me. IDK if this is important, but she\u2019s getting around 8 mil USD.

If your dad decides to give you more, have him set it up in a trust that she can't get to. Also, just a thought, but maybe encourage him to set up a trust for her that gives her $3k a month for the rest of her life so she can maintain her lifestyle.
