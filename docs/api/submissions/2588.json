This is a company problem. I don\u2019t think you were negligent but I would say the same thing if you were negligent. If HR opens a case then that further proves it\u2019s a company problem. If it wasn\u2019t a company problem then management would have told him to sue you. And all HR can do is write you up or fire you. They can\u2019t withhold your pay (at least in the US).

Maybe this is an unfair judgement, but surely if it was the co-workers desk for the day, and the OP\u2019s desk for the day, co-worker is responsible for the damage as the laptop was not within the \u2018confinements\u2019 of their desk when it was damaged, and that is on the co-worker.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, it wouldn't hurt to find out your company's policy on doing work on personal devices. A lot of companies view that it is a huge no-no. I suggest that in case they try to shake you down for money, you can point this out to them. I wouldn't bring it up unless it escalates.  I would otherwise avoid them for the interim but do take time stamped notes of any contact or discussions. \n\nAlso, I would imagine there are cameras and it can be proven that it was an accident.", "NTA.

Honestly, I'm kinda surprised your company allows you to use personal items at work for company work.", "I'll go with NTA.\n\nIt would have been nice if you offered to pay for the laptop, but I don't think it would be required for several reasons. I would think your company might prohibit the use of personal laptops for work, and it is not certain that he was using it for work rather than watching YouTube or something.\n\nAnother reason is that your company should have purchased the motorized desks that have a collision avoidance system. Those systems stop the desk if it hits anything. If someone's hand had been injured by the desk, I would think your company would be held responsible.\n\nFinally, I think your coworker was negligent for leaving his laptop open, hanging over the edge of the desk, and unattended. It should not have been positioned in such a way that it would interfere with your desk. Leaving it unattended is dumb, as it could have been stolen unless it was locked down. Even if it was locked down, it is possible that someone could have tampered with it or viewed personal information stored on it.", "His laptop was on his desk but open enough to where it extended beyond the desk, then left unattended.

I mean bringing a personal laptop even though he has pc from work. Leaving it open and placing it under your desk. He knows how those desks work.

It did not magically move into their neighbors space. Their neighbor moved their laptop partially into OPs cubicle and it was beneath their desk, with a noise panel between them.\n\nI'm having a really hard time how you're not grasping that OP didn't \"move out of their space\", their desk only moved vertically, there was no horizontal or diagonal movement from his desk. Their neighbors stuff was underneath his desk because he slid it past the confines of his own space into OPs.", "I think the desks are like next to each other, like the work spaces are mirrored. and there is a gap between the desks but because laptop screens can be pushed to a somewhat diagonal angle, co-worker accidentally pushed it too far, it\u2019s accidentally crossed this gap and then been crushed.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is under anyones desk, it is just the laptop screen, not even the whole laptop, and it\u2019s only because it is up at the time i believe", "As I stated to you a second ago, again, the laptop and screen were both crushed. Please explain to me how that ended up happening if OP\u2019s screen was the only thing dangling between his desk and OP\u2019s. This is more than minimal damage. He crushed his coworker\u2019s entire laptop and he says so himself. I guess that there are people out there who sit awkwardly on the edge of their desk so far to where their laptop could topple over? Because if that\u2019s not the case, I just don\u2019t see that making any sense. No one in their right mind would work this way. OP is trying to save face and justify their own actions since they were clearly negligent.", "Okay, riddle me this then.\n\n>\u201dI lowered my desk after my meeting and heard a crunch, my other coworker behind me and I immediately went to look. I raised my desk and found the **laptop and its screen damaged**.\u201d\n\n>Please tell me how you came to the conclusion that just the coworker\u2019s screen was damaged because OP clearly states the laptop itself was also damaged.\n\n>This means that OP was directly over more than just the coworker\u2019s screen that was sitting at an angle. He literally had his desk sitting over his coworker\u2019s screen and crushed the entire thing.\n\n>No one would seriously put their entire laptop in between desks to sit right under someone else\u2019s desk. If more than just the screen was crushed, OP was hovering over it entirely. No one sits at a desk like that.\n\nPray tell how the entire laptop just so happened to end up crushed if he wasn\u2019t literally parked over his coworker\u2019s desk.", "But it\u2019s not just the screen. We are talking about an entire laptop. OP didn\u2019t just crush a screen dangling between his desk. He crushed his coworker\u2019s screen and the laptop itself.\n\n>I lowered my desk after my meeting and heard a crunch, my other coworker behind me and I immediately went to look. I raised my desk and found the **laptop and its screen damaged**. \n\nHe was literally so much over his coworker\u2019s desk, he crushed more than just the screen. How do you explain that? No one would have the brilliant idea to work on their laptop directly under someone\u2019s standing desk. Again, is implausible.", "Hey, totally loving having this discussion with you btw because it has really gotten me thinking on this! But, maybe, the OP means \u2018and the laptop\u2019 in regards to something along the lines of because the screen is now broken, so is the rest of the laptop? I am just getting this impression as OP clarifies in the comments that \u2018it (the desk) cracked the corner of his screen as my desk was coming down\u2019 and also says \u2018on his laptop screen\u2019 in a different comment.\nMaybe OP just worded the main body of the story or the comments poorly, but this was what fuelled my take on it and why I think it was ultimately the co-worker who left his laptop in a bit of a crappy position, personally :)"]}
