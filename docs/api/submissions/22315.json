I do the majority of the housework at home (which is another can of worms, but I digress) My husband and I also have an 8 year old daughter who is involved in extracurricular things and of course school. Needless to say, by Saturday, I am wiped out and I like to sleep in a little. And every weekend, my husband is up earlier than I would like to be and begins making passive aggressive comments towards me with my daughter about how her mom just wants to sleep all day and not go get breakfast. The funny thing is, most of these days, my daughter doesn\u2019t even want to go out for breakfast. She\u2019s content with just chilling on the couch for an hour or so after she wakes up, but her father regularly wants her (and me) to immediately get dressed and go to town for breakfast as soon as our eyes open. He will also make out like it\u2019s much later than it is. For example this morning when I said \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep can y\u2019all please be quiet\u201d he said \u201cwell hell it\u2019s 9:00!\u201d, when it was 8:30. I was also up til midnight last night. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m wanting to sleep til noon. 9 is the absolute latest I would sleep anyway. Is that really so bad? So basically I never ever get to sleep in really. Even if my daughter isn\u2019t home, my husband is still waking me up and bothering me.

My dad used to be the same with the \"it's 9 am already\" yet it's still 8 am. That really annoys me. You're valid for wanting rest. \n\nAlso your husband making passive aggressive comments in front of your daughter isn't good. Children are impressionable. Hope you two get to talk about it between yourselves instead of him doing that.", "Even without knowing your husband's working hours, NTA, you need more rest and less housework.\n\nHe's being very insensitive and is consistently interrupting your sleep on purpose and insulting you in front of your child. If he's too exhausted as well, then he should communicate that so you can find a compromise, not behave like an AH.\n\nHe sounds toxic, terribly controlling and inconsiderate and I'm sorry you are being treated this way. But most of all, I'm sorry your daughter has to witness all this.", "NTA. Trade schedules for a couple of weeks and see how he feels getting up at 4 am to do housework because there's no time after work since he has to drive the kid around.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a baby/toddler that needs either of you at 6am, nobody is waking up through the night for feedings, and you fully pull your weight (and then some) during the week. Waking up at 9am on weekends doesn\u2019t make you a lazy lush, your husband needs to get a grip. (I fully expected you to say you were sleeping until noon, and I was gonna say that\u2019s ridiculous. But 9am?? Please.)", "NTA for wanting to sleep in one day a week. If he really wanted to go do things, he could go without you. I get what it\u2019s like always going going going, and just wanting a couple extra hours of sleep one day, ESPECIALLY with a kid. \nHave you had a conversation with him about the comments and how they get to you? \nDoes he go to bed earlier than you?", "NTA. What is wrong with you husband? Have you talked to him? What does he say? If I were you I would also give him a rate of his own medicine and start complaining everyday about all the housework you do.\n\nAnyways, why do you tolerate doing all the housework? Maybe start there and stop dosing his laundry md stuff until he understands.", "NTA. Your husband sounds exhausting, selfish and inconsiderate. If he\u2019s bored while you\u2019re sleeping, that sounds like a great time for him to do the housework he\u2019s been leaving on your plate.\n\nTalking poorly about you to your daughter is absolutely unacceptable and badgering you to go out to breakfast just because he wants to is incredibly immature. Time to set some serious, hard boundaries.", "NTA. People need sleep and rest. Although you didn\u2019t go into it, the housework issue probably plays a big role in your need for rest. Would you be upset if your husband and daughter went to breakfast without you? Or, could he go by himself? He could even fix himself a snack and you could go out for brunch/lunch. It\u2019s unfair for him to make an issue of your wanting to recuperate from a long week when doing so doesn\u2019t affect him.", "I am a night owl and like to sleep in until 10 on the weekends. I work an office job so get up earlier than my natural time M-F and want my weekend lie in. People get judgey about those of us who go to bed later and like to wake up after 9 am so let me say that I have a successful career, keep a clean house, put time into my relationship, etc. I  am a fully functioning adult whose sleeping patterns are just different from most people\u2019s.\n\nMy ex used to start poking me at 7 on weekends because he wanted me up and to ready to do things with him. He would also playfully say I was lazy which he meant, he just wanted the out to tell me he was joking and not own the comment. He wanted me to golf with him and while I can play, I don\u2019t like to, nor did I appreciate the sexist and racist tools at his country club. I explained my sleeping needs, how I felt about him bugging me, and tried to compromise on weekend plans. When that fell on deaf ears, I started waking him up (he was an early bird and liked to be in bed by 9 while I go to bed at 12-2 every night) at 11 pm every Friday and Saturday night telling him he was lazy, I had plans for us to go out, etc. I did that for three weekends before he threw in the towel and left me in peace on weekend mornings.\n\nThat being said, he\u2019s an ex for a reason. I mean, chilling with misogynistic wankers at a country club is enough of a reason to leave him, but he continually showed a lack of appreciation for my needs and put himself first in most aspects of our relationship.", "We have a 4 and 2 year old and I haven\u2019t slept in since their births lol.. we did sleep in till 852 today but only because the kids slept in due to getting over recent sickness and catching up on sleep.. it\u2019s been nice ha.\n\nNTA, but I personally don\u2019t expect to sleep in unless the kids are not with us and with their grandparents for a weekend (happens a few times a year)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband seems to have some control issues. You guys need to sit down and have an adult conversation about it and find a compromise. Maybe you sleep in on Saturdays and you do family breakfast every Sunday.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t your husband go with daughter for breakfast?", "NTA. These posts make me more and more thankful for my partner. I\u2019m a SAHM and he works a LOT but when he\u2019s off on the weekends (he isn\u2019t always) he always gets up first and gets to the baby before I even hear a peep. God I love that man more and more every day.", "I disagree that housework is a separate can of worms. If your husband is shaming you for resting or napping AND you are his unpaid maid that's all part of the same very entitled disrespectful attitude that doesn't see you as a human and an equal.", "NTA but your husband is.  He's also misogynistic and controlling.\n\nYou need a conversion about this and housework.", "Yes I 100% get sleep shamed. And it\u2019s something that I myself feel shame for. I get embarrassed sometimes for needing naps to function and get down on myself for not being able to keep up with all the housework because I legit just run out of energy. I\u2019ve even had blood work done to find out if something is wrong with me because I\u2019m so tired all the time. Everything always comes back normal. Working out gives me energy, so since I started that, I feel better overall. But a girl still needs her naps! I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m just a sleepy person and that\u2019s okay.", "Yeah he always says he\u2019s just joking and coming at it from a place of humor\u2026but when he does this it always feels like okay maybe you\u2019re just playing around but I can tell there\u2019s some truth behind it too. Like deep down, he\u2019s seriously irritated.", "That\u2019s funny you say that because I\u2019ve stopped doing his laundry before and he eventually started doing that more when he was constantly out of clothes \ud83e\udd23 he does some things around the house, so it\u2019s not like he does nothing, but the majority is still on me I feel. But regardless of that like dude just let me sleep a couple of hours!!!", "I know that feeling! It wasn\u2019t until the last year or so that my daughter became old enough to do her own thing for a little bit in the morning if she wakes really early. So glad you got to sleep in today though!", "Nope NTA. You have a heavy schedule. Even sleeping till noon on the weekend wouldn't be out of order. I had a 4 hour commute for a couple of years & I'd basically sleep most of the weekend because I was exhausted. You need to have a talk with the hubs about your needs, his insensitive comments, and the housework sharing.\n\nAs an aside I cured my mom of this sort of thing while I was in college. She was always  an early riser with the attitude that people sleeping late are lazy. She came in trying to wake me up for a class that the prof had cancelled. I told her in no uncertain terms that I was an adult (a whole big 19!), I knew my schedule, & if she ever tried that again I'd stay in bed all day no matter if I had a class or not.", "I had this issue, OP, and my doctor ran more specific blood work (I was also losing hair and it was partly post partum and partly because I\u2019d been really sick after a bad gallbladder removal surgery) and it came back as a vitamin D deficiency\u2026 I started taking vitamin D gummies and it it helped SO much. So if you\u2019re so busy with work and other things, you may not be getting enough vitamin D from things or the sun. Of course this is just my experience and I\u2019m no doctor but I was really surprised at how much I changed once I started taking those vitamins.", "I understand jokes but saying \"oh your mom sleeps all day\" doesn't sound that good. You wouldn't want your child to pick that up right? Maybe you can talk to him to see if there's something up. If there's some irritation there maybe you could discuss what a weekend should be like. Tell him you really need the extra sleep and that you could get breakfast after.", "Sit him down and have a discussion with him about his negative remarks to you and your daughter about you. Don't let him get away with \"it's just a joke\", tell him no one finds it funny and it needs to stop. Talk to him about division of labour and areas he need to improve. He needs to understand you are exhausted and this is not sustainable. Good on the laundry strike.", "ESH. You both are in the wrong here because you are not compromising with each other to make sure each of you get free time and share the family load. It really sounds like your 4 am exercise routine, your kid's abundant extracurriculars, the division of house work, and your expectations of each other aren't working. You two aren't communicating and that is *both* of your problems.", "NTA - but have you considered waking him up whenever you get up - so he doesn\u2019t get to be \u2018lazy\u2019 and sleep in after 4 am, when you want to be up and about - oh and every time you do some house work make a point of interrupting whatever he is or isn\u2019t doing and  saying - come on - don\u2019t be lazy, housework / chore time\u2019", "NTA. He sounds annoying.", "NTA and he should just take the kid to breakfast himself if she\u2019s up too and will go. That could be some Dad/daughter bonding time!\n\nFrankly even if you were 50/50, it would be fine to want to sleep in Sat, especially if he\u2019s up to do any needed kid stuff anyway (and she\u2019s 8 so frankly could be up by herself probably, for most purposes). Your husband is fussing about a non-problem.", "NTA\n\nHe could take your daughter out to breakfast just him and her for daddy-daughter bonding time. Tell her mommy gets to sleep in because she works hard taking care of the family all week. That's what a caring and considerate husband and father would do. He's just controlling and passive-aggressive. You deserve to sleep in on the weekends.", "NTA. Itd be one thing if you were always sleeping in while he had to pick up the slack with your daughter and her activities, but if she also is just hanging out at home most weekends, on top of you not even sleeping past 9am, its not on you to indulge let alone explain yourself when youre the one also paying the bills. If your husband feels the need to do something the second his eyes are open every single day, thats on him, but dont make him make you feel bad because you Dare to want to sleep a little longer than him when it negatively effects nothing.", "It takes more effort to sleep shame you than it does to just leave you alone and let you sleep. My entire family learned the hard way to let me sleep in on weekends. They are all early birds and I am a night owl so I don't feel it's asking too much to get to sleep in on the weekends. You are NTA but your husband sure is a big one.", "NTA. My dad is like this. If he's up, he thinks everyone should be up. Even if you're a guest in their house on vacation! He's up by 6, loudly making coffee, banging cabinet doors, clanking spoons. He also gets their dogs and parrot going in the morning. My mom finally had to (angrily) tell him to go get breakfast by himself. So now he does, and she gets to sleep. \n\nOp, tell your husband to go enjoy his early morning breakfast on his own. He can bring you something back.", "NTA \nWake him up at 4 am. during the week and tell him that he has to get up and fix breakfast. (Being petty).", "NTA. Tell your husband you've done one of those ancestral kits and discovered you're highly Spanish so it's in your genes to have siesta on weekends.\n\nPS; No hate, I'm a Spaniard myself", "That\u2019s usually what ends up happening. But it always feels like like that irritates him. Because he\u2019ll give this exasperated sigh and be like \u201cwell I guess me and *childs name* will just go\u2026\u201d", "Ok just because it\u2019s a joke doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t still disturb your sleep and he keeps doing it? Jokes are only funny when everyone\u2019s laughing. It\u2019s obviously some weird power play. \n\nJust wait until your daughter becomes a teenager and he tries to play this game with her. Hopefully the hormones teach him a lesson finally. \n\nOr you could just be firm with him and tell him to do the chores and let you sleep in one day of the week.", "Adding on this good advice.... Ask him to imagine his daughter's husband talking to her this way and whether he thinks it's okay. She will grow up thinking this is just how women are treated."]}
