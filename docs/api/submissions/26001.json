My bf headed to the kitchen and walked into the door handle. I could tell it hurt but he tried to brush it off, I didn't make a big deal as I know he doesn't like attention being brought to things like that. But my parents got concerned and checked on him.\n\nAs the day went on a few more small things happened. Each time my parents would check on him. Near the end of the night, after we had had a few drinks, we were both walking and he accidentally walked into me, after my parents checked up on him again I could tell he was getting a bit uncomfy so we stepped outside.\n\nMy drunk SIL followed us, she started angrily telling me to get my bf under control, he wasn't the only one here to see my parents and that he kept taking all the attention and he needed to stop being such a pick-me girl and that he was being clumsy on purpose.\n\nMy already tipsy bf got pretty upset, he had been uncomfy at the level of attention and concern my parents had been giving him, he had been called clumsy by his parents all the time as a kid, so he started to tear up, which made him feel worse bc he hates crying (something he also use to get in trouble for)\n\nMy SIL made another comment, how now he's crying so he can get all the attention and I yelled at her, my parents had been talking to her all day and while they had been checking up on my bf when he has hurt himself, they have given her plenty of attention and, using her own words against her, she wasn't the only one here to see my parents.\n\nShe then started crying and ran inside to get my brother, he came out pissed that I upset his wife, but calmed down as soon as he saw me comforting my bf. He told me that he\u2019d call me later and got his wife and they left.\n\nI called a ride home and apologised to my parents, thanking them for having us over, they tried to comfort my bf again but I told them hes uncomfortable with people checking up on him, to which they apologised but I told them it was fine as they didnt know.\n\nMe and my brother have yet to have that call and my SIL has been texting me saying that i was now causing problems with her marriage and that i should have stayed out of it since this didnt concern me and was an issue between her and my bf as hes, in her words, obviously jealous my parents like her better than him.

You sometimes just...hit things when moving places. Either in passing, or because it clipped your extremities, and it...fuckin hurts, but you just move on and deal with it. You get bruises and cuts, but it's all minor shit as far as you're concerned. So, the attention isn't asked for or needed.\n\nHowever, the fact that your SIL is so grotesquely self-conscious about someone paying attention to this to the point that she invents in her head a whole scenario of intent surrounding it? The fact that she's just going off about it even now? Not only is this pick-me behaviour, but I'd place good money that this that kind of woman who says, \"I don't really have girl friends, because girls cause so much drama and play mindgames,\" when she herself is the one's causing drama and playing games in all of the occasions she claims otherwise.\n\nThe fact that your brother went from pissed to, \"oh...yea, ok, wife-chan lied again\" in his head upon seeing your boyfriend distraught implies this to be true.

That might not be possible if he's falling, hurting himself, etc in your parent's home because they have at least some obligation to ensure he's ok (at least that he doesn't need medical attention as they may need to alert their insurance).

But it gets used differently a lot.\n\nI've seen plenty of NLOG being thrown at women/girls who are just gender nonconforming and not affixing \"everyone is valid and cute uwu\" to every display of their nonconformity.\n\nExample: \"Makeup is for sl/ts?\" Everyone will agree that is NLOG sentiment. \"I personally don't wear makeup, but everyone's choice is valid\" is good and unproblematic, opposite of NLOG. \"Makeup feels terrible on your skin, I don't understand how other women can stand it\", \"I feel fake, not like me in makeup\" are both statements that I've seen both IRL and online described as NLOG. But neither is really rooted in sexism: first one is obviously sensory issues, the other one preference for maybe more minimalistic or even masculine expression. Both could probably offend someone who likes makeup, but people are allowed to have messy feelings about gender norms being forced on them.\n\nI understand internalized misogyny is a thing, but I am very suspicious of this trend that if you're not happily fitting female stereotypes you're actually sexist. You're allowed to say you don't like yellow or green or black, but say you don't like pink and, oh, come on, you're still in that dumb teen special phase? All non-sexist women like pink. Or one book club I used to be in had a shitstorm because if you like horror/crime fiction more than romance, you got brainwashed by the patriarchy into believing stories about women getting hurt are greater literature than stories about women being happy.

You should also probably tell you parents to chill a bit with the overt concern about the clumsiness induced injuries. Its embarrassing to constantly have your disability brought up.

In essence it's about putting other women down for having traditionally female interests all for the purpose of male validation (men will like me more if I like what men like).

The hard part about this is, it's usually more subtle (kind of like negging) in the sense it's usually some kind of backwards compliment. \n\nYou can tell the difference between a pick me/not like other girl and a girl who has traditionally more masculine interests very easily. Like for example, you talked about makeup. All of those suggestions you said are perfectly valid to say - although I could maybe see the fake thing being an issue (there was that whole era of take your girl swimming on your first date because makeup = fake and you needed to see what she actually looked like under that). A better example would be \"oh my god you put so much makeup on, I could never do that - men like natural beauty more\". \n\nEssentially it's not entirely the comment that makes it a pick me/not like other girls comment, it's the intention behind it. If you're purposely into sports, or cars and hate the colour pink because it's what you think guys like, and continuously put down girls for not liking cars - you're one of them. If you like cars and hate pink but don't do it for validation or put other girls down for not liking those things - you're totally fine.", ">literally see any am I the asshole type subs and you'll see people discussing the meaning of gaslighting literally everytime\n\nAs I was reading this comment thread, I was thinking of \"gaslighting.\" People just really like buzzwords."]}
