You sometimes just...hit things when moving places. Either in passing, or because it clipped your extremities, and it...fuckin hurts, but you just move on and deal with it. You get bruises and cuts, but it's all minor shit as far as you're concerned. So, the attention isn't asked for or needed.\n\nHowever, the fact that your SIL is so grotesquely self-conscious about someone paying attention to this to the point that she invents in her head a whole scenario of intent surrounding it? The fact that she's just going off about it even now?

That might not be possible if he's falling, hurting himself, etc in your parent's home because they have at least some obligation to ensure he's ok (at least that he doesn't need medical attention as they may need to alert their insurance).

Everyone has main character syndrome", "Let's not do tagged call outs.", "i used uncomfy bc of the character limit, easy way to bring it down", "i know im not supposed to argue with comments, and im not arguing the judgement, just comments like this upset me. people with motor impairments shouldn't be allowed to drink? even in private property with family all around them? i know my bf, i know how he can handle his drinks and the stumble that caused him to walk into me wasn't alcohol related.\n\njust because someone has a disability doenst mean they shouldnt be able to engage in normal things like drinking with friends and family.", "Or that she cried after accusing the bf of being clumsy on purpose to get sympathy.", "NTA and your SIL sounds like a piece of work. \n\nAnd there are definitely lessons here for you and bf about how to accommodate his dyspraxia (which if he\u2019s recently diagnosed he\u2019s probably still coming to terms with). Some ideas from a fellow late-diagnosed dyspraxic. \n\nAgree that if he\u2019s ok with it a quiet chat with your parents would help. \n\nAlso sounds like he is carrying a fair bit of childhood trauma (not unusual for us ND folk) and might benefit from some support to work through this if he isn\u2019t already. I\u2019ve found movement and body based therapy super useful in my journey and absolutely effing hated CBT, but different ppl will have different experiences. \n\nAlso agree that some sessions with an OT wouldn\u2019t hurt. He might also find yoga or other movement practice helpful if it\u2019s in a totally non-judgemental space. Yoga really helped me know where my body is in space and what it can do and I\u2019m way less likely to trip over nothing now. But any hint of judgement and I was out of there. \n\nOne last thing - stress or distress messes with my spatial awareness massively (as does having my period). I will tell my partner that I\u2019m having a \u2018spatial awareness day\u2019 and he\u2019ll make sure he does the veg chopping or puts away the bone china mugs so I don\u2019t drop them.", "It's a gendered term because it doesn't mean seeking attention, it means parroting misogyny in order to gain the favor of the men by putting down other women.", "Pick me boy also exists as an expression, she could\u2019ve used it. It does have a slightly different connotation from pick me girl as far as I know, though, so perhaps the sil was actually being a misogynist by picking the expression that demeans girls, and now it makes me think she may very well had homophobic intentions too", "I see you\u2019ve commented elsewhere that comments about how ppl with motor issues shouldn\u2019t drink upset you - totally understand your frustration. \n\nAnd, it might be worth having a chat with bf about where and how he can drink safely without putting himself at risk of getting seriously injured. I don\u2019t drink and never have, so can\u2019t help a lot with this, but I do enjoy the increased range of grown-up non alcoholic options that have sprung up in recent years. If he likes the taste but not the effect, maybe that\u2019s a route to go down?", "That, plus the use of \"not like other girls\" as a \"feminist\" way to shit on gender nonconforming women (and some trans people)."]}
