Our boys are 9 and 8 and our girl is 6. SIL has an 8 year old boy and a 7 year old girl. My husband and I have always believed in exposing our kids to all foods, even junk, in moderation. We try to make food fun and to have it be something we enjoy. So the kids can have a bar of chocolate after dinner and we won't ever stop them or judge them for wanting that. But they will also eat healthy dinners. Sometimes we even have a junk food day if there's a celebration or a busy day and we'll just skip a bit of treating for a while to make up for it.\n\nOur kids are healthy, active and love food. They also help out with meal planning and food prep. They also drink soda and juice sometimes. Though lemon flavored water is a huge favorite in our home lol.\n\nSIL from the moment she saw our oldest with a piece of fruit or candy judged us for it and she said we were going to have fat kids with many health problems. She said our then 3 year old should not know what McDonald's or pizza was, that they should not be able to debate different flavors of ice cream (our boys), that they didn't need to taste juices. \n\nShe is a very strict parent on food. No fruit, no junk, nothing processed, nothing sweet and no drinks outside of water (plain). She and my husband have actually fought over this stuff before because she wanted him to have her kids for a few hours and he told her he had already promised the kids pizza and would not change the plans because her kids were there. Or because he brought up taking the kids Trick or Treating when her kids could hear.\n\nSo SILs kids are now in school and they constantly ask for sweet stuff and have tried to buy the snacks their parents don't allow. SIL has been dealing with more tantrums in her home over it and the kids saying they hate their parents. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we were at MIL and FILs house. SIL is quizzing my kids on stuff and at one point she was even trying to see what size clothes they wore. I asked her what the hell she was doing and she ranted and raved about how my kids were eating (because they ate all the food at ILs house without a problem which was a veggie stir fry) while her kids refused to eat and wanted junk. She said my kids should be fat little tubbos and it's not fucking normal. She goes off venting that her kids are obsessed with junk. I told her her being controlling was the reason for that and you cannot be so restrictive and expect the kids not to desire it. I said junk is a part of life and teaching how to include it in a healthy way is better than letting them see everyone else enjoy what they can't. She asked how I could blame her. I told her she's wound tight about it and her kids go to school and know other kids are not as restricted. She told me to fuck off.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687520226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gw9aw/aita_for_blaming_my_sils_kids_food_obsessions_on/", "score": 1076, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As someone who suffered from an eating disorder, what concerns me most about this post is that your SIL seems to equate healthy with thin.  Hence, quizzing your kids on their sizes and making the \u201ctubbos\u201d comment.  She is forcing extremely disordered eating on her children in an effort to keep them thin, which could adversely affect their development. She really needs therapy; I hope she gets it.", "NTA- at all.  This is parenting/human nature 101.  If kids don't know how to make healthy choices (about anything), they will rebel, get it elsewhere and eventually have lots of problems (Eating disorders, teenage drinking or sex, etc.).  As a parent, you, of course, want to teach your kids to eat healthy, be polite, etc.-- all the way up to teenage years where this gets a LOT trickier for them to navigate.  I had a roommate my Freshman year of college (very long ago) whose parents were very strict (read controlling- at 18, she had a 9 p.m. curfew, was not allowed to date, was punished severely when she had a sip of champagne at a cousin's wedding).  Well, guess what happened when she went to college? She went bananas- drinking every day, ditching class, sleeping (unsafely) with every guy she met- you get the idea.  She dropped out before the year was out when she got in trouble with the local police for drunken vandalism.  IOW, kids need to be taught to make good choices and what a healthy medium looks like (exactly what you are doing now- mine are 19 and 21 and both great with food, drink, etc.) and also how to self-correct (or when to come to you) when they mess up.  I feel bad for those kids.", "\u201cShe asked how could I blame her\u201d \n\nWho else is there to blame? Does she blame her kids??\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are teaching your children to have a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Your SIL is taking out her own food anxieties and weight insecurities on your children. Don't think of it as calling her controlling, think of it as protecting your children from her harmful mindset by pointing out behaviour you won't accept near your children. \n\nLess \"your kids are focused on junk food because you are setting up unhealthy boundaries, leave my children out of it\", more \"I will not allow you to size shame my children, you will not speak to them about what they eat, what they wear, or their behaviour. My children are healthy both physically and mentally and I will keep them that way for as long as I can. If you can't respect them, you cannot speak to them\"", "NTA. And you are correct.

I wasn't allowed sweets when I was a kid because I was at risk to develop diabete (according to the doctor who followed my brother and I when we were babies, almost 40 years later, no sign of either type of diabete). Now, I can't ever buy a bag of sweets, as I can't control myself when I have some available. I eat the whole pack in one go.

Or eliminating as much as possible.", "Yep. No fruit. Only veggies (including snacks).", "Yeah, that was enraging to me and even without her going so overboard what she said about my kids was when I was like no way are we staying in touch.", "Fruit = sugar\nSugar = bad\n\nThat is essentially where she comes from. She says that because our kids don't eat nothing but home grown veggies and organic meat like her family does. So of course the fact my kids eat pizza, ice cream, chocolate, candy and other kinds of things from time to time means they could not possibly also eat healthy.", "Yeah I imagine the kids will just be stopping at gas stations and hoarding food to their rooms.", "Honestly, that bit really disturbed me.  She has serious issues", "As someone who\u2019s mum is like this, her kids are gonna end up with eating disorders. She needs to stop projecting her insecurities and internalised diet culture on children", "She said that IN FRONT OF THEM!?", "Because it's sweet?", "NTA! Your SIL *does* know that every single carbohydrate ingested, whether from fruit, organic kale, or a Krispy Kreme donut, is converted into glucose \u2013 SUGAR! \u2013 for use by the brain, doesn't she? Fruit (moreso than store-bought juice) in moderation is a great source of fiber and nutrients, and is generally not too hard of a sell to get kids to eat; a higher glycemic load and/or index may be the trade-off, but that's an issue for the adult with Type 2 diabetes. Not healthy, active kids. And where does she get the idea that all vegetables are perfect? Celery is nutritionally bland. All the oxylate-laden vegetables have their own issues. And just because carrots are vegetables doesn't mean they are not super sugary. The same thing can be said of potatoes, which have a VERY high glycemic index of 100 (about the same as a Krispy Kreme donut), meaning the body converts it into glucose fast, causing an insulin spike as the body tries to react. \n\nAnd now that I think about it, I hope she's not restricting fats. We need all kinds of fats (even some saturated!) to make cells \u2013 including the suuuuper-important brain cells. \n\nYou are a good mom and a good aunt with great common sense about food as well as child-rearing. I hope science, evidence, or the difference between her results and yours get through to her. As long as she's bringing it up in conversation with you, you are right to push back in your own defense, as well as for the benefit of your nieces and nephews.

I had a friend who was like this with her daughter (not her son, just her daughter) and one time we took the daughter to a coffee shop and bought her and my daughter a muffin.
