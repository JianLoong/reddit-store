Our boys are 9 and 8 and our girl is 6. SIL has an 8 year old boy and a 7 year old girl. My husband and I have always believed in exposing our kids to all foods, even junk, in moderation. We try to make food fun and to have it be something we enjoy. So the kids can have a bar of chocolate after dinner and we won't ever stop them or judge them for wanting that. But they will also eat healthy dinners. Sometimes we even have a junk food day if there's a celebration or a busy day and we'll just skip a bit of treating for a while to make up for it.\n\nOur kids are healthy, active and love food. They also help out with meal planning and food prep. They also drink soda and juice sometimes. Though lemon flavored water is a huge favorite in our home lol.\n\nSIL from the moment she saw our oldest with a piece of fruit or candy judged us for it and she said we were going to have fat kids with many health problems. She said our then 3 year old should not know what McDonald's or pizza was, that they should not be able to debate different flavors of ice cream (our boys), that they didn't need to taste juices. \n\nShe is a very strict parent on food. No fruit, no junk, nothing processed, nothing sweet and no drinks outside of water (plain). She and my husband have actually fought over this stuff before because she wanted him to have her kids for a few hours and he told her he had already promised the kids pizza and would not change the plans because her kids were there. Or because he brought up taking the kids Trick or Treating when her kids could hear.\n\nSo SILs kids are now in school and they constantly ask for sweet stuff and have tried to buy the snacks their parents don't allow. SIL has been dealing with more tantrums in her home over it and the kids saying they hate their parents. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we were at MIL and FILs house. SIL is quizzing my kids on stuff and at one point she was even trying to see what size clothes they wore. I asked her what the hell she was doing and she ranted and raved about how my kids were eating (because they ate all the food at ILs house without a problem which was a veggie stir fry) while her kids refused to eat and wanted junk. She said my kids should be fat little tubbos and it's not fucking normal. She goes off venting that her kids are obsessed with junk. I told her her being controlling was the reason for that and you cannot be so restrictive and expect the kids not to desire it. I said junk is a part of life and teaching how to include it in a healthy way is better than letting them see everyone else enjoy what they can't. She asked how I could blame her. I told her she's wound tight about it and her kids go to school and know other kids are not as restricted. She told me to fuck off.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687520226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gw9aw/aita_for_blaming_my_sils_kids_food_obsessions_on/", "score": 2409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As someone who suffered from an eating disorder, what concerns me most about this post is that your SIL seems to equate healthy with thin.  Hence, quizzing your kids on their sizes and making the \u201ctubbos\u201d comment.  She is forcing extremely disordered eating on her children in an effort to keep them thin, which could adversely affect their development. She really needs therapy; I hope she gets it.", "NTA- at all.  This is parenting/human nature 101.  If kids don't know how to make healthy choices (about anything), they will rebel, get it elsewhere and eventually have lots of problems (Eating disorders, teenage drinking or sex, etc.).  As a parent, you, of course, want to teach your kids to eat healthy, be polite, etc.-- all the way up to teenage years where this gets a LOT trickier for them to navigate.  I had a roommate my Freshman year of college (very long ago) whose parents were very strict (read controlling- at 18, she had a 9 p.m. curfew, was not allowed to date, was punished severely when she had a sip of champagne at a cousin's wedding).  Well, guess what happened when she went to college? She went bananas- drinking every day, ditching class, sleeping (unsafely) with every guy she met- you get the idea.  She dropped out before the year was out when she got in trouble with the local police for drunken vandalism.  IOW, kids need to be taught to make good choices and what a healthy medium looks like (exactly what you are doing now- mine are 19 and 21 and both great with food, drink, etc.) and also how to self-correct (or when to come to you) when they mess up.  I feel bad for those kids.", "\u201cShe asked how could I blame her\u201d \n\nWho else is there to blame? Does she blame her kids??\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are teaching your children to have a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Your SIL is taking out her own food anxieties and weight insecurities on your children. Don't think of it as calling her controlling, think of it as protecting your children from her harmful mindset by pointing out behaviour you won't accept near your children. \n\nLess \"your kids are focused on junk food because you are setting up unhealthy boundaries, leave my children out of it\", more \"I will not allow you to size shame my children, you will not speak to them about what they eat, what they wear, or their behaviour.

I wasn't allowed sweets when I was a kid because I was at risk to develop diabete (according to the doctor who followed my brother and I when we were babies, almost 40 years later, no sign of either type of diabete).

Or eliminating as much as possible.", "Yep. No fruit. Only veggies (including snacks).", "Yeah, that was enraging to me and even without her going so overboard what she said about my kids was when I was like no way are we staying in touch.", "Fruit = sugar\nSugar = bad\n\nThat is essentially where she comes from. She says that because our kids don't eat nothing but home grown veggies and organic meat like her family does. So of course the fact my kids eat pizza, ice cream, chocolate, candy and other kinds of things from time to time means they could not possibly also eat healthy.", "Yeah I imagine the kids will just be stopping at gas stations and hoarding food to their rooms.", "Honestly, that bit really disturbed me.  She has serious issues", "As someone who\u2019s mum is like this, her kids are gonna end up with eating disorders. She needs to stop projecting her insecurities and internalised diet culture on children", "She said that IN FRONT OF THEM!?", "Because it's sweet?", "NTA! Your SIL *does* know that every single carbohydrate ingested, whether from fruit, organic kale, or a Krispy Kreme donut, is converted into glucose \u2013 SUGAR! \u2013 for use by the brain, doesn't she? Fruit (moreso than store-bought juice) in moderation is a great source of fiber and nutrients, and is generally not too hard of a sell to get kids to eat; a higher glycemic load and/or index may be the trade-off, but that's an issue for the adult with Type 2 diabetes. Not healthy, active kids. And where does she get the idea that all vegetables are perfect? Celery is nutritionally bland. All the oxylate-laden vegetables have their own issues. And just because carrots are vegetables doesn't mean they are not super sugary. The same thing can be said of potatoes, which have a VERY high glycemic index of 100 (about the same as a Krispy Kreme donut), meaning the body converts it into glucose fast, causing an insulin spike as the body tries to react. \n\nAnd now that I think about it, I hope she's not restricting fats. We need all kinds of fats (even some saturated!) to make cells \u2013 including the suuuuper-important brain cells. \n\nYou are a good mom and a good aunt with great common sense about food as well as child-rearing. I hope science, evidence, or the difference between her results and yours get through to her. As long as she's bringing it up in conversation with you, you are right to push back in your own defense, as well as for the benefit of your nieces and nephews.

I had a friend who was like this with her daughter (not her son, just her daughter) and one time we took the daughter to a coffee shop and bought her and my daughter a muffin.

Overdoing the \"health\" part and placing a lot of anxiety on FOOD (which is supposed to be enjoyable) is a sure way to stimulate avoidant behaviours when the kids become teenagers (buying junk food in secret, binging and purging, or just develop an unhealthy guilt-based relationship with food).   \nYour SIL should go see a psychologist, this out-of-control restrictiveness in the name of \"health\" has a name, and it's Orthorexia. She reminds me of my Mum when I was little. (We don't speak too often anymore)", "NTA. SiL is the one who isn't normal. Death row inmates probably have more freedom than her kids do.", "should have told her \"sucks to suck\", she sounds like the personification of a wet sock. nta.", "NTA she sounds very ignorant and knows nothing about what she's talking about.", "My college had an icecream machine (that was almost always broken) \n\nThe first day we were there a girl ate several bowls of icecream because she wasn't allowed it at home. She threw up.", "That is disordered eating.", "I know a 10 year old girl and what she really wants is a full slice of cake like everyone else gets. This is how you raise kids with eating disorders.", "If someone verbally abused my children like that, they would absolutely be out of our lives. No question.", "She\u2019s pissed they are healthy normal sized kids and can\u2019t wrap her head around how they can be, when they eat normally, and are not on the Nazi-no-fun-for-you diet like her kids. Her poor husband and kids.", "No way should she have examined their bodies the way she did.  My mother did that, it's partially why I have an eating disorder.  Her kids are likely going to end up needing some form of therapy, particularly once they are out of her grasp and they can control their food themselves.  Which they are going to struggle to do since they've never learned how to do it in the first place.", "I\u2019m surprised that the school would go along with your SILs ridiculous request, unless she lied to them claiming it\u2019s due to allergies. Maybe I\u2019m being naive but can the school really give in to that type of demand if the reason is not related to allergies/intolerances/sensory issues? I feel really bad for your niece and nephew. The \u201cdiet\u201d she has them on sounds like the keto diet. Guaranteed they\u2019re being teased at school about it.", "Agreed.  I always feel bad for the kids who lost the parent lottery.", "I absolutely love frozen grapes. I wish I had them as a kid! (I know it's off topic, just had to share lmao)", "My kids like watermelons. Very sweet and sticky but basically just empty foam. They'll take that as a summer treat over ice cream.", "Good bot", "I do not drink much milk but I do cook with it. Had some grits cooked with evaporated milk this am.", "Will cause? They already have an eating disorder, no? \n\nThey refused to eat the stir fry their grandparents prepared for the whole family. \nAfter a full day with their cousins (OP's kids), wouldn't they be too hungry to hold out for junk food?", "And when (sadly when, not if) her children become fat...\nGod. Those poor kids", "This is exactly how my mom was. And yes, it backfired. I have had a lifelong struggle with food and the feeling that my mom has only approved of me the few times in my life that I've been thin. One of those times being after a prolonged illness.", "Scurvy my friends. Scurvy. (And I know they won\u2019t actually get scurvy, because vitamin c is in vegetables and I think some meats, but I\u2019m not backing down.)", "Mate there are tons of studies on how milk is good for adult humans.  Drinking skim milk after weight training helps you build more muscle and lose more fat than soy of whey based protein drinks.\n\nGo google it.", "In my experience unconditional love is suddenly conditional after all, if you gain more weight that they think you should be allowed.\nAnd I'm not talking about sexual attraction.", "Restricting children from fruit, unless they have a medical condition such as allergy or something that requires it, is absolutely disordered. I say this as a huge proponent of healthy eating. We bake our own bread and don\u2019t buy things with added sugar. We try to eat clean and do avoid places like McDonald\u2019s and sodas. That being said we will fry chicken, go out of ice cream, and have birthday cake for breakfast the day after my kids birthday. I do try to buy alternatives that are healthy for day to day eating and we do avoid some highly processed junky foods (mostly because I don\u2019t like them) but to deny a child fruit is beyond insane. For me it\u2019s about better alternatives - like let\u2019s go to a nice place to eat for steak and mashed potato not McDonald\u2019s or Taco Bell.", "My jaw dropped at that part. Who denies their kids fruit?????", "While I understand the desire to go against the current norms for food because our society is out of control and we have an obesity epidemic, not allowing fruit for children is clearly disordered. And to never have any treats is very extreme, even if it\u2019s physically healthy and fine, psychologically given the society I would suggest she find alternatives and also have some less processed treats available so her kids don\u2019t suffer mentally. There is a high likelihood this will create a number of problems on the future. I feed my child very healthy, we are clean eaters day to day and I try to avoid processed foods. I bake my own bread and make my own sauce no sugar added. That being said we do have ice-cream sometimes  and go out to eat - no not McDonald\u2019s or Pizza Hut but to a nicer pizza place or to a nice burger place or steak place. My kid has no expressed any of the feelings her kids are expressing but she eats really healthy. I care about physical health but also mental health. I think that\u2019s where the SIL is making a mistake. I pur\u00e9e fruit to make popsicles, it clean, healthy, nutritious, and they are actually sweeter and more calories than regular popsicles (which we still have occasionally). Fruit is good for kids, she really needs to talk to a nutritionist.", "I fail to grasp the difference.", "Yes. I think she was shamed for being fat when she was young. Maybe she was a victim before and now becoming the predator.", "No its a trend nowdays. These moms watch too many crazy tiktokers talk about being gluten free/sugar free and its the keeping up competition and they do it. In fact at the very beginning of covid some idiot dance moms were talking about \"no I'm not worried about catching covid we are gluten and sugar free so have a clean diet\" WTAF????", "Yeah i googled it after commenting and saw that it wasn't lol", "But fruit is also good and healthy? It has a lot of fiber and tends to be the only insoluble fiber most adults eat in a day.", "I dont really remember. I grew to 5'10, pretty tall for a lady. So I must have got what I needed. There were school dinners, so I didnt always eat my mothers cooking. But even they were a little lack luster.  Probably had a bit of salt though.\n\nMy mum had a thyroid condition, I think thats something to do with iodine?", "I mean, your thyroid definitely needs iodine, so she wasn't doing herself any favors if she completely avoided iodized salt...", "NTA, when you're right you're right", "NTA. I feel for these poor kids. My mom was the same way, no junk at all, constantly policing us in what we ate. Me and my sisters all ended up with eating disorders. I refuse to let her see her granddaughter anymore because she started in on her too.", "She is going to give those kids a eating disorder", "The kids can't even have FRUIT? NTA", "NTA. What you said was absolutely true", "NTA op at all! You are setting your children up for healthy relationships with food and that's a really important and often overlooked responsibility in parenting. I will be genuinely surprised if your SIL's children don't eventually develop some manner of eating disorder because she's putting together the recipe for one.", "Nta. The way you and your family view food is very similar to how I see it: pretty much all foods are ok in moderation. Her method is only ensuring that her kids don\u2019t have any self control about what foods they eat. Plus the \u201cno fruits\u201d thing is super weird. As far as I\u2019m aware, fruit is vital to a healthy and balanced diet.", "Just out of curiosity, what kind of ed does this sound like? Not judging, I'm just curious bc it sounds a hell of a lot like my family dynamic and I want to know what to call it in therapy lol", "I don\u2019t think she did, she blamed their mother for the kids having an obsession with junk. The kids themselves weren\u2019t blamed for their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, SIL attempting to body shame children by checking their clothing labels and using the term \u201ctubbos\u201d is prime AH behaviour. \n\nOP NTA", "She clearly has an eating disorder.", "This comment alone should disqualify her from ever seeing your kids again. NTA. \n\nKudos on teaching your kids how to have a healthy normal relationship with food. Hers are probably going to end up with eating disorders.", "Awe, it's so cute when people get all judgemental about moderation", "No fruit, wtf is wrong with her?", "Maybe you're thinking of obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which is NOT the same thing as OCD.  https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/ocd-vs-ocpd-whats-the-difference", ">\tThis kind of parenting treads really goddamned close to abuse.\n\nIt ***is*** abuse. And I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that.", "I don't know that it's orthorexia, unless she has that herself.  If she's putting it on someone else, I would consider it more obessive compulsive personality disorder.", "Oh sorry, I didn't realise, I probably do mean obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I didn't realise there was a difference - sorry, but thanks for the info!", "Every kid I know whose parents were that food restrictive ended up the same way - obsessed with junk/sweets and with an unhealthily relationship to food", "Good human!", "I'm so sorry - I know how awful that feels. My mom passed years ago, from cancer (Fuck Cancer, by the way).  I'd given up on ever making her happy by then - but I very stubbornly held on to the idea that I could somehow make my dad proud of me for far longer - and that was pretty damned hurtful. I hope you're healing now.", "Thanks. I'm just glad that my daughter hasn't been damaged by it. We stopped the damage with me.", "You're probably right. \"by proxy\" disorders are controversial to begin with.", "No problem, a lot of people aren't aware there is a difference between OCD and OCPD.", "If it's anything like the US food pyramid it was wrong and never was based on a healthy diet to begin with.  They rearranged the food pyramid but it's so complicated looking now that I think the My Plate model is just easier to follow.", "Tons of bad studies with an agenda mean not a lot.", "Do you know how hard that is? I don\u2019t know you, but damn am I proud of you! You stopped generational abuse right in its tracks. Not everyone can do that.", "I hadn't heard of orthorexia by proxy at all and I looked around.  They don't even have a good working definition of orthorexia nervosa (like anorexia nervosa is the official name of anorexia) let alone ON by proxy.  There's no ON by proxy in the diagnostic manual.  I think that the mother might have the desire to control others, hence obsessive control personality disorder and in her case the obsession is around food.", "Compared to your source, which appears to be your ass? \n\nYou're spouting a whole lot of bullshit without any evidence.", "I cannot be bothered to evidence common knowledge. Feel free to look yourself, or not it you are somehow invested in the lie.", "It's obviously not common knowledge if a bunch of people are telling you that you're wrong."]}
