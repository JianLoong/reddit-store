But get this, they aren\u2019t spoiled brats. She\u2019s taught them manners, how privileged they are, etc and will absolutely discipline them if they misbehave but she has never said no to buying them a toy or anything unless it was harmful or whatever else. \n\nShe thinks that if she can afford it, there is no reason to say no (again, unless it\u2019s dangerous or inappropriate). \n\nThe boys also have a room stocked with toys. It\u2019s actually pretty cool. They have their own rooms as well but that play room goes hard. I\u2019m saying this as a 22 year old woman. \n\nMy sister\u2019s SIL isn\u2019t a huge fan of this. She thinks that my sister is spoiling them and that even if it isn\u2019t showing now, it\u2019s bound to make them misbehave in some way soon enough. My sister tells her SIL to mind her own.\n\nI\u2019m on my sister\u2019s side simply because I know her. She\u2019s a wonderful mother and teacher. Her SIL\u2019s just jealous because of how close my sister is to her kids because one thing about those boys-they love their mommy! \n\nHer SIL\u2019s relationship with her kids is complicated. \n\nAnyways, my sister hosted a girls night with me, our sisters and her SILs. Her husband was out and her kids were in bed. We were having a good time when that SIL left to use the washroom. All of a sudden, we heard a loud crash coming from the play room.\n\nMy sister almost had a heart attack thinking one of her boys snuck into the room and got hurt. Nope, it was just her SIL.\n\nShe was basically trying to take some of the toys and had put a couple in her bag. My sister was just shocked and asked if she was being serious. Her SIL just shrugged and said they have too many toys and \u201cthe toys will probably  be better off with less privileged kids\u201d.\n\nMy sister told her to get the fuck out but she kept arguing saying that she\u2019s raising spoilt and entitled boys and that she\u2019s scared for the future generation.\n\nMy sister was about to lose it so I cut in and said that she should be concerned for her own kids considering her eldest just got expelled for bullying. \n\nIt went quiet and she started crying. She called me a bitch and said she was only trying to help and I had no right to bring up her daughter. She insisted that her daughter getting expelled has nothing to do with the situation and I was just trying to insult her. She did leave though. The rest of us helped clean up but one of SIL\u2019s sisters said that I shouldn\u2019t have brought up her kids. I called her to talk but she hasn\u2019t answered.

Good for you for standing up for your sister. And wtf SIL trying to steal her nephews toys.   Insane.     She would not have left  if you had not thrown that out there about her daughter.   It  Seems like she needed a reality check and you gave her one. SIL is jealous of your sister and her great relationship with her sons and good parenting.  Good for you.", "NTA. Her daughter being a bully is probably directly connected to her being a bully, like in this case towards your sister.", "Lol, kid got expelled for bullying? Wonder where they get it from. NTA - shut that stupid shit down by any means necessary. It\u2019s a valid point to make in that instant", "SIL is a narcissist and a thief.  NTA", "NTA, someone had to bring her down a peg or two...\n\nBesides her daughter probably learned the bullying from her sadly.", "I can\u2019t get over these people. You shouldn\u2019t have brought up how she raises her kids in a conversation she started about how other people are raising their kids? That family sucks so bad", "NTA. \n\nA bit of a low blow, but in this context, I think it is in-bounds.", "NTA, she\u2019s literally committing theft.", "NTA. What you said is called a reality check. Spoiling kids can be as much about teaching kids no responsibility/manners/accountability/gratitude as it can be about having too many material things. Sounds like your sisters kids have been taught the fundamentals of good behaviour. Sounds like no-one has taught those things to SiL.", "NTA. She was acting entirely out of line, essentially stealing from someone else\u2019s children and was planning on giving it to her own kids (assuming also the suspended child) which is rewarding bad behaviour. \n\nShe wanted to control how your sister parents her children but was insulted when you brought up her own parenting (or lack thereof). She can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nAs a side note\u2026 was she just expecting to fill her purse and walk out without your sister realizing toys were missing? What kind of Grinch nonsense is that?", "NTA she is making her situation in life about her sisters.  She was stealing from kids as an adult which is deplorable no matter her circumstances.", "NTA. She should be THANKING all of you for not calling the cops on her! \nInfo: When you say she was crying, did you see real tears? Many narcissistic people become experts at fake crying to gain sympathy.", "NTA-Your sister is a literal thief!", "I can't believe I'm saying this, but NTA. I can not imagine in what universe a grown woman would think it's OK to steal toys from someone else's children because she thinks she knows what's best.", "NTA. SIL is obviously projecting", "NTA. So SIL can make comments and judgements about the other kids but you are not allowed to do the same thing? No, she's jealous and stealing toys is a clear sign of it. However, your sister is playing a dangerous game buying her kids whatever they want. They are not learning how to accept being told NO and how to handle disappointment. I've seen great people/parents raise kids who come out shitty because of this very thing.", "NTA. In a utopia, your dig was perhaps a low blow. But in reality, you get 'em, girl. SIL sounds a bit nuts and shouldn't throw stones if she lives in a glass house.", "NTA, SIL is a bully herself.", "NTA. This person does not want to focus on raising her kids.\n\nThat's why she projected and said that you have no right to bring up her daughter. Hell, you certainly have more of a right than her, because it seems she has no interest in it.\n\nShe is at a girl's night, trying to steal toys, when her OLDEST (meaning she has had the most time to raise, help and learn) child just got expelled for *bullying*? She should be at home trying to work her own shit out.", "NTA\n\nAnother situation where the context changes things. SIL was stealing from her nephews, and justifying it as them being spoiled.  Whether they actually are spoiled or not, that\u2019s still theft.  Normally, I\u2019d say you shouldn\u2019t get involved and let your sister manage her relationship with her SIL. Normally, I\u2019d also say don\u2019t criticize others kids when you\u2019re made at the parents. But, your sister\u2019s SIL is the one that opened that door. She\u2019s the one who F\u2019ed around and Found Out.  \n\nThe more important question here should only be what your sister and her husband think.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
