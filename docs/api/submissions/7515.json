So SIL can make comments and judgements about the other kids but you are not allowed to do the same thing? No, she's jealous and stealing toys is a clear sign of it. However, your sister is playing a dangerous game buying her kids whatever they want. They are not learning how to accept being told NO and how to handle disappointment. I've seen great people/parents raise kids who come out shitty because of this very thing.", "NTA. In a utopia, your dig was perhaps a low blow. But in reality, you get 'em, girl. SIL sounds a bit nuts and shouldn't throw stones if she lives in a glass house.", "NTA, SIL is a bully herself.", "NTA. This person does not want to focus on raising her kids.\n\nThat's why she projected and said that you have no right to bring up her daughter. Hell, you certainly have more of a right than her, because it seems she has no interest in it.\n\nShe is at a girl's night, trying to steal toys, when her OLDEST (meaning she has had the most time to raise, help and learn) child just got expelled for *bullying*?
