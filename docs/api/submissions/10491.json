The test is 99.9% accurate.\n\nIf you are pregnant and not married, most states have laws that require   \nan Acknowledgment of Paternity (AOP) form to be completed at the   \nhospital immediately after birth to legally establish who the father is.  \n After the AOP is signed, couples have a limited amount of time,   \ndepending on the state, to request DNA paternity test and amend the AOP.  \n This form is filed with the Bureau of Vital Statistics and is a legally  \n binding document.", "YTA.
