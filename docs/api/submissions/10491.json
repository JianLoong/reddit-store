Absent that, it seems to me that it's as potentially relevant as any other conduct between an unmarried couple to that inquiry, and not obviously barred by any particular legal principle.

If a state does do that, I'd be interested in hearing about it.\n\nWhile it's true that liability for child support doesn't begin until birth, the establishment of the parental relationship can, as far as I've ever been able to tell or ever understood it, predate birth. Again, I'd be very interested in cases that take the view that only post-birth conduct can establish a parental relationship."]}
