The issue is that we'd much rather use that money to go on a date night ourselves, not go out to dinner with my parents, at a restaurant of their choosing.

We go out to dinner about once a month and it normally costs each couple \\~$250, which is the average cost of a meal for two (with drinks) in our area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I do fine for ourselves, but are nowhere even close to as wealthy as my parents. We do not have substantive savings to speak of outside of a modest emergency fund and our 401ks. We recently bought a home that we're renovating, so our cash has been tighter than usual. We're also trying to prioritize saving because we're looking to have a baby soon. My parents are aware of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of splitting the bill with my parents given how much wealthier they are than my husband and me. WIBTA if I stopped splitting the bill with them?

I don't know what level of restaurant you are used to that $250/couple is \"normal,\" but I suggest telling your parents you want to start going to less expensive places.

If you go, eat and drink, and then refuse to pay, YTA. If you decline the invite, you're not.

Whenever me (38F) and my husband (40M) do anything with them, they always split the bill 50/50, unless it's my birthday, in which case they pick up the bill, but grumble about it, half joking. We go out to dinner about once a month and it normally costs each couple \\~$250, which is the average cost of a meal for two (with drinks) in our area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I do fine for ourselves, but are nowhere even close to as wealthy as my parents. We do not have substantive savings to speak of outside of a modest emergency fund and our 401ks. We recently bought a home that we're renovating, so our cash has been tighter than usual. We're also trying to prioritize saving because we're looking to have a baby soon. My parents are aware of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of splitting the bill with my parents given how much wealthier they are than my husband and me. WIBTA if I stopped splitting the bill with them? They do not support us in any capacity, nor have they ever. I paid my own way through college and have never asked for money.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If that's the plan, then YWBTA. \n\nYou're being incredibly passive about the whole situation. They choose the restaurant. They order the food. They impose the 50/50 split. It's time to be more vocal about your needs here. \n\nAs others have suggested, the much better approach would simply be to tell them that paying for these meals doesn't fit in your budget right now. You can offer alternatives - less expensive restaurants, separate checks, etc. - and then see how they want to handle it. But you need to be clear that the status quo isn't going to work for you.", "YTA if you simply refuse to pay your half of the check.
