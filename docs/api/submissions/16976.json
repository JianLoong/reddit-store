The issue is that we'd much rather use that money to go on a date night ourselves, not go out to dinner with my parents, at a restaurant of their choosing.

We go out to dinner about once a month and it normally costs each couple \\~$250, which is the average cost of a meal for two (with drinks) in our area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I do fine for ourselves, but are nowhere even close to as wealthy as my parents. We do not have substantive savings to speak of outside of a modest emergency fund and our 401ks. We recently bought a home that we're renovating, so our cash has been tighter than usual. We're also trying to prioritize saving because we're looking to have a baby soon. My parents are aware of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of splitting the bill with my parents given how much wealthier they are than my husband and me. WIBTA if I stopped splitting the bill with them?

They can (1) pick a restaurant that is within your budget (surely there are some that they would like), (2) they can offer to treat you because they'd still like to enjoy your company and dinner at their preferred restaurant, or (3) catch you another time (and seeing them a little less frequently might make it easier for you to pay your way with them).\n2.
