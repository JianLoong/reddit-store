The issue is that we'd much rather use that money to go on a date night ourselves, not go out to dinner with my parents, at a restaurant of their choosing.

We go out to dinner about once a month and it normally costs each couple \\~$250, which is the average cost of a meal for two (with drinks) in our area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I do fine for ourselves, but are nowhere even close to as wealthy as my parents. We do not have substantive savings to speak of outside of a modest emergency fund and our 401ks. We recently bought a home that we're renovating, so our cash has been tighter than usual. We're also trying to prioritize saving because we're looking to have a baby soon. My parents are aware of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of splitting the bill with my parents given how much wealthier they are than my husband and me. WIBTA if I stopped splitting the bill with them?

Lol he knew how much more he made.", "I wouldn\u2019t think so coz they grumble about paying for her once a year birthday dinner.", "Then your response makes more sense.  :)", "This! I don't get way OP thinks the solution is to demand that they pay because well forst of all you can't! She literally cannot make them pay. Also, there are so many other options available. You insist that you split the bill. They don't want that? Too bad. You are an adult and yiu get to decide for yourself so you don't ask for rheir permission. You just ask the waiter for a separate bill. You want to go to cheaper places? You find a restaurant and you invite them. You don't really want to see them for dinner that often? You tell them that you are busk and will see them next month.", "Yeah I suppose.\n\nBut I also can't imagine having 25 million dollars and not paying for every event I did with my kids. I'd be paying for vacations, concerts, meals, everything...\n\nWhat the hell is the point of being rich if you can't treat your kids lol.", "Actually they did try something different. They tried to contain the spending by ordering less, and when they asked for separate bills the parents insulted their attitude, calling it \"cheap\".", "Agreed! I was confused by the post at first, but now pretty sure that OP's edits are just excuses as to why she's not considering any of the obvious solutions. Sounds like she really just wants a free expensive dinner.", " I also don't see where there's a discrepancy between what the parents and OP ordered of $250 to $50. It says $250 is the average for a meal with drinks in their area. That alone seems absurd to me if it's US dollars.", "I get the frustration as OP is being used to subsidise their meal choices but options. Refusing to attend sends bigger message than causing fuss in restaurant and leaves wait staff out of it.", "We are nowhere near wealthy and have already talked about how we will never make our kids pay for dinners out with us. My oldest is 21 and one more year left of school. She will most likely be making what my husband and I earn together in her first job...and there is no way we would ever make her buy us dinner. \n\nIf I had a net worth of that much I'd be doing all the things for my kids.", "The post definitely embodies rich folks problems all around and I am eating it up lol", "The parents are being obnoxious but OP is an adult that can order what they please so the issue at hand here is not money based like they are claiming.", "You can ask for a split check without causes a fuss. Or at least I would find that easy where I live (not US though). But I do agree that OP should consider just refusing to attend.", "It sounds like they tried to order cheaper items but the parents don\u2019t let them pay for just their meals. They make them pay the full cost 50/50. Even if they order much cheaper items it is still expensive because the OPs are paying a portion of the parents courses."]}
