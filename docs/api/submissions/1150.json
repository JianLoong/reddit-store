This is my first post on here and I\u2019m doing this from a phone.)\n\n\nI (28F) have struggled with insomnia since having my baby less than a year ago. My husband (30M) falls asleep the moment his head touches the pillow. \n\nI have been very strict about my sleep hygiene for over 6 months. I exercise every day, never drink caffeine, don\u2019t watch tv an hour before bed, follow a bedtime routine, go to bed the same time every single night, never spend time in my bedroom or bed when I\u2019m not sleeping, use blackout curtains, and sleep at a cool temperature. This alone has not been enough, so I\u2019m also taking a combo of unisom and melatonin (either by itself did not work). My husband\u2019s loud breathing and the neighbor\u2019s dog have both woken me up numerous times in the night and I can\u2019t fall back asleep, so now I also sleep with earplugs. However they make my ears sore, so if I am woken up in the middle of the night, I cannot fall back asleep without taking them out because they hurt. (I also used to listen to a guided sleep meditation before I used earplugs). My husband doesn\u2019t need to follow one single thing in the list mentioned above and can still fall asleep in seconds.\n\nMy recent struggle is that my husband has been staying up working until 3-4 in the morning. (He is self-employed so on days he does this, he\u2019ll sleep in until 9 or 10 in the morning.) If the bed is jostled at 4 in the morning, I\u2019m woken up and can\u2019t fall back asleep. I take care of our baby almost completely exclusively (he usually comes home 10 minutes before bedtime or after the baby is asleep), and taking care of a baby by myself on 5 hours of sleep or less sucks. I told him that I need him to sleep in the other room if he\u2019s going to sleep after 1:30 am (2-5 am are the most common hours where people are woken up and can\u2019t fall back to sleep), or that we need to get a better guest room mattress and I sleep in the guest room permanently. (We can afford a new mattress.) I\u2019m also totally okay with getting a better mattress for our guest room in general, even if I\u2019m not sleeping there permanently (there\u2019s a side that sinks so low that it feels like it\u2019s swallowing you and kills your back in the process). \n\nHe\u2019s mad that I\u2019m trying to set boundaries around my sleep and that he can\u2019t just go to bed whenever he wants like he used to before the baby. He also feels like sleeping in separate rooms is going to ruin our marriage. I just feel like it\u2019s not fair to be mad that I\u2019m trying to set boundaries to improve a serious medical issue that I have limited control over. I\u2019m doing absolutely everything in my power to sleep and it\u2019s still a struggle. \n\nAITA for asking him to sleep in the other room if it\u2019s super late or just let me get a comfortable mattress and sleep there permanently if not?", "created_utc": 1667561255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylwg2s/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_go_to_bed_at_a/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lack of sleep is horrendous for your body, especially after something traumatic like a birth.

I definitely don't have the self discipline to do what you described. \n\nThis is something you see on this sub all the time, (usually) men not understanding that things change when you have a baby. Your man had nine months to prepare himself for this.

You would also need separate duvet, but this would be the perfect middle where you are on different beds but still sleep together.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he doesn't understand how much work it is to care for a baby and how you absolutely need to sleep. It's unfortunate that you're having trouble sleeping and it sounds like you've tried pretty much everything to improve your situation. \n\nTruth be told: It's not going to last forever. Baby will grow up and sleep longer. Hopefully insomnia will be better eventually. So sleeping in separate rooms probably won't be forever. \n\nYour husband should care for your health and wellbeing and suck it up. He shouldn't feel like it's none of his problems if he wakes you in the middle of the night. \n\nI think it's pretty weird that he prefers to sleep in long and come back home late when everyone is asleep instead of getting up early and coming home earlier so he might spend a little time with his family and wife and then go to bed together.

(It kind of sounds like he's actively avoiding his family.)", "Post-partum depression can affect both parents, has he been to his doctor lately? \n\nNTA, you need sleep as much as he does and his comment about \"ruining the marriage\" deserves a deeper look tbh. Why doesn't he spend more time at home?

Then starting later, and not returning until 10 mins before baby\u2019s bedtime? \n\nSeems to me like he\u2019s wholly avoiding all responsibility at home, disrupting your sleep and then blaming you for it all; all whilst making you the sole caretaker for your shared child and home. This is your real issue: resolve this and sleep will follow as you\u2019ll both be in a better routine.", "NTA. Oof. Sleep incompatibility is AWFUL. It sounds like you\u2019ve been reasonable in your requests- is there any other way to compromise? Like 3 out of 7 nights, he can come to bed when he likes, and you\u2019ll sleep in the spare room that night?\n\nOff topic but worth mentioning: My best tip for couples is having separate bedding (doona/blankets/sheets) because when you\u2019re tired and maybe cranky and your partner steals the GODDAMN COVERS FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME, you\u2019re going to feel hostile. Separate covers - no problem!!!", "NTA. A lot of married people have separate rooms. As long as you have visitation, it's fine. It's important to get enough sleep. \n\nOn a side note: have you tried silicone putty earplugs? They're pretty comfortable, and really help my insomnia.", "YtA. \n\nYour solutions will break up your marriage. It sucks that you haven't found something that works for you. I tried no noise, it just made me overly sensitive to all small unexpected noises that would pop up. So now I use a TV show I've watched a thousand times to put me to bed. It's the best method for me and my partner.\n\nFind something that works for you both.  Let him watch his baby while you sleep, caress till you fall asleep. But having different rooms is usually a death sentence on a marriage. Your solution right not will likely only make you happy. Find a better compromise Mayne. Good luck.", "NTA. His opinion that sleeping in seperate rooms ruins marriages is complete and utter garbage. 20 years successfully relationship here and seperate rooms. I have PTSD and am not safe to sleep with.

He wants to sleep with his wife who it seems like he never gets to see because of long work hours. That\u2019s reasonable. You wanting sleep is also reasonable. Maybe you could do the guest room ideas some nights and other nights you guys try to sleep together? Or find some other time to hang out other than in bed? Or maybe go to a sleep psychologist?

If one or both partners have sleeping issues, sleeping apart will go a long way to save a marriage.
