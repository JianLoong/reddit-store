{"id": 23382, "submission_id": "15cir2e", "title": "AITA for refusing to forgive a debt that will cost my sister a house?", "selftext": "My mother died about 2 months ago. She didn\u2019t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K) and a little money in the bank. Mom announced a couple of years ago that she intended to leave her house to my sister Sara who takes care of her severely disabled son full-time.  Mom said that she wanted to make sure they had a roof over their heads and the rest of her kids could make it on their own.  Sara does struggle a lot and has said many times that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it without Mom. \n\nWhen Mom died she had some bills outstanding, but her biggest debt was that she owed me $37K. I had loaned her the money so that she could fix her plumbing and septic system, as well as making the house more handicapped friendly for Sara and Jeremy. Mom had been paying me back every month. I have paperwork proving the money is owed. \n\nHere is the problem. If I file a claim against her estate like any other creditor would do, my brother John (Mom\u2019s executor) will have no choice but to pay it. But to do so \u2013 he will have to sell the house since there isn\u2019t money in the estate to pay it any other way. Which means that Sara and Jeremy will have to find a different place to live.  I know Mom wanted Sara to have the house. There is also the issue that Mom\u2019s will said Sara got the house, but any money in the estate would be split evenly between the other 4 of us. So technically we think that means Sara wouldn\u2019t actually get anything (John is talking to a lawyer to make sure he is reading that right). Sara is also concerned that if she did get a large amount of money (John and I have both said we would give her whatever we got from the house if it does get sold) \u2013 that it could interfere with the help she gets from the government. \n\nJohn and Sara are both pushing me to not file a claim against the estate. But if I don\u2019t \u2013 then the loan basically goes away. Sara has said that she will pay it back to me and would even sign a new loan. The trouble is that I don\u2019t believe her. She has borrowed money before and never paid it back \u2013 not because she doesn\u2019t want to, but because she can\u2019t afford to. She struggled with money living with Mom \u2013 so it is going to be even worse for her without Mom paying bills in the house as well. If I don\u2019t file a claim \u2013 I will be out $37K \u2013 and that is far more than I want to hand over as a gift \u2013 even to my sister. \n\nI\u2019ve told John and Sara that I am officially filing a claim on Monday morning. They are both calling me a greedy asshole and telling me that I am ignoring what Mom wanted. I think it's unreasonable to expect me to just forget $37K.

If she gifted the house outright in the will, (here in Canada) that would be a specific property bequest and not part of the \u201cresidual\u201d estate that\u2019s divided up.  But this will vary depending on your estate laws and how the will was written\u2026. So here in Canada you filing a claim would not automatically make your sister lose the house, because of our hierarchy of payments, debts are paid from residue first, and the real estate transaction last.  Are there enough other assets to cover the loan? It might mean no one else gets a portion. \n\nAnd for anyone else reading this - if you\u2019re loaning money to elder relatives - buy a life insurance policy for the amount loaned (and add the premiums to the loan amount) to save yourself from this issue.  \nSituation sucks - NTA.", ">She has borrowed money before and never paid it back\n\nThis, right here, is why my policy on loaning money to family is \"Don't loan any amount of money to family that I wouldn't be willing to shred, burn, bury, then dig up and bury again.\"\n\nYou're NTA to file a claim against the estate. Your mom owed you that money, and as she was paying you back monthly, it's clearly \"what Mom wanted.\" Now it's up to her estate to pay it. Just be prepared for your remaining family members to become alienated from you when you file the claim.", "NTA for wanting your money, but couldn't you be creative about it?\n\nYou've loaned Sara money and never got it back, but it was an informal loan.\n\nWhat if you file a claim, accept a loan from Sara to clear it, and with a lien against the house as collateral. Would something like that do?", "INFO: 37K is no small sum, but how are you/family/spouse doing financially? If Sara loses the house, will she become houseless with a disabled son?", "INFO... Can you put a lien against the house instead?", "Info. Why can\u2019t she take out a loan against the house ? Why would you or John get anything from the sale ? Why can\u2019t you figure out a payment plan with your sister that doesn\u2019t leave her and your nephew homeless?", "Hmm. I think I might actually have to go with NAH. Legally, you have a right to a claim against the estate, and there's no way to ensure repayment legally without selling the house. \n\nOn the other hand, that would be you getting your $37K back, and Sara possibly ending up with nothing. If she has that much cash from the sale, it might not be enough to buy anything else but it could be enough to disqualify her from assistance she certainly needs with a disabled child (this depends on a lot of state specific factors so I can't answer it definitively). \n\nYou have two options. One is to file a claim against the estate, and then have to live with the consequences od what happens to your sister and Jeremy. And depending on what those are, you could be the asshole for that, even if you're legally in the clear, especially since you'd be disregarding your mother's very clearly expressed wishes. You'd also risk permanently alienating your family. Ask yourself if that's worth $37K (and I am well aware it's not chump change) \n\nThe other is to let go a claim against the estate but get your siblings including Sara to sign some kind of contract to repay you. This shouldn't all be on you. \n\nIf Sara is a full time caregiver she may not be able to get a HELOC to repay you.", "I gather that you have three siblings besides Sara. If they feel that you should be willing to make sacrifices to help Sara, then why don't they split the burden with you? If each of your three other siblings repaid you $9,250, and you forgave the remaining $9,250 of the debt, then you would all have contributed equally to Sara's support. \n\nIf they aren't willing to do that, then they are not morally justified in criticizing you for being unwilling to let the $37k go.", "YTA for a few reasons here. \n1. You refuse to wait for your brother/the executor to talk to an attorney, which is literally happening later in the week. \n2. Several people have made outstanding points, like getting a new contract or a lien against the house, you absolutely will not hear out a single word of it, just repeatedly saying she will not pay and I\u2019ll never see the money. That\u2019s where contracts and liens come in, they are literally there to protect you. \n3. You state you are QUITE financially stable right now and that you do not need this money right this second, but you\u2019re also unwilling to help find any workarounds for your sister and her MULTIPLE children, you\u2019re happy to make her homeless. \n4. You CLAIM that you and John are willing to give her your shares but are unsure if the other siblings will. But that it could also screw with the benefits she HAS TO HAVE to take care of her child so you all are willing to essentially hold onto it and what, give her as you see fit? And the other two siblings - who realistically shouldn\u2019t be getting a dime but will if you do this - have said nothing about THEIR shares. \n5. You are willing to make your sister and her children homeless over money that you are not in dire need of right this minute. \n\nNo one in their right mind is telling you you should walk away from 37k and just be fine with that. But they are telling you to take a step back and find out all the information before jumping and you have zero interest in doing that, OR accepting the judgement you requested when it\u2019s not going your way.", "INFO, how much would your share be if you sold the house, given the current local market? If your share would be more than $37k, and you\u2019ve already said you\u2019d be giving your share to your sister, then what\u2019s the difference between giving her the $37k through selling the house or forgiving the $37k debt against your mom\u2019s estate?", "Yta.  Give them time.  Let her take over the loan.  If you don't you really are violating your mother's wishes and evicting them at a terrible time.  Try to stay calm.  Let them know if they lapse payment for more than 3 months you will put a line on the house.  Anything other than that is cruelty.", "I can\u2019t get past the irony that the original loan was, in part, to adapt the house for your nephew and that now those same adaptations have put his ability to live there at risk.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't just want to sell the house to get it away from Sara, you also want to ensure she can be cut from any monies from the house since the will indicates the house goes to her and any money from the estate goes to the 4 of us. In addition, your mom's intent was never for you to get the house money. \n\nIf you want to make this as your mother intended and protect Sara then the estate pays you the 37,000 out of the sale of the house but NONE of the rest of the money is split between anyone. It all goes to Sara in a trust so her and her son's benefits are safe and they can buy a home.", "Is your sister worth more or less than 37k to you?

Sounds like a hill you want to die on.  Your sister is guiltless in this.  You loaned money to your mother.  You knew she was older.  You did not take precautions to get paid back IE Life insurance.

Figure out exactly what was outlined in the will; who gets what money, etc. If the will was written by a lawyer, I doubt it was left intentionally vague.\n\nI'm just speculating but maybe there's a way to take out a Heloc on the house... you get your $37k and your sister and husband have to pay back the Heloc.

The estate will be legally required to pay you back. \n\n3. Ask your siblings to make you executor of the estate and to relinquish all claims of owner ship to the house. \n\n4. Enter into a legal repayment plan with the estate to provide you monthly payments to pay off the debt. I would add a clause stating that if the estate failed to make a payment they would be required to make the payment in full in x days. \n\n5. Rent the house to your sister for an amount that is comfortable for her to pay using her government assistance. \n\n6. If your sister fails to make a payment then you as the executor would have the obligation to sell the house to pay off the debt. \n\nOption 2. \n\n1 follow all of the steps above \n\n2. If your sister is unable to make payments on her own, rent out rooms in the house to cover the monthly payment. \n\nOptions 3.\n\nThe estate can take out a loan against the house to pay back the debt.

To say you're being greedy (as I've seen several commentators claim) for not gifting the money is flat out insulting.

That should settle your debt. Imagine if that happened and you HAD forgiven the debt.

Then you could be the generous sibling by letting your sister stay in the house while keeping an investment instead of losing your money and essentially giving it to your sister.\n\nObviously, a lawyer should get involved, but I think equity in the house is the only reasonable solution to this dilemma. It allows you to maintain some of your investment while allowing your sister a place to live.

That agreement clearly hinges on a number of factors, premised on *assumptions* on the part of both OP, and OPs mother. \n\nEg; that OP was loaning the money for a specific purpose that met whatever criteria OP needed met (ie improvements to the family home vs personal debt held by mom, and more specifically plumbing overhaul vs luxury interior redesign or unnecessary landscaping of the yard.) \n\nThat the loan was agreed to by, for, and between mom and OP exclusively, Without a clause included to cover any \u201cin the event that XYZ\u201d scenarios in which mom might be incapacitated or unable to make the payments. \n\nWhat were the terms for mom in the event *she* could not make the monthly payment, whether temporarily or long-term. If there were none, and it was a smile and a handshake kind of informal arrangement, then why does that change when it\u2019s no longer mom making the payments? If there was a clause, is the clause heritable along with the debt? \n\nWould mom have ever made the decision/agreement had she known the consequences (specifically the voiding of her primary, clearly expressed, and fully understood by everyone intention that the home would be passed on to Sara)? Would mom have, contingent on OPs rigid and unblushing  \u201cletter of the law\u201d vs *spirit* of the law, ever agreed to the loan in the first place, or might she have explored other options in order to ensure that her dying wishes were preserved? \n\nMom is now deceased. So no one can ask her. And OP appears to be using that fact, along with seemingly arbitrary exceptions and exclusions that were invented *only after mom had passed away*, to strongarm both her sister\u2014 the intended recipient of the house\u2014 and her brother- the executor of their mother\u2019s estate\u2014 in to doing something that directly violates their mother\u2019s wishes. For no evident reason beyond \u201cI can\u201d, and a presumption of not being repaid bc of her own prior loaning of money to her sister\u2026 despite refusing to explore other options, and being resolute in her unwillingness to work together towards a solution that is not preemptive and punitive, and that could very well serve *everyone*, herself included. \n\nMom\u2019s only been gone for 2 months, and I know grief does weird things to people in unique and unexpected ways, so I have to wonder what is *really* driving OPs hard-nosed, take no prisoners, don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists attitude towards her own sister and her profoundly disabled child, who mom was so clear in intending to protect. OP may be struggling with jealousy, or long ago grudges, or unaddressed resentments, or just missing her mom and feeling angry but putting that anger on someone who doesn\u2019t deserve it. But she is making a permanent decision with massive implications that might bring her fast cash she doesn\u2019t seem to actually need, at the expense of something that simply cannot be replaced: the trust, confidence, and safety of her remaining family. \n\nI reallllly hope she\u2019ll take a big step back, let everyone\u2019s big feelings (her own, most of all) come back down to earth, wait for some perspective and maybe even some legal advice, and make that very serious decision from a saner, more informed, and less reactionary place.

The money they loaned their mom was life insurance from their husband passing away (last year, I think).\n\nMom was wanting to fix up the house to make it more accessible to for the nephew. Instead of getting a loan and having to pay interest, OP decided to help mom out with an interest free loan between the two of them. OP didn't know what to do with the money anyway, given their emotional state, so the money was just sitting there anyway.\n\nMom made regular monthly payments on the loan. $37k is the remaining loan balance. Mom always intended to pay OP back. The money was never a gift, and it's money OP is entitled to have. Mom never intended OP to be out of that money but unfortunately passed away before paying it back.\n\nThe question is, is OP an AH for putting a claim against the estate to get their money back when their mom wanted the house to go to the sister and grandchild and paying back OP would mean selling the house?\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the only reason OP gave their mom the money was to save her on interest. If OP hadn't given the money (and if OP's husband hadn't passed away), mom would have taken out a loan and a claim would STILL need to be made against the estate for the money mom owed. So there would still be the question of how to help the sister keep the house as mom wanted.\n\nOP has gone to the siblings and offered to split the remaining $37k balance (which would have been more if mom had taken out a traditional loan) between them, and they have refused. They expect OP to simply lose the money they gained from their husband's life insurance.\n\nThe situation sucks, but it's not OP's responsibility to pay off their mother's debts.\n\nNTA \n\nI would suggest, as others have put forward, that some discussion with a lawyer happen so sister doesn't lose her benefits with the inheritance she receives from the estate.", "I think you might feel better if you reframe the situation as many of us here see it. When you \"lend\" money to a family member, even if there's an agreement to repay it, there is always some part of it that's personal and a gift, otherwise you'd just borrow money from a bank. I.e. in some sense it's a gift where you might get some of the money back but you shouldn't treat it like a bank loan where you have a right to repossess it, no matter what the cost is to the borrower. Ask yourself why you lent your mother the money - did you want to help her, make her happy, show that you're the \"successful one\", etc.? Why didn't you tell her to borrow it from the bank if there wasn't a personal component to it? And what would you gain if you forced them to default - would that make you feel righteous or successful, or just shitty?

Liquidating the home does not convert that asset into a shared pot.\n\nFurther, the executor doesn\u2019t get to decide which assets to pick from to convert and pay the debt without court permission. \n\nThe court doesn\u2019t care who owns the 37k debt the OP is filing for - doesn\u2019t care they are also a beneficiary of a smaller liquid portion of the estate. The court will first turn to the easiest assets to recover from the estate - which is not the home. The court also doesn\u2019t care the sister benefitted from the loan to Grandma. It is the estate\u2019s debt, not the sister\u2019s debt. \n\nThe sister is a tenant of the home, along with a vulnerable minor. \n\nA court would have to order an eviction. That costs money. It also ignores the decedent\u2019s wishes - which is the probate courts first duty, in addition to the executor\u2019s first duty. \n\nAll of this is ignoring the fact that it seems like the will specifically names the sister as sole house asset beneficiary - which is a gift of an item of real property to a certain beneficiary. If the will or trust has that specific beneficiary information in there, in some jurisdictions the executor is obligated to distribute that item out completely to the beneficiary. Heck, it may even bypass probate altogether. Another point - the beneficiary has to give permission to sell the property in some jurisdictions.\n\nExecutor still has to operate under the probate court\u2019s approval. \n\nFrankly, I hope the OP files - they will end up with less money than if they had worked with the sister on a mortgage - and it\u2019s more likely the siblings won\u2019t see one red penny.\n\nI mean, if I was a betting woman -\n I\u2019d be placing a big old bet on what I outlined, and pulling out the popcorn.", "And money often turns people into assholes, even when they don\u2019t need it.
