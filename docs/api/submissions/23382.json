{"id": 23382, "submission_id": "15cir2e", "title": "AITA for refusing to forgive a debt that will cost my sister a house?", "selftext": "My mother died about 2 months ago. She didn\u2019t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K) and a little money in the bank. Mom announced a couple of years ago that she intended to leave her house to my sister Sara who takes care of her severely disabled son full-time.  Mom said that she wanted to make sure they had a roof over their heads and the rest of her kids could make it on their own.  Sara does struggle a lot and has said many times that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it without Mom. \n\nWhen Mom died she had some bills outstanding, but her biggest debt was that she owed me $37K. I had loaned her the money so that she could fix her plumbing and septic system, as well as making the house more handicapped friendly for Sara and Jeremy. Mom had been paying me back every month. I have paperwork proving the money is owed. \n\nHere is the problem. If I file a claim against her estate like any other creditor would do, my brother John (Mom\u2019s executor) will have no choice but to pay it. But to do so \u2013 he will have to sell the house since there isn\u2019t money in the estate to pay it any other way. Which means that Sara and Jeremy will have to find a different place to live.  I know Mom wanted Sara to have the house. There is also the issue that Mom\u2019s will said Sara got the house, but any money in the estate would be split evenly between the other 4 of us. So technically we think that means Sara wouldn\u2019t actually get anything (John is talking to a lawyer to make sure he is reading that right). Sara is also concerned that if she did get a large amount of money (John and I have both said we would give her whatever we got from the house if it does get sold) \u2013 that it could interfere with the help she gets from the government. \n\nJohn and Sara are both pushing me to not file a claim against the estate. But if I don\u2019t \u2013 then the loan basically goes away. Sara has said that she will pay it back to me and would even sign a new loan. The trouble is that I don\u2019t believe her. She has borrowed money before and never paid it back \u2013 not because she doesn\u2019t want to, but because she can\u2019t afford to. She struggled with money living with Mom \u2013 so it is going to be even worse for her without Mom paying bills in the house as well. If I don\u2019t file a claim \u2013 I will be out $37K \u2013 and that is far more than I want to hand over as a gift \u2013 even to my sister. \n\nI\u2019ve told John and Sara that I am officially filing a claim on Monday morning. They are both calling me a greedy asshole and telling me that I am ignoring what Mom wanted. I think it's unreasonable to expect me to just forget $37K.

If she gifted the house outright in the will, (here in Canada) that would be a specific property bequest and not part of the \u201cresidual\u201d estate that\u2019s divided up.  But this will vary depending on your estate laws and how the will was written\u2026. So here in Canada you filing a claim would not automatically make your sister lose the house, because of our hierarchy of payments, debts are paid from residue first, and the real estate transaction last.  Are there enough other assets to cover the loan? It might mean no one else gets a portion. \n\nAnd for anyone else reading this - if you\u2019re loaning money to elder relatives - buy a life insurance policy for the amount loaned (and add the premiums to the loan amount) to save yourself from this issue.  \nSituation sucks - NTA.", ">She has borrowed money before and never paid it back\n\nThis, right here, is why my policy on loaning money to family is \"Don't loan any amount of money to family that I wouldn't be willing to shred, burn, bury, then dig up and bury again.\"\n\nYou're NTA to file a claim against the estate. Your mom owed you that money, and as she was paying you back monthly, it's clearly \"what Mom wanted.\" Now it's up to her estate to pay it. Just be prepared for your remaining family members to become alienated from you when you file the claim.", "NTA for wanting your money, but couldn't you be creative about it?\n\nYou've loaned Sara money and never got it back, but it was an informal loan.\n\nWhat if you file a claim, accept a loan from Sara to clear it, and with a lien against the house as collateral. Would something like that do?", "INFO: 37K is no small sum, but how are you/family/spouse doing financially? If Sara loses the house, will she become houseless with a disabled son?", "INFO... Can you put a lien against the house instead?", "Info. Why can\u2019t she take out a loan against the house ? Why would you or John get anything from the sale ? Why can\u2019t you figure out a payment plan with your sister that doesn\u2019t leave her and your nephew homeless?", "Hmm. I think I might actually have to go with NAH. Legally, you have a right to a claim against the estate, and there's no way to ensure repayment legally without selling the house. \n\nOn the other hand, that would be you getting your $37K back, and Sara possibly ending up with nothing. If she has that much cash from the sale, it might not be enough to buy anything else but it could be enough to disqualify her from assistance she certainly needs with a disabled child (this depends on a lot of state specific factors so I can't answer it definitively). \n\nYou have two options. One is to file a claim against the estate, and then have to live with the consequences od what happens to your sister and Jeremy. And depending on what those are, you could be the asshole for that, even if you're legally in the clear, especially since you'd be disregarding your mother's very clearly expressed wishes. You'd also risk permanently alienating your family. Ask yourself if that's worth $37K (and I am well aware it's not chump change) \n\nThe other is to let go a claim against the estate but get your siblings including Sara to sign some kind of contract to repay you. This shouldn't all be on you. \n\nIf Sara is a full time caregiver she may not be able to get a HELOC to repay you.", "I gather that you have three siblings besides Sara. If they feel that you should be willing to make sacrifices to help Sara, then why don't they split the burden with you? If each of your three other siblings repaid you $9,250, and you forgave the remaining $9,250 of the debt, then you would all have contributed equally to Sara's support. \n\nIf they aren't willing to do that, then they are not morally justified in criticizing you for being unwilling to let the $37k go.", "YTA for a few reasons here. \n1. You refuse to wait for your brother/the executor to talk to an attorney, which is literally happening later in the week. \n2. Several people have made outstanding points, like getting a new contract or a lien against the house, you absolutely will not hear out a single word of it, just repeatedly saying she will not pay and I\u2019ll never see the money. That\u2019s where contracts and liens come in, they are literally there to protect you. \n3. You state you are QUITE financially stable right now and that you do not need this money right this second, but you\u2019re also unwilling to help find any workarounds for your sister and her MULTIPLE children, you\u2019re happy to make her homeless. \n4. You CLAIM that you and John are willing to give her your shares but are unsure if the other siblings will. But that it could also screw with the benefits she HAS TO HAVE to take care of her child so you all are willing to essentially hold onto it and what, give her as you see fit? And the other two siblings - who realistically shouldn\u2019t be getting a dime but will if you do this - have said nothing about THEIR shares. \n5. You are willing to make your sister and her children homeless over money that you are not in dire need of right this minute. \n\nNo one in their right mind is telling you you should walk away from 37k and just be fine with that. But they are telling you to take a step back and find out all the information before jumping and you have zero interest in doing that, OR accepting the judgement you requested when it\u2019s not going your way.", "INFO, how much would your share be if you sold the house, given the current local market? If your share would be more than $37k, and you\u2019ve already said you\u2019d be giving your share to your sister, then what\u2019s the difference between giving her the $37k through selling the house or forgiving the $37k debt against your mom\u2019s estate?", "Yta.  Give them time.  Let her take over the loan.  If you don't you really are violating your mother's wishes and evicting them at a terrible time.  Try to stay calm.  Let them know if they lapse payment for more than 3 months you will put a line on the house.  Anything other than that is cruelty.", "I can\u2019t get past the irony that the original loan was, in part, to adapt the house for your nephew and that now those same adaptations have put his ability to live there at risk.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't just want to sell the house to get it away from Sara, you also want to ensure she can be cut from any monies from the house since the will indicates the house goes to her and any money from the estate goes to the 4 of us. In addition, your mom's intent was never for you to get the house money. \n\nIf you want to make this as your mother intended and protect Sara then the estate pays you the 37,000 out of the sale of the house but NONE of the rest of the money is split between anyone. It all goes to Sara in a trust so her and her son's benefits are safe and they can buy a home.", "Is your sister worth more or less than 37k to you?

Figure out exactly what was outlined in the will; who gets what money, etc. If the will was written by a lawyer, I doubt it was left intentionally vague.\n\nI'm just speculating but maybe there's a way to take out a Heloc on the house... you get your $37k and your sister and husband have to pay back the Heloc.

So it\u2019s $143,000 divided four ways. She still gets something, but yes, she is out a house.\n\nIf the house is sold, it\u2019s the estate paying OP back, so the money doesn\u2019t just come from sister\u2019s share.", "If the house doesn\u2019t get sold, OP only gets his share of the little bit of money in the bank.", "Yeah, that's a good question as well. Like, is this house paid off? I have a lot of questions about details that really affect their options here. I think as a group they need to meet with a financial advisor and a lawyer. \n\nIf they can get equity to cover the loan, that really would be the most simple option as you said.", "Yeah, it sounds like any blame in this situation should be directed at those other two siblings for their greed.", "I needed to decide if I was making a claim - which I am.  Now we have to figure out the consequences and that is what the talk with the lawyer is for.", "He needs to speak to the attorney to know what the ramifications of having to sell the house are. I would love to attend if I can and I'm sure John would let me.", "My guess is around $5K - so I would lose around $32K.  \n\nYes - the estate can negotiate. But I won't accept that.  That is too big a loss.  It was a matter of just a few thousand I would go for it - but not this much.", "Then I'm not that good of a person.  No one would expect me to write her a check for $37K - but this is basically the same.", "I would argue that OP does in fact need the money. It\u2019s wild to think OP should continue renting and forfeit the money they would use as a down payment just so the sister can be a homeowner.", "I stand corrected, but realistically I wonder if she can afford it.", "Oh and also to me that is a lot of money but you don't seem to be in a tight situation or really need it currently. If you let your sister sign the loan, then at least you can claim it if you ever got into one.", "I've already committed ( as has my brother John) to giving Sara our \"share\" of the proceeds if that is how it ends up. I don't know if my other 2 siblings are willing to do that same.  I'm pretty sure at least one of them won't. I'm fine keeping the money in my name and using to pay her bills if that helps her keep her benefits. \n\nAs for if she could buy a different home - a lot of that depends on what my other two siblings do.  If only John and I give her our shares - no. But she would have money to rent a new place for a decent amount of time.", "Then they don't get a say. I would still make sure Sarah had a contract with John cosigning, so she knows you are willing to do it and pesters him. In theory he would only pay if she can't.\n\nEither way unfortunately you either lose money or your siblings, your mother unintentionally screwed you. Because there are no other choices for your sister, and she is actually doing her best.", "I would add this to the main post, because co-signing the loan is the first solution that comes to mind for many people", "If they aren\u2019t willing to help then file the claim \n\nNta", "Totally on her. It sucks that she was dealt a rough hand, but doesn\u2019t mean that you have to suck up a financial hardship like that.

Your mom died through no fault of you or the sister I\u2019m assuming\u2026 and you\u2019d effectively be making her homeless so I could understand her being upset. Quite a pickle to be in, I personally don\u2019t think I couldn\u2019t go through with it as it seems it would cause irreversible harm to my sib and nephew. The debt was mom\u2019s, mom\u2019s gone and I would chalk it up to helping a parent.\n\nIdk if it makes you the asshole but it doesn\u2019t feel right.", "It's not going to be just Sarah.\nDon't kid yourself.", "As I understand it, she'll commit to pay you back, if she doesn't she'll have to sell the house to pay you back.\nThis means you give her the opportunity to pay you back, but if she can't, you'll get your money either way.", "So knowing your sister struggles with money, has a disabled child and it was your mother's wish she gets the house so she and your nephew are safe with a roof over their head, you are more worried about money that you admitted wouldn't horribly screw you over if you didn't have it? If she struggles with money that much how in the world do you expect her to able to afford anywhere to live with your nephew? It's a lot of money yes, but sometimes you sacrifice for the people you say you love.", "No, but you'd have a lien on the house that would have to be paid out eventually.", "That\u2019s a promise that can be trusted.", "Ohhhhh. I wonder if there isn't some way that one of the siblings could take the sale money instead, buy the house of her choosing (whatever they could afford with the sale money), and then either gift it to her (tax burdens would apply), or let her live there rent-free. \n\nJust ideas. I feel like there HAS to be a way to make this right for all the siblings, and I urge OP to have a plan if she's going to do this so she doesn't lose her relationship with her siblings.", "I wonder if there is a way to place the money in a trust to pay for Sara and the kids' monthly needs without interfering with the benefits.", "Like I said. You\u2019re entitled to that but your mother wanted her to have the house and you are the only reason that isn\u2019t going to happen. You can do it, you have every right to, but your family will probably never forgive you.", "But she couldn\u2019t get a house with that right? A safe place for her and disabled child for life is irreplaceable to her, especially with her shit credit and financial situation making it impossible to turn that 30k into something at all comparable. That money won\u2019t last her but a few months and then what??", "Do you realize that person isn't me?  And that I am female?", "For 60%-80% of market rent, lots of people. You should explore that option first.", "They're not wrong though. They're probably saying exactly what your family has said to you. You're trying to justify an objectively immoral act by painting your sister as a loser. You demonstrate no compassion. No mercy. And a complete disregard for the safety and well-being of your nephew, who by your own words is \"severely disabled\". \nYou're giving lip service to helping your sister financially, when the best thing you could do to actually help her and your nephew is the house. The more I read over what you've written and the comments you've made, it sounds like your jealous/butt hurt, that your mother  spent so much time and money on your sister, and not on you. This is petty revenge, plain and simple. So yeah, YTA.\n\nYou simply can't handle someone telling you exactly how absolutely reprehensible your behavior is.", "It\u2019s $180,000 divided five ways, which is only $36K, and why OP says she will get nothing if the house sells.", "The house appears to be paid off, based on this information from the original post.\n\n> She didn\u2019t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K)", "you know the consequences. you\u2019re just too greedy to care about them.\n\n may the home you by yourself always be filled with black mold and termites.", "I'd write a check for my sister for $37K, no questions asked. But that's me.", "No it's not at all and what you're doing could harm your innocent nephew who needs a stable home more than anything.", "Absolutely not the same at all.", "John won't do it and I don't blame him. I don't believe she'll pay and neither does he.  Why would he sign up to pay the loan back?", "Sata didn't have anything to do with the loan.  The mom did", "My sister has great intentions.  If I do what you are suggesting that I know I will be facing drama every month when she doesn't make a payment. I don't want to put myself through that. Not only that - but it would take her years to pay it back.  My Mom was paying me back at least $2,000.00 a month.  The loan would have been paid back in about 18 months. My sister couldn't do a fourth of that. \n\nIf she can get a loan from a bank - great.  But I won't loan her the money directly.", "At least with contractor liens, they only get money when the house is sold.   They can't force a sale.", "That could be 40 years from now.  So no - I'm not willing to wait that long.", "It seems like either another sibling pays op back or the claim goes through. The sister was already struggling with the mom paying bills. Now she doesn\u2019t even have that help. Will the sisters be able to pay the bills to the house solo? In the long run the sister may need to sell the house", "I don't have a plan. I won't lose my relationship with any of my siblings with the possible exception of Sara.  Sara is upset about possibly losing the house - which I can't blame her for. But I'm not willing to walk away from $37K and she doesn't have any other ideas either.", "Unfortunately, at least in the US, Social Security has thought ahead.", "Yup, this. There's a difference between being legally right and morally so.", "No - you can't buy a house of $30K. I agree with you there.\n\nHowever I find it ridiculous that I am being asked to spend $37K on Sara's housing and my siblings are being asked to do nothing. And why? Because I agreed to loan my mother $55K interest free to help her save money.", "OP takes the $37K before any dividing happens, just like a creditor. Once OP gets her $37K repaid, then the remaining money is divided.\n\nThe reason Sara gets nothing if the house is sold is because the will was written such that she gets a house but no money.", "Greedy for wanting their own money back? Lol", "To basically put his money where his mouth is. If he is arguing not to file the claim he should have a stake in the loan.", "Your sister couldn\u2019t afford life before, which I absolutely hate to type. but knowing her bank account runs in the red each month tells me she\u2019s going to lose that house to unpaid taxes or bills. Your siblings are not facing reality here, by filing a claim and forcing the sale you are just speeding up the inevitable outcome of this scenario. \n\nFile your claim. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s you who will be angry at them, and you\u2019ll still be out the $37k", "I guess what they mean is that would make it very clear to her that it isn\u2019t just you screwing her if john also isn\u2019t willing to sign", "Is there a way for you to sign a contract with your sister which states that as soon as your sister gets the house she must get a loan against it to pay you back what she owes?\n\nIf none of the siblings are taking responsibility then, maybe they can foot $5000 -$7000 a head so that you can forgive the rest as a gift?\n\n I know $37k is too much for just one person to gift/forgive, but if you share it among yourselves it will be like $5000 -$7000 damage individually.", "I would not blame him too, if he stayed in his lane, but calling you greedy and refusing to co-sign a loan is an asshole moves in my eyes, the remaining siblings could renounce to their part of the monetary inheritance and devolve it to repay their sister debt, but I suppose it\u2019s easier to call you \u201cgreedy asshole\u201d.", "They won't take a hit to their finances and feel they are righteous to refuse, but want to call you an asshole for not taking a hit to yours.\n\nIf he thinks it's ok for you to eat a loss, it should be ok for him to eat one too. Otherwise he is a hypocrite and can STFU.", "Right, and the estate (aka the house) is technically (in a legal sense) the mother. So she promised something to the sister without actually having it.", ">Will the sisters be able to pay the bills to the house solo?\n\nThis is kind of what I'm wondering. Is her sister financially independent? Even close? If she isn't going to be able to stay afloat even with no rent/mortgage payment, then the whole idea of her \"keeping the house\" was never going to last anyway. \n\nThough, it really depends on how much the sister's bringing in, what her income limits are, how much her other bills are, how big the house is, etc.", "I've thought about that as well.  I know that without Mom's income in the house - Sara is signing up for some additional benefits.  But I have a hard time believing it will make up for the bills that Mom always paid. When I asked Sara she gave vague answers - which is standard for her when she doesn't really have a plan. \n\nMy guess is that even if Sara gets the house - she won't have it for long. But I could be wrong.  Mom knew a lot more about Sara's finances than I do and she thought Sara could keep the house. So maybe there is something I don't know.", "I mean if she basically continues the same situation, but with her sibling owning the house instead of her mom, I don't see how that would hurt her benefits. I guess it would need to be that way, instead of gifting the house.", "Yeah, you\u2019re right.  Regardless, OP goes from just barely nothing to over $70K in this.  Sister goes from a paid house to homeless.  I get it, he has every legal right to do it.  Still makes him an AH.", "Yeah...it's like, at least if OP forces the sale now then the rest of the money will stay in the family instead of going into the pocket of a bank or debt collector and you all could talk to a disability lawyer about setting Sara's share up in a trust or something so it would have as minimal impact on Jeremy's SSD payments as possible.", "Yep...make it so you're not the only \"villain\" in this story, so you have a solid defense for when some busybody relative inevitably gets up your ass about it. \"I offered to let her take out a loan to pay it back, but nobody was willing to cosign her on it, not even John. Such a shame\".", "I have feelings she not gonna. She already lived in the house and struggled.", "The thing is if sara sells the house herself due to not being able to upkeep then she would get all the money from it. Which hopefully if it came down to it she could provide for herself and child.", "I\u2019m not your lawyer. Seek advice in your own jurisdiction. \n\nI think the way the regulations are worded, it\u2019s in kind income if someone is paying your rent or living expenses. The fact that the owner of the house lives there too changes the argument, but if Sara lives alone, it\u2019s more obvious she is getting living expenses paid somehow.\n\nIf she could afford a mortgage, she could possibly use her proceeds as a down payment and only lose out on a bit of benefits.", "Sorry, is OP female?  If so, my bad.", "Why? The asshole here is the mother with her completely bonkers split of assets. There are a lot of countries where such a will wouldn't even be legal, because there are mandatory minimums each child gets.", "Yea this. \n\nAlthough i think its basically a certainty that her sister could get a refi loan on this. I think OP should chill out a bit, talk to some lawyers and figure out how to keep her in the house.", ">The fact that the owner of the house lives there too changes the argument, but if Sara lives alone, it\u2019s more obvious she is getting living expenses paid somehow.\n\nThis is something I didn't consider. Things do change depending on whether the owner lives there or not, don't they. \n\nSo I'm wondering if gaining a house as a gift affects SS benefits. And whether Sarah could take on the tax burden, and monthly payments if it isn't paid off.", "Yes, I am female.\n\nBoth my brother John and I have have agreed that we will give anything (other than the amount I get back from the loan) we get from the house to Sara.  I don't know if my other 2 siblings will or not. So Sara will not be left with nothing.", "They should definitely talk to a lawyer. I think there\u2019s ways to help sis, but non experts often muck things up and seek advice later when they\u2019re in hot water.", "But will what you and John give her be enough to offset the loss of a house?   $37K is a lot of money by most accounts, but not in the context a struggling sister and her disabled son losing the home your mother wanted them to live in.  This was her way of providing for them after she died, and you\u2019re taking that away.", "Why are you here tho? You\u2019ve been down voted to hell and back, jury is in, YTA, and your mind is made up. You\u2019re not budging, you don\u2019t seem to want HUMAN input, you want legal advice. YTA, get your money, go AGAINST your mothers wishes, and do what you wanna do."]}
