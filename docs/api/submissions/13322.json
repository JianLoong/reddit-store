Better to do it while he can still be asked about heirlooms and such. Give a copy (and keep a copy!) to the executor of the estate. Do not allow BIL to remove anything. \n\nYour kids are FIL's grandkids. Trying to avoid the unpleasantness with BIL would be at their expense not just your own.", ">He can have it. I was here caring for my in-laws out of pure love and respect for them and honoring my vow to my late husband. I would be content to walk away with what actually belongs to me and my kids and nothing more.\n\nGet what you can to benefit your child/children.  Also, who's going to take care of FIL's dog?  My guess is that it will be you.  If the dog gets sick or has a medical emergency that can get **REALLY** expensive.  I bet FIL would rather have you inherit some of his assets that can be used to care for his dog than to let his son who's never there get them.", "The first thing I thought was \u201cI hope she\u2019s taking the dog!\u201d Brother would probably throw the dog in the shelter.", "My papa died at his home. It was so important to him to be in a safe, comfortable cozy house when he got sick. I can\u2019t even IMAGINE challenging his decision to die in his own home. My granny died 6 months after him, in the same home they both shared. You are absolutely NTA! I\u2019m glad FIL had a daughter like you to care for him. As someone who recently watched my granny die, knowing that she was sick and preparing myself for it\u2026please take care of yourself during this time. You\u2019re giving so much love - please remember to give yourself that same love, compassion, and understanding when the time comes.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. You're  following your FIL instructions.  Absolutely take comfort in you're doing the right thing for the right reasons. Then get nerves of steel and buckle up. Death makes people weird and selfish. Stick to your guns.\n\nEdit : spelling errors", "NTA. It doesn't matter what Seth wants. You are your fathers-in-law's healthcare surrogate, so Seth has no legal right to demand that his father be institutionalized. Do what your father-in-law wanted, if that is at all possible. If it is not, it will still be up to you to decide what changes to the plan are needed, not Seth. Adult children that do not spend time with their parents need to understand that others that were there for them are better able to understand and fulfill their parents' wishes and needs, especially when the parent gave the legal right to someone other than their child in the first place.", "NTA and condolences for your loss. This is what he wanted and thank you for making sure it happened.", "NTA.  May his memory be a blessing.  Ghost Seth, he's an asshole.", "I just saw this and your edit. My heart is with you, may you be blessed beyond measure for doing all you have. I\u2019m so happy he went just the way he wanted to, with you by his side!", "Sorry your loss OP. I am glad it went as planned. \nAnd NTA from the beginning.  You are a great in- law that he obviously loved dearly.", "NTA \nSo sorry for your loss.\nYou're amazing!", "That update escalated a bit didn't it", "My sincere condolences. You did a great thing making sure you FIL died as he wished. He knew he could trust you.", "NTA. \n\nLet\u2019s pretend Seth really was trying to take the best care of you he could.

Thank you for advocating for him. He chose you for a reason.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I\u2019m glad he was able to spend his last days how he wanted and with whom he wanted.", "NTA. People do not realize both how expensive AND how horrible facilities are. You kept him at home. Not to be mean....but Seth is/was likely concerned about the expense of in home care in last days, reducing what he thinks will be his inheritance. \n\nFYI- I have played your role or assisted with your role with friends as their parents passed- with second spouses that were much younger wanting to use a facility instead of at home for last days, etc. If Seth is NOT a total AH, and the point was not moot at this stage, you can gently explain that facilities are very expensive, and the care is horrific in many.  At the best ones, someone checks on the patient every few (4-6) hours. For little more, 24/7 in home care (with doggo (s)) nearby, is a much kinder and humane way to let folks pass. As a third party, I have often been that person (well 3 times now), gentle explaining how nursing homes work, and costs associated with full time in home care vs nursing home care, etc. I am also in your role for about a dozen of older folks I know, since I have a medical background and frankly a pushy/assertive personality, so they know they can TRUST me to make their wishes happen.  And that is what you have done- you met the TRUST that put in you, as you should. Bless you and hugs for the loss of your FIL.  You are a good person- thank you.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace.", "NTA", " NTA I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Sorry for your loss. I'm glad he went the way he wanted and you were able to give him the gift of honoring his wishes.", "NTA\n\nThank you for giving that man and dog the best experience possible.  It is so cruel to our pets when we just disappear one day without them understanding why.", "I would actually suggest you change them right away before Seth can come in and cause problems for the grandchildren caring for him while you are at work.", "May we all have someone as compassionate and caring as OP in our lives when such a time comes. FIL and MIL chose the right health surrogate.", "Seth wanted the minimal amount possible being spent to preserve the estate he thinks he will get.  Ignore Seth. DO what is right- and keep doing that after the passing- FIL has wishes for his estate.  And my guess is it ain't for Seth to pillage it.", "Take care of $$$$ getting into their own accounts is what they mean though :(. Ask me how I know.", "Same situation with my granny and papa. They both passed at their home (it was my home, too). We sang my granny her favorite songs and held her and talked to her until the very end. It was lovely and so, so hard. Grief is a mother fucker.", "Admirable- but it is ok to make sure the executor of the will limits Seth's access to the estate. Because your FIL likely left the majority to your kids, and any other grandkids.  Don't let Seth steal from the estate that FIL went to so much effort to preserve for his grandkids.  You have been AMAZING so far- but the job is not quite done. Morn- but keep the legalities in place and in control of Seth's efforts to derail FILs wishes.", "You have something his son will never have, Class.  OP, the universe looks fondly on those who care for others with pureness in their motives...you have earned yourself some Huge Self Care of your own now.

You took on an unexpected role and played it beautifully....I hope the world offers you it's best in return \u2764\ufe0f", "Ahhh fuck that first sentence was a gut punch because Granny and Papa is what we called ours too. The rest of the details mean you're not one of my cousins, though. My Papa passed with Granny holding his hand, and Granny followed him 2 months later while her two oldest kids were feeding her ice cream.", "Exactly. And even if you don\u2019t want Dads things for yourself, think of your kids", "Bless you for honoring and protecting your father in law\u2019s death plan.

Of course your are NTA -", "My mother had 24/7 CNA home care for a couple of years and home hospice care at the end. They brought in a hospital bed to make it easier to care for her.

(Some said it was part of a \u201cplan\u201d.) She had rapidly advancing vascular dementia and other health issues. I spent days with her at her home and my brother nights. After close to a year, my brother called one night to tell me he\u2019d taken her to the hospital, she was complaining of abdominal pain. I got to the hospital and he left to go to work. The dr came to see me and told me Moms bowel had burst and was spilling toxins into her body. We discussed her options and he told me that if she survived surgery, it was doubtful her body could survive the toxins and I made the decision to let her go. She was in a great deal of pain and she and I had already discussed her fears of the dementia and I knew what her wishes were. I called my brother and told him and he thanked me for being able to make that decision because he didn\u2019t know that he could. \n\nMom was moved into Hospice and I was there 15-18 hours a day until she passed.
