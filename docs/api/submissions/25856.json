I'm okay with her dad but nowhere near as close to him as I am my mom.\n\nThe news that we had not had any contact in 7 years was news to my mom and she promptly dropped it.

They probably told you that so that you would feel guilty.", "NTA. It wasn't your fault that the step-sis is stranded, and if the mom and dad really wanna help the sis, they should have find an alternatives solutions.

Most humans extend some level of mutual aid to the people in their family circle. You don't choose to. That's ok but it means others in your family circle won't trust you to be there for them.

I hope you're never stuck yourself.", "ESH.  You grew up with her from 7 to 18, she is not a \"stranger\".  I understand she is not close and her dad could have done more perhaps but you were there and you turned away like she was an enemy.  It's not like they asked you to board her, it was one night.  You could have called those safe hotels yourself.  \n\nFailing to have any basic human kindness is an AH move.", "INFO: would you let a friend-of-a-friend stay, if they were desperate?

They are ashamed of you, too.", "NAH\n\nYou lived with this person for 8 years, and wouldn't help them out in a bind?\nYou don't 'owe' anyone anything - but I think it's shitty to not have helped.

NAH because technically you don't owe her anything - though I think you're kind of an asshole.", "YTA \n\nYou left a woman alone in a strange place.  Just because you hadn't had contact in 7 years?  That's just plain disgusting.", "YTA \nAs others have said you arent strangers, you just arent intimately acquainted. Are you afraid she\u2019d steal from you or hurt you? If the answer is no then you\u2019re definitely TA. You couldn\u2019t let her sleep on your couch so she didn\u2019t have to sleep at the bus station or a random hotel? I highly doubt your room mates would have had an issue with your step sister staying in the house for a literal night.", "YTA. She had to stay in a bus station. And you never had any issues with her or reason to mistrust her- you just didn't know her that well.
