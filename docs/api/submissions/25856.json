Not to mention I live with roommates so it's not like it's my decision alone.\n\nI have known my stepsister since we were 7 but we did not bond as siblings despite living in the same house and never cared about each other to stay in touch once we moved out for college. I don't know if she still feels the same but we used to consider ourselves only children and I still consider myself an only. She's in no way close to my mom. I'm okay with her dad but nowhere near as close to him as I am my mom.\n\nThe news that we had not had any contact in 7 years was news to my mom and she promptly dropped it. But her husband and her MIL were furious that I would think of that as a good excuse to leave a young woman in a strange (to her) place without somewhere to go.

A person you have no connections or ties to;\n2. A person you have never met in person.\n\nFor option 1, she\u2019s  his stepsister, he therefore has ties and connections with her, them being his mom and her dad.\n\nFor option 2, he definitely has met her in person. Not only that, but they actually lived together for 11 (ELEVEN) years. That is a really long time!\n\nThe fact they never bonded, or formed a direct one on one relation, does not mean that she\u2019s a stranger. It just means they aren\u2019t close.\n\nA stranger would be, for instance, a homeless person asking him if they can spend the night at his place. That is a stranger, and with that comes the danger. You don\u2019t know this person, you don\u2019t know their history, you don\u2019t know their intentions, and if they do something wrong to you (like stealing) you have no way of tracking them down.\n\nHis stepsister, with whom he already lived ELEVEN years, needs a place to crash for one night (not even 24 hours, just the one night). \n\nI would understand the reluctance in welcoming her if she needed a place to stay indefinitely, or still for an undefined period of time. But for one night? What\u2019s the old up? What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\n\nIs she going to murder you? Unlikely. Too many witnesses (your roommates), and your parents would know that she was there that night (unless they\u2019re in on it too!).\n\nIs she going to steal from you? More likely than the previous scenario, but still unlikely.

And those examples are basically strangers, this is someone you knew from age 7-18 and who is still quite close to your parents. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly sad how many people don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to do the bare minimum for other people in an emergency.", "Exactly!

This would be understandable for a teenager, but a 25 year old should have learned by now, so why didn't they?

Growing up in the hood, you learn real fast the world is dog eat dog and can't depend on nobody but yourself, lol.. but when I pulled my way out of there and interacted with the rest of the world, it was mind-boggling to see there are people out there that trust others for things in life that actually have significance. (Although, admittedly, one thing I hate about the world outside the hood is how incredibly two-faced everyone is. Nobody wants to speak their mind and would rather speak behind backs. I hate it.)", "Roommates wouldn\u2019t care for one night unless OP had to clear every single person that stays the night there", "Yes, the AHs pretty much run it.  The most unkind people have more time on their hands. I wonder why.", "I grew up in the hood and us black people that grew up with are a village"]}
