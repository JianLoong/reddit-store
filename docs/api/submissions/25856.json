I was stopped at the border for being a runaway. \n\nIn Vancouver I got myself a room for the night, got back on the bus, then went back to Seattle where I got a plane ticket to AK. \n\nI paid for it with my summer job money. \n\nI know that was a different time but come on, is she an idiot? Or do your parents treat her as such?", "Why didn't she take her in?", "I think she could have asked you herself, it's the least she could have done considering she was trying to stay in your place for the night", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s actually a stranger to you.", "I note that the stepsister didn\u2019t call you directly and that leaves me wondering if she was equally unenthusiastic or wanted family pressure brought to bear. \n\nYou\u2019ve had no contact for 7 years and she expects the parents to baby her, she can sort out her own shit.

This is that brow beating, guilt we feel when we say no to something that we truly don't want to do. Everyone is laying the onus of her safety on you when it's just so very, very wrong.\n\nYet another situation where the blame is incorrectly placed. They can try to blame you but I think we all realize it's not yours to accept. You don't owe many people much, and here you owe no one anything.", "NTA. From my general life experiences, you don't just end up somewhere with nowhere to stay. And 7 years is a long time, a lot can change. So that most definitely is a stranger.", "NTA - she wasn\u2019t stranded if there were hotels available.\n\nIf you were in her shoes, you would get a hotel too, not stay with a stepsister you are not close with and had not been in contact with in 7 years.", "INFO- Why was she stranded?  How come nobody knew that you two were not in touch? Why didn't her relatives chip in for a hotel room?", "Info:  how would the sister even have gotten there?", "NTA. Staying at bus station for 1 night is not the end of the world. You don\u2019t owe her a place to stay.", "They asked, you said no. End of. NTA", "Nta", "NTA. She's 25 - the least to expect is for her to plead her own case. \n\nThe situation isn't particularly clear. You make it sound as if she's just stranded for a night because of a SNAFU with the bus schedule. In which case a hotel or hostel is perfectly fine. \n\nThis is not to say there aren't versions of this story where refusal to lend a hand in some way wouldn't ever into AH territory. If her side of the story is something like \"I was left injured / assaulted in a strange place, and my stepsister wouldn't even swing by, sit with me and help me sort out the next steps\", and your relationship is as you describe - neither hot nor cold, no great love but also no resentment - then, well, it would be your prerogative to not help, but you could expect the rest of this side if the family cutting you off. But then you'd be TA simply for misrepresenting the situation. Based on what you wrote, nothing wrong with your actions.", "NTA\n\nExpecting anyone to accept a virtual stranger into their home on a moments notice is unacceptable. \n\nTheir attempt at a blended family did not work out and they need to accept that.", "NTA. She's a stranger. Who let's strangers in their house to spend the night.  Uhhh..no one..", "NTA.  Sounds like your mother needs to take her in, then.", "NTA", "Unless you guys are in Florida rn NTA. Idk why they would expect you just to take someone in that you haven\u2019t had a relationship in 7 years. You have no obligation.", "JFC, I honestly can't stand my step sister and I'd never leave her to sleep in a bus station\n\nIt's basic human decency\n\nYTA", "NTA \n\nwould it have been nice? sure, but as you said NC for 7 years and when your mom heard that she backed off. makes me wonder what mom is hearing from the others. but how did she get stranded? poor planning and she just assumed she could stop off?", "NTA. She\u2019s 25yrs old, I am dumbfounded how she is stranded with nowhere to go? I\u2019ll be 25 soon and just a couple months ago my friend and I took a plane to a city we\u2019ve never been to before. We met up with a friend but plans had to change so me and plane friend had to book a hotel. We figured it out all by ourselves because we are adults. Are you in some crime ridden area where public transit or cabs routinely feature people getting killed? Like what is the emergency?\n\nOh I completely glossed over that she couldn\u2019t get a room - I am very surprised by that. Do you live in the destination capital of your area? How could she not find a single hotel room? But also, would you have changed your mind if you had known of this apparent scarcity of hotel rooms? I would say you\u2019re an AH if you knew that apparently she could not find a room and made her sleep in a bus shelter. Letting someone stay in a hotel room is not an AH move but allowing them to stay in a bus shelter is.", "NTA in the slightest. She's a step who you haven't seen or talked to in 7 years. She isn't family and is a stranger at this point. She was safe staying the night at the bus station.  Plus, if it was so urgent. Why didn't she reach out to OP herself to ask. It's telling that she didnt", "NTa", "Exactly what I was going to say. She can go to a hotel and parents can call with a credit card number. I don't know where they are, but I have a hard time believing there wasn't a single hotel room available.", "[removed]", ">She couldn't get a room anywhere so I think she stayed overnight at the bus station \n\nI'm confused.

Money might not have been a factor.", "[deleted]", "I live in a town where all of the hotel rooms are routinely booked. If you're a destination city it happens a lot, especially short notice", "Maybe she didn't have a credit card on her.", "I think that the \"can't get a hotel room\" thing is a lie.

Like yeah, technically NTA but like kind of a dick move if there's no reason not to at least check with roommates other than \"we're not close.\"", "What if his roommates are all men?

Most importantly, have you ever been in a bus station? Overnight? With crowds of people, lots of security, and hard seats? Unless he lives in Podunkville, BFE,  she was safe. Uncomfortable possibly, but safe. Your own personal form of misogyny is showing.", "You've never heard of emergencies or unforeseen circumstances? Hell, maybe the bus she was supposed to take broke down, and the next one wasn't until morning...\n\nWe've got no info, one way or another...", "What does the fact she\u2019s a woman matter? Are you insinuating she can\u2019t take care of herself because she\u2019s a woman? Sounds sexist. She 25 yr old adult. She can figure it out.", "It is kind of a dick move, but it should be pointed out that we have no idea what the circumstances were that led her to become \"stranded\". You saying it was of no fault of her own is an assumption. It's definitely possible that she's directly at fault for becoming stranded.
