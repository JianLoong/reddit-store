I really dislike seeing \"abelist\" thrown about as an epithet when someone doesn't get a situation adjusted to their specific liking.\n\nIf the child in the wheelchair is permanently physically challenged, she will find as she goes through life she will not be able to participate in everything she'd like to, and the world at large will not turn on its axis to align with her desires. The ADA only goes so far. It sucks, it's not fun or fair, and I do get that it's the child's mother rather than the child who got into name-calling about completely changing the party activities. \n\nWhen it comes to fairness, it isn't fair IMO to replan an entire elaborate event in honour of your daughter's birthday, a party for a group of children, to accommodate 1 child.

She can go in the bouncy and sit inside with a FEW other kids bouncing on their bums/taking turns.  With an adult in there with them to supervise (so, might have to get a slightly bigger bouncy?

My mom and I have talked about this before (my sister was in a wheelchair from 8yrs old on---she is mid-40s now) and as a parent, they go through grieving cycles/acceptance/passionate advocate/maintain.....and even if you are emotional stably, people aren't perfect and even nice people do shitty things sometimes.

Have activities that Penny can do alongside the other kids.\n2. Don't invite Penny\n\nIt's just unreasonable to invite Penny to a party where you know there is nothing she can do. Of course, if you're inviting the whole class except for the kid in the wheelchair, you're also the asshole, for different reasons.\n\nIs Penny a particular friend of Ava's?

If you are ever in the position of hosting another disabled child at this type of party remember it\u2019s very easy to make it inclusive- give the disabled kid a water gun to shoot pool jumping kids with or water balloons to toss at em.

The thing is that this OP asked what activities she could *add*, the mom had zero suggestions. Rather, she wanted the party *modified*. OP was completely open to *any* ideas that could include Penny.\n\nBut no, the mother gave no input and immediately went to name calling with very serious and potentially damaging accusations. Honestly, at this point I would be extremely hesitant to take responsibility for her child at my home risking further false accusations, nor would I want *any* involvement with Penny\u2019s mom. \n\nOf course I wouldn\u2019t turn the child away if she happens to show up, that would be horrible!  I\u2019m betting that her mom has put her in embarrassing and uncomfortable situations many times, however I would again be very hesitant to extend future invitations. No way this is the first time she has heard her mother falsely call people inconsiderate abelists. I\u2019m sure we all agree that OP sounds like a perfectly lovely and reasonable person who had no intention of making Penny feel isolated or not included.  \n\nMY side note: In these types of situations, it\u2019s a often a tough call as to whether I might want the mother to stay at the party so she can help involve her daughter, but not here. This woman has the potential to ruin the party and further humiliate her daughter. I am also quietly hoping Penny *does* come, and the other kids dance with her, the Disney princesses go all Disney magic with her, she gets to socialize *away* from mom, eats cake with ice cream, is made to feel included and has a blast\u2026\u2026.just like all the other kids. \ud83c\udf89", "This is so not true across the board.

Some children can have support needs that mean they must stay in their chair or have specific handling needs. \n\nIf this is the case, Penny's mother mentioned dancing, castles and swimming. Dancing is out unless it's on a flat surface, which could be provided. Princess and castles could be made accessible but it sounds like they're not big enough for Penny's wheelchair. Swimming would be out, but the hosts could arrange games to be played with people in and out of the water. \n\nNone of these are big asks, with the possible exception of the castles depending on how they're made. Penny's mom isn't asking for the activities to be cancelled, or even for them all to be accessible to Penny, just for adaptations so Penny can join in. You could adapt to include Penny without the other kids missing a thing.\n\nIf you're not going to make small efforts to include a child with a wheelchair, why invite them. Be honest and exclude them from the start. YTA.", "I hope Penny's mother doesn't go around calling her physically challenged, because everyone is that.  It's a big thing in the disabled world, and using disabled is a better option.  A LOT of parents call their kids challenged or with special needs instead of coming right out and saying disabled, as if there is something wrong with using the term disabled.  Caretakers and teachers often say special needs too instead of disabled even though special needs have been found to be a dysphemism that is harmful to disabled people.  Penny's mother is definitely harming her child but showing her that she has to go through life by demanding that others go around and create a world for her instead of Penny going around in the world as it exists and finding ways to be happy in that world.  Sure, she should request that ramps be put in where they legally can, just like I should request for interpreters where I legally can but I'm not going to expect everyone at the party I've been invited to to talk to me the way that works best for me.  It's my responsibility to go to others and talk to them the way that works for me, and this is why I bring a pen and paper and my cell phone to facilitate communication.
