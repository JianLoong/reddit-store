Living your life from a wheel chair is not easy and it often means finding ways to have fun despite the situation being against you. With that said, I'm sure this girl would find ways to participate if she were allowed to go.  Other children tend to be pretty acclimating.  They'd want to help her because we tend to have the most fun while experiencing vicariously through others.\n\nI strongly believe if the mom lets her daughter go, the child will wind up having a great time.", "NTA. You offered to add activities that everyone could do and she turned you down. It is kind of ridiculous that she thought you should cancel activities. This is not a school function, this is your kid birthday party. You can have whatever activities you want to.\n\nOn a side note I would add a couple of activities everyone could do so she could be included in something if she shows up. Not because the mom complained but because it is the nice thing to do for her child.", "\nI feel really bad for Penny. When I was in college, I took care of a special needs child who is also in a wheelchair. I took care of her and her twin sister. They were both nine. When we all decided to go swimming, I took Emily out of her wheelchair and I held her while we jumped around in the pool. The same goes for dancing I would hold her and dance around with her. Her mother is really the problem here because her child can participate in the activities if she stops treating her child like she can\u2019t participate in these activities. The child I took care of always felt like she was a part of everything because she was", "NTA - The party is for Ava.", "NTA. You are being very reasonable. It is bullshit for them to expect you to change all of your plans to accommodate for a single child that isn\u2019t your own.", "NTA. It's your daughter's day. I really dislike seeing \"abelist\" thrown about as an epithet when someone doesn't get a situation adjusted to their specific liking.\n\nIf the child in the wheelchair is permanently physically challenged, she will find as she goes through life she will not be able to participate in everything she'd like to, and the world at large will not turn on its axis to align with her desires. The ADA only goes so far. It sucks, it's not fun or fair, and I do get that it's the child's mother rather than the child who got into name-calling about completely changing the party activities. \n\nWhen it comes to fairness, it isn't fair IMO to replan an entire elaborate event in honour of your daughter's birthday, a party for a group of children, to accommodate 1 child. Perhaps you could've compromised with some seated party events, but after how rude and demanding the girl's mother was, you're under no obligation to.\n\nI understand advocating for your physically challenged child, but getting angry and berating other parents isn't the way.", "nta\n\nim sorry but its planned and changing a whole party is not going to happen", "NTA, wtf did Laura want????  How exactly should you \"modify\"?  Change the entire party to painting plates??", "NTA\n\nYour daughter's party is about her. The activities planned should be about her. Asking for input about things to add was the best way to handle it. But Penny's mom is out of line. She has zero right to LIMIT what you provide for your daughter. \n\nWhile I feel bad for Penny, her mom makes inviting Penny to anything else a bad idea. It's a shame when parents ruin things for their child, by pulling entitled behavior. She isn't doing Penny any favors, and will absolutely cause Penny to be excluded in social events.", "NTA\nIt would be unfair to your daughter to deny her the activities she is looking forward to.", "NTA.\n\nI am disabled. Never would I think someone would change THEIR birthday to accommodate me.\n\nNow if they demanded I go I'd inform them that they chose an activity I couldn't participate in and therefor wouldn't go. \n\nPenny's mom is acting entitled. Now I know Penny probably gets excluded a lot for stuff but it's different if it's a giant \"hey we are all friends let's hangout\" vs someone's birthday.\n\nI have food allergies. I expect my birthday cake to cater to my allergies. I don't expect my friends birthday cake to cater to my allergies bc its not my birthday? \n\nShe can go or she can not attend but don't make your daughter not have the birthday she wants because of this. Birthdays are the 1 day a year that's about just them and nobody else. If it wasn't a birthday I'd be different but teaching your daughter that she can't pick what she wants on her birthday bc of a kid with a disability will end with her resenting said kid.", "NTA.  Penny's mom is doing her child a huge disservice.\n\nFor one, at 8yrs old...all of those things can be slightly adjusted to include Penny w/o her having to \"be on the sidelines and have no fun\".\n\nSwimming with an adult and a life vest.  She can go in the bouncy and sit inside with a FEW other kids bouncing on their bums/taking turns.  With an adult in there with them to supervise (so, might have to get a slightly bigger bouncy?  We got one rated for adults so we could have fun, too, lol). Twister, Penny can call out and spin the board. II mean, we always fought over who got to run the board, it was the thing everyone wanted to do.  Dancing, well, one doesn't have to dance standing on their feet.\n\nPenny's mom saw insult were there wasn't any intended.  I am not sure what kind of modification Penny's mom was wanting?  Idk.  It would be different if y'all were going on a zip line or go to a Six Flags amusement park.  Then you would need to choose if the activity is more important that having a friend there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing to add:  I suspect that Penny's mom is angry at life right now, and lashing out in general, and not YOU specifically.  My mom and I have talked about this before (my sister was in a wheelchair from 8yrs old on---she is mid-40s now) and as a parent, they go through grieving cycles/acceptance/passionate advocate/maintain.....and even if you are emotional stably, people aren't perfect and even nice people do shitty things sometimes. In this situation, Penny's mom is the asshole, but I can also empathize with getting frustrated that NOTHING is ever just easy.", "Not your problem.  Not Penny's party.  Her mom keeps this up and Penny won't even be invited anywhere.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou would be a massive AH if you ruined your daughter's party to cater to someone else's entitlement.", "NTA. It's your daughter's party, I do not understand why is Penny entitled to have the entire party changed. Penny's mother is TA for guilting you.", "Nta. As a parent to a special needs child I never assume that there will be any accommodations for him. I bring along whatever I need to for his needs and never ask the host to.", "NTA-\n\nYou invited her yet her mother felt compelled to tell you to change how YOUR daughter's birthday was for someone else, even if they have special needs.", "NTA. Moms Penny is. So entitled. Its Avas party and its all About her. You even tried to add an activity for Penny to join. The world Will Not adjust to Penny", "I think you are a complete love to have invited her, I figured her mother called to see which ones she would be able to have her daughter be assisted with.  She could probably do trampoline, dress up, scavenger hunt. As the fun mom, you can figure this out", "Lol NTA not your fault that kid has problems. Your daughter is your concern as she should be.", "NTA. The party is for Ava and you can't make everyone happy.", "NTA", "Soft YTA.\n\nYes, it's Ava's party, and this is about doing things she wants to do. But you're inviting her classmate Penny to a party where she is going to be able to do nothing. That's ridiculous - why are you inviting Penny to a party where there is nothing at all for Penny to do.\n\nYou've got two reasonable choices:\n\n1. Have activities that Penny can do alongside the other kids.\n2. Don't invite Penny\n\nIt's just unreasonable to invite Penny to a party where you know there is nothing she can do. Of course, if you're inviting the whole class except for the kid in the wheelchair, you're also the asshole, for different reasons.\n\nIs Penny a particular friend of Ava's? If they're friends, then perhaps you could invite Penny to celebrate Ava's birthday on some other occasion, with wheelchair-accessible activities.", "NTA. \n\n I feel for Penny, but it was rude of her mother to even think that it was ok to say, Modify your child's party, for her child's needs. \n\nYes, I know it sounds horrible to say, Sorry but the party and activities are what our child wants. \n\nWhen Penny stops receiving invites, her mom won't think it's because of her expecting others to change things to accommodate her daughter's needs. Good for Penny's mom advocating for her daughter, but wrong of her to think her child needs and wants outweigh the birthday girl's needs and wants.", "Slight YTA. Sounds like you knew about Penny prior to invite. Planned something for all but Penny.   Sure, party is about Ava, but thought should have been given to classmate in some way. Of course don\u2019t need to change everything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Maybe ask her Mom what she had in mind to make the activities more inviting for Penny, while politely keeping your plans.
