He has like a twitch account or whatever and quite a few people donate to it. He has over 300k subscribers. He often allows his subscribers to game with him in his party or whatnot and I can always tell when it's a woman because he deepens his voice so freaking low. I find humor in it honestly because it's so obvious and I'm not sure how his subscribers haven't picked up on it. His voice is completely different when he games with his male subscribers. \n\nSo I'm sitting next to him at my own gaming PC. He has been streaming for quite awhile at this point. Well he just joined a new gaming session and his voice did that change that he does so I knew for a fact a girl was in the lobby. I peeked over and sure enough, there was a woman. A woman I have seen in his lobby multiple times. So I start laughing to myself and as he continues talking, I'm finding even more humor in it because it's such a fake deep voice and I don't know. It's just funny. \n\nWell, he gets off the game and immediately asks me why I'm cracking up. So I tell him that every single time he games with a woman he lowers his voice and talks all slow and drawled out. Almost like he is trying to seduce people with his voice and it's fucking hilarious to me. He immediately said he didn't do that, which of course made me laugh even more because I've noticed it so many times at this point that there's no sense in denying it. I'm not even mad. It's just funny. Either way, he says I'm an AH for \"making shit up\" and stated \"even if I fucking do that why would you laugh at it?

That\u2019s hilarious! You should absolutely record him so you can play it back for him. Also make sure you have an example of what he sounds like with you or with guys.

Mine changes on its own depending on the persons age. I\u2019ve never intentionally done it. It\u2019s once dropped close to an octave when talking to one of my girlfriends friends boyfriends. And it freaked the friend out. My girlfriend seemed to be mesmerized by it.", "Yta", "I\u2019m going with NAH, tho I feel that you\u2019re slightly more the AH in this situation.\n\nMy husband has obliviously said certain words and phrases totally different than what he thinks he says and it\u2019s only recently come to light that he says them different (accent/pronunciation). He absolutely did not realize he was doing it until I gently teased him, and said it\u2019s because of the way so-and-so of his family says it the same way and he just never realized, and I only picked up on it because I\u2019m an outside-looking-in and around him more than anyone else. I can tell who he\u2019s talking to on the phone based on his pitch and wording. It\u2019s all unconscious on his part.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s okay that you found it humorous but probably should have been more gentle and understanding. Because yeah he is probably going to become overly conscious during the next interaction which will most likely be picked up on by his followed which could lead to anxiety and what have you. And if he\u2019s earning an income from this, that makes you an AH for possibly causing a loss of income in that regard.", "Yeah I'm pretty sure he does it on purpose but who knows LOL", "She doesn't even have to do that. If hes a twitch streamer he probably has some lives saved that show the difference", "Side note: My husband has different voices for a few different people, but not this extreme. The other day I heard him using his \u201cTony voice\u201d in the other room and called out \u201csay hello to Tony for me!\u201d and he was freaked because Tony had called out of the blue (which he doesn\u2019t do often), until I let him know that he had a \u201cTony voice\u201d (plus voices for two other friends and his mom). They both (hubs and Tony) had a good laugh about that!", "He used to! LOL I'm not sure when he stopped. He still does it occasionally when he's deliberately trying to be \"funny seductive\".", "Yeah now that I know he's self conscious about it I will definitely try to control my reactions from here on out.", "No, lol but he has gamed with a guy with a gamer tag that sounds similar to that.", "I don't want to give too much away to spare our identity BUT his gamer tag is something ridiculous.

Where's the holy water when I need it?", "Lol", "Found the boyfriend", "It's definitely on purpose.\n\nWhat makes it funny is that he only does it when women are in the lobby.\n\nI used to DJ with pirate internet radio stations long ago. I would use a deep, raspy, gravelly voice. It helped with getting listeners as it was akin to the Wolfman Jack distinct voice. So, I get using a different for listeners, etc, when you're portraying a persona that's different from what is your \"normal\". But, just because a woman is in the lobby? When you have a fiance'? That's just funny and deserves the laughter.", "That's hilarious! My fiance is the same way. The way he speaks around his mom is very soft and soothing.

He's doing it on purpose btw. If it was an unconscious thing, he would have laughed at it.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I was teaching from home. My wife said my Teacher Voice is completely different from my normal voice. Far more tight and professional and yuppie. When my wife told me I busted a gut.", "NTA surely he can look at his streams and confirm.  He is just embarrassed.", "Aww he sounds lovely lol", "Is he Batman? NTA.", "NTA\n\nI have different voices for adults, children, animals and pets (yes, apparently pets and animals are separate lol). \n\nBut unlike your fianc\u00e9 I don\u2019t do it intentionally and ,again, unlike your fianc\u00e9 I find it hilarious when someone points it out \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. It\u2019s funny. I can definitely tell when my husband is talking to a woman on a customer service call. I think it\u2019s adorable. His mom always knew he was talking to me too, before we got married. :-)", "NTA. \n\nGood for you. He SHOULD be self-conscious about speaking, because it will lead to self-awareness. And that could go a couple ways, but still. I would have been laughing too.", "I'm going to give you a YTA not a huge asshole but a small one. \n\nIt just feels like your bullying your fiance.\n\nEven if he did deepen his voice, does it cause you any harm?

You're pretty much always the jerk when you're making fun of your partner for something they didn't realize they were doing.  No one wants to feel self conscious in their home with their person.  :(", "And this is how you treat the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.
