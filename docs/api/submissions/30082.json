She has always been criticizing me for most of my childhood and even after I got my own house and soon to be wife girlfriend. So the house I got was a simple 1 story house with 2 bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. After I showed my mom the house she ha absolutely no positive feedback, only it would have been better like this and oh this does not look the best. Then the last straw was when she complained about my girlfriend. She made fun of how she looks and how I could have done better. I from then cut most connections with her and blocked her on all form of social media. A few Years later me and my newly become fiance have sent out wedding cards to lots of friends and family. Im still unsure but my mom had managed to get her hands on one of these. A few weeks later at the wedding when i arrived I saw my mother out front talking to a few of my aunts. When she saw me I immediately tried to remove he from the wedding area. Luckily my best friend had managed to drag her out of the area to the place where all the cars were.

Invited.\n\nYou had every right to eject your mother from the wedding when she has demonstrably proven to only ever have criticism for you, and to be frank a mother who only has criticism for her children is demonstrating both a lack of pride and a lack of love in their child. I mean, if the best you can say about your child getting a place is, \"your place sucks,\" that isn't helpful information and is just a deliberate put down. Nobody needs that level of toxic nit picking in their life.", "Nta", "Thanks man appreciate it", "\"She is not abusive that enough to be remove from your life because boo hoo she is the mother.\"\n\nThanks to these abusers and abuser defenders, it is very hard to live in peace.
