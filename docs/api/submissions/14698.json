She will be our one and only for several reasons, mostly it is not safe for me to be pregnant again. But she is our 10 year longed for baby so we are happy. We wanted her name to be special and my husband and I wanted to honor his late mom. She died when he was 7. She developed the nickname The Calla Lady because she sold calla lily flowers from their garden when my husband was a child to earn extra money (she was sick most of his life and unable to work but she could do that). Her name was Hannah. But Calla was a name that reminded my husband of his mom's strength and he remembered his mom commenting that the name was beautiful. We both agreed, plus it was extremely special and meaningful which we wanted for our only child. So our daughter was named Calla. A name that I think fits her beautifully.\n\nWhere this whole post comes in is after my husband's mom died, his dad remarried and his stepmother took over as the primary parent. My husband did not want a second mom and did not bond with his stepmother. She was unable to have children of her own so added extra pressure to my husband and had more expectations of their relationship. She hated how he refused to let her be mom. The relationship with both her and his father is very strained today. She would not have known the nickname or where our daughter's name came from. But my husband's father would. After we announced the arrival of our daughter with her name (days after she was born because I was recovering slowly at first) we got a comment from my husband's father saying the name was an odd choice.\n\nFast forward to a month ago and they stopped by for a random visit and his stepmother told us it was really terrible that she and our daughter would be reminded that she is not her real grandmother by honoring his late mom and that we should have considered her in this. My husband was struggling with shutting her down and I think wanted to say some things that he maybe second guessed. So I told her she could not live in a fantasy world and pretend his mom did not exist and she is the only mom/grandma in the family. I also told her she does not to name our daughter. She and my husband's dad accused us of being cruel and shitting all over her in an effort to make everyone know she's not wanted. They told me what I said was uncalled for and still look for an apology. My husband thanked me for what I said though. But I have asked myself if I went too far with what I said to his stepmother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681401641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ktw2y/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_stepmother_she/", "score": 1345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whats up with older generations thinking they are owed something in regards to grandchildren? And honestly, honoring your husband's mom is NOT the same thing as dishonoring the step mom. She sounds incredibly selfish.

You doing some of his fighting was very much a welcome relief for him.", "First, Calla is a lovely name and very elegant.  \nSecond, while you may not have been terribly tactful with how you phrased it, you're right.  Your in--laws have zero input in your naming choices, and they'd better get used to it.\n\nNTA,  and congratulations on the birth of your lovely daughter.", "NTA. \n1) anyone who challenges the name parents choose to give their child is TA\n2) anyone who bring up the disagreement with name a year after the birth is double A\n3) you stated the truth. It maybe hard to hear but truth nether less. You have nothing to apologize for", "NTA I\u2019ll never understand a step parent wanting to replace a parent that has died. There\u2019s definitely a healthier way to go about bonding with a step child.

She deserved a good slap down, lol.  The biggest reason your FIL defended her is because he HAD to, he has to live with her and she would've made his life hell if he hadn't.  \n\nYou don't owe her a single thing.", "NTA-  it\u2019s a tribute to a woman that your husband cared for.  You have every right to name your child what you see fit.  The fact that she takes offense to it is just a symptom of a bigger problem with the relationship between your husband and her.  She is not his biological mom, and if she didn\u2019t die the stepmother would not be in the picture.  Possibly your husband took his grief out in this woman, and ever since they have had a strained relationship.  But that\u2019s not the issue here.  She may feel that she will always feel like she is not wanted in his life, and that should be handled by him, not you.", "I'm going to say NTA it sounds like your husbands step smother needed a huge wake up call that she doesn't get what she wants by trying to force your husband as a child to forget his mother and let her take over, and she's not owed anything, nor is she entitled to be making demands about what you name your child. \n\nCongratulations on your daughter", "NTA at all.

That is all you need to know. Spouses should support one another. You are definitely NTA. Well done.", "NTA. Your husband thanked you. Maybe you should've said it in a different way, and you can apologize for HOW you've said it (if you feel like that).

She didn't leave you any choice.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s already an AH move to offer unwanted opinions about your baby\u2019s name. It\u2019s even worse to somehow think that a name is a slight against you when talking to a child who lost his mother at a young age. Good for you for standing up for him, it\u2019s probably something he\u2019s wanted to say for years but knew it would cause a blowup. This step mom sounds insecure and she notionally unstable.", "Your husband's step mother has been and is still being AH for ignoring your husband's mother's existance. Her trials of bonding with your husband was sadly traumatic and disrespectful. She obivously still in the lack of understanding that.\n\nYour words might have sounded harsh but I will go with NTA. This problem may be solved by talking about each one's feelings. I actually suggest family therapy if your husband is interested. It would be very beneficial for their relationship.", "NTA. Stepmom\u2019s a psycho.", "NTA - Sorry your husband didn't do this, but somebody needed to.", "I have to go with a strong NTA here, because you were acting to support/guard your husband and your child from external interference, and your husband appreciated it.", "NTA. Her insecurities do not get to dictate how you honor the people you have loved and lost. \n\nI found this whole story sad.

It doesn't matter who approves or likes your daughter's beautiful name, or the meaning behind it.  This situation is what it is because your husband's father and stepmother didn't understand that.\n\n2) It's unfortunate that your husband's stepmother couldn't have biological children. I have empathy for her, for that. She wanted to have  \"a child of her own\". However, you cannot force a child to bond with you. You cannot replace a parent. Especially by force. That will drive the child away. The opposite of what you want. You cannot erase a child's memory of their beloved, deceased mother. As your in-laws discovered.\n\nI dont know the reason that your in-laws chose not to adopt a child. I don't know why they thought that forcing your husband to accept a \"replacement mother\", and forgetting his mother was right, but it wasn't.\n\nWelcome, Calla!

I fucking adore those kids with everything I have and I love that my bond is different than their bond with their mother (who is a really lovely woman)\n\n\nI NEVER wanted to replace their mother, and I actually had a tough moment about a year into the relationship, when the youngest, who was 5 at the time, got upset because he wanted to call me Mam and I had to tell him no, that (Mam's name) was his mother, and it would hurt her feelings to hear him call me a name that is specially hers.
