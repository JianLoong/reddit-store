She will be our one and only for several reasons, mostly it is not safe for me to be pregnant again. But she is our 10 year longed for baby so we are happy. We wanted her name to be special and my husband and I wanted to honor his late mom. She died when he was 7. She developed the nickname The Calla Lady because she sold calla lily flowers from their garden when my husband was a child to earn extra money (she was sick most of his life and unable to work but she could do that). Her name was Hannah. But Calla was a name that reminded my husband of his mom's strength and he remembered his mom commenting that the name was beautiful. We both agreed, plus it was extremely special and meaningful which we wanted for our only child. So our daughter was named Calla. A name that I think fits her beautifully.\n\nWhere this whole post comes in is after my husband's mom died, his dad remarried and his stepmother took over as the primary parent. My husband did not want a second mom and did not bond with his stepmother. She was unable to have children of her own so added extra pressure to my husband and had more expectations of their relationship. She hated how he refused to let her be mom. The relationship with both her and his father is very strained today. She would not have known the nickname or where our daughter's name came from. But my husband's father would. After we announced the arrival of our daughter with her name (days after she was born because I was recovering slowly at first) we got a comment from my husband's father saying the name was an odd choice.\n\nFast forward to a month ago and they stopped by for a random visit and his stepmother told us it was really terrible that she and our daughter would be reminded that she is not her real grandmother by honoring his late mom and that we should have considered her in this. My husband was struggling with shutting her down and I think wanted to say some things that he maybe second guessed. So I told her she could not live in a fantasy world and pretend his mom did not exist and she is the only mom/grandma in the family. I also told her she does not to name our daughter. She and my husband's dad accused us of being cruel and shitting all over her in an effort to make everyone know she's not wanted. They told me what I said was uncalled for and still look for an apology. My husband thanked me for what I said though. But I have asked myself if I went too far with what I said to his stepmother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681401641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ktw2y/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_stepmother_she/", "score": 2352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whats up with older generations thinking they are owed something in regards to grandchildren? And honestly, honoring your husband's mom is NOT the same thing as dishonoring the step mom. She sounds incredibly selfish.

You doing some of his fighting was very much a welcome relief for him.", "First, Calla is a lovely name and very elegant.  \nSecond, while you may not have been terribly tactful with how you phrased it, you're right.  Your in--laws have zero input in your naming choices, and they'd better get used to it.\n\nNTA,  and congratulations on the birth of your lovely daughter.", "NTA. \n1) anyone who challenges the name parents choose to give their child is TA\n2) anyone who bring up the disagreement with name a year after the birth is double A\n3) you stated the truth. It maybe hard to hear but truth nether less. You have nothing to apologize for", "NTA I\u2019ll never understand a step parent wanting to replace a parent that has died. There\u2019s definitely a healthier way to go about bonding with a step child.

She deserved a good slap down, lol.  The biggest reason your FIL defended her is because he HAD to, he has to live with her and she would've made his life hell if he hadn't.  \n\nYou don't owe her a single thing.", "NTA-  it\u2019s a tribute to a woman that your husband cared for.  You have every right to name your child what you see fit.  The fact that she takes offense to it is just a symptom of a bigger problem with the relationship between your husband and her.  She is not his biological mom, and if she didn\u2019t die the stepmother would not be in the picture.  Possibly your husband took his grief out in this woman, and ever since they have had a strained relationship.  But that\u2019s not the issue here.  She may feel that she will always feel like she is not wanted in his life, and that should be handled by him, not you.", "I'm going to say NTA it sounds like your husbands step smother needed a huge wake up call that she doesn't get what she wants by trying to force your husband as a child to forget his mother and let her take over, and she's not owed anything, nor is she entitled to be making demands about what you name your child. \n\nCongratulations on your daughter", "NTA at all.

That is all you need to know. Spouses should support one another. You are definitely NTA. Well done.", "NTA. Your husband thanked you.

It\u2019s even worse to somehow think that a name is a slight against you when talking to a child who lost his mother at a young age. Good for you for standing up for him, it\u2019s probably something he\u2019s wanted to say for years but knew it would cause a blowup. This step mom sounds insecure and she notionally unstable.", "Your husband's step mother has been and is still being AH for ignoring your husband's mother's existance. Her trials of bonding with your husband was sadly traumatic and disrespectful. She obivously still in the lack of understanding that.\n\nYour words might have sounded harsh but I will go with NTA. This problem may be solved by talking about each one's feelings. I actually suggest family therapy if your husband is interested. It would be very beneficial for their relationship.", "NTA. Stepmom\u2019s a psycho.", "NTA - Sorry your husband didn't do this, but somebody needed to.", "I have to go with a strong NTA here, because you were acting to support/guard your husband and your child from external interference, and your husband appreciated it.", "NTA. Her insecurities do not get to dictate how you honor the people you have loved and lost. \n\nI found this whole story sad.

It doesn't matter who approves or likes your daughter's beautiful name, or the meaning behind it.  This situation is what it is because your husband's father and stepmother didn't understand that.\n\n2) It's unfortunate that your husband's stepmother couldn't have biological children. I have empathy for her, for that. She wanted to have  \"a child of her own\". However, you cannot force a child to bond with you. You cannot replace a parent. Especially by force. That will drive the child away. The opposite of what you want. You cannot erase a child's memory of their beloved, deceased mother. As your in-laws discovered.\n\nI dont know the reason that your in-laws chose not to adopt a child. I don't know why they thought that forcing your husband to accept a \"replacement mother\", and forgetting his mother was right, but it wasn't.\n\nWelcome, Calla!

No one who did know its origins could possibly see it as a slight against SMIL, except, apparently, your narcissistic in-laws who are so far up their own asses that they think you\u2019d choose *your baby\u2019s name* to spite them.\n\nYou said what needed to be said.", "NTA  \n\n\nProud of you for being your husband's knight during a distressing situation.", "NTA. You stood your ground  and sounds like they were maybe used to pushing ppl around or getting their way alot so this probably came like a shock. Cudos to you both", "NTA", "Your daughter's name is beautiful!", "It's not her fault your husband didn't bond w her...that being said NTA...it's your kid your decision.", "NTA step mother can\u2019t erase the past no matter how badly she wants and has no say on a baby that isn\u2019t hers :/", "Absolutely not. Even if she was the actual mother/grandma she would not have a say. It\u2019s your kid not hers", "Why would he say that to someone he doesn't love ?", "This is so sad, because if she had just backed off and not made him feel like he had to choose between her and his mom,", "\"Reasonable\" was the operative word.", "Wish my stepmother had known you. She was a fucking nightmare for me. \n\nI\u2019m glad your step kids have you though!", "I was lucky in that the only grandma that took an active role in my life was actually my step grandmother. She married Grandpa shortly before I was born. She respected my mom and they were close. I adored her.\n\nMom\u2019s mother suddenly died just before Mom started his senior year in high school. Dorothy didn\u2019t come along until years later. I\u2019m sure that fact made a big difference. Such wonderful women do exist, though!", "You know, I\u2019ve dated a widower, and it\u2019s a kind of weird place to be in.  And sometimes I would get in my own head, \u201cThey\u2019d still be together if she hadn\u2019t died, I\u2019d be insignificant to him if she was still alive.\u201d  And I recognized that it was a one way ticket to crazy town, but even I wasn\u2019t this bad.  How I felt was insecure here and there about a new experience that didn\u2019t turn out to be a roadblock in the relationship overall once I got past it.  But what this lady is doing is destructive. It sounds like she\u2019s been ruining this family for years, and is continuing to do so.", "Just as a side note, my bestfriends dad used to add in pancakes as well for dinner, you know for some carbohydrates \ud83e\udd23.", "What if I just want fried chicken? \ud83c\udf57", "TIL I\u2019m a misandrist. But I\u2019m a hermit so no innocent males are harmed. Just only innocent me harmed by males. So. Misandrist it is.", "NTA. If they literally kept their mouths shut, she could've easily still been Grandma to the baby. The baby wouldn't even understand the whole concept of her birth grandma (?) until she's much older anyway. So now, Grandpa and Grandma just got demoted to Grandpa and STEP-Grandma.", "LOL..I remember my Dad on this, every time they have a new grand kid (they already have 8 and 1 on the way), he wants us to name them after his parents but we tell him no and he accepts it with no hard feelings..we love our grand parents and we can honor them with some other ways, not necessarily naming our children after them..we nicknamed our first child with the first syllables of my dad's nickname and my FIL's nickname though..anyway, NTA OP..", "NTA. You didn\u2019t even say anything harsh. It was just true. If anything step mother in law was out of line in the first place trying to erase your husband\u2019s mother. \n\nShe should be glad she is being asked to fill a grandmother role and never expect to replace the memory of the child\u2019s actual biological grandmother.\n\nThe name is beautiful and congratulations!", "NTA: It's not that she's not wanted, just not for the role she wants. She could have accepted your husbands choice & forged a different bond, but she chose not to.", "Easy NTA, and it's a nice unusual name. Unusual, but not crazy, it's a good choice.", "Well if we have to speak every langage of the world to name our child we do not name it at all..", "Oh please, it will probably morph into Callie at school which is a completely normal name.", "This, this, 1000x this. Tell the grandparents that if they want to continue to be grandparents then SMIL needs to understand that that child is no more hers than your husband was and she doesn't get a say in any of your lives. Take it or leave it.", "Exactly, step dad here. My step kids biological dad plays no role in their life, he abandoned them and abused my wife. I hate him for it, but I can't erase him from them. If they ever want to attempt to find him and meet him I wouldn't stop them. Their mother has told them her side of why they are not together, if they want to hear his that's up to them and if he's turned his life around and wants to be a dad after all these years then great.\n\nI just try and get on being a better parent than he ever was, rather than worrying about it.", "I would strike a lot of 'quirky' names. The kid's life isn't a punchline for mom and dad's sense of humor.\n\nSpecifically thinking of one where mom wanted to name her identical twin boys 'Sean' and 'Seen'.", "Yeah, anything that is obviously guaranteed to make the kids unhappy."]}
