So he became my first priority and the girls came after him. They did not like this. Why on earth would I choose him over them?

I have like\u2026 mild criticism for not talking your reasoning through with the nieces and giving them time and space to jointly work through their understandable painful reactions about the choice you made to raise their half brother, but only super mild because (a) I know EXACTLY how hectic single parenthood is and (b) their ACTUAL FKN PARENT should have gotten into this with them! Ye gods, what the hell was he thinking? Genuinely, I\u2019m starting to have some sympathy for Sister here because if the dude couldn\u2019t see past his own butthurt to help his kids process their trauma in 18 years, I shudder to think what kind of husband he\u2019d have been behind closed doors. Cheating is the cheaters choice and responsibility, but it doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. \n\nI have nothing but admiration for your decision and follow through in stepping up for Jack though. Specific to the question you posed, NTA: you\u2019re his parent (IDGAF whose DNA was involved at conception) and you\u2019re being openly proud of him, celebrating his milestones, and generally being wholesome.

You can post whatever you want about you and your child. I don't even understand the hatred towards him, he didn't do anything but be born. You stepped up and took care of him when his mother couldn't. I don't understand the hatred towards you either. Your family is way too invested in your sister's life. She cheated, it happens. It shouldn't end with your entire family disowning you. Be disappointed, be mad, be hurt, but damn. You did a good thing. Continue to be proud of your relationship with Jack.

She sounds exhausting to be around. \n\nAlso there's no way that your niece accidentally saw the photo - your mother deliberately showed it to her and then twisted the story to get the reaction that she needed to guilt trip you. \n\nIn all of this, Jack is an innocent party. He never asked to be born and you've raised him in the years since. The fact that your family appears to bear him ill will is very telling about their attitude to life in general. \n\nLife's too short to be around that sort of negativity and toxicity. \n\nYou're never going to win, but you can continue to be the best person in Jack's life since it's clear no one else will be.", "I mean I understand that they are probably not mad at him, however being mad at you for this is kind of worse, I can\u2019t imagine how Jack must be feeling knowing he is a reason they are mad at you.

Just idea that they be mad cuz you love somebody they don\u2019t, shows me how controlling they want to be over your own autonomy. \n\nPeople are not good or bad only, nuances exist, your mother seem to be expecting you to be \u2018perfect\u2019 in a way she imagines and ironically being super AH herself.", "The nice would be in their 30s now?

Not even his mother. He knows the history and all that and has expressed no interest in having a relationship. This is a bit corny but it makes me happy so I\u2019m sharing anyways, he says that I\u2019m all he needs.", "Agree.  If sister has turned her life around and tried to make amends, then by 18 years down the road this family should have been able to move on and forgive her. If she hasn\u2019t, then I guess they could still be angry at her, but definitely not at Jack or the OP.  They are truly awful.", "Your mother sounds like an unreliable narrator, is it possible she made that up to guilt you?", "Alright, that clarification is helpful.

I went to a Christmas party once a couple years ago when Jack\u2019s friend invited Jack to his family\u2019s Christmas but my nieces decided to not come because I was there. After that, I decided no more. I was guilt tripped the whole time too.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not hard to maintain a relationship.

That\u2019s too weird for me to overlook. Definitely some missing info there.\n\nIt\u2019s also weird for your family to suddenly react to tattoos after 18 years. There were no freak outs about any other posts about him? So it was easy for them to ignore you raising this kid for 18 years but you cross a line if you guys get matching tattoos? Also why would a picture of a tattoo cause a breakdown?\n\nSeriously, what are these tattoos? Are they shocking in some way? Did your post about them also include a comment that publicly aired your backstory and some of the family\u2019s dirty laundry? I feel like there is so much missing here.\n\nUpdate: I just wanted to add that, even if your post was an over share, you have a right to your own story and you\u2019re still NTA", "NTA. I get that affairs rip relationships apart, but your family took things way too far. I get being pissed at the sister and not wanting to raise Jack, but for most of your family to cut you off because you stepped up is over the top to me. And then to still be so pissed off 18 years later and melting down because of a picture? They all need serious help.\n\nETA: What you did in raising Jack is a wonderful thing that many people, myself included, wouldn't want or be able to do. Especially, with the way your family reacted.", "NTA. Not at all. You know why they hate you? Because you're a good, good person. Unfortunately, this makes you and Jack the black sheep of the family. You're a good person, please remember that. \n\nYour family's opinions don't matter. What you post on YOUR OWN Facebook page doesn't matter. There is no need to censor yourself. If your family never speaks to you again, it doesn't matter, because they've proven to you that they don't deserve to have you and Jack in their lives. And I'm really sorry to say this, but your beloved nieces are not nice people. You  don't need them in your life, either. Why? Because you're a good person. \n\nJack is a good person because a good person raised him. You've succeeded. You've kept him from being corrupted by your family's toxicity. Post whatever you want on YOUR Facebook page. Post about how wonderful your son is on your Facebook page. Brag about your son's accomplishments on your Facebook page.

Bad things happened and you took him in (you're awesome) but then your family decided to hate you to for (checks notes) raising someone elses child.\n\nNow your nephew/adopted son (still a completely innocent party whose only known crime is existing) is 18 and your family who still hate you are following/stalking your social media to pick a fight as soon as you post something meaningful about him?\n\nI feel like there's something missing here.", "NTA you did a wonderful thing and honestly your family has something seriously wrong with them. They're mad you raised a helpless child? What am I missing?\n\nBlock them all. Tell Jack that the internet is proud of him and you. Go eat an ice cream together", "NTA they can run around denying the past but that doesn't make it your fault when reality breaks up their delusions.", "NTA\n\nAnd sorry but your family sound disgusting. You and Jack sound amazing and would be better off without them having any kind of access to either of you", "NTA.

Effed up sister clearly fell from an effed up family tree. \n\nSister has a lot of responsibility here for the hurt caused to her daughters (I'm hands off on the husband; behind closed doors and all that), but she doesn't own all of this dysfunction. She isn't responsible for her daughters' inability, *as adults*, to realize Jack is not the one who harmed them. Nor is she responsible for her birth family's inability/unwillingness to forgive or love her or Jack...or for her birth family and ex doing squat all to help their own granddaughters/daughters deal with their trauma, instead magnifying, enabling, and participating in it for nearly two decades! And she is in no manner responsible for her family's bizarre and punitive behavior towards Jack, or the woman who raised Jack, who is also their family member. \n\nThis entire family dynamic is FUBAR.", "Lol well for the record I think your decision to raise the kid was great and your matching tattoos are great. It\u2019s a real testament to your strength and ability that you were able to do so well raising him considering the origin story. I\u2019m sorry that your family is so unsupportive and overreactive. It\u2019s a shitty combination. I seriously relate.", "Opie look at the product, the fruits of your labor and tell me is there something you missed. You have described a healthy, happy and kind-hearted boy. \n\nSo you should not doubt yourself in any way or feel like you missed something; do you know who did miss something, your family, all those years of fighting and resentment has made them not to get to Know Jack. \n\nBut you know what it's for the better do you know why because of what is before you, like I said and like you said Jack is happy and His Kind; so what else can you hope for.
