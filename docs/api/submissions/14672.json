So he became my first priority and the girls came after him. They did not like this. Why on earth would I choose him over them?

I have like\u2026 mild criticism for not talking your reasoning through with the nieces and giving them time and space to jointly work through their understandable painful reactions about the choice you made to raise their half brother, but only super mild because (a) I know EXACTLY how hectic single parenthood is and (b) their ACTUAL FKN PARENT should have gotten into this with them! Ye gods, what the hell was he thinking? Genuinely, I\u2019m starting to have some sympathy for Sister here because if the dude couldn\u2019t see past his own butthurt to help his kids process their trauma in 18 years, I shudder to think what kind of husband he\u2019d have been behind closed doors. Cheating is the cheaters choice and responsibility, but it doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. \n\nI have nothing but admiration for your decision and follow through in stepping up for Jack though. Specific to the question you posed, NTA: you\u2019re his parent (IDGAF whose DNA was involved at conception) and you\u2019re being openly proud of him, celebrating his milestones, and generally being wholesome.

You can post whatever you want about you and your child. I don't even understand the hatred towards him, he didn't do anything but be born. You stepped up and took care of him when his mother couldn't. I don't understand the hatred towards you either. Your family is way too invested in your sister's life. She cheated, it happens. It shouldn't end with your entire family disowning you. Be disappointed, be mad, be hurt, but damn. You did a good thing. Continue to be proud of your relationship with Jack.

She sounds exhausting to be around. \n\nAlso there's no way that your niece accidentally saw the photo - your mother deliberately showed it to her and then twisted the story to get the reaction that she needed to guilt trip you. \n\nIn all of this, Jack is an innocent party. He never asked to be born and you've raised him in the years since. The fact that your family appears to bear him ill will is very telling about their attitude to life in general. \n\nLife's too short to be around that sort of negativity and toxicity. \n\nYou're never going to win, but you can continue to be the best person in Jack's life since it's clear no one else will be.", "I mean I understand that they are probably not mad at him, however being mad at you for this is kind of worse, I can\u2019t imagine how Jack must be feeling knowing he is a reason they are mad at you. It is really a childish behaviour. \n\nJack is a person, not a trinket you bought while on vacation, I get he is a reminder, but it is also a reminder of what good heart you have to take him in, and how people can grow and be awesome, independent of mistakes of their parents(jacks bio mom)\u2026 it is really how you frame it and the narrative is in Their hands (especially how they chose to present Jack to your nieces). \n\nI am sorry OP,I know when it\u2019s your own family it\u2019s hard to see, but these people don\u2019t seem like good people. Just idea that they be mad cuz you love somebody they don\u2019t, shows me how controlling they want to be over your own autonomy. \n\nPeople are not good or bad only, nuances exist, your mother seem to be expecting you to be \u2018perfect\u2019 in a way she imagines and ironically being super AH herself.", "The nice would be in their 30s now? What 30 year old is borrowing grandma's phone and having a massive breakdown over something that happened 20 years ago", "So your nieces supposedly care about you enough to name a child after you, yet they're the ones who cut contact? Doesn't sound like you chose Jack over them, sounds like they made that choice for you. They're grown ass adults now and should be able to understand that despite their feelings, Jack is totally innocent of everything, and is in fact also a victim of his own mother's actions (just like them!)\n\nGood on you for taking him in and sticking by his side!", "NTA\n\nYour niece had a breakdown because they wanted their half brother to grow up in foster care instead of having someone who loves him?\n\nBecause why?  Because his/their mom destroyed their family?\n\nHow is that HIS fault.\n\nStop pandering to their disgusting self interest.\n\nNTA", "Jack's only crime - being born. Something he had zero control over. Your entire family, except Jack, are disgusting horrible human beings. Here's hoping karma comes for all of them. They have no excuses for hating and excluding a tiny baby and then child. They are all garbage and I would personally have never spoken to any of them ever again because they aren't worth the steam off Jack's piss", "OP I just want to wish you, your husband, Jack, and everyone in your household the best of what this life has to offer. I can't gush enough about how much of a great person you are. I know a lot of humans, but you are definitely one of the best. Best wishes to you and your family.", "NTA.   What the actual f#ck?  What the hell is it that you supposedly did wrong?   I don't understand any of this.\n\nYou have done a great thing by looking after your nephew.  The rest of your family(?) can stick it up their a#**se.", "Jack did nothing wrong. NTA but everyone else in your family sure is.", "NTA.\n\nYour nieces are adults. It\u2019s been decades. And they have a breakdown when they remember their half-brother exists?\n\nWhat did they want you to do about Jack? He was an innocent baby in a terrible unsafe situation. You prioritized his life and well-being over the feelings of other people.\n\nYour family cannot bully you into harming or hiding a living human being because it makes them feel good.\n\nAnd if/when someone else harasses you about this? The response is, \u201cI don\u2019t care. Get therapy. I\u2019ll do whatever I want with my kid.\u201d", "NTA at all! \n\nYour family are being vile to you. You were the one to step in when no one else would. Instead of helping you, they go out of their way to be cruel. You were the parent that Jack needed. You were there for him. They weren\u2019t. \n\nThey\u2019ve resorted to horrid conduct because they know they\u2019ve spectacularly failed. Instead of owning up to bad behavior, they are mean. You showed them what being a parent was supposed to be like.", "NT Anyone blaming a child for being an affair baby is. They need to grow up. Don't ever doubt yourself for standing up for Jack.", "NTA You and Jack are the good guys in this story, everyone else can fuck right off!", "NTA your entire family is rotten. Who takes out their anger on a baby?  And continues to take out that anger for 18 more years? Cut all contact, delete them from all contact lists and move on with your life.", "NTA\n\nYour family are monsters. I'd never speak to them again. In fact, I'm not gonna speak to them for the first time, either!\n\nI do have one small gripe. You called yourself his aunt. You are that boy's mom, and I'll hear no argument on the matter.", "Poor Jack he deserves better than all these horrible people in his life.      \n\nHe was a lighting rod for everyone to project all the negativity for his egg donor's actions.", "Quite honestly Opie YTA if you start doubting yourself after 18 years of raising what i presume to be a healthy, happy and loved young boy. You are NTA okay. Your mother deserves to be cut off from Jack and your lives permeanately. She sounds toxic, rude and obviously playing favorites. \n\nMay I ask, how is Jack in all of this?\n\nDoes he know the whole drama and does he still want a relationship with the rest of the family in the future?", "I\u2019m betting your mom showed the nieces the pictures by the way", "Why would nieces even name their child after their estranged aunt? They cut her off on their own too so,  why?", "I mean. Their mom had an affair and then became a drug addict. Trauma triggers can rear their ugly heads suddenly.\n\nAnd some people are just so self-involved they\u2019ll hysterically cry when they don\u2019t get their favorite sandwich for lunch. Either way, niece needs some damn therapy.", "They could have been close to you as well and they chose to never talk to you again lol", "Have you not been to any family events over the last 18 years?  How did you maintain a relationship with your mom and siblings while being NC with your nieces?  Also considering how separate Jack has been from your family.", "I\u2019m betting your nieces would also expect if you have/had biological children to put them first too"]}
