For hobbies and other things that do not benefit the entire household, we have separate personal accounts.\n\nMy wife's family planned a reunion for the beginning of November. They're kind of flaky when it comes to cancelling plans at the last minute. Because of this, when my wife was booking plane tickets, I suggested that she pay a bit extra to ensure the ticket was refundable, just in case plans changed. She said, quote, \"that won't be a problem. I talked to my family and they are 100% sure they are going\", then booked a non-refundable ticket.\n\nWell, turns out that the trip got cancelled anyway because 3 of the 6 people coming got sick!\n\nWIBTA if I insisted that the cost of the plane ticket come out of my wife's personal account? The way I see it, because my wife unilaterally decided to book a non-refundable flight (against my suggestion), she should also have to unilaterally deal with the financial consequences.\n \nMy wife is arguing that the plane ticket should come out of our joint account because, had the trip not been cancelled, the joint account would have paid for it.\n\nEdit to add: a few people have asked if my wife's family was actually sick or if they were just using it as an excuse to avoid the trip. They were actually sick (one of them was admitted to the hospital for a few days, don't worry, she's fine now).\n\nEdit 2: it was suggested by someone in the comments that I mention that we usually DO buy refundable plane tickets. She said she chose not to this time because the non-refundable tickets were cheaper, had better arrival/departure times, and were from an airline she liked.\n\nEdit 3: thank you to everyone who gave their opinions, both YTA and NTA. After reading through everyone's comments, I still firmly believe I'm in the right on the purely factual question of who should pay for the ticket... but several people brought up good points about picking my battles instead of making a $400 plane ticket my hill to die on. I'll likely keep the ticket under the joint account, but will speak to my wife again about being more responsible with our money.\n\nFinal edit: I'm not sure why the top comment was removed?

It's also good to get some time away from each other occasionally (especially since we work at the same company).\n\nAlso, on a purely practical level, the personal accounts do not have enough money to consistantly fund travel.

You can't just use the benefit of hindsight to call this poor planning.\n\nAnd in order for it to be poor planning, the long-term math of upfront savings vs. refundability would have to work out. If the math doesn't work out in favor of buying refundable tickets over a lifetime, it's not actually poor planning.\n\nEDIT: I saw in your other comments that you usually book Southwest and that they allow rebookings.

Like that just sounds like you telling your wife that your bank account is also hers despite you guys setting up separate finances.\n\nPercentage-wise, the majority of our finances are joint. The personal accounts were created so we could budget hobby spending; both of us have a problem with limiting spending on hobbies if there are no stopgaps in place.

Her personal account tends to stay at around $100-$200 because she prefers to use it throughout the year for her hobbies. My personal account has more money in it because I prefer to save up and then make big ticket purchases a few times per year.", "Perhaps because she has to pay for plane tickets that were previously agreed would come out of the joint account.", "They agreed to buy the tickets with the joint account.

That is not her fault or her oversight. Get over yourself. \n\nLastly, if you do actually like your wife, stop treating her like a child.

Insurance has those limitations. Refundable ticket doesn't need a reason at all.

Usually that comes with a fee but I wonder if OP has looked into that.", "This is definitely something to consider! I\u2019ve had to try to get a refund for a refundable ticket before and a few members of the party being sick wouldn\u2019t have flown.

Imagine our distress and concern when we were told, no you pay and then you send reciept to insurance and they give it you back. We had no clue how much it was going to cost (we dnt pay for anything medical,its free here so we had no clue how much hospitals charge) so yeah you always need to check what your buying as it may not be what you thought it was.", "travel insurance for the win ;)", "That's kind of how I feel.

Spending your own money changes the equation of what is responsible to whatever that individual sees fit. That is not the case here.\n\nBeing a responsible solo traveler means taking whatever risk you're willing to stomach.

She hates Southwest, and if left to her own devices, would pay a premium to not fly with them.

Umm no. but when you are married you have ups and downs together. You share everything because you never want to see your partner struggle. \n\nAnd you don't punish your partner for mistakes either.
