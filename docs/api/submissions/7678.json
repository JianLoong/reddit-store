I literally make less than 1/10 of what he does but I\u2019d never imagine asking my brother to pay anything for me. The entitlement is disgusting. NTA", "Since when is the brother on the hook for the cost of a wedding? NTA", "ATAH, she needs to learn to budget her wedding to her means.  What will be next, down payment for a house, cover bills so she can be a stay-at-home mom.  Stay strong and make out of town plans for the day of the wedding!  If she does invite you she will go totally bridzilla on you.", "NTA. Not your circus. Sounds like sis needs to look into other options she can afford. Maybe a Baptist church wedding and a potluck reception\ud83e\udd23", "NTA- Why do people insist on spending a small fortune on one day?", "What the actual fuck??? She wants you to pay for her wedding and you\u2019re the selfish one?? NTA but your sister is delusional.", "NTA.  Is she worrying about being a good sister?  No.", "NTA. Tell her that it\u2019s her problem because you won\u2019t be guilted into buying her love. She clearly views relationships as transactional. \n\nWhy the hell does she expect her sibling to contribute in the first place? Your sister is a selfish, entitled AH.", "It is not your responsibility to bankroll her party. If she can\u2019t afford it or doesn\u2019t want to spend her money on her wedding then she should do what most adults do instead of making demands on others\u2014save up or scale down. The fact that she seems to feel entitled to your money is very telling that she wouldn\u2019t even be grateful and is just using you\u2014you all are, according to you-not even close anyways. Tell her you wish her good luck and happiness, but be firm that you are NOT going to forfeit your financial security and that she needs to find some other way to finance her wedding or reconsider how she plans to do it\u2014and end the discussion. Make it clear that you are not up for discussion after that. NTA", "NTA.  You are not responsible for paying for your sister's wedding.  That is on her and her fianc\u00e9e.", "Why did you waste everyone\u2019s time posting this?", "NTA. Let your sister have the wedding she can afford.  Keep your money.", "NTA whaaaat was she thinking? Don't pay for her wedding.", "NTA\n\nThey should just have a cheaper wedding, if they can't afford a super expensive wedding on their own with their own money and the money of people who are happily fully on their own offering them financial help. For example some parents like to contribute monetary to the wedding of their children. \n\nBut there is no obligation to do this for anyone. It is their wedding. They have to accept that they might have to finance it completely on their own.", "NTA\n\nWhen my older cousin got married, my sister and I put together to pay for his wedding cake. He didn\u2019t expect this of us but was thankful for the contribution as he was on a budget. \n\nYou have no obligation what so ever to put any money towards your sisters wedding if you do not want to. \n\nHowever, if you do want to do something (and only if you do) you could offer to make a small contribution towards the cake or something that wouldn\u2019t put your financial situation at risk. \n\nBTW, to me a small contribution could be anything from \u00a310 upwards and your sister should be greatful for any contribution at all because she isn\u2019t entitled to your money.", "NTA and in what world does the brother pay for the wedding? If you want to contribute throw some cash and say \"No gift\" then. This is ridiculous", "NTA- and if I were you I know I would have laughed in her face!  Tell her you don\u2019t have any extra money and why would she think you did?", "NTA - why do people have to have an expensive wedding anyway ?       \nAnd if she wants too that\u2019s her responsibility NOT YOURS !!!       \nJust ignore her or tell her that she\u2019s hurting your feelings by showing she doesn\u2019t care enough about you to not put your future financial stability at risk", "NTA by US culture /standards.  It's not tradition here for siblings to take on wedding expense's.  Maybe the bride/groom family will pay for wedding's here if they are financially fit for it but still it's more normal for the couple themselves to pay for their own wedding.", "NTA - why are you being expected to pay for her wedding?", "NTA\n\nYou really need to ask her for her actual reasons for why you should pay for it. And then come back and tell us, because I have never seen AITA so universally confused.", "Not your responsibility", "NTA - Give her a nice gift card. There are lots to choose from!", "Unless you're the groom NTA", "OP are you Indian?\n\nMy brother got married recently. And i can see visibly that my SIL' SILs were visibly fuming because their husbands footed half of the wedding expenses.\n\nIt's really bad culture. To bring up women just to freeload off their brothers", "NTA. Why would she assume you would contribute financially to her wedding to begin with? Have you talked about this in the past?\n \nYou plan a wedding for the money you have not dream of having.", "NTA- you do not OWE your sister a wedding. She is responsible for financing the things she wants in life. Yes, adulting is hard.", "NTA but also   \nINFO: Did you, at any point, make known the amount you have saved? NTA even if you did, but that may be where she's getting her expectation. Because you're her brother, and you have the means. (I'm by NO means agreeing with this sentiment, by the way OP.)", "NTA. It\u2019s normal to expect siblings to jump in and help. They should have the wedding they can afford.", "NTA! a: Expensive Dream Wedding, ok, if the bride and groom can pay for it. b: There are other parties to this event who might chip in. c: Sister is playing you.", "Yeah I have a million questions. Where's mom and dad? Is OP super rich? Is this a norm in their culture? Is this new or recurring behaviour for sis? \n\nI wanna say NTA because it seems like a ridiculous expectation in any circumstance but there is so much missing information.", "Funny you said bass ackwards. Today I just heard for the first time ever \"back asswards\" ...life is a simulation. \ud83e\udd2a", "I can see maybe springing for a bridal shower, but this is a bizarre request.", "Likewise. Absolutely baffled as to why a sibling would expect this.", "Are you sure that money is for the wedding? Could be that they are in debt that needs paying, or other issues. I assume you don\u2019t have an itemised list so it could go to anything. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s for good reasons like ivf treatment that she isn\u2019t wanting to discuss. \n\nWhatever the reason/s, you are not obligated to go into debt at all. NTA, just depends on how much you are invested in the relationship to want to find out.", "A bridal shower is still not OP's responsibility.  He's not close to his sister.", "I'm not saying it is.  I'm saying that a sibling pitching in for a bridal shower isn't outside the realm of normal wedding things.  Asking a sibling to pay for your wedding, on the other hand, is bizarre af.", "It would make her less happy not more to pay for a shower and still leave her way short of her real desire for the big fancy wedding.", "OP has to pay for my student loans first!!!\n\nObviously NTA.", "Yes. It is a known fact that each brother is required to buy his sister a Chanel bag & a pair of Louboutin shoes per year. Tell them to get cracking on that!", "Okay, again, just speaking of generalities, not this specific scenario."]}
