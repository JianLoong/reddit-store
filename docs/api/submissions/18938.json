I don't really like family dinners/get-togethers since I feel really bored' uncomfortable' and out of place there and there aren't really people to chat with so I mostly study or go through my phone)\n\nSo yesterday my father told me that we're paying my aunt a visit(not entering the house, just a visit by their door). He asked me if I would have a problem if there's going to be any guests at my aunt's house(by guests he means my cousins). I said yes (because I don't really like most of my cousins because there's a huge age gap between us and I can't really talk to anyone). He said ok and we went at 8 P.M. I usually sleep super early so I slept at the car.\n\nNext thing that I know, my father wakes me up and tells me to get out of the car. He told me that we're invited to a dinner and most of my cousin's are invited aswell. I got upset since not only my father didn't tell me that there are guests at my aunt's house, I clearly told him that I wouldn't visit if there's going to be guests. He told me that I shouldn't be acting so immature . we had a mini-argument at the car but at the end we got out of the car and went to my aunt's house.\n\nI was so sleepy and it was obvious from my eyes. I only said hello to people that greeted me first(and, y'know, acknowledged my existence). then sat at a corner and went through my phone(cause I had nothing better to do lol). I refused to sit at the dinner table cause I wasn't hungry and I was kinda sleepy. My father kept side-eyeing me on the table with an angry expression on his face. We left at 11 P.M. my father got so mad at me and told me I should grow up and, be more social, and me not sitting on the table was extremely impolite. he refuses to talk to me for now.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685869950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14077e6/aita_for_acting_immature_at_a_family_dinner/", "score": 1078, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA\n\nLearn to get along with people of different ages.  It will serve you well in life. You're a brat. Which is age-appropriate, we understand and forgive you,  but it is something you need to get over. However, it IS hard to connect with people. So you need ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some ideas to connect with people:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Find out if any of your elderly relatives like word games. Show them how to play Ruzzle, or Wordle/Quordle/Octordle on their phones or yours.\n* Ask the host/ess if they need any help. Help set the table or stir something. This will win you MASSIVE points.\n* Play with the littles. If they are between 1-3 they probably like bouncy games where you bounce them on your knee. Older than that and you can play Bear, where you growl at them and chase them around. Make sure there's a base they can get away from you. And keep in mind little kids like to make up rules in their favor as they go along.\n* Or ask the host/ess if you and the littles can build a fort out of patio furniture or couch cushions. Those kids will love you forever.\n* When someone asks you what you are studying or other boring questions old people ask you because they have no idea what to talk to you about, answer their question and then turn it around and ask them what THEIR favorite subject was, or about their youth in general. Ask them how they wore their hair in the 80s. In general, most people looove talking about themselves so if you get them to talk about themselves they will think you are charming.(Obviously don't do this to someone who is super shy)\n* People also like to be made to feel important, so asking for advice with problems will make them feel like you think they are smart.\n* Everyone has a crazy story in them. Try to find out what it is.\n* Bring a board game or cards and ask people to join you. Gamble peanuts or something.\n\nIf you develop a halfway decent relationship with just a few of these people, these sorts of events will be MUCH less tedious and a lot more fun.", "YTA like sure typical teenager behavior we are talking here about.

That's a sign there's underlying health issues so best to get checked out, even if the diagnosis is clear.", "ESH. Your dad should have been upfront about the situation. You should have shown some basic manners (although I can appreciate its horrible having to socialise when not necessarily feeling up to it, the general tone and comments throughout the post suggest you would have been rude anyway)", "NTA. Your father is being really weird. Yes, you occasionally need to suck it up and act polite at a family dinner, and maybe you need to get better at that, but the time for it isn't a late evening when you've just been first lied to and then forced to attend.", "NTA.\n\nThis is outrageous bullshit on your father's part.\n\nImagine for a minute this wasn't a father/child relationship, imagine this was a couple. Imagine someone promised their partner that there was just going to be a quick \"hi and bye\" call in on someone, and then sprang it on them when they arrived that in fact it was going to be a whole evening deal with relatives they don't like. We'd be screaming for that guy's hide.\n\nBut somehow, when it's your parent, there's this expectation that you have to take this nonsense lying down, and if you don't take this imposition on your free time, and look happy about it while you're about it, somehow you're childish and unreasonable.\n\nAbsolutely on your side about this.", "You want me to tell you that you're not an obnoxious teenage ah?

Now im going to assume yiur behaviour is partly due to some classic teenage angst. But its still from my perspective rude and unacceptable behaviour from a 15 year old. It probably wouldn't have killed you to suck up your own feelings for the night, put on a smile and just try to be an engaging member of the family.  I get you were annoyed, but is that the hill you want to die on? Yes he lied to you, but was it anything major? No. Maybe he wanted to spend time with you? Maybe he wanted you to build a better relationship with your family. \n\nAs far as the tiredness goes - wait until you have a job, like your dad probably does. Do you think perhaps maybe he was tired from working all week, being nearly 60, and having a recalcitrant son that makes his life unnecessarily difficult - maybe that was the reason for getting mad at you. \n\nAs part of growing older and growing into a functional member of society you'll sometimes need to do things you don't want to do, with people you don't want to do it with.

I'm sorry you feel out of place, but maybe some of your cousins will talk with you if you try.  Ask them questions, talk about your interests, maybe they will have similar interests.  Of course, it might also be one of those situations where, as the youngest, you get talked over and are expected to just sit there quietly until the adults notice you and ask you questions.

From what you wrote, it seems like your father was being deceptive and trying to force you into a social situation you weren't ready for. You handled it in a kinda typical teen manner. Your father should communicate with you more and model positive social strategies (and not lying to your family) and help you and your cousins brainstorm ways to improve your relationships. It's obvious he knows where things stand and this seemed like a super clumsy way to try to fix things. He should have been honest and talked to you about agreeing to visit family and negotiated terms if you weren't ready.\n\nOn the other hand, you definitely were acting sulky. You're 15 years old. You need to learn to socialize with more people and make an effort with your family. Maybe talk with a counselor about developing social skills. This whole discussion sounds a bit autistic to me. That you're struggling to handle disruptions to your routine or talking to new people. And the fact that there was so much discussion about plans before going. But I think you should have at least made an effort to sit at the table and pick at some of the food a bit. Maybe only for 15 minutes or something.\n\nI think you can go to your father and say that you're sorry for how you acted, but you were really tired and didn't feel up to trying to get to know your cousins that night but that you'd appreciate it if he could warn you and not force you into uncomfortable social situations. If he wants you to get along better with family, he needs to let you know more in advance when you're going to see them and negotiate a maximum frequency (say once a month?).

The problem is about the dad *lying* and *manipulating* him to corner him and force him to go, which apparently some think is perfectly fine", "Sigh just enough. Op acted like an adult. He communicated he was tired and didn't want to go. But compromised when dad promised it wouldn't be long and wouldn't have to go in. Instead dad broke his promised and threw a fit when his son expressed his boundaries and stood by them. Stop expecting kids to just fall in line and do what their told. They have thoughts and feeling and have reasons for doing what they do. Forcing them to do something just because you are an adult and say so is abuse. Respect children. \n\nIf op was an adult this wouldn't even be a problem. 9 pm is to late be having a dinner for any adult with a job in the morning. I'm in bed by nine and have to be up at 5. Op as school and is a kid. They need more sleep then an adult. I can't believe how much your calling op a child when their trying to be responsible and go to bed at a reasonable time for them. They left at 11. I would be so pissed if someone made me stay that late after promising it would be quick. I don't understand how you don't see thats wrong.", ">At no point does OP actually say her\\* dad lied.\n\n\\*his", "So everything you do in life is preplanned and never deviates from that plan at short notice?", "There is a difference between a gf and a child. Kids can\u2019t decide to stay home alone whenever they want. So sometimes they have to come with regardless if they want or not. A minors feeling are not unimportant, but parents are not required to organize their life around their kids feeling. What is your solution? They are not allowed to visit family because their son is bored there? Raise a couple teenagers and come back to me. You are absolutely clueless.", "If my deviation hurts someone I made a promise to, I Apologize, not blame them for being upset. That is called being a responsible adult", "And part of being nearly a grown man is that when things don't go your way, especially when they are relatively benign, you put on a brave face and give a concerted effort anyways.\n\nEdit: also how was OP hurt? Midly inconvenienced at best.", "Have you seriously never been made to stay up three hours past when you were already exhausted? I would bet you get uglier then op did. Op was just withdrawn"]}
