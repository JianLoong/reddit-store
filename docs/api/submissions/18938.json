I don't really like family dinners/get-togethers since I feel really bored' uncomfortable' and out of place there and there aren't really people to chat with so I mostly study or go through my phone)\n\nSo yesterday my father told me that we're paying my aunt a visit(not entering the house, just a visit by their door). He asked me if I would have a problem if there's going to be any guests at my aunt's house(by guests he means my cousins). I said yes (because I don't really like most of my cousins because there's a huge age gap between us and I can't really talk to anyone). He said ok and we went at 8 P.M. I usually sleep super early so I slept at the car.\n\nNext thing that I know, my father wakes me up and tells me to get out of the car. He told me that we're invited to a dinner and most of my cousin's are invited aswell. I got upset since not only my father didn't tell me that there are guests at my aunt's house, I clearly told him that I wouldn't visit if there's going to be guests. He told me that I shouldn't be acting so immature . we had a mini-argument at the car but at the end we got out of the car and went to my aunt's house.\n\nI was so sleepy and it was obvious from my eyes. I only said hello to people that greeted me first(and, y'know, acknowledged my existence). then sat at a corner and went through my phone(cause I had nothing better to do lol). I refused to sit at the dinner table cause I wasn't hungry and I was kinda sleepy. My father kept side-eyeing me on the table with an angry expression on his face. We left at 11 P.M. my father got so mad at me and told me I should grow up and, be more social, and me not sitting on the table was extremely impolite. he refuses to talk to me for now.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685869950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14077e6/aita_for_acting_immature_at_a_family_dinner/", "score": 301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA\n\nLearn to get along with people of different ages.  It will serve you well in life. You're a brat. Which is age-appropriate, we understand and forgive you,  but it is something you need to get over. However, it IS hard to connect with people. So you need ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some ideas to connect with people:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Find out if any of your elderly relatives like word games. Show them how to play Ruzzle, or Wordle/Quordle/Octordle on their phones or yours.\n* Ask the host/ess if they need any help. Help set the table or stir something. This will win you MASSIVE points.\n* Play with the littles. If they are between 1-3 they probably like bouncy games where you bounce them on your knee. Older than that and you can play Bear, where you growl at them and chase them around. Make sure there's a base they can get away from you. And keep in mind little kids like to make up rules in their favor as they go along.\n* Or ask the host/ess if you and the littles can build a fort out of patio furniture or couch cushions. Those kids will love you forever.\n* When someone asks you what you are studying or other boring questions old people ask you because they have no idea what to talk to you about, answer their question and then turn it around and ask them what THEIR favorite subject was, or about their youth in general. Ask them how they wore their hair in the 80s. In general, most people looove talking about themselves so if you get them to talk about themselves they will think you are charming.(Obviously don't do this to someone who is super shy)\n* People also like to be made to feel important, so asking for advice with problems will make them feel like you think they are smart.\n* Everyone has a crazy story in them. Try to find out what it is.\n* Bring a board game or cards and ask people to join you. Gamble peanuts or something.\n\nIf you develop a halfway decent relationship with just a few of these people, these sorts of events will be MUCH less tedious and a lot more fun.", "YTA like sure typical teenager behavior we are talking here about.

That's a sign there's underlying health issues so best to get checked out, even if the diagnosis is clear.", "ESH. Your dad should have been upfront about the situation. You should have shown some basic manners (although I can appreciate its horrible having to socialise when not necessarily feeling up to it, the general tone and comments throughout the post suggest you would have been rude anyway)", "NTA. Your father is being really weird. Yes, you occasionally need to suck it up and act polite at a family dinner, and maybe you need to get better at that, but the time for it isn't a late evening when you've just been first lied to and then forced to attend.", "NTA.\n\nThis is outrageous bullshit on your father's part.\n\nImagine for a minute this wasn't a father/child relationship, imagine this was a couple. Imagine someone promised their partner that there was just going to be a quick \"hi and bye\" call in on someone, and then sprang it on them when they arrived that in fact it was going to be a whole evening deal with relatives they don't like. We'd be screaming for that guy's hide.\n\nBut somehow, when it's your parent, there's this expectation that you have to take this nonsense lying down, and if you don't take this imposition on your free time, and look happy about it while you're about it, somehow you're childish and unreasonable.\n\nAbsolutely on your side about this.", "You want me to tell you that you're not an obnoxious teenage ah?

Now im going to assume yiur behaviour is partly due to some classic teenage angst. But its still from my perspective rude and unacceptable behaviour from a 15 year old. It probably wouldn't have killed you to suck up your own feelings for the night, put on a smile and just try to be an engaging member of the family.  I get you were annoyed, but is that the hill you want to die on? Yes he lied to you, but was it anything major? No. Maybe he wanted to spend time with you? Maybe he wanted you to build a better relationship with your family. \n\nAs far as the tiredness goes - wait until you have a job, like your dad probably does. Do you think perhaps maybe he was tired from working all week, being nearly 60, and having a recalcitrant son that makes his life unnecessarily difficult - maybe that was the reason for getting mad at you. \n\nAs part of growing older and growing into a functional member of society you'll sometimes need to do things you don't want to do, with people you don't want to do it with.

Just be straight up with the kid!", "He still lied about his intentions", "Why would he sit at the table if he didn't plan to eat?", "Generally speaking yeah sure there\u2019s some parents that love exerting their power over children but in this situation it\u2019s not abusive to want your kid to socialise. \n\nI do empathise with the lad as I remember being dragged round here there and everywhere to see family when I was younger, but we all have to do things we don\u2019t like from time to time, I learned that it\u2019s easier to fake a smile and polite conversation than to argue with your parents every step of the way.", "I would be actually fully able to act like a normal polite person in the above situation. Because, I do understand plans, human relationships, I am not autistic and I don't think the whole world centers around me.\n\nSorry, but yelling \"lie\" because plans changed and now you have to *gasp* survive in the same room as people who are not your best friends (but never harmed you) is literally definition of immaturity.", "Right. \"Do as I say\" ok boomer. Kids HAVE to do EVERYTHING their parents say with a smile regardless of how they feel or the boundaries they've set.... Makes sense, they're not people after all, they're children. You're actually gross", "That's what I mean he seemed very unsure if he was welcome.   Probably was happy to be asked in and then the kid acts rude as heck.  It's a shame that they don't communicate better.  Kid sounds pretty mean as well.", "I disagree, this is pretty abusive. The kid was *lied* to. He was told this was a flying visit, and *presumably* had plans for the evening of his own. Then all of a sudden his dad switches plans, gives him absolutely no say in it, and has the absolute *gall* to be mad at the kid for the way he handles the situation. What the kid wants has been completely disregarded at all stages of this event. It\u2019s not even as if the kid was actively rude to anyone. He spoke when he was spoken to, and otherwise sat in the corner and scrolled his phone until it was time to go home. \n\nIf I was forced to impose something like this on anyone, I wouldn\u2019t comment on how they accommodated me, and I would apologise for having put them in a spot. People are being very strong on how the parent has the authority in this situation, and that\u2019s true. But the point about *having* this kind of authority is to use it responsibly and consider the feelings of those over whom you have authority. Not to disregard their feelings because you have the power to do so.", "The dramtics are hilarious.\n\nThe issue with this situation is that the dad never set expectations. If they want their kid to play nice for a few hours then they should help create an environment where the kid can enjoy that experience. \n\nParents are supposed to be leaders. But just kicking the kid to the wolves without any direction or guidence? Or in this suiation promising one thing just to switch it up? That is bad parenting. That is bad leadership. So the dad can't rightfully gripe abut their son making them \"look bad\". They made themslves look bad by forcing this on their kid without preperation.", "How it is rude to reiterate a boundary that was set early on? You're wrong and so was the dad. If he went there hoping to be invited in he could've let his kid stay home instead of being a manipulative dick"]}
