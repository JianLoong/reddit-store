They both say they\u2019re present since they work from home.

(My other aunt, uncle, and cousins who I live with were out of town, by the way. That\u2019s why they asked me.)\n\nI immediately told them no and refused to even think about it.

They haven't curbed Michelle's behavior, so he's reacting in a way that protects himself. \n\nFor example, let's say A and B made plans for dinner at a restaurant at 5 even though A is chronically late. A messages B last minute saying they won't get there until 7:30, but B is already there. B decides to leave or eat there alone bc they're hungry and don't want to wait 2 and a half hours doing nothing while they're hungry. Do you think A has the right to tell B they're disappointed when it was *their* actions that caused B to make new plans? \n\n> I don't think you have a right to tell people they don't get to feel their feelings.\n\nThere's a difference between having the right to your feelings and misdirecting those feelings at the wrong person. The parents can be disappointed all they want-no one can control how they feel-but they should be disappointed in themselves, not OP. They're the ones who have not fixed the situation with Michelle. They're the ones who have a child that is striaght up a *threat* to whoever watches her and manages to upset her. They're the ones who are expecting ppl to risk having serious, life-threatening allegations made about them bc they can't manage Michelle's behavior. \n\nKnowing Michelle can and will accuse ppl of awful, things, they're the ones responsible for making a plan that protects whoever they ask to watch her.

People get to feel feelings, especially in times of crisis (which honestly is why your example isn't a good one, because this wasn't just any other day, this was an emergency which is the only reason they even asked.) They didn't push OP to do anything he wasn't comfortable with, they asked, he said no, they moved on. They only let him know they were disappointed after the fact, with no attempt to make him do the thing he refused to do, just to let him know how his actions made them feel.

The issue is not that the parents are disappointed, but that they are *directing that disappointment at the wrong person.* THEIR actions caused OP (and likely a lot of other family and friends) to, rightfully, be disinclined to babysit their daughter. It really doesn't matter that it was an emergency-that's not going to stop Michelle from making a serious allegation against OP. If they want to avoid this issue, they need to be more proactive in discouraging Michelle. She should not be making multiple allegatioms about ppl that have to be investigated. They are solely responsible for others' reactions to her daughter. \n\nGreat, they didn't push OP in the moment. That doesn't excuse their message to him, especially since they were clearly trying to make him feel guilty by mentioning the time they took off work and stress *he* caused. They may as well have told him they're disappointed he didn't risk his livelihood, reputation, and who knows what else by watching their daughter alone for who knows how long, bc that's pretty much what they mean when they say they're disappointed in him not babysitting her. Which, yeah, *is* an asshole thing to tell someone. Imagine telling someone how dare they care about their personal safety and being disappointed in them for setting boundaries to prevent getting accused of assault or some other serious charge. \n\nImagine being disappointed at the family member who was proactive about protecting themselves from an allegation that would ruin their life instead of at yourself for not doing something about the daughter who is actually making those allegations.", "I never said \"instead of\" anything, not sure where you got that.", "You have no idea what they've done for/\"about\" their daughter and neither does OP. \n\nImagine telling someone you're disappointed that they let your kid drown instead of trying to help.

And maybe this is a very unfortunate situation in which they are trying their best but Michelle is just resistent to all forms of discipline/therapy/etc, but then they need to take the correct precautions, and that includes making a plan for any potential babysitters that protects them in case Michelle lies. I already suggested putting cameras in their house to provide as evidence in case Michelle lies about someone watching her. Maybe they can come up with a better solution, but that is their responsibility as parents. It is not fair to put that onus on someone else when they'd be the one risking everything should Michelle accuse them of something awful. \n\n>Imagine telling someone you're disappointed that they let your kid drown instead of trying to help.

Does that sound sane and reasonable to you? \n\n>If you make a decision and it impacts someone else, be prepared for them to let you know.\n\nOr they can act like responsible, reasonable adults and not guilt trip someone who decided to put their safety first.
