Wishing their victim would do something stupid and dangerous to themselves does not make it a reasonable expectation.", "Exactly what I was thinking \ud83e\udd23", "Why can\u2019t you just leave the wolf with the grain after the first trip? Go back, get the chicken, done.", "That parents aren\u2019t very smart.", "Because they needed help? Hope you never need help.", "I messed up the puzzle lol. The boat's supposed to only fit 1 thing at a time. So the right solution is chicken first by itself, then etc.", "Because in the puzzle they're referencing part of the set up is the boat/whatever you're in only has enough space for you and one object, so you can only bring one thing over at a time.", "They botched that riddle. You can only take one across at a time, so you take the chicken first, then the grain, take the chicken back, take the wolf over, then come back for the chicken.", "She might have already threatened to", "She should have got expelled for that, she almost ruined that man\u2019s life. You could use that as an example as why you won\u2019t babysit for her.", "So what were the repercussions? As u/No_Bodybuilder8055 noted, this was an expel-level offense.", "OMG, your post alone makes you NTA, but this? Yea, 100%. How are her parents surprised people don't want to be left alone with her when this is the type of kid she is? She could've ruined her coach's life over a bad grade. I know in situations like this, people always want to find a deeper reason, but honestly, she just sounds like an awful kid, and **you should definitely continue to stay away from her.**", ">That's reasonable and proper adult communication.\n\nIt really isn't. There is nothing constructive that can come out of their condescending, manipulative message. And MAKE NO MISTAKE, that is exactly what the message was. Otherwise, they would have kept their \"disappointment\" to themselves.\n\nBeing upfront with feelings isn't always productive. Case in point: It would be valid if OP felt discomfort about them being terrible parents and suspicion that they are sexually abusing her leading to her odd behaviour. Per your logic, they should just smile and acknowledge it if OP shared these feelings with them?", ">Where did I say anyone should be forced to do anything?\n\nPoor choice of words on my part, I probably should have said no one should be expected-or, frankly, even asked-to take that risk. \n\n>All I said was that if someone's actions make you feel disappointed that doesn't make you an asshole to let them know.\n\nBut OP is basing his actions on theirs. They haven't curbed Michelle's behavior, so he's reacting in a way that protects himself. \n\nFor example, let's say A and B made plans for dinner at a restaurant at 5 even though A is chronically late. A messages B last minute saying they won't get there until 7:30, but B is already there. B decides to leave or eat there alone bc they're hungry and don't want to wait 2 and a half hours doing nothing while they're hungry. Do you think A has the right to tell B they're disappointed when it was *their* actions that caused B to make new plans? \n\n> I don't think you have a right to tell people they don't get to feel their feelings.\n\nThere's a difference between having the right to your feelings and misdirecting those feelings at the wrong person. The parents can be disappointed all they want-no one can control how they feel-but they should be disappointed in themselves, not OP. They're the ones who have not fixed the situation with Michelle. They're the ones who have a child that is striaght up a *threat* to whoever watches her and manages to upset her. They're the ones who are expecting ppl to risk having serious, life-threatening allegations made about them bc they can't manage Michelle's behavior. \n\nKnowing Michelle can and will accuse ppl of awful, things, they're the ones responsible for making a plan that protects whoever they ask to watch her. Maybe that means installing cameras in their house so they can prove that Michelle is lying, but that's on them to figure out instead.", "Oooooooo that makes more sense. I read this a bunch of times convinced I was missing something \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The need had passed by the time they said that to him, so obviously they took his no. They weren't fishing for a year because there was nothing to say yes to. They no longer needed anyone to watch the kid.", "I never said OP shouldn't get to feel his feelings about being told he disappointed them. Where did you get the idea that I thought OP has to smile and nod when they say they're disappointed? If their disappointment causes OP to feel some kind of way and he feels like he needs to express that to them, I don't think he'd be an asshole if he did. \n\nI think that if OP actually suspects her parents are abusing her then he'd be an asshole to keep it to himself!!! What even are you saying!?! Of course he should express that if he actually believes it!", "I absolutely think A has the right to feel feelings, and tell B about their feelings. For sure. And if that makes B upset and wants to let A know about how their lateness impacted them, I think that's ok too. People get to feel feelings, especially in times of crisis (which honestly is why your example isn't a good one, because this wasn't just any other day, this was an emergency which is the only reason they even asked.) They didn't push OP to do anything he wasn't comfortable with, they asked, he said no, they moved on. They only let him know they were disappointed after the fact, with no attempt to make him do the thing he refused to do, just to let him know how his actions made them feel. And if he feels like he has to explain why he did what he did and how their decisions around their kid affect him, I don't think that'd make him an AH either.", ">Of course he should express that if he actually believes it!\n\nOf course he should express it to them in the spirit of \"being open about feelings\" instead of to the authorities?\n\n>If their disappointment causes OP to feel some kind of way and he feels like he needs to express that to them\n\nYou are describing the formula for escalating into a full-blown fight. The same end result of both parties going no contact could have been achieved if the aunt and uncle had just kept their mouths shut from the start.", "I'm not sure why you're struggling to understand. The issue is not that the parents are disappointed, but that they are *directing that disappointment at the wrong person.* THEIR actions caused OP (and likely a lot of other family and friends) to, rightfully, be disinclined to babysit their daughter. It really doesn't matter that it was an emergency-that's not going to stop Michelle from making a serious allegation against OP. If they want to avoid this issue, they need to be more proactive in discouraging Michelle. She should not be making multiple allegatioms about ppl that have to be investigated. They are solely responsible for others' reactions to her daughter. \n\nGreat, they didn't push OP in the moment. That doesn't excuse their message to him, especially since they were clearly trying to make him feel guilty by mentioning the time they took off work and stress *he* caused. They may as well have told him they're disappointed he didn't risk his livelihood, reputation, and who knows what else by watching their daughter alone for who knows how long, bc that's pretty much what they mean when they say they're disappointed in him not babysitting her. Which, yeah, *is* an asshole thing to tell someone. Imagine telling someone how dare they care about their personal safety and being disappointed in them for setting boundaries to prevent getting accused of assault or some other serious charge. \n\nImagine being disappointed at the family member who was proactive about protecting themselves from an allegation that would ruin their life instead of at yourself for not doing something about the daughter who is actually making those allegations.", "I never said \"instead of\" anything, not sure where you got that.", "You have no idea what they've done for/\"about\" their daughter and neither does OP. \n\nImagine telling someone you're disappointed that they let your kid drown instead of trying to help. You think that's wrong? That makes you an asshole? Yeah they had reason to not help, but you wish they would have because you really needed someone to help.\n\n If you make a decision and it impacts someone else, be prepared for them to let you know. That applies to OP and his aunt and uncle both. If OP wants to let them know how their actions make him feel, he should do it.", "\"Together with\", \"concurrent to\", \"after\", \"before\"... All terrible ideas! \n\nIn this case, following the witless platitude\"always express yourself\" blindly will only give potential abusers the heads up to cover their tracks.", ">You have no idea what they've done for/\"about\" their daughter and neither does OP. \n\nI know that whatever they have or haven't done isn't enough, bc she's still making accusations. And maybe this is a very unfortunate situation in which they are trying their best but Michelle is just resistent to all forms of discipline/therapy/etc, but then they need to take the correct precautions, and that includes making a plan for any potential babysitters that protects them in case Michelle lies. I already suggested putting cameras in their house to provide as evidence in case Michelle lies about someone watching her. Maybe they can come up with a better solution, but that is their responsibility as parents. It is not fair to put that onus on someone else when they'd be the one risking everything should Michelle accuse them of something awful. \n\n>Imagine telling someone you're disappointed that they let your kid drown instead of trying to help. You think that's wrong?\n\nAre you seriously comparing refusing to save a drowning kid to refusing to babysit a kid? Does that sound sane and reasonable to you? \n\n>If you make a decision and it impacts someone else, be prepared for them to let you know.\n\nOr they can act like responsible, reasonable adults and not guilt trip someone who decided to put their safety first. It was their irresponsibility in failing to come up with a safety measure for potential babysitters which resulted in them asking OP to risk everything to watch their kid. And, sorry not sorry, but asking someone to potentially face an assault charge (or worse) is unequivocally an asshole thing to do."]}
