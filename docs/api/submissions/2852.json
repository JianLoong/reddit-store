Her house, her rules.\n\nBut it's also not good to set up a different standard for behavior and consequences at each house. That undermines both of your approaches to parenting. \n\nAt one house, Haley has strict consequences for her actions. Your parenting style seems to be more guidance focused. Both can work, depending on the child in question's personality, but not when these approaches are working against each other as they seem to be here.\n\nYour ex should have gotten your input on a punishment that would bleed into your custody time. You should have had that conversation with your ex and left Haley out of it. It's this thing called \"co-parenting\" and you two don't seem to be good at it.

However, as other posters have noted, trying to be the fun parent is shitty and a recipe for disaster. \n\nOverall, if I was you, I would be of the opinion that the punishment didn\u2019t fit the crime. If the dishes pile up, you don\u2019t ground the kid, you make them do the dishes. If the kid is napping when you think they should be working, you wake them up and tell them to get on with the chores, or let them sleep and make sure they complete the chores before they go out or whatever. \n\nI\u2019m going for a gentle YTA because you need to get on the same page as your ex. Maybe next time, when she tells you what you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to do vis a vis one of your kids, push back right then. Ask questions. Express your concerns or disagreement.

It's hard to do but inconsistency can be detrimental to the kids.\n\nYou guys need to communicate better on co-parenting and that includes doling out punishment.", "YTA. \n\nBy not punishing your children you are creating a toxic situation between the two households they are a part of. They will start to vilify your wife which will lead to more problems. \n\nIf you had actually enforced the punishment you might have actually been able to spend more time with your daughter instead of her being focused on her electronics the entire weekend.", "YTA you want to be her friend so bad you forgot to be her parent", "Should've continuted to hold her accountable, it's inconsistent parenting.

Or is it just because it would be easier for you to deal with?", "NTA, your ex decided on behalf of both of you that your daughter has to be punished and what the punishment is. That's OK in her place, but she shouldn't expect you to follow with the punishment.\n\nYou don't have that much time with your daughter and your ex's punishment shouldn't interrupt your time and plans. \n\nIt would be different if she did something bad like smoking or drugs. Then it would make sense for you to two to come up with a joint punishment for both households. \n\nDishes, taking naps or talking to her boyfriend are pretty minor issues.

You two need to work together.  Neither parent should be punishing or ending punishments unilaterally.", "YTA I can't believe a parent even has to ask this. Obviously, if you let your child play one parent off against the other, they are going to learn to get their way by convincing the lenient parent to ease off. Your weekend wouldn't have been \"hindered\" by punishments. She probably would have wanted more attention since she didn't have her usual amusements so you might have actually had an opportunity to spend time with her. What you really didn't want was being seen as \"the bad guy.\"  Sorry bud, but a good parent does have to be the bad guy from time to time. Your job is to teach your daughter to function as an adult, not be her best friend on weekends. She already has friends. She needs a father.", "YTA. Consistency matters when children go back and forth between household. There are consequences for bad behavior, and those really do need to be upheld.\n\nWhen our boys got in trouble at their mom's house, she would tell us what was going on, and we stick with her plan. The same thing if they got in trouble at our house - we'd fill her in and she'd follow through. That's how COparenting works \n\nYou just taught your kid that coming over to your house is her \"get out of jail free\" card, and that, sir is a bad thing. It's VERY common for kids to start acting up at \"mom's\" house because \"dad let's me do what I want\". (Swap parents as necessary.) This leads to a lot of extra tension between EVERYONE that didn't have to happen if people just got on the same page.\n\nYou ARE undermining your XW parenting by showing your daughter that what mom says doesn't mean anything.\n\nYTA, most definitely.", "NTA.

Your kids are old enough where childcare during work hours shouldn't be needed. Maybe you'd be more confident in being a parent if you had more time instead of just being 'weekend fun parent'. \n\nMy advice is to put ex on dnd and tell her to stay in her lane when it's your parenting time. Should have done that years ago. She has no business telling you how to parent. I'm sure she wouldn't be receptive if you did the same to her during her time.\n\nLook up parallel parenting. It's actuality a better way to co-parent and each parent isn't just able to over rule the other. Just because you have kids together doesn't mean you have to always have the same rules and punishments. With this way, you can raise your kids how you see fit and she can do the same at her house. It's less conflict this way, too.", "NTA. For the best coparenting, you and your ex should really be on the same page when it comes to punishment and all that, but none of those offenses really seem to warrant grounding.

I do think co-parenting is exactly that, but your ex partner doesn't get to designate their punishment for what happened at their home on your time without your agreement. You went through everything that happened and worked through it with her while still sitting boundaries. She agreed where she went wrong and promise to do better, I think that's excellent parenting. Children need an environment to prosper and as long as she follows through with better actions I see no problems.", "YTA. You want to be the fun parent.

She could have easily said \"No laptop til Saturday\" and avoided bringing you into it at all. She doesn't get to make sweeping punishments, and you don't get to sweep them under the rug. You need to communicate better.\n\nThough it does make me question why your daughter is getting punished for *napping* and simply waiting to do dishes, while your son has no punishments. He could just as easily been doing dishes, and no one deserves to be punished for taking a nap. \n\nThe phone thing, I understand. Don't wake everyone up with 1am calls from BF.", "NTA. If your ex is giving a punishment that she wants extended to your time it needs to be discussed first and agreed upon. If not, she needs to just decide what days the punishment goes through at her house or have a consequence that does not have a time limit. For example,  if you don't do the dishes, you're responsible for them the next 3 nights at mom's house. For little infractions it shouldn't impede on the others' parenting time. For big things like a school suspension, I would expect both parents to talk through an appropriate consequence.", "NTA and I also need to know what chores her younger brother does. \n\nEdit: what a relief that OP confirmed the son does equal chores.\n\nWow! Thanks for the downvotes for asking a question!", "NTA. 16 year olds can be reasonable.

Definitely by age 16 my kids didn\u2019t need punishments. It just seemed so ridiculous to punish. If they are struggling with procrastination, you problem solve that. If they need more sleep you let them nap. If they are inconsiderate about phone calls you discuss it.\n\nTeens get so animated late at night. That is totally normal. It\u2019s pretty normal to want to talk to a friend or boyfriend late at night.\n\nNone of these things seem like they need over the tops punishments. You can ask the kid to be more considerate. Ask their input on solutions on how to not procrastinate.\n\nI am happy with how my four teens/young adults have turned out so far. I have good relationships with them because I listened to them and respected them. We never had any big issues (introverted kids, good students, etc.). \n\nI just think that teenagers are usually stressed. They need love and support.
