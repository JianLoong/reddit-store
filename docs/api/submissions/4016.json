Nik told them I was Greek (as he was Greek and my mums side is) and they reacted by trying to ask me things in Greek, it was overwhelming at first.\n\nI respectfully let them know I am not familiar with my mums side BUT I am always willing to learn. Although disappointed, they all understood. To impress them however, I learnt the language enough to have small conversations, learnt how to cook the food they showed me and just celebrated them like they were my own blood family.\n\nUntil a question got raised one day, WHERE my parents were and who raised me. Not going into it but they were not happy AT ALL with the small information I gave them. After that I was treated TERRIBLY, any attempts at Greek they laughed at but if I stopped learning then they could talk about me in front of my face, which they frequently did expecting me not to understand until I did understand. They called me disgusting nicknames and even blamed me for things that I didn\u2019t even do! I was the punching bag and although at first Nik didn\u2019t do anything to help, he soon started stepping up for me! All this was instigated by Thea who is the most narcissistic person you could meet, very like Instagram fake and two faced. Another couple years go by with this bullying and his mum realised that either she joined them in bullying me or she would lose her son. She really buckled down when I had my first son Atticus and though she didn\u2019t stick up for me, she also didn\u2019t join in with them anymore. \n\nSo one day Niks cousin brings home a girl, lovely girl, now this cousin is queen bee Thea\u2019s kid and she was showered in attention and love. She isn\u2019t Greek but they didn\u2019t mind, months go by and they try teaching her some Greek and it was all going well until she also shared that she went through the same state system as me! I was so worried for her but they all just smiled and laughed and said that \u201cwe\u2019re you\u2019re family now\u201d.\n\nSomething in me snapped.\n\nI had to excuse myself, with a smile on my face and sat out the front until my husband caught on and we left. We live in the same street as my MIL so she followed us home soon after and went to have a little go at me for leaving without giving yiayia a kiss goodbye.\n\nI\u2019m a very calm and patient person normally and I went OFF. I brutally unleashed on her 10 years of rage and didn\u2019t hold back! \n\nMy husband told his mum to go home and then told me I am an asshole for blowing up at her because I am jealous of Jacobs Girlfriend. \n\nI do feel bad.. but I had put up with so much.. I\u2019m not sure anymore - am I the asshole for yelling 10 years worth of repressed rage at my MIL?", "created_utc": 1670253005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd9cec/aita_for_exploding_10_years_of_repressed_rage_at/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe that wasn't the most appropriate way to do it, but your In-Laws had it coming for being so racist/nasty to you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKinda weird that your husband doesn't understand where your reaction is coming from.", "NTA - They spent 10 years abusing you and now they are unhappy because they have installed a new \"golden\" child and you don't appreciate the obvious favoritism?  Your husband is a AH for continuing to be his mom's flying monkey in this situation and you might want to do a bit of reading on the \"sunk costs\" fallacy as you evaluate your relationship with him.  This is a toxic situation and it's never going to get any better unless he grows a pair and that doesn't seem likely.  Please be good to yourself and think very hard about the situation.", "NTA you tolerate them why? If you say because he's wooooorth it I'll vomit. No man worth a damn will make his wife go anywhere near that cesspool. Just stop going. Sure you may get a divorce but being married to someone who likes you is infinitely better.", "NTA and good for you. How did it feel to let her have it?", "NTA you were very mature. I hope your husband understands you, that's the least he can do.", "NTA she hasn\u2019t stuck up for you and the girl is magically accepted yet you aren\u2019t. That\u2019s horrible and you don\u2019t deserve it", "> I am an asshole for blowing up at her because I am jealous of Jacobs Girlfriend.\n\nOBVS you're going to be jealous of the other woman in the family who has a similar background to yours but still gets better treated than, better accepted than you and considered \"family now\", especially given that you're MARRIED into the family and she's not. Even moreso that they never let down on the bad treatment they inflict on you, so it's not a matter of \"they were shocked at first when I gave them the info, but they warmed up to me and it benefitted the newcoming gf\". It's a completely unexplained double standard. It does not mean that you're ~~not~~ wrong to be jealous (even if jealousy has a bad rep). Why are you supposed to just be OK with the whole situation?\n\nYou accepted being mistreated by your in-laws for years (why?) and undefended and unsupported by your husband for a while (why?). Then you witness newbie gf getting all sorts of \"this fine, you family now\". \n\nWhy is your husband emotionally aware enough to understand that you left the room to seethe alone, but not enough to understand why you would lash at your MIL, is less about him not understanding why you're jealous and more about him not wanting you to make a scene. \n\nI don't know but, to me, if your husband and MIL don't get it, they might never will get it. \n\nAnyway, in this scene, you were hurt for a decade, decided to remove yourself from the situation and got harrassed on the way home for not exiting the scene while performing all the good-bye obligations/traditions. It's a classic case of delayed \"fucked around and found out\". NTA.\n\nAsk your husband what kind of reaction you should have had that was both **fair to you** (insist on it) and fair on the people who inflicted bad in-laws treatment. Bet he can't find a \"compromise\" of how it should have gone better for his ~~better~~ MIL and would have allowed you to get the point across of how unfairly you have been treated. If can't find a \"compromise\" of how you should have kept peace, he can shut up.\n\nEDIT : Typos.", "NTA I bet it was cathartic. It's bullshit that you aren't getting treated equally but at least they know that you won't be a doormat", "Info: So from my understanding of the situation they had some old school classist attitude toward you because your family was originally from the \u201cthe wrong part\u201d of Greece? Like an Northern Italian mocking someone from Naples?", "NTA.

You may be TA for your delivery, but I can't blame you. You must be tough to have repressed it for that long!", "NTA you have every right to be angry at this behavior it\u2019s unjust and it\u2019s uncalled for. They\u2019re bullying toxic assholes and your husband should\u2019ve stood up for you he should\u2019ve stopped this immediately. You have an so  problem.", "NTA  The witch, MIL, totally deserved it.", "NTA. You left and went home without making a scene. Said person follows you home to berate you in your own home. She received every bit you gave her. A cornered animal/person will lash out when trapped. Your husband needs to support his immediate family of his wife and child more. I wish you luck in going forward.", "NTA but your husband has been tolerating this from his family this whole time. That\u2019s not a way I would ever treat someone I love and respect.", "NTA You handled yourself very well after so many years of tolerating unacceptable behaviour. You should be proud of yourself and hopefully your family will see the error of their ways and attempt to make amends and treat you with the respect you have always deserved.", "Sorta YTA.\n\nYour frustrations with their family seems legit, but blowing up on your MIL like that was out of line. The issue sounds like the crazy Aunt who's instigating and stirring it, and definitely some jealousy and resentment getting redirected at the wrong targets.", "ESH- You had the moral high ground until you gave it away. two wrongs don't make a right.

My husband was also a punching bag so I think he\u2019s accustomed to Theas shit (excuse my language) and has only been woken up in the past few years to her manipulative ways or he was just content being ignorant about it so he wasn\u2019t on the chopping block. For whatever reason, outside of that environment he is a great and supportive man - he just goes belly up around his family. \nI agree that jealousy does have a bad wrap and maybe I am jealous, your explanation definitely makes me believe I am and that\u2019s ok with me now I guess, so thank you for that.", "I didn\u2019t know how to feel when I did it!
