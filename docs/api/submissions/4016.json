Nik told them I was Greek (as he was Greek and my mums side is) and they reacted by trying to ask me things in Greek, it was overwhelming at first.\n\nI respectfully let them know I am not familiar with my mums side BUT I am always willing to learn. Although disappointed, they all understood. To impress them however, I learnt the language enough to have small conversations, learnt how to cook the food they showed me and just celebrated them like they were my own blood family.\n\nUntil a question got raised one day, WHERE my parents were and who raised me. Not going into it but they were not happy AT ALL with the small information I gave them. After that I was treated TERRIBLY, any attempts at Greek they laughed at but if I stopped learning then they could talk about me in front of my face, which they frequently did expecting me not to understand until I did understand. They called me disgusting nicknames and even blamed me for things that I didn\u2019t even do! I was the punching bag and although at first Nik didn\u2019t do anything to help, he soon started stepping up for me! All this was instigated by Thea who is the most narcissistic person you could meet, very like Instagram fake and two faced. Another couple years go by with this bullying and his mum realised that either she joined them in bullying me or she would lose her son. She really buckled down when I had my first son Atticus and though she didn\u2019t stick up for me, she also didn\u2019t join in with them anymore. \n\nSo one day Niks cousin brings home a girl, lovely girl, now this cousin is queen bee Thea\u2019s kid and she was showered in attention and love. She isn\u2019t Greek but they didn\u2019t mind, months go by and they try teaching her some Greek and it was all going well until she also shared that she went through the same state system as me!

We live in the same street as my MIL so she followed us home soon after and went to have a little go at me for leaving without giving yiayia a kiss goodbye.\n\nI\u2019m a very calm and patient person normally and I went OFF. I brutally unleashed on her 10 years of rage and didn\u2019t hold back! \n\nMy husband told his mum to go home and then told me I am an asshole for blowing up at her because I am jealous of Jacobs Girlfriend. \n\nI do feel bad.. but I had put up with so much..

Even moreso that they never let down on the bad treatment they inflict on you, so it's not a matter of \"they were shocked at first when I gave them the info, but they warmed up to me and it benefitted the newcoming gf\". It's a completely unexplained double standard. It does not mean that you're ~~not~~ wrong to be jealous (even if jealousy has a bad rep). Why are you supposed to just be OK with the whole situation?\n\nYou accepted being mistreated by your in-laws for years (why?) and undefended and unsupported by your husband for a while (why?). Then you witness newbie gf getting all sorts of \"this fine, you family now\". \n\nWhy is your husband emotionally aware enough to understand that you left the room to seethe alone, but not enough to understand why you would lash at your MIL, is less about him not understanding why you're jealous and more about him not wanting you to make a scene. \n\nI don't know but, to me, if your husband and MIL don't get it, they might never will get it. \n\nAnyway, in this scene, you were hurt for a decade, decided to remove yourself from the situation and got harrassed on the way home for not exiting the scene while performing all the good-bye obligations/traditions. It's a classic case of delayed \"fucked around and found out\". NTA.\n\nAsk your husband what kind of reaction you should have had that was both **fair to you** (insist on it) and fair on the people who inflicted bad in-laws treatment. Bet he can't find a \"compromise\" of how it should have gone better for his ~~better~~ MIL and would have allowed you to get the point across of how unfairly you have been treated. If can't find a \"compromise\" of how you should have kept peace, he can shut up.\n\nEDIT : Typos.", "NTA I bet it was cathartic.

It\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked on and and am getting better with, but I understand the struggle. \n\nI hope your husband steps up in this moment, he might not have realized how much you truly were struggling until this moment. If he doesn\u2019t support you and your needs (and frankly his child\u2019s family future) then maybe it is time to re-evaluate no matter how hard that is. Best of luck OP!", "Your husband is pissed that you're jealous that someone else gets treated like a human being and you get treated like \ud83d\udca9? NTA and I'm seriously questioning your husband.", "NTA.  Your husband is.  HE has allowed his family to treat you like garbage.  Your aren't jealous of the GF. You are angry they have mistreated you for something you had no control over yet they overlooked this in someone else. They have been intentionally cruel to you for years.   I think you and your husband need big time couples therapy.  I wouldn't go back over there for anything until he goes to therapy with you.", "NTA  he allowed his family to bully your for 10 years for something you had no control over.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a husband problem, not an InLaw problem. At some point, he should have made it plain that you're part of his life and if you're mistreated, they won't see you or their grandchildren. \n\nAfter having you around for 10 years, they're still mistreating you. If you remember, in the beginning, they were thrilled with you. They started to snipe later.  Give the cousin's GF a year or so and see if they're not talking about her in greek and calling her names. \n\nIt's a toxic family, not so toxic it kills you, but toxic enough that it has to attack people who marry in.", "NTA. But I\u2019m confused who Thea is and where she fits in the family? Is she MIL? If she isn\u2019t I\u2019d unleash  on her and everyone else in front of cousins girlfriend. Let her know what they really think about \u201cpeople like you\u201d - and I don\u2019t mean that as in there\u2019s actually something wrong with you, but that they\u2019ve looked down upon you and treated you like garbage because of where you come from so she can see them for what they really are. Garbage people.", "Stop telling people to leave at every problem seriously", "I was young and married a boy whose mom was always rude to me. She always made me feel like I didn't measure up. My ex pushed me to fit the culture. Made me feel like it was my fault why it was failing. Marriage ended, and it was the best freaking thing that ever happened to me. Found someone who loves and values me. Now we have a kid and a good life. You're NTA and deserve to be treated better.", "Divorce after 10 years isn't easy. But definitely the best thing I ever did!", "Agreed! The husband is a terrible partner. I can\u2019t imagine sitting back for a decade while my entire family abuses the person I supposedly love. I hope she divorces him sooner rather than later and leaves this entire horrible family in her past as she moves towards a better future.", "Comparison is the thief of joy.", "NTA but you need to go NC with his extended family for a few years and should go to marriage therapy to help you decide if you want to stay with a man who LETS his family treat his wife that way! His family will do that crap in front of your son & may treat your children as less than! Do not let that be passed down to the next generation! (& move at least a 15 minute drive away from any of his family! No reason to expose yourself to that daily!) \n\nPlease if needed go to therapy by yourself so you work on your low self esteem & why you let people treat you like crap! \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fI know it sounds weird but I think you need to write out an empowering sentence that you read out loud in front of the mirror every day. Something like \u201cI am wonderful and deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.\u201d Maybe even a second sentence \u201cI deserve a life partner who prioritizes me and will stand up for me!\u201d", "NTA", "NTA - But, you do know now that you have to learn how to better communicate instead of holding everything in\u2026.right? It\u2019s not healthy for you. I sounds like your husband may thinks you overreacted because he doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s bigger than this one incident.", "You unleashed your anger at the wrong person.  Your husband didn't shut things down and he is the biggest ahole here.  He does NOT value and respect you at all.  You really need to think about is this the life you want for next 50+ years??", "NTA. Your husband is being a jerk too", "NTA, what are these people thinking?! You need to move out of that abusive environment, with or without that husband. You can not win this war, do not even try. Run girl, run!!!", "Beautifully said."]}
