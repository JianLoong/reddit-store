Nik told them I was Greek (as he was Greek and my mums side is) and they reacted by trying to ask me things in Greek, it was overwhelming at first.\n\nI respectfully let them know I am not familiar with my mums side BUT I am always willing to learn. Although disappointed, they all understood. To impress them however, I learnt the language enough to have small conversations, learnt how to cook the food they showed me and just celebrated them like they were my own blood family.\n\nUntil a question got raised one day, WHERE my parents were and who raised me. Not going into it but they were not happy AT ALL with the small information I gave them. After that I was treated TERRIBLY, any attempts at Greek they laughed at but if I stopped learning then they could talk about me in front of my face, which they frequently did expecting me not to understand until I did understand. They called me disgusting nicknames and even blamed me for things that I didn\u2019t even do! I was the punching bag and although at first Nik didn\u2019t do anything to help, he soon started stepping up for me! All this was instigated by Thea who is the most narcissistic person you could meet, very like Instagram fake and two faced. Another couple years go by with this bullying and his mum realised that either she joined them in bullying me or she would lose her son. She really buckled down when I had my first son Atticus and though she didn\u2019t stick up for me, she also didn\u2019t join in with them anymore. \n\nSo one day Niks cousin brings home a girl, lovely girl, now this cousin is queen bee Thea\u2019s kid and she was showered in attention and love. She isn\u2019t Greek but they didn\u2019t mind, months go by and they try teaching her some Greek and it was all going well until she also shared that she went through the same state system as me!

We live in the same street as my MIL so she followed us home soon after and went to have a little go at me for leaving without giving yiayia a kiss goodbye.\n\nI\u2019m a very calm and patient person normally and I went OFF. I brutally unleashed on her 10 years of rage and didn\u2019t hold back! \n\nMy husband told his mum to go home and then told me I am an asshole for blowing up at her because I am jealous of Jacobs Girlfriend. \n\nI do feel bad.. but I had put up with so much..

Even moreso that they never let down on the bad treatment they inflict on you, so it's not a matter of \"they were shocked at first when I gave them the info, but they warmed up to me and it benefitted the newcoming gf\". It's a completely unexplained double standard. It does not mean that you're ~~not~~ wrong to be jealous (even if jealousy has a bad rep). Why are you supposed to just be OK with the whole situation?\n\nYou accepted being mistreated by your in-laws for years (why?) and undefended and unsupported by your husband for a while (why?). Then you witness newbie gf getting all sorts of \"this fine, you family now\". \n\nWhy is your husband emotionally aware enough to understand that you left the room to seethe alone, but not enough to understand why you would lash at your MIL, is less about him not understanding why you're jealous and more about him not wanting you to make a scene. \n\nI don't know but, to me, if your husband and MIL don't get it, they might never will get it. \n\nAnyway, in this scene, you were hurt for a decade, decided to remove yourself from the situation and got harrassed on the way home for not exiting the scene while performing all the good-bye obligations/traditions. It's a classic case of delayed \"fucked around and found out\". NTA.\n\nAsk your husband what kind of reaction you should have had that was both **fair to you** (insist on it) and fair on the people who inflicted bad in-laws treatment. Bet he can't find a \"compromise\" of how it should have gone better for his ~~better~~ MIL and would have allowed you to get the point across of how unfairly you have been treated. If can't find a \"compromise\" of how you should have kept peace, he can shut up.\n\nEDIT : Typos.", "NTA I bet it was cathartic.
