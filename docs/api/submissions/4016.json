Nik told them I was Greek (as he was Greek and my mums side is) and they reacted by trying to ask me things in Greek, it was overwhelming at first.\n\nI respectfully let them know I am not familiar with my mums side BUT I am always willing to learn. Although disappointed, they all understood. To impress them however, I learnt the language enough to have small conversations, learnt how to cook the food they showed me and just celebrated them like they were my own blood family.\n\nUntil a question got raised one day, WHERE my parents were and who raised me. Not going into it but they were not happy AT ALL with the small information I gave them. After that I was treated TERRIBLY, any attempts at Greek they laughed at but if I stopped learning then they could talk about me in front of my face, which they frequently did expecting me not to understand until I did understand. They called me disgusting nicknames and even blamed me for things that I didn\u2019t even do! I was the punching bag and although at first Nik didn\u2019t do anything to help, he soon started stepping up for me! All this was instigated by Thea who is the most narcissistic person you could meet, very like Instagram fake and two faced. Another couple years go by with this bullying and his mum realised that either she joined them in bullying me or she would lose her son. She really buckled down when I had my first son Atticus and though she didn\u2019t stick up for me, she also didn\u2019t join in with them anymore. \n\nSo one day Niks cousin brings home a girl, lovely girl, now this cousin is queen bee Thea\u2019s kid and she was showered in attention and love. She isn\u2019t Greek but they didn\u2019t mind, months go by and they try teaching her some Greek and it was all going well until she also shared that she went through the same state system as me!

We live in the same street as my MIL so she followed us home soon after and went to have a little go at me for leaving without giving yiayia a kiss goodbye.\n\nI\u2019m a very calm and patient person normally and I went OFF. I brutally unleashed on her 10 years of rage and didn\u2019t hold back! \n\nMy husband told his mum to go home and then told me I am an asshole for blowing up at her because I am jealous of Jacobs Girlfriend. \n\nI do feel bad.. but I had put up with so much..

Even moreso that they never let down on the bad treatment they inflict on you, so it's not a matter of \"they were shocked at first when I gave them the info, but they warmed up to me and it benefitted the newcoming gf\". It's a completely unexplained double standard. It does not mean that you're ~~not~~ wrong to be jealous (even if jealousy has a bad rep). Why are you supposed to just be OK with the whole situation?\n\nYou accepted being mistreated by your in-laws for years (why?) and undefended and unsupported by your husband for a while (why?). Then you witness newbie gf getting all sorts of \"this fine, you family now\". \n\nWhy is your husband emotionally aware enough to understand that you left the room to seethe alone, but not enough to understand why you would lash at your MIL, is less about him not understanding why you're jealous and more about him not wanting you to make a scene. \n\nI don't know but, to me, if your husband and MIL don't get it, they might never will get it. \n\nAnyway, in this scene, you were hurt for a decade, decided to remove yourself from the situation and got harrassed on the way home for not exiting the scene while performing all the good-bye obligations/traditions. It's a classic case of delayed \"fucked around and found out\". NTA.\n\nAsk your husband what kind of reaction you should have had that was both **fair to you** (insist on it) and fair on the people who inflicted bad in-laws treatment. Bet he can't find a \"compromise\" of how it should have gone better for his ~~better~~ MIL and would have allowed you to get the point across of how unfairly you have been treated. If can't find a \"compromise\" of how you should have kept peace, he can shut up.\n\nEDIT : Typos.", "NTA I bet it was cathartic.

Have you been in therapy?", "One thing to keep in mind is that you're risking that any future kids you have will go through this.", "I'm not saying that OP is in the wrong or that husband and MIL are in the right. \n\nI'm saying \"here is why I think hubby is aware enough to \"understand\" why OP left, but not enough to \"understand\" why she reacted to her MIL's taunting\".", "NTA she hasn\u2019t stuck up for you and the girl is magically accepted yet you aren\u2019t. That\u2019s horrible and you don\u2019t deserve it", "Yes, therapy has been very helpful for me.", "nope. each person takes the lead with their own family. We're talking about the approach not some actual division of marriage, FFS. If your mom is being a problem, you address her, if his mom is being a problem, he addresses HER. Like that.", "Also, when you get together with somebody, so young, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s happening right before your eyes. Now that you snapped what was acceptable to you before is no longer acceptable. That change is gonna be hard for everybody, but the best thing in the world for you good luck. NTA", "People who get together when they\u2019re kids and become intimate adults often excuse toxic behaviours because of familiarity and love. Like how people might excuse toxic traits from parents because they\u2019re family and they love them.", "NTA. You are only 27. There is so much life left to live. You deserve to be with a partner who will stand up for you, unequivocally have your back, and whose family will treat you with kindness, respect, and warmth. Letting go is incredibly hard. But the relief from freeing yourself from such mistreatment will be worth it. Good luck.", "NTA. Family sounds toxic and definitely plays favorites. Telling them off is the only way to end their toxic behavior. Probably won\u2019t change them but if they cut you out of family or go NC you haven\u2019t lost much. Let hubby deal with them.", "If this is something you want to work on you need to have this conversation with him. You need to set boundaries.. He can visit them but you and your kid stay home. You need to express an ultimatum as well with your MIL and I would suggest you both do couples counseling because if you want the relationship to survive this tyranny you both need to rise above it!", "NTA! You deserve to defend yourself, especially since it sounds like your husband is no help with his own family and has been allowing them to be hateful towards you. Maybe you didn't need to scream, but sometimes we just can't control years of pent up hurt feelings and you should forgive yourself.", "All the \u201cadvice\u201d in the comments are shit", "Soooo, don't leave us hanging! What has been the fallout?", "NTA. You were treated horribly then the add insult to injury they treat someone else of a similar background much better than you. Wash your hands with his family and tell your husband your done being mistreated when you've done nothing wrong. He can go see his family but you dont have to and if he tries to make you simply leave the room.", "NTA - what hypocrites and even the MIL realized it and didn't even offer an apology.  Your husband should have shut it down YEARS ago.", "I don't blame you for going off or for being upset. I am grateful to whatever god they serve that they have learned to not be so abusive to \"outsiders,\" though. Maybe they didn't learn? Maybe you standing up to them made them realize no one has to take their snit?\n\nHowever it happened, I'm glad they know to not mess around with your head anymore. Good for you. I don't care that my husband's sister don't adore me. I do care when they think they can treat me poorly and I'm just going to take it. Nope. Not me. You've got the wrong broad. Bite me. Each and every one of them can line up and smooch my bootay.\n\nNTA OP. No way.", "I think you two need some marriage counseling so he can see your side a bit better/at all. Also there has to be something else that they don\u2019t like about you that makes you different from this new girl. I just can\u2019t fathom any other reason they would have for being so horrible to you.", "NTA.  You recognized instantly that this new GF was going to be treated entirely differently than you've been.  Your husband knows how you've been treated and he should recognize that your experiences with his family for the past 10 years won't magically go away.  The damage is done and his family has to make an effort to correct things, it's not on you.", "NTA but your husband is. 10 years of this and he didn't shut it down? You ready to deal with it for the next 10-20-30 years?", "NTA.", "Y-T-A to yourself for putting up with it that long.  Why are you with a man that would not cut off his family once they started being mean?  Why are you with a man that blames you for being tired of abuse?", "Jeez, these people giving us (Greeks) a terrible name. NTA clearly. I am curious though, is this in Greece or are these people Greek-British or Greek-American?\n\nEdit: just saw in another comment you mention this is in Australia. These people aren\u2019t even Greek. They are just so desperate to hold on to something that makes them \u201cspecial\u201d (same with the \u201cGreek\u201d-Americans I interact with in the US.) I was born and raised in Greece, and these people have nothing in common with modern Greece. They are caricatures holding on to the past pretending to be something they aren\u2019t. Maybe tell them that next time you see them. Although I hope you don\u2019t have to spend time with them again.", "NTA", "I treated my husbands Greek family like going to jail. I gave the queen bees proverbial black eyes on the first day and they\u2019ve left me alone for going on twenty years. \n\nSweet peace\u2026 \n\nNTA. Surprised you lasted that long.", "NTA at all. \n\n\nYou are a STRONG and INDEPENDENT human. You are raising a child and working hard and getting shit done. \n\nYou can do all of that without him. He is that weight of the world on your shoulders. He didn\u2019t stick up for you at all. Never has done in all the years you\u2019ve been with him. He\u2019s sat right next to you as you endured 10 years of abuse and bullying and he drags you back to them over and over again to be kicked down all over again. Does he love you? Sounds like he doesn\u2019t even like you. What person does that to someone they \u201clove\u201d? Allows their family to abuse them and then when you walk away he drags you back so they can keep abusing you. \n\n\nStraight up tell him he has two options. Couples counselling or divorce because you refuse to be abused any longer. He can either stick up for you and stand up to the abuse or he will lose his wife and child because you won\u2019t allow your son to watch as his mommy is abused by his own father and fathers family. \n\nYour son is watching. Don\u2019t allow your son to end up like your husband. Don\u2019t let him be spineless. You\u2019ll be watching it all happen again when he gets a girlfriend and he allows her to be abused too and he drags her back to continue to be abused. Don\u2019t like the cycle continue. \n\nBreak it. Lean on your friends. Show your son that you refuse to tolerate the abuse and show your son how to be a kind and empathetic human being.", "NTA.I am so sorry this happend.But I gotta be honest. Why are you still in contact? I would have given by husband an untimatun a looong time ago. Especially with you having a child. Do you really want then to influence your child? Chances are the also talk badly about you infornt of him. Or god forbid treat him badly also. Is this the example you wanna give? That it doesn't matter that you get treated like shit by your family inlaws? Or worse that you child will actually start thinking like them? Srsly you need to go nc. For yourself and your kids. I hope you get the love, help and respect you derserve. You did not deserve being tteated like this! \u2764", "ESH and pretty sure we're not getting the full story.", "NTA! I bet that you feel better now though don't you? To be able to spew All of that out, the release was impossible to be kept. Now on to the Queen Bee Auntie Thea. I'm quite sure that you left a tad bit for her, right?", "NTA\n\nOmg dump the husband. Dump the whole fucking guy so he can crawl back into his mothers uterus. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard he can hold on to the cord that is clearly still attached.\n\nIf he sits by letting his family treat you like that then LEAVE for the love of all that is holy", "NTA. And if your husband thinks you're jealous because this new girlfriend is being treated kindly, he is indirectly admitting that his family is awful to you. And since he has done nothing to stop it, that means he's okay with it. \n\nFamily is what we make it to be. Now that things are reopening look to join clubs/activities that interest you and hopefully you can start to meet people who will value you for who you are. \n\nAlso, if you allow Atticus to be exposed to this toxic behavior, he will grow up believing it's okay. Do you want that for him?", "NTA in the slightest your husband should have been sticking up for you at the get go and not allowing his mother to treat you so poorly for so long. I think your husband deserves to get blown up at for allowing you to be treated so poorly. Please don't feel bad for sticking up for yourself your mother-in-law can cry. It's not even close to what she was doing to you. Too bad you can't warn your brother-in-law's new girlfriend about the family. Someday they could turn on her and treat her bad too then she'd be stuck.", "NTA \nI would've yanked someone's hair out years ago. An outburst is nothing compared to what you've suffered for 10 years.", " \nNTA so so sooooo NTA and your husband needs to remove head from places they ought not be and realize your not \" JeAlOuS oF jAcObS gIrLfRiEnD\" but rather (insert emotions here) at your family's disgusting behavior. His mother deserved every bit of what youd said and he should've been doing more this whole time. What kind of husband let's his gross ass family bully his wife for reasons beyond her control then tries to berate her like a child when she's finally sick of it? No sir. The fact ya'll were still even in contact with such toxic people is heartbreaking. I'm sorry you haven't had the support you should've from the people who are supposed to provide it.", " NTA- I\u2019m so sorry you married a man who lets you get treated like garbage", "INFO: Why would they accept her and not you if everything is based on your background.\n\nMy feeling is that there's more to it", "YTA huge friggin asshole you deserve the fallout", "Nta you should get couples therapy and get your husband to stick up for you more.", "Agree that it's not really jealousy so much as a slap in the face because she's been so mistreated.", "I think this is partially a problem in presenting jealousy/envy as inherently bad. Emotions aren't bad, they just tell you things: and what you do with them is what matters.\n\nBf is using \"you're jealous\" to dismiss OP's feelings, whereas OP's envy is exactly appropropriate! You envy someone getting treated well when you weren't, because you too should be treated well! Eugh.", "I have always thought that *I'm worth it! A*nd so I ain't got no more time for the BS. I owe me the respect of people being civil and pleasant to me because I am not unpleasant or uncivil to them. Everybody who can't get with the program can kiss the bright side of my arse. I'm out. Don't need it. \ud83e\udd23", "I agree with this! Another reason to speak with her is that if anyone goes and tells her that you're jealous she will understand that that is not the issue. The issue is that you've been mistreated. ALSO, she could be your best advocate and even a good friend who will stick up for you when your husband isn't.", "yes! or maybe even 9 years ago.", "This rings true. Although in my similar situation the one treated better is male so I make the joke that he is the better treated in-law because he has a dick. Then I make him have hard conversations with them like convince them to do smart things instead of stupid things. It works about half the time.", "You said you were in the state system. I've been a foster parent and have seen teenagers, so close to aging out of the system, desperately trying to create a family of their own. It's terrifying to be out in the world alone. Sometimes even bad situations feel safer than that. Your husband doesn't sound like he's abusive, but he's not protecting you from people who are. Either he needs to step up or you need to step out. You don't want your child to grow up thinking it's okay that his mother is treated this way.", "Move away!!!", "I hope you realize, based on all these comments, that you definitely have a reason to be angry and I hope you put your foot down and take up for yourself going forward. We support you!", "It is likely that they want to turn her against you, so you should clarify that the tense situation that will come (because it has not ended) has nothing to do with her, tell her that you had a past similar to hers but instead of understanding The family treated you badly for 10 years and it is now that she arrived that you could understand that it was never about your past, but that they did everything to hurt you (if it were not your past they would have found another reason to harm you).\n\nI know you come from a sad place and when we're in the dark we tend to cling to any ray of light, no matter how small, but if you try to turn your husband against his family, you'll probably see his true colors.\n\nI can't suggest you go or stay, I just wish that your choice brings you happiness\n\nsorry google translate", "NTA\n\nIf you're an AH for being the only one (you are the main character in the story that is your life) that advocates and stands up for yourself.....Then I'll get AH tattooed on me, bc I guess I'm a huge AH. I am always down to be my own hero in my story.", "Ahh yes, the type that think their bloodline is soooo special that it needs to be held close even if it's been muddied. I wish this was sarcasm....", "Just know every Greek family is definitely not like this. My husband is not Greek, and my family accepted him. My uncles back in Greece did have an issue at first but my parents stood up for my husband and my choice, and they backed down and apologized and actually have a good relationship with my husband.  If your MIL had stood up to his Thea I'm sure things may have gone differently.  Your MIL is the Malaka...lol.", "It's derived from Greek, but that doesn't mean it's a unique characteristic of Greek culture. The word \"xenophobia\" was coined *in English* in the early 20th century. You wouldn't say that fear of spiders (arachnophobia) is particular to Greek culture, would you?", "Listen, I am saying this because I am concerned, and it isn't intended in any way as an attack. \n\nBut you essentially responded to the question why you stay with \"But I **luuuuuuuv hiiiiiim**.\" \n\nI loved my family growing up. And they treated me like hot garbage. Finally, I began to recognize that even though I loved these toxic people, that they were treating me poorly, destroying me. So I had to walk away. I still occasionally miss them, but I don't miss how they made me feel. \n\nDo you love your husband? That is very obvious. But does he **respect** you? Also obviously... he doesn't. So, you need to respect ***yourself*** and you need to break away from the man who just got mad at ***YOU*** for defending yourself.", "I strongly encourage you to consider therapy for yourself. Regardless of what happens with your relationship with your in-laws or with your husband, a therapist will be a great help to you.", "Understood.", "NTA. I feel sorry for what you went through. If I get it right, your MIL changed when she realized she was about to loose her son. So he stood up for you,no? I understand how hard it can be to stand up to your own family, your aunts,uncles and so on, especially in a culture such as Greek where family and their elders are held in high esteem. So kudos to your husband and you. \n\nProbably it was kinda unfair that you blew off against your MIL, who is the one who came around. But sometimes you can't keep it to yourself and sometimes it also helps because now she knows how you've felt all the time. Time will tell if she acts on it or not. You can always try to limit contact with his larger family as much as possible. If he doesn't get why then he's an AH.", "They have kids, at least a son. That's why the MiL stopped *actively* joining in on the \"fun\"(in front of OP anyways). Him calling her Jealous for her **not** being ok that someone *else* is not treated like absolute sh!t for having the **exact same circumstances that** *he's let his family abuse her for 10 years over.* He's basically telling her to shut up and take it. This might be too far gone for couples therapy....", "I\u2019m kinda stuck between YTA and NTA because though MIL was one of the bullies she has stopped because she wants son to be happy but at the same time you probably shouldn\u2019t have blown up at MIL as she was just poking the bear but again you were not in a good head space I would explain why you blew up and apologize for blowing up and then give the ultimatum later like a few hours later just to be sure", "But whatever you decide is supported by the people of this subreddits community"]}
