He said he isn't sure if he wants to be a sitter anymore.\n\nI asked if he was unhappy and what we could do to change it.

You asked your babysitter how to care for your child after they leave their employment as though its their burden to help you change care providers. This is up to you and your wife to figure out. Your babysitter doesn't owe you to find their replacement or figure out the next step in arrangements. The sitter has given you notice, he won't continue after your child reaches puberty. So plan accordingly. Mentioning institutionalization may have been tactless but you're asking the wrong person how to manage your child's care needs. You should probably let him know that you understand that working for you is not his lifelong career and you reacted badly so you're sorry and you don't expect him to figure out what you and your wife will do going forward.", "YTA -  a sitter is not a permanent family position or long-term obligation and, frankly, it's not his job to help you figure out your next steps.", "YTA\n\n> I asked him what we are supposed to do if he leaves\n\nThat is not his fuckin problem.

It says a lot that Max suggested institutionalization instead of... you taking care of your child.", ">I asked him what we were supposed to do if he leaves and he said to start looking at institutions.\n\nThat's a crappy answer, but you asked a shitty question. \"What am I supposed to do without you?\" is a manipulative, guilt-tripping question, particularly in this context. It has me suspicious that you've been relying on Max for a lot of things that go well beyond the role of \"babysitter,\" which is also not usually a permanent job. I have a feeling that your son needs more care and assistance than you've really stated, and you want Max to stick around because a \"sitter\" is cheaper than a specialized caregiver that your son probably actually needs.\n\nI'm gonna go with YTA.", "YTA. The solution of max leaving is that you hire another sitter. You can\u2019t force him to work for you and he is under no obligation to stay.

Why would you even ask him that?  Is it his job to arrange a replacement?  No.  What you do is neither his business nor his problem to solve for you.  There was no purpose to that question except to make Max feel bad about making a decision for his own happiness.  And given how long Max has been there for you and the fact that he was giving you a heads up, it was especially uncalled for for you to respond this way.  \n\nRude questions intended to guilt, manipulate, or make the other person feel bad often get rude responses.

Either way YTA because it is not the sitter problem, he is not the kid's parent and he can quit at any time for any reason.", "YTA\n\nDid you really expect a stranger to put their life on hold for your child? Because this sounds exactly like you planned for Max to be a permanent caregiver for Charlie.\n\nYou are the parent, not Max. It is your responsibility to find someone who can and is willing to take care of Charlie. While the comment may be harsh, Max does have a point in that you need to think about the future and set Charlie up for that.\n\nWho's going to take care of Charlie when you' and your wife are retired? When you guys pass away? This is something that any parent with a disabled, chronically ill or severely autistic child will have to think about.\n\nYou can't just dump Charlie and your responsibilities in a sitters' lap and call it a day. Plan ahead and plan early because we all have an expiration date and none of us know it.", "YTA. Your son is your responsibility. Find another sitter, who works with teens/adults. I hope you didn't expect Max to stay with him forever.", "YTA. This guy isn\u2019t his parent and hasn\u2019t signed up for life. What would you have done if he had been off long term sick? You should already have contingency plans in place or at least thought about this scenario", "YTA. You are not entitled to have someone be your sitter for the rest of your kids life. Just because he has been the sitter for awhile now does not mean he will be for years to come if he don\u2019t want to. If he said to put the kid in an institution maybe it\u2019s because he knows you guys don\u2019t do anything with the kid. It\u2019s not up to him to help you guys find someone else, especially not after that attitude you gave.", "YTA It's none of your business why he is choosing to stop babysitting. Sounds to me like you are se dependant on Max that you think you get to dictate his life. \n\nBe a parent.", "YTA. You can take care of your kid.", "YTA - you asked a question and he answered, did you honestly expect him to look after your kid forever?\n\nThis was a babysitting job, not a lifetime commitment", "YTA.  What would you do if Max were to be unable to properly care for Charlie due to a circumstance out of his control such as a long-term sickness or injury?  True, an institution wouldn't be ideal, but are you and your wife in any position for one of you to quit your jobs to be a full-time caregiver to Charlie?  In an institution, he'd get around-the-clock care and if something were to happen whoever was in charge of looking after him would be held responsible.", "YTA. Max is not responsible for your son - you are. You have to make arrangements for his care.", "Bruh you handle that so damn wrong how about try being compassionate! Try saying: thank you for being so patient and close with max for so long and we really appreciated having you and getting to know you, your such a great sitter and became such a big part of our lives even as family and i wish you all the best of luck to your future if this is what you decide to do and your welcome to visit anytime and keep in touch with max if you like i know it will mean the world to him!", "NAH and the lack of empathy shown towards you makes me sad.", "NTA. He should have chosen his words carefully.", "YTA.  Are you afraid you'll have to spend more time with your son. The sitter has valid reasons for not wanting to babysit anymore.", "YTA\n\nCharlie is not Max's child.  It is not Max's responsibility to be there for Charlie's entire life.  You're not thinking ahead very well if you thought Max would be there his whole life.  It is your responsibility to ensure Charlie is cared for.", "ESH. max sucks for leaving because \u201cits not cute anymore\u201d\u2026 what is that even supposed to mean, he\u2019s a person, not a doll. you for not taking no as no. he said he\u2019s leaving, you do not whine and beg and put him in an extremely awkward and uncomfortable position. suck it up and find another caretaker.", "Info: how old is the sitter you expect to stay with you indefinitely?\n\nIf you want to keep this sitter, I suggest you pay $75k plus benefits.", "YTA. He said that after you tried to shame him for giving notice that he will no longer be working for you. You are trying to make your son his responsibility. How about you stay home and care for your son full time if you can't or won't hire someone else.", "YTA. You are Charlie\u2019s parent. You. You are their caregiver and their advocate. Take responsibility for your child and decide what is best for him with your partner, not anyone else.", "YTA, slavery isn\u2019t really in anymore", "YTA - YOU are the parent - YOU are the one who has to stay with Charlie for the rest of his life and care for him NOT YOUR SITTER.   I mean really what a jerk move!   Did you think this person was going to stay with you forever?????????", "The fact that they suggested institution instead of a new carer, group home, etc. Says a lot about the care needed for the child.", "That's not an assessment I'd make in a professional environment about someone's kid... and I sure as shit wouldn't ask the person who said it how to continue raising my kid after they quit.", "Honestly, I agree with you.  My oldest son will be 19 next month.  He's very high functioning autistic.  He'd be confused with someone who is thought of as \"normal\", aside from his quirks.  Not all autistic kids are the same.  Autism is called a spectrum for a reason.  OP's remarks here are really insensitive and fucked up.", "Imagine making this statement about your child and then being offended about someone else saying something about him.", "I stopped reading after that comment. Just gross.", "That doesn't really apply here, why should it matter if the kid you're looking after is cute or behaving \"cute\"?", "With my math skills, I won\u2019t be either. Also not autistic", "That's awesome!  I'm proud of her too!", "Yes, thank you for pointing this out. OP is definitely the AH in this situation, but I\u2019m also picking up on ableism from the caregiver that makes me deeply uncomfortable. I\u2019m just sad for Charlie that he\u2019s surrounded by adults who don\u2019t treat him like a person. Whatever his future situation is like, I hope he\u2019s happy and surrounded only by people who give him the agency and respect he deserves.", "Well like you say, autism is a spectrum. It seems the point of the comment was to say that Charlie is not on the high functioning side of the spectrum.", "That's what OP should have said.  What he said is really insensitive to people.", "To me, this comment is kinda ironic. Many of the autistic people I know have no problem being blunt."]}
