He said he isn't sure if he wants to be a sitter anymore.\n\nI asked if he was unhappy and what we could do to change it.

I asked him what we were supposed to do if he leaves and he said to start looking at institutions.\n\nI told him that was pretty fucked up to suggest.

You asked your babysitter how to care for your child after they leave their employment as though its their burden to help you change care providers. This is up to you and your wife to figure out. Your babysitter doesn't owe you to find their replacement or figure out the next step in arrangements. The sitter has given you notice, he won't continue after your child reaches puberty. So plan accordingly. Mentioning institutionalization may have been tactless but you're asking the wrong person how to manage your child's care needs. You should probably let him know that you understand that working for you is not his lifelong career and you reacted badly so you're sorry and you don't expect him to figure out what you and your wife will do going forward.", "YTA -  a sitter is not a permanent family position or long-term obligation and, frankly, it's not his job to help you figure out your next steps.", "YTA\n\n> I asked him what we are supposed to do if he leaves\n\nThat is not his fuckin problem. That's a question *you* should already know the answer to!

It says a lot that Max suggested institutionalization instead of... you taking care of your child.", ">I asked him what we were supposed to do if he leaves and he said to start looking at institutions.\n\nThat's a crappy answer, but you asked a shitty question. \"What am I supposed to do without you?\" is a manipulative, guilt-tripping question, particularly in this context. It has me suspicious that you've been relying on Max for a lot of things that go well beyond the role of \"babysitter,\" which is also not usually a permanent job. I have a feeling that your son needs more care and assistance than you've really stated, and you want Max to stick around because a \"sitter\" is cheaper than a specialized caregiver that your son probably actually needs.\n\nI'm gonna go with YTA.", "YTA. The solution of max leaving is that you hire another sitter. You can\u2019t force him to work for you and he is under no obligation to stay.

Why would you even ask him that?  Is it his job to arrange a replacement?  No.  What you do is neither his business nor his problem to solve for you.  There was no purpose to that question except to make Max feel bad about making a decision for his own happiness.  And given how long Max has been there for you and the fact that he was giving you a heads up, it was especially uncalled for for you to respond this way.  \n\nRude questions intended to guilt, manipulate, or make the other person feel bad often get rude responses.

You\u2019re not going to be here for ever and don\u2019t think for one minute you can bully or pressure your family/ your wives family to care for him if they don\u2019t want to if something happens.

I never mentioned the sitter until literally a sentence after I finished talking about the child being a preteen. Please take a reading comprehension class or re-read my comment. My punctuation should have made it clear.", "I should also mention that waiting lists to get into a group home or even a qualified one on one caregiver is disgustingly long.  As in they need to start now for a year down the road..if Max doesn\u2019t  leave immediately based on how he was treated.", "Duh, the answer is have another kid and make it very clear from an early age that Max is their future problem. /s", ">if Max doesn\u2019t  leave immediately based on how he was treated.\n\nI've actually left a babysitting job for less than OP's comments, if you like your babysitter do not mistreat them. I have to say is usually the parent thats away from the house the most that has given me the issues. Some of them had no idea what babysitting on a usual day will look like so they think we sitting around doing nothing the entire day.\n\nOne husband accused me of staying too long and charging extra but he didn't realise his wife was working late or stuck in traffic all those days, and I had the messages to prove it. Of course I can't just abandon the kids before a parent comes back, some evenings the wife would ask me to stay another 30 minutes so she can have a shower/rest. Your wife might work 9-5, but i need to be there before 9am and after 5pm, because your wife doesn't have a magical portal to and from work (of course, the billing is for more than 9-5)\n\nHonestly, nobody should expect a babysitter to stay forever. Kids grow up and go to school, then they need less care hours. Babysitters have lives and expenses too, so if you aren't giving them enough hours they need to fnd employment else where. Sometimes they are not doing it as a career but as a inbetween thing.\n\nAlso, there are always babysitting jobs. everyone knows if you find a good babysitter you treat them well, because another moms are always willing to poach a good sitter.", "I know you might of added the sarcasm, but i feel like there have beeen so many posts about that situation in aita, and it might be best not to give OP any ideas. (even as joke)"]}
