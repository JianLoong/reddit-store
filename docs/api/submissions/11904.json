I can't even fathom the hubris it takes to act as he did and has over and over. He thinks he's the shit. No sir, sir you ARE shit. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\n\"Let's straighten this out. You never paid child support and straight up left. Twice. You may have contributed to my children biologically,  but that is where your fatherhood ends. You are by all accounts and definitions a sperm donor.  If you wanted my kids to turn out differently,  you should have involved yourself more and been an actual father. You embarrassed yourself. I hope this teaches you a valuable lesson on involving yourself in something you have no experience in.  \"", "He crossed the line when he said all of those horrible things about your son.", "NTA", "NTA. Had he been paying child support and visiting before now? If not then he's not their dad at all. \n\nAnd regardless he started it and deserved what he got. He can dish it out and not take it.", "NTA. But if he's been out of the kids lives and you don't generally have contact, why do you have his phone number? Just curious.  If it were me, I would block that number faster than it takes to blink.  You don't owe the ex anything.", "NTA (and frankly you could have gone much further and should be NTA all the same). He embarrassed himself. And his Mommy can sod off, too. The spineless deadbeat deserves public obloquy\u2014and you didn\u2019t even plan it.", "Ahhh!!!! This stuff buggs the living hell out of me because I've been there. My Ex, decided when our son's were 2 and 5 that he wanted a very different lifestyle than we were currently living. (He wants strippers a s drUG$$ instead of a 9-5 and a lovely home with dinner on the table every evening lol. Good, have at er. He would go months at a time between so much as a phone call to my boys. Because they were so young, they don't even really remember much about him. BUT because I had him on social media, he used to snag pictures I posted of them and re post with tags like \"Daddy's boys\" or \" True *insert last name* genes in these boys\". Etc. It was annoying, but not worth the fight, anyone who mattered knew he was full of s**t. My youngest son has always had long hair, since he was a toddler, 9 years of long hair, nothing new. My ex, who moved across the country and had stopped all contact by this time, decided to comment on a picture of him \"you need to cut my son's hair, you're letting him walk around looking like a girl!\". I replied with a snide comment about how my current husband has been their father for a lot longer than he ever was, they were not \"his son's\" as they could easily walk by him on the street and not know who he was, and he lost the right to have a say in their appearance the day he left us. I then blocked him from seeing pictures on my social and that was the last I ever heard from him \ud83d\ude0c so happy ending. But I know how infuriating it can be for someone to try to step in and have a say in someone who YOU have raised.", "NTA No way he has the guts to call your son a loser just because your son express himself, while the guy runs to his mom like a child when he gets humiliated and when he\u2019s worst than a deadbeat dad lmao", "NTA\n\nHe was a sperm donor, not a dad \n\nIf he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed in public he shouldn\u2019t have approached you in public", "NTA\nOP tell his mom that is if she wants to stand up for him when he is insulting her grand child then she should have told him off when he left his responsibilities as a father. Tell the mother-in-law that is her responsibility to parent her child to be a decent human being, but since she didn\u2019t do that, her son grew up being entitled shit. inform her that you are your sons, mom and you will always have your children back no matter what specially against somebody who has no part in raising them.", "Sometimes people need to be embarrassed publicly", "There is no \"OUR\"\n\nThey are your kids.  He is not a father, he is a sperm doner.  \n\nNTA.  Tell it often, loud, and proud.  Who cares how he feels.  The truth hurts.", "NTA.  He is no father.", "NTA. Ex's mommy needs to be informed of how her man-boy behaved in public before she starts casting stones.", "Nta. Can you not file for unpaid child support? Seen as he is now back in the area and has made it very clear that they are \"his\" kids.", "NTA he literally started it and got upset when you gave back better than he sent.\n\nsounds like your son has a good angle of daddy dearest and holds him in the contempt he's earned", "NTA but should have let the son finish the sperm donor.", "NTA. But my god the balls on this guy\u2026", "NTA.  He is literally an absent father who abandoned his kids.  He has a lot of nerve--good for you for shutting him down.  Plus why is these ah are certainly ok with berating and bullying others in public, but cry like babies when the get their a$$ handed back to them?  Never fails.  Then has his mommy call you.", "NTA he embarrassed himself.", "NTA, that man is a failure, that man is a waste, he has no right to call himself a father.", "nta", "NTA, but I'm curious, why do you care at all what his mother thinks?  After all, she raised HIM, and look how he turned out.", "Your son is going to succeed in life with sass like that, get him some ice cream\n\nNta at all", "NTA\n\nAnd to discuss your title. I am generally opposed to people insulting their ex to others. It's usually biased.  This story isn't actually about your Ex. That status doesn't really play into it.\n\nMostly he is an asshole that was out of line. You comments are fine and justified. Partly this is a story about your kid's dad, but mostly it's just an asshole spouting off and then hurt when he gets the same in return.", "Yta.", "If he's worried about appearances, then he should have appeared in his kids' life. NTA", "Honestly you did the right thing by intervening, your son doesn\u2019t need the extra stress of arguing with a dead beat dad.

OP I love that your son stood up for himself here and didn't let his 'dad' bully him. Great work!", "Only thing better would have been what my brother-in-law told his dad as a teen.

His mom raised a failure, so I wouldn't look to her for advice.", "NTA he should have Sid hello me just kept his mouth shut. He\u2019s their bio father but they aren\u2019t his kids.", "Nta. He opted out long ago.", "NTA.\n\nLet his mother know that it takes more than blood and sperm to be a father. And he hasn't been anything these last few years. So the kids have every right to not recognize not to acknowledge him as such.

Came her to say \"*He is the sperm donor and OP can never take that from him!\"", "That\u2019s unfair to legitimate sperm donors, they don\u2019t insult their donor kids in public.", "I can\u2019t believe his mom heard about this and decided her deadbeat asshole son was the aggrieved party, lol.
