My eldest daughter was 1. He came back when the twins were 11 but left again. Haven\u2019t heard from him since and the kids are 18f, 17m, 17f.\n\nWell we went out to dinner a couple nights ago. I knew my ex was in the area but we weren\u2019t about to stop living just because of him. We ran into him at the restaurant. He didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all which I could not care less about but he immediately started on the kids about how big they\u2019ve gotten. My girls ignored him but my son laughed. This got his dad\u2019s attention. \n\nContext: my son has piercings, tattoos and cares about how he dresses. But I\u2019ve seen a lot of teenage boys that dress like him so it\u2019s nothing outrageous. He has ear length hair with pink highlights and a bit of a fringe too. \n\nWell my ex made a face and said \u201cwhat\u2019s with the look\u201d I told my son to ignore him and was about to tell him to fuck off but my son ignored me and mockingly asked if he liked it. My ex said \u201cnow I know you\u2019ve never had a real man around but...\u201d \n\nMy son interrupted with \u201cwhose fault is that?\u201d \n\nI put my foot down though because they both have bad tempers and told my son to wait by the car with his sisters. \n\nMy ex immediately rounded on me and asked me wtf I was thinking when I let \u201cour\u201d son \u201cruin\u201d himself. I told him he was crazy but this man started throwing a tantrum about how he\u2019ll never be able to face his friends when their sons are athletes and his son is some girly loser all because of me.\n\nI rolled my eyes and said \u201cif MY son really is a loser, then it\u2019d be because of you not me-after all, you\u2019re the biggest fucking failure on the planet. But he isn\u2019t a loser, -which is actually all because of me- so why do you think you even have the right to brag about him like he\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\nHe got real red and said \u201che is mine\u201d before stomping out. He then texted me saying that I embarrassed him in public and that no matter what, he\u2019s still their dad and I can\u2019t take that away from him. His mom called me saying that I went too far, especially in public. Thing is, I don\u2019t think anyone cared and second of all, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said shit about me or my kids. Still, his mom usually stays out of it so AITA?
