This is a townhouse with multiple levels. In brief: \n\n1st level is the hall, kitchen & toilet,\n2nd level is the master bedroom & toilet & a mini hall for baby stuff\n3rd level has 3 rooms & a common toilet (2 used by my brother, 1 room used to store stuff and for cats to poo). \n\nMy brother (29M) stays with us and he is also married to his (28F) wife from Ohio (we're Asians). She's got mild autism and some antisocial tendencies, i.e. she can only interact with my brother and their 4 cats. She never speaks to me nor my wife, and doesn't acknowledge my kid as she hates babies. \n\nWe were living somewhat happily with each of us occupying a level for ourselves. My dad has the hall as he was partially debilitated (bro and i would help him whenever he calls us), i took the master bedroom level for my family, and my brother and his wife occupied the top level. \n\nToday:\nDad died in October, leaving my bro and I. My father in law offered us a helper to help take care of our baby since the baby is super active and demands our attention and time. Wife's been struggling to handle the baby by herself and needs my constant support. A helper will greatly help take a load off our shoulders, as my wife can work and i can start to find a better paying job. \n\nBased on the house layout, logically the choice would be to utilize the 1 extra room for the helper. \n\nWhen i spoke to my brother, he flipped. He said the top level has always been his. Him and his wife walk around in boxers and panties and they cant do that anymore, making them uncomfortable. Since that room is also used to house the cats poo, the cats wont have anywhere else to poo. And brother's wife will just stay in her room as she is deathly afraid of other people. Because of this, he will have to move out, and he will do so within these few months. But not before making me feel like a total AH, as he said he will F Off and i will be free to do anything i want since it's my home (his words, not mine). \n\nAs an added guilt trip, our dad before he passed, told us to always stick together and be around for each other, so that we wont be estranged like him and his brother before us. And only about a month after his death, we are already planning to split up, making me feel absolutely shitty. \n\nSome context - my bro and I were really close since we were kids. Our mom died when i was 12, and he was 8. However things got strained between us when he got married..he seemed to take on his wife's persona and became more reclusive rather than helping his wife overcome her social anxiety. This also hit me hard. \n\nTLDR; AITA for wanting an extra room for a helper and consequently 'pressuring' my brother to move out within a month from my dad dying?", "created_utc": 1668268031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytakmd/aita_for_wanting_to_use_an_extra_room_in_my_own/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And lastly idk for sure but shutting you out for the wife seems odd. Like I\u2019m on the spectrum and I have a hard time communicating with new people.

Litter box can go in one of his 2 rooms that his wife uses. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about her mental illness and social anxiety, but you need to do what works best for your family. You need a nanny now, and child will eventually need his own room also when older. \n\nDo you have a lease with brother? Does he and wife have exclusive use of top bathroom? He and nanny would have to share, which would also cause more problems.", "NTA.\n\nThreshold question:  is it your house now?  Or is both yours and your brothers?  \n\nYou clearly own the house.  Unless you want to treat it as shared, your choice going forward.\n\nAre you choosing to add someone in a way that doesn\u2019t displace your brother and minimizes impacts on him?  Yes you are.  He could still have two of the three rooms\n\nIs it regrettable that the new arrangement is having an adverse impact on them?  Of course.\n\nYour brother is having his current situation which works well for him changed.  If he doesn\u2019t like the change, he can find a different place to live.  And he is doing that.  The way to honor your dad\u2019s wishes is to be cordial, make sure he knows you care about him, and you not breaking contact with him.  It is then up to your brother to also honor your dad\u2019s wishes.", "Nta. It's  time for him to grow up.", "NTA This had to happen at some point, as your child will only get older and need more space, and you may even have another child.\n\nIt sounds like your brother and his wife need their own sacrosanct space and your house could only ever provide the illusion of that temporarily.\n\nIn a way it's better this happen now rather than later when you will have an older child clamoring for their own room and a predictably even more reclusive and antisocial couple upstairs who, over the years, have come to see \"their\" floor as their permanent home and private domain.", "ESH: You own the house and you need the help, you need to grow into more space - it makes sense for you.

And at crappy time, with your dad's passing.\n\n\nHowever, they don't have a right to your house and your space. You've offered a reasonable compromise, that spare room is unused, and they're not happy; so they need to decide if that compromise is liveable for them or not.

It is your house and your brother and sister in law dont sound as if they contribute much. If youre worried that you arent sticking together, is there a possible compromise? Do you truly need a live in helper? Could your helper just come over for part of the day? You would get help, and surely an extra person in the home would make them realize how things are changing while reminding them that this is YOUR house and time for them to make other arrangements in the near future. This is a slower process, but less stress on your relationship with your brother.", "NTA - it\u2019s your property. Does your brother even pay you rent and utilities?", "NTA.  I'd help him pack up and move out of YOUR house.  His problem on where to live.  His wife would be better off in their own home IMO since she can't stand babies or people around her.  In fact,  you would be doing them a favor by them moving and getting their own personal space <eg>", "Just try to be nice in the mean time.\n\nSounds like this can\u2019t go on forever.\n\nMaybe sincerely try to help him with the new place, ask if he\u2019d want help with a realtor maybe.\n\nIf you own a home, there are lots of ways you could help him, (if you choose) but maybe also try to help them think about positives.\n\nThey may end up with a whole house where they can walk around nude, and a garage or more spaces for the cats to play.\n\nYou can stay together more closely while being further apart than you\u2019d be able to while cramping each others style.\n\nEventually your kid will need that room and they may not be the last one.\n\nEveryone needs space.", "I guess my late dad was partly to blame, he was always the 'baby' of the family while i was always the one that advocated tough love. I was always viewed as the evil one, not wanting to freely help him so that he learns the ropes of life himself. But his choice of words stung the most i guess. I spoke diplomatically and he was shouting at the top of his lungs. It was sad for me.", "Plus, his wife is using her being in the spectrum to be rude. If she has high-functioning autism she's able to interact with others. She's choosing not to. Yes, she can be \"awkward\" around others, and she can have social anxiety but a lot of people do and that doesn't make them AHs. She's choosing to be rude to the people giving her a place to live and their baby. She can do better than that, even if she needs to step a bit out of her comfort zone.", "Well, to be brutally honest I'm not fortunate to afford live in care... my Father in Law who loves his first grandchild is sponsoring her costs on a month to month basis. All i have to do is to make sure the helper has a comfortable place to live. And my brother's outburst is making things complicated, especially since it's only been a month since my dad passed...", "Well he pays half of the utilities.. other than that its all on me. The title to the house has my name on it. It's just that he stayed on as my dad wanted us all to be together, and he can't afford to buy his own house (house prices in my country are through the roof). So he will have to rent a place.\n\nHe has been married to his wife for the past 6 years. I can count the number of times we interact. I mean my brother at least tries to talk to me but his wife just keeps to herself and actively avoids people. I got married in 2020 and she only spoke to my wife on, like, 3 occasions to ask my wife to shut the windows so the cats wont jump out..\n\nWhen i told him his wife has issues and he should get her checked, he flat out denied and said she's absolutely fine and that's just the way she is.. so yeah... there's that.", "We have no lease. Its just a 'social contract' of sorts as we are Asians and culturally there's an element of familial bond where we try to stick together where we can. I tried my best to uphold my dad's wishes since I'm the only family he's got, but it's getting awfully difficult to do so with a growing kid (and potentially more to come)", "It is fully mine. My name is on the title, just that he has been living in since before I bought the house from my dad. Mind you, we don't stay in America (Asian BTW) so the laws aren't as cut and dry for occupancy and tenancy. As i said in other replies, he only pays half of the utilities. The rest of the utilities, mortgage, land taxes, etc are on me.\n\nIf its any consolation, I did tell him that the house is always available for him if shit hits the fan out there (retrenchment exercises, etc) but he has to accept the conditions as they are. I guess its just the timing being so soon from my dad's passing that makes me feel shitty that he is moving out.", "What about giving the helper dad\u2019s old room? I know that may be an unpopular opinion but it is something to consider.", "Only half of the utilities. The mortgage, yearly taxes, remaining half of the utilities are on me.", "I always suspected this, she can speak perfectly if the need arises. On my dad's funeral all my aunts and uncles came from far away places and she spoke normally. So i suspect she just chose not to interact with my wife and i, and keep things to herself. She has been married to my brother for 6 years and i have barely any interaction with her.", "The timing is indeed unfortunate.  That said, the timing was not a matter of choice on your part.", "I think it sounds like dad was in a corridor type hall space, so possibly not private enough for an external/unrelated person", "The dad did not have a room. He lived in the foyer it sounds like.", "Then do what is best for you. Your child is a baby now, but when they get older they will wonder why the person in the ceiling won't engage with them.", "There you have your answer.", "You're right. He had a teak bed that he just layed on in the hall. It is an open space. It was most convenient as the toilet is a few steps away and he had the TV and the kitchen nearby. Everything was within arm's reach since he was not able to walk by himself up to the point of his passing, so the hall would have been out of the question, as the helper would definitely need her own private space to rest after a long day to care for my demanding child...", "Fair point on the child's development. While my brother at least tries to interact with his nephew whom i can see he sincerely loves, his wife just does not give a shit. And when i asked if they can help if i choose to not have a nanny, he admitted that they couldnt care for the child if my wife and i had to work. I guess it's more on the sentiment of late dad's wishes that tugs at my heartstrings more than anything, making me feel like the AH...", "But my brother doesnt see this. Unfortunately he seems to have been sucked in by her charms and there's really nothing i can do about it. I love him dearly but his wife is driving a wedge between us. And i guess the worst part is the timing of this as it's happening so soon after my dad passed.", "I get that not everyone is kid minded. That is fair. You and your wife obviously need help with your baby which is completely fair. I'm a teacher. I work with kids all day, but give me a baby and I'll run for the hills. That being said I won't begrudge someone getting help with said baby. They can go walk around half naked in their own place. Your dad's wishes does not mean you have to be your brother's keeper for the rest of your life. What if you have more kids? If you guys can afford a nanny then go for it.  You need to think about your baby, your wife and yourself.", "Ultimately it's your brother's choice. Plus, I doubt he doesn't see it. He must know his wife doesn't like you guys because he probably sees she can talk freely outside the house when they go out.\n\nThere must be a reason why she doesn't like you and your family but your brother doesn't wanna tell you.", "That is true. As much as he is prioritising his wife, i should too. I guess i am too hard on myself for trying to be the glue that keeps us together.\n\nAs for the baby, wife and I have sworn that the kid will have no screen time till he is 2. In my country it's all too common to see babies fixated on phone/tablet/tv screens, leading to behavioral/developmental issues. I can see why its convenient, but as a result of this, the baby is constantly exploring, demanding our attention and just wants to play. Hence more care and attention is needed for the little one.", "Good for you. Being the glue is exhausting. I know. Also and this is from years of experience get your child a puppy when they are old enough to not want to gnaw on it because they will just be each other's best friends and keep each other busy. Screen time can be a good thing when it is an interactive programme, but in moderation of course. Avoid cocomelon too much."]}
