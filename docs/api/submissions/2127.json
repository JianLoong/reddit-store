She's got mild autism and some antisocial tendencies, i.e. she can only interact with my brother and their 4 cats. She never speaks to me nor my wife, and doesn't acknowledge my kid as she hates babies. \n\nWe were living somewhat happily with each of us occupying a level for ourselves. My dad has the hall as he was partially debilitated (bro and i would help him whenever he calls us), i took the master bedroom level for my family, and my brother and his wife occupied the top level. \n\nToday:\nDad died in October, leaving my bro and I. My father in law offered us a helper to help take care of our baby since the baby is super active and demands our attention and time.

A helper will greatly help take a load off our shoulders, as my wife can work and i can start to find a better paying job. \n\nBased on the house layout, logically the choice would be to utilize the 1 extra room for the helper. \n\nWhen i spoke to my brother, he flipped. He said the top level has always been his. Him and his wife walk around in boxers and panties and they cant do that anymore, making them uncomfortable. Since that room is also used to house the cats poo, the cats wont have anywhere else to poo. And brother's wife will just stay in her room as she is deathly afraid of other people. Because of this, he will have to move out, and he will do so within these few months. But not before making me feel like a total AH, as he said he will F Off and i will be free to do anything i want since it's my home (his words, not mine). \n\nAs an added guilt trip, our dad before he passed, told us to always stick together and be around for each other, so that we wont be estranged like him and his brother before us. And only about a month after his death, we are already planning to split up, making me feel absolutely shitty. \n\nSome context - my bro and I were really close since we were kids. Our mom died when i was 12, and he was 8. However things got strained between us when he got married..he seemed to take on his wife's persona and became more reclusive rather than helping his wife overcome her social anxiety.

It is your house and your brother and sister in law dont sound as if they contribute much. If youre worried that you arent sticking together, is there a possible compromise? Do you truly need a live in helper? Could your helper just come over for part of the day? You would get help, and surely an extra person in the home would make them realize how things are changing while reminding them that this is YOUR house and time for them to make other arrangements in the near future. This is a slower process, but less stress on your relationship with your brother.", "NTA - it\u2019s your property. Does your brother even pay you rent and utilities?", "NTA.  I'd help him pack up and move out of YOUR house.  His problem on where to live.  His wife would be better off in their own home IMO since she can't stand babies or people around her.  In fact,  you would be doing them a favor by them moving and getting their own personal space <eg>", "Just try to be nice in the mean time.\n\nSounds like this can\u2019t go on forever.\n\nMaybe sincerely try to help him with the new place, ask if he\u2019d want help with a realtor maybe.\n\nIf you own a home, there are lots of ways you could help him, (if you choose) but maybe also try to help them think about positives.\n\nThey may end up with a whole house where they can walk around nude, and a garage or more spaces for the cats to play.\n\nYou can stay together more closely while being further apart than you\u2019d be able to while cramping each others style.\n\nEventually your kid will need that room and they may not be the last one.\n\nEveryone needs space.", "I guess my late dad was partly to blame, he was always the 'baby' of the family while i was always the one that advocated tough love. I was always viewed as the evil one, not wanting to freely help him so that he learns the ropes of life himself. But his choice of words stung the most i guess. I spoke diplomatically and he was shouting at the top of his lungs. It was sad for me.", "Plus, his wife is using her being in the spectrum to be rude. If she has high-functioning autism she's able to interact with others. She's choosing not to. Yes, she can be \"awkward\" around others, and she can have social anxiety but a lot of people do and that doesn't make them AHs. She's choosing to be rude to the people giving her a place to live and their baby. She can do better than that, even if she needs to step a bit out of her comfort zone.", "Well, to be brutally honest I'm not fortunate to afford live in care... my Father in Law who loves his first grandchild is sponsoring her costs on a month to month basis. All i have to do is to make sure the helper has a comfortable place to live. And my brother's outburst is making things complicated, especially since it's only been a month since my dad passed...", "Well he pays half of the utilities.. other than that its all on me. The title to the house has my name on it. It's just that he stayed on as my dad wanted us all to be together, and he can't afford to buy his own house (house prices in my country are through the roof). So he will have to rent a place.\n\nHe has been married to his wife for the past 6 years. I can count the number of times we interact. I mean my brother at least tries to talk to me but his wife just keeps to herself and actively avoids people. I got married in 2020 and she only spoke to my wife on, like, 3 occasions to ask my wife to shut the windows so the cats wont jump out..\n\nWhen i told him his wife has issues and he should get her checked, he flat out denied and said she's absolutely fine and that's just the way she is.. so yeah... there's that.", "We have no lease. Its just a 'social contract' of sorts as we are Asians and culturally there's an element of familial bond where we try to stick together where we can. I tried my best to uphold my dad's wishes since I'm the only family he's got, but it's getting awfully difficult to do so with a growing kid (and potentially more to come)", "It is fully mine. My name is on the title, just that he has been living in since before I bought the house from my dad. Mind you, we don't stay in America (Asian BTW) so the laws aren't as cut and dry for occupancy and tenancy. As i said in other replies, he only pays half of the utilities. The rest of the utilities, mortgage, land taxes, etc are on me.\n\nIf its any consolation, I did tell him that the house is always available for him if shit hits the fan out there (retrenchment exercises, etc) but he has to accept the conditions as they are. I guess its just the timing being so soon from my dad's passing that makes me feel shitty that he is moving out.", "What about giving the helper dad\u2019s old room? I know that may be an unpopular opinion but it is something to consider.", "Only half of the utilities. The mortgage, yearly taxes, remaining half of the utilities are on me.", "I always suspected this, she can speak perfectly if the need arises. On my dad's funeral all my aunts and uncles came from far away places and she spoke normally. So i suspect she just chose not to interact with my wife and i, and keep things to herself. She has been married to my brother for 6 years and i have barely any interaction with her.", "The timing is indeed unfortunate.  That said, the timing was not a matter of choice on your part.", "I think it sounds like dad was in a corridor type hall space, so possibly not private enough for an external/unrelated person", "The dad did not have a room. He lived in the foyer it sounds like.", "Then do what is best for you. Your child is a baby now, but when they get older they will wonder why the person in the ceiling won't engage with them.", "There you have your answer.", "You're right. He had a teak bed that he just layed on in the hall. It is an open space. It was most convenient as the toilet is a few steps away and he had the TV and the kitchen nearby. Everything was within arm's reach since he was not able to walk by himself up to the point of his passing, so the hall would have been out of the question, as the helper would definitely need her own private space to rest after a long day to care for my demanding child...", "Fair point on the child's development. While my brother at least tries to interact with his nephew whom i can see he sincerely loves, his wife just does not give a shit. And when i asked if they can help if i choose to not have a nanny, he admitted that they couldnt care for the child if my wife and i had to work. I guess it's more on the sentiment of late dad's wishes that tugs at my heartstrings more than anything, making me feel like the AH...", "But my brother doesnt see this. Unfortunately he seems to have been sucked in by her charms and there's really nothing i can do about it. I love him dearly but his wife is driving a wedge between us. And i guess the worst part is the timing of this as it's happening so soon after my dad passed.", "I get that not everyone is kid minded. That is fair. You and your wife obviously need help with your baby which is completely fair. I'm a teacher. I work with kids all day, but give me a baby and I'll run for the hills. That being said I won't begrudge someone getting help with said baby. They can go walk around half naked in their own place. Your dad's wishes does not mean you have to be your brother's keeper for the rest of your life. What if you have more kids? If you guys can afford a nanny then go for it.  You need to think about your baby, your wife and yourself.", "Ultimately it's your brother's choice. Plus, I doubt he doesn't see it. He must know his wife doesn't like you guys because he probably sees she can talk freely outside the house when they go out.\n\nThere must be a reason why she doesn't like you and your family but your brother doesn't wanna tell you.", "That is true. As much as he is prioritising his wife, i should too. I guess i am too hard on myself for trying to be the glue that keeps us together.\n\nAs for the baby, wife and I have sworn that the kid will have no screen time till he is 2. In my country it's all too common to see babies fixated on phone/tablet/tv screens, leading to behavioral/developmental issues. I can see why its convenient, but as a result of this, the baby is constantly exploring, demanding our attention and just wants to play. Hence more care and attention is needed for the little one.", "Good for you. Being the glue is exhausting. I know. Also and this is from years of experience get your child a puppy when they are old enough to not want to gnaw on it because they will just be each other's best friends and keep each other busy. Screen time can be a good thing when it is an interactive programme, but in moderation of course. Avoid cocomelon too much.", "NTA\n\nInfo, is your brother paying fair market rent for 3 bedrooms in your area?", "Nta", "INFO: Can\u2019t you just swap levels? So brother and wife have the master bedroom level and you and wife and baby have the top level?", "NTA it's your house your rules.  Your brother and his wife need to grow up and move out and be adults.\nYou have been more then accommodating with them.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU bought the house. So use it. IF your brother can not accept it, let him move out. Where is the threat in that?", "NTA I\u2019m afraid your dad was a bit \n\nYou must stay together all times despite his wife having extreme anxiety disorder", "NTA but could a compromise be a helper that is not live in?", "Love when people baselessly accuse autistic people of faking/exaggerating their symptoms just to be assholes. There isn't enough misinformation surrounding ASD, so it's good to sprinkle some where we can. They should mask all the time lest we find their existence inconvenient.", "If it makes you feel any better, this was going to happen eventually.\n\nSure, right now your 9 month old baby can stay on your floor, but eventually, your child was going to need their own room, and would've needed to move up to the third floor, at which point your brother would probably have gotten just as mad as he is now.", "Unfortunately your family is growing and you need to make adjustments for that. It\u2019s unfair that your brother feels he\u2019s entitled to 3/4 of the bedrooms in \u201c your\u201d home. What happens when your baby also needs a room.", "It's called masking, and it's very stressful for people with ASD. If she's at home, she's not going to go to the effort of hiding her disorder because she's supposed to be around people who understand and respect her differences.", "Complete speculation - but she may have wanted to move out log ago and hates the living situation. You are 100% correct that she shouldn't be an AH, bit living w/ that may people maybe hard on her and the brother refusing to move may have just made her resent OP and family. That doesn't excuse her behavior, but \"we have the top floor to ourselves\" may have been the brother's only argument in keeping her there.\n\nIt really sounds like it is best for everyone if OP's brother moves out.", "Yes, can be that or, I'm speculating too, the brother and his wife think OP bought the house below market value and resent him.", "I\u2019m stuck on the cats needing their own room for their litter box. I\u2019ve got three cats. There are three litter boxes, two are in my bedroom. I buy high quality litter and carefully clean the boxes daily. There is no odor. Why would cats need a separate room? Your brother and SIL are being ridiculous, and if they choose to move out over this, then it\u2019s on them, not you!", "You are tah .

I thought at first maybe you needed the extra room he was in. NTA at all. You need help with your child and a live in nanny will be SO helpful to you guys following the loss of your dad. Tell them to deal with it or find somewhere else to live. It\u2019s hard but it\u2019s your house. Sorry you have to deal with this though, it sucks", "NTA. Honestly, I can several scenarios where your SIL doesn\u2019t interact with the helper, but your brother is being an immense AH. Let him move out and don\u2019t feel bad as you\u2019re not doing anything wrong.", "NTA. It sounds like your 2 families just aren\u2019t compatible anyway and both of you would be more comfortable living apart.  Look at it as more of a win for everyone.", "Nta so they pay no rent no mortgage and no taxes but think they are entitled to use 3 out of 4 bedrooms? This was never going to work long term. I would never allow anyone that openly hates children near my child.", "Nta. Sounds like its time.", "NTA. As he said, it's your house. If they are both late twenties and working, they should be finding their own place. If they're not working they could help your wife more and then this situation wouldn't have arisen.\n\nI don't think it would work to just use the room for your child, the cats won't respect boundaries after the time they have had rights over the room, and your relationship with your brother and his wife sounds dysfunctional already, so if he holds a grudge, what did you really lose?", "NTA. It sounds like your dad was only telling you to stick together because he spent his life enabling your brother. His demand was for you to take on the mantle of caretaker since he would no longer be able to do it. It is not your job to take care of your adult brother and his wife when for real, they are outsiders living in your house.\n\nIf you were renting those rooms to strangers, it would make sense to them not taking care of your kid and not talking to you really. But family members choosing to live a separate life from you, in your house, it's weird. And it's not something that works for you. it doesn't work for you and your wife to have two people who live in your house who have such emotional leverage over you, that don't treat you with basic respect.\n\nIt's good that they are leaving, because it sounds like the life balance that they want is living in their own place where they can walk around naked and have a separate room for a litter box. They need to go find that", "NTA. Time for bro and wife to get their own space. You helped them long enough.", "Nta", "INFO: does brother pay rent?", "And I would like to say this again, whatever responsibilities your father chose to take up, are not things you are required to do. Your father chose to house your brother and his wife and have them living their own separate life on the second floor, but that isn't a life that works for you and your family.", "Just because she can do it doesn't mean she can do it as much or as often as you think she should be able to.\n\nI'd go with believing her limitations and needs are real and are whatever she says they are (not what he says they are). Unfortunately for everyone, her needs simply don't match up well with living in a house with a growing child. That doesn't make her bad, but it does make it necessary to find different living arrangements, and since this is your house, they should have been working on that from the moment they found out your baby was on the way.", "Seriously, it makes me so nuts especially when people in the spirit of being accommodating except the excuse. Like she's being rude and expressing that she wants to live in a house with just her husband and her cats. Instead of going and doing that work, she's just been a real pill.\n\nShe knows what she's been doing, she just really doesn't care enough about the poster and his wife to care that she's being rude to them. It's good they're finally going to move out", "This is a good point. Probably the best point, actually. Set aside the fact that there is no talk of two grown people living in the house paying for any rent or utilities (or did I miss it?), a baby is not a baby forever. They begin to move and ask questions. While the child could live in there room for a few years, feasibly, how were they going to handle the fact that there is someone in the house who \"hates\" children? Kids pick up on being hated really quickly.\n\nNTA, op.", "Sounds to me them having an apartment all to themselves would help BIL's wife also. I can't imagine being stuck in just three rooms all the time with no access to the kitchen or living room and knowing that at any time my privacy might be interrupted by someone walking up the stairs. I mean I don't really like going places either but I'd feel so trapped.", "I think assuming all social interaction is masking is also a leap. I've lived with multiple other autistic adults ( myself included) and none of them completely avoid interactions at home. Most of us like socializing, we just might have different requirements for it. We don't know what is actually going on re: brother's wife not talking to OP + family, only the brother's wife knows her reasoning/ needs.", "The only thing you and I are in agreement on is that it's good they're moving.", "\"Her charms\". Don't act like that. You are in the right for the post itself, but let's not act like your brother's behavior is anyone's fault but his own. The person you are talking to above seems to have no fucking idea how autism works and you are disturbingly happy to accept their views regarding it.", "Yeah that's the real point here, if she finds it so fatiguing to have interaction with people who aren't her husband and her cats at home, they need to live by themselves.", "But this isn't about you and the people you know. This is about OP's SIL. There's no reason for anyone to accuse her of faking or exaggerating because there are definitely autistic people who can only comfortably communicate with particular people. That's even true for allistic people with selective mutism. If she's only comfortable with certain people right now, she should be allowed to exist in peace. She isn't causing anyone any harm or being unduly disruptive. The only problem anyone has had with her has been that she doesn't interact with them.", "I agree that none of us can tell the extent of this being symptoms OR how much of this is just behavioural. But there's also a huge belief that autistic people don't like socializing at all, which is also a false stigma. The main problem about this whole situation is when you live with other people you do actually have to interact with people. Housing issues need communication. Households break down without communication. That is the effective basis of this post. If she doesn't want verbal communication it can be done in other ways if needed. text to speech/ notes/ emails. But for a household to be functional there does need to be open communication lines.As for harms: yes the adults would be fine, but I would also argue completely ignoring a child can do a mild amount of developmental damage to a child if you live in the same space as them based on standard attachment ideas. If her needs require her to only interact with certain people it would be better to create a housing situation that organically supports it. That way everyone has needs met.", "I never said that OP's brother and SIL shouldn't move out. That does seem like the best solution. I only ever argued against the people who are accusing SIL of faking/exaggerating so that she can be rude and use autism as an excuse.\n\nAnd of course the stigma that autistic people don't want any socialization is false, but that doesn't mean that this particular autistic person doesn't care for socialization. Whether that stims from ASD or some kind of antisocial disorder, it should be respected. And she has been communicating at least somewhat, because she spoke during the funeral", "I feel like this has at least in part been an argument of semantics. We both agree that you cannot attribute an intent behind the asocial behavior of the wife. OP made an assumption that it was done callously. You've asserted ( correctly) that there can be a harmless reason for it. I have further stated that we as outsiders cannot work out the motivation behind a behavior- only the person doing it can. \n\nI'm just a bit over focused on household logistics so I approached it from that angle. ( off topic but I suspect op just mis- substituted asocial for antisocial. Antisocial disorders are linked to violent behaviours, asocial is a lack or avoidance of social interaction)"]}
