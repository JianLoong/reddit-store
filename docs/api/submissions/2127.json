She's got mild autism and some antisocial tendencies, i.e. she can only interact with my brother and their 4 cats. She never speaks to me nor my wife, and doesn't acknowledge my kid as she hates babies. \n\nWe were living somewhat happily with each of us occupying a level for ourselves. My dad has the hall as he was partially debilitated (bro and i would help him whenever he calls us), i took the master bedroom level for my family, and my brother and his wife occupied the top level. \n\nToday:\nDad died in October, leaving my bro and I. My father in law offered us a helper to help take care of our baby since the baby is super active and demands our attention and time. Wife's been struggling to handle the baby by herself and needs my constant support. A helper will greatly help take a load off our shoulders, as my wife can work and i can start to find a better paying job. \n\nBased on the house layout, logically the choice would be to utilize the 1 extra room for the helper. \n\nWhen i spoke to my brother, he flipped. He said the top level has always been his. Him and his wife walk around in boxers and panties and they cant do that anymore, making them uncomfortable. Since that room is also used to house the cats poo, the cats wont have anywhere else to poo. And brother's wife will just stay in her room as she is deathly afraid of other people. Because of this, he will have to move out, and he will do so within these few months. But not before making me feel like a total AH, as he said he will F Off and i will be free to do anything i want since it's my home (his words, not mine). \n\nAs an added guilt trip, our dad before he passed, told us to always stick together and be around for each other, so that we wont be estranged like him and his brother before us. And only about a month after his death, we are already planning to split up, making me feel absolutely shitty. \n\nSome context - my bro and I were really close since we were kids. Our mom died when i was 12, and he was 8. However things got strained between us when he got married..he seemed to take on his wife's persona and became more reclusive rather than helping his wife overcome her social anxiety.

It is your house and your brother and sister in law dont sound as if they contribute much. If youre worried that you arent sticking together, is there a possible compromise? Do you truly need a live in helper? Could your helper just come over for part of the day? You would get help, and surely an extra person in the home would make them realize how things are changing while reminding them that this is YOUR house and time for them to make other arrangements in the near future. This is a slower process, but less stress on your relationship with your brother.", "NTA - it\u2019s your property. Does your brother even pay you rent and utilities?", "NTA.  I'd help him pack up and move out of YOUR house.  His problem on where to live.  His wife would be better off in their own home IMO since she can't stand babies or people around her.  In fact,  you would be doing them a favor by them moving and getting their own personal space <eg>", "Just try to be nice in the mean time.\n\nSounds like this can\u2019t go on forever.\n\nMaybe sincerely try to help him with the new place, ask if he\u2019d want help with a realtor maybe.\n\nIf you own a home, there are lots of ways you could help him, (if you choose) but maybe also try to help them think about positives.\n\nThey may end up with a whole house where they can walk around nude, and a garage or more spaces for the cats to play.\n\nYou can stay together more closely while being further apart than you\u2019d be able to while cramping each others style.\n\nEventually your kid will need that room and they may not be the last one.\n\nEveryone needs space.", "I guess my late dad was partly to blame, he was always the 'baby' of the family while i was always the one that advocated tough love. I was always viewed as the evil one, not wanting to freely help him so that he learns the ropes of life himself. But his choice of words stung the most i guess. I spoke diplomatically and he was shouting at the top of his lungs. It was sad for me.", "Plus, his wife is using her being in the spectrum to be rude. If she has high-functioning autism she's able to interact with others. She's choosing not to. Yes, she can be \"awkward\" around others, and she can have social anxiety but a lot of people do and that doesn't make them AHs. She's choosing to be rude to the people giving her a place to live and their baby. She can do better than that, even if she needs to step a bit out of her comfort zone.", "Well, to be brutally honest I'm not fortunate to afford live in care... my Father in Law who loves his first grandchild is sponsoring her costs on a month to month basis. All i have to do is to make sure the helper has a comfortable place to live. And my brother's outburst is making things complicated, especially since it's only been a month since my dad passed...", "Well he pays half of the utilities.. other than that its all on me. The title to the house has my name on it. It's just that he stayed on as my dad wanted us all to be together, and he can't afford to buy his own house (house prices in my country are through the roof). So he will have to rent a place.\n\nHe has been married to his wife for the past 6 years. I can count the number of times we interact. I mean my brother at least tries to talk to me but his wife just keeps to herself and actively avoids people. I got married in 2020 and she only spoke to my wife on, like, 3 occasions to ask my wife to shut the windows so the cats wont jump out..\n\nWhen i told him his wife has issues and he should get her checked, he flat out denied and said she's absolutely fine and that's just the way she is.. so yeah... there's that.", "We have no lease. Its just a 'social contract' of sorts as we are Asians and culturally there's an element of familial bond where we try to stick together where we can. I tried my best to uphold my dad's wishes since I'm the only family he's got, but it's getting awfully difficult to do so with a growing kid (and potentially more to come)", "It is fully mine. My name is on the title, just that he has been living in since before I bought the house from my dad. Mind you, we don't stay in America (Asian BTW) so the laws aren't as cut and dry for occupancy and tenancy. As i said in other replies, he only pays half of the utilities. The rest of the utilities, mortgage, land taxes, etc are on me.\n\nIf its any consolation, I did tell him that the house is always available for him if shit hits the fan out there (retrenchment exercises, etc) but he has to accept the conditions as they are. I guess its just the timing being so soon from my dad's passing that makes me feel shitty that he is moving out.", "What about giving the helper dad\u2019s old room? I know that may be an unpopular opinion but it is something to consider.", "Only half of the utilities. The mortgage, yearly taxes, remaining half of the utilities are on me.", "I always suspected this, she can speak perfectly if the need arises. On my dad's funeral all my aunts and uncles came from far away places and she spoke normally. So i suspect she just chose not to interact with my wife and i, and keep things to herself. She has been married to my brother for 6 years and i have barely any interaction with her.", "The timing is indeed unfortunate.  That said, the timing was not a matter of choice on your part.", "I think it sounds like dad was in a corridor type hall space, so possibly not private enough for an external/unrelated person", "The dad did not have a room. He lived in the foyer it sounds like.", "Then do what is best for you. Your child is a baby now, but when they get older they will wonder why the person in the ceiling won't engage with them.", "You might have your answer then.", "You're right. He had a teak bed that he just layed on in the hall. It is an open space. It was most convenient as the toilet is a few steps away and he had the TV and the kitchen nearby. Everything was within arm's reach since he was not able to walk by himself up to the point of his passing, so the hall would have been out of the question, as the helper would definitely need her own private space to rest after a long day to care for my demanding child...", "Fair point on the child's development. While my brother at least tries to interact with his nephew whom i can see he sincerely loves, his wife just does not give a shit. And when i asked if they can help if i choose to not have a nanny, he admitted that they couldnt care for the child if my wife and i had to work. I guess it's more on the sentiment of late dad's wishes that tugs at my heartstrings more than anything, making me feel like the AH...", "But my brother doesnt see this. Unfortunately he seems to have been sucked in by her charms and there's really nothing i can do about it. I love him dearly but his wife is driving a wedge between us. And i guess the worst part is the timing of this as it's happening so soon after my dad passed.", "I get that not everyone is kid minded. That is fair. You and your wife obviously need help with your baby which is completely fair. I'm a teacher. I work with kids all day, but give me a baby and I'll run for the hills. That being said I won't begrudge someone getting help with said baby. They can go walk around half naked in their own place. Your dad's wishes does not mean you have to be your brother's keeper for the rest of your life. What if you have more kids? If you guys can afford a nanny then go for it.  You need to think about your baby, your wife and yourself.", "Ultimately it's your brother's choice. Plus, I doubt he doesn't see it. He must know his wife doesn't like you guys because he probably sees she can talk freely outside the house when they go out.\n\nThere must be a reason why she doesn't like you and your family but your brother doesn't wanna tell you.", "That is true. As much as he is prioritising his wife, i should too. I guess i am too hard on myself for trying to be the glue that keeps us together.\n\nAs for the baby, wife and I have sworn that the kid will have no screen time till he is 2. In my country it's all too common to see babies fixated on phone/tablet/tv screens, leading to behavioral/developmental issues. I can see why its convenient, but as a result of this, the baby is constantly exploring, demanding our attention and just wants to play. Hence more care and attention is needed for the little one.", "Good for you. Being the glue is exhausting. I know. Also and this is from years of experience get your child a puppy when they are old enough to not want to gnaw on it because they will just be each other's best friends and keep each other busy. Screen time can be a good thing when it is an interactive programme, but in moderation of course. Avoid cocomelon too much.", "NTA\n\nInfo, is your brother paying fair market rent for 3 bedrooms in your area?", "Nta", "INFO: Can\u2019t you just swap levels? So brother and wife have the master bedroom level and you and wife and baby have the top level?", "NTA it's your house your rules.  Your brother and his wife need to grow up and move out and be adults.\nYou have been more then accommodating with them.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU bought the house. So use it. IF your brother can not accept it, let him move out. Where is the threat in that?", "NTA I\u2019m afraid your dad was a bit \n\nYou must stay together all times despite his wife having extreme anxiety disorder", "NTA but could a compromise be a helper that is not live in?", "Love when people baselessly accuse autistic people of faking/exaggerating their symptoms just to be assholes. There isn't enough misinformation surrounding ASD, so it's good to sprinkle some where we can. They should mask all the time lest we find their existence inconvenient.", "If it makes you feel any better, this was going to happen eventually.\n\nSure, right now your 9 month old baby can stay on your floor, but eventually, your child was going to need their own room, and would've needed to move up to the third floor, at which point your brother would probably have gotten just as mad as he is now.", "Unfortunately your family is growing and you need to make adjustments for that. It\u2019s unfair that your brother feels he\u2019s entitled to 3/4 of the bedrooms in \u201c your\u201d home. What happens when your baby also needs a room.", "It's called masking, and it's very stressful for people with ASD. If she's at home, she's not going to go to the effort of hiding her disorder because she's supposed to be around people who understand and respect her differences.", "Complete speculation - but she may have wanted to move out log ago and hates the living situation. You are 100% correct that she shouldn't be an AH, bit living w/ that may people maybe hard on her and the brother refusing to move may have just made her resent OP and family. That doesn't excuse her behavior, but \"we have the top floor to ourselves\" may have been the brother's only argument in keeping her there.\n\nIt really sounds like it is best for everyone if OP's brother moves out.", "Yes, can be that or, I'm speculating too, the brother and his wife think OP bought the house below market value and resent him.", "I\u2019m stuck on the cats needing their own room for their litter box. I\u2019ve got three cats. There are three litter boxes, two are in my bedroom. I buy high quality litter and carefully clean the boxes daily. There is no odor. Why would cats need a separate room? Your brother and SIL are being ridiculous, and if they choose to move out over this, then it\u2019s on them, not you!", "You are tah .

I thought at first maybe you needed the extra room he was in. NTA at all. You need help with your child and a live in nanny will be SO helpful to you guys following the loss of your dad. Tell them to deal with it or find somewhere else to live. It\u2019s hard but it\u2019s your house. Sorry you have to deal with this though, it sucks", "NTA. Honestly, I can several scenarios where your SIL doesn\u2019t interact with the helper, but your brother is being an immense AH. Let him move out and don\u2019t feel bad as you\u2019re not doing anything wrong.", "NTA. It sounds like your 2 families just aren\u2019t compatible anyway and both of you would be more comfortable living apart.  Look at it as more of a win for everyone.", "Nta so they pay no rent no mortgage and no taxes but think they are entitled to use 3 out of 4 bedrooms? This was never going to work long term. I would never allow anyone that openly hates children near my child.", "Nta. Sounds like its time.", "NTA. As he said, it's your house. If they are both late twenties and working, they should be finding their own place. If they're not working they could help your wife more and then this situation wouldn't have arisen.\n\nI don't think it would work to just use the room for your child, the cats won't respect boundaries after the time they have had rights over the room, and your relationship with your brother and his wife sounds dysfunctional already, so if he holds a grudge, what did you really lose?", "NTA. It sounds like your dad was only telling you to stick together because he spent his life enabling your brother. His demand was for you to take on the mantle of caretaker since he would no longer be able to do it. It is not your job to take care of your adult brother and his wife when for real, they are outsiders living in your house.\n\nIf you were renting those rooms to strangers, it would make sense to them not taking care of your kid and not talking to you really. But family members choosing to live a separate life from you, in your house, it's weird. And it's not something that works for you. it doesn't work for you and your wife to have two people who live in your house who have such emotional leverage over you, that don't treat you with basic respect.\n\nIt's good that they are leaving, because it sounds like the life balance that they want is living in their own place where they can walk around naked and have a separate room for a litter box. They need to go find that", "NTA. Time for bro and wife to get their own space. You helped them long enough.", "Nta", "INFO: does brother pay rent?", "And I would like to say this again, whatever responsibilities your father chose to take up, are not things you are required to do. Your father chose to house your brother and his wife and have them living their own separate life on the second floor, but that isn't a life that works for you and your family.", "Just because she can do it doesn't mean she can do it as much or as often as you think she should be able to.\n\nI'd go with believing her limitations and needs are real and are whatever she says they are (not what he says they are). Unfortunately for everyone, her needs simply don't match up well with living in a house with a growing child. That doesn't make her bad, but it does make it necessary to find different living arrangements, and since this is your house, they should have been working on that from the moment they found out your baby was on the way.", "Seriously, it makes me so nuts especially when people in the spirit of being accommodating except the excuse. Like she's being rude and expressing that she wants to live in a house with just her husband and her cats. Instead of going and doing that work, she's just been a real pill.\n\nShe knows what she's been doing, she just really doesn't care enough about the poster and his wife to care that she's being rude to them. It's good they're finally going to move out", "This is a good point. Probably the best point, actually. Set aside the fact that there is no talk of two grown people living in the house paying for any rent or utilities (or did I miss it?), a baby is not a baby forever. They begin to move and ask questions. While the child could live in there room for a few years, feasibly, how were they going to handle the fact that there is someone in the house who \"hates\" children? Kids pick up on being hated really quickly.\n\nNTA, op.", "Sounds to me them having an apartment all to themselves would help BIL's wife also. I can't imagine being stuck in just three rooms all the time with no access to the kitchen or living room and knowing that at any time my privacy might be interrupted by someone walking up the stairs. I mean I don't really like going places either but I'd feel so trapped.", "I think assuming all social interaction is masking is also a leap. I've lived with multiple other autistic adults ( myself included) and none of them completely avoid interactions at home. Most of us like socializing, we just might have different requirements for it. We don't know what is actually going on re: brother's wife not talking to OP + family, only the brother's wife knows her reasoning/ needs.", "The only thing you and I are in agreement on is that it's good they're moving.", "\"Her charms\". Don't act like that. You are in the right for the post itself, but let's not act like your brother's behavior is anyone's fault but his own. The person you are talking to above seems to have no fucking idea how autism works and you are disturbingly happy to accept their views regarding it.", "Yeah that's the real point here, if she finds it so fatiguing to have interaction with people who aren't her husband and her cats at home, they need to live by themselves.", "But this isn't about you and the people you know. This is about OP's SIL. There's no reason for anyone to accuse her of faking or exaggerating because there are definitely autistic people who can only comfortably communicate with particular people. That's even true for allistic people with selective mutism. If she's only comfortable with certain people right now, she should be allowed to exist in peace. She isn't causing anyone any harm or being unduly disruptive. The only problem anyone has had with her has been that she doesn't interact with them.", "I agree that none of us can tell the extent of this being symptoms OR how much of this is just behavioural. But there's also a huge belief that autistic people don't like socializing at all, which is also a false stigma. The main problem about this whole situation is when you live with other people you do actually have to interact with people. Housing issues need communication. Households break down without communication. That is the effective basis of this post. If she doesn't want verbal communication it can be done in other ways if needed. text to speech/ notes/ emails. But for a household to be functional there does need to be open communication lines.As for harms: yes the adults would be fine, but I would also argue completely ignoring a child can do a mild amount of developmental damage to a child if you live in the same space as them based on standard attachment ideas. If her needs require her to only interact with certain people it would be better to create a housing situation that organically supports it. That way everyone has needs met.", "I never said that OP's brother and SIL shouldn't move out. That does seem like the best solution. I only ever argued against the people who are accusing SIL of faking/exaggerating so that she can be rude and use autism as an excuse.\n\nAnd of course the stigma that autistic people don't want any socialization is false, but that doesn't mean that this particular autistic person doesn't care for socialization.

Or maybe they're just having a good day. \n\nYou might be tempted to call an autistic who is super good at quantum physics \"high-functioning\", but what if they don't know how to make a sandwich, drive a car, shop for groceries, etc? Are they still \"high-functioning\"? I would say that the lack of basic life skills would indicate that the autistic person has quite high support needs. \n\nYou might be tempted to call an autistic who has reading & maths skills at a 1st-grade level \"low-functioning\". But what if they are really attuned to those they love and instinctively know how to provide comfort in trying times? What if they can remember all their favourite actors and every movie they've been in and recite it to you by heart? What if they have the practical skills to live independently? \n\nAnd please remember, the main reason autistics have difficulty functioning in this world is because it's built by neurotypicals for neurotypicals.

If your brother wants a private residence with no room mates, he can go do that.", "NTA, sticking by each other and supporting each other doesn't mean your brother forever lives in your home with his own floor, especially when his wife is so anti-social she cant even interact with the family who's house she lives in. \n\nI have a few questions, I dont seem to understand what you mean when you say hall and mini hall, is that to mean hallway or a open space? What if the helper stays where your dad stayed?", "NTA. It\u2019s time for your brother to grow up\n And stop depending on you for housing.", "Wife can\u2019t handle a 9 mo. old? Anyone else see this as odd? I mean, husband provides \u201cconstant\u201d support, who wouldn\u2019t want a nanny? Good for you princess. No comment about the rest. Of course bro has to move.", "Why can't the helper just come part of the time? Is it really necessary to have a live-in helper? I feel like a compromise is to just let the helper come during the time your wife needs the most help. That way your brother can stay and you can still be free to get a better job.\n\nNAH, imo. I understand why you both feel as you do. I also understand that your dad's wishes were for you two to stick together. This would allow for that. Good luck.", "YTA. While the split might be eventually inevitable - and it is your house and your choice to do what you want with it - I don\u2019t understand why the helper cannot live in the hall, like your father did? As long as they have privacy - since you/r family  doesn\u2019t live there, it should be fine. Unless there is some cultural nuance that I am missing.\nOne more thing - about brother not (being) able to help his wife become more social, autism is not about a bad temperament that he can help her improve or overcome.", "Is the 1st floor to small to live in?", "OP had me at four cats. No. Your wife, your kid and your four cats? No. That's too much for me.", "Omg that\u2019s not true or real. I\u2019m autistic and that\u2019s not at all what it means. It literally means no speech or learning disabilities which is why the autistic community is advocating to get it changed but it has NOTHING to do with how social you are.", "It doesn't sound like he's paid rent in a while.  Although I understand you feel bad, why was he not saving all this time that he has been living rent free?", "That\u2019s not accurate. Please see my answer above. That\u2019s not what functioning labels means and why they\u2019re useless. They only mean no speech or ID. Has nothing to do with how well you socialize or your anxiety. And we, as autistic people, deserve to be BELIEVED when we articulate our boundaries. You can dislike her needs and set your own boundaries but it\u2019s really ableist to not believe her.", "Yup, came here to say this \u2b06\ufe0f", "Lol. All our lives everyone\u2019s mad at us because we don\u2019t have charm, and here you are. You can be mad at your brother but maybe you could have bothered to learn a little about autism.", "I\u2019m aware. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cool to bitch at the people housing you - for free - because then, they\u2019d both have to wear clothes AND they\u2019d have to have litter boxes in one of the other rooms. They were doing the brother and SIL a pretty big favor\u2026now they\u2019ve rescinded that offer. Being autistic is not an excuse to be an asshole, especially when everyone is grieving and someone is coming to help out for a bit. Having anxiety, depression, whatever, aren\u2019t either. I have major issues with anxiety around people, and one of the ways I deal with it is to find housing situations without roommates - of course, if it was roommates or no room at all, I\u2019m going with the former, but I\u2019d at least be civil - greet people, maybe a bit of small talk if I\u2019m feeling good. Hell, my partner is on the spectrum, she\u2019s got some social phobias and awkwardness, but she managed to be civil to the housemates she lived with, even after finding out about THEIR phobias when she got given notice: to vacate out of nowhere. It was just part of living with others, family or not. \n\n\ntl;dr: if the people housing you for free need the room your cats shit in, you move the litter boxes and deal for a bit or you move out.", "Who knows, maybe the separation will be good for your relationship in the long run.", "Gross. Your one of those people using methods based on observing us to discount our actual lived experience. Stop talking over marginalized groups who are articulating our own lived experiences. Stop. Stop. Stop. This is gross.", "We really do not know if they are renting  or not, he did not say, but assume they are paying something.     Second, he feels it is rude because she does not talk to them.  But she is not verbal.  He did say she was talking at the funeral.   If you ask an autistic person a question they will answer it, but they do not initiate a conversation.   The person I know, is like that.", "I find that you need to talk initiate a conversation.   Also an autistic person can have anxiety problems being around a lot of people.", "And some of us are okay with not talking that much to begin with.", "NTA. We're you just going to keep your child in your room it's entire life even tho you have 3 more full bedrooms you were just...... giving to two people who sleep in (I'm assuming) one room together? \nThey are entitled. Let them leave on whatever terms they want. Cats don't need their own bedroom. Your child and any helper tho sure will. Don't let yourself be guilted by needing to provide more for your own family. Maybe if they didn't hate your kid so much and weren't afraid of people they live with and would help out some, they wouldn't have to leave.

If he wants to move out of the housing you provide for free because he doesn\u2019t want you to use your own spare room, that\u2019s on him and is no reason for you to feel guilty.

Your brother\u2019s reasons for not wanting someone to use the other room is bogus. The helper/nanny isn't going to be up there all day, cats can have their box moved a bit, and per his wife? No clue. Its not like you were kicking him out, but adding another person to help out. So yeah, your brother is being kind of a brat.", "NTA\n\nI think your reason to hire a helper are suspicious. You really dont struggle with taking care of a baby when you are not working, very much less require additional support. \n\nI agree that hiring a helper can free up wife and allow her to work and bring in more income, which makes sense. \n\nI dont quite understand why the helper cant have dad's old room which is empty now that he has passed. \n\nRegardless, its your room and you decide who is welcome. Im not quite sure if brother is paying in the first place, but even if he does, it seems like you are giving him appropriate time to move out. so NTA", "NTA. Asian also. Also, it wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your brother doesn\u2019t move out like he said he would. Once he realizes there are real life consequences he might change his mind.", "A cat-poo room - yikes. Expect surprises when they leave. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour father\u2019s wishes are not the same as a legal obligation. \n\nBeing there for each other works both ways. \n\nA room for cats to piss and shit in does not sound like optimum use of a space. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that it used to be the family home, it is now your family home. \n\nIt\u2019s sad, but your brother is taking advantage.

Super brave though.", "Well the main hall is a large rectangular space plus a dining area and a kitchen. The mini hall is a smaller space outside the master bedroom with space for a single sofa. \n\nWhile my dad was alive, visitors would come to the mini hall and chill at the sofa as my dad was occupying the hall. I must say we had not much visitors during the time my dad was alive, we met people outside.\n\nI replied in other comments, it can be a stopgap measure where i set up temporary partitions for the helper.

A bit hard to explain without pictures though.", "The hall has no room. It's an open space. My house has 3 levels and my dad was in no condition to climb up any stairs (believe me, we tried. He weighed above 200lbs and my bro and i struggled to get him through a flight of stairs). The hall was the most convenient to place dad, as he could only walk 10-15 steps to the toilet to bathe and no.2. plus the hall had a tv which he watched for entertainment, and a dining table which dad could eat at.\n\nNow think about it. Would the helper be comfortable staying in an open space exposed to everyone? I guess it could work in the short term i.e. for a month or two where we partition the place up with boards, but if this is gonna be long term, she will definitely need her own room for her own space and privacy.", "Or once he leaves, he cant take the pressure and added complexity of managing a house all by himself and his wife, and come back.

OP admits he doesn\u2019t really know much. There are plenty of autistic people who can speak physically but not practically if they have other sensory or social issues that make it difficult to get their mouth to do what their brain wants it to do.

Your dad wanted you and your brother to be there for each other, but I\u2019m not seeing any examples of your brother being there for you. He hasn\u2019t chipped in for the house, but continues to live there _and expect to exert authority over 1/3 of the property._ Hks interpretation of the situation is that as the younger brother, he gets to take and take and take, while you are expected to give and give and give. \n\nA decent sibling would ask how long you expect to have the helper around, if that space is so important to them, ask what he and his wife can do to pick up the slack so that you don\u2019t need to hire a helper. But your brother expects to continue using that space without contributing to the household and to shame you for decisions that he made and is making. You didn\u2019t throw your brother out. He is choosing to move out because he is insulted that you are exerting your legal right over your home to use the rooms as you see fit. He is probably pissed that you are the sole owner of the property, but that\u2019s his own fault for not buying into the house when your dad was forced to sell. He is the one who fell in love with and married a woman with crippling mental issues. Her disabilities are hers and his to handle, not yours.

The government healthcare is... Adequate, but not the best. But it works, i guess.", "I mean, i could have been super mean and just told him to pack his bags but he's my bro. I still had a modicum of civility when i could just be as hostile as him and let things escalate..", "Fair point. I guess he was using the cash to live in relative luxury with his wife.

Its pure speculation at this point as to what SIL is facing. So honestly we do not know what she is facing.\n\nWhen I told my bro to get her checked by experts so they can ascertain what the issue is, he adamantly denied any issues and insisted that there is no problem and she's fine, its just the way she is.

Thanks for clearing it up, assuming it is, in fact, autism since there was no formal certification of her situation.", "Well we took it seriously by never bothering them. Giving them their space. Letting them live their own lives. Even though they were staying under one roof, on separate levels. Things got heated only when i had to utilize one room of the house to house a helper.

Brother is trying to guilt trip but he's the one putting in the deadlines and making ultimatums.", "Boom. That's what was bothering me about the whole scenario. If there's no documentation, there's been no formal diagnosis, and sadly, it seems as if sil is following a very disgusting trend of appropriating an actual ( for lack of better term I can't remember atm) illness so that she can be a narcissistic whinyass. You're not the asshole, and honestly, I'd give them a time frame in which they need to be gone. Make sure they clean and disinfect your entire top floor as well.", "Fingers crossed it's for the best for all of us. Will update this space in months to come \ud83d\ude42", "I would love to see you tell an oncologist they don\u2019t know shit because they\u2019ve never had cancer.", "This is not how classifying autism works. It's not all about excelling or not academically. It's about how self-sufficient and how able to communicate a person is (or might be).\n\nAnyway, OP said that SIL didn't have a formal assessment, she self-diagnosed herself. If that is true and OP's brother is truly worried about it she must seek a formal assessment, by a real expert in the field. \n\nIf she is diagnosed with ASD she can seek help because being locked in her bedroom every single day until midnight is not healthy for any of them, but especially her. But as far as we know she can have ASD or not. She can be extremely anxious without having ASD.", "Lol. Okay. I\u2019m sure your degrees are worth more than my bring an autistic person with 3 degrees myself. Nope on out of here with your inability to listen to us.", "See that\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re making it about you. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about her. Often women don\u2019t find out we\u2019re autistic until we hit what\u2019s called autistic burnout. I didn\u2019t know until my 40s. So while I have 3 degrees and have done a great deal in my field, I\u2019m currently at my parents house and I haven\u2019t left the house in 6 months. I just don\u2019t have the spoons (look up spoon theory). It will help you, I think, to reframe this. It\u2019s NOT about you. She may be embarrassed to ask you to change the food smells or the amount of artwork on the wall or the lighting may be loud (yes this is a real thing). Because you\u2019re instinct has been to deny or dislike the whole topic, and probably because she\u2019s embarrassed she can\u2019t work, she\u2019s been unable or scared to ask for the sensory fixes. Autistic burnout is real and it\u2019s terrifying. I have days I can\u2019t physically move. \n\nI recommend the book \u201cunmasking autism\u201d by Devon price. Especially for late diagnosed autistics. \n\nAlso, just as an aside, my adult dx cost $3000. Out of pocket. My parents were kind enough to cover me but I could not have afforded that myself. The further you are from male, and white, the less likely you are to be diagnosed as a kid. Or, frankly, as an adult. And the reality is talk therapy can help but often it\u2019s not helpful for us. CBT can be an actual traumatic experience. Trauma therapy and DBT are better options, but harder to find. Avoid anything ABA based. That\u2019s basically conversion therapy (that\u2019s a real thing. Same guy invented it who invented gay conversion therapy). It\u2019s just trauma after trauma.\n\nAlso, maybe this will help. \n\nhttps://neuroclastic.com/its-a-spectrum-doesnt-mean-what-you-think/", "You mean students you subject to ABA? Yeah. We all know how badly that ends. But it\u2019s later so it doesn\u2019t mess with your numbers."]}
