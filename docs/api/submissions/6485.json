She rang earlier this week and asked me if I\u2019d be her bridesmaid. I said although I wish I could, we\u2019d need to talk about it because with my health problems I\u2019m not sure how practical it would be. \n\nI have neurological and heart problems. There are many days when I cannot even sit up, never mind go to a wedding. I\u2019m also immunosuppressed so I have to wear a mask in indoor shared spaces to avoid infection, especially covid. I have 3 surgeries coming up in spring (same time as her wedding). She knows all of this anyway but I tried explaining again because it was like she had forgotten. She wouldn\u2019t listen and kept yelling \u2018Will you do it?, Will you do it?\u2019 over and over again every time I tried to speak. Eventually I said no and she was clearly annoyed. Then she started trying to make me feel guilty, saying things like \u2018A good friend would say yes\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m so disappointed in you\u2019, \u2018This will ruin my wedding day\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re my best friend so you should be my bridesmaid\u2019 \u2018I have no one else to ask\u2019 etc. That last one is true because she has no other friends. I did try introducing her to other people but she\u2019s always been quite a demanding, controlling person and they soon got fed up with her. \n\nI feel like a horrible person for refusing but I think it would be far worse to agree to do it and then be too unwell on the day and have to let her down last minute. The worst part is, I can\u2019t even be sure I\u2019ll be well enough to go to the wedding at all, never mind as a bridesmaid. Also, I know she expects me to cancel my heart surgery if it clashes with her wedding and I\u2019m not willing to do that. It\u2019s too important to me.", "created_utc": 1672854458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1039v0q/aita_for_refusing_to_be_my_friends_bridesmaid/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're health and well being comes first.", "NTA. You were bringing up very real problems that you as a disabled person have and wanted to discuss accomodation. That is a normal thing for us (disabled people) to do. A good friend would listen to you and work with you rather than ignoring you ans speaking over you, then shaming you for refusing. She sounds like a bad friend.", "Obvious NTA your \u201cfriend\u201d is being dismissive and manipulative and threatening for no reason", "NTA. This person does not sound like too much of a friend if she thinks you should cancel ***heart surgery*** for her wedding and yelling at you and not listening to what your were saying.", "NTA!!! \n\nOP, this person you call your \"friend\" is anything but! She is manipulative, cruel, slefish, delusional, and just plain mean. For chrissake, she expects you to cancel your life-giving HEART SURGERY so you can instead spend the day bringing her champagne and taking pictures and toasting to how wonderful she is? \n\nThere is a reason this girl, who couldn't even be bothered to maintain the friendhsip over the years, has no one else to turn to. Block her. Move on. And know in your heart that you have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.", "She doesn\u2019t sound like your friend. I guess she\u2019d rather watch you fall over and die in her cute matching bridesmaid dress than care about your health. NTA", "Omg defs not the asshole at all! Jesus pll are so fkn fickle! Like you're health n life is more important and a real friend wouldn't take it personally. You don't need bridesmaids honestly.......", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason she feels one of her only options is someone she hasn't really engaged with in years. She's not that valuable as a friend. She's being a bit self-centered. You shouldn't feel guilty for setting reasonable boundaries here.", "NTA You know your limitations and upcoming surgeries could affect your ability to be a part of the bridal party. It doesn't appear she's \"hearing\" you, or concerned about your health, and only thinking of how things will impact her if she's annoyed about it.", "NTA, obviously.\n\nI don't think anyone is ever an AH for declining to be in a wedding party.  In your case, you wouldn't be AH for having unexpected medical issues.  But since you already have procedures scheduled, and you have no idea whether you will be able to attend the wedding, let alone other bridesmaid duties, I think you would be AH to ACCEPT.\n\nAnd she didn't get to the details yet, but I'm sure she would have objected to you wearing a facemask during the ceremony.  And photos. Oh, and during the toasts.", "NTA.  Your health is more important.  I understand she thinks her wedding is more important, and to her it is which is fine, but you truly have to look out for yourself on this one.", "Nta hopefully you mean ex friend a true friend will care for their friends health and well being. Feel better op and good luck with surgery", "Her lack of social skills is not your issue. It is very unreasonable to expect you to grab this role and I get the feeling she would expect more work from you that just on the day. NTA. Protect yourself because she won't and that is not any kind of friend.", "Welp, it's no wonder she has no other friends. She expects you to postpone heart surgery for her wedding! Um, no. Stick to your decision. She's a nightmare. Take care of your health first and send them a lovely wedding gift if you're feeling generous.", "NTA, and I question why you continue to be friends with someone like this that shows 0% empathy and seems 100% selfish.  There is a reason why you are her only friend.  Your health comes first and it may be a healthy step to let natural consequences happen and this friendship to end.", "NTA. Sounds like she wouldn\u2019t have listened at all to the precautions you need to take to protect your health (wearing a mask indoors, can\u2019t function some days, prioritizing needed surgery)", "NTA.\n\nYou're not obligated and especially she comes across as being very ableist by directly ignoring and rejecting your actual physical issues. \n\nAnd absolutely ludicrous and absurd if she expects you to cancel HEART SURGERY for her wedding.\n\nThis is not a \"friend\", it's a super entitled and selfish AH.", "Gee, I wonder why she doesn\u2019t have any other friends? Hard NTA.", "NTA. She sure sounds like a demanding and controlling person. You need to put your health first, she's being a bridezilla. 'A good friend would say yes'. A good friend wouldn't try and make her friend put off HEART SURGERY for a wedding! Op, I hope your surgeries go well and you're not a bad person at all for putting yourself and your health first.", "NTA.  Your health concerns are enough of a reason to decline, because, as you said, you may end up having to bail at the last minute if you are not well enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, given how you make her sound, it would be a real chore to be a bridesmaid for her.  Being a bridesmaid (for most brides) is a real obligation.  Most brides expect their bridesmaids to plan a bridal shower, a bachelorette party, get them a gift, buy a very specific dress, get their hair/makeup/nails done a certain way, etc.  This will be, not only an obligation on the day of that you know you cannot keep, but also a large financial obligation.  Further, given how you said she is demanding and controlling, I imagine she will expect a lot out of those events.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis doesn't seem like it is worth the argument.  Tell her you have medical issues that may make it impossible for you to be out of bed around the time of her wedding and you would hate to disappoint her at the last minute.  Send her a nice gift (if you can afford it and want to) and don't go to the wedding if you don't want.  Good luck on your surgeries!", "You don\u2019t have to bend over backwards for anyone who has grown apart from you and has made no effort to keep the friendship alive or to communicate.\n\nDon\u2019t give into the manipulation, and don\u2019t give into the guilty feeling you\u2019re harboring right now. This is what she is counting on, and if you were to change your mind because you\u2019re feeling bad, she won\u2019t appreciate it because she believes she\u2019s right and that you *owe* her something.\n\nYou owe her nothing. It\u2019s her fault she has no friends, and with the way she treats other people, I hope she has no one standing next to her in the end.\n\nNTA.", "She sounds absolutely awful. Expecting you to reschedule your heart surgery...I am actually gobsmacked. Run for your life, literally. NTA", "NTA. Your health comes first, and there's a reason why she doesn't have any other friends, she clearly only cares about herself.", "\"I know she expects me to cancel my heart surgery if it clashes with her wedding\"\n\nNTA Just this. This is not a friend. It's not your fault she can't find someone else. She particularly should not be ignoring your health problems. Sounds like she expects you to sacrifice yourself for her.", "NTA.\n\nThis person is not your friend. She is just wa waiting to use you in her wedding because she has nobody else. Stop allowing folks like her into your life.", "NTA, it's an honour not an obligation.", "Big part of the reason me and my fianc\u00e9 are eloping,  I don\u2019t understand why people want some big deal made of a wedding. Surely it\u2019s just about the husband and wife? Why is such a fanfare needed?", "NTA. \nHas she even asked how you are doing? Especially with surgery coming up! \n\nMake sure friendships are balanced x", "OP, think of it this way: By denying her request (which you absolutely have to do), you're giving her the opportunity to face the fact she has no friends whatsoever. That's a very valuable realization. She might just decide people suck or that they're all too jealous of her or any of the other 100 rationalizations people like her use, but at least she has the opportunity to recognize she has issues that keep her from having even one friend. \n\nI feel sorry for the groom. The personal qualities that make it impossible for someone to have friends also make it impossible to have a happy marriage.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou weren't talking to a friend, because no actual friend would expect you to even attend as a guest considering your condition.", "NTA.  If you did do it and then had a problem of some kind, she'd still blame you for ruining the wedding.", "NTA - And if she's demanding you cancel your heart surgery just for HER wedding, is she really a friend you want to keep around? She's completely dismissing your health for her own happiness.", "NTA. How can anyone expect you to cancel heart surgery for a wedding that we all know is going to end in divorce in 2 years when her hubs gets sick of her BS?", "NTA. Based on your description of the conversation it\u2019s pretty easy to see why she doesn\u2019t have anyone else to ask. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s a bad friend, you shouldn\u2019t put your health at risk for a wedding.

You may not have that kind of energy with your health issues and surgeries coming up. The ONLY reason she is asking you is because she wants a helper and for you to stand in the photos.
