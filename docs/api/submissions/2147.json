My husband and I have been married for 3 years, and we dated for 2 years before that. I was born and raised in the city. My husband grew up in a farm at the countryside. His family has a large farm and although we live in the city for work, we go to the farm often and try to help his family. \n\nAnyway, since I don't want to stay at home and send my husband alone, I'm trying to help even though I don't know much about farm things. As I said, I grew up in the city, I don't have the slightest knowledge of farm life, I'm still trying to learn but I can't do some things.\n\nFor example, when we go out on the field for pick fruit I find it difficult to stand because the ground is aimed. I'm constantly slipping and falling and frankly, I don't want to go into the fruit picking because of it. My husband keeps saying that I have to get used to it, it's not that aimed. Or when I fall he says \"you're okay, get up\" and laugh at me even if I get hurt.\n\nI'm not a person who likes to whine, or I'm not a person who says \"I grew up in the city, my nails are going to be chipped, I can't do these things\". Really, I'm trying to help from the heart, which I don't have to.\n\nMy husband has recently started comparing me to his mother. He says things like \"my mom is doing this, you should be able to do it too\" or \"look how good my mom is doing, you can't do it\".\n\nI've been joking about it for a long time but my heart is breaking at this point. Today we were talking in the car on our way to help out on the farm, and he said, \"My mom and I are not happy with what you're doing, get better or don't come at all.\"\n\nSo I briefly told him to pull over, and as I got off I told him to stay on the farm with his mother, that I don't have to do these chores, that it's not my career, and not to come home. He left me on the side of the road. \n\nNow he's texting me saying I'm an asshole, that's how he grew\n up and that I'm rude saying don't come home, AITAH?\n\nEdit: okay I have to make something clear. I'm not choking him with \"take me with you\" stuff. He insists that I should help and I should learn these things because we're married and farm life is a part of who he is. I suggested that I could stay behind and he refused it, several times.", "created_utc": 1668283763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yth1ao/aitah_for_telling_my_30f_husband_34m_not_to_come/", "score": 459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I suspect your husband is anticipating going back to the farm but from the post it doesn\u2019t sound like you are. I hope two can figure out a way forward together and that your husband realizes what a hole he is being", "NTA. I am literally a farmer. I do all kinds of farm chores on a regular basis. Some of them are easy for me, some of them aren't, but I don't expect someone else to be good at them in the same way I am any more than I expect to step behind the wheel of a city bus and know what I'm doing.\n\nOn top of that, you're not doing this all day every day, so you're literally not building the muscle memory that they have. AND to top it off, you are doing this FOR FREE and they are criticizing FREE HELP. If you're not doing it in a way which actively makes the work harder for other people, they can take several seats over there and shut up.\n\nThis isn't a case of you not being good enough. This is a case of your husband being a raging asshole - as is his mother, if she's saying this too. Frankly, dump them and find better friends, because this isn't because they're farm people; it's because they're ungrateful jerks.", "They are choosing beggars. Don't help. You are trying to learn and they are critical. So I would let him do these chores alone. Also you suggested you stay at home and he refused? He doesn't get to refuse. He is not yyour master. NTA.", "NTA / stop going to the farm!", "NTA farm life isn't for everyone and he shouldn't be comparing you to his mother because you're his wife not his mother and if he keeps it up tell him to go marry his mother.", "NTA - I grew up in the city.  He grew up working on farms.  We live in the country not on a farm. I love mowing. That\u2019s it. I won\u2019t work in the garden. I don\u2019t like dirt in my nails or shoes. He was on a trip early in our marriage and came home asked who pulled all the mums.  They were just greening and I thought they were weeds.  He\u2019s an ass and if he wanted a farmhand he should have married a farm girl.  Did he have you doing this before marriage?", "NTA. Let him stay with his mom if she\u2019s so great. He sounds pretty terrible, so I don\u2019t think it would be a loss for you.", "NAH, how dare he?!?!\n\n\"My mother and I think....\" Say, what? He is talking trash about  you with his mom.\n\nThey may know about  picking fruit  but they know nothing  about: family, loyalty, gratitude  or respect.\n\nI hope you go to a fun city event tonight.", "NTA", "Not to say he isn\u2019t being a complete ass, but why did you marry a farmer if you don\u2019t want to farm?", "Esh.... everyone's attitudes suc.... why not, sit down and talk about expectations, and then learn about what your husband does and the family farm?   I'm not sure what you mean by the ground is \"aimed\" Do you have the proper attire to work?  Makes a difference. \nYour attitude sux just bc ur a \"city girl\" didn't mean you can't learn and can't be involved. \nYour husband attitude sux bc he should want to show you how to do the things on the farm and show you slowly, not just assume you know. \nYour MIL sux bc she could also help show you the ropes.", "Couple's counseling isn't recommended for abusive relationships, and based on her description he absolutely is abusive. Points 1&2 are good though.", "THIS right here. OP,  You say your hubby wants you at the farm to learn to do farm things (as you can see I'm not a farm girl). But when you're there he's constantly criticizing and making fun of you. And he unfairly compares you to his mom who grew up on the farm. AND after all that tells you not to come. Like NOTHING is going to make this man happy.  Please think about this as you consider your future. NTA", "THIS, if hubby was a reasonable man. But based on OPs edit and comments, he expects her to go and learn to become a farmer like the rest of his family. This is clearly not OP's calling, and his solution to that is \"don't come.\" But its not like he's going to be happy with that either. He's not looking like a good person based on this post. OP is NTA at all.", "Ehhh, he left her on the side of the road and is being verbally abusive. It's generally not recommended to go to marriage or couple's counseling with an abuser because they can use the counseling to mess you up further. I would recommend OP gets counseling and ditches the abusive AH of a husband...", "And that is it easy enough to fix, if either of you change your mind.", "I reckon his mother is driving this. And they've been discussing her behind her back. Yuk.", "They probably mean the ground is sloped.\n\nWhich, for someone who is not used to doing work on a slope, even a small one, is going to be more of a problem than someone who is experienced at ot.", "[deleted]", "You are your own person and farming is not in you. If your husband wanted a farm girl he should have married a farm girl. Just because you are married to him doesn't mean you HAVE to do anything you don't want to do and your husband needs to learn he can't FORCE ANYONE to do anything they don't want to do. If he treats you this way, is he going to do the same to your kids? MAKE them do it? And what happens when your kids come home crying because \"they didn't do it right and daddy yelled at them\"? Just because your husband says \"jump\" doesn't mean you have to ask \"how high\". Just tell him to stop comparing you to his mother and to realize how hard you are trying to learn and be happy with that or you won't go at all and he can't FORCE you to go. If he does force you into the car to go, that's abuse ...call the cops.", "Where is it written that you have to? Have you sign it in a prenup contract? No? Than you don't have to do anything.

He's planning on buying them out - with martial funds no doubt - and expects you to move and work the farm.\n\nYou need to take note of whats in the joint accounts, and other accounts.

Glad more people are learning about this - it\u2019s something I wish I had learned sooner.
