My husband and I have been married for 3 years, and we dated for 2 years before that. I was born and raised in the city. My husband grew up in a farm at the countryside. His family has a large farm and although we live in the city for work, we go to the farm often and try to help his family. \n\nAnyway, since I don't want to stay at home and send my husband alone, I'm trying to help even though I don't know much about farm things. As I said, I grew up in the city, I don't have the slightest knowledge of farm life, I'm still trying to learn but I can't do some things.\n\nFor example, when we go out on the field for pick fruit I find it difficult to stand because the ground is aimed. I'm constantly slipping and falling and frankly, I don't want to go into the fruit picking because of it. My husband keeps saying that I have to get used to it, it's not that aimed. Or when I fall he says \"you're okay, get up\" and laugh at me even if I get hurt.\n\nI'm not a person who likes to whine, or I'm not a person who says \"I grew up in the city, my nails are going to be chipped, I can't do these things\". Really, I'm trying to help from the heart, which I don't have to.\n\nMy husband has recently started comparing me to his mother. He says things like \"my mom is doing this, you should be able to do it too\" or \"look how good my mom is doing, you can't do it\".\n\nI've been joking about it for a long time but my heart is breaking at this point. Today we were talking in the car on our way to help out on the farm, and he said, \"My mom and I are not happy with what you're doing, get better or don't come at all.\"\n\nSo I briefly told him to pull over, and as I got off I told him to stay on the farm with his mother, that I don't have to do these chores, that it's not my career, and not to come home. He left me on the side of the road. \n\nNow he's texting me saying I'm an asshole, that's how he grew\n up and that I'm rude saying don't come home, AITAH?\n\nEdit: okay I have to make something clear. I'm not choking him with \"take me with you\" stuff. He insists that I should help and I should learn these things because we're married and farm life is a part of who he is. I suggested that I could stay behind and he refused it, several times.", "created_utc": 1668283763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yth1ao/aitah_for_telling_my_30f_husband_34m_not_to_come/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They already know how to do a bunch of things I didn't know happened on a dairy farm when I met my husband. There's a learning curve even between different types of farm. I have no clue where to start on a fruit tree. Vegetable farming is another type of farm I don't know much about, I don't even know what half their machines are called.

It is a fundamental issue that he speaks to you with such disrespect, and that he didn't make it clear that what he wanted for his life is to go back to the farm. You should part ways", "Why are you married to him? Honestly, I don\u2019t get it? Is he like a 20 in bed with cooking skills of Bobby Flay who likes to massage your feet nightly?
