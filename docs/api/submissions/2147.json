{"id": 2147, "submission_id": "yth1ao", "title": "AITAH for telling my (30F) husband (34M) not to come home after comparing me to his mother?", "selftext": "Hello everyone. First some context. My husband and I have been married for 3 years, and we dated for 2 years before that. I was born and raised in the city. My husband grew up in a farm at the countryside. His family has a large farm and although we live in the city for work, we go to the farm often and try to help his family. \n\nAnyway, since I don't want to stay at home and send my husband alone, I'm trying to help even though I don't know much about farm things. As I said, I grew up in the city, I don't have the slightest knowledge of farm life, I'm still trying to learn but I can't do some things.\n\nFor example, when we go out on the field for pick fruit I find it difficult to stand because the ground is aimed. I'm constantly slipping and falling and frankly, I don't want to go into the fruit picking because of it. My husband keeps saying that I have to get used to it, it's not that aimed. Or when I fall he says \"you're okay, get up\" and laugh at me even if I get hurt.\n\nI'm not a person who likes to whine, or I'm not a person who says \"I grew up in the city, my nails are going to be chipped, I can't do these things\". Really, I'm trying to help from the heart, which I don't have to.\n\nMy husband has recently started comparing me to his mother. He says things like \"my mom is doing this, you should be able to do it too\" or \"look how good my mom is doing, you can't do it\".\n\nI've been joking about it for a long time but my heart is breaking at this point. Today we were talking in the car on our way to help out on the farm, and he said, \"My mom and I are not happy with what you're doing, get better or don't come at all.\"\n\nSo I briefly told him to pull over, and as I got off I told him to stay on the farm with his mother, that I don't have to do these chores, that it's not my career, and not to come home. He left me on the side of the road. \n\nNow he's texting me saying I'm an asshole, that's how he grew\n up and that I'm rude saying don't come home, AITAH?\n\nEdit: okay I have to make something clear. I'm not choking him with \"take me with you\" stuff. He insists that I should help and I should learn these things because we're married and farm life is a part of who he is. I suggested that I could stay behind and he refused it, several times.", "created_utc": 1668283763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yth1ao/aitah_for_telling_my_30f_husband_34m_not_to_come/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would never treat a person like OP's husband is doing; and I would never expect anyone to do what I do. It's not their job, their responsibility or their lifestyle.

Before that he would take me with him to just sit around and get some fresh air.

Take him up on it.", "How was this discussed before marriage? Did you go into this relationship with that as a commitment you made to learn and help or is this something he just expected because you got married? If it's the latter.. you don't owe him that service to his family farm without discussion, negotiation and compromise if that's what he really wants .. or.. what is it you want? Marriage is not ownership", "If you don\u2019t want to be a farm wife then don\u2019t go.  \n\nHe\u2019s literally trying to bend you to his will.\n\nFor the record this all sounds awful", "So? Say no.", "Right? It feels like one of those reality shows where someone is put in incredibly uncomfortable positions on purpose for the cameras. WHY??

Because that feels like it should have been a conversation.\n\nAnd if he doesn't, why is he insisting you do everything his mother can do? It's her chosen livelihood, not yours. He presumably knew you had no experience with this when you got together and later married - if he wanted a relationship with someone into this stuff recreationally, that was an option for him, prior to marrying you.\n\nYou may be married, but marriage is about compromise, not changing who you are because your spouse likes something. Who *you* are is someone who doesn't get on with farming, yet you don't expect him to drop it because that's 'who you are'. He's being deeply and bizarrely selfish.", "It sounds like he\u2019s training you and expecting you to help him take over the farm eventually. \n\nIs that something you would be happy with ?  leaving the city and your job to  live  on a farm where you are expected to do manual labor all the time?", "I dont know if you knew what you were going to get here, OP, but it's always the same: leave him is the redditor solution to challenges with family or marriage. Your husband could have  been a good partner for 5 years, but to many of the redditors, one fight, one failure, one disappointment, one wrong sentence, and they will tell you \"that's the *real* him --better leave him now!\" \n\nIt is time to have sit down with him, about what range of possible relationships he sees for you with his family, and what range of relationships he sees for you and him.", "Tell him there is no reason you should learn this. It\u2019s not your interest, it\u2019s not ever what you\u2019ll do with your life. You love him and that he is a farm guy, but you aren\u2019t and never have been a farm girl and he has to accept that you won\u2019t be.\n\nI could never. Nothing wrong with it, but I\u2019m the type of girl who wears dresses and heels literally every day. I don\u2019t wanna be out in the dirt doing farm work. It\u2019s not me, and it sounds like it\u2019s not you."]}
