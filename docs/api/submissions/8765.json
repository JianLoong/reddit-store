In fact, were the a-holes for being upset about this. \n\nI guess the sisters got to my mother-in-law because then MIL came back and started parroting the same talking points about how messy our house is, how ungrateful my wife is and how my MIL cleans our house and cooks for the kids all of the time.

They also referred to watching our kids as FAVORS which is weird because they always ask to take them. \n\nMy mother-in-law says she won't come ever again to watch the kids. She no showed today so I had to call out today to watch the baby which is fine.  However, I don't like how the MIL is affecting my job and career with her pettiness as I had some important stuff scheduled today. Keep in mind, we pay her $300 (cash) a week to watch the kids.  Now I'm going to pay about $150 more per month for someone to watch the kids which is no big deal really.\n\nHowever, my son's birthday is tomorrow.

No.  It's not. \n\nThis isn't the first time such things have happened?  \n\nGet better caregivers.  MIL isn't competent.  If she can't prioritize safety issues like cleaning up after such things happen, she's not being safe for your children.

And they attacked your wife and you, insulted you both, etc.?   \n\nNTA.  This is about not spending time with the people that blame and insult you for the things that someone else did.  They behaved badly, and are blaming you.  That's not people who are healthy to have around your children.  I wouldn't want to have them around to do more of the same thing on your child's birthday, either.  \n\nProtecting your child and having a birthday that doesn't include people that blame you for the behavior of your MIL, that's just being a good parent.

It sounds like your MIL and family could pull the child care rug out from under you at any time and hold it over your head as bargaining leverage to get what they want.  It may cost a bit more, but the stability and peace of mind you'd get with outside child support is worth it.  If you miss just one or two days of work a month because MIL refuses to babysit, you've lost more than $150.  \n\n\nI would go even further to say I would NEVER trust your MIL to watch the kids unsupervised ever again.
