No.  It's not. \n\nThis isn't the first time such things have happened?  \n\nGet better caregivers.  MIL isn't competent.  If she can't prioritize safety issues like cleaning up after such things happen, she's not being safe for your children.  Makes me wonder how often they have gotten sick because of her unsafe lack of cleanliness.\n\nWhen your wife complained about MIL's incompetence in childcare, MIL went out and got herself some enablers to support her incompetence?  And they attacked your wife and you, insulted you both, etc.?   \n\nNTA.  This is about not spending time with the people that blame and insult you for the things that someone else did.  They behaved badly, and are blaming you.  That's not people who are healthy to have around your children.  I wouldn't want to have them around to do more of the same thing on your child's birthday, either.  \n\nProtecting your child and having a birthday that doesn't include people that blame you for the behavior of your MIL, that's just being a good parent.

It sounds like your MIL and family could pull the child care rug out from under you at any time and hold it over your head as bargaining leverage to get what they want.  It may cost a bit more, but the stability and peace of mind you'd get with outside child support is worth it.  If you miss just one or two days of work a month because MIL refuses to babysit, you've lost more than $150.  \n\n\nI would go even further to say I would NEVER trust your MIL to watch the kids unsupervised ever again.
