That means if her husband gets an aggressive lawyer, he could get full or primary custody and she will be paying him child support. \n\nAlso, the one cardinal rule about family court is whoever is willing to spend the most on lawyers and be the most aggressive gets things ruled in their favor. If she\u2019s so depressed she can\u2019t even take care of basic responsibilities or get out of bed, which means the husband is handling all the child care and also the one supporting the child, and she also isn\u2019t working and has no money of her own to spend on lawyers, she\u2019s going to wind up with some pro bono or flat-fee lawyer who has 150 other cases and gives her case minimal attention (or depending on the state and her circumstances, she might get no attorney at all) and her husband, if he\u2019s willing to fork out, will get a pit bull that goes after her hard.

Why should that be a shared or split chore if it's only benefitting one person?", "> Things have changed dramatically in family courts in the last 10 years. \n\nWhere though? Based on her spelling of \"defence\" OP seems to be from a Commonwealth country.", "Yep. Even abusive dads get half time physical custody.\n\nMy honorary nephew is forced to spend half the week with his convicted abuser.", "I don't know whether that's true, or whether I live in an especially backwards state. My husband, an amazing father to my stepson, had to fight tooth and nail to get 40% time. It's heartbreaking.", "Can confirm \ud83d\udc4d", "Happens all the time for men too. Men can even rape a woman which results in a pregnancy and win custody of that child. Custody in general is a hot mess that screws over men and women pretty royally as long as one is an evil AH who will go to any lengths.", "I mean, possible. But it could also very much not be. My MIL has been on disability for 30+ years because of mental health issues, so there's no way to know for sure. I was just wondering if OP had clarified in a comment or something.", "Can't stop laughing!!!", "You're not wrong, but that's not a question for us to ask. It's not our business or relevant to the AITA post, especially because we can reasonably infer that she's more than earned the right to do absolutely nothing if that's what she's doing (but i can say with at least 85% certainty that's not the case, and only bc i don't know her personally).\n\nThe object of the brief is to read, form an opinion based on reasonable and inferred assumptions, and deliver a judgement and helpful advice. No, she's not the asshole in this situation, even if her choice of words could have been more appropriate (but no one is using their big brain when they're livid). Wouldn't you agree?", "He is unkind ( not to say worst)! The point of marriage is to support one-another!", "Both benefit from non dusty baseboards both benefit more from a luxury apartment. If one of you has a mental health condition and needs to clean baseboards even when not dusty you need to get a mental health professional to help with that, splitting chores isn\u2019t the issue there.", "In most Western courts, so the US, Europe, and Australia (which is oddly considered part of the West when it comes to these types of things).\n\nThe change really started 20 years ago when the idea of parental alienation took root in the courts, and the presumption of 50-50 has actually become law in many places. It doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets 50-50, but it means all cases start with 50-50, and the balance only shifts towards one parent or the other if there are extenuating circumstances (typically the big 4: sexual abuse of children, violent history, mental illness, and a history of drug abuse). Of course, those things are subjective, and there are a lot of tricks and strategies you can use to take a grey situation and make it look more black and white, and that\u2019s where throwing money at experienced, aggressive attorneys and experts comes in. Who\u2019s to say who is mentally ill? A psychologist? Well, I\u2019m paying 20k for this psychologist and he thinks the other parent is mentally ill, so here\u2019s the proof. That sort of thing.\n\nAs for imputing income, that\u2019s not a new thing at all and most courts do it. Unless she\u2019s on disability due to her mental issues, her income will be imputed as it will be assumed she can work if she wants to.\n\nThe reason most women get primary custody is because most men don\u2019t fight it. Most custody cases never go to court, and 90% of the ones that do don\u2019t go to trial. Most people are able to agree amongst themselves. Of the cases that do make it to court, and especially that don\u2019t settle and go to trial, men wind up getting custody just as much as women do.", "I know it\u2019s not the standard everywhere, but it is rapidly going that way in most places.", "\"but doesn\u2019t mind when she\u2019s the one covering all or most the bill?'\n\nThe idea is partially that if someone chooses to go over the top or above and beyond the baseline that is on them. It does not create an obligation on the other party/person to do the same. \n\nI would agree with you if husband had been asking/insisting on OP covering more of the vacation/hospital bills up to this point. But it seems that OP freely choose to do that, when she could have asked to split those costs equally but instead just paid for all/most of it herself. Op decided to go above and beyond that is on her. \n\nFor example let's say two friends/partners/spouses regularly go out to eat and split the bill 50/50%. One day person A gets a big bonus and says I'm paying the whole bill. Person B says great thank you. That does not mean Person B then has to pay for the whole meal next time, Person B is perfectly fine to ask to split the meal like they have been. It does not make person B a hypocrite. \n\nOr Person A says I'm feeling a really fancy place say $50 a plate vs the normal $25 a plate and person A says I'll pay $75 you pay the usual $25. Just because person A choose to pay for more of a luxury does not mean Person B has to reciprocate.", "This is very manipulative IMO. Firstly this is not a fancy vacation or restaurant this is hospital bills from the birth of THEIR child. I would understand if OP decided to have a child with another male or sperm donor because let\u2019s say his genetics are poor or he is infertile. But no it\u2019s his kid. He knows she is not comfortable with this stingy behavior so she covers the bills when she can under the guise of love in hopes she will have him reciprocate that love. \n\nShe says it in her post she only does this for people she loves and cares for. He is an AH because he uses that to his advantage not because he wants everything \u201ceven.\u201d If that was the case he would pay 50% of the costs for hospital bills before she did. He didn\u2019t even mention it. Even in your poor example the friend would be an AH if they continued to go to fancy dinners paid for and every time they got extra money refused to do anything to acknowledge the other friends good gestures. He didn\u2019t even thank her like WHAT?? But even then I would tell them to cut that friend loose because I don\u2019t see any benefit to being friends with someone like that. \n\nThis is my opinion but if that\u2019s something you consider an ok trait to have that\u2019s your opinion. Personally I don\u2019t think generous people and stingy people can be friends let alone married with kids because the stingy person almost always takes advantage of the generosity. I myself am a generous person and yes I do expect reciprocity and if I don\u2019t receive it I don\u2019t hang around that person again, if that\u2019s an AH move then I guess I\u2019m an AH. Even in the example of her birthday or whatever I don\u2019t consider it even, to me it feels like cheap maintenance on his part. I have met many stingy people and in my experience many of them have been lonely and alienated their families/friends later in life but I guess you could call it anecdotal evidence and pretend it\u2019s not an issue. Real life is messy and complicated so it requires flexibility, being frugal is different from stingy so this is a character flaw that should be changed through self help and therapy. Not something that can be rationalized through all these mental gymnastics y\u2019all are doing in the comments."]}
