We have always kept our finances separate.

He on the other hand is extremely calculative when it comes to his own money and says every cent he pays for me has to be paid back unless its a special occasion.

It was a complicated conception process, pregnancy and delivery. The total bill was exorbitant and I paid about 75% of it because I got a huge bonus that year and he paid the balance. I never expected him to repay the balance and he never brought it up either. Subsequently whenever he got bonuses etc it would go to his own expenses or things for him instead of anything for me.\n\nFast forward to now, I am suffering a mental health problem and am unable to work. Firstly he doesnt see mental health problems as real problems and when I am unable to get out of bed he thinks im being lazy. Next since im unable to work he pays for all the bills but makes it a point to record down every single cent so that I can repay him at the soonest. I dont deny he has forked out alot of his money running the house while I am unable to work but I lost my mind yesterday when he asked he asked me back for $5 he spent on food delivery.

At first when my partner discussed this with me I was closed minded by just saying be positive everyday or don\u2019t worry about things.
