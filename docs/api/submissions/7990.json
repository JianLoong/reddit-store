I am the only daughter in my family, other than my cousins, and I have a twin and an older brother.\n\nSo it all starts when I was told to do some chores because our landlord was gonna come and inspect the place. I noticed that I was the only one doing the chores in the house while my siblings sat on their video games and ate junk food. I tried and tried to get them to do something like take out the trash or cook dinner even. I went to my mom and she told me that I don't need to worry about them. I started to get really mad to the point where I was yelling at my brothers but they did nothing. I was grounded for a week for \"misbehaving\" and that I should \"learn to respect my siblings\". \n\nSo I told my mom that I won't do anything until I'm ungrounded and when my brothers start doing their share of the house work because I was basically their maid. I EVEN COOKED DINNER AND LUNCH FOR THEM. \n\nSo am I being a brat and just not wanting to do anything or are my siblings in the wrong here?\n\nAlso my older brother is 21 and me and my twin are 16.
