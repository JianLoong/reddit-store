Sometimes, partners need to think for themselves. NTA.", "NTA- my husband would NEVER leave me alone while he went out to dinner, no matter the situation. Needing some air and a break is one thing, ditching you to get dinner by himself is another. I can\u2019t imagine ever doing that to my husband or him doing that to me. Doesn\u2019t being married mean through sickness and health? Gotta be there during the stressful, painful times", "NTA. If \"I am in blinding pain\" is not enough communication for him, then he must either not like you very much or only hear things he wants to hear.", "Nta.  He's in the wrong.  You don't just leave a spouse in pain.  At the very least he should have told you he was going to grab food (drive through not sit down) and brought some for you", "NTA what the hell?", "NTA\n\nBeing around when a loved one is hurt and can't move is basic stuff. He also clearly knew that which is why he said he was going for fresh air when he was having dinner. He fully knew if he said \"hey, I want to go out, do you need me\" you would have told him to stay home.\n\nHe just wanted to be away and now he's making excuses.", "NTA. Even if your husband didn\u2019t pick up that you needed his help, he was deceitful by being dishonest about what he was doing. He should have been concerned especially with your comment about possibly passing out from the pain - sure, he may not be able to do much to prevent that but you\u2019d think an adult would know that it\u2019s not good to leave someone in that condition alone. What if you\u2019d passed out and hit your head while he was away?\n\nAt the very least, he should\u2019ve been honest about what he was doing (and offered to bring you back food). A loving couple should *want* to support and be there for each other and be honest with each other.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t even sound like he went out of his way to make sure you were comfortable and safe before he left. I understand needing a break, but I don\u2019t understand abandoning your partner in their time of utmost need.", "NTA - if you're in so much pain that you need him to be nearby for safety reasons (which is what it sounds like) then he should keep you updated with plans. If he needs a break, that is fine - this kind of situation is stressful for all involved. BUT there's a big difference between popping out for some air and sitting down for a meal.\nIf he was just out for air, you could call him back anytime. But at a meal, once he had ordered there will likely be a big delay in responsiveness.\nIf you urgently needed support, would he have still been able to help?", "NTA but maybe your husband grew up with ppl around him not staying with him while he was in pain so he thought that was the norm", "NTA. This sounds bizarre. Being there to fluff pillows and fetch meds and help you move to the bathroom if needed and just being there is base line. It\u2019s called being in love. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing when you can\u2019t be there - this happened when partner was out of town for example. But to just wander off out for dinner (not a I\u2019ll go get us dinner situation) is shocking. \n\nLove is something you do, not some abstract feeling. What is he demonstrating he feels about you?

He's AWFUL. Get rid of him. NTA", "There is so much missing. Are you on pain meds? If not, why not? And when you say he took himself out to dinner, what exactly do you mean? Did you actually talk to him about it, or hasnt he come home yet? And in your reasoning as to why you might be the asshole, you say you blew up your marriage, as in youve decided you want to divorce him?", "Not TA. Your husband is.", "Yeah it sounds very bad. I'm leaning NTA but only based on this I am not 100% sure. Depends on how he is general, and how you have been with him when he's sick. History matters.", "He needs to communicate better. Going out for air and going out for dinner are different things. Maybe if you had known he was going to go out and leave you for any length of time you could have communicated you needed him there. But to me going out for air is stepping outside for a few minutes. He's TA for not communicating properly, for not thinking about you and just going for dinner, for not realising the level of pain you were in based on what you told him and how you presented and finally, for trying to manipulate the situation now and direct the blame at you!", "NTA - so much sympathy for you.  I've been where you've been, winced where you wince, been unable to sleep for the pain.  And I totally agree your SO should have been around on evening 1 for you.\n\nThe thing is - and this is not to minimise your discomfort - this is going to be really sore for a long time, and you're going to want to vent and have people help for quite a bit.  Hopefully your SO will pull his act together to be part of the solution for you.  But finding a cohort of people to help will mean that not all the weight's on him, and his help & empathy can stay fresh (not sure that's the best word, but hopefully you know what I mean).", "I've bruised my tailbone before and it was horrible, I can't imagine a broken one! So sorry for you OP.\n\nBut, that being said... if your husband is otherwise a caring and considerate partner, this may have been a miscommunication. Also, it is mentally hard to see your loved ones in agony and not really be able to help alleviate that pain. So perhaps your husband needed some time to recharge his own batteries and stepped away for a bit to do that.\n\nWithout additional info, I don't want to assume that your husband is a heartless selfish beast, and I'm going with NAH.", "INFO: is there more to this story?  What happened before he said he needed some fresh air?", "As a rule of therapy, I've been told to communicate and assuming my loved one know what am I thinking.\n\nAdditionally, I personally wouldn't like people searching my location, but maybe that was agreed upon between you two. If so, we carry on.\n\nTo me, this comes down to him saying he \"needs fresh air\" or whatever... and then turning that into staying out for over an hour and having a meal. That's on the AH scale for sure, as it's neglecting to inform a vulnerable you (at minimum).\n\nI'd learn towards NTA unless you went overboard in how addressed this with him.", "No, you're NTA.  But you can't expect people to react the way you would react. If you need him there say so plainly. \n\nMen are generally clueless when we have to guess what a woman wants. Just say \"I need you here\"", "NTA. There's really no evidence from your post to suggest this but I really feel like he's cheating on you.", "This sounds like me. I expect people to react the way *i* would, and that's not fair. You have to straight up tell him, \"I'm hurt and I'll need your support and your help.\"\n\nTell him what you want, and then you can be mad if he doesn't deliver. But it's not fair to expect something of somebody if you never told them you wanted it in the first place.", "NTA leaning towards NAH, as you should communicate your feelings more with him.  He can't read your mind. If you expect him to be there for you, you need to let him know that.   Not everyone wants, or needs, another person around when they're hurt or in pain.\n\nHe should have perhaps been more forthcoming about where he was going, or asked if you wanted food, too.

Even then some people are in too much pain to want to be around others.", ">antisocial personality\n\nThat's very much what I'm concerned about. He said \"ok well, the next time YOU need to tell me if you don't want me to leave for 2 hours,\" and I was like \"...the point I'm trying to make is that it shouldn't cross your mind to leave your spouse who is in agonizing pain for 2 hours...\" and then realized I can't explain empathy to someone who doesn't seem to understand it.", "Thank you for your response. It's helpful to hear from a husband's perspective. I totally get needing to recharge and that caring for someone can be exhausting. However, this was literally hour 2 of my blinding pain.", "I only broke a chip off mine, at eight, and I still wince sharply thinking about it. To do it as an adult as a full fracture sounds like all kinds of hell. I think I would choose a hysterectomy, which in an of itself felt like being hit by a Mack truck, again over that. Either way, I have every confidence that my husband would at least be in the other room playing Tears of the Kingdom and checking in frequently, and would have ordered in for both of us instead of just taking care of his selfish backside. I\u2019m really sorry yours is so myopic.", "I have too. Fell down the stairs- also tore ligaments in both ankles, slipped and landed on the corner of a wall - still Jo idea how I managed that one, and the last time a back to back labour with my now 10yr old. The last time, I was on painkillers daily for 2yrs and I still have pain if I sit wrong for too long. Having to be rigid in how I sit - doesn\u2019t matter what chair - had caused knock on issues with my hips that were already in poor shape from pregnancy and a childhood dislocation. \nOP - my husband barely leaves my side when I\u2019m in pain, no matter the reason. That yours left to get dinner while you had a literal broken back is insane.", "You appear to have married a clone of your husband's father, babe. Perhaps your husband doesn't find his father's behavior *funny*, per se, but he certainly finds it reasonable enough to copy. Condolences.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s genetic but it absolutely is *learned.*\n\nMy dad grew up listening to the way my grandfather spoke to my grandmother, and it has shaped his mindset and his relationship with my mom. He was raised with a father who felt his wishes should dictate what happens at all times, because he was more important than anyone else. So my father thinks he deserves the same priority as head of his own house. \n\nMy parents are divorced now. They shouldn\u2019t have been gone through with the wedding. His behaviour was evident before they even married. She had to ask to be treated with empathy (and even if she did, was often given none).\n\nAnd just a heads up\u2026 it affected us kids too.\n\nWhen we called him on his shit, he\u2019d laugh, and then get mad and tell us we didn\u2019t know what we were talking about, we were being ridiculous, *no one* would agree with us (but he\u2019d be furious if we actually went out to call his bluff and ask people lmao).\n\nSo.. be watchful.", "Did he even bring you back anything? How were you supposed to get any food with a broken tailbone!", "All I can think of, as a disabled person, is how you probably couldn't count on him if you were to get big-S Sick like with permanent chronic illness, cancer, MS, etc.\n\nIf he needed a break day 1 and did this without even saying anything or letting you know he'd be gone for so long or even making sure you have what you need before leaving... really think this through, hard.\n\nIt's not rare at all for men to leave their sick partners because they're no longer the one being nurtured/cared for.", "He went to a sit down dinner while you were debilitated with pain. I think you communicated just fine- He took himself out to dinner, which isn't just \"a walk\" that's at least an hour or two depending on if he was with someone or not. He didn't help you at all, it sounds like he's really taking after his father and id already be walking out of that marriage since it seems he has already checked out.", "nope. victim blaming. this sounds like some shit from that women are from venus book. if books could kill (podcast) did an episode on that, if you\u2019re still laid up. you might find it relevant to your interest. if you have to spend your life trying to find the \u201cright\u201d way to tell him things, you might as well not say anything at all. cause it\u2019s only ever the right way if he\u2019s interested in listening. nta.", "What did you want him to do? Sit and do sonething as a distraction? A lot of people don't know how to help with pain because nothing they do will physically make you better. Some people want company while others want no one near them.", "Totally understandable.  I\u2019ve been on both sides of it.  When my pain gets high, patience and understanding seem to get low.  \n\nAnd sometimes the person really is just being an asshole and is being inconsiderate.   But in general, I try to believe that most disagreements are caused by lack of understanding/communication as opposed to disregard for our partners.   \n\nHope you recover soon.", "I was like \"How...?\" but then I remembered how my sister resurrected the girls' rugby team at her high school and was always coming home with bruises and broken digits.", "1,000% this.", "Neither of you are the asshole.\n\nI think you expect him to react the same way that you would, sticking around and getting whatever that person needs. I think a lot of people are like that.\n\nMe personally, I hate being waited on hand and foot, it drives me bananas. Plus I'm grumpy AF when I'm in pain and I just want to be left alone. I have a phone and can easily text or call if I need help. \n\nI would have probably pissed you off too, because I would think you'd want the same as me. Don't be too hard on him, he now knows what you need and hopefully will be there for you.", "NTA, I am someone who would need this to be communicated clearly, spelled out \"I want you to stay with me\", but I can see most people would not need such a clear memo.", "NTA. My husband would never leave me alone in extreme pain and go off to dinner, just as I would never do that if he were in the same position. \n\nI suspect you have many other stories of his negligence and callousness.", "NTA. Honestly speaking, a stranger on the street would\u2019ve treated you better than your supposed husband. Seen more empathy from a rock than in this man. \n\nY-W-B-T-A to yourself if you continued to stay with him and he doesn\u2019t clean up his act. You deserve better.", "NTA", "I think the real red flag isn't that he went out. Sometimes people can be stupid. My sis has mobility issues recently and I went out and worked for awhile because it completely slipped my mind that she couldn't handle food prep.\n\nWant to know what happened when I came back? I apologised.\n\nI didn't say she should have communicated that she needed me back early, I apologised because _I should have been more aware_.", "NTA.  If someone is in pain, you do what you can to make them feel comfortable.  Telling them to get fresh air is a joke.", "Um, no girl, no. \n\nMy husband buzzes around me when I have a cold asking if I need anything. Bringing food, water, and meds. Your man doesn\u2019t care you\u2019re in pain or about your needs. This is beyond his requirement for \u201ccommunication \u201c\n\nDTMFA", "NTA. Look up statistics on men who leave female partners when they develop serious illnesses. \n\nMen suck.", "NTA\nA broken coccyx is one of the most painful bones to fracture and you can\u2019t get comfortable for ages! The fact that he wouldn\u2019t ASSUME you needed him is concerning. Also, going to get himself dinner and not you too? At least if he\u2019d brought you both takeout home that would be one thing- not what you needed or asked for but better. I would suggest telling the numbskull what you need verbatim \u201cI need you to sit on the couch until I am in less pain\u201d \u201cI need you to cook this soup for me and get me in a position to eat it\u201d. It sucks when we take care of our SOs so well when they need it and we can\u2019t get a scrap of the same in return.", "NTA. Your husband is a very weak person.", "NTA\n\nAnd why would he go out to eat? Can't he order in something for you? \n\nLeaving was stupid, and he knows it. You shouldn't have had to tell him, because if you were discharged from medical care with him, he would have been told.", "Definitely NTA but I will risk an attempt at playing devil\u2019s advocate. I think with most men I know, physical pain is not something that you\u2019re culturally taught to burden others with, but you should instead suck it up and bear the pain without complaint. A lot of guys will think that there is nothing that they could do to fix the pain of your broken tailbone so they might figure to just leave you alone for a while. That\u2019s my attempt at an explanation for this behavior.", "Your husband is a gaslighting asshole.  He tells you one thing, does another, and then says *you* need to communicate better?  I recommend you call someone who actually cares about you to come over and stay with you until the pain recedes.\n\nNTA.", "Broke mine once when I was a teenager.  Slept curled up in an overstuffed chair, had to take baths instead of showers because I couldn't straighten up, was always hunched over at the waist because of things.  The pain was ridiculous but I still had to go to school.\n\nOP NTA", "While it\u2019s fair that your partner can\u2019t read your mind, certain things shouldn\u2019t have to be said. In YOUR situation, you were trying to care for your wife in a way she didn\u2019t need and that\u2019s where communication can be to blame. However, you still showed care and concern. OPs spouse didn\u2019t do ANYTHING to help her. In fact he left completely. It\u2019s not a lack of communication but a lack of compassion.", "While I agree with you, that\u2019s certainly not a trait I\u2019d want in a husband", "It\u2019s not even about the pain.  It\u2019s about your mobility. \n\nIf you were stuck on the couch, you\u2019d likely need help getting up to go to the bathroom (and getting up again) and getting food etc. \n\nTo leave you for over and hour to go out to eat is..,incredibly troubling. \n\nAdd in the pain (and dear god, I can\u2019t imagine how bad wiping would hurt) and you getting up/walking would be incredibly risky. \n\nNTA.", "Had the same thing happen to me before. It\u2019s an awful kind of pain because everything puts stress on it. He\u2019s being a TA.

I hope you feel better soon", "Red flags waaaaaaving \ud83d\udea9", "NTA This is all a very big sign to go. The apple hasn't fallen far from the tree. Laughing about that story is bad, but performing it is worse. Your husband just performed it. \n\nYou are literally shortening your lifespan by staying with someone that will wear you out when they need caretaking, but will not return the gesture. This is why married women have shorter lifespans.", "100%. He seems like the kind of guy who would expect his wife to wait on him hand and foot if he had a mild sprain, but can't deal with reciprocating.", "Wish I could give you an award \ud83e\udee1", "Question, where was your dinner? Because you clearly couldn't fix yourself anything. Obviously he's an AH for the complete lack of empathy or sympathy but how mad do we have to be at him for leaving you alone, unable to attend your basic physical needs?", "OP, this is probably not going to get better.  Please think long and hard about having kids with this man.", "Please don't listen to this person. This has literally nothing to do with your situation. \n\nYour husband wasn't burnt out from 2 hours and he knew damn well you wouldn't want him to leave you stranded without even saying anything.\n\nHold him accountable and leave if he doesn't change. What's the point of a partner who doesn't support you?", "I agree that this could be the case.   \n\nI suppose it\u2019s hard for me to comment on a situation given that we only see one perspective.  \n\nSo, I try to offer perspective while showing sympathy for the OP, but also trying to refrain from condemning the other party.\n\nBut this is Reddit, and It might  absolutely be the wrong forum for trying to be nuanced.", "I've fractured my tailbone twice, now I have to have seat pillows for work and long car drives.

I hope you've got better luck in the future", "Even without her being pain, it\u2019s so weird for a spouse to go out to dinner by themselves and not bring their partner some food.

I think it would make me feel very lonely at the very least.", "Don't project your non-existent standards on someone else.", "I hear that. But yea perhaps nuance can\u2019t be found in AITA lol", "Look into ball chairs, they are an office chair with an inflatable exercise ball for the seat.
