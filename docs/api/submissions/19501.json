They seem very comfortable. OPs brother was never gonna fail unless he became an addict or similar and that would have been a whole different kind of failure. \n\nThey gave his brother the 25k, as agreed, let him have some fun for 3 yrs and now they are paying for him to get a good education. They also house and feed him. They just won't pay for funnsies anymore. \n\nIt seems OPs parents wanted to teach the kids the worth of hard work and money, but still set them up with a comfortable start regardless. That's not a bad thing. \n\nAt some point kids/adults need to learn how to make (financial) decisions and take responsibility for them. It doesn't start at 18 with 25k, it already starts with pocket money and chores much earlier. The brother made a bad choice at 18, but not back breaking or life destroying. If he doesn't learn from his mistakes now at 21, he wasn't going to learn later either. He probably would have \"wasted\" the 125k too. Or maybe the experiences gained would have been worth it to him - also a valid choice. \n\n3 out 4 kids turned out financially responsible it seems. It also sounds like they were all parented more or less the same. Kids are individuals. You can do everything the same but it can still have different results. \n\nIf OPs brother prefers a bit more hedonistic lifestyle that's perfectly valid. But he's an adult and now he has to figure out how he can sustain that lifestyle and set priorities for himself. That's prime adulting. That's part of growing up. Nobody else can sort out his priorities for him. \n\nYes, 18 and 21 is still young, but you need to let your adult child make their own choices and mistakes to learn from them. OPs parents still provide a comfortable fall back it seems, should things ever go drastically wrong. That's honestly the best thing you can do for a child if you can afford it. \n\nIf you force them to make the safe, responsible choice, do they really learn anything?", "Totally agree.", "Also Craigslist and FB marketplace in big cities.

Also, I don't see what lesson of hard work you are teaching by giving them money for nothing. By not giving them the choose at all, by saying \"be responsible for 4 years and then you will get a payout\" you are actually teaching them that work and responsibility are rewarded, as well as giving them some time to mature.", "The 125k is the payout for hard work, as you pointed out. \n\nBut they probably didn't want to leave a child with nothing should they choose something else entirely.

Which are very mild in this case. \n\nHonestly choosing 25k now over 125k later after any type of education is pretty dumb. Most 16yr olds would know that is dumb. He probably would have used the 125k irresponsibly too, as is his right to do so with a gift, because he still feels entitled at 21.

Wouldn't it have been better to just tell him that if he wanted to \"see the world\",  he needed to get a job to finance that?

Letting him bum around for years didn't seem to have taught him much", "Sure, would have been a good option too, but it's not what happend. \n\nIn the end, he was 18yr old and I think that's plenty old enough to understand the options of 25k now for whatever, but that's it or 125k if you get education or some other achievement. \n\nAt 18 you might be a bit more naive and a bit more impulsive, but you aren't stupid and old enough to understand consequences. If he didn't understand that at 18 already, 3-4 yrs are unlikely to change that.

They're still being incredibly generous (and all around good parents in general) in feeding, housing, and paying for a good education when he came back, for free, expecting nothing in return.  What you're saying is that they should have taken the choice away from him entirely and that *that* somehow would have taught him a better lesson.  Not true.  It sounds like he was never going to learn that lesson anyway, and what happens after he got the 125k after four years of college, blew THAT money, and then... what?  Expected more?  Would he still be claiming it's not fair?  Would the parents continue needing to force his choices for him so he always makes the \"best\", and only, decisions?  You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. \n\nThe best lesson was to give him the option, let him choose, and then make him deal with the consequences of his choices and actions, which is what they've done.  Another family might have cut him off completely after that and told him, \"Tough luck, buttercup!\"  But this family seems to be willing to take him back in and help him learn to do better.
