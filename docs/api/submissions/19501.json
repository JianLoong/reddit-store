Obviously their experiment isn't going to necessarily neatly translate into some storybook lesson.  One potential takeaway for someone in the brother's shoes could simply be \"wow, my parents are actually fucking loaded and they weren't bluffing about that 100k! Oops\" Not exactly timeless wisdom.  \n\nAnyway, if I would do anything differently in your shoes, I would just maybe rise above the idea that you are more mature or make better decisions than your brother because of your reaction to a reality tv show level stunt.

You could try to be the bigger person and defend yourself and your choices without insulting him back. Your decisions worked out for you.

Hopefully he can construct a more positive narrative of his life going forward.", "He said you were dumb for not exploring the world- but wants you to share the money you got for opting to go to school instead of doing the same as him?
