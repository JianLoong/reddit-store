They seem very comfortable. OPs brother was never gonna fail unless he became an addict or similar and that would have been a whole different kind of failure. \n\nThey gave his brother the 25k, as agreed, let him have some fun for 3 yrs and now they are paying for him to get a good education. They also house and feed him. They just won't pay for funnsies anymore. \n\nIt seems OPs parents wanted to teach the kids the worth of hard work and money, but still set them up with a comfortable start regardless. That's not a bad thing. \n\nAt some point kids/adults need to learn how to make (financial) decisions and take responsibility for them. It doesn't start at 18 with 25k, it already starts with pocket money and chores much earlier. The brother made a bad choice at 18, but not back breaking or life destroying. If he doesn't learn from his mistakes now at 21, he wasn't going to learn later either. He probably would have \"wasted\" the 125k too. Or maybe the experiences gained would have been worth it to him - also a valid choice. \n\n3 out 4 kids turned out financially responsible it seems. It also sounds like they were all parented more or less the same. Kids are individuals. You can do everything the same but it can still have different results. \n\nIf OPs brother prefers a bit more hedonistic lifestyle that's perfectly valid. But he's an adult and now he has to figure out how he can sustain that lifestyle and set priorities for himself. That's prime adulting. That's part of growing up. Nobody else can sort out his priorities for him. \n\nYes, 18 and 21 is still young, but you need to let your adult child make their own choices and mistakes to learn from them. OPs parents still provide a comfortable fall back it seems, should things ever go drastically wrong. That's honestly the best thing you can do for a child if you can afford it. \n\nIf you force them to make the safe, responsible choice, do they really learn anything?", "Totally agree.", "Also Craigslist and FB marketplace in big cities.

By not giving them the choose at all, by saying \"be responsible for 4 years and then you will get a payout\" you are actually teaching them that work and responsibility are rewarded, as well as giving them some time to mature.", "The 125k is the payout for hard work, as you pointed out. \n\nBut they probably didn't want to leave a child with nothing should they choose something else entirely. Hence the 25k fallback option. \n\nHe gained a learning experience either way. He's an adult, he's allowed to make a bad choice and learn from the consequences. Which are very mild in this case. \n\nHonestly choosing 25k now over 125k later after any type of education is pretty dumb. Most 16yr olds would know that is dumb. He probably would have used the 125k irresponsibly too, as is his right to do so with a gift, because he still feels entitled at 21. I doubt 4 years of college or similar would have changed that.\n\nSome kids need to learn \"the hard way\" (though the hard way is still very benign here) or they never learn at all.", "\"You're a dumbass for being responsible. Now can i please have some of your money? I blew all of mine.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA, your brother is projecting being a \u201cgreedy asshole\u201d, it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s the prodigal son. What does he share with you that would warrant giving so much money?", "NTA, we reap what we sow. Follow the rest of your family and tell him to get bent.", "NTA\n\nIs it your money? Yes. So is he entitled to any of it? No. Simple as that.", "NTA, this is the marshmallow test. You passed, they didn't.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKEEP your money - all of you got the same deal.", "NTA.", "NTA. Buy him a toy car from Walmart and tell him now you got him a car and to get lost and NEVER ask you for money again.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is a mooch. Your parents granted him the same opportunities as the rest of you and he made a stupid choice.", "NTA, you parents gave you an opportunity that few get, don't set yourself back to help out someone who wasted the same opportunity.", "\"I know it doesn't seem fair but he chose to party with his money\"\n\nFrom my perspective, it totally seems fair. Don't doubt yourself.  Don't let him guilt trip you.  If you did decide to \"share\" some of this money, it would totally be your own call on your terms.\n\nYour brother knew very well the terms of the deal, and made his decision.  You mom is right to shield you from him.  They are already supporting him some more beyond the 25k with the free rent.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but I think you know that", "You; NTA\n\nyour parents; total assholes. Who the hell does this to your kids... why not give each kid 10k for a year of travel after highschool and then 100k post grad?  Absolutely idiotic.", "NTA you don't owe your brother anything. Like you said, you earned what you got and were smart about it", "NTA and actually, it is fair. He was given the same options as you and your other brothers, he made a choice, he lived it up and now he's back down on earth having to deal with the consequences of his decisions.\n\n\nHe can't have it both ways and you need to stop thinking this is unfair to him. It's perfectly fair, he's just dumb. Your older brothers are right to tell him to get bent - you should too.", "NTA. Your brother is learning a harsh lesson about the value of delayed gratification and living with one\u2019s choices.", "NTA- he needs to grow up.", "NTA", "NTA You worked hard by going to school, but your brother chose not to go down the same path. So, he got what he chose. And, you can certainly choose not to share your money with him.", "ESH - this is a really weird flex from the parents. \n\nLike, what a terrible financial experiment to run on your kids.", "NTA, he\u2019s a short sighted idiot and that\u2019s his problem. Don\u2019t let it be yours too. \n\nBe prepared for him to bring this money up down the line when talking about sharing any inheritance you get from your parents.", "HE NEEDS TO GET A DAMN JOB! And stop expecting everybody else to pay his way in life.", "I missed out on the party part of college but I had spending money.", "This. Carry on the torch from your correct brothers, and pass it forward.", "If you have any estate sales they are a gold mine of great finds. \n\nWe bought most of our baby\u2019s furniture brand new but there was a specific type of rocking chair I wanted to find, because both my husband and I had one as babies. My MIL found one, in perfect condition at an estate sale for like $40", "Ikea isn't exactly cheap. And the quality for the stuff you get is actually quite cheap with the low density plywood which makes it hard to fix as well. Just my two cents.", "Yeah I agree like they know which one is better why even offer the bad choice to someone who doesn't know better and then blame them for it later... Like as the kids grew up they could probably guess who was going to do which one. \"Joe has poor impulse control... Good luck to him!\"", "The parents are paying for his schooling and letting him live at home for free. Doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re setting him up for failure.", "Very good idea.  If it's big stuff, can rent a home depot truck by the hour to haul back to the house.", "Probably if I wasn\u2019t drunk right now.", "But the options were college/other education or work. Wouldn't it have been better to just tell him that if he wanted to \"see the world\",  he needed to get a job to finance that? Then at the end of 4 years he would have known the value of working for what he wants and had a nice nest egg. Letting him bum around for years didn't seem to have taught him much", "Sure, would have been a good option too, but it's not what happend. \n\nIn the end, he was 18yr old and I think that's plenty old enough to understand the options of 25k now for whatever, but that's it or 125k if you get education or some other achievement. \n\nAt 18 you might be a bit more naive and a bit more impulsive, but you aren't stupid and old enough to understand consequences. If he didn't understand that at 18 already, 3-4 yrs are unlikely to change that. And in those cases facing the consequences of your actions is the only thing that will teach some people.", "It's not their responsibility at that point. They're still being incredibly generous (and all around good parents in general) in feeding, housing, and paying for a good education when he came back, for free, expecting nothing in return.  What you're saying is that they should have taken the choice away from him entirely and that *that* somehow would have taught him a better lesson.  Not true.  It sounds like he was never going to learn that lesson anyway, and what happens after he got the 125k after four years of college, blew THAT money, and then... what?  Expected more?  Would he still be claiming it's not fair?  Would the parents continue needing to force his choices for him so he always makes the \"best\", and only, decisions?  You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. \n\nThe best lesson was to give him the option, let him choose, and then make him deal with the consequences of his choices and actions, which is what they've done.  Another family might have cut him off completely after that and told him, \"Tough luck, buttercup!\"  But this family seems to be willing to take him back in and help him learn to do better.  A valuable lesson, indeed."]}
