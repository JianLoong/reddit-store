I'm sure hearing those things from your grandmother wasn't pleasant but she's an old woman, from a different cultural era and possibly not altogether there if she is changing her mind on your eating habits within the same sitting. Most of us begin to fade to some degree at that age. Most importantly, she's the reason you exist, the reason you can post on here. She's probably been through far more than you know and no doubt took some unpleasant comments from her own G-ma and others at your age. Young people were expected to take their verbal lumps with some level of good grace in many cultures, and if they were catching poor words they tended to change to adhere to family/cultural norms. Doesn't make it okay or less disagreeable, simply what was. We also lack a little info on the situation, when she called you a \"whore\" for \"having boobs\" were you wearing something revealing or tight fitting that would offend her older/ more modest sensibilities? When you were eating, were you wolfing food down like a fat guy at a wings joint?\n\nI also wouldn't categorize her comments as \"spiteful\" despite their rudeness. Spitefulness is intentional malice, and her comments, however off-putting, display concern with your welfare. \"Putting meat on your bones\" is an old standby, simply means they worry you don't eat enough. 'Looking unladylike' is a worry that you'll scare off potential suitors.\n\nFinally, I think what puts you in TA category is the way you responded. You could have stood your ground if you weren't willing to take those words from your elder, and simply said the first part, \u201cstop speaking to me that way,\" and you would have been justified.

And honestly. Your mom is an AH too for not backing you up. If somebody talked to my kids like that. Ohhh they would be left sobbing like a small baby. And my mother too would leave them crying. The way she was speaking to you was disgusting and cruel and she is in fact, a spiteful old hag.", "Oh, wow, she dished it out but couldn't take it. Age is not an excuse.

Your entire family sounds like a nightmarish hellscape of damaging views of femininity, toxic traditions values, gossip, and delusion. I had an ex whose grandmother did the exact same thing to her mom and her and lemme tell you, that kind of putrid venom does multigenerational damage. Every generation beyond it becomes bitter and takes it out on others. I suppose the same could be said of any kind of abuse.

Just because they are family does not mean you have to or should respect someone when they are being disrespectful to you. Screw that. To me, all it says is \"be quiet and take the abuse from your elders\". Since 6th grade, I have been told to cover up my chest and my parents would comment about my weight all the time, and it resulted in an ED that I have just now been able to get help for. GAH! It makes me so mad. When I had a kid, I made it clear to my husband that if anyone starts any comments like this, I will never take it lightly, we will shut it down, leave, and if needed go NC.", "NTA, grandma set you up OP.

It's been bothering me since last night.\n\nAnywho, what I was saying is that there was no need for the proportionate response, but I'm not trying to judge how she handled her business beyond the fact that it was less antagonistic than it could have been to still be proportionate (thus answering whether or not she was the asshole). I generally have enough privilege that I don't feel like I have to be eye-for-an-eye, but I recognize that it's privilege and don't judge others harshly for feeling the need to give what they got.", "That's a nice strawman you've built there.

They're literally making ops point AGAIN because you seem so opposed to the idea that op is offended that their grandmother implied she was improper and should starve herself because it's unladly like to have boobs.   \n\nJust because ops grandma is from \"the older generation\" does not excuse her behavior. \n\nIm not trying to be rude here, im curious.  Do you excuse racism from the elderly too?", ">Her grandmother deserves respect by way of being her grandmother.\n\nNo, she doesn't.
