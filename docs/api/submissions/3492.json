Calling her an old hag sounds childish.\n\nYou're both pretty disrespectful.", "Yes, YTA, though lacks INFO. I'm sure hearing those things from your grandmother wasn't pleasant but she's an old woman, from a different cultural era and possibly not altogether there if she is changing her mind on your eating habits within the same sitting. Most of us begin to fade to some degree at that age. Most importantly, she's the reason you exist, the reason you can post on here. She's probably been through far more than you know and no doubt took some unpleasant comments from her own G-ma and others at your age. Young people were expected to take their verbal lumps with some level of good grace in many cultures, and if they were catching poor words they tended to change to adhere to family/cultural norms. Doesn't make it okay or less disagreeable, simply what was. We also lack a little info on the situation, when she called you a \"whore\" for \"having boobs\" were you wearing something revealing or tight fitting that would offend her older/ more modest sensibilities? When you were eating, were you wolfing food down like a fat guy at a wings joint? \n\nI also wouldn't categorize her comments as \"spiteful\" despite their rudeness. Spitefulness is intentional malice, and her comments, however off-putting, display concern with your welfare. \"Putting meat on your bones\" is an old standby, simply means they worry you don't eat enough. 'Looking unladylike' is a worry that you'll scare off potential suitors. \n\nFinally, I think what puts you in TA category is the way you responded. You could have stood your ground if you weren't willing to take those words from your elder, and simply said the first part, \u201cstop speaking to me that way,\" and you would have been justified. Adding the rest was unnecessary and somewhat petulant. Shes family, for better or worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
