{"id": 21900, "submission_id": "14wc0ch", "title": "AITA for getting my brother in law kicked out for his weird behavior?", "selftext": "\n\nI (23F) just married my husband (27M) about five months ago but we\u2019ve been dating for three years before. He has an older half brother (31M) David who my husband was really close with. David spends a lot of time at our house because his wife and him have disagreements from time to time and he stays in our guest room and we host him gladly.\n\nNow I\u2019ll get into the title, the first reason is because my brother in law compliments me a whole lot and never fails to put down his wife with these comments and it makes me quite uncomfortable. He says things such as \u201cmy wife could never cook like this\u201d \u201cI wish my wife had hair and skin like yours\u201d(I\u2019m black and his wife is Russian). Another reason is the way he\u2019ll find any way to touch me and just recently my husband and father in law called him out about his behavior but he just denies and says that he\u2019s just happy he has a sister finally(my husband has all brothers). \n\nBut the biggest reason is a situation that took place a week ago. My husband was at work and I was at home and my brother in law was at my home as well. I had just finished working out with my best friend and I assumed he was still sleeping but he wasn\u2019t. I had just finished working out so I was sweating really bad and I went to the kitchen to get water and he was cooking. I said hi and he smiled I didn\u2019t think anything about it until he said \u201cnow I know what you look like after my brother finishes.\u201d I stood there frozen and he just laughed. I walked out after that to uncomfortable to even say anything back. \n\nMaybe this is where I was the asshole. I called my husband crying because I was so uncomfortable my husband reassured me on the phone he\u2019d deal with it and not to worry. My husband came home personally and kicked him out I think me crying fueled my husband\u2019s anger because he was insulting David for a long time down stairs . David was livid and said I was to sensitive over a harmless joke. \n\nDavid hasn\u2019t been back to our house since and my husband refuses to take me anywhere he is so we missed Fourth of July which made my mother in law sad so I took her out for lunch and she told me that David\u2019s biological mom is claiming that her son is being treated differently now because he\u2019s not fully related to my husband and his little brother.  \n\nShe and David are claiming that I\u2019m the asshole for playing victim and using my woman tears to fuel my husband\u2019s resentment and kick his brother out. Mostly everyone is on my side my Mother and Father in law are neutral and my younger brother in law and his girlfriend are both on my side. \n\nI just needed outside advice because I\u2019m starting to feel bad. But anyway am I the asshole for making the situation more dramatic???", "created_utc": 1689036653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wc0ch/aita_for_getting_my_brother_in_law_kicked_out_for/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

David's behaviour is creepy and gross. Not just the overcomplementing and comparing his wife unfavorably to yiu but touching you all the time and inappropriate comments. The fact that your FIL and hubby had already called him out on it...he knew his behaviour was out of bounds and he still behaved in a disrespectful manner. This isn't something preteen with a crush being awkward...this is a middleaged man who knows his actions and words make you uncomfortable and he does not care. He enjoys it. And left unchecked...he will escalate and not take any responsibility...it won't be his fault because he \"had a couple drinks\", you  \"misinterpreted him\" you \"led him on\" etc./s \n  Do not let him in your home again, do not let him be alone with you ever.", "NTA \n\nChange the locks on your house", "David is a creep.

And now he has enlisted his mother to apply peer pressure on you to further bully you. He is hoping to make you back down and apologize, that way he can move in again, perhaps doing worse, and then no one will believe you when you accuse him again.", "NTA.

He has repeatedly sexually harassed you and been called out on it before. You have been very gracious in your previous handling of his actions, but he way overstepped this time.

OP, think back to every compliment he has given to you that compare you to his wife, when he complimented your looks, the excuses he has made to touch you. He is a predator and you have been his prey for a very long time. Your husband has likely suspected this and this comment solidified it for him.

It's not typical for black men to go after white women and then make comments about the hair and skin of black women the way he did. So from one black woman in an interracial relationship    with a white man to another, you did NOTHING wrong. You were being openly fetishized and it creeped you out and your husband handled it exactly how he was supposed to. And then, in typical white privilege fashion, the tears started rolling and he ran to mommy when he didn't get away with it. My husband's family is from Indiana. They either fetishize or they're racist. There's like three people in his family that I can name that are actually cool and like me for me. One being my father in law and the other two being his brothers.", "NTA.  He's a creep, your husband handled it correctly, and you deserve to feel safe in your own home.  Full stop.", "NTA.

He was getting too comfortable at their house so this happening is for the best.  Now just try to avoid him for awhile, not just physically but also mentally, don't give him any energy.  The hubby sounds like a good guy, it is sad when spouses don't stick up for each other, which is often the issue at AITA.", "Exactly. If you have to explain that it was a joke, then it wasn't a joke.", "Tell your MIL and David to pack in the crocodile tears, he has been  sexually harassing you in your own home, and everyone else agrees that\u2019s enough now. \nHe waits until you\u2019re alone in a room and behaves inappropriately towards you. \nThe outcome is entirely his doing for being a creep, not yours.

A misunderstanding is something that can happen once, the person apologizes and doesn't do it again. If it keeps happening (with several of your husband's girlfriends', and multiple times with you), it's not a misunderstanding.", "I didn\u2019t mean to allot women to things it was also other stuff as well with their child hood and how things have been dealt with by their parents.", "It wasn\u2019t you who did.
