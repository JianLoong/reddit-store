{"id": 21900, "submission_id": "14wc0ch", "title": "AITA for getting my brother in law kicked out for his weird behavior?", "selftext": "\n\nI (23F) just married my husband (27M) about five months ago but we\u2019ve been dating for three years before. He has an older half brother (31M) David who my husband was really close with. David spends a lot of time at our house because his wife and him have disagreements from time to time and he stays in our guest room and we host him gladly.\n\nNow I\u2019ll get into the title, the first reason is because my brother in law compliments me a whole lot and never fails to put down his wife with these comments and it makes me quite uncomfortable. He says things such as \u201cmy wife could never cook like this\u201d \u201cI wish my wife had hair and skin like yours\u201d(I\u2019m black and his wife is Russian). Another reason is the way he\u2019ll find any way to touch me and just recently my husband and father in law called him out about his behavior but he just denies and says that he\u2019s just happy he has a sister finally(my husband has all brothers). \n\nBut the biggest reason is a situation that took place a week ago. My husband was at work and I was at home and my brother in law was at my home as well. I had just finished working out with my best friend and I assumed he was still sleeping but he wasn\u2019t. I had just finished working out so I was sweating really bad and I went to the kitchen to get water and he was cooking. I said hi and he smiled I didn\u2019t think anything about it until he said \u201cnow I know what you look like after my brother finishes.\u201d I stood there frozen and he just laughed. I walked out after that to uncomfortable to even say anything back. \n\nMaybe this is where I was the asshole. I called my husband crying because I was so uncomfortable my husband reassured me on the phone he\u2019d deal with it and not to worry. My husband came home personally and kicked him out I think me crying fueled my husband\u2019s anger because he was insulting David for a long time down stairs . David was livid and said I was to sensitive over a harmless joke. \n\nDavid hasn\u2019t been back to our house since and my husband refuses to take me anywhere he is so we missed Fourth of July which made my mother in law sad so I took her out for lunch and she told me that David\u2019s biological mom is claiming that her son is being treated differently now because he\u2019s not fully related to my husband and his little brother.  \n\nShe and David are claiming that I\u2019m the asshole for playing victim and using my woman tears to fuel my husband\u2019s resentment and kick his brother out. Mostly everyone is on my side my Mother and Father in law are neutral and my younger brother in law and his girlfriend are both on my side. \n\nI just needed outside advice because I\u2019m starting to feel bad. But anyway am I the asshole for making the situation more dramatic???", "created_utc": 1689036653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wc0ch/aita_for_getting_my_brother_in_law_kicked_out_for/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

David's behaviour is creepy and gross. Not just the overcomplementing and comparing his wife unfavorably to yiu but touching you all the time and inappropriate comments. The fact that your FIL and hubby had already called him out on it...he knew his behaviour was out of bounds and he still behaved in a disrespectful manner. This isn't something preteen with a crush being awkward...this is a middleaged man who knows his actions and words make you uncomfortable and he does not care. He enjoys it. And left unchecked...he will escalate and not take any responsibility...it won't be his fault because he \"had a couple drinks\", you  \"misinterpreted him\" you \"led him on\" etc./s \n  Do not let him in your home again, do not let him be alone with you ever.", "NTA \n\nChange the locks on your house", "David is a creep. Does he have keys to your house? \n\nNTA", "NTA. Trust your instincts - he was being entirely inappropriate, and he has been leading up to this for a long time.\n\nAlso understand - \"It was just a joke\" is the common fallback when abusers are called out on their behavior to try to turn guilt back on their victims. And now he has enlisted his mother to apply peer pressure on you to further bully you. He is hoping to make you back down and apologize, that way he can move in again, perhaps doing worse, and then no one will believe you when you accuse him again.", "NTA. Your husband threw him out because he was being very inappropriate with you. It wasn't a harmless joke, you didn't misunderstand, and neither did your husband.", "NTA NTA NTA!!\n\nDude this guy is a total slime. He may or may not be manipulating or lying to his mother. Your MIL should not have made it your problem. \n\nThat is NOT a harmless joke. Especially with the other context.", "Nta your brother in law was being creepy", "NTA\n\nYou have been a victim of his sentiments, objectivism, and judgment. He's made comments about your looks and sex life.  He's made you uncomfortable in your own home. He's made his brother feel uncomfortable about the comments he makes about his brother's wife. None of this is on you. \n\nYou are questioning yourself because you are kind. But you put up with behaviors that were gross because you let them slide due to your questioning if he was just \"being nice\"... he wasn't.   He was being gross. \n\nTime to draw boundaries. You have the right to be strong and gorgeous and not have a gross man comment on them.", "\"using my woman tears\" -- what the heck ?\n\nDavid is TA. anyone who sides with David is TA. you are NTA.\n\nwhy are people still entertaining David after this ??", "NTA probably your own husband was waiting for the comments to go that far because what he said about your cooking he can say was a compliment also about your skin and hair could be taken in various ways but this was blunt out disgusting and your husband was waiting for something so direct to have the motive to do this also by the way it seems your BIL has more history then you know that probably was the last straw for what your husband was already feeling , hey maybe he has done this with other women and probably you don't know", "NTA. He has repeatedly sexually harassed you and been called out on it before. You have been very gracious in your previous handling of his actions, but he way overstepped this time. Your feelings are valid and you have every right to be comfortable in your own home. I'm sorry people are trying to make you feel otherwise.", "NTA\n\nThat is completely inappropriate, and honestly kind of racist behavior. As someone who is mixed race, and constantly gets the \"you look so exotic\" comments, just reading what you wrote about his comments on your skin, and hair made my skin crawl. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, and I'm glad your husband is the kind of person who has your back in this, because your BIL is super creepy.", "NTA. He went way over the line. If you do decide in the future to go places he is, make sure there\u2019s no way he can get near you. He\u2019s a pervert.", "Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

Dude's a creep, keep him out of your life as much as possible.", "No he doesn\u2019t thankfully", "This! OP, think back to every compliment he has given to you that compare you to his wife, when he complimented your looks, the excuses he has made to touch you. He is a predator and you have been his prey for a very long time. Your husband has likely suspected this and this comment solidified it for him. NTA.", "My husband definitely has been waiting just from the comments I herd him say. Their relationship is really complicated because of family dynamics and my brother in law has always felt like he got the short end of the stick when it comes to things.", "He has had issues in the past with some of my husbands girlfriends but nothing like this. I honestly think he has a issue with not caring about women\u2019s boundaries the more I look at it. He had told me those were misunderstandings and I should\u2019ve really took that as a sign."]}
