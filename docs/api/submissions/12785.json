I just mean that I hate when people get called for asking something that isnt all that dramatic in the first place.

I imagined that if they were in a plane in the situation, they could have a completely different situation, including one which may be that the seats didnt cost extra (have actually never heard of seats costing extra from other seats in the same row anyway tbh). I was saying that that type of situation would be reasonable, and I dont rhink simply asking would be a problem. Same with many other situations, related or unrelated to planes. I have stated multiple times that I was talking about a slightly different situation than the original post. The woman in this post is TA and unreasonable frkm the get go for asking for something someone else paid extra for, and for letting her daughter sit in that seat *before* she even asked whether it would be okay or not. I said multiple times that *if* it were not extra, or even if the person asking didnt even realize it was extra, and was told later, it wouldnt be unreasonable to simply ask. Of course, in the situation that the person asked not realizing the seat was extra, I dont rhink theyd be unreasonable for asking because they didnt know, but once informed it would be unreasonable to push the question further. I just see so many posts about a person (usually a parent) asking a simple little thing and them being called unreasonable and entitled for just asking. Like they'll literally just ask small and the answer will immediately be like \"no I'm not obligated to do that you're so entitled\"  instead of just \"no, sorry.\" Like asking isnt the problem, asking doesnt imply that they think they're entitled to it, but the way the react to the answer no will imply whether or not they're entitled. (Again, assuming the request was reasonable. And *again*, I'm not saying that the woman in the post was reasonable, she clearly knew that the cost was extra already and didnt care, I'm talking about situations of requests that would be a bit more reasonable)", "i don't think you understand that there are plenty of people who either suffer from social anxiety, or are extremely non-confrontational to the point where they will feel intimidated enough to give up what they originally wanted just to 'people please' or not cause a scene, or appear to be rude etc. i'm not one of those people and would have absolutely no qualms at all about saying no, this is the seat i picked (whether i had to pay extra for it or not). but i am most certainly aware that there are PLENTY of people who would feel it would be 'impolite' to refuse a request, ESPECIALLY if it is something a child is asking for.\n\nso yes, the mere asking for a 'favor' from a total stranger in a situation like this is just flat out annoying. does the mother think OP just blindly stumbled into that seat, not even realizing she was sitting at a window? of course not. they obviously picked that seat for a reason and shouldn't be made to feel like there is even the tiniest bit of pressure to give it up.", "I do understand that, and even thought to mention people pleasers and such. That is why I specifically stated that it is not unreasonable to ask something if it is clear that they can decline and that the person asking is doing nothing to make it seem like they would be violent or angry or even just annoying if they declined. How the hell is someone supposed to know that another person suffers from anxiety or something? Like I said, somebody's reaction to being asked something doesnt make somebody and AH for asking it unless they somehow knew they would respond that way. Like man if I asked somebody if they could pick up the pencil I dropped because it is closer to them and they wouldnt have to get up and I would, how would I be the AH for that person being bad at confrontation, and didnt actually want to pick up the pencil cuz they're back hurt, but did it anyway, unless I was specifically abusing that (which would require knowing them). Like thats not really the person who asked fault. If I was talking to a stranger mentioned that I had a cat, and they happened to have a genuine phobia of cats and started getting scared by the mention of a cat, would I be at fault that they had a bad reaction to a common situation or conversation topic? No. They may not be able to control the reaction, but I would also have no way of knowing they would have that reaction.  And there is no way of knowing until you find out by accidentally causing that. If I were to continue to talk about cats, knowing it was scaring them, yes I would be an AH. Just like if I knew someone had trouble saying no and always took advantage of it. But tiptoeing around people and not asking things that may be reasonable and common to ask of someone, simply because they might have anxiety or troubles with saying no, is stupid as hell. Hell, I've said yes to things I didnt eant to do before. Am I a little upset at doing the thing, sure, but the reality is that I said yes, and didn't want to confront by refusing after accepting. Is the person who asked me an AH for asking. No, why would they be, they had no idea I wouldnt answer honestly. Am I mad at them for asking? No, again unless I see a pattern of them constantly asking me to do things knowing that I wont say no.
