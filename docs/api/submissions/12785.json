I just mean that I hate when people get called for asking something that isnt all that dramatic in the first place.

I would have just paid for a window seat so my kid could look out of it instead of trying to bully someone out of theirs.", "I'm a parent and you are NTA! That was an entitled AH parent and not your problem.", "NTA. As a parent of two, joust pay for the seat you want. Like jfc", "NTA - I do not get it.  I purposefully pay for EVERY flight (even if I can only get the seats in the back) to ensure we have a middle and a window.  I don't know why she didn't give her kid the aisle at least.", "NTA and  I would have called for the flight attendant if the kid was touching me, and the mother refused to do anything. I book the seat I want, and that's where I sit. I always booked a window seat for one kid and an aisle seat for the other.\n~mom of 2 (now adults)", "NTA. I once gave up my window seat for a bratty child with an MIA parent a row back. Child fell asleep during takeoff and left the window shutters rolled down the entire flight. Never looked out the damn window once.\n\nNot doing that again.", "I would have told her to keep her daughter in her seat and not to let her crawl over to see out the window.", "NTA! I don\u2019t even understand how this is such the problem that it keeps coming up over and over! If you pay for and choose a seat it\u2019s your seat! If the only seat left is the middle then you are SOL and you sit in the middle! So freaking simple.", "Honestly (I love children) I would've kicked the kid the fuck off my lap. As sad as it is, if you can't afford it, you can't afford it. And from what the mother said it sounds like she could have and depended on charity. Not your problem.", "NTA - I\u2019m tired of some parents thinking their kids are the centre of not just their lives but everyone else\u2019s as well.        \nI would not have swapped either.        \nI pay for seats I deserve to use them.        \nI tho would not have let the kid climb on me.       \nYou were too kind and accomodating", "YTA- To the mom who thought because she didn\u2019t want to pay extra, she\u2019s entitled to take someone else\u2019s seat!!!", "NTA OP. I would have pulled the blind shut and told the woman to control her crotch spawn.", "NTA and you should have called the flight attendant to have her remind the woman that her child did not belong on your lap or anywhere in the space you paid for.", "NTA - have kids. You are right. If she wanted a window, pay for it.", "NTA", "NTA. It was your seat that you paid for...", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to pay for me or my kid to sit at a window seat. So much entitlement", "Definitely NTA! I've got four kids, and that's some entitled bs. It's not even like there was an issue of her having to sit separately from her kid if you sat in your seat. Some people need to give their heads a shake. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. TBH, I would have called for a flight attendant to make the entitled mother get her child off of me. You are much more patient than I would have been about it. \n\nIt's not so hard to pay a $20 fee if you're able to pay for flights anyway.", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom. I would NEVER. My kid wouldn\u2019t either. Granted she\u2019s 17 now. But she\u2019d be as disgusted as me at this behavior", "NTA", "NTA. You should have nicely asked the child to get off of you.", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to the things you paid for without your consent. \nThe lady\u2019s whining flies in the face of reasonable requests.", "I did the same. So much easier.", "I like your story. Thank you. I\u2019m off to buy red bull and candy in preparation for my flight tomorrow. I\u2019m thinking about making a pretty new puppy certificate just in case I need it.", "But but, where is the intrigue? Where is annoying other passengers? Where\u2019s the fight? Why don\u2019t you try to conquer someone else\u2019s seat? Not allowing your toddler to crawl over another person like an amusement park. I don\u2019t understand.", "Cough loudly on the child", ">ave me different looks. Some looked at me discussed, another showed me a thumbs up. During the flight, the child basically climbed on me to look outside, it was soooo annoying!!!\n\nRight! My mother would be sitting on me if I was crawling on a stranger - I don't recall getting to choose or \"want\" anything on a flight as a kid.", "Too be fair, most parents don\u2019t do this shit, but it\u2019s no fun to post about them because they aren\u2019t AH nor engaged in potentially AH behavior. We only take note of the shitty people.", "I'm closing the shutter - the mom did too much putting the kid in that position.", "Mom bought you Taylor swift tickets in Hawaii!", "Next time - you don\u2019t need to have a back and forth, nor do you need to justify yourself. \n\nOn future flights just call the flight attendant and let them deal with it.\n\nIf the kid tries to crawl into your seat put the armrest up. \n\nIf the kid still tries to get into your seat get the flight attendant and explain the situation. \n\nIf the situation doesn\u2019t change, call the flight attendant back and ask that mother and kid switch seats so there\u2019s an adult human barrier between the two of you or that they get those kids seats with a seatbelt. \n\nNTA by a mile.", "Kid is putting hands, and feet and elbows etc, on OP.", "Talk to the child about how scared you are of flying and dream about crashing to the ground.", "This may be because this is AITA. The good guys aren\u2019t normally a topic of discussion here. Which is why being here is so entertaining.", "I think it\u2019s more than just this sub\u2026 just look at the news. It\u2019s mostly negative and about sad terrible events or people being AH.", "It is completely unreasonable to ask for a privilege you aren\u2019t willing to pay the extra 20.00 more for."]}
