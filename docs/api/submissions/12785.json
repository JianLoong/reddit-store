I think in situations like this it's not necessarily entitled or unreasonable to ask (if this were a situation where she didnt pay extra for seats, or where the mother didnt realize it or offered to give her a 20 or something). But making them out to be the ah because they said no is entitled in most situations.

It should be clear that you will not hold anything against them for saying no as they have every right to, even if you are a bit sad it didnt go your way (as you cant control how you feel about that, but you can still be reasonable and understand that they shouldn't be expected to change their plans because you weren't prepared)", "I'd have closed the window if the mother couldn't control her kid.", "Why bother when she can steal someone else\u2019s", "Nice idea.

I just mean that I hate when people get called for asking something that isnt all that dramatic in the first place. Like if I was at a window seat and it didnt cost extra, I wouldn't consider someone entitled for asking politley if we could trade.

My late husband worked away our entire marriage and when he was not able to come home his scheduled time I made it a priority to go to him so my daughter had more airtime than many adults by the time she was 5. She loved window seats so I booked them whenever they were available and if not she knew to sit and not bother other people, just bother mama or she could talk if others engaged her.

If they said no she would accept the no because tantrums were a no that meant no movie and no good snacks she was normally not allowed at home. Did it always work?

Asking a small favor or something of a stranger isnt inherently 'being entitled.'

Again, super unreasonable requests, like asking to switch seats with someone in first class, for no reason other than they want to be in first class, would obviously be entirely unreasonable. Also, how is a person asking for a small favor supposed to know how the person they're asking is going to react to them asking? If somebody politely asks something, there is no reason to be concerned, especially in public, especially knowing that they would be in the wrong if they did give you something to be concerned about for saying no. Somebody being a pushover when somebody politely asked something, making it clear that they can decline, does not make the person who asked an ah unless they knew for a fact that the person would say yes regardless of what they actually wanted.", "Asking a stranger for a big favor is generally reserved for really important things, so it communicates that this is important enough to warrant it."]}
