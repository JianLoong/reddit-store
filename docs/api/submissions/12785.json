I think in situations like this it's not necessarily entitled or unreasonable to ask (if this were a situation where she didnt pay extra for seats, or where the mother didnt realize it or offered to give her a 20 or something). But making them out to be the ah because they said no is entitled in most situations. I mean I can imagine being mildly/visibly upset about being told no, cuz you cant control if that upsets you, but you can control if you understand that they dont have to say yes to and act accordingly and say 'ok no problem'", "There were no window seats left anymore.

Expecting them to actually say yes and arguing with them when they say no is definitely entitled and unreasonable tho. It should be clear that you will not hold anything against them for saying no as they have every right to, even if you are a bit sad it didnt go your way (as you cant control how you feel about that, but you can still be reasonable and understand that they shouldn't be expected to change their plans because you weren't prepared)", "I'd have closed the window if the mother couldn't control her kid.", "Why bother when she can steal someone else\u2019s", "Nice idea. But how would you collect? Would you trust her to go with you to an ATM after you landed? I wouldn't.", "No. Leave people to sit where they booked. A child has no greater need of a window seat than anyone else and the sooner they learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them the better.", "You did the right thing. I have a son who is 2 that likes to look out the window, we book him the window \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's that simple.", "The entitlement is also in asking, not just getting offended if the answer was no.

My bad.", "I specifically specified if the situation was that they offered to pay the difference or the window seat wasnt extra and they just didnt manage to book in time to get a window seat. In ops situation, the parent is definitely YTA because she clearly knew that the cost was extra and even went on to lie about there not being seats left when she booked. I just mean that I hate when people get called for asking something that isnt all that dramatic in the first place. Like if I was at a window seat and it didnt cost extra, I wouldn't consider someone entitled for asking politley if we could trade. I mean you never know if someone cares much about the window seat or if they absolutely wanted it unless you ask them if they would or wouldnt mind traded. Now if someone asked me and got mad at me for saying no, then I would think they're entitled, but if they asked and I said no and they were like \"fair enough\" and sat in their spot, I would just consider them as I do any other reasonable stranger I come by.", "Not at all. I'm old and don't think of ways to pay like that.", "Still on the ground before take off, still have 3g.....", "Nope. Kids aren\u2019t entitled to windows.", "Have you heard of cash?", "Actually, I haven't touched cash in years. I was thinking no one's going to carry enough cash to make it worthwhile to give up my seat."]}
