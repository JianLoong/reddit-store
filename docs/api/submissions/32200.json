I did as well. It wasn't until I moved across the country and met my wife and her family that I realized the constant teasing, negativity and tearing people down as a joke wasn't normal or funny.\n\nPlease think about this as you can see that your kids are already learning from you that this is ok.

Cooking is one of the spaces I recommend you not be playful like this again because obviously your wife finds it insulting and disrespectful. You made fun of your wife in front of your kids?
