She shouldn't be allowed to move in if that's the situation but I'd suggest trying to get out of there. Is there another parent of family member you can stay with? That's probably your best bet", "NTA and your sister and mom both needs to address the issue. Looks like shes becoming a liability and more of a pain.", "Your adult sister either needs to relocate for privacy or accept she has none for sleeping in living room! \nNTA, but your sister IS.", "NTA. Who would want to live like that? If you have another option I would take it. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nWhy doesn't your mother set some rules for Bailey? Why does she get to kick everyone out of the family room 24/7? Is she allowed to stay there for as long as she wants, and does she seem to have any goal like getting a job/getting a new place?\n\nBecause if she doesn't, she'll be there for years. Guessing she can move in with Mary now.", "and i would also like to say  she swears a lot (my mom is very strict, we cant even say butt). An example of her being rude, she came homelast week and screamed for me to turn on the living room light, but I didn't know she was talking to me. She yelled \"turn on the f\\*cking light before i make mom give me your room\" and continued to swear and yell at  me and my little sister.t", "NTA i would want her gone too", "Nta sounds like some healthy boundaries need to be put in the place. A living room isn\u2019t the place to turn into a bedroom. It\u2019s a central place for everyone. I think staying wirh your dad is a perfect option.", "NTA, you should stay with your dad, no need to deal with all the drama", "NTA. She coming into your home and trying to control it. The place where she is staying is a living room which is a public area in the house. I would tell her it sucks to suck bc she made this decision herself. She's 22, she shouldn't be acting like that, truly embarrassing for her.", "NTA. Move out if you can!", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
