At first, we shrugged it off and figured we could simply push them against each other, but we quickly found out that the headboards of the beds were drilled to the wall.

He agreed and we booked us a room at a hotel a few towns away.\n\nMy MIL has accused us of ruining her husband\u2019s birthday and \"dividing the family\", because two of my husband\u2019s siblings support our decision.

That is a simple no brainer", "This assumes that the owners of the house got a proper separated headboard.", "Bold of you to assume he considers his homophobic mother as part of his support system.", "You\u2019re not being very subtle by constantly calling him a stereotype. We all get what you mean", "If his mother can't accept him for who he is then she's not his support system and neither is the father or siblings if they stand behind her.", "Joining your husband\u2019s family for a weeklong vacation is hardly the first step in isolating your husband from said family.  Try again.", "Are you MIL? Cause you seem to be the only person agreeing with her.", "Is all of your comments you are reaching SO far to try and make a completely NORMAL reaction seem abusive. \n\nAre you OP's MIL?\n\nSeriously, if I paid in part for my partner and I to go on a family vacation and we got shafted like this, I would leave too. I'm not wasting my hard earned vacation time in a place where I feel less than.", "I know you're not trying to say that OP is trying to isolate his husband, in typical narcissistic behavior that dv assailants pursue.  Because that would be libelous, and just plain nutty.\n\nSeriously, do you need a nap or a snack or something?  Because you're coming across really unhinged.", "A couple months ago, I booked a beach house. It was hard enough just finding a place with the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the general location we wanted.  I think it's a stretch that she would have purposefully found a five-bedroom place with only one room with single beds AND would know that they were bolted into the wall/couldn't be moved. \n\nShe may be a homophobic jerk in generally but I really doubt this was intentional.", "I know you\u2019re joking, but FTR, gay couples do get married in progressive Christian churches. At the church my sister attends, the pastor is gay.", "She's clearly praying to a different God than mine.", "Yes exactly, noise reduction. Also decorative bed frames are expensive. It\u2019s much more cost effective for the hotel to spend money on upgrading just the headboard, beds/bedding etc - and keep the original bed frame. There are lots of options to get a nice clean bed base look rather than buying & paying a crew to install an entire hotels worth of bed bases.", "I'm not saying they HAVE to do anything. That's the point. I'm just saying *sometimes* you eat a shit sandwich. If they don't want to, don't. But then it leads to spending more money on a hotel, tension on a vacation, and a Reddit post.", "Old people say offensive shit. That's again not homophobia. Maybe they are clingy.", "Yes, I read it. That\u2019s why I stated that his MIL would have had no way of knowing the beds were bolted to the wall, so why would she have thought this would be a big deal?", "Without knowing what the remarks were, it\u2019s a huge stretch to assume that\u2019s why they were given this room. It\u2019s not even a given that the room with two twins is inherently worse: I\u2019d actually prefer to share two twins with my husband than a full-size bed, for instance.\n\nLike, OP literally opened the conversation with \u2018why didn\u2019t you get a house with enough double beds?\u2019 That was very combative and rude.", "It\u2019s not confirmed homophobia, it\u2019s just the op\u2019s opinion.", "They still had to pay for the rental? It\u2019s not clear. I don\u2019t see any refund.\n\nPlus, they paid extra for a hotel.", "It doesn\u2019t bother me if we are in twin beds at all. I don\u2019t see the problem.", "Then why does it matter?", "The reason to nail headboards to the wall is that they are not attached to the beds.  There are no headboards attached to walls that are also attached to beds.  No idea what you mean by proper separated headboard, but if it's attached to a bed there is literally no reason to attach it to a wall.", "I agree. She might not even have known when she booked it. They don\u2019t always have detailed floor plans.", "You always check the bedrooms when booking. I guarantee there was a picture of a room with 2 single beds.", "OP says MIL has a history of saying homophobic shit, she specifically tells him to stay away from her son, and calls him a walking stereotype.\n\nAny claim that it's just a coincidence that her gay child was given the single beds and not allowed to switch, is not credible. She is homophobic.", "I didn\u2019t say it was homophonic. I said it was disrespectful. You are correct old people do say offended shit. There is consequences to that. Just because they are old or family doesn\u2019t mean you excuse their behavior.", "Old people saying homophobic shit is literally homophobic. Besides the fact that 2 of the other siblings agrees with them about it. And calling him a \"walking stereotype\" seems homophobic since, you know, it is.", "Old people I know dont say \"offensive shit\". \n\nAssholes do.", "She's a 57 year old bigot, not some dementia-addled 92 year old. Stop making excuses for homophobes.", "She gave \"the gay couple\" the room with single beds to begin with. Then, when she found out the beds couldn't be moved, her response was \"stop clinging to my son and perpetuating stereotypes.\" Not, \"oh, well, maybe we all take turns sleeping in that room\" or \"maybe Joe & Sue wouldn't mind sleeping there then\" ... or any number of other responses that were not rude and homophobic.", "Thats assuming it was the start of the conversation and not after the discussion about not being able to move the beds and etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHomophobic remarks lead to homophobic actions. Like if it was a first come first serve type of deal then its on the OP and they are making a huge deal out of nothing. The mother assigning the bedrooms and specifically chosing that one for the gay couple with the history of making homophobic remarks and thus not approving of their lifestyle is very clearly evidence. Sure its not court of law evidence but its evidence enough for an informed opinion.", "sorry someone has to say \"I am a homophobe\" for it to be confirmed homophobia in your expert opinion", "His MILs words were facially homophobic, calling him a walking stereotype. Also your judgment is more than a little suspect here given that you're defending homophobia in the comments.", "because MIL is being homophobic by intentionally singling out the gay couple and assigning them the room with 2 single beds. why should OP and his husband subject themselves to that?", ">if it's attached to a bed there is literally no reason to attach it to a wall.\n\nUnless you want to keep people from moving the beds.", "Correct, and a large number of old people tend to be assholes.", "Not convinced it is homophobia, so not making excuses for anyone.", "OP went into the conversation being accusatory. That doesn\u2019t tend to make people inclined to compromise. Hence, ESH. Not sure what you\u2019re confused about.", "It\u2019s not an assumption, it\u2019s how OP describes himself starting the conversation. Basically, people are taking OP\u2019s assertion that she\u2019s homophobic and using it to justify any behavior he took, and that\u2019s just not valid.", "The beds can be moved, my friend.  Just not the headboards.  I have a hard time believing that the mother in law brought her toolbox and attached the beds to the headboards so that this married couple cannot sleep together.  Therefore, I am ASKING THE OP whether or not the actual beds were moveable.  And I noticed he hasn't answered.", "Says your anedoctal experiences", "I'm not confused about anything. You're just plain wrong.", "Except for it is not how he described as himself starting the conversation. It says \"I asked my MIL why she had chosen a house that ...\" where did it say it was the start of the conversation? And again what behavior his behavior was to get a hotel because he wanted a nice vacation week with his husband so went to a hotel that does not mean that the entire vacation is off. And then the mother and one sibling started sending them abuse. I legitemately dont know where you think the OP went wrong. Other than you trying to defend the mother was not homophobic (which sure lets say she wasnt it still does not excuse any of her behavior). But if she was not homophobic then them staying at a hotel should have been no big deal its not like they were asking the mom to pay for the hotel. But it is a big deal because she specifically got the rooms so she wouldnt have to think of them together.", "I edited my original post to add that the headboards were attached to both the wall and the bed frames, preventing us from moving the beds. I assume that that was the owners\u2019 intention to prevent damage to the flooring etc.", "Ok, thanks for sharing.", "They went to a hotel several towns away. Pretty sure they flounced on the whole vacation. This was not a \u2018we\u2019re going to stay nearby and still spend time with the family\u2019 kind of thing. The title literally says they left the vacation early.", "Thank you for answering.", "A few towns away does not mean that they arent going to do anything at all with the family because depending on where you are that could mean as little as 2 hours away (some areas it could be even shorter but I am going with an average based on vacation spots like lakes and etc). But after I got literally any abuse from them after I left for the hotel that is the exact moment I would have said fuck it we not doing anything with them the entire time and ended the vacation there. Sure it is an assumption on my part but compared to the assumptions your making it is a much smaller leap."]}
