At first, we shrugged it off and figured we could simply push them against each other, but we quickly found out that the headboards of the beds were drilled to the wall. (EDIT: The headboards were attached to both the wall and the bed frame. I assume it\u2019s to prevent renters from moving the beds and possibly damaging the flooring etc.)\n\nI asked my MIL why she had chosen a house that didn\u2019t have enough double beds to hold all of the couples that were invited and she told me to stop making a fuss because it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n\nI then asked why she hadn\u2019t mentioned it beforehand and she rolled her eyes at me, saying that I was overdramatic, a \"walking stereotype\" and that me not clinging to her son for a little while might be for the best.\n\nConsidering she has made some borderline homophobic comments in the past (she claims they\u2019re jokes), I was quite uncomfortable and based on her remarks, I felt like she had given the room with the single beds to the only gay couple on purpose.\n\nI said that if it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, surely she and her husband would be happy to switch rooms with us, but she once again told me that I should quit making a fuss and walked away from the conversation. \n\nAfterwards, my husband tried talking to his mother but he wasn\u2019t anymore successful than I had been and at this point, I was reaching my breaking point, so I asked my husband if he\u2019d like to spend our vacation at a hotel (as we had both taken the week off work anyway). He agreed and we booked us a room at a hotel a few towns away.\n\nMy MIL has accused us of ruining her husband\u2019s birthday and \"dividing the family\", because two of my husband\u2019s siblings support our decision.
