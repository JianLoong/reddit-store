I assume it\u2019s to prevent renters from moving the beds and possibly damaging the flooring etc.)\n\nI asked my MIL why she had chosen a house that didn\u2019t have enough double beds to hold all of the couples that were invited and she told me to stop making a fuss because it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n\nI then asked why she hadn\u2019t mentioned it beforehand and she rolled her eyes at me, saying that I was overdramatic, a \"walking stereotype\" and that me not clinging to her son for a little while might be for the best.\n\nConsidering she has made some borderline homophobic comments in the past (she claims they\u2019re jokes), I was quite uncomfortable and based on her remarks, I felt like she had given the room with the single beds to the only gay couple on purpose.\n\nI said that if it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, surely she and her husband would be happy to switch rooms with us, but she once again told me that I should quit making a fuss and walked away from the conversation. \n\nAfterwards, my husband tried talking to his mother but he wasn\u2019t anymore successful than I had been and at this point, I was reaching my breaking point, so I asked my husband if he\u2019d like to spend our vacation at a hotel (as we had both taken the week off work anyway). He agreed and we booked us a room at a hotel a few towns away.\n\nMy MIL has accused us of ruining her husband\u2019s birthday and \"dividing the family\", because two of my husband\u2019s siblings support our decision.

They're just houses which normally have a master and some smaller bedrooms. I've never heard of the planner giving people a heads up about specific aspects of a bedroom. It also doesn't make sense for MIL & FIL to switch rooms with you because this vacation is literally to celebrate FIL. I agree that it's weird that MIL assigned the rooms instead of it being first come, first serve but maybe she's just the type that prefers to plan vacations in detail.\n\nIt sounds like you have other issues with your MIL, and if your post was \"AITA for doing X after my MIL made a homophobic comment?\" I'd probably be on your side. But this really does sound like you overreacted to getting a room with a slightly different setup then you expected. You both had beds and were sleeping in the same room, it doesn't seem like she was trying to separate you.", "YTA. The point was a getaway with the family.

However, I usually choose to accommodate my sisters with their kids.  But no one in my family would ever assume that I should get the lousy room.  I think the bigger issue is that OP and the sin are married, but one if the sons is not yet married, but that son and his fianc\u00e9e got a proper bed.  Combine that with the nasty comments, and MIL and FIL(for not calling her out and setting her straight, at least) are the AHs!", "And the fact to this point that the youngest sibling is not married yet, clearly targeted.", "I would buy your argument about someone getting shafted if they were all married but it doesn't fly when there are 3 married couples and 3 rooms with shared beds, 1 unmarried couple and 1 singles bedroom. MIL did this on purpose showing favoritism/homophobia. Also if it's not that big of a deal and they are all splitting, why can't the MIL and FIL take that room?
