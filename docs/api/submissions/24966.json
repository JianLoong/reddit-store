Your daughter is out of her mind if she thinks she can dictate what all of her relatives do every Sunday afternoon, regardless of whether she \"means well\" or not.  Others should have supported you on the group text as I'm sure they feel the same way. This should be once a month MAX, attendance optional.

With football season starting soon f\\*ck off.", "NTA\n\nSorry but Lunch and Dinner every weekend requires a really close extended family. She has nice intentions but everyone has their own lives and schedules.

What started off as a nice gesture has become and obligation. I suspect the other invited guests feel the same as you do, fine once and a while, unnecessary every week.", "NTA. It sounds like she wants to establish herself as the family matriarch and host unbeknownst to you, her mother, or her MIL.", "NTA\n\nThat sounds utterly exhausting. You are allowed to decide how you want to spend your time. Suggesting a dinner a month was a great compromise idea, especially if it will help avoid everyone not showing up. If she wants to get upset over a very reasonable suggestion, that's on her.", "NTA of you don't want to go, don't go. I don't want to see anyone but my husband every week.", "NTA. Just go once a month, seeing as it\u2019s an open invite. No need to force yourself to go if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA. Every Sunday sounds like a lot. While it\u2019s nice to have family get togethers, people have things they want and need to do. Plus having to spend the time prepping something to bring can be a lot too\u2026 not that I mind people all bringing something when going to a meal like this\u2026 it just gets to be a lot when it is every week. You made a suggestion and she blew it out of proportion.", "I feel like there has to be more to this, it is such a reasonable thing to say, and an easy \"you can come once a month\" response for her to act this way.", "NTA\n\nThat said, this situation gives me the feeling that there's more going on. Maybe she hosts these lunches to feel closer to her loved ones. Also seems like others bailing out pinches a nerve for her, so your timing is both good and bad. \n\nGood in that the best time to mention something is when something happens so they can see your point.\n\nBad in that her reaction tells me she didn't take them bailing out well, so bringing that up before she cooled off could have set her off. \n\nMight be good to talk with her about what those lunches mean to her, why she hosts them, and what she hopes to get out of it. You're not obligated to go, but if she's expecting it, then that's a recipe for a fight down the road. Think it over and talk it over with someone first. \"I love you, but...\" probably won't go well.\n\n\"Noticed I might've hurt your feelings the other day, and even though I didn't mean to, I'm really sorry I did. I get the feeling these lunches are important to you. I also get the feeling from what you said last time that there's more to this. Any chance you wouldn't mind sharing a bit more?\"\n\nI have a complicated relationship with my dad. He thinks he sees and knows everything, so when I snap at him, he just calls me 'sensitive'. He's been doing it so many years, he doesn't even know something is up. He yells at me for not calling, but I didn't call because he's rude. As a result, I tend to snap at him over what feels like nothing and he is always bewildered. He's never asked about it and just avoids the subject if I bring it up, so when I snap at him, I kind of hope it'll give him a reason to.", "She acted like that after you said something very reasonable.  Every Sunday is way too much.  We have get togethers planned at my home a few times a year, and even that feels like a lot.

You can't over-do them. \n\nNTA", " NTA\nShe needs therapy.", "This sounds like she and her husband had this idealized view of big Sunday family dinner and are oblivious to the reality that the idea really only benefits her and her husband.  Nice for them to get to see both their families at once and presumably not have to cook in order to host, but they haven\u2019t picked up on the part where you and the in laws may not want to be stuck together every Sunday just to please them and have to potluck on top of it all. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut maybe you should have a talk to figure out what this is really about.", "This sounds very manipulative, either that or there\u2019s a longer version of the story, how does you suggesting making it once a month turn to her saying what she said and snapping like that?\n\nSounds like someone who wants things ONLY her way, and if it doesn\u2019t go that way then other people are assholes.", "NTA. Start going only once per week. They just want an easy lunch.", "My family (including my mom, brother and his whole family of 5) have family dinner every week, usually on the weekend. We rotate it around from house to house so no one family cooks all the time. Sometimes, we do a potluck where we take the luck out of the equation, and each of us brings a planned/coordinated dish. \n\nWe started family dinners during the pandemic, and just never stopped. It's been good to get together like this. Sometimes we miss, due to multiple people being out of town, but in general we get together. \n\nThe biggest difference is that each household has good cooks (my brother, my husband and my mom). We always eat exceptionally well. Maybe OP could talk to his daughter about hosting at their house one Sunday, or more intentionally splitting cooking duties. \n\nIf OP doesn't want to see their daughter once a week, I'd see how his daughter would be hurt. The whole burst of no contact threat is a little bizarre and emotional.  \n\nNTA for not wanting to go to a lunch that's not tasty. But seriously, sit down with daughter and find out where she's coming from. What is she really trying to do with her family dinner? If she wants more time with you, maybe you book a dinner out once a week and invite just her family (so you're not always hanging with the in-laws).", "EDIT: In light of clarification, NTA.\n\nI could go either way on this, but I'd err lightly on the side of YTA. \n\nYou're under no obligation to attend, obviously. If you don't want to go you don't want to go, and that's no one's business but yours.\n\nHowever, do consider what her intentions (probably) are. She's requesting quality time with her family. It's a lot of quality time, I'll grant you, but it's not inherently unreasonable. Connection is really important to a lot of people on an emotional level, and she probably sees the dinner as a way to get closer with you and bring the family together.\n\nWith that in mind, brushing her off in this way definitely seems like it would sting. While I don't know exactly how you went about it, it seems to me like she understood your comment to be a straightforward rejection of this very personal request. I don't think I'd respond the way she did, but if I reached out to my father with a similar request and got something along the lines of \"maybe we shouldn't see each other quite that much\" I'd definitely be hurt (barring bad personal history, of course). The implication would seem to be that he didn't like being around me enough to take showing up seriously. There were probably ways to decline that didn't require doing this. What's stopping you from just showing up monthly, for example?\n\nTldr you don't owe her your attendance, but your comment seems like it was an unnecessarily critical response to a very genuine and harmless request.", "YTA if you don't want to participate in family time with your daughter, then just don't. You don't need to try and make her feel like she's made a mistake for trying.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, don't offer unsolicited criticism.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can say no, or say you have plans, but it might just be better to say that while you do like family time, between helping her with kids during week and then the expectation of mea/get together EVERY weekend is too much for you.

We will still see each other 2-3 times per week", "I don\u2019t mind participating, but it is the guilt trip of not participating EVERY weekend that I resent", "It doesn\u2019t sound like OP is offering criticism, rather a suggestion. The daughter flipped out at the suggestion.", "How is making a suggestion a criticism, I thought it was a suggestion.  If I had said, \u201creally stupid trying to do this every week, just do it once a month\u201d THAT would be a criticism and worthy of being called an asshole", "Her husband? \n\nBecause that means she expects everyone to accommodate their schedule, but isn\u2019t willing to respect other people\u2019s schedules.", "Ah, I see. In that light, it's even murkier. I understand where you're coming from more now. I would probably say NTA then. It's definitely moreso a reaction to the planning of the specific meal itself, and unless you phrased it badly I don't see why she would take it as anything more.", "I wouldn't want to spend that much of every weekend like that either lol. But when you sound like you're speaking for everyone, I'm sure it makes her feel attacked. A better approach would have been \"I can't do this weekend either. It's been hard for me to try and do every week. I think I could commit to the last Sunday of every month though.\" \n\nAnd then you wait for feedback from everyone else. That way it's a more organic discussion and less everyone crushing her unrealistic dreams of a super close extended family.", "Constructional criticism is still criticism. She's putting a lot of effort into something that isn't being received positively, and you straight up told her no one wants to participate so much. Of course it hurt her feelings. It would have been much better relieved if you used the sandwich method. Compliment, criticism, compliment. \n\nThat's pretty standard for when you have something negative to convey, even if it's something necessary. People are emotional creatures."]}
