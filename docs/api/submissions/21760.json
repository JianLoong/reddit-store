M got the drink for the customer and the customer immediately looked at M with disgust. Reason being the drink had literal mold yes MOLD collected at the bottom of the drink. The customer then decided she wasn\u2019t thirsty anymore and walked out. Then I asked M how old the drinks in the fridge were. she just said \u201cI don\u2019t know ask the boss.\u201d So I texted my boss and she immediately called M. M walked out of the store while she was on the phone with my boss and when she came back in she said, \u201csince that is your main focus right now check all the drinks for mold.\u201d In a really pissed of voice. So I went ahead and did so and found 4 other drinks covered in mold. She then refused to talk to me for the rest of our 6 hour shift and made me do evening when closing the store.

When working in the food catering industry, keeping track of the quality of the food is A BIG BIG THING. It is what you sell to customers, you can't make them sick!!!\n\nEven if your coworker didn't told you to ask the boss, boss had to be told about the situation, so good on you for texting!\n\nAs for coworker, looks like she didn't want to take care of the issue and was pissed things had to be taken care off.", "NTA you literally looked out for your customers health and tried to not kill them.. what usually everyone working with food should prioritize. You did absolutely nothing wrong and frankly, your boss can be glad that the customer didnt call any health department and instead just left. Funny how they are mad at you for looking out for customers and the buisness while they fail to realize that they could literally loose the buinsness which would make yall jobless.", "Update 1 of many: I\u2019ve contacted my local Food and Health department and will let you know of any further information.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There needs to be some serious changes.  your co worker needs to grow up and act like an adult.", "It was fs ur teammates job to keep an eye on that. If you quit make sure to have in writing you\u2019re quitting because of a hostile work environment which started when you checked your drinks for mold after a customer found mold in their drink", "> She then refused to talk to me for the rest of our 6 hour shift and made me do evening when closing the store. \n\nWTF? Thats when you call the boss again. tell the boss you found more mold in the drinks, and now M is asking like an idiot. \n\nStand up for yourself.", "NTA but seriously you boss is, obviously she\u2019s not doing checks or making sure her store is regularly cleaned and stock checked", "NTA.  Not only were those moldy drinks a health code violation in most places but were likely to make someone sick if they ingested them.  All of which could amount to serious exposure to lawsuits or costly shut downs.  The boss should absolutely be informed\u2026and your 32 year old coworker\u2019s disinterest in the problem is pretty concerning too.", "NTA at all.  There are things bosses might not need to know sometimes, but major issues like food safety are definitely not in that category.  Your coworker is upset she got caught slacking.  You absolutely did the right thing.  CYA is like rule one for me.", "NTA - good for you for speaking up", "NTA - Is your boss pissed? It seems like maybe everyone else is because you made them look bad to your boss.", "NTA. \n\nGood job on speaking up though and looking out for the customer.", "NTA\n\ni.. what... huh?! what was your coworker even pissed off about?? she didn't go through the drinks to check for the mold since she got you to do it. \n\ni mean, maybe the boss chewed her out for it, if she's senior to you and expected to monitor the stock/use by dates/etc? but that's still no reason to be pissed at you. \n\nalso M *TOLD* you to contact the boss about the drinks, so she has no right to be pissy that the boss was contacted about the matter.", "NTA. Your coworker *told* you to ask the boss how old the drinks were, so you did. I'm assuming that M has seniority, so she should have been the one to check all the remaining drinks for mold. \n\nSounds like she doesn't care about the business or your customers. You did the right thing.", "the mold was inside the drink", "i didn\u2019t but i think i am. that\u2019s not the only problem there inside the basement there is literal fiberglass hanging out from the ceiling i\u2019m working there again wednesday and i\u2019ll be sure to take pictures", "Nta. Of course not. If your boss or anyone retaliates call the health department and report it, take pics next time if anything expired being served or stored. Sounds like a toxic and unsafe place.", "Tell them if it\u2019s not such a big deal they should drink the mold infested drinks. \n\nHow gross of them to think this is okay and that you\u2019re a jerk. Have you considered calling the health department? Sounds as if maybe no food should be consumed from this little restaurant.", "my boss tried to shrug it off like it was nothing but i\u2019ve reported the location to my food and health department because that\u2019s not the only thing wrong with it", "That\u2019s crazy. We are living in the twilight zone if all these people are pissed about you bringing up the fact mold is inside of drinks haha.\n\nAre you sure it\u2019s mold and not settled sentiment from those type of drinks?\n\nI would document things and not do anything with the drinks. Let a customer who is disgusted enough to call them out and call a health department about it. Or just complain on social media or google and word get out. Is this a private owned ice cream shop or a franchised commercial one?", "OP, you are in the food service industry. Does your shop not have inspections? Do you think that customers would willingly take moldy drinks and not complain? \n\nObvious mold in the drinks means that something is seriously wrong. Take your pictures if you want but please call the Health Department so they can do a more through investigation. If you time it right,  it will seem like the customer called instead of you.\n\nAnd please look for another job. Any food service place that is this unconcerned about safety violations is not a place to be working at.", "no it was 100% mold in the flavor that he ordered there is no settled stuff inside of it.", "it\u2019s a rita\u2019s so it\u2019s a big chain i just reported the news to our local food and health department", "Damn that sucks I love Rita\u2019s lol. Now I am scared to go back again.. the pistachio custard is so good", "it\u2019s not the corporations fault it\u2019s my bosses it\u2019s really not that hard to throw stuff away when it\u2019s past it\u2019s expiration date id still eat there just not from the location i work at", "It's a franchise so it's all going to come down to the individual owners. Frankly, this sounds like a bad one.", "I\u2019ve heard things about them. A woman I went to HS with dated someone who had like 8 franchises.. no longer does but heard stuff from her a handful of years ago and it was disappointing", "Having been in the franchise food service trenches I can almost guarantee that M got reamed by the owner over the phone for failing to rotate product when it was her job (best case) or for the fact that they'd have to take a loss on throwing away the expired and moldy product \"because [OP] is making a big deal about it\" (most likely). She took it out on you because she's used to everyone being so demoralized by the constant rule breaking and grossness that they don't rock the boat. \n\nYou did the right thing, and I'm proud of you for reporting. Food health and safety rules aren't arbitrary and violating them is one of the situations where reporting is the right thing to do. With that said, it's time to start looking for a different place to work, because even if they correct the violations, no government body can make them clean up the toxic attitudes that led to the broken regulations in the first place. And you deserve better than letting this place grind you down into an M by the time you're 25.", "NEVER buy those slushie drinks...I have worked in 3 different chain stores that have those self-serve stations and I can attest that those dispenser jets have NEVER been take apart and cleaned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, by the way", "She was just lazy. Good job. NTA", "You are NTA OP.\n\nYour co worker is.\n\nYour boss could be shut down over this safety violation.", "Sounds like M was supposed to be checking drinks and didn\u2019t and is pissed because she was caught", "NTA - Please report this to the state health inspector!!!!", "NTA.  You may want to talk to a food inspector.  You should **NOT** be selling drinks covered in mold.", "If they retaliate in any way - document it.   For all you \u201cknow\u201d that disgruntled customer reported your store.", "i would take that to the news. when i worked at a local restaurant, i found out from other staff our building had mice & roaches living the walls. i told everyone i was friends with no to patronize our restaurant.\n\nnta", "If the fibreglass is super loose, you\u2019re probably breathing that in which is extremely unsafe as it cannot leave the lungs.", "I'd suggest reporting to corporate as well.  They'll likely make sure it gets fixed immediately, and supervised closely moving forward because one bad franchise like this can hurt their whole brand."]}
