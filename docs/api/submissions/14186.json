The issue is that the school seats parents together by default. I'm willing to go with that if need be, but would prefer not to have to do that. So I asked my son if he would mind asking if the school could have us seperated. \n\nHe got upset, claiming I hate his father more than I love him. I told him that's not true, I was just asking, but he unloaded on me. He said I've always made him feel like shit for not hating his dad, and he's sick of feeling guilty. He pointed out that one of his friends has divorced parents, and they get along great (Not at all the same situation). He ended up uninviting me, and is giving my spot to my mother instead.

We divorced eight years ago after I caught him in the act cheating, which was also the last time I saw him. I left and he didn't see that I was there, and I had my brothers serve him the papers and clear out my stuff. My lawyer handled everything during the court stuff, and unfortunately in my state they don't take infidelity into account for custody, so we split 50/50.\n\nSince then I've used a coparenting app for any needed communication. It records all our converstaions via text so they can be saved. I've never had to so much as look at my ex since, we agreed to just drop our son off outside our houses and stay inside during this. I haven't tried to stop my son from having a relationship with his father, I just prefer not to hear about it from him (Though I don't outright ban the subject or anything like that)\n\nAnyway my sons graduation is coming up, and of course he wants both of us there. The issue is that the school seats parents together by default. I'm willing to go with that if need be, but would prefer not to have to do that. So I asked my son if he would mind asking if the school could have us seperated. \n\nHe got upset, claiming I hate his father more than I love him. I told him that's not true, I was just asking, but he unloaded on me. He said I've always made him feel like shit for not hating his dad, and he's sick of feeling guilty. He pointed out that one of his friends has divorced parents, and they get along great (Not at all the same situation). He ended up uninviting me, and is giving my spot to my mother instead.

Couldn't be bothered.\n\nWow.

My aunt and uncle were close to this extreme, they had three children together, and they\u2019d both attend an event like graduation but never anything inside/socializing together (like a dinner after).  My cousins commented that it was the first time they\u2019d seen their parents in the same room together in 20 years when they boarded the plane to go identify the body of the youngest. You are wasting your life and important experiences with your son by putting how much you hate his father first.", "You basically trained your son for a decade to have only one of you at any important event for him. \n\nI guess he hoped that for once he could try to have both of you and not feel in the middle of your problems. \n\nYou showed him he can't have that, and he decided that since you did it, his dad was the one to get the spot. \n\nYou have until the next big event to prove you can do what you failed to do this time, or you are up for a long list of \"no I didn't send you an invit, dad will be there so I didn't bother\".", "I'm just imaging your poor child at like age 11 standing all alone outside your houses in the cold waiting for the other parent to come get him. Or being dropped off with the adult equivalent of a bratty teen insisting her lame parent drop her off a block away from school and shooing them away quickly so no one associates her with lame old dad.

A lot of people cheat, yes it\u2019s absolutely terrible and I get it hurts but that\u2019s not a reason to be this extreme. It really does damage the children when you can\u2019t get your shit together and just coparent", "I am speaking from the place of your son because I was there. My mom cheated on my dad, they divorced when I was 10 and for my high school graduation she asked me if she and my stepdad could sit separately. I said no, if they couldn\u2019t set their shit aside for one day to support me then I didn\u2019t want them there.

YTA.", "Right... You're describing exactly what I'm suggesting. This kid has had 0 experiences in 8 years with both parents and based on this story is put in lousy positions because of it, unless you believe this is the only time something like this has happened.\n\nNo one here is suggesting they get back together or have weekly family brunch, but that at least for the big life milestones the kid gets to have both parents present to celebrate.", "I disagree. Cheaters are bad parents by default and should lose custody. Unpopular opinion maybe, but they made the choice to sacrifice their family. Ethical non-monogamy or none.", "No it's not the child's job to accommodate his parents if his mother can't put up with sitting with his father for a few hours she should call the school and not make her child do it for her", "Good question.

I had to attend my youngest\u2019s graduation with my ex and we were literally right next to each other. Like sitting next to someone in a theater. Right there.", "Yeah that\u2019s honestly so heartbreaking. I get that catching your spouse cheating is painful, but it\u2019s not like this guy has been abusive to them. So many couples have someone cheat and they split without all the drama. The poor kid absolutely deserves to still see his parents together every once in a while. Mom absolutely should not be dumping her emotional baggage on a child", "> Did you even try to work out your relationship or did you just... Oh, no, I re-read it. You just ditched. of course.

She said she wants to go regardless, but asked him if he would mind arranging a separate seat.\n\nThe only reason she's not there is because the teen was offended by the request.\n\nOtherwise she would suck it up.\n\nHe never had to choose between them at the graduation. They both would've been present. He just chose to uninvite her instead of declining.", "Cheating is wrong and unhealthy. However, there are always two sides to a story. I, for one, am not entirely convinced what happened between OP and her husband", "This is horrendous advice!", "Except he literally just told you that you have made him feel guilty everyday for the last 8 years . You may not outright have \"banned\" dad talk by him. But you're acting like that's some gracious concession you made. You have clearly made comments to him or how else would he know you \"don't prefer\" to hear about him? You basically forced your son into living a half life with  you where he's so on tenterhooks he can't even bring up his existence outside of your 50% custody.

Your issues with him are between you two and you never should have let those issue effect either of your relationships with your son", "Sounds like he could use someone to talk too about the situation that isnt you or your ex like a therapist.", "I don't see any significant difference between asking your child if you can call vs asking your child if they would mind sorting it- as long as she gives them an opportunity to decline without reprocussions. \n\nBoth options center the child and what they're comfortable with and are a way of opening the conversation to present alternatives.", "She literally just doesn\u2019t want to sit right next to him, having literally avoided the man for 8 years. It\u2019s a graduation. There\u2019s hundreds of people. She can comfortably be involved, not sitting next to her ex.", "So you're putting the responsibility on the kid to believe his mom would do something she's refused to do for 8 years?\n\nHowever someone slices it, the mom should have been the one asking for a different seat.", "Let me guess. You think the kid should get to keep his angelic father figure mental image and never have to understand that there are consequences for bad behavior....\n\nAddon...because it sounds like the kid holds the mom responsible for the divorce and not having dad at home.", "Exactly. Unless a parent is being abusive, they deserve to have a relationship with their child. Yeah cheating sucks, but that\u2019s no reason to damage a relationship with your child and make them feel guilty for just wanting to see their dad", "...as a teenager you would prefer your mother go over your head and call your school to tell the administration about your home life in order to secure herself a separate ticket from the father?\n\nI absolutely would not have preferred that.\n\nIf could have been\n\n1. Hey would  you mind getting me a separate seat?\n\n2. Oh, you would mind. It is a bother. Okay. Can I call the school to arrange it?\n\n3. Oh. No. Alrighty then. It's about the principle of it. Yes, I will sit with your father.", "Son deserves to see his parents act like adults and not have to spend the rest of his life appeasing their precious anger.\nDropping off outside the house? Can\u2019t have any contact?\n\nNot here to excuse cheating but Jesus H OP- your poor kid", "The sins of the father should not be imparted to the child. Ever. Validate a child's feelings but his fathers transgression is not nor ever will be the kids businesses.  A child learns about consequences from their own mistakes not someone else's.", "Clarifying... It would have been more embarrassing to you for \n\n(A) your mom to call the front office and ask for a different seat, compared to\n\n(B)  you have to go to the front office, get a meeting with an administrator, and then explain to them that you've been sent to ask them if your mom could have a different seat because 8 years ago your dad cheated on your mom and now they're divorced and she hasn't been in the same room with him since?", "What anger? She doesnt want contact with the ex which is 100% okay. If she stopped the kid from seeing the ex or said horrible things about the ex, it would be something else, but it seems like the opposite is happening and the ex is bashing the mom. Like I said whenthe kid gets his heart broke by cheating, he will hopefully understand if the mom bothers to explain the reason behind the divorce.", "Since when is she punishing the kid for the cheating ex. It isnt like she gave up custody, abused him, etc....\n\nShe had her heart shattered by the one person that swore to love her forever by watching him stick his dick in somsone else.\n\nShe doesnt want to sit next to the ex and the kid is trying to keep the picture of the perfect family.", "I hate to tell you, but the fathers sin will always ripple out and fk up everyone involved. The father fked his son's emotional health as soon as he *thought* of infidelity.", "...They gave us tickets for graduation seating. If he went to my highschool he could've asked his friends if any of them had an extra ticket and then just given it to her.", "Too many words. \u201cMy parents divorced and hate each other, I need separate seats\u201d", "How? How can you say the ex is bashing mom? Based on what?\nWhy are you so eager for the kid to hurt? If he doesn\u2019t know about the cheating then a 10 year old woke up one day and mom was gone and suddenly there\u2019s a custody arrangement. Kid has had to spend almost half his life navigating two adults who have almost no contact, and now OP wants him to fix the seating for her. That\u2019s her job.", "You're projecting a lot of your own experiences, assumptions, and hypotheticals into this, which kinda isn't the point.\n\nEither the kid is overreacting to this singular event, or the mom is being unreasonable and the kid is tired of navigating her behavior.\n\nA kid doesn't come up with something as deep as \"you hate him more than you love me\" for nothing. And if OP's mom accepted the ticket, either OP's mom and son are assholes, or she is the asshole.", "And hopefully it's as easy as that. But if not, the kid has to negotiate and navigate a dumb conversation.\n\nEither way, the mom should have just picked up the phone and done this.", "No one randomly goes off about \"hate\" without some reason. the mom already admitted to avoid the subject, which probably means the kid doesnt know her side of the story at all. Which means *drum roll* that the kid got this notion from the other side.....and some how I doubt the kid would go off if the ex was speaking nothing but goodness.", "I mean... That's how my brother's college graduation was done too with tickets. It's really common. And there are other options for judgements other than \"NTA and YTA\". I'd assign dad as an asshole just because he cheated 8 years ago and they're still seeing consequences from it.\n\nEveryone is assuming that OP is an unreliable narrator but I think it's just as likely the teenager isn't fully privy to why they divorced, or perhaps he blames the mother for the divorce and the estrangement between the two because from his perspective she's the one withdrawing from the father. Why else would he compare their relationship to a random divorced friend like all divorces are the same? From his perspective, she left his dad- ergo she left him. She hates the dad more than she loves her kid because she willingly left knowing there would be split custody.\n\nAnd while one would hope most coparents are better than this, they don't seem to have a bad co-parenting relationship as she describes. It's just fully business. \nIf she doesn't even like hearing about the father I doubt she's talking shit about him. But again, maybe there's something she's not telling us. But like you said - that's speculation and not really a part of the judgement.", "I mean, refusing to even look at your ex and never attending a single event in your kid\u2019s life if there\u2019s even a chance you could encounter the ex, and making your kid ask the school to rearrange seating just so you don\u2019t have to be anywhere near your kid\u2019s other parent is a pretty compelling case for \u201chate.\u201d Far more compelling than making up that Dad has been telling tales.\n\nBut whatever. You want to make the ex even more of a villain and let OP be some sainted martyr who never did anything wrong ever."]}
