And whatever is discussed, it should not discussed in front of the child.  What goes on in between the father & mother in regards to their daughter is between them. And I think the other thing for OP to remember is that since she is the stepmother the child will (even if it's the furthest thing from the truth) make the step parent(s) out to be the villain.
