Family trip costs stay in the family that is going. If the child wants souvenirs then the other parent can send dollars but you should not ask for money for the other parent to get them. \n\nYou decided to go to Disney World  and it is okay if the kids had to do some chores to earn money to understand how dollars work. \n\nOn the ESH- the other parent should have consulted you. Full stop, that is good coparenting. My question to you is can you afford it? If so, would you be denying an opportunity based on your previous frustration about vacation dollars?", "If you can easily afford the $1300 then please pay it. My guess is that mom signed her up for the trip hoping you would pay but knowing that even if you didn't, she would figure out how to make it work to give her daughter the opportunity.

You don't get to ask for money for a trip that you are doing of your own volition and is a vacation.\n\nBut as this is an educational trip, I would be paying for half of the child's costs.  I'm guessing that not every kid is having a chaperone so find out what the cost is for just the child going and pay half of that.  So just ring the school.\n\nIf everyone needs a chaperone then pay 1/4 of it.  So remove the half for the second person and pay 1/2 of what's left.  So that could be $650.  Work out what's cheaper and pay the lesser amount as it's >$200.  This is less of a vacation.   Don't punish the child because the mother is pushing the boundaries.  \n\nAsk the school for details of everything if you like... because you or your husband might prefer to accompany the child.  Did you have that option... maybe you all can tag along too?  It's the chaperone issue that is a bit more of an issue than the cost of a school trip.  Your husband wasn't offered the opportunity to be the chaperone and his ex made the decision to be it.\n\nThe trip in 2019 wasn't ideal simply because your husband's parents are also your stepdaughter's grandparents.  So was there another reason why you didn't take her?  Was it that she was with her mother during the time you went... and if she was, would her mother allowed her to go.  If the answer is no, then the mother has no grounds for complaining but if the answer is yes, then perhaps you could've taken her.

That sounds like alot, but i don\u2019t travel much so what do i know. \n\nWhat DO know is $5400 is a big commitment to make before getting the other person to agree to half. \n\nNTA Because said birth mom made assumptions she shouldn\u2019t have.
