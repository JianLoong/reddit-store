We decided to throw a party to celebrate his birthday and also our new home. I was in charge of cooking and baking any food for the party, so I made my boyfriend a pretty huge chantilly cake since it\u2019s his favorite and also his moms- who I\u2019ve been trying to get in favor of lately. Since I knew the original cake wasn\u2019t going to be safe for my boyfriends brother to eat (he\u2019s allergic to dairy and can\u2019t eat strawberries) I decided to test out a new recipe I learned in my baking class. It was just a small chocolate cake but I didn\u2019t want him to feel left out and we had other guests attending who might also be dairy free for all I know. \n\n I thought I was being thoughtful but the night of the party my boyfriend\u2019s mom kept giving me the stank eye and whenever the party calmed down she pulled me aside and told me I was whore for trying to \u201cseduce\u201d her son. At first I thought she meant my boyfriend but no she was insinuating me making an extra cake for my boyfriend\u2019s brother, was me trying to flirt. Now obviously that\u2019s not the case, for one he just turned 19 and that\u2019s weird\u2026 but also I\u2019m very much so in love with my boyfriend and would never do something like that- especially not with his brother. Even after explaining to her why she still kept calling me names.\n\n My boyfriend took my side and said there was nothing wrong with what I did but it\u2019s been a couple of days and it seems like he\u2019s starting to believe his moms words. I didn\u2019t make the cake for any other reason other than being kind, since I understand how it feels to be left out during parties when it comes to treats. But with her reaction, I\u2019m starting to feel like I may have over stepped.", "created_utc": 1694058893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c5mky/aita_for_making_my_boyfriends_brother_a_separate/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she called you a whore over this is a pretty good indication that she's the nutty one here.

That was an  incredibly thoughtful thing you did to go out of your way for 1 person. \n\nYour BFs mom is a psychopath. If your man actually believes her then you\u2019ll be on a rough road for the rest of this relationship. \n\nIt would also mean he had no acknowledgment of how thoughtful it was for you to consider someone else\u2019s condition and do twice the amount of work to make someone feel included. Which to me is the bigger red flag.", "NTA. You were considerate and a good host. Your boyfriends mom is an AH, and if your bf believes that BS so is he.", "NTA. Huh?? By that logic, my mom (f40) was flirting with my cousin (m10) every time she made him a custom cupcake using soda at family events because he was allergic to everything under the sun (eggs, dairy, tree nut, peanuts, and many more). Making custom food for dietary restrictions \u2260 flirting, and anybody who says it does is the one with the problem.", "NTA. But if your bf is giving water to his mom\u2019s seeds (entertaining her nonsense)\u2026now would be the time to run from that relationship", "NTA you were being very considerate towards someone with allergies so that they could have cake on their birthday. Mom has major issues if she thinks it\u2019s anything more.  If boyfriend starts believing mom that\u2019s a huge red flag.  Who wants to marry into a family where nice gestures get twisted and misinterpreted constantly.", "NTA! Talk to your boyfriend, this is a big red flag.", "NTA you were being considerate of your future in-laws. Would she like her son (19) to feel left out from not eating the cake, get an allergic reaction or simply have something he can eat? I think she\u2019s been looking for a reason to dislike you and this gave her one. But overall you are being considerate and had good intentions for inclusion.", "NTA what the fuck", "NTA\n\nIt was a very nice thing to have done seeing as people with allergies often miss out.\n\nBut I think you have a bigger problem.  Your BF's mother has some serious issues.  Very serious issues and now your BF is starting to believe her.  \n\nYou don't want to be part of that mess.  Is this the first time your BF has moved in with a GF?  It may be related to his mother and he hasn't cut the apron strings.  There's some issues there that you're going to have to get to the bottom of and decide whether you want to deal with them because it will only get worse if your BF defers to his mommy all the time.", "You sound lovely, please keep away from the crazy.", "So NTA! \n\nThat was really thoughtful of you and fuck anyone that suggests otherwise. \n\nMy kid has an allergy and hates that he never gets to have cake at birthday parties. You probably made the brothers day.", "NTA.  That's a really weird jump for your boyfriend's mom to make.  It's the brother of your boyfriend, its reasonable to think you would also make a cake he can have.  It's also incredibly kind of you to tweak a recipe so he can have the same type of cake as everyone else.", "No, not at all. You're NTA, I think you did something nice and thoughtful, they should appreciate you for it.", "If accommodating someone's dietary restrictions equates to flirting, I've been flirting with my daughter, my MIL, my BIL, MYSELF...\n\nGood grief.
