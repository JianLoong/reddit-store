I am the youngest, because of money problems we moved from our native country to England, where we have stayed for a couple of years. I moved when i was really young (around 2-3 years old i don\u2019t remember) and i am currently around 13-16 years old (keeping age private so family doesn\u2019t know) from this i lost the ability to speak my language fluently and could only understand it, so my mum and my family have been trying to get me to talk in that language and it has been working as i feel like i have improved gradually. Now my mum moved her bf in (25-30m) and he is a nightmare. He is blantantly racist, refuses to accept our food and culture and only wants English food and culture around him. So once my mum was telling my siblings and i off because he said he didn\u2019t feel included around me and my siblings when we were cleaning because we were talking in our language and he was coming in and out of the house so we should talk in english. I got really angry at this because \n\n1. He makes a mess around the house and refuses to help around\n\n2.My mum and himself won\u2019t let him learn how to work machines such as the dishwasher etc.\n\n3. He has no involvement in the conversation so why should we include him if he was just gonna put his crazy beliefs over us.\n\nShe was telling me off in my native language and my sister was in the room and she was defending me and my siblings so then my mum just said \u201ccan you just try to talk in english\u201d and left. she then told us that he kept asking her what she was telling me off for than he deserves to know. I left it at that because i didn\u2019t want an argument.\n\nNot even a couple days later my mum brings all of us into a room and starts saying how her boyfriend is angry that we keep talking in our native language and we have to stop talking in it indefinitely. I got super upset and asked her how am i supposed to learn how to talk it if i can\u2019t even use it. (i\u2019m also learning it for my dad because he lives in my native country and doesn\u2019t know much english) she just said to practice when i go back to the country so it\u2019s easier for everyone.\n\nI didn\u2019t and instead started practicing every more with my siblings and with him around. This resulted in my mum calling me rude for not trying to make her bf feel more included and now i\u2019m stuck inbetween her argument with him. AITA? \n\nEdit i changed the ages and years because i don\u2019t want to get caught so it\u2019s all estimates.", "created_utc": 1677162103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119yvtg/aita_for_talking_in_a_different_language_around/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry, but your mum is TA here, as is the guy obviously. \n\nThat being said, you've mentioned financial issues and moving to England: this bloke must be giving your mum something she wants/needs.

Your mum is probably just desperate for some sort of companionship and is willing to look past how much of an ass this guy is.\n\nYou're in a no win situation I'm afraid and until your mum wises up and kicks this moron to the curb all you can do is calmly explain that you are stuck between a rock and a hard place and that isn't fair on you.", "NTA\n\nYour mum is being ridiculous!

It makes them feel left out, or worse yet, blatantly discussed. In general, you should avoid this to be polite if you can help it. \n\nHowever, you\u2019re in your own home and you\u2019re trying to learn so you can communicate with your father. In this case, your mother is prioritizing her boyfriend over you. That\u2019s not okay. The guy knew he was getting involved with a non-native family. He should have some expectations that another language will be used sometimes. \n\nBut friend, doubling down is vindictive. In life it\u2019s always best to keep your side of the street clean so when conflict comes up, you always know you didn\u2019t start it or make it worse. That way, you don\u2019t lose ground in an argument. \n\nSide note: your mom being involved with a young racist grosses me out.", "You lost me at \u201cbf (25)\u201d.

As long as you aren\u2019t in any danger,\nI would continue to speak in your native language. Screw that guy. And the petty AH in me would be contacting extended family to let them know what\u2019s happening. Something tells me they will give her an earful", "NTA.  Is your mom that hard up for a piece of ass that she is dating a racist?  I couldn't imagine putting up with a racist just to get laid.", "Question is why is she want that bf?   Is she that desperate to make such large sacrifices?", "NTA. I have small level of my native language, just about able to understand what people say and only able to converse in common conversation say. In spite of this, I am so very proud of the little bit of my native language I do know, it makes me feel more connected to where I come from. Additionally to patriotic reasons you also need this language to converse correctly with your father. Literal wars have been fought over people not being allowed to speak their native language. Do not give in, speak it loud & proud!!", "NTA\n\nWhy your mother feels she needs a male around that so obviously doesn't like much of anything about her is an entire thread in itself. \n\nI have definite opinions about this subject. You should be able to be yourself at home. Eat the food you want to eat. Not have to clean up after a lazy addition who brings what to the table? On the other hand, you're a minor, stuck where you are for the moment, and I want you to be safe. There are so many red flags with this man your mother has brought home.\n\nHave you all spoken to your mother about this man? I would suggest that as a next move.

As long as you are living with her, you have an obligation to obey her rules as long as they aren't entirely unreasonable. \n\nYou mentioned that the conversations you are having in your native language have nothing to do with him, but he has no way of knowing that. For all he knows, you are talking about him behind his back.\n\nIt sucks that you won't be able to practice your language much anymore . Maybe you can still do it when he isn't around or in places where he isn't such as in your bedroom or outside of your home.\n\nSo unfortunately, you'll just have to put up with it until you are able to move out.", "he\u2019s been here for a couple years as he runs back and my mum chases him back too.", "And they are on off for a couple of years.", "legit even with the best devil d!ck, there are certain horrible behaviours that you can't overlook. and I bet the D isn't even that good.", "i am not going to lie we do talk about him because he verbally abuses us and breaks things in our house, such as doors. i have anxiety and so i start crying when he does this and so we have to speak in the native language so he doesn\u2019t explode again. he hasn\u2019t hit us once but he punches doors and gets loud when he\u2019s angry at my mum.", "So he can't speak his native language in his own house?! IF the other guy is so bothered, he can try and learn a bit! What if they are bad mouthing him behind his back? He probably deserves it and he knows!\n\nAmazing that you are ok with the blatant racism of this guy, to the point where you suggest OP to \"put up with it\", wow.", "Oh, so you're one of those \"speak English\" types.", "No. Just no. What an awful take.", "Lol , ok I don't want to comment on that.", "Wow, the situation is even worse than I thought. I assume you've talked to your mom about how horrible he is, yet she refuses to break up with him. Do you know why she is staying with him?", "that\u2019s okay thank you for your input it\u2019s helping me see things clearer. much appreciated", "i think she\u2019s staying with him because she is lonely and has no one here. all of our relatives except our grandma are in my country and so she is a single mother raising children (one of my siblings is in Uni the other is taking a year gap", "Ah, so that's what it is. Well, maybe you can convince her she can do better than him? If possible, maybe try creating a profile on an online dating site? There are tons of single men on these sites who are better than her bf, so maybe after seeing that she'll find a better man?", "okay thank you for the advice much appreciated", "\u201cHe only wants English food and culture\u201d disgusting why would any one want English food and their culture is mid at best NTA"]}
