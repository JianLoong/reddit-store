(He had no idea my son's hair was green, but has made it very well known how he feels about \"unnatural\" hair colors when other members have died their hair pink or blue, etc.) If it had been the big family Christmas party or something, my son would have kept his green hair and taken his great-grandpa's comments in stride--we may have even pointed out to him it was festive for the holidays! \n\nBut under the circumstances, we didn't want to give a 90yo man a heart attack right after he'd just lost his beloved wife.\n\nMy other son has long hair, and chose to tie it back for the funeral even though he hates tying it back, because he figured if his little brother could sacrafice his green hair for his great-grandpa's comfort he could wear his back for a few hours for his great-grandpa's sake as well. \n\nAs for the rest of the family, my MIL might have said something had they come with their \"unorthodoxed\" hair, but I doubt anyone else would have cared one way or the other if they had. And had it been someone else's funeral, my sons probably wouldn't have changed their hair at all and ignored any comments their great-grandpa might have said at a funeral where he wasn't as devastated as his own wife's.\n\nI guess I'm saying if there's someone close to the deceased who'd be *extremely* bothered by it and genuinely consider you disrespectful, it would be nice thing to do--but it still wouldn't make you an AH if you chose not to do it. And if not, then the busibodies can't just suck it up, it's not their head or hair, therefore not their business.\n\nIf there IS someone who would be genuinely upset, might I suggest a ponytail as a compromise? Not a man-bun, but not completely free flowing, either.", "You don\u2019t have to put your hair in a bun if you don\u2019t want to. You could pull it back, smooth it down, and use a hair tie.

You could even tuck your hair into the back of your collar and people couldn\u2019t even tell how long it is.\n\nThat being said, you are an adult, and you can style your hair any way you want.

What an odd thing for them to worry about. Do they think some very religious family member will freak out upon seeing you or something? And why indiscriminate they default to man-bun if you never wear your hair that way? Do you wear regularly wear ponytails or otherwise pull your hair back and they\u2019re mad that you won\u2019t for this?\n\nIdk, I\u2019d probably insist on specific hairstyles for them if they want to try that with you.

But its just a ponytail, manbun or whatever. Just wear not its not the end of the world. Maybe all the years of the family crotiquing my hair has made me insensible to the opinions about it and didnt even think to ask. \n\nThe problem is that society (or the social circle mu family is part of) doesnt see men with long hair as the normal.

I don't know how close you were with your uncle, but someone attending the funeral must have been. Something as minor as this could really upset a grieving spouse/sibling/parent.\n\nIf it were another occasion (like Easter Sunday at a church) then not as much of an issue, imho.

If you not only notice other people\u2019s hair at your spouse\u2019s funeral, but also get actually upset by how they\u2019ve styled it (let\u2019s say, outside of an \u201cextreme\u201d like very dirty hair or a slur shaved into the hair) you\u2019re pretty much making the choice to be upset.", "Hahahahaha", "well, ask your parents for the specifics and review it with them.", "I mean, sounds like you take better care of your hair than I do!", "What about a low ponytail? It\u2019s not a man bun and still neat, tied up and non Jesus looking", "Agreed. But does all of this need to come out at a funeral ffs?
