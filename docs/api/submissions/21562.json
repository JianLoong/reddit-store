Octavian and Tiberius were the Roman emperors during his time, for example, so we have a VERY good idea of what they looked like.  Both had short hair.  I use them as benchmarks because the Roman influence included Israel.  In fact, the two large cities in Galilee at the time were Nazareth and *Tiberias* and, of course, the region was ruled by the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate.  Frescoes from the time also depict common men as having short hair.
