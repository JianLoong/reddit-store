End of.\n\nHow does you working and being busy, thereforce unable to watch the dog, mena you don't love him. Good ole mom guilt.", "NTA - this is what dog daycares are for or other friends and family. You cannot force someone to watch your dog when they dont have the availability.", "NTA you are not a dog sitter, there are plenty of people that will look after dogs if she doesnt want to put them in kennels.\n\nIm very overprotective of my little poodle so we spent a while meeting different people until we found someone we were really happy leaving her with.\n\nYour mum needs to do the same.

For a while I took care for a dog because I had more time to do so. But it was considered family's dog", "Perhaps ive misunderstood, I thought this was the moms dog, not OPs", "So it was never your dog - it was a dog your  parents adopted and has nothing directly to do with you?  Yeah, you don't have to pet sit.", "It appears it was your dog for 2 years & then you moved. You\u2019re probably no longer responsible for the cost of the dog so seems like the least you could do is help Mom find a suitable solution for care.\n\neta \u2014 do you have any trusted friends or other family that could step in? I\u2019m going to flip this around & ask if the dog was still with you would you pay for care or ask Mom to watch the dog? I get that she is trying to manipulate you (not fair) but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s doing her best to avoid paying. That makes sense.", "If its the family dog, I think offering 3 of your holidays sounds fair. If you can afford it maybe you can offer money for a kennel.", "It is moms dog. And brothers dog also. Two out of the 3 who adopted the dog. The dog resides with them so that makes the dog THEIR responsibility. They agreed as well that dog should stay with them and not move with OP.", "How did you get that? The dog was OP\u2019s dog for 2 years then dog was left with Mom when they moved.", "If I could I would have taken the dog with me and my fiance. and as we don't travel much or for long periods if they can't take the dog I would pay for a sitter or take for place that can keep the dog, for me it is part of the travel expenses.", "It also belongs to mom and brother who TOGETHER with OP adopted the dog.", "Not exactly, I was living with my mom I this two years she just didn't help me with him during this time... He was always with the three of us(me, my brother and my mom) until I left home last year", "The dog was left with the OTHER two owners. OP was NEVER the sole owner.", "Talk to your Mom. Everyone can do what they want to do & still make sure the dog is cared for.", "It\u2019s about the dog.... not the people. It was your dog essentially. In a house full of people .... Dogs know who their people are.", "No one cares about the people in this story.... it\u2019s really just about what the dog needs.", "I have talked to her twice, she can't take that. She says a week that is it. The problem is me and fiance don't have license for a car so we can't take the dog to other people or sitters and it is a medium - big dog.", "It is about the people! THREE, repeat THREE people adopted the dog together. OP was the care taker because the other two were too lazy. Just like they\u2019re being lazy about finding doggie care while they run around on a vacation. Vacations come AFTER you get your affairs in order (like child care, pet care, mail pick up\u2026)", "I can't figure out if this was her dog she decided not to take with her when she moved or mom's dog who mom didn't care for so OP stepped in....  I give up.", "The goal is dog care.... not what Mom thinks. Go online look for care in the area. Are there pet hotels, in home dog sitters, maybe a neighbor? Your brother lives there he can help you. Leave Mom out & just solve the problem.", "Stop looking at the problem & start looking for a solution. It\u2019s the best you can do. If she chooses not to accept your help then she can stay home", "I don\u2019t own or even know this dog & still want the best care for it", "There\u2019s no assholes here.... Dog care is never an easy decision.", "The brother goes with her on the vacation. I have found a place for him with a trainer for his anxiety, and pretty close. She doesn't want him there for two weeks.", "Ugh.... that\u2019s what I asked originally. So the dog has anxiety.... with what? Separation, strangers, other dogs? If the dog can only be managed in home with certain people then right now is the time to introduce that dog to a new care giver. \n\nYour solution sounds like it will work .... however 2 weeks in an unfamiliar place for a dog with anxiety.... call the vet & get some meds. The trainer will thank you.\n\neta \u2014 brother is there ... with the dog... in the home. He can help solve this problem", "Sorry misunderstood your question, he have separation anxiety, he is okay when he is home, it doesn't matter with whom he stays."]}
