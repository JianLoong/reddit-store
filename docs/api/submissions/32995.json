And entitled.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nOP, do not hesitate to reach out to the school guidance counselor, your town\u2019s mayor\u2019s office, or a local church. They likely have an arrangement with local businesses to help your family have a nice holiday. Are they going to gift your child with an iPhone or an expensive gaming system? No... but they\u2019ll make sure he has age-appropriate toys or games, books, or clothing. PLEASE DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP. \n\nAnd while I know you have a good mama heart, your boyfriend\u2019s grands are not your concern right now. Your boyfriend can buy them something and as a kindness to yiu, he can include your name on the tag.", "NTA - Dude has a lot of nerve demanding presents for his grandkids that compete *WITH YOUR SON*. Especially when he isn't contributing.\n\nDo not fall for his nonsense about fairness - you getting your son a gift equates to his grandson's mom getting them a gift. He isn't a dad, those are not your kids, money is hella tight for everyone. They can have something SMALL or an experience (take them to a movie one matinee or something) or he can find side work and pay for them to have something on his own. This is NOT your bill to foot.\n\nSeriously, shame on him for even pulling this with you \\*smh\\*", "NTA. I get it that your bf is unemployed. It is still a bit rich that he would expect you to buy presents for his grandkids. Surely he can do that himself!", "NTA. You are supporting this boyfriend. *You are not spending any money on your own young child*. I don\u2019t see how not having money for his grandkids is showing favoritism, or at least, why it\u2019s inappropriate. You have a greater obligation to your minor child than either of you has to a grandchild. The first is closer to a duty. The second is closer to a want.\n\nLet me suggest some alternatives. One is to tell the grandkids that you will be having a special grandkids Christmas next year. Or perhaps the two of you can do something for the kids and grandkids that isn\u2019t expensive, like making cookies with them. Or boyfriend can find something to give them of his. Doesn\u2019t he have anything cool like a pocket knife for his 12yo? Can you find something like a cute scarf for the 4yo to dress up in?", "You're NTA.

That\u2019s hardly an extravagant gift. John isn\u2019t working perhaps he can make something for the grandkids, bake a gingerbread house? We don\u2019t spend a lot on gifts, it feels inauthentic and hollow to give a gift you know you can\u2019t afford. There are plenty of ways to celebrate Christmas without getting in debt. Baking, crafting, a winter walk. A homemade meal or homemade vouchers for that can be used throughout the year for play dates, movie nights etc.", "NTA\n\nJust tell your boyfriend you can gift them his phone and his laptop. Then its fair, everyone gets second hand electronics, but since they are HIS grandkids they oc get his electronics, your son gets yours.  :)\n\nAlso, if he always was a good parent/grandpa to his son /daughter and to their kids, i'm sure the parents will be more than willing to help him out by buying their kids extragifts and label it \"from grandpa\".", "INFO\u2014 will all 3 kids be opening their gifts in front of each other?
