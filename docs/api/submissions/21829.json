My guess is Suzie messed up and you hadn't actually made the cut. I think there was empty space (someone else dropping out, perhaps) which is why you got a last minute invite. It's not your fault you're unable to attend at such short notice. \n\nAs for the Hen party, if you'd made it clear that you were only attending the drinks part then no, they don't get to charge you after the fact.", "Nope NTA\n\nSuzie messed up by inviting someone who wasn't invited to the wedding to attend the hen night.\n\nSuzie also knew you would not be attending the extra activities after the drinks as you made that clear that you couldn't afford it so there's no reason for her to expect you to contribute financially towards it. \n\nHer attempt to get money from you makes me wonder how many others she invited just to subsidise the event.\n\nKelly clearly didn't invite you, and sending a vague hinted invitation a couple of days ahead of the wedding mates that very clear. To expect a gift after that behaviour is beyond rude.\n\nThey are both incredibly rude and entitled individuals. You owe neither of them anything at all and I think it's time to cross Kelly's name off your mental list of friends.\n\nNot all friendships endure throughout ones life, some are more temporary in nature than others.", "If I understand it correctly, you never received a formal rsvp, only a message on FB with scarce, incomplete information. That's not how an invitation works. They didn't want you to be there, but wanted the wedding gift.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA\nShe sent the invitation to you last minute because he knew for sure you couldn't make it and was expecting you to send her the gift anyway as you couldn't attend. Those were not friends, they were only looking for money and gifts.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nWas the hen night the right time to pin someone down about an invite? No. But it was understandable that you would be confused as to why you were there at all if you and Kelly hadn't been close for a while.", "NTA. You were never a guest for the wedding, you were a gift grab/financer of the hen party.", "NTA.
