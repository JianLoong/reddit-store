You\u2019re uninterested in participating in what seems to be a family activity. \n\nIs this political? Is it because of the effort you\u2019re expected to put in? Is this relayed to your mental wellness?", "NTA \u2014 You might look into why you feel this way.  If the problem is the turkey, would buying it cooked help? (Local grocery store delis offer cooked turkeys and anything else you may want.)  \n\nIf the problem is how you are feeling about your family, or your role in it, maybe this is something to talk about with your husband and/or a counselor?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with skipping the holiday, but you probably want to explore your feelings and options more.\n\nI don\u2019t think your daughter will hate you.\n\nSo you want to know what it is about this holiday you once liked that makes it too hard for you right now.", "Are you just not up for the production of Thanksgiving dinner?  It is a pretty labor intensive meal, especially if you're doing it all alone.  \n\nWhy not have your husband cook, that could be your new tradition.  That or those grocery store ready made dinners don't look too bad.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You can decide you don\u2019t want to celebrate the holiday.  As long as you don\u2019t stop your husband and child from doing it.", "NTA but please talk to a medical professional about how you feel. I am some random Reddit stranger so not one to judge, but by the way you write, you sound like your dealing with depression especially if this was something you used to like to do.\n\nNTA for how your feeling (feelings are biochemical reactions in your body that you have no control over).  You can control your reactions to those feelings.  If you skip Thanksgiving without looking into why you feel this way, you are doing yourself, your husband and your daughter a disservice.\n\nPlease seek help for this and here\u2019s hoping you feel better.", "I keep asking if we can just go out to eat because I'm tired of cooking every year. My husband insists on having a meal at home.\n\nWe used to get one of these precooked deals from the grocery store, but they changed brands and now it's awful. So now I'm back to cooking everything from scratch. And I'm just tired. I'm tired of holidays and the preparation and the expense and the endless cooking and the leftovers nobody eats, so they just go to waste.\n\nI just don't want to do it anymore. I just want to go out somewhere, have someone else cook and someone else clean up, and come home to clean kitchen and a frig that isn't stuffed full of crap nobody will eat.\n\nI'm with you. NTA", "The last few years I have bought Chinese food for thanksgiving. The kids actually seemed to enjoy it. Then we spend the day watching movies. No stress, easy clean up.", "NTA for your feeling, but I'm not sure who the TA is. Who is approaching you with such judging and uncaring way?\n\nAlso, how did your husband share this info with his mom. Was he just explaining that you wanted to skip Thanksgiving this, or was he complaining to her about it?\n\nYou don't seem to know why your feelings are different this year. It could be something temporary (maybe you are pregnant again; maybe something else is going on medically, or there's been a fundamental emotional or mental shift that may need long-term attention; maybe this year has just been a tough year...) Maybe it's the transition into and out of global crisis mode that has taken place the last few years. I think you will really benefit from curiosity about where your feeling is coming from. I think it's something you owe yourself first and also owe your husband and child so that your family is prepared to deal with this shift.\n\nYour husband should be as curious and be ready to help you seek support and address whatever is going on. He should also be supportive and understanding that, for whatever reason, you are not in that space right now. Is he doing those things, or is he the one judging you and guilting you? How you two are communicating and supporting one another is far more important than whether you eat turkey on the 4th Thursday of November.", "NTA\n\nThanksgiving is stressful especially if you're the one doing the cooking and getting everything ready. I personally feel like it shouldn't matter if you have a big feast/what you eat. They've taught us since we were kids that Thanksgiving is about expressing what you're grateful for, so why does it matter that we have a big turkey dinner? Once my family started doing small gatherings we all collectively agreed that we weren't even a fan of traditional Thanksgiving food. So we just decide what we want to eat for the year and just have a good meal with each other and it alleviated all the stress. Last year we just ordered pizzas and it was honestly the most memorable thanksgiving in years. Holidays are about being with family, and having a good time and if \"tradition\" is getting in the way of that, why not change it?"]}
