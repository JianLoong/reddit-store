You\u2019re uninterested in participating in what seems to be a family activity. \n\nIs this political? Is it because of the effort you\u2019re expected to put in? Is this relayed to your mental wellness?", "NTA \u2014 You might look into why you feel this way.  If the problem is the turkey, would buying it cooked help? (Local grocery store delis offer cooked turkeys and anything else you may want.)  \n\nIf the problem is how you are feeling about your family, or your role in it, maybe this is something to talk about with your husband and/or a counselor?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with skipping the holiday, but you probably want to explore your feelings and options more.\n\nI don\u2019t think your daughter will hate you.\n\nSo you want to know what it is about this holiday you once liked that makes it too hard for you right now.", "Are you just not up for the production of Thanksgiving dinner?  It is a pretty labor intensive meal, especially if you're doing it all alone.  \n\nWhy not have your husband cook, that could be your new tradition.  That or those grocery store ready made dinners don't look too bad.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You can decide you don\u2019t want to celebrate the holiday.  As long as you don\u2019t stop your husband and child from doing it."]}
