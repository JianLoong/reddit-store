Your mom doesn\u2019t stop thinking about you to take care of your sister, and she doesn\u2019t stop thinking about your sister to take care of you.  Did your sister do a foolish thing to get engaged so quickly? Probably. Is it an AH move to announce her wedding in the middle of the plans for yours? Yes. Is it absurd that your wedding is the backdrop for meeting her boyfriend? Absolutely. But does it diminish your wedding? No, of course not. Your wedding is about you and your husband declaring your intentions to live together and start your family. Nothing your sister can do or say takes away from the beauty of your day, unless you allow it to.

YTA dang those attention stealing little sister-lizards!!", "YTA", "    I honestly see where you are coming from.  Especially with her fianc\u00e9 meeting everyone at your wedding! You have spent a long time planning a wedding, and you are worried you are going to be abandoned. All eyes are on her right now, and that is making you nervous for how your wedding is going to go. \nHowever, I think that there isn\u2019t much to do here.  I don\u2019t know that voicing these concerns are going to be very productive.  I think making a fuss about how she\u2019s swooping in is only going to make your wedding and all the planning even worse.  Its going to polarize people and drive everyone apart during what is already going to be a stressful time.  I\u2019m sorry you are having to deal with this.\nThe other commenters are right that you should be worried about her.  You probably are, and its getting lost in all the commotion.  I am sure you and your family have already tried talking to her about how rushed it is, but if not, definitely do it.  The likelihood that their marriage will go bad and possibly even turn abusive is kind of high.  Honestly, everything you\u2019ve mentioned so far about their relationship and how the engagement is going, looks like a disaster waiting to happen. Focus on yourself and your fianc\u00e9 right now.  Everything will be ok.", "YTA she can have her wedding when she damn well pleases", "YTA. You\u2019re absolutely upset at the wrong thing here. Why are you not worried about your sister marrying someone she barely knows? Jfc this is much bigger than your wedding.", "Didn't have to read past the title. YTA YTA YTA, for being so afraid of possibly missing out of any attention. Grow up.", "NTA and this is going to horribly blow up in sister's face. Just Grey rock and keep it out of sight out of mind. With a sister like this, how good of a relationship do you really have?", "She\u2019s not worried about her sister marrying someone she\u2019s only known for a couple months because OP also got engaged after a couple months \ud83d\ude02 \u201cdating for over a year\u201d \u201cplanning my wedding for 6 months\u201d \u201cwe knew we were going to get married before we even got engaged\u201d", "Bit of a devil's advocate scenario here, because on the face of it, I agree.\nBut then I did the emotional math, so to speak, of this situation.\n\nImagine hearing your 18yo sister is getting married to her 22yo boyfriend that you've never met. You know she has a history of emulating you and rushing into milestones you just achieved.\nIn this scenario, you'd be worried sick about your sister, right? Scared that she's making the wrong choice and that she's rushing headlong into a car crash of a marriage, or worse, that he has some sort of hold over her. Your parents are even more worried, and unable to focus on anything happy because they don't know what to do about your sister.\n\nNow imagine that in the middle of all this worry is _your wedding_.\nYou were hoping for everyone to be excited, but instead, they can only worry. They have to make a 2nd set of wedding plans that they don't want to make at all because they have no idea who this dude is and it's just plain scary tbh.\n\nIn essence, your sister is making you and your parents feel worry during a time in your life when you should be feeling happy anticipation.\n\nWouldn't you be pissed?", "Bride-lizards oh my god that\u2019s awesome ! I will use that from now on haha too good not to !", "OP isn't even much better timeline wise, she started planning a wedding 6 months into a relationship. They all sound like children.", "My biggest question here is why are those kids getting married after barely meeting eachother", "Perfectly said. People are only looking at \"taking attention from my wedding part\" but ignoring the reason why this attention is being diverted. Of course OP doesn't want her family all stressed out at her wedding."]}
