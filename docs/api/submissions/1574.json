You aren't using it as soap or a towel?\n\nNTA. Your bf need to learn about personal autonomy. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't like it if you told him how to shower, or eat, or...", "NTA. Your boyfriend seems to be looking for something to complain about.", "NTA\n\nI suppose if you shower daily and eat a lollipop every time it\u2019s a decent amount of sugar but like, come on dude. People do way, way worse things. The lollipop habit is odd but nothing more. He needs to relax.", "NTA. \nYou\u2019ve found a way to manage your time and have fun while doing it\u2026it\u2019s not like you\u2019re leaving lollipop sticks all over the place. I understand why you would get angry at him. Very much not his problem. And very much not A problem. Enjoy your lollipops \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA. Tell him to prove it\u2019s unhygienic/bad for health.

About lollipop consumption *while in the shower.* \n\nIf he can\u2019t produce anything, then tell him to stop commenting.", "NTA- How does the lollipop affect him in any way? Do you leave the sticks in the shower? If not, he needs to get over himself.", "I think that either he is very controlling, or he is tired of the relationship and can't communicate his frustrations,  so he is fixating on the lollipop.\nThere is just no way for someone to be this bothered over a lollipop for no reason.\nYou are of course NTA but I think your relationship is in trouble.", "NTA and I have the same attention issues so I'm going to start shower lollipops too, thanks for the idea! Also, he sounds boring.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird but doesn\u2019t affect him in any conceivable way whatsoever", "It isn\u2019t unhygienic, and that\u2019s a clever way of helping yourself with the shower troubles. He is unreasonable, controlling, and just yellow/orange flags.", "nta, you're correct that it isn't his problem", "NTA, there are bigger problems in the world than eating a fucking lolipop while showering, as long as you're not having a full blown buffet in there he can shut it", "Unless you\u2019re using some massive lollipop, I don\u2019t get the problem. Sure it\u2019s odd but it\u2019s a harmless odd.", "lmao your boyfriend would really hate /r/showerbeer and /r/showerorange! \n\nThe only potential problem with this is if the lollipop made the shower sticky and you left it that way, but it sounds like that's not happening. This is a very bizarre thing for your bf to be upset about. You're doing it in private, it's not affecting him, and it's obviously not unhealthy or unhygienic (I've noticed that a lot of people use \"health\" or 'hygiene\" as arguments for things when their true issue is something much less defensible). \n\n>He's really upset that I would voice my anger at him\n\nThis is a concerning statement to me. You were defending your own private actions from his unreasonable judgement and he's mad at you for it - but *you're* supposed to quietly take him ranting about your totally fine shower habits? \n\nDoes he normally get unreasonably upset when you do things he perceives as weird or unusual? Or is this just his one bizarre issue? If it's the former...that's a much bigger problem than shower lollipops. But if not...he needs to figure out why he's taking this so personally, and he needs to get over it and stop trying to control a fun and harmless habit. NTA.", "NTA, .. I would be concerned about choking if you slipped  etc, but maybe you have better balance than I do.", "NTA and I think this is a creative solution to the two problems! I see no reason it is unhygienic so long as you properly dispose of the lollipop sticks. Your bf is being an ass an you deserve to be treated better.", "NTA. None of his business. What really concerns me is that he got really upset at you because you voiced your anger at him. He has no control over you\u2026or should have no control", "NTA. Why does this bother him so much? There are way more important things to worry/get upset about. This is just silly and controlling \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA I also hate showers and I'm definitely going to start doing this.\n\n>He's really upset that I would voice my anger at him\n\nBut as you said he'd been voicing *his* dislike of this situation for YEARS! Really concerning that the moment you stand up for yourself he's got an issue with directing anger at each other...", "NTA\n\nThis is a weird habit, but not a harmful one.\nIt seems so petty, why does he even know you have a lollipop in the shower, unless he's watching you shower? And not in the consensual way.\nIt isn't a crime to have weird habits.", "NTA.  This could not be any less of his business.\n\nYou should not let things build up and brew until you go off, though.  Say things when they bother you, if not the first time, then at least the second or third.", "NTA. I don't see or understand how this affects him... its not like you're lighting up a cigarette or something. Sure, you could set a timer, but thats not enjoyable for you. I am not seeing where the unhygienic part comes in... Is this a symptom of something else in your relationship? Because this seems like an odd thing to fight over. Its just strange, not bad.", "Nta your boyfriend is being ridiculous.", "I think it\u2019s adorable. I\u2019d pop one in my mouth and join you for a shower.", "NTA - it literally has 0 effect on him. You do you!", "NTA. Why is he policing what you do in the shower? Ick.", "NTA. \n\nSo he can tell you repeatedly that he doesn't like that you shower with a lollipop and continue to list all the reasons why, but you aren't allowed to tell him back why you disagree? You realize that isn't about you \"expressing your anger\" in a mean way, it means he thinks he can bother you- for years- about changing something that has zero impact on him, but when tell him to fully stop bringing it up, he is upset at you?\n\nListen, you have an unusual shower setup. A lollipop has zero nutritional value, but we all (well most of us) have daily food habits that are wasteful calories- coffee with sugar/cream, an afternoon chocolate snack, dessert, and a lollipop is no different. Plus, it's an established routine for you, and your explanation makes it sound way less odd to me. You figured out something that works for you, and it has zero impact on anyone else. He is bothered just knowing that you are in there with a lollipop, and he needs to get over it. \n\nDon't feel bad for listening to him for years tell you to stop, and finally telling him to get over it. You saying that to him was long overdue!", "nta, you have said you are not going to change, he kept badgering. He was asking for it.", "NTA. If it\u2019s not worth having an argument, though, could you try breaking the lolly part off the stick and just sucking on that in the shower instead? Same result but he won\u2019t be able to see it.", "He would hate /r/ShowerOrange. NTA.", "Life is too short for this to be an issue. So long as you're looking after your teeth, who cares. \n\nAlso has he ever seen a tray of mints or lolly in a nightclub bathroom? This is way more hygienic than tha!", "NTA. \n\nI mean, ngl, I find the concept of a shower lollipop very weird but there's nothing wrong with it? It's not harming you or him? Unless you're like... sticking the finished sticks in his bar of soap or leaving them on the floor for him to stab himself in the foot with them, I truly do not see how this effects him at all or why he cares. \n\nThis is completely harmless and your boyfriend's being really weird about it. Enjoy your shower lollipops!", "NTA\n\nHe continued to push your buttons and you lashed out. We all have a breaking point\n\nHowever, I would be worried about potentially slipping and choking on the lollipop AND wasting water because a lollipop usually lasts quite a lot longer than minimal shower time. And this habit may be difficult to explain to children, if you have any in the future. I would recommend looking into small sucking candies, fun music, a shower alarm etc as a replacement for this ritual.", "I am sure this is harmless situation. I feel something is missing though. I really really wonder how is it possible to hate showering. Its all odd.", "Seems like a recipe for an eventual cavity but putting that aside, life is too short not to eat a lollipop in the shower. It\u2019s not harming anyone, and if you want to do it, it\u2019s fine! Your boyfriend needs to get a life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nor does he have any say in it. \n\nMaybe use this as a reason to take a deep look at his other behaviors and how often he expects your wants/thoughts/beliefs to take a second place to his.

Your lollypop in the shower isn't harmful to you. It's honestly less sugar than most people have in their Starbucks. If he's concerned about you possibly slipping, you can put down some non slip tub stickers. If his major issue is that he thinks it's weird he needs an attitude adjustment. Honestly your habit is a whimsical way to get your brain to stay on task, and as someone with ADHD myself I can 100% see the value in that for you. Plus, bonus of candy! To sum up NTA but your boyfriend kind of sounds like one!", "NTA, this really isn't a problem and it feels like he's being an asshole for going at this so hard and trying to control your behavior. Like it just feels so disrespectful that he would have such a loud firm opinion about this and expect you to jump, when this system works for you\n\nIt really sounds like you two need to actually go to counseling and determine whether or not you two should be in a relationship together. Because if he cannot handle you managing your life in a way that makes your life work, does he fit in? Does he actually respect you? Because him really framing that he's upset with you for expressing that you are angry, says that he thinks he should be allowed to disrespect you and you're not allowed to respond.

I just adore it when someone finds a simple but unconventional hack for their own adulting-related issues. If this works for you - perfect. If you're careful not to end up like a shower-lolliskewer, even better. You can talk to your bf and try to have a deeper conversation about what exactly is bugging him.
