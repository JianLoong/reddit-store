{"id": 31079, "submission_id": "17wcwek", "title": "AITA for getting my childhood best friend evicted from our dorm?", "selftext": "for mine and my roommates safety, i changed all of the names in this story. \n\nfor some context, i (19f), my childhood best friend, Beth (18f), my best friend through middle and high school, Lauren (18f), and an absolutely precious girl from the town over, Lucy (19f) live in an apartment style dorm where we each have our own room, two bathrooms, and a shared living/kitchen space. \n\nsince we are from the south, sororities are a big deal here. beth moved in a week early into our dorm for rush, and ended up getting into Alpha Xi Delta. the night of bid day, she got blackout drunk with her sisters. this was the beginning of a complete downward spiral for her. \n\nof course since she was in a sorority, it was expected that she would be partying and drinking, but she consistently took it was too far. constantly bringing back tons of people we had never met before in the middle of the night, sleeping with multiple guys in a weekend, drinking excessively, and not going to classes. she didn\u2019t have to get a job or pay for college herself because her parents are pretty well off and they would just send her money whenever she asked. Lauren, Lucy, and i have to work out way through college and pay for it all ourselves. \n\nshe started leaving her dirty dishes in the sink for weeks, never cleaned our shared bathroom and would make it absolutely disgusting a day after i cleaned it, leave her pubes in the shower, and left moldy food out for a month. \n\nbeth is not the brightest. she has always been one to brag about illegal things she does to sound cool or impress people, and leaves her door wide open while on facetime with people. a few weeks ago, i over heard her discussing how she was going to sell her ADHD medication to some frat boys. as someone who is also medicated for ADHD, i am more than aware of how stupid, illegal, and dangerous it is. if i don\u2019t take my meds daily, i cannot function. when i asked her if she was serious, beth acted like it was no big deal and that it was funny. \n\nLauren and Lucy both came to me around the same time upset with her behavior as of recently, and that was it for me. they wanted to move out it had gotten so bad. it was one thing if it bothered me, i kinda thought i was just being dramatic or a clean freak, but i knew there was something that needed to be done if it bothered them as well.\n\na few weeks after we had a conversation with our RA about it, we decided to report her for selling her meds. we had video evidence, and if we waited any longer there was a possibility we could get in trouble too. \n\ntwo weeks before we reported her, she had gotten charged with an MUI (minor under the influence) after a bar in our town got raided, so she was already scheduled to have a meeting with community standards at our school a day after we had our meeting with the lady over it discussing her selling her medication. \n\nwe thought for sure she would know we were the ones that reported her, but she was completely clueless. she 100% thought the school tapped her phone, so my roommates and i were some what safe for now. of course, she blabbed everything about the meeting to us, telling us how she lied about selling and whatnot. \n\nwe recorded everything and took it to the community standards lady the next day. \n\nbefore i left for the weekend, i cleaned my room and locked my door. we weren\u2019t sure what she was going to do. when i came back sunday, the place was trashed, it smelled like weed, there were reeces puffs everywhere (Lucy has a deathly nut allergy so she couldn\u2019t come back until everything was disinfected), and to top it all off, my door was wide. open. she had trashed my room and let someone sleep in my bed. when i told her i wasn\u2019t okay with that, she laughed at me like i just told the funniest joke known to man. \n\ni wanted to curl up in a hall and cry, i wanted to run away and never come back. i went in my room and spiraled into a full blown panic attack. the lady we had spoken to told us to use our panic button app that connects to UPD if anything happened over the weekend so she would be alerted immediately, so i pressed it. the police officer came and escorted the people that were there out, agreed it smelled like weed, and Beth disappeared. \n\nno one else was there that weekend, so i ended up in one of my RA friends room who also has really bad anxiety and he helped me calm down a lot. the police officer came to his room and talked to us a bit, and gave me his personal phone number to call him if we needed anything else since he was aware of the entire situation. after discovering the weed they tried to flush, i called him to check it out and it most definitely was weed.\n\nthe next day, we went to see the lady and told her we couldn\u2019t take this anymore. she left the room to call someone and see what she could do, and when she came back she said the best she could do was have her out in 24 hours. \n\nbeth got all her sorority friends to help her move out, and of course Lauren and i were being made fun of and side-eyed the entire time. after she left, we deep cleaned everything so Lucy could come back. it was the last time we had to clean up after her. \n\neven though we suffered so much, i still feel so guilty for going behind her back and getting her kicked out. i did everything i could to try and help her get better but nothing ever worked.", "created_utc": 1700105525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wcwek/aita_for_getting_my_childhood_best_friend_evicted/", "score": 57, "replies": ["NTA. You gave her chances; her behavior is not your fault. You were doing what was best for you and your other roommates. Maybe Beth should have considered not trashing your dorm and trying to sell her meds if she didn't want to get evicted.", "Wow what a wild read. I can only imagine what it must have been like to experience all that first hand.\n\nNTA! Do not feel guilty over any of that. If Beth wants to throw her life in the trash, let her have at it. She sounds like a whirlwind of doomed destruction. I hope you don't consider her your friend anymore after all she did to you and your poor roommates (I mean, the reese's puffs, the trashed room? Absolutely crazy). You did what you could to save her, but she chose her brood of witches instead.", "NTA definitely\n\nThat must have been a very traumatizing experience. I\u2019m very sorry that you had to go through that. I can\u2019t even imagine it. I\u2019ve lived a pretty sheltered life and have been lucky to go through college without having to deal with terrible roommates. \n\nYour other roommates seem like a keeper. Beth is not. She sounds entitled AF and toxic. But if she was not like that before then this could just be a phase and it\u2019s not too late for her to change her ways. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, and if you feel like it, you could reach out to her and tell her how you were hurt by her actions and behavior and you\u2019re worried about her. Anytime she\u2019s ready to be your friend again, you\u2019re not closing your doors permanently. It\u2019s very sad to lose a very dear friend and see them lose their way. \n\nBut do not apologize for what you did though. You were well within your rights to do that. I hope she realizes how she let you down with what she did as your lifelong friend. \n\nSince she was your childhood friend you probably know her folks too. I think it\u2019s okay to rat her out. Maybe I\u2019m getting old (I\u2019m old enough to be your parent) and I have kids, and if I find out through their childhood friend the shit that they\u2019ve been up to in college (that I\u2019m paying for) I\u2019d be eternally grateful to that friend for reaching out to me.", "NTA this situation happens all the time at universities, it's why there's a process in place. I would hope someone would put that sorority on a watch list for encouraging one of the members to behave this way, it's a detriment and a danger to students and the university.\n\nKudos for doing what you did. She is not your friend anymore. Many people change in college and you got to cut the toxic ones out. She attempted to murder your roommate. Honestly replace all the opened food stuff and make sure the epi pen still works. You may have enough to get a protective order (restraining orders are useless, go for the protective order) , if not you may have to wait to see if she does anything.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. She's old enough to understand the consequences of her actions: both you and your roommates are the same age and under stand them. She's making decisions that will put her in prison the victim of a sex crime or both, if not ODing or being murdered. You can't protect her from herself.", "I\u2019m so sorry,I know that a childhood friend can almost feel like a family member and I know firsthand how it feels to lose one. Would it make you feel better to perhaps get in contact with her parents and work with them to get her some help? She definitely needs it and at her age,she\u2019s probably not beyond saving. \n\n Whatever the case,never doubt that you did the right thing for everyone involved. Hopefully,you all can now just get back to doing as well as you can in school moving forward. Best of luck to all of you. \n\nObviously,NTA.", "NTA  I have a feeling Beth isn't going to be attending the same university as you are for much longer. There is this thing called a \"student code of conduct\" that she is most certainly violating by underage drinking and use of Marijuana. I don't know what state you're in, but there isn't anywhere that permits its use under 21 years of age, same as alcohol. Some states still don't allow it at all. \n\nAnd then there is guilt by association. If the campus police found pot in your dorm because someone reported the smell, you would have been kicked out, too, because you'd be just as guilty for not reporting her. Is it worth getting kicked out for someone who can't be bothered to wash her own pubes down the drain after she showers?", "Whoever Beth was when she was a kid, she is not that person now. You don't know her, and you don't owe the person she is any grace based on who she used to be. NTA", "Beth may have been your best friend when you were kids but... she is definitely not your friend now.\n\nPeople change when they finish high school and go onto university.  Some thrive and grow.  Others, like Beth, go wild with the unaccustomed freedom and become... well, AHs.\n\nYou were right to get her evicted, because she was making her other 3 roommates miserable (that includes you, of course!) and generally being an ass.  What she's been doing is foolish (she's never heard of STDs?  Drug overdoses? etc. etc. etc.) selfish and frequently illegal, as well.\n\nIf she doesn't wind up in jail, or a hospital, it'll be a surprise.  Not your problem anymore, though.  Mourn the loss of your childhood friend, because... that friendship is gone.  Beth ended it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nMy only note is that you shouldn't be slut shaming her, it's her call to sleep with anyone she wants.\n\nAll the rest is a nightmare, it's good she's gone, and I'm sure will be failing out (or expelled) soon.  You're not responsible for her choices or actions, she is.  Who you are responsible for is yourself, and you did what you needed to.\n\nGood luck.", "Has anyone tried to call her parents to let them know she is having some sort of crisis?  She sounds like she is in a hard downward spiral and is going to crash soon.  Her life is more important than friendship right now and if I were you, I\u2019d seriously consider talking to them out if true concern", "Nta and one of the hardest things you\u2019ll come to terms with- that she was never your friend. I\u2019ve no doubt you will reflect on circumstances in the past that you gave her the benefit of the doubt but actually she\u2019s just a user.", "Spot on. On top OP, please as yourself if your people pleaser attitude does you any good. It seems you got yourself into a pretty stupid and unhealthy situation by being too lenient towards someone who clearly gave zero shits about you.\n\nTake care\n \n\nNTA obviously"]}
