Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it. They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay and I shouldn't be saying that when I grew my family because of the divorce.\n\nI do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition.

I also get to hear about them getting suspended from school every time I'm at my dad's.\n\nSo I got a lecture and was told I was wrong and acting like a spoiled kid.

Most of these adults in this situation (except for your mom) are deluding themselves because they don't want to admit that their decisions to divorce affects the kids.\n\nThat being said, there are situations where kids are happy that their parents divorced, mostly physically abusive situations, but could also include when one parent is an addict or compulsive spender.", "NTA. The most alarming part of this is that 17 year old OP is the most emotionally healthy one in this group of adults...and he is being told not to share the acknowledgement of feelings with a younger child. Smh.", "NTA. Divorce is hard on any kid and you understand that better than most. I am sure he was happy to talk to someone who didn\u2019t tell him he needs to pretend to be happy about the divorce.", "NTA. You were trying to empathise with a kid who is going through a tough time. Heather was wrong to take that so personally. Even with positively blended families there is often a lengthy adjustment period. Very few kids are happy with their parents getting divorced, even if later in life they are able to look back at it differently.", "You are NTA for commiserating with Kai. He (and you) are both allowed to be unhappy about your respective parents\u2019 divorces. No one wants a broken home life. But please don\u2019t say that NO ONE wants their parents to divorce. My parents fought for most of my life, and by the time they actually got divorced when I was 13 I had been praying for it. It was a hellish place to grow up. Imagine being willing to trade one kind of unhappiness for another because it would be slightly less toxic and painful. No situations are the same.", "NTA Holy toxic positivity, Batman! You are allowed to have negative feelings. It\u2019s okay if those feelings stay the same or change", "NTA, it's good that you were able to let the kid speak without being told he's wrong.\n\nYour comment was fine, it reflected your experience, but I will say it is not all-encompassing - the unfortunate truth is that there are children who are glad their parents divorced (or would have been happier if their parents divorced), and there are lots of situations where the end result of a divorce is the better result for the children. Obviously this varies a lot by circumstance.\n\nThat said, you and Kai are not wrong in your feelings and it's absurd that you're being punished for mentioning it. This is what makes Heather and your dad assholes.", "NTA. It's perfectly normal & ok to be unhappy about a situation that makes you unhappy regardless of the age. There are age appropriate ish ways of expressing it, but yeah, adults suck for trying to pretend that divorce has zero negative impacts on kids.", "You were just trying to empathise with him. \n\nThat said, at my age I've met lots of people who realise their parents' divorce is what was best in a bad situation. Nobody gets married with a plan to divorce but sometimes it's better than stating together. That doesn't mean your feelings and Kai's feelings are not valid though. NTA.", "NTA. You're speaking from your own personal experience and that of your friends. Heather's family and your Dad are delusional. Just because a bunch of adults are happy about a marriage breaking up doesn't mean the kids from that union will be.", "NTA, u u were sharing your personal opinion, and it's natural to not want to see your parents divorced.\n\nAlso the family addition part I feel is the worst reason for being happy about a divorce. That's just... Idek.\n\nBUT, I know people who are happy that their parents are saperated, because they've seen how one treats the other, it's not about the child having parents together, it's about the wife or husband not staying in something that's draining the life out of them. People don't divorce just cos they're fighting a lot. People divorce because there's something that's fundamentally not working, and at a certain age you realise that the happiness of your parents or parent is more important than you not wanting your parents to split up. Sometimes divorce is a much better solution than living in misery. So don't be so mad at your parents for splitting up, even if you don't personally like it.", ">They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay\n\nBut, it is okay. Even if it means the parents fight less, I'm sure the kid would prefer they don't fight *and* stay married. \n\nSure, that's not likely possible, but it doesn't mean the kid can't be bummed. \n\nYou are the only one validating his feelings, so thank you for that. \n\nHe can grow to understand it was for the best, but that doesn't mean he will *like* it. \n\nHe's allowed to *feel* unhappy. \n\nForcing him to swallow these feelings & invalidating him will only be detrimental to his well-being. \n\nThere is *nothing* wrong with acknowledging that you're unhappy. It's actually often healthy.", "NTA. What do they expect? See what happens if you ask Heather when she's divorcing your father (as it's such a positive thing to do).", "NTA\n\nYou validated a sad kid\u2019s feelings when everyone around him keeps telling him he isn\u2019t allowed his feelings. It\u2019s important for a kid going through something so hard to know that the way he feels is normal.", "Total NTA.", "NTA. What you told Kai was very much true for most kids. By acknowledging that fact, and talking to guy about this net reasonable manner you helped validate how he was feeling. These other people telling him he should be glad are not doing him any favors.", "NTA.  You are entitled to your feelings.  Kai is entitled to his feelings.  The only thing you said which may have been untrue is that nobody wants their parents to be divorced.  I\u2019m sure there are kids out there who are thankful for it.  \n\nHere\u2019s why Heather and her sister are pissed: they don\u2019t want to deal with Kai\u2019s emotions so they\u2019re trying to tell him the divorce is actually a good thing.  They\u2019re denying his feelings and they\u2019re trying to tell him how to feel.  You can\u2019t tell someone how they feel.  You literally can\u2019t.  It\u2019s a super unhealthy/toxic behavior they\u2019re engaging in.  \n\nIm sorry for you because I know this is the tip of the iceberg.  They probably do this kind of thing to you, too, because they don\u2019t know how to healthily process emotions.  \n\nHere\u2019s the upside:  you\u2019re 17 and you\u2019re more emotionally intelligent than them.  Don\u2019t let them trick you into thinking this is normal, healthy, mature, adult behavior.  It is not.  \n\nIt sounds like both Heather and your Dad are emotionally unintelligent.  Im not sure how you have a mature conversation with them when they are immature and there\u2019s a huge power imbalance between you.  \n\nHow you approach it comes down to how strongly you feel about the topic.  Idk if you\u2019re emotionally tied to Kai, or maybe you just want to take this opportunity to talk about your own feelings.  \n\nYou could say something like \u201cI understand you disagreed with me validating Kai\u2019s feelings.  In my experience, as a child of divorce, it\u2019s a very traumatic thing. Having been in his position, I know a little empathy goes along way.\u201d  If you need to say more you can segue into what you are or are not willing to do moving forward. Eg. in the future I will not talk to Kai about the divorce; I will not apologize for empathizing with Kai; I will not attend events where Kai will be present; etc.", "NTA but i was VERY happy when my parents divorced. My father made my life miserable. It was the best day of my life when my mom threw him out.", "NTA-you and Kai have a right to express your feelings.", "NTA. You and Kai are absolutely entitled to your feelings and they\u2019re perfectly normal.  Heather and her sister say that divorce is good because it benefitted them perhaps and they want to believe that it was better for everyone so they don\u2019t have to feel bad about how their adult decisions have negatively impacted their kids.", "NTA.  Kai doesn't need how to feel lessons.  He feels how he feels.  No harm in sharing your experience with him.  Be happy.", "NTA - no one wants their parents to separate and your point that Kai's feelings are normal shows more empathy and maturity than the \"adults\" in the room.

It\u2019s also way harder to introduce a new partner successfully than most divorced parents think it\u2019ll be, as if the parent loving the new partner means their kids will love them too.
