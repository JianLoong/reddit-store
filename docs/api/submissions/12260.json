Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it. They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay and I shouldn't be saying that when I grew my family because of the divorce.\n\nI do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition.

The most alarming part of this is that 17 year old OP is the most emotionally healthy one in this group of adults...and he is being told not to share the acknowledgement of feelings with a younger child.

I am sure he was happy to talk to someone who didn\u2019t tell him he needs to pretend to be happy about the divorce.", "NTA. You were trying to empathise with a kid who is going through a tough time. Heather was wrong to take that so personally. Even with positively blended families there is often a lengthy adjustment period. Very few kids are happy with their parents getting divorced, even if later in life they are able to look back at it differently.", "You are NTA for commiserating with Kai. He (and you) are both allowed to be unhappy about your respective parents\u2019 divorces. No one wants a broken home life. But please don\u2019t say that NO ONE wants their parents to divorce. My parents fought for most of my life, and by the time they actually got divorced when I was 13 I had been praying for it. It was a hellish place to grow up. Imagine being willing to trade one kind of unhappiness for another because it would be slightly less toxic and painful. No situations are the same.", "NTA Holy toxic positivity, Batman! You are allowed to have negative feelings. It\u2019s okay if those feelings stay the same or change", "NTA, it's good that you were able to let the kid speak without being told he's wrong.\n\nYour comment was fine, it reflected your experience, but I will say it is not all-encompassing - the unfortunate truth is that there are children who are glad their parents divorced (or would have been happier if their parents divorced), and there are lots of situations where the end result of a divorce is the better result for the children. Obviously this varies a lot by circumstance.\n\nThat said, you and Kai are not wrong in your feelings and it's absurd that you're being punished for mentioning it. This is what makes Heather and your dad assholes.", "NTA. It's perfectly normal & ok to be unhappy about a situation that makes you unhappy regardless of the age. There are age appropriate ish ways of expressing it, but yeah, adults suck for trying to pretend that divorce has zero negative impacts on kids.", "You were just trying to empathise with him. \n\nThat said, at my age I've met lots of people who realise their parents' divorce is what was best in a bad situation. Nobody gets married with a plan to divorce but sometimes it's better than stating together. That doesn't mean your feelings and Kai's feelings are not valid though. NTA.", "NTA. You're speaking from your own personal experience and that of your friends. Heather's family and your Dad are delusional. Just because a bunch of adults are happy about a marriage breaking up doesn't mean the kids from that union will be.", "NTA, u u were sharing your personal opinion, and it's natural to not want to see your parents divorced.\n\nAlso the family addition part I feel is the worst reason for being happy about a divorce. That's just... Idek.\n\nBUT, I know people who are happy that their parents are saperated, because they've seen how one treats the other, it's not about the child having parents together, it's about the wife or husband not staying in something that's draining the life out of them. People don't divorce just cos they're fighting a lot. People divorce because there's something that's fundamentally not working, and at a certain age you realise that the happiness of your parents or parent is more important than you not wanting your parents to split up. Sometimes divorce is a much better solution than living in misery. So don't be so mad at your parents for splitting up, even if you don't personally like it.", ">They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay\n\nBut, it is okay. Even if it means the parents fight less, I'm sure the kid would prefer they don't fight *and* stay married. \n\nSure, that's not likely possible, but it doesn't mean the kid can't be bummed. \n\nYou are the only one validating his feelings, so thank you for that. \n\nHe can grow to understand it was for the best, but that doesn't mean he will *like* it. \n\nHe's allowed to *feel* unhappy. \n\nForcing him to swallow these feelings & invalidating him will only be detrimental to his well-being. \n\nThere is *nothing* wrong with acknowledging that you're unhappy. It's actually often healthy.", "NTA. What do they expect?

It\u2019s important for a kid going through something so hard to know that the way he feels is normal.", "Total NTA.", "NTA. What you told Kai was very much true for most kids. By acknowledging that fact, and talking to guy about this net reasonable manner you helped validate how he was feeling. These other people telling him he should be glad are not doing him any favors.", "NTA.  You are entitled to your feelings.  Kai is entitled to his feelings.  The only thing you said which may have been untrue is that nobody wants their parents to be divorced.  I\u2019m sure there are kids out there who are thankful for it.  \n\nHere\u2019s why Heather and her sister are pissed: they don\u2019t want to deal with Kai\u2019s emotions so they\u2019re trying to tell him the divorce is actually a good thing.  They\u2019re denying his feelings and they\u2019re trying to tell him how to feel.  You can\u2019t tell someone how they feel.  You literally can\u2019t.  It\u2019s a super unhealthy/toxic behavior they\u2019re engaging in.  \n\nIm sorry for you because I know this is the tip of the iceberg.  They probably do this kind of thing to you, too, because they don\u2019t know how to healthily process emotions.  \n\nHere\u2019s the upside:  you\u2019re 17 and you\u2019re more emotionally intelligent than them.  Don\u2019t let them trick you into thinking this is normal, healthy, mature, adult behavior.  It is not.  \n\nIt sounds like both Heather and your Dad are emotionally unintelligent.  Im not sure how you have a mature conversation with them when they are immature and there\u2019s a huge power imbalance between you.  \n\nHow you approach it comes down to how strongly you feel about the topic.  Idk if you\u2019re emotionally tied to Kai, or maybe you just want to take this opportunity to talk about your own feelings.  \n\nYou could say something like \u201cI understand you disagreed with me validating Kai\u2019s feelings.  In my experience, as a child of divorce, it\u2019s a very traumatic thing. Having been in his position, I know a little empathy goes along way.\u201d  If you need to say more you can segue into what you are or are not willing to do moving forward.

No one I know enjoyed having to juggle custody or going without one of their parents for holidays. No part of packing up everything important and dragging it from house to house was enjoyable. My parents still fought so badly they couldn't go to any school functions because of how often they got into screaming fights in public. \n\nAnd research itself supports that children who experience divorce usually have a hard time. Some adjust, but some will deal with the side effects from that trauma for the rest of their life. Children of divorced parents have higher rates of mental health problems. \n\nThat's not to say the parents shouldn't divorce if the marriage is at its breaking point, but it's doing no one any favors to pretend it's a good thing for the children involved. It would be better if they offered proper support to Kai instead of trying to forcibly pretend everything is okay.", "ESH except kid. I had a very interesting upbringing (my early memories of my dad was visiting him in prison. My mom waited for him to get out, they married and it lasted less than a month) I did not like them living together. I didn't like how they treated one another, and cops coming, etc. That's my experience and I know it varies with others.\n\nI however wouldn't tell a child that no kids wouldn't want their kid to divorce because that simply isn't true. Instead, I would make them feel valid in their feelings, but not generalize all kids feel this way because I know my lived experiences differ than another and because if that, they may not necessarily feel the way I do.\n\nReassure it's ok to not be happy with the situation and their feelings are valid but, I guess I'm just one to have more of an open mind to other possibilities than just my own. And parents suck because well, don't shame a kid to not feel happy about the divorce because well, again, I know how it feels to have your feelings disregarded about the marital status of parents and you not even  being considered. The kid shouldn't be responsible in being happy for their parents' sake, but the parents need to make sure the transition is healthy for the kid and making sure they're happy.", "NTA\n\nKai got some empathy and someone listening to him, rather than a bunch of folk trying to ride roughshod over his emotions and telling him he\u2019s wrong for how he feels.", "NTA. You were empathizing with what the boy was feeling unlike everyone else around him trying to gaslight him out of his own valid emotions.", "NTA. It sounds like you and Kai are being more honest about your feelings than many of the adults in the room.", "NTA -- OP you helped that poor kid in ways you might never know. You helped him feel seen and his feelings validated. It is obvious both of those are rare occurrences. The way other family members were so quick to say the child had no right to his feelings drove the point home.   \n\n\nYou chose to be honest and empathetic. You let a small person who has so little control in their life a moment to feel like they matter. You did a good thing.", "NTA. But I spent most of my childhood wishing my parents would get divorced. Of course, my mom was abusive, so that\u2019s kind of a different situation. (She got a lot of therapy later in life and did improve, but if I were my dad, I still wouldn\u2019t put up with how she treats him.)", "NTA\n\nI grew up with divorced parents. When my fiance and I got together, i REFUSED to do anything that would jeapordize the relationship with his kids. That included not moving in together right away. We get married in October and just moved in together in January. We'll have been together 3 years by the time we get married.\n\nYou acknowledged the kids feelings and validated them. Shoot, my parents divorced before i was born and i grew up with a WONDERFUL bonus mom and I still at times wished they were together. That's all it takes. He now knows that he can come to you when he has to vent about his parents being divorced.", "nta", "NTA Kai has every right to feel whatever he wants about the situation, he's entitled to his feelings. Though I actually disagree with your statement, my parents divorced when I was 15 and i was immensely glad for it (even before that, by age 10-11 I remember already hoping they would split up) because the environment was just that bad and toxic, never even thought about wanting them to be back together, even for a second. \n\nBut that's the thing, every situation is different and everyone is gonna go through it in their own way, experiences are not universal. And no one should have one way pushed as the standard way to feel just because it fits the narrative their environment tries to push on them.", "NTA. Divorce sucks. Especially for a kid that age. I was 1 1/2 when my dad and mom split. She remarried when I was 3/4. They divorced before I was 10. She then remarried again by the time I was 12. And just finalized that divorce last May. My dad remarried when I was 3. Divorced his second wife before I turned 8. And married his current wife when I was about 10. My mom is now remarried as of January this year. \n\nThe first two divorces of both KILLED me mentally as a kid. My step parents and I at the time were extremely close. I\u2019m 26 and STILL have relationships with my first stepmom and first stepdad. The thirds can kick cans. Everyone always said \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Or \u201cIt will be better for everyone\u201d But at that young of an age to watch your parents fight and then divorce what else are you supposed to think? We grow up and expect our parents to stay together. Yeah it doesn\u2019t always happen but as children it\u2019s what we want and dream of. Especially when everyone talks about how shitty divorce is in front of us. \n\nYou did the right thing. That kid needs someone who will support him through this. People forget how traumatic divorce can be for a child.", "NTA\n\nYou're allowed to express your feelings. Tell Heather she is toxic for telling your to repress them, and if her kids grow up like that, they're going to be horrible humans to be around.", "NTA. Thank you for being real with him while others are showering him with toxic positivity and backseat driving.", "NTA for actually allowing him to feel emotions that are normal for when your parents are going through a divorce. He needs to feel supported, not just his parents which you seem to be the only one who gets that. I don\u2019t think you really believe that nobody wants their parents to divorce because there are definitely a lot of people who do but your family can\u2019t be mad at you for saying that the people who you do know are upset.", "NTA and this is so ironic. Your STEP MOM is telling you how to feel about your parents divorce and is trying to shove a happy response into an 8 y/o who's also going thru the same sht you went through. You showed empathy and were trying to listen to your cousin's woes and your STEP MOM punishes you? This would have elicited a middle finger from me on the way out the door to my mom's house.", "You're incorrect, but NTA. This kid is miserable, and that's all that matters. But my parents should have gotten divorced 18 years before they did. Plenty of kids are relieved when their parents stop believing the BS in the perfect parenting books around the house and just get divorced already. But this particular kid doesn't, so that's irrelevant. He need sympathy, not people telling him to stop bumming them out by being sad.", "NTA.\n\nYou are going to be the one Kai remembers as actually having listened to him and validated his feelings instead of demanding he feel something else about it.\n\nSome people come around on the divorce later, or realise in retrospect it was for the best (if a parent was abusive, neglectful, or just not in a good place to care for them) or that even if they still don't like it, can understand their parents are obviously incompatible in serious ways.\n\nYour Dad sounds like he has become a Heather Parrot, so I wouldn't be listening to him. It doesn't sound like he's had your best interests in mind for a good long while, like Kai's mum, who hasn't even completed the divorce yet, and has moved a whole guy in, and doesn't seem to actually care that Kai is unhappy, just steamrolling him into saying he is.", "NTA. You were seemingly the only one understanding of Kai's feelings. All the adults suck in trying to force Kai to be happy with his parents' divorce.", "NTA - adult previous-child-of-divorce here... you are spot on 100%. you told him the truth. you commiserated with him. It's not your job to lie and pretend, he needed to feel validated and clearly the adults didn't seem to want to allow him to have his own feelings about it all. Honestly that's just sad :(", "NTA. You were telling Kai the truth. Kai has the right to feel whatever he feels about the divorce and everything else. WTF?", "File for emancipation from your father, tell him you wholeheartedly agree how divorce can be an amazing thing! So good that you want one from him.", "NTA\n\nI first thought this post was going to be you telling the 8yo to toughen up, but you were empathizing with him.\n\nIt's OK to be unhappy about a divorce.  Being sad is OK.  Commiserating with someone who is sad is OK.  Having empathy is good.\n\nChildren, particularly young children, have no obligation to be \"happy for their parents\".  If it's an abusive home or a terrible situation is being fixed, sure it probably will be better - but that doesn't eliminate the sense of loss and sorrow a divorce causes.\n\nI could probably post this on every divorce thread in this sub: the kids didn't choose the divorce/remarriage/etc.  It's not their job to make it work or make other people feel good about it.", "NTA\n\nI may be an adult now, but I was a child of divorce. Was I upset at the time it happened? Absolutely. I was younger than Kai, and I didn\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t until a grew a bit older that I realized how absolutely toxic their relationship was. Then, as an adult, I thought about what my life would have been like had they not divorced. My mother wouldn\u2019t have started a business with my step-dad. She likely would have lost the house after he spent all their money, and we would have had to move into some cheap apartment instead of making the move to the other side of the state into a beautiful home on a river. My mental health wouldn\u2019t have been so easily managed, let alone my mom\u2019s or sister\u2019s. Child me didn\u2019t grasp what kind of person my father was, but hindsight is 20/20.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean how each parent\u2019s life goes is going to be roses for the kids. Sometimes parents choose an even worse spouse. Sometimes they pay more attention to their new relationship rather than nurturing the one with their child. There are endless possibilities here. My parents divorce was the absolute best thing to ever happen to my mother. My father screwing up the relationship to begin with was likely the worse decision he ever made, but honestly, he would have screwed it up in all sorts of other ways, because he was a screw up of epic proportions. Either way, every person is unique, so every situation is unique.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly understandable to hate having your parents divorce, but in the long run, you realize divorce is better for everyone. If my mom had remained married to my dad, he would have continued to cheat on her. He would have continued pissing away every dollar she made. As you get older, you realize that your parents staying together for the sake of the children only makes their lives miserable, and only worsens that children\u2018s childhood. But yes, it can be quite painful while you\u2018re going through the process.\n\nThat said, the adults in this child\u2019s life are telling him that what he is feeling is wrong. His emotions aren\u2019t valid, and he should feel this instead. That only makes everything worse. He had every right to feel what he feels, and them trying to put a lid on it and force him to put a smile on his face only teaches him to not express himself out of fear of being invalidated over and over again. It forces him to have everything build up inside him, which can cause a lot of damage to a child\u2019s psyche. \n\nThese adults are doing this child a disservice. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a common tactic for adults to use, thinking that if they sweep everything under the rug and put a smile on their own face, the child will just follow suit. It doesn\u2019t work like that. What they need to do is put provide a child therapist for Kai, so he can work through these emotions he\u2019s feeling is a safe environment. They are handling this situation entirely wrong, and you were absolutely right to  handle it the way you did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay \n\nGod, these people sound truly exhausting. Quit invalidating your children\u2019s emotions, people! Listen to them, and allow them to express how they feel. Telling him how to feel about it isn\u2019t going to magically solve $hit, it\u2019s just going to make them feel like they can\u2019t talk to you about things.", "NTA. Bravo for hearing the kid out and acknowledging his feelings. I was prepared to call you an AH over the statement about nobody wanting their parents to divorce but after reading your post I realise I misread and you have presented this statement subjectively by saying \u201cnobody you knew\u201d which is okay!", "NTA - what you did was actually the most supportive, kindest, most family-like thing out of anybody in either of your families. You empathized with the kid, shared your experience with him, and validated his feelings. The grownups should be taking notes.", "NTA. I am not a person with divorced parents, but this kid clearly needed someone to talk to. The fact that they are saying you're in the wrong for letting him know that his feelings are valid, is a problem. He isn't allowed to be sad or upset about his parents splitting up? He's 8. He knows how he is feeling and they don't even console him about it.", "NTA. Validating his feelings was the right thing to do. You can't just tell a kid to be happy about something they're not happy about and expect them to be happy. That's not how emotions work. His life is changing in a huge way, and he has no control over what happens. Adults wouldn't be happy about that, so I don't know why they expect a child to be happy about it.", "NTA. Divorce is hard in children and why would they want their family to be separated when that\u2019s all they know from a young age? Sure when you\u2019re older you look back on things and think to yourself it was good they got divorced, but as a kid it sucks. Those adults are all insufferable for making you out to be this villain.", "NTA, Kai is going through and extremely difficult time, and for all of it, he's been alone. Everyone is telling him he should be happy, but in reality his entire WORLD is falling apart. You talking to Kai, about how you ACTUALLY understand and that he isn't alone will help him more than others just telling him to be happy.\n\nAs a child whose parents divorced, I also wish it never happened.", "NTA.  This is one kid of divorce telling another kid of divorce that it's alright to not be happy about their parents divorcing.  Not really seeing the issue.  Divorce can make a child feel isolated like they are the only ones going through a difficult time.  People need to stop making the kid feel like they are wrong in their feelings.", "NTA,  it's OK to be upset about a major change in your life, especially when it's something you don't have control over.  It's also OK to acknowledge that there may be some positives, mom and dad not fighting / less stressful home environment.  However to say that you have to be happy or have to be sad is not OK.  You acknowledge, empathized and shared your experiences with how Kai was feeling, sadly none of the adults are doing that for Kai.", "YTA because I know ALOT of people who wished and still wish their parents would divorce.", "NTA. You shared your experience. Divorce is hard for sure. As a teacher, I\u2019ve taught many kids with divorced parents (a little more than 50% of my kids, honestly) and they pretty much all struggled at first with the idea. That being said, I had many write in their senior memory books about how much better they felt once things settled down and adjusted. I\u2019ve had more than a few kids say they were grateful for their parents\u2019 divorce because of how bad things had gotten at home. It was a really interesting perspective to hear. Most of my students\u2019 parents had been divorced for quite awhile by the time they got to me as seniors and I could understand why they felt that way. It seemed the ones with the best coparenting situations were the ones who said they were okay with it.", "NTA.  If all the people around him are just gaslighting him into thinking divorce is a great thing and he should be happy about it, he is being alienated and shamed for his feelings.  You helped him to understand that his feelings are normal and he shouldn't feel ashamed of them.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nAll you did was empathize with a kid who just needed someone to understand. If that makes the adults uncomfortable, they can deal with that themselves.", "NTA Kai needed to hear his feelings are valid.  I am sorry yours are not in your dad\u2019s home.", "When I was a teenager, my younger sister and I would try to talk my mom into divorcing my abusive dad. That never happened and I went NC and LC to avoid them. Sure, it would suck being from a divorced family, but that seems a lot better than living with an abusive bully who would hit his kids if he felt we didn't handle his bullying however he felt was correct in the moment.", "NTA, but for the title, you might find people disagree with you\n\n- the child of parents who should have gotten divorced and never did (and it fucked me up bc of it)", "I was extremely relieved when I was 13 to hear my parents were getting a divorce. My father was an emotionally abusive, raging narcissist and getting distance from him was necessary for my mental health. One of my oldest friend's had a step father who was physically abusive and AFAIK, he was happy when his mother divorced him.\n\nYou did the right thing in hearing Kai and not dismissing his feeling. Anyone telling him they it was wrong to feel unhappy were doing him a great disservice. \n\nThat said, I think you went too far in telling him no children are ever happy about their parent's divorce. I don't think you saying this rises to the level of being an asshole, it definitely wasn't necessary in comforting Kai and in the worst case, could cause problems in the future (imagine Kai truly taking it to heart that no child is ever happy about divorce and then meeting someone like me - would he be able to accept my feelings or would he end up doing to me what is being done to him).", "NTA. I'm glad Kai had someone to support him (ever so briefly - his family sound like jerks) as he mourns the family life he knew and his parents marriage.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of kids that are happy their parents divorced. My mother and her sisters made my gran divorce my mentally ill alcoholic grandfather in the 50s and they were pretty happy about that development.\n\nNever met the man.

But they were happy they divorced.", "First, no NTA for what you said, though if your position is that no one is happy when their parents divorce you are just completely wrong. When I was younger, I wanted nothing more than for my parents to divorce. Even as an adult I still wish they would divorce. They genuinely bring out the absolute worst in each other.\n\nSecond, if you are old enough (it sounds like you are) you can petition the court to modify visitation to suit your preferences. Forced visitation is more of a thing with younger kids, but older kids are often granted much more discretion with visitation.", "NTA this poor kid needs someone to talk to, and you were giving that to him, and telling him his feelings  were ok - you did the right thing. Shame on Heather and her sister for how they responded.", "Nta, but careful with this one, OP, there's not many ways to \"win\" here. Even those happy the fighting is ending don't generally feel happy about what usually constitutes at very least a change in housing, schedule, time with adults and extended family, and so many other things, and you're talking to two people invested in you toeing the party line. \n\nBoth Heather and her sister, a stepmother whose marriage and maybe children wouldn't exist if your parents hadn't divorced, and her sister, who may be feeling anger, joy, relief, and a thousand other things that don't currently include guilt because she's shifting her son's life too, about papers he never signed. \n\nBut she is. Keep conversations with Kai quiet and be attentive to where you speak to him and who's around, but sounds like you're a voice for him that you needed - especially when the new family claims the world is better for the struggle they didn't see.", "NTA. Those adults suck. Even in cases where divorce is better for the family in the long run, it's still almost always really hard on the kids, and these adults are basically saying he isn't allowed to mourn or have his own feelings about his life turning upside down.

That communicates to the kid that things aren\u2019t going to get better and that divorce is definitely going to be worse than what he had before.  Things won\u2019t feel so bad forever is a message that the rest of his family had been trying to communicate and although unintentionally (and that\u2019s why your not an AH in this situation) you communicated to him that things will feel just as bad as he feels now forever.", "NTA. And at 8, even if his parents fight a lot, he probably still had hope that someday he'd have a happy family when it would be less fighting and more good times. Divorce to kids means that your whole world is being flipped upside down and nothing is ever going to be the same as it was before. Maybe eventually it will become more stable but if the kid is in the throes of it, he needs someone to validate his feelings and help him process. \n\nI will add, however, I don't know how you said it to Kai but maybe you made him feel worse and not better. If you were saying it from a place of empathy, as in \"welcome to the club, kid, it sucks but you'll get through it.\" Or, if it was more of \"oh, yeah. This is actually worse than you think it is\" which might give him nightmares. Your words and intent matter in this case. OP, you aren't that clear about that so you might be a bit of an AH.

There is a difference between telling the kid his feelings are totally normal and okay, and painting divorce as a universal negative and selfish act by the parents.", "There may be some kids who are relieved to have their parents divorce, if the fighting and hostility were open and volatile, but most children would probably rather have unhappy parents stay together than have them divorce for the sake of the parents' well-being. It would be a rare child who would be mature and selfless enough to want their parents to divorce to make the parents happier. People should understand that when they divorce, their children are highly unlikely to be happy about it. I think a lot of divorcing parents tell themselves it's for the best for everyone because they don't want to feel guilty about disrupting their kids' lives.\n\nAnd the line about being happy about \"growing their family\" is ridiculous. If that's the case couples should divorce and remarry every year so their kids could have as many stepsiblings as they can possibly give them.

It takes a long time for a child to realize they didn't want their parents not to divorce, they wanted their parents to have a happy relationship and keep the family a cohesive unit. OP and Kai will recognize this one day.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily have to be today. Being a kid in a split custody situation fucking *blows* and kids deserve to be heard when they say they're unhappy. Maybe nobody can do anything to fix it, but that's just another life lesson they have to work through... And it's a lot easier when adults validate your feelings.", "Yes! It is sad that as adults we do not understand we need to validate a child\u2019s feelings and not dismiss them so it fits the adult\u2019s narrative. Everyone is allowed to feel how they feel. \n\nOP - you are acting more grownup than the adults in this scenario. NTA", "But we don't know each other. I said nobody I knew was glad or wanted it.", "It's taken second place for me as the worst thing. First is dad marrying Heather. So that's a positive I suppose.", "I never said ALL kids. I said all the people I knew with divorced parents. I can't speak for every person but I can express what those I do know have told me.", "I wonder if OP is still going to think what he did was good in 10 years.", "I didn't say it about everybody just everybody I knew with divorced parents.", "I never said nobody likes it. Just that nobody I know likes it and that is true. Everyone I know with divorced parents has admitted they don't like it and wish it were different.", "100% agree with this, but I think this is a long view, and the 17-year-old OP may not have that perspective yet.", "Agreed. Anecdotally, I was super happy when my parents finally divorced. They should have done it about 9 years earlier & spared us all a lot of misery.", "Definitely agree with this! I think I was about 7 when I started wishing my parents would divorce. They finally separated when I was 16, and I was totally thrilled, and life was much more happy and peaceful afterwards. Staying together \"for the sake of the children\" is not a good idea, when one of the parents makes home life hell.", "I don\u2019t think we read the same post. OP said nobody they KNOW is happy their parents divorced. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s negative or selfish of the parents. Just saying it\u2019s among everyone they know a pretty upsetting situation.\n\n\nWhich even for toxic parents marriages divorce can be full of uncertainty, changes kids don\u2019t know how to deal with, and is upsetting. You can be glad you don\u2019t have to deal with parents screaming at each other without being happy your whole life is changing and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nI mean my parents filed for divorce ON MY BIRTHDAY when I was 8. Still gives me icky feelings at 42, and my mom is dead and my dad has been missing for 11 years.", "Agreed, my dad was abusive and my mom divorcing him saved her life and was the best thing that happened in my childhood, so I was ecstatic when it happened. But, I understand OP not having the life experience to have that insight.", "Divorce sucks for kids. \n\nIf their parents\u2019 marriage was such a raging dumpster fire that divorce feels like sweet relief, well, that\u2019s not quite the recommendation some make it out to be.\n\nIt sucks.

The resources of two adults focused on one household are now the resources of (hopefully) both adults divided between two households and lawyers.

Better hope they\u2019re not in some self-involved haze of second adolescence as they rediscover dating. \n\nIt sucks.

However, the OP did nothing wrong.  He said \"nobody he knew was happy when their parents had divorced.\"  He said from his experience, and was not making a general statement.\n\nAnd it wouldn't have been helpful to the kid anyway to tell him that some children were happy that their parents were divorced.  So, what is exactly your point?\n\nETA: The OP also never implied that divorcing parents are selfish.  Where did this come from?\n\n>There is a difference between telling the kid his feelings are totally normal and okay, and painting divorce as a universal negative and selfish act by the parents.", "Perfect reply.", ">they should be happy that the family grew.\n\nYeah, this is a messed up way for a parent to assuage their guilt.", "This. \n\nI didn\u2019t understand the divorce when I was five. Hell, I thought my dad walked on water for a few years after this. \n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of all the cheating. Later on in life, he actually had the balls to tell me that the divorce was my mom\u2019s fault, because if she truly loved him, she would have forgiven the cheating. Mind you, this wasn\u2019t even the first time he was caught cheating. \n\nThe vehicle he bought while they were separated, and put both their names on it, only to avoid paying, which tanked my mother\u2019s credit. \n\nMy father was an absolutely horrible human being. I still remember being around seven or eight, and having him come over to pick me up. He was going to take me to the movies, but ended up spending the money on drugs. He said he didn\u2019t have the money to take me, but that if I had any money saved up In my piggy bank, we could still go. When my mom saw me grabbing my allowance money, she kicked his ass out. \n\nThat bastard legit left me at a hotel after making me walk two miles in the winter after his girlfriend kicked him out. A hotel night manager saw me wandering around by myself, and called the cops. When my dad returned to the hotel, he had cocaine on him. He legit left child me completely alone to go buy drugs. \n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget my ninth birthday, when I had my party at his apartment, and he drove us all down to the bar because he got a call that that same girlfriend was hitting on some guy. He beat the guy up. Our parents all had to pick us up from the police station. \n\nAfter he died, I was finally at peace. All of our lives would have been so much worse if they hadn\u2019t divorced, but that didn\u2019t stop five-year-old me from screaming at my mom to let him stay. And bless her, she never spoke ill of him when I was a child. She stopped allowing him to see us as often, less the times where he was able to fake getting his act together, but she remained strong and built an incredible life for herself and for her kids after that divorce. \n\nYou think about if parents stay together, and what the child will view as a completely normal, healthy relationship. The standards that are created in their head for their own future relationships. When you\u2019re young, you can\u2019t see all that. You just want your family to stay together. Children are incredibly perceptive, yet it\u2019s difficult to see a lot of truths through the pain.", "I'm so sorry that was your childhood, and so glad you realized and said this. When something odd or bad is your normal, and you don't see anything to challenge it, then you accept it as the way things are. \n\nI am so pleased that your mom was able to save all of you, and that you came to realize that.\n\nHugs all around.", "I was thrilled when my parents told me they were getting divorced.", "My parent aren't divorced but I really wished they would divorce as a kid. I would have fucking celebrated if they'd decided to divorce.", "Exactly like most kids wont be happy to loose their normal and the family dynamics they have been used to especially if they don\u2019t yet recognise those family dynamics as bad. It takes time (and the parents being decent parents) for the new, healthier and overall better dynamic to come into place and for the change to have settled in enough that they can look back and recognise things did get better.", "I know a few. Are you willing to bet the whole world? Stop making assumptions. You can't play psych with a kid.", "I mean, from their child perspective, but if two people who didn't like each other kept staying for the sake of the kid, how is that even better? I know I rather my mom divorce my dad than still be married to make it work because of appearances  or child's sake. That's just patents not being mature enough to actually address the issue like adults and instead, become resentful and toxic and it shows.\n\nAs I said, my experience was a bit different because they had me, he went to prison a few years later, he got out when I was 7, they married and separated within a month. And I was never close to my dad anyway (that I don't call him dad) My family unit has primarily been my mom and maternal older brother.\n\nDepending on how much the child is exposed to, will definitely shape how they feel about parents divorcing (I mean, I know my home life wasn't like that till he moved in and my mom was sad. ) Again, I know I personally would just approach this with more open perspective just based off my experience", "[removed]", "My parent both became much better people after the divorce I longed for them to have.", "Agree with this.

My life would have been extremely better and healthier.", "I used to beg my mother to get a divorce from the time I was like 13. They stayed married another miserable 22 years after that and it was hell on all of us.", "Same, and sort of for the reasons Kai's relatives suggest. I didn't want my little brother to have to hear the constant arguing as he was getting old enough to pick up on things, and I'd moved out so I couldn't distract him anymore. Sometimes it does just need to happen. Problem with the family isn't that they're talking about the silver lining, it's that they're trying to use it to cover up any feelings of sadness Kai is dealing with. Extreme positivity is toxic and the kid needs warmth and empathy right now. OP is definitely NTA.", "Same with mine. It wasn't all easy - there were rough spots and a lot of adjustments but as an adult, it's the only reason I have relationships with them at all.", "This. My sister and I used to pray (literally) for divorce to get the screaming and fighting to stop. They\u2019re still married and it\u2019s only gotten worse. Luckily we\u2019re grown, on our own, and in therapy but man those younger years were rough.", "I agree OP is NTA.", "My parents are mostly ok on their own, but my mom was abusive towards me.\nOnce I removed myself from the equation, they are okayish on their own. I think.", "NTA. Like others have said, you validated what Kai is feeling/experiencing, and that is good and healthy. My parents got divorced during my sophomore year of college and it was rough. It's been 20 years, and while I'll agree that both of my parents are happy now, I am still not happy about the fact that it happened. I would have been a lot happier if they'd found a way to be happy with each other. That didn't happen, and I'm at peace with that and love each of their partners. Plus my kid has 7 grandparents.\n\nAnd at 19, I wasn't living at home full time, it definitely didn't impact me the same way it does kids who are younger and go through it. But it was still devastating. And I had friends at college whose parents had divorced a year or two earlier, and you know what they did? Commiserated with me. Even professors whose parents had divorced decades earlier.\n\nYou did the compassionate, human thing and befriended a child who is going through a very difficult situation, one that you have gone through. The adults here are all bonkers, deluding themselves for thinking that kids should be happy about their parents finding new partners, gaining new family members, etc. They're focusing on ONLY the \"positive\" aspects (a stretch of that word in a lot of situations) and completely ignoring the disruption and uncertainty that divorce imposes on a child. A child who is completely without agency in the situation. The adults are choosing to divorce - even if they're not happy about it, they are still active parties. Kids are just along for the ride. And they are allowed to have their feelings about that, both negative and positive.\n\nFeel free to tell your Dad that when he invalidates your very real feelings about this, you are less likely to share anything with him. He's harming your relationship. He should be listening to you, not telling you how to feel.", "NAH. I think talking with Kai honestly was completely fine, as is expressing your feelings on your own parent\u2019s divorce. He probably appreciates talking to someone who has been in his shoes. HOWEVER, not all divorces are the same and using blanket statements like \u201cno kids are happy with having divorced parents\u201d can also not be accurate or helpful. Sometimes divorces are what\u2019s best for everyone, even if no one sees it until way later on. You are only 17 so no one expects you to realize that yourself either at this point in life. \n\nI think a better approach would have been to just be a sounding board for Kai and listen to his feelings and sympathize with him so that he know\u2019s he\u2019s not alone and his feelings are valid and being heard by someone.", "NTA. Divorce is the number one issue giving kids a disadvantage in modern society, and it's very selfish to divorce instead of working hard on your marriage if there's kids involved. Heather and your dad likely felt embarrassed and called out for their actions so they punished you to keep the fiction in their head alive that divorce was best for you.", "NTA\n\nI'm sure your words helped that kid more than any other \"adult\" in his life (I know you're not an adult yet but to an 8 year old, a 17 year old is adult like). Why anyone would tell a kid to be happy about their life as they know it complete imploding with multiple changes is beyond me.", "NTA you validated Kai\u2019s feelings in a way his mom wasn\u2019t. Divorce sucks ass all around and kids need a safe person to vent to without being compelled to change their view or ignore their feelings", "Nta. When I was just a little older than Kai, my parents almost divorced. They separated at some point (dad went to live somewhere else, and we lived  at my grandma's with my mum). I remember my mum sitting me down and explaining why they wanted to split, and i cried, and was angry at my dad, but I still wanted them together. Now that I'm an adult I understand, but at that age it doesn't make sense. \n\nAnd you did nothing wrong, you simply acknowledged a kid's feelings and empathised with them. For some reason the older people in our lives want us to always be happy about the silver lining in a situation and invalidate our feelings about the actual situation. I lived with an emotionally abusive grandma for a while, and I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone or complain because \"I should be happy I wasn't homeless\". The one time I talked to a cousin and the adults knew, I was berated for months.", "You were comforting a hurting kid and treating him with respect by actually validating his feelings.

Also, you should be old enough to state which parent you want to stay with and the Courts would probably listen.", "NTA personally I was pretty happy my parents divorced but that\u2019s not the point. The point is that you and Kai were having a conversation about your honest feelings, and you were validating Kai\u2019s feelings which are perfectly valid.

By forcing the issue, they\u2019re guaranteeing Kai is going to hate the divorce even more", "Here's the thing. My parents are separated since where I'm from, there is no divorce. They called it quits in '00, mom moved her and me out of our house in '02 (in what I thought for the longest time as the day they separated), and their separation became legal and official in 2015, when I was 4, 6 and 19, respectively. By the time their separation was going through the legal course, I have learned to accept the circumstances surrounding their separation and that what happened was best for all of us. But it was hell for me when I was a kid. Especially since single parenthood and broken families weren't the norm back in the early 00s, and especially since the guy my mom dated after my dad was a total nightmare.\n\nTake it from me: a kid below the age of 10 would never understand why their parents' divorce would be any way beneficial for them because all they crave was a happy and complete family. I remember that in all of my birthdays from age 7 through 14 (because at the time I thought my parents separated when I was 6 and not 4), my only wish was for my parents to get back together. Believe me, Kai is **ALLOWED** to feel what he feels. It's okay to be unhappy in the midst of all of this.

You allowed him to vent his feelings and get rid of them a little instead of making him feel obligated to bottle everything up inside. Things aren't fine! Everything is changing, nothing is going the way *he* would like things to go, and he's probably losing more than he's gaining in the process. There's a stranger living in his house and his mom is acting like a weirdo!

He just wants his family to stay together and to not have to change a lot or deal with his parents new partners or kids.  Fair enough! \n\nEmpathize with him.  That's great,  but it's not actually that realistic,  especially as he gets older,  that he will find any adults who thought their parents should have stayed together.

Just because the parents can provide better lives for their child(ren) divorced than married doesn't mean the situation still isn't EXTREMELY difficult on the kids.

Its OK to validate their feelings. Its not the parents job to always try and make the kids feel better - that's a losing battle for everyone and its not helpful. Its the parents job to help their kids navigate feelings and emotions - to process them and learn to sit with negative emotions. Not to bury them down and only focus on the positive. \n\nDespite what the adults are saying (which is coming from a place of shame and their own emotional immaturity), you did Kai a huge favor. Don't discount how much of a positive impact just that one conversation had on him. He's been feeling SO alone and SO invalidated - he keeps being told that his feelings are wrong, that he should be feeling other things. That so isolating and scary for a young child!

And yes, there are some \u201cbright sides\u201d to divorce sometimes, even for the kids. But there are also parts that are confusing and difficult and a even little scary, especially for an 8yo. The idea that your parents have stopped loving each other, seeing them be romantic with other people in a way you\u2019ve only seen them with each other, feeling pressured to accept strangers as new family, splitting holidays and moving between houses all the time. That\u2019s a LOT of new experiences that can be hard for a little kid to process, and instead of helping him process his feelings about it, his family is telling him it\u2019s \u201cnot ok\u201d to be any less than thrilled about it. \n\nYou didn\u2019t like open Kai\u2019s eyes or introduce the idea that divorce can suck to him by talking about it. He\u2019s not stupid. He already had those thoughts and feelings himself. You were just the only one who listened and made an attempt to empathize with him. You\u2019re the only one NOT an asshole here. Everyone else is completely denying his reality and making him feel like he\u2019s doing something wrong just by feeling the way he feels. \n\nI have two guesses as to why they might be doing this. First guess: they know how traumatic a divorce can be to kids, and their misguided solution is to focus ONLY on the positive things because how could you have any trauma about something you didn\u2019t *know* was traumatic? Good intentions, stupid idea. Maybe if they\u2019d gotten divorced when he was 2-3 they\u2019d have a better chance of shaping his perception of it, but he\u2019s 8. He\u2019s communicated pretty clearly that he sees things differently and that he\u2019s struggling. \n\nSecond guess: To the parents and other adult family members, it really is a happy thing. They\u2019ve gotten out of a relationship that makes them miserable and now they have a second chance to build a perfect, happy family. Having to acknowledge that this choice is difficult and painful for their child is bursting that bubble. It would be so much easier if the kid would just play along with this new family and be happy too. Children are not one-dimensional side characters in your love story that you can rewrite to suit the narrative you want. He is experiencing this situation from a totally different perspective and it\u2019s the parents job to recognize that and help him navigate it, separately from their own.", "My parents are divorced. If they didn't divorce they would have completely destroyed the family, both them and us. They yelled every single night and would hurt themselves (**themselves. not each other nor us kids**) while I tried to console my crying sister in the other room. They can barely stay in the same room together now, so divorcing definitely spared them and us many mental issues. But I understand people who are sad about their parent's divorces. It's not an easy situation at all and people view it in different ways.\n\nThat said. NTA. You didn't make up anything, you told him the truth and told him that he has a right to feel how he feels. From my own point of view I think that when parents don't get along it will only create bad situations for everyone involved. But it's wrong to try and force happiness on a kid. Maybe he will be angry about it forever and he has a right to. Especially with a family like that. Heather sounds insufferable.\n\nReally. You did the right thing. Tell him that he doesn't have to pretend to be happy and that you'll always be there for him. He needs that. And you do too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: But I don't agree with painting divorce as a selfish act done by parents. It's really not.", "NTA you were bring honest, your honesty also stated you were not happy in a blended family,  17 is old enough that you don't have to stay over anymore you can go to court and as for a change to only see your dad out of the home if you wanted", "NAH\n\nIt's true that, if the parents' relationship is bad, it can be a relief for a child to see the parents separate and no longer deal with living in such chaos, day in and day out.\n\nOn the other hand, it is disruptive, and while the parents may feel relief at having their own, separate, homes, it doesn't work out so well for kids.  Either the parents fight out sole custody to one parent, or else the child gets pushed into the life a nomad, shifting between the two parents homes on a schedule that has more to do with the parents' needs than the child's comfort.\n\nIn this situation, what a child wants is often for the parents' relationship to be fixed.  For them to get along again.  To have a peaceful home with both parents there.\n\nSo, three options:\n\n1. parents divorce, child becomes a nomad between two homes.\n2. parents stay together, as is, child lives in a house with constant fighting.\n3. parents stay together, fixing their relationship and creating a peaceful home for the child.\n\n\\#3 is what you, and your cousin, wish could happen.  It is what people envision when they tell parents to \"work it out for the sake of the kids.\"  But it is unlikely to actually happen.  #2 is the most likely scenario if the parents don't divorce.  #1 is, often, somewhat better than #2, but that does not remove the wish for #3. \n\nDiscussing these 3 situations with your much younger cousin may help him understand the situation better.  It may help for you to talk with him about how, while #3 is not possible, he can self-advocate to make #1 work out as well as possible for him.  Help him think about things that will make this situation better for him.  An agreement that each parent must maintain a private bedroom for him, even if they form a new relationship with someone else who has kids?  He gets to choose how he shifts between houses?  Logistics of the custody (which house when, how many days each) to be renegotiated for each school year, to fit with his school schedule and extracurricular activities?\n\nYou're older and have experience living this way.

Also sounds op was catching a lot of flak for telling an 8 yo his feelings are OK and pretty normal and the adults in the situation all sound a little ass holeish.", "Pretty much me. Under the law where I'm from, kids are by default to be under the custody of the mother upon separation (there is no divorce where I'm from) if the kid is under 7 years of age (with the exception of the mother being abusive), otherwise the kid is considered old enough to decide on their own. My parents separated when I was 4 but lived together until I was 6, and they let me decide where I wanted to live with. I remember choosing my mom because my dad would get physically abusive (I had no recollection of this particular incident, but apparently when I was 3, my dad would attempt to hit me in the *head*--with what, I didn't even want to know--and my mom would block the blow and allow herself to be hit instead).\n\nNeedless to say, I chose my mom but boy was I in for a huge plot twist. She met a dude at work and apparently he impregnated her, and I only found out when she was in the hospital *having* my sister, through my great-aunt who served as my stay-in nanny. My great-aunt (who was the BEST by the way) quit as my nanny and left about a week after my sister was born (see, she was my dad's father's sister, and she was pretty shaken by the turn of events, nevermind the fact that my mom didn't even have the balls to tell her son, a.k.a me, that she was pregnant with another man's child). That was just the tip of the iceberg. In '04, shortly after my sister was born, baby daddy moved in, I needed to get used to the fact that I was gonna be a big brother so in step-sperm donor's (my sister hates him as well) words, that meant I wasn't allowed to do anything \"kid\" anymore, even though I was only **seven**. Various nannies came and went starting with another great-aunt (mom's mother's sister) from '04 until about '05. Mostly they care for my sister now and not much for me, but they are pretty much the only parental figures I have at home since mom worked overtime all the time and step-sperm donor, well, just doesn't care. Those nannies end up quitting after only months because they couldn't stand step-sperm donor (but when my first great-aunt, who was taking care of me for three years, quit in '04, mom lied and said she quit because she couldn't handle *me* anymore), so I grew up thinking I was that much of a menace. \n\nIn '05, we had a nanny that I'm particularly fond with and she stayed with us for longer than a few months. A lot longer. She not only became my second mom, she became my friend. Well, things are about to get exciting. Towards the end of '06, we moved towns so that meant I had to say goodbye to my childhood friends who were one of my only rays of light. That also meant I was to switch schools. In '07, the nanny quit after two years, and the one who replaced her was a real bitch. She was 22 years old and didn't have any real patience handling a child, much more a pre-teen. And to top all that off, she smoked cigarettes in our room (I was made to sleep in the same room as the nannies when step-sperm donor moved in) and all that third-hand smoke brought my asthma back in '08 when I was 12. Needless to say, I asked to move to my dad since he was eager to take me back after learning about my situation. That wasn't any better.\n\nWhen I moved back with my dad, I endured zero physical abuse, but then it got to *emotional* abuse, and to me that was worse. I once got three hours of yelling because I got a B average (I used to be a straight A but guess what made my grades drop down) and was compared a lot to my then-stepsister (his then-partner's daughter) who is one year behind me and is a straight A. The following semester, I started getting failing grades. After all, I was never gonna amount to anything higher than my stepsister, right? In '09, after more than a year of trying to raise me solo, my dad called my mom to ask for help with my tuition fees. Having raised me solo for six years, my mom was all \"if you can't handle his expenses, why don't you just return him to me?\" Of course I wasn't gonna agree either, step-sperm donor was still there. In the end, they agreed to splitting my tuition and daily allowances 50-50. And that wasn't a walk in the park, either since my dad was uber difficult with it, especially when I went to college in 2012. I have once again experienced my parents bickering with each other, only that my mom doesn't wanna talk to my dad anymore at all, so all their tirades went through me, and that was *demeaning*.\n\nOf course, by the time their legal separation was finalized in 2015 when I was 19, I have learned the real reason why they separated, and have come to realize that it was all for the best, but given everything I was recollected, looking back I'm not even sure of whether what happened to me is better than what would have happened if my parents stayed married.", "my mum ended up fleeing my dad to stay with a friend and I was stuck living with my dad without my mum until they sorted all of that out. I broke my leg and my dad wouldn't get me crutches, take me to the doctor or made me food. My 17 year old brother with severe ADHD and autism had to make me food, even though he can barely make a meal for himself."]}
