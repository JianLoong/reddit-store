You only talk every few months over the internet. And how long ago was it that you were in school together? Numerous years? He might not have known at first what it all involves, that you need so many private information and that his address and mobile number are not enough. Just the fact you didn't even have his number before shows that you were not really close anymore, too. And I understand why he might feel more comfortable to lie than to tell you that you are too much of a stranger to him to give you all those information. \n\nFeel free to go no contact. It is not like that is a big change to the current situation. Or just accept his excuses and keep up with him, but just be aware that you are not really the friends you were in school anymore. What you asked for was too much from a guy you only talk with online every few months.", "You only catch up every few months and only online. I am often asked to provide references because of my job and I wouldn't be a referee of someone like this either.\n\nThere's a very big gap between 'I know you well enough to vouch for you being who you claim to be' and 'I think you're dodgy enough to not be friends with'. You are in that gap. You're asking for his passport details and he clearly doesn't think enough of your character for that. \n\nYes he should have been upfront but you should never have put someone in that position to start with.

That is too big of an ask for someone who's effectively an acquaintance, not a close friend.\n\nAnd when you ask someone for a favor, you need to disclose all the details.  \"Would you give me a reference for a passport?  It would require you to enroll your passport in the electric verification program if you haven't already.\"\n\nAnd people can absolutely say no when you ask for a favor.  This guy doesn't owe you anything, and it's an asshole move to pressure him about it and to cut him off out of spite.  Although my guess is he won't be heartbroken to no longer hear from you.", "How did you check his details and see he is enrolled?\n\nThat's creepy as fuck man. Find someone else to do it.", "You will not get a reference from him. \n\nHaving recently dealt with this issue I have to ask - how is there no one else in your life you can ask?", "YTA\n\nThere's a big difference between touching base on discord every few months and giving out personal information and personally vouching for someone that you aren't in regular contact with, even if you knew each other in school years ago. \n\nYes, he could have been blunt, but if he can deflect and have you find someone closer to you to act as a reference for you. That would be less disruptive to your casual relationship that explicitly calling out how not close you two actually are.

He is probably incredibly happy you left him on \"read\". Please go no contact with him.\n\nYTA", "YTA. The only person you could think of to give you a reference is someone you only speak to intermittently online? You didn\u2019t even have his phone number already - you had to ask him for it?

Sure, you caught him fibbing but he only told you a fib to politely decline doing you a favour. You failed to read the room, which is probably why you don\u2019t have anyone else you can ask to vouch for you. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t focus on giving this guy a hard time - I\u2019d spend my energy thinking about why I didn\u2019t have anyone else to ask and take steps to rectify that.", "YTA, I would be so uncomfortable doing this fir someone I haven\u2019t seen IRL recently.", "YTA. You sound creepy AF. And entitled. You don\u2019t have anyone else who can be a reference other than an online acquaintance (that\u2019s all this person is at this point)?!\n\nBut I agree you SHOULD go no contact. You basically are already. I\u2019m sure this person wouldn\u2019t mind.", "YTA.\n\nThis is someone you barely keep in touch with \"every few months\", why on earth would you expect him to give you a reference or any of his personal info?\n\nHonestly if you went no contact with him it would probably be a blessing for him.", "YTA.\n\nSomeone would have to be EXTREMELY close to me for me to give out passport info, or go to anything more than very minimal effort to help with this particular issue. Certainly not someone that I only speak to online once in a blue moon and haven't seen in person in years.\n\nYour request was simply much too great for the very loose status of your barely-there connection.\n\nFeel free to go NC.

I wouldn't do it. Ask an actual family friend who sees you all the time. Also, which country are you in that a passport reference requires that? In Canada, where I live, passport referees are required to provide only their address and phone nr.", "YTA and an entitled person too.\n\nWhy can't you ask a relative or a neighbor? A coworker?\n\nWhy ask someone who is so out of your daily life?\n\nYou're weird for doing that.\n\nBut also, none of your friends are obligated to assist you for this. They have better things to do, even if they are just lazing about.", "YTA This sucks for you, but nobody is under any obligation to vouch for anyone. \n\n* \"We catch up over discord once every few months\"\n* \"He seems reluctant at first\"\n\nThat's the reference you want to have for a passport application?

But\u2026 I had a friend do something similar over a passport application. They had some weird electoral thing going where they had a P.O.
