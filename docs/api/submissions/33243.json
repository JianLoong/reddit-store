It has been passed down over the years from grandparents to parents, and for the last several years, to me. The last 3 years, the only people who come to this party are my mom's friends. All of my friends and our other family goes to other places. \n\nEvery year, my mom comes to the party late. I clean my house, prep for this party, buy, cook and prep food for days/hours. She sweeps in 20 minutes late, takes over my house, plays hostess, and has a great time with her friends for the evening. At the end of the night, she goes home with the guests, around midnight. I'm exhausted, and we still have to clean and set the house up for Santa in the morning for the kids. \n\nMy mom cannot have the party at her home because it is not suitable for guests and company. It's currently under remodel, and construction, and has been for some time. \n\nThis year, my grandma will be home, and offered to have the party at her house, but wants it to be her family only- no friends or additional guests. My mom wants me to have the party at my house anyway. My grandmother is extremely difficult (toxic behavior, and insists on white glove clean- no matter what I do it won't be good enough). If she wants to do it, I want to let her and not be bothered.\n\nI told my mom that if she wants me to have the party at my house this year she has to come help me since everyone who comes is her guest. I told her that the party is at 6pm. I want her to come at 2pm (since she's always late, I assume she will come at 4pm), and help. If she does not, I will pack up my family, I will lock the house and I will leave. We will go out to eat and go see a movie or drive around to see Christmas lights. Whatever we have to do to not be home, and there will be no party at all. She was the one who invited everyone to my house, she can explain it to them. AITA for saying that to her?

Make it simpler, though.  \"Mom, this is no longer a family party.  I want a Christmas party surrounded by my family, and that's Grandma's.  I am not throwing a party at my house again.\"\n\nWhy are you bothering to throw a party you don't enjoy, that doesn't have people you like at it, solely for your mother's benefit?", "You WNBTA, but I also don't see why you would. It doesn't sound like you get any joy out of this party, so just say no. Your mom can host it at a hall or she can let your grandmother host and forego seeing her friends. But it sounds a lot of effort and expense on your part with no benefit to you and no appreciation from your mom, so I would just stop. Go to your grandma's, or do something with just your family that you will actually enjoy on Christmas Eve.", "NTA.  Personally I would have shut down her having a party for her friends at your place long ago.  Surely one of her friends should be able to host at their own place.  Your mothers behaviour is unlikely to change so it would be best to call the whole thing off now.", "Def NTA. Your mom is wild for never helping to set up or clean up what is essentially her party. I applaud you for setting a boundary which you have every right to do and you should absolutely stick to it. \n\nI do have a suggestion though that may make it even easier for you and avoid some unnecessary built up conflict. It sounds like no matter what, too much will fall on you even if your mom shows up 2 hours ahead to help. I think if you are still comfortable letting your mom host at your house, I would make it clear to her this is her party and that you and your family will be out for the evening. Fully leave the responsibility to her. If you want to head out with the family for dinner before she gets there to set up then leave her a key under the mat. This way, you still get to graciously provide a place for your moms party which seems like what you\u2019d like to do, while not having to have your boundaries constantly pushed by your mom who clearly likes to take advantage of your kindness.", "NTA, if your mom wants to have a party with her friends, she can host it. If her home isn't suitable, she can rent a space. I have no idea why you are hosting this party. You do all the work so that she and her friends can have a good time? Fuck that noise", "NTA\n\nBut just cancel the party now.  Your Mom can book a restaurant or something for herself and her friends.", "NTA since this is seems like a party for mostly her friends", "Your threat is that you will spend days of your time and money preparing for something that you already half plan to cancel, and that you will cancel the Christmas Eve plans of a lot of innocent people at the last minute. It\u2019s not a sensible use of your own resources, and if you are serious it\u2019s not fair on the guests. \n\nCancel it now. Or insist that your mother does all the prep. Or suffer it again for one last year before insisting that your mother has to do the whole thing at her own home if she wants it to happen again.", "I'd be inclined to say Not the Asshole. \n\n\n\nYou've given her plenty of warning, It costs you money and time, you're dealing with family which makes everything more difficult.\n\n\nbut you've communicated it clearly. You might end up becoming the asshole if you stand by your words and shut up shop on the night and leave people out in the cold.\n\n\nSo a caveat might be to say, that IF she doesnt come and help then this is the last time you'll host it and make that completely clear to any and all guests on the night (IF she doesnt help).\n\n\nTherefore you arent screwing anyone over by leaving them outside, you're communicating a very clear and low bar requirement for your mother, there's no need for hostility within the communication as long as she understands its not an empty threat. \n\n\nIf she does fail and you end up telling people this is the last one you're going to host then she has to deal with the fallout, you wont have to deal with this crap next year; and it gives everyone a years notification that it wont be hosted by you next year.", "YWBTA, for actually having a party at your house for your mom's friends.", "Definitely NTA. This is your mothers party, not your party and not even a family party, and as such your mother needs to be responsible for it. \n\nYou should know that your mother is not going to help so I would just cancel it now, get the aftermath out of the way now, and have a lovely Christmas with your immediate family.", "NTA but it's pretty obvious this is another one of those ridiculouslty lopsided posts that's either fake or fishing for upvotes. You know full well this situation is completely black and white, who on earth is actually going to say you're in the wrong here.", "NTA if mom wants to have the party can\u2019t she rent a space and maybe have some catering?", "NTA. \n\nBUT. Why are you hosting this party at all?  It sounds like it exhausts you and takes up so much time, and gives you very little happiness in return.  That  time could be better spent watching Christmas movies while snuggling on the couch with your kids.  They should be your priority.  Not your mom and her friends.", "WTF is this toxic BS? NTA. WHY would you even do this to begin with? CANCEL.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You ain't the asshole for standing up for yourself and setting some boundaries. If she don't show, shut that party down without any guilt about it. Your grandma can deal with it or put on her big girl pants and invite some other family members over to fill in the empty seats.\n\nAlso grammar is a bitch sometimes but oh well, whatever gets my point across ya know? Just say what's on your mind instead of worrying so much about word order or punctuation.\n\nBeen there before with toxic relatives too. Sometimes walking away from their bullshit is the best solution, even if it means cancelling plans last minute. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for taking care of yourself first mmmkay?", "NTA! That\u2019s a lot on someone who is hosting for someone else\u2019s party and friends. Please update on how she responds and how it turns out", "NTA. If she wants to invite all her friends, she needs to pitch in with the party prep too. Ain't nobody got time for that shit and then have to clean up after everyone else while being tired as hell. You aren't wrong for setting boundaries and standing your ground if she doesn't show up to help.", "NTA. That is an excellent plan!  You might even put up a note on your door when you leave with instructions to call your mother about rescheduling or last minute cancellation.  No apology from you is necessary.  Please update so we know how it turns out.", "I hope you really do this", "NTA sounds like a fine plan.", "INFO: first of all NTA, but what did your mom say when you told her this?", "It sounds like your mother is toxic too. She uses you, you do know that right? NTA and if it were me I would introduce her to a restaurant.", "NTA - my mum always used to throw parties when I visited home from uni or London, she'd invite all her friends and sometimes children, who are my age, would show up, but most of them had moved out like me. Then I'd end up doing all the cooking for 40+ people and she'd take all the credit and expect thanks for \"throwing me\" a party \n\nLooking back, at it after I went to therapy and realised my mum was a narcissist, I realised just how incredibly selfish she was", "You know she\u2019s not showing up early to help, right? And will leave without cleaning up. Don\u2019t give her the option of having the party there without you, you\u2019ll just be left with the mess to clean up. \nJust tell her you\u2019re unable to host and she\u2019ll have to find another venue. But do it now, do she has a week to sort it out and tell people.", "Days of cleaning, shopping, prep work, cooking and baking, and your only condition is that she show up four hours before the party? OP, you\u2019re still getting screwed. Mom needs to be a full partner in vacuuming, meal planning, paying, and helping in the kitchen, period, or no party. She\u2019s treating you like a restaurant with a full staff, showing up just in time to take the credit and leaving at the same time as *her* guests, not even offering to help clean up. You have options to end the entitlement, just pick one.", "You are absolutely NTA, and I'm awed by your ability to set healthy boundaries with your mom. I'm a grown ass adult currently hiding in my bedroom stress eating edibles because I don't have your strength, lol. I salute you, internet stranger, and I wish I had half your moxie.", "NTA, if your mother wants the party, she can host it. As she should have been doing all along.", "She expects you to be the maid service, event space, and catering for her own party. There are legitimate services she can hire for all these things instead of taking advantage of her child's generosity. NTA!", "Wow. This sounds awful, why do you keep hosting this party? It's so much work, and it's not even for your own friends or family.\n\nNTA for your ultimatum, but really, I think a better idea is to just not do it anymore.", "I\u2019m inclined to say you need to get your mother another venue. A little proactively looking for rental halls and find one free option in the area. Tell her hey mom I thought about it, I want to go to grandmas house and I don\u2019t want to hist this year. You want a party great here is a free library room you can reserve, you have fun with your friends, or ask one of them to host. I love you. I am burnt out. This is significantly easier than you relying on her to help because she hasn\u2019t before\nNTA", "YTA for becomeing a grown woman with her own children and still being unable to say 'no' when you need to.", "NTA.\n\nOP, shut up your house, pack your family up and have a GREAT time going to the movies/out to dinner!", "INFO: Why won't your family or friends come to your Christmas party? Why is it only your Mom's friends?\n\nThis is very strange.", "NTA. Follow through. It\u2019s her friends and your family. Why isn\u2019t she hosting it at her house? It ceased being a family party long ago.", "Cancel the party now. No matter what either of you says, neither you nor your mother agree on the party; just call it all off now.", "OP apparently doesn't understand that the word \"no\" can be used with her mother.", "Based on mom's past behavior, I'd be worried OP would come home to a trashed house. Sure she might come early to set up or  perhaps pay a caterer but I doubt she'll stick around to clean it up.", "Based on this post, I would not trust OP's mother to take care of the house if she's being made to host. In fact, I would go as far as to say I think she would use that as an opportunity to get revenge.", "I can't speak for OP, but my mother did everything in her power, from yelling, belittling, and making me feel guilty to get her way.  The only thing I could do was move out of the state, and my mother cut me off and wrote me out of her will.\n\nAs I didn't know when she died, I could not contest her will, and it is all gone."]}
