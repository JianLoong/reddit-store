Thanks to people like your friend and others (emotional peacock, anyone?) the rules have changed so that only service dogs are allowed to fly without fees anymore, and in order for an animal to be a service dog, you have to fill out a DOT attestation form that's filed with the airline.

The problem with adding untrained pets to the mix is that you inconvenience everybody around you, including disrupting legitimate service animals trained to recognise signs of life threatening health conditions. \n\nESA animals are living, breathing pets (albeit with an extra \u2018purpose\u2019), they are certainly not stuffed toys, accessories, or blankets to be taken everywhere one goes, but people love to treat them as such.

I fly with my Chihuahua every trip. Most airlines have a fee and there are carrier requirements. It's very simple and they get their own record locator. They also get marked on your ticket. It is absolutely 100% normal and not \"abuse of the system.\" \n\nKeeping dogs in cargo is actually very stressful and can be downright dangerous for dogs. Frankly I would never fly again if I had to put my dog in cargo. It's no place for a pet. My dog goes in the cabin with me, because luckily she's small enough.\n\nClearly she is not aware that calling her dogs \"ESAs\" has nothing to do with why they're allowed on the plane. Some airlines do require proof of vaccination or other vet records. Others have little to no requirements except for size. Your friend is mistaken and is an AH for attempting to lie about ESAs, but you're a bit of an asshole too for not doing research and assuming no one can bring their dog in-cabin.", "In the USA, emotional support animals are not included in the Americans With Disability Act. They're only recognized in fair housing laws and in transportation laws  I think the transportation laws are just for airlines, but I don't know that for sure. So, people trying to take ESA's everywhere they go is not legally protected."]}
