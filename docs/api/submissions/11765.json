You said you don't judge people, and in the very next sentence described how you judged them.\n\nThat's the definition of judging. You picked the people you *thought* could afford it.

We could even rephrase the sentence as \"I just picked the people I judged could afford to go\" and the sentence has the same meaning.

But you've planned out this big destination wedding and purchased some kind of extremely expensive invitation that for some reason had to be super expensive rather than something simple so everybody could feel included.\n\n Where you chose to cost cut shows a lot about your priorities. Not the destination, not the resort, not whatever gold-plated invites somehow cost so much you felt the need to cut down the first place.
