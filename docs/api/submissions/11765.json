I would say that the OP shouldn't have done what they did but there are better ways to handle it. I have a big family and I don't get along with a chunk of them due to some history of drama but I did let everyone know that it was going to be a small wedding and not everyone was going to be invited. It was hard to approach and I did get some passive aggressiveness from some but they were ones I don't really keep in touch with.", "We toured a venue that wanted $10k for a run down POS pole barn that'd hold maybe 80 people if they liked each other enough.  The building for the ceremony was in even worse condition - take a wrong turn and you'll fall through the floor of the porch that was half missing.  It was like an abandoned house they tried to turn into a church.  Weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen, and someone people thought $10k was a good enough price they were consistently booked up.", "I am a bit baffled - what's wrong if only part of the family participates in a vacation? I'd not think twice if a part of my family decided to go together on a trip - why would I think I should be invited too?", "Eh, you just missed the cut-off! I'll extend you honorary membership.", "Exactly. I think what they did was no worse than people who have a small wedding just because they want a small wedding, but they should have just said it like that. OP doesn\u2019t say they\u2019re at all close to the people they didn\u2019t invite, but everyone on here is acting like they absolutely MUST invite EVERYONE. I\u2019m sorry, but if I\u2019ve not seen cousin Jane in 15 years and she\u2019s never been anything other than rude to me, then she\u2019s not obligated to an invite no matter the wedding style. Everyone has a cousin Jane (Aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, whatever), and it always causes a huge fuss no matter what you do with them.", "You *couldn't afford* to send extra invitations to people that *you assumed could not afford* to waste money on your destination wedding?

JFC, if you're so broke that you can't afford a few extra invites, then you have no business having a destination wedding.", "I live in Canada and most of my relatives live in South Africa, where I'm originally from. When I got married I knew my favourite aunt wouldn't be coming. She didn't have a lot of money and she hated flying. But I sent her an invitation anyway - not because I expected her to suddenly be able to come, but to show her that she was an important part of my life. When she died a year later, we found the invitation in her box of favourite things.", "This was my thought too.  My car is older, I don't go out a lot, do a lot of shopping, or get my hair and nails done.  I'd much rather have a good chunk of money in the bank to use on my sister's destination wedding.", "I can't get over the fact that she wants an expensive destination wedding and chooses expensive invitations, but wants to save on the invitations too? Just pick a cheaper option, no one's gonna judge you. Not inviting half the family and perhaps also half your friends? Yeah, you're gonna be judged, and not in a good way.", "Eh. I care more about the people in my life than where. Take the dress and tux on the honeymoon for those beach wedding vibes. Don\u2019t exclude loved ones from the big event because you care more about a big to-do event than the people you love.", "I think a lot of us have long time friends like that.

Just a bridal suite for me with an outdoor space attached for both the ceremony and reception. That was the absolute cheapest possible option that wasn't the courthouse. Not that OP wasn't rude or in the wrong for parts of this, but people on here hating on them for not inviting each and every person they know are a bit out of touch. Mine and my husbands family live 2000 miles apart, EVERY venue was a destination wedding no matter what we chose. Having a party with only 20 people would have been the only way to save money, but it would have absolutely pissed off almost all of them as well, and been unforgiveable according to some of the logic on here.", "Wow, YTA, you invite people and let them make their own choice  on budget.  You did judge them and unless you have access to their bank accounts you have no real idea if they can afford to go or not.", "It's the same as the, I am not racist, but....", "It\u2019s because destination weddings are cheaper. It passes the cost off the couple onto the guests who have to travel.

They didn't feel like stressing everyone about their destination wedding.", "For real. \n\nWanting to save on invitations means not going with expensive ones; doesn't mean invite fewer people. \n\nCraziness.\n\nWe paid for our wedding ourselves and didn't want unnecessary expenses so we could splurge a bit on the important things.

Neither of us wanted to do the massive event wedding. \n\nWe offered a 40% discount for room booking and of course are paying for the food. It's interesting that you think you are entitled to getting an all expenses paid trip simply because you are invited to the wedding. No one is forcing you to go, for one. Second...it's not about you!

Camping!", "Why is it hard to understand that what you want for yourself personally doesn't equal a rule for everyone? Its great that those are your priorities, and that is how you should plan and handle your wedding. For someone else the where might be really important. You are putting your own personal feelings of a big to do over loved ones and its not the same thought process for everyone. And its their wedding. There is no wrong choice for what your own priority is.", "Not really, especially with all the cancelled weddings due to COVID and food being so expensive. I was planning my wedding for 2020 and it was about 60k for 250 people. Whole thing was cancelled due to COVID and we eloped, but started looking around a few months ago to do a 2.0 wedding. 60k barely gets 100 people now. \n\nGuest list trimming is pretty much the only way to do it unless you scale down everything you want.", "It makes sense because resorts offer huge discounts on the venue to the couple if they have a certain amount of paying guests. \n\n\nAnd duh.", "I just came back from watching that video. You must go watch the video to understand these invitations, Lmao.", "Mine too. She economized on the wrong thing. Instead of saving money on how many invites, she should have chosen less expensive invites.", "Why is it that hard to understand that OP conducted herself very poorly?? Anyone who find the Where of a single day of their life more important than the Who gets to be with them is pretty selfish unless all the Who they want to be there can actually afford to freaking be there. Why is it so hard to understand rhat putting a where above a who when you can take the where for the honeymoon is just flat out selfish?

My coworkers niece got married in Costa Rica and because the resort wedding was all inclusive, it was cheaper than a lot of \u201caffordable venues\u201d around our area, especially once you add in food, decor, fees for chairs and tables, required insurance, and other vendors. Also worth noting that my coworker would be perceived as \u201cpoor\u201d by most standards (including mine as a child of pretty extreme poverty and still living paycheck to paycheck today), but still managed to make attending the wedding work and was actually really excited because the discounts you get as a guest of a destination wedding mean that \u201cvacation\u201d is cheaper than it would have been otherwise.", "People who don't travel often have no need to buy luggage if they can borrow it.

Clearly costs for everything are up and we probably couldn\u2019t do it again for that price now. (Not that I want to, my favorite thing about wedding is that it\u2019s over!)\n\nBut with the economy in the shape it\u2019s in now, how are normal people pulling off a 30k wedding? That\u2019s a down payment on a house!", "And the poorer person maybe would have travel gear for short trips they could afford", "Exactly. One of my closest friends threw a $5k wedding in 2017, but it was held at her MIL's house, she didn't have a real dress, she did literally everything herself, and the few people that needed to travel, like me, either stayed at the teeny country hotel down the street for dirt cheap or at her MIL's house. I had my wedding in 2021 and spent double that doing almost exactly what she did because the only differences were that I don't have a huge yard to use for free, and way more of my family needed to travel. I don't think it's unreasonable to want to have a small, or even destination, wedding and yet all the comments make it sound like it's totally out of the question. OP was rude in the way they handled telling people it was a small destination wedding, but it's not rude to keep it small or do it away (some HAVE to do it away). That only becomes rude if you throw a fit that the people didn't come or send a gift to your out the way event.", "Or BIL was your in-laws scapegoat to avoid blame for not inviting you themselves."]}
