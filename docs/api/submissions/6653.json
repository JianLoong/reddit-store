Her statements shook me, as if she completely disregarded everything she knew about me to try to control who I was. I went LC with her following college and ended up finding a wife who fit the narrow type of women I would date.\n\nFast forward to last March. Mom was diagnosed with cancer and reached out to me.

This involved reconnecting with me, and we did, including going whitewater rafting together. She passed a few days before Christmas. Here\u2019s the issue: Two days before she went, she apologized for the first time for trying to tell me what I should be attracted to, recognizing that she\u2019d hurt me. I told her that though I enjoyed reconnecting with her and moving forward, I couldn\u2019t forgive her for the pain she\u2019d caused me by trying to verbally beat me into being who she wanted me to be instead of embracing me for who I am. I said the apology was too little, too late.\n\nMy dad, who was also in the hospital room (my parents weren\u2019t on the greatest of terms, but he wanted to say goodbye), told me after that was unnecessarily cruel and that I should have said I forgive her because it\u2019s not like she\u2019d know the difference. He\u2019s not speaking to me, nor is my stepmom. My sister agrees with my dad but is still talking to me since she understands where I\u2019m coming from, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make it okay.\u201d I only had a hollow Christmas with my in-laws, and this morning my half-brother reached out to ask if I\u2019m ready to apologize to Dad.

It shouldn\u2019t ever be forced. \n\nYou reconnected and spent time with her which I\u2019m sure was incredibly heartwarming for the both of you but true forgiveness takes time.

It was none of his business and I think he should be apologizing to you for telling you off. You are NTA and I'm sorry for your loss.", "A lot of people misunderstand the concept of forgiveness. Forgiveness is really about yourself and not the person who harmed you. The harm creates negative feelings that are a burden that you carry with you. When you forgive the person, you are releasing that burden. \n\nSo really, you do need to forgive her, even now. And I don\u2019t see the point of reconnecting with her if you were going to stick the knife in her like that. You would\u2019ve been better off remaining estranged.

She absolved herself of being an asshole in this conversation. You don't have to forgive her, but it sounds like you only didn't because you enjoyed being a petty asshole.", "NTA. I don't understand these people who think forgiveness on demand is a thing. Your mother sprang this on you at the last minute, right? Her apologizing is good, but wanting your forgiveness as well sounds like those Catholics who live a life of \"sin\" because they will confess those sins at the end and Last Rites will clear their way to heaven. Good luck with that.\n\nThe fact is, you didn't forgive her. And there's nothing wrong with that. Why *should* you lie? And why should you apologize to your dad?

She told me to settle for a bottom-of-the-barrel mate to be happy, which defies all logic. So to be happy, I should have a mate who makes me miserable? The fuck? I no longer discuss my life with her, and if she does it again, she gets cut off completely.\n\nOP was right to cut her off. His mom was wrong to wait so long. If she\u2019d have apologized when they reconnected, as opposed to saving it for her final days, OP would\u2019ve had more time to process it. He might\u2019ve forgiven her if she hadn\u2019t dumped him on it last minute and tried to guilt him into it because she was dying.

I hope you understand that.", "I can think of a couple of examples off the top of my head.\n\n1.  A patient dies a horrible death but the doctor tells next of kin that he didn\u2019t suffer. Same for a homicide detective to relatives of a murder victim. \n\n2.  Telling someone on her deathbed something kind to make her feel good doesn\u2019t hurt anyone.\n\n3.  Telling someone you enjoyed their cooking is an act of kindness, especially if it\u2019s someone you\u2019re not going to see very often.  if it\u2019s your wife, it\u2019s better to be honest so that you don\u2019t have continued awkward situations.", "The fact that you found a way to pull \"narcissistic\" from any of this makes the rest of what you said meaningless to me. \n\nMy father literally raped me as a child and my birth mother is a heroine addict but yeah tell me how I'm a narcissist ass for choosing to say fuck them I'd rather take care of me \ud83d\ude44", "Having emotions doesn't make you an ass. Expressing those emotions safely doesn't make you an ass. Telling the truth doesn't make you an ass. You know what makes you an ass, talking about how someone copes and feels their emotions as \"inappropriate behavior\". There was no inappropriate behavior. Some people don't like showing emotions. Some people don't lie. Neither of those things are inappropriate. Inappropriate is touching someone without consent or talking about intimate subjects. And the \"inappropriate behaviors\" your talking about aren't just autistic behaviors. Plenty of NT people don't show emotion or lie. The behaviors you're talking about don't need a pass because they are completely acceptable and actually pretty common in ND AND NT people", "In this conflict, Mom is not the asshole. That is what I was talking about. I was justifying the YTA over an ESH. I'm not going into anything further with you.", "The fact that it would be a lie is what makes OP an AH.  To not give forgiveness to someone who genuinely asks for it is evil.", "So autistic people are stupid?  Is that what you\u2019re saying?

Bro you think a doctor or the police lying isn't bad wtf! 2. You must not be a good person. I still feel bad about lying about chocolate cake as a child, I'd feel absolutely HORRIBLE if I LIED to someone especially if they were dying. 3. I'd rather not let someone think they are good at something. That's heartbreaking. \"Oh this food is so good.\" Then you make the same thing when you have different guest. \"This isn't very good.\" They know you lied. Lying actually makes me feel bad. I just thought that that was a human thing but I guess not... Some people enjoy lying apparently and to the ones they love, so very sad", "What does your personal situation have to do with the OPs post again?  Oh right, nothing.  You\u2019re trying to give a pass to a-hole behavior under the guise of \u201cautistic people can\u2019t do that\u201d.

Dad wants an apology because he witnessed a private moment between his ex and their child.", "You assume it's genuine. I'm a good liar. I could probably faked that apology and I've only had 18 years of experience and I HATE lying. This woman practically abused her CHILD. She had 29 years before she died to apologize but only did it a couple days before she died. It wasn't genuine, she wanted forgiveness so she waited until most people would lie to make her feel better. A genuine apology doesn't happen on someone's deathbed. That's bullshit.", "Ah so neurotypical of you. It's not stupidity. OP knows their mum was saying sorry the whole time they were reconnecting. \n\nThe real asshole is the dad who's made it all about him in some twisted unresolved grief in his failed relationship.", "Autistic people are less likely to hide their real feelings. They are more authentic. Not stupid. And surprise surprise most people don't like lying and that includes autistic people. I'd say the same thing OP did and I'm not Autistic. Also there are older autistic people who don't get social cues. It's all different, everyone is different. I'd also like to point out stupid people can do everything you listed too", "Sounds like you have some unresolved childhood issues, so I\u2019m going to agree to disagree. Take care.", "No, OP merely pointed out that an apology doesn't make the past better. That's all. \n\nYou seem to be projecting here. Dissing austistic people's experiences and calling them narcissistic is pretty assholish behaviour.", "You clearly have something else going on right now.

Hopefully they see the lies you tell them because apparently lying is good", "I\u2019m basing my opinion not on whether or not OP is autistic, but on their ACTIONS.

I couldn\u2019t possibly care less about any diagnosis anyone in this post (OP, commenters, etc.) has.  NONE of it excuses the OPs BEHAVIOR.  I\u2019m not the only one to say so, either.  What\u2019s negative is using your diagnosis of autism to then excuse a-hole behavior.  It might EXPLAIN behavior, but it doesn\u2019t excuse it or make it right.", "Hit a nerve?", "It's sad you believe that.

Sure, I'll agree that it probably should have happened sooner, but that wouldn't make it any less genuine.  It's more sad that you believe that there's a statute of limitations on being sorry.
