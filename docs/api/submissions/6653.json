I told her that though I enjoyed reconnecting with her and moving forward, I couldn\u2019t forgive her for the pain she\u2019d caused me by trying to verbally beat me into being who she wanted me to be instead of embracing me for who I am.

It shouldn\u2019t ever be forced. \n\nYou reconnected and spent time with her which I\u2019m sure was incredibly heartwarming for the both of you but true forgiveness takes time.

It was none of his business and I think he should be apologizing to you for telling you off. You are NTA and I'm sorry for your loss.", "A lot of people misunderstand the concept of forgiveness. Forgiveness is really about yourself and not the person who harmed you. The harm creates negative feelings that are a burden that you carry with you. When you forgive the person, you are releasing that burden. \n\nSo really, you do need to forgive her, even now. And I don\u2019t see the point of reconnecting with her if you were going to stick the knife in her like that. You would\u2019ve been better off remaining estranged.

She absolved herself of being an asshole in this conversation. You don't have to forgive her, but it sounds like you only didn't because you enjoyed being a petty asshole.", "NTA. I don't understand these people who think forgiveness on demand is a thing. Your mother sprang this on you at the last minute, right? Her apologizing is good, but wanting your forgiveness as well sounds like those Catholics who live a life of \"sin\" because they will confess those sins at the end and Last Rites will clear their way to heaven. Good luck with that.\n\nThe fact is, you didn't forgive her. And there's nothing wrong with that. Why *should* you lie? And why should you apologize to your dad?

She told me to settle for a bottom-of-the-barrel mate to be happy, which defies all logic. So to be happy, I should have a mate who makes me miserable? The fuck? I no longer discuss my life with her, and if she does it again, she gets cut off completely.\n\nOP was right to cut her off. His mom was wrong to wait so long. If she\u2019d have apologized when they reconnected, as opposed to saving it for her final days, OP would\u2019ve had more time to process it. He might\u2019ve forgiven her if she hadn\u2019t dumped him on it last minute and tried to guilt him into it because she was dying.

Asshole would not cut it.\n\nFor me personally? What you described her saying would be forgivable assuming she was an otherwise good-enough parent. I say this as someone who experienced what I consider unforgivable cruelty at the hands of my own parents, who did countless things I will never, ever forgive them for, not even on their dying day with all the pleas they can muster. I also say this as a gay person who experienced a lot of homophobia from my parents. Homophobia on the level you described would not be unforgivable in my book, and to be perfectly honest, just about all of my LGBTQ+ friends would agree. The autism-related ignorance I cannot comment on, only say that if similar remarks were made about core parts of who I am, including extremely personal often-discriminated-against attributes of mine, I would not consider them unforgivable either.

They could very well be colossal assholes who don\u2019t understand your pain and are sick with grief, but at the same time... That level of intense anger from so many people is concerning because it means that your entire family truly believes you overreacted and were cruel, and they presumably know you very well. Even your wife was urging you to reconnect, implying she may not fully agree with the degree of resentment you harbour either. That\u2019s not a good sign, and it leads me on to the most delicate point.\n\nSpeaking from experience with family members and friends on the spectrum, alexithymia and self-centered thinking are common symptoms of autism, as I\u2019m sure you know, and sometimes these traits combine in ways that can really, really hurt others. They can cause people to harbour abnormally intense grudges that many would consider excessive, a type of anger rumination. I have seen this happen before, and it can be pretty difficult to watch. In the most respectful and least patronising way, I worry you may not have fully understood the true extent of your mother\u2019s suffering and regret in that moment, and also remained rigid and unyielding for reasons other than it being deserved. She was dying a horrific death I would only wish on my worst enemies, and was trying to atone for things she said out of ignorance many years ago, and it looks like others would not have done what you did in that moment, especially if what you listed were really the worst mistakes she made. Reddit doesn\u2019t like to hear this, but parents aren\u2019t perfect and they say ignorant, stupid shit sometimes, and as long as they love you, are really trying their best, try to correct it, and sincerely apologise, you can\u2019t really ask for more.\n\nSo, NTA, you don\u2019t owe her forgiveness, but I damn well hope your actions were proportional.", "WOW you are the male version of me! I had the same things happen to me, mom, disability and being bi so I feel you! You are NTA, you have every right to feel want you feel and NO ONE has the right to tell you how to feel. Just because someone is dying does not mean they deserve to be forgiven. Your Dad is placing your mom on a pedestal and is expecting you to do the same so because you're not he might believe you are brushing his feelings to the side or he has some resentment towards her and when you didn't forgiven her and he did he feels he is lesser. Go to grief therapy and see if your dad will go as well. You both need time to heal in your own way. I also suggest writing your mom a letter about anything and don't anyone read this is from you to her, get ALL your pain out and then burn it.

It's too personal for Reddit. \n\nAs for the other survivors, give them a little space to grieve, and then express that part of your healing was needing to be honest with her, so that you could move past the trauma.

I'm sorry for OP that they're going to have to wrestle with what they said, someday. I also understand the place of deep hurt they are coming from to have said it in the first place. NAH, just hurt people.", "You make a really good point that the family doesn\u2019t owe OP forgiveness for his actions. He will definitely have to deal with the fall out now. I think this whole situation is very unfortunate.", "Yes, I\u2019m sure she felt peace. The mother didn\u2019t deserve forgiveness, her dying doesn\u2019t change anything.", "Lol no, some people never deserve forgiveness.", "I read this same quote recently on a post about food, great quote to use here btw", "I don't intend to be asking for forgiveness on my deathbed.", "Of course I'd forgive someone who cut off my foot and sincerely apologised on their death bed. Forgiveness isn't about magically erasing the past but moving beyond it.", "This sub literally exists for judgement.  Perhaps you got lost on the way to \"Am I The Person Who Is Entitled to Their Feelings and Is Just Here for Hugs and Not Criticism.\"\n\nThis isn't even one of the more unambiguous situations, there's legitimately no really good answer here.", "Fair is fair.  Be judged by the stick you measure others, just don't change your mind last minute when you are weak, sick and afraid.", "Half of AITA are just here to revel in someone else getting to say/do things they would never want to face the consequences for themselves.\n\nCase in point, the many, many \"X wore an inappropriate dress to my wedding\" threads where tons of people go \"throw a glass of wine on her, that'll show her who's boss.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the thread right now of someone who got a glass of wine thrown on her for her dress gets tons of \"How dare they do such a thing, never speak to them again.\"\n\nCause and effect is meaningless here.", "Lol no, the mother deserved every pain inflicted on her by Op\u2019s words (if she even felt any in the first place) and should\u2019ve reflected on what all she did her entire left in her last moments.", "Oh I agree. I certainly don't want to be lied to on my deathbed, just to spare my feelings."]}
