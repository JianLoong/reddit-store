Of course you want to celebrate with your girlfriend. More the merrier on a night like New Years Eve. The only reason your friend has to be acting like this is that she wants more from you. A kiss at midnight, perhaps? Tell her your girlfriend is non-negotiable, and if that doesn't work for her, you'll find something else to do. Stop giving her all the power. It sounds like she's done this before, and it's weird.", "INFO: how long is she your girlfriend? Someone mentioned: \"It goes without saying that partners spend NYE together.\" I agree. Unless it's really fresh. Like less than a month or something?\n\nAlso, is this friend who objects single? Could she have a crush on you?

He even offered his home for the party.", "Yeah that seems to be the case. Seems so toxic", "I would like to know this too. Along with is this a party or just the 3 of your were getting together?", "I have been dating my girlfriend for a month now, been talking for like 3 months.

In few instances where I expressed some discomfort, it was about girls being obsessed with 2 my exes, all not respecting *any* set boundary (not even set by me but by my exes). My exes dismissed that behaviour of these girls... \n\nIt could very well be jealousy - but there could be something else going on that you may not know about or don't see. Best way to find out what her problem is is just ask her.", "Girls sometimes get possessive of their male friends because they see them as \"back up\" love interests or perhaps that a gf would be threatened by their bf having a female friend. Regardless, her behavior is childish and not your problem.", "Yes, I asked first if it was ok. I wasn\u2019t gonna invite her until she suggested it and I asked my female friend if it was acceptable. She didn\u2019t give me a firm answer yes or no and I finally told her I need an answer because I thought it was gonna be ok.

Have your friends already met her? If your friend might be an introvert then I can get her perspective of not meeting someone new on a holiday.\n\nIn my opinion, you do not sound very mature.

If your friendship with this person is ruined by this, then it needed to be ruined. Her behavior is extremely childish.

And that\u2019s what she was afraid of this time.\" So don't do it again? Like I'm legitimately baffled by this. Yes it ruined her friendship with this person, and it should have. She shouldn't have done it then and it's disturbing that she didn't learn a lesson from it. It's like she's trying to create some sort of artificial barrier of exclusivity around the relationship and there's just no place for that nonsense.", "NTA Why do you think this is your fault.

She has admitted to not letting other people bring their partners simply because she doesn\u2019t want them to. Then admits it caused an issue because she\u2019s trying to gate keep the group.

I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she's just uncomfortable because it takes her a while to warm up to new people. But the only way to warm up to new people is to expose yourself to them. \n\nBut it's also common for some girls to be weird about being the only girl in a group.

Comments about how she's \"just another one of the guys\"?", "NTA but sounds like she's into you.", "NTA\n\nIt is clear that y'all don't know how to throw a party.

I did ask my friends beforehand if it was acceptable. My one friend is an introvert, but so are all of us, and my other friend said yes it was fine.

But then I offered to have it at my apartment and she told me \u201cidk man, it\u2019s up to you\u201d and I said it\u2019s fine with me then she never said anything else and won\u2019t answer me. Now I hear she\u2019s mad at me. But I didn\u2019t yell at her, I did not say she had to come, I simply asked if my girlfriend could come. She wouldn\u2019t want to meet her either so I had to decide to just spend new years with my girlfriend.", "Right?

Generally speaking, *normally* unless there is some conflict (person is an ex to someone at the party) or they are known to cause some drama it shouldn't even be an issue to bring someone to a party along with you unless explicitly told it's a kickback limited **only** to the friend group.\n\nHow do you think people met each other back in the day? Do you ever wonder that this is why younger generations are in such an epidemic of loneliness, because you are so scared of anybody being around you or your personal space that you end up hanging out with the same 3 people for the rest of your life?\n\nThis is not generally an issue at all for mature adult friend groups.", "How old/life experienced are you? Because this is the wrong response. There are social norms. Spending NYE with your new love interest is automatic.

I\u2019d like her to join us but if that\u2019s not okay then we\u2019ll do our own thing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no asking and the options are presented. \n\nClearly the friend-girl either has feelings for OP or she\u2019s asocial and doesn\u2019t like new people to mix. OP has to decide how he wants to move forward but by no means is he an asshole.", "We\u2019re all 24", "Thanks for the info! \nYeah it's an edge case, that month. Three friends is very intimate. But I really don't think you can expect someone to exclude their partner. And I still think the friend may have a crush. She's overreacting in any case. She should be able to explain why she doesn't want the new girlfriend around. The only thing OP mentioned (previous experience with bringing a fourth person) is a pretty lame excuse.", "Your friend communicated badly, but you knew she was uncomfortable. Instead of talking about this, you decided that your girlfriend is also invited, but then at your place, and not at your friends place.\n\nIf your girlfriend and friend had to meet in between Christmas and New Year, then I understand that that is not possible.
