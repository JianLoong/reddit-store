It\u2019s a New Year\u2019s Eve party. It goes without saying that couples spend it together. \n\nShe\u2019s putting a wedge in place for no reason other than her wedge worked in the past. It\u2019s a her problem. Not yours. \n\nIf she wants to be cold and distant because you have a partner that\u2019s on her. Not you or her partner. \n\nGood riddance. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s also a friend but unless she has an issue with your girlfriend their is no reason to expect or ask that you come alone.", "INFO: Does your female friend have a romantic interest in you?", "NTA- BIG red flag. Does she have feelings for you? Because that is what it comes across as. That and if she can't accept new people then sounds like someone I don't want to be friends with. Her reason is super sketchy too. Spend the night with your girlfriend and find some new friends.", "YTA\n\nBased on the word use in post and in the clarification of why you may be the AH, it *seems* you invited your GF without actually making sure people were on board. That's AH territory. You're not hosting, or you wouldn't have suggested to host as a compromise.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like your pushing your GF on your friends event and whining \"it isn't fair\" to get your way. What isn't fair? It's not your party.", "Oh your friend is \ud83d\udea9\n\nWhat they been like with past relationships", "NTA. She wants to be the only girl.

Of course you want to celebrate with your girlfriend. More the merrier on a night like New Years Eve. The only reason your friend has to be acting like this is that she wants more from you. A kiss at midnight, perhaps? Tell her your girlfriend is non-negotiable, and if that doesn't work for her, you'll find something else to do. Stop giving her all the power. It sounds like she's done this before, and it's weird.", "INFO: how long is she your girlfriend? Someone mentioned: \"It goes without saying that partners spend NYE together.\" I agree. Unless it's really fresh. Like less than a month or something?\n\nAlso, is this friend who objects single? Could she have a crush on you? Would she be the only single person if you brought your girlfriend?\n\nAnd how big is this group you're celebrating with?", "INFO\n\nWho is hosting the event?", "INFO: how long have you had these plans with your friends?\n\nAnd what were the plans, exactly?\n\nWere you going to a large party, to hang out with many people, (so one extra person makes little difference) or were the plans originally just the 3 of you hanging out & catching up?\n\nBecause if it\u2019s the second option, then adding a last minute person to a group of 3 will MASSIVELY change the event, and if you\u2019re willing to do that & not think it\u2019s wrong, you\u2019ll probably also spend the entire evening hanging out with your girlfriend & ignoring your other 2 friends, which means\u2026\n\n\u2026you\u2019ve effectively cancelled the new years plans that your friends had, and left them with nothing. Only a couple of days before NYE\u2026!\n\nIs that what you did?\n\nIs that how your friends would describe what you did?", "Exactly. She\u2019s making herself the issue. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any romantic intention but it\u2019s not even a party, just three friends hanging out on new years and my girlfriend wants to join us cuz I\u2019m there", "I really can\u2019t tell what her feelings are, but she has acted like this with our male friend too and it just got super awkward. She eventually warmed up to his friends but I offered my apartment to have the get together so if the house was the problem, I don\u2019t get what the problem is now. I told her new years is important to my girlfriend so I feel like I need to go it solo this new years with my gf", "It sounds like he asked if it was ok first, I\u2019d say Nta.   He even offered his home for the party.", "Yeah that seems to be the case. Seems so toxic", "I would like to know this too. Along with is this a party or just the 3 of your were getting together?", "I have been dating my girlfriend for a month now, been talking for like 3 months. I told my friend about her and she got all awkward. New years did not have a firm plan, it was going to be the three of us and I asked if my girlfriend could come along. Since I got no compromise I figured the only thing I could do was say I couldn\u2019t make it to new years", "It\u2019s not a firm plan, we never even talked about having it at my friend\u2019s house, it just sometimes goes there and she mentioned just wanting to drive around and hang out somewhere. I even offered to host the get together if it was a problem", "OP says the new years plans were never a set in stone thing in other comments and there were no official plans", "Bro just ask your other friend if they wanna hang out at yours instead, he\u2019s also welcome to bring his friend or whoever, she\u2019s not the leader and she\u2019s being weird like why just 3 when u could me more, it\u2019s literally NYE", "This is when you step up. How important is your GF to you? If this is going to be an issue make new plans with the gf.", "Sounds like she enjoys being the only girl in the group. That's gross behavior. Don't be friends with women like that.", ">I really can\u2019t tell what her feelings are\n\nAsk her. \n\nI was labeled the \"controlling gf\" before because I expressed my discomfort with some people, when in reality not only did I not control anything, but I think my reasons weren't that invalid. In few instances where I expressed some discomfort, it was about girls being obsessed with 2 my exes, all not respecting *any* set boundary (not even set by me but by my exes). My exes dismissed that behaviour of these girls... \n\nIt could very well be jealousy - but there could be something else going on that you may not know about or don't see. Best way to find out what her problem is is just ask her.", "Girls sometimes get possessive of their male friends because they see them as \"back up\" love interests or perhaps that a gf would be threatened by their bf having a female friend. Regardless, her behavior is childish and not your problem.", "Yes, I asked first if it was ok. I wasn\u2019t gonna invite her until she suggested it and I asked my female friend if it was acceptable. She didn\u2019t give me a firm answer yes or no and I finally told her I need an answer because I thought it was gonna be ok. We weren\u2019t even gonna have it at my friends house, but I offered my apartment if that was the problem and she didn\u2019t compromise at all."]}
