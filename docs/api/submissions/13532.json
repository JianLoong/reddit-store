Brother was my best friend as a kid and we definitely dealt with some bullshit from each other's admirers.

What a creep.", "NTA. What a slimy creep.", "NTA. Even though nearly all my half/step siblings are disowned I would be pissed if they insisted I was dating any of them. Good that you yelled at him. He deserves it.", "NTA you're also 100% correct. I think he's been watching too much pornography and can no longer tell how real humans think and behave in the real world.", "You mean to tell me finally there's a guy that stands up to creepy guys, and damn it, they're gay.
