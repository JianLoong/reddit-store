At the time they spoke about her adopting the four of us. I said no. There was some debate between them and they decided to hold off until she could adopt all four of us. She was still new to me so I found it incredibly weird to have someone offer to adopt me 5 months after I met them and especially when she and my dad were both aware that I remembered mom.\n\nNone of my siblings have ever called our stepmom \"mom\". Thea and Dex call her by a nickname and Calia calls her by her name like me. But my siblings consider her a parent while I consider her more my dad's wife.\n\nThe adoption topic never really went away and a couple of years ago I did some research and learned that adoption would alter my birth certificate and I would be issued with a new one if I agreed. My stepmom's name would replace my mom's name as my mother. I did a lot of research on the topic because I knew the issue would reach a boiling point eventually. I even got to web chat with a local lawyer who knew the details of that stuff.\n\nA couple of months ago my siblings asked me why I mentioned downsides to being adopted and I told them stepmom's name would replace mom's on our birth certificates and I did not want her to replace mom on mine. I showed them what I found. Calia understood and Thea and Dex got it when we put it into more kid friendly terms.\n\nMy dad and stepmom brought up the adoption again last week and dad said it would be the last time or they would proceed with her adopting my siblings. I said my answer remained no and gave them a very detailed speech on why. My stepmom said I could always frame my original birth certificate if that would make it better and people would see it but I would still be adopted and be her son.

My dad and stepmom tried to coax them out of their no but they all said they didn't want it and Calia said they only ever said yes because they felt like they should, not because they really wanted to be adopted.\n\nMy dad was furious with me and said it was all my fault and I had made them change their minds.

He is not considering the security their birth certificate with their actual mother\u2019s name on it provides to them. Stepmom needs to learn to respect Mom\u2019s position.  If she lets this ruin her relationships with them, she is petty and immature.  \n\nI come at this from 2 view points:\n1) I am an adoptee who did not have a say in whether my birth certificate was altered.  I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone, and feel protective of any child who is feeling pressured to do so. \n2) I am a mother of teens. If I died and my children didn\u2019t want to erase me from their birth certificate, I would be honored and thankful. There is nothing wrong with your desire to keep your legal identity and historical record accurate and consistent.\n\nStand strong, sweetie! I am so sorry your father is handling this so poorly.

It didn't. I didn't know it changed the birth certificate until I needed it when I first got married.

He can set up a large life insurance policy, draft up legal documents to provide a trustee and have that policy money go into a trust to care for you all.

It would mean for example that if a grandparent had made a will stating that a portion of their money was to be divided among grandchildren might not know that this could exclude the person adopted out of their family.

It erases your birth parents existence basically. I hate that we do that in all adoption circumstances. \n\nA college friend of mine had her second husband adopt her daughter with her husband who passed from cancer and internally it destroyed me.

Having your step mom have legal say in their lives is a safety net in case the worst should happen to your dad.

If your dad (this is sad but ... it is what it is) dies. Where would you and your siblings go? If they are adopted by stepmom- there is no question. Maybe stepmother takes yall in... maybe not. There are also inheritance and life insurance things to. The security aspect is important. \n\nBut also- do what you want. Being adopted is also part of the choice. Adoption is a two way street at yalls ages. Just make sure your stepmother knows you do appreciate her and what she does for your siblings. Sounds like she is a decent stepmother at least. Be grateful for that for sure.", "Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be voted NTA. Reddit hates step parents.", "NTA \nBut there might be some very good reasons why adoption is important to her. Depending on where you live, it can be difficult for her to e.g. travel with your siblings, getting information from the school, getting medical information etc. if she is not a legal parent.\nBut most important:\nIf your father divorces her, she would likely have no custody rights at all.\nHe could leave her tomorrow, take the kids and refuses her to ever see them again.\n\nI know several women being in this is situation. One have known the kids since they were 2 years old, love them either all her heart , but she cannot leave her husband because she would loose all contact with the kids (the mom is alive). This gives their marriage a toxic dynamic.\n\nI had a colleague who had to stay with her slightly abusive boyfriend, because of his daughter. The mother had passed away when she was an infant, my colleague had been the only mother figure she knew, but when she was around 10 year old the father got anger issues.

You dad and stepmom know this, that is why they ask you and talk with you. And it only is a choice, if it is OK to say no. It is okay to say no!\n\nI think you made a mistake. I believe remembering the dead is only good, if it helps the living. Yes, it helps you and your siblings to remember your mom. And it helps you to remember her, by her name written as your mother on your birth certificate. I understand it. The memory of her fades and this is painful, but the document tells it is the truth and you don't want to lose this truth. But now this remembrance also hurts you. Your stepmom wants to care for your and your siblings, even in case your dad can't care for you anymore. The adoption could be a very important part in the life of your siblings, as it marks a new beginning. I understand why you feel this way.

Framing that certificate may be a good starting point (maybe use a copy and keep the original away from sunlight), it already is important to you now. But also do something together with you siblings. Maybe ask your dad what her favorite food was and then all of you cook it together. Don't forget to put a plate down for her! Or you watch her favorite movie together. Ask you dad about some stories of her. Give her some place in your new life, other than a name on a document.

Just something to to consider.", "Eh, I get you not wanting it, but you have to consider what the younger ones would want. There's so many factors to all this, it's not easy for you at 16 to even grasp. Adoption isn't taking your real mom away in this scenario.

Just be kind, she maybe your Dad\u2019s wife but she cares for you and has raised your siblings as her own children. She does love you all even if she isn\u2019t your mother. It\u2019s ok for you and your siblings to have different relationships with her and to let her know you care and respect her even if she isn\u2019t legally your mother.", "Info: How old are your grandparents and are they supportive of you not wanting to be adopted?", "I mean soft pressure. Maybe they think they let you down or your mother if they go for it? Thats why soft yta, and the judgement is not based on what you want for yourself, but because I got the impression that you basically (intentional or not) convinced your younger siblings who are 10 and 11.\n\nIf I were your dad, that is what I would think about it. I mean, stepmom is their motherfogure, right? If something happens to dad, they might get seperated.", "I think that's something he should have been upfront with.

Yes, absolutely it is to me. I don't want to be adopted and I especially don't want to be adopted by someone I don't love.", "agreed. However, she could start \\*acting\\* like a mom.

Being adopted by someone else would stop those benefits.", "They have tried to talk to dad about it and they told him he shouldn't push the issue.

That's already technically in place and we had like four different couples outlined for guardianship for years, with both sets of grandparents in the top two slots.", "Thank you for pointing this out. Too many people think one *needs* to adopt a child after one parent passes away. It's fully not necessary.", "It would depend really. I don't think anyone in our family would fight if she wanted my siblings and they wanted to stay with her. It's possible they would choose to go wherever I go too and she might fight that.

I agree there are finances here somewhere", "Yup! I was in a similar spot to OP and my late mom's survivor's benefits supported me the last year and a half of high school after I had to leave that household (stepmother situation where the most toxic aspects of my father were brought out permanently). My older (half-) sister's mom (father's first wife) was always like a second mom to me and planned to adopt me after I turned 18/graduated high school (same month) so that I wouldn't lose out on my mom's benefits. Unfortunately she got sick and passed away before we could do this.", "It might seem like too much but I really encourage you to mention these latest developments with them and other family members that you can trust. Your father might get angry but you need the backing of adults, as he is likely to continue to paint you as the \"bad child\" until he receives reality checks from people he does not have control over.   \n\n\nIf the original birth certificate is so insignificant, how would a new one be any better? Your father and step-mother want to pretend that it is for security, yet it is in fact a way to take legal protections away from you and your siblings. Right now, your mother's family can intervene in things - any further erasure of your mother, bad parenting, mistreatment and so on. If you were adopted, they could separate you from those family members for good, without any repercussions whatsoever, leaving you exposed. Replacing your mother's name on you birth certificate does not only erase history with a deceased person, it also separates you from living family members. Your father (and step-mother) know(s) this - a red flag.   \n\n\nBe careful, stay safe, stay strong and keep in contact with those adults that you can rely on. It is not trouble-making or disrespectful to look out for yourself and others, it is your current guardians that are not looking after you. I feel sorry for your paternal grandmother if your father would so easily erase her from his family; if not, and he is hurting still, then he is a hypocrite. Adults are not always right, nor do they always have the best intentions. That is not to say that your guardians are actively trying to be bad ones, but everything that they are doing is emotionally manipulative and selfish.", "Can I just commend you on being so on it in terms of the legality?

First type is \"adoption simple\" and means you can inherit from an adoptive parent (and they are supposed to take care of you) but you don't sever the relationship with the biological family. The other (if you want to adopt abroad and give them your nationality) is full adoption (adoption pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re).

It is what he views as being in your best interest.\n\nAlso, I know you said you researched it, but I just want to point out that whether or not a certificate has to be amended is location-dependent.

He also wants to feel like he's doing the best for his kids.\n\nHe's feeling pretty disrespected that I am not closer to the woman he chose to join our family and bring in as a second mom. That disrespected feeling only growing when factoring in I said no to being adopted since day one and now even more that my siblings said no.\n\nHe's discounting the fact that even kids can know enough about their world and family and feelings to figure out that we can genuinely not want something the adults/parents think is best.\n\nI also think he changed a lot after mom died and he has less patience and is more prone to anger.

It would be disrespectful if you treated her with disrespect, but \u201cnot feeling close\u201d to someone is not \u201cdisrespect.\u201d\n\nShe has been in your life for a long time, and I can see why he would want you two to be close.   However, if they didn\u2019t put the time and energy into healthy relationship-building with the kids PRIOR to the marriage, it isn\u2019t surprising that kids feel like the relationship is forced on them and the relationships don\u2019t grow. If he wanted to take the approach \u201cthis is who I choose to be my wife, so you\u2019re going to have to get used to it,\u201d then he can be okay with the outcome: \u201cgreat, I\u2019ll accept her as your wife, but you can\u2019t expect me to accept her as a mom.\u201d \n\nIt is unreasonable to force someone into a permanent relationship and then expect them to happily engage in whatever you dictate that relationship to look like.  Especially when they are older children. As a parent, he CAN set an expectation of how you will behave toward her, but he cannot expect emotional connection, trust, and relationship to grow.", "I edited my answer to clarify that I meant that you are choosing this relationship with your mom over your relationship with your dad, not your stepmom. Your deceased mom means more to you than your dad ever will. That is the choice you made.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth mentioning that love is not a zero sum game. You can love or appreciate your stepmom in a way that does not replace or diminish your love for your mom in any way. She sounds like she has been a blessing in your family\u2019s life. You can choose to not be adopted by her, of course, but avoid choosing that out of some misplaced loyalty to your mom. You can hurt this woman all you want and it\u2019s not going to bring your mother back. Ask your dad to arrange more counseling. You need it.", "I would discuss this with them. It is extremely unfortunate that something you, rightly, consider personally important (the name of your mother on your birth certificate) is strongly linked to something which is legally important.\n\nI would suggest, if possible, to try to separate these two -- one option (and please do feel free to reject this), would be to try and consider the birth certificate as \"just some legal document\" -- the name written on it doesn't define who your birth mother was, it's just a way of the government keeping track of things for their legal purposes. You, or your siblings, might have to change those names for legal reasons but that doesn't change your feelings, or reality. In practice, other than for these types of legal purposes (getting passports, who legally looks after you) no-one is ever going to look at your birth certificate anyway.\n\nYou could arrange some other way of staying connected to your mother -- when my mother passed me and my siblings were all already in our 20s, so we got together and got custom identical necklaces made we could all wear, to stay connected to our mother and to each other, which is something I have with me all the time (right now in fact).", "Please do this.

So every adoptive birth certificate is a lie? Damn, that\u2019s a horrible take. You must really hate adoption. Most of the kids I know who are adopted were adopted after their parents lost parental rights due to horrific abuse and neglect. I\u2019m pretty sure they understand their new parents didn\u2019t conceive or birth them. The amended birth certificate simply identifies their new parental relationship in an official way.\n\nAnyway, as I said above and below, it\u2019s submarining other children\u2019s adoptions which is the asshole move here and which affected his relationship with his Dad.

That they have been using emotionally manipulative language and aggressive behaviour (from the father) to get what they want? That the only reason that it would be the \"last time\" is because the son is too old, they are still going to pressure the younger children to undergo the adoption? Sure, it is the child that is the manipulator ... Smh.", "No. It's not. It's 100% the truth and they deserved to hear it. If OP didn't tell them no body would have. I think it's time to rethink your whole thoughts on this. OP only explained to their siblings that if stepmom adopts, their real mom gets removed from their birth certificates. What part of telling the 100% truth is manipulation \ud83e\udd23", "Bull.\n\nNow you're even misrepresenting what Dad said.", "You're growing more disingenuous by the moment", "No, the horrible take is your entire attitude towards OP.\n\nI see that you are super pro adoption. That's great! However, that doesn't mean it's the right choice 100% of the time.", "I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a \u201chorrible take\u201d to say that altered birth certificates are not factual. They aren\u2019t. That child was not born to that person. I don\u2019t hate adoption, but I do see erasing the facts of someone\u2019s origin against their will, or without their informed consent to be an enormous violation of their basic rights. You don\u2019t need an amended birth certificate to designate legal guardianship. Whether or not a child was removed for a \u201cgood reason\u201d does not negate the reality that altering a legal document is not an accurate record of their birth.  That\u2019s the purpose of a birth certificate. To legally record a birth. Children whose birth certificates are altered no longer have a legal right to access that information. Some states are catching up, but most are woefully archaic in their withholding of vital records. \n\nThe comment I responded to was pointed and accusatory. Comments like \u201cyour deceased mom means more to you than your dad ever will,\u201d and \u201cyou can hurt this woman all you want and it\u2019s not going to bring your mother back\u201d make huge assumptions about his values and reasoning.  Nowhere did he say he chose this to try to hurt his stepmom. Nowhere did he say his mom means more than his dad.  That\u2019s ridiculous. Accusing him of choosing his mom over his dad is misguided and unkind.  This isn\u2019t an ultimatum.  If his dad IS presenting him with that kind of ultimatum, that\u2019s on the dad, not on the kid. The kid cannot be held responsible for \u201cchoosing one over the other\u201d unless the adults are forcing that choice. Any dad who bases his willingness to have a relationship with his kid on the kid\u2019s decision to be adopted by stepmom is unreasonable. \n\nEven your label of his conversation with his siblings as \u201csubmarining\u201d is inflammatory. His siblings asked him. He answered honestly.  He did not try to convince them. They didn\u2019t need it. They didn\u2019t want to be adopted in the first place."]}
