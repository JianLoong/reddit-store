At the time they spoke about her adopting the four of us. I said no. There was some debate between them and they decided to hold off until she could adopt all four of us. She was still new to me so I found it incredibly weird to have someone offer to adopt me 5 months after I met them and especially when she and my dad were both aware that I remembered mom.\n\nNone of my siblings have ever called our stepmom \"mom\". Thea and Dex call her by a nickname and Calia calls her by her name like me. But my siblings consider her a parent while I consider her more my dad's wife.\n\nThe adoption topic never really went away and a couple of years ago I did some research and learned that adoption would alter my birth certificate and I would be issued with a new one if I agreed. My stepmom's name would replace my mom's name as my mother. I did a lot of research on the topic because I knew the issue would reach a boiling point eventually. I even got to web chat with a local lawyer who knew the details of that stuff.\n\nA couple of months ago my siblings asked me why I mentioned downsides to being adopted and I told them stepmom's name would replace mom's on our birth certificates and I did not want her to replace mom on mine. I showed them what I found. Calia understood and Thea and Dex got it when we put it into more kid friendly terms.\n\nMy dad and stepmom brought up the adoption again last week and dad said it would be the last time or they would proceed with her adopting my siblings. I said my answer remained no and gave them a very detailed speech on why. My stepmom said I could always frame my original birth certificate if that would make it better and people would see it but I would still be adopted and be her son. I said no.\n\nWhen they did go to my siblings they all said no and all said they didn't realize mom's name would be erased and they didn't want that. My dad and stepmom tried to coax them out of their no but they all said they didn't want it and Calia said they only ever said yes because they felt like they should, not because they really wanted to be adopted.\n\nMy dad was furious with me and said it was all my fault and I had made them change their minds.

He is not considering the security their birth certificate with their actual mother\u2019s name on it provides to them. Stepmom needs to learn to respect Mom\u2019s position.  If she lets this ruin her relationships with them, she is petty and immature.  \n\nI come at this from 2 view points:\n1) I am an adoptee who did not have a say in whether my birth certificate was altered.  I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone, and feel protective of any child who is feeling pressured to do so. \n2) I am a mother of teens. If I died and my children didn\u2019t want to erase me from their birth certificate, I would be honored and thankful. There is nothing wrong with your desire to keep your legal identity and historical record accurate and consistent.\n\nStand strong, sweetie! I am so sorry your father is handling this so poorly.

It didn't. I didn't know it changed the birth certificate until I needed it when I first got married.

He can set up a large life insurance policy, draft up legal documents to provide a trustee and have that policy money go into a trust to care for you all.

It would mean for example that if a grandparent had made a will stating that a portion of their money was to be divided among grandchildren might not know that this could exclude the person adopted out of their family.

It erases your birth parents existence basically. I hate that we do that in all adoption circumstances. \n\nA college friend of mine had her second husband adopt her daughter with her husband who passed from cancer and internally it destroyed me.

Having your step mom have legal say in their lives is a safety net in case the worst should happen to your dad.

If your dad (this is sad but ... it is what it is) dies. Where would you and your siblings go? If they are adopted by stepmom- there is no question. Maybe stepmother takes yall in... maybe not. There are also inheritance and life insurance things to. The security aspect is important. \n\nBut also- do what you want. Being adopted is also part of the choice. Adoption is a two way street at yalls ages. Just make sure your stepmother knows you do appreciate her and what she does for your siblings. Sounds like she is a decent stepmother at least. Be grateful for that for sure.", "Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be voted NTA. Reddit hates step parents.", "NTA \nBut there might be some very good reasons why adoption is important to her. Depending on where you live, it can be difficult for her to e.g. travel with your siblings, getting information from the school, getting medical information etc. if she is not a legal parent.\nBut most important:\nIf your father divorces her, she would likely have no custody rights at all.\nHe could leave her tomorrow, take the kids and refuses her to ever see them again.\n\nI know several women being in this is situation. One have known the kids since they were 2 years old, love them either all her heart , but she cannot leave her husband because she would loose all contact with the kids (the mom is alive). This gives their marriage a toxic dynamic.\n\nI had a colleague who had to stay with her slightly abusive boyfriend, because of his daughter. The mother had passed away when she was an infant, my colleague had been the only mother figure she knew, but when she was around 10 year old the father got anger issues.

You dad and stepmom know this, that is why they ask you and talk with you. And it only is a choice, if it is OK to say no. It is okay to say no!\n\nI think you made a mistake. I believe remembering the dead is only good, if it helps the living. Yes, it helps you and your siblings to remember your mom. And it helps you to remember her, by her name written as your mother on your birth certificate. I understand it.

Framing that certificate may be a good starting point (maybe use a copy and keep the original away from sunlight), it already is important to you now. But also do something together with you siblings. Maybe ask your dad what her favorite food was and then all of you cook it together. Don't forget to put a plate down for her! Or you watch her favorite movie together. Ask you dad about some stories of her. Give her some place in your new life, other than a name on a document.

And your dad is incorrect about you robbing them of any security that adoption would provide since there are other means to provide that security (that are actually less cumbersome & expensive as adoption).  He could go to an attorney & have papers drawn up to have her as your defacto legal guardian should anything happen to him.

You would definitely be safe without having an adoptive mother.", "INFO: Are you and your siblings the ages listed in the first sentence? I'm a bit confused.\n\nI think you're NTA and arguably your dad and stepmom are TA because they're trying to 'force the issue'.\n\nNevertheless, I think what I'm about to say applies:\n\nMy parents separated when I was about 7\u00bd.\n\nMy mom soon after started dating her now husband, my dad soon after started dating his now fianc\u00e9e (spelling?). This happened relatively soon after because both my parents had wanted to separate before they had me but all grandparents went together and basically said \"erm, no?\" and they felt forced to try and stay together. In the years they were together, they also had my sisters, twins, when I was 2\u00bd.\n\nAnyway, our stepdad was a hard working man. Both professionally and privately. He treated us really well but fairly, and around the time I was 9\u00bd, my mom and stepdad had my youngest sister. Through this, he kept treating us all as-if we were all his children.\n\nOn the flipside, our dad progressively treated us worse than our stepsiblings and/or let our stepmom effectively treat us as less-than compared to her own children. Around the time of my sisters graduating from highschool, they had gone no-contact with him. I did the same after I moved to Ireland and in the first three years of living there, he never even considered coming to visit. (he was the GM of the largest golf club in our city) This is obviously a hyper-condensed version of events but needless to say, it was warranted because he treated me more like a nice-to-have when telling stories about his kids, rather than as his actual kids...\n\nAbout one or two years after I went no-contact (2015~ish), I started considering the choice of adult adoption with my stepdad. Ultimately, I wasn't wild about the idea because it felt like I'd be delivering the \"killing blow\" to a person - I mean, can you imagine being a parent and being informed by the courts that your child wants to disown you in such a way? And on top of it, to a person that you absolutely hate (my bio dad **hates** my stepdad))\n\nI told my stepdad about this at some point and we both cried and were happy that we had such love for each other and he said he was proud that despite all I had experienced from my dad, I was still a considerate and kind person.\n\nUltimately, around last years new year, my sisters had decided they wanted to go through with the adult adoption, and they - together with our stepdad - asked me if I had reconsidered. I told them I'd think about it and they said that they could wait until I was back in Sweden next time again, since I'd have to sign the papers that would need to be submitted to the court.\n\nWe all ended up going through with it and as of last July, we were all officially adopted and our stepdad is now our father. We never once felt coaxed into the decision and to a degree, he was almost trying to push us out of it just to be sure we weren't doing it \"just because\".\n\nI say all this because if your dad and your stepmom are open the adoption, I would argue that they both need to put in the work that it means to be a deserving parent, allow all kids however much time they need to come to their own decision and ultimately respect whatever decision is made.\n\nBeing a parent is supposed to be the best thing in the world - I cannot imagine the absolute privilege it must be to, as a step parent, be asked by the stepchild to adopt them and to become the parent-parent.\n\nWhile your stepmom and dad might have their hearts in the right place, this is not something that they should force. If it's meant to happen, you kids will see it for yourselves in the future and how deserving it'll be for your stepmom!", "NTA. Self-centered dad married the woman, the children did not.

They're adults, they need to just accept things and move forward because letting this remain a point of contention will sour your relationship with her, and in the end the feelings of rejection she might have will worsen, which will affect her relationship with your father and everything goes to shit.

I think she wants to see you as her children - and again, you're totally justified and its ok - but it obviously hurts them both to be rejected.\n\nI'm not saying they haven't acted prematurely in this, but I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. They obviously love you and want to make a family with you, and probably felt like they have made a family over the years. They probably wouldn't have anticipated you talking to a lawyer and speaking with your siblings over it (and I would bet they weren't malicious in not making it clear to you what would happen to your name if you let them adopt you), so all they had against the legal point was hope and a desperate attempt at a compromise to frame the certificate and keep honouring your mother.\n\nOn Dad's side, I can understand two things.\n\nFirst, your mother died tragically just when the family was getting started... Your Dad probably understands that life can change in an instant. I think his Security argument is valid (though I'm not a lawyer, maybe Security isn't a concern, happy to be corrected).\n\nI can also understand Dad's frustration at seeing his wife rejected as a mother. The decision - again, justified as it is - does cause a fracture in the family, I'm sorry to say. Its 100% ok if you and your siblings don't mind if it never heals, but I think your Dad & his wife's frustration and sadness over this will persist. I could picture her leaving. She might love you & your Dad but if she wants a close loving family then she might need to make the right decision for her.\n\nWe've seen enough AITA posts to know that malicious Stepmothers can be far more destructive and far less compromising than I think, she has been.\n\nDid they force the issue knowing there was a chance you'd all say no? Yup. But idk, love demands risks doesn't it. Sometimes it overpowers the idea that rejection can happen.

It can add trauma to kids who have already suffered tremendous loss. And it offers no added security to the kids.

If your relatives aren't nearby, or your Dad knows they wouldn't make the decisions he would want, then I can kind of see his point.  If that's not the case, and the relatives are who you would want to go to, then the \"security\" is about your Stepmom not getting her heart broken if she lets herself get attached to you only to not be legally able to keep you if your father passed before your majority.  If you would have to change schools and leave friends to live with relatives, you know that.

Have you tried talking openly with them and asking why they want to adopt you and your siblings?\n\nThe whole re-writing someone's birth certificate thing kinda sucks but it is probably done because in most cases a birth certificate is the only legal document that names someone's parents. Ultimately it is more of a legal and logistical thing and these often don't make sense but that isn't always a good reason to not do something. \n\nThere are also a whole bunch of really good reasons why adoption by a step parent would be a good and helpful thing to do. It gives the step parent the legal rights of a parent meaning that they can make medical decisions for the kids, as well as less significant things like school paperwork.

In the worse case scenario where your father passed away then your step mom might have no parental rights and your siblings could end up in foster care. \n\nIt might also be good for the younger kids to have the sense of stability that adoption might give them. Your step mom might also really want to adopt her step kids for emotional reasons- especially if she doesn't have any biological kids. Equally if she and your dad were planning to have biological kids then her adopting your siblings first might help to minimise feelings of rejection and thinking that they weren't loved as much as the bio kids.\n\nIdk if any of the above reasons apply to your family but it sounds like you wouldn't know either because you haven't given your dad and step mom a chance to explain.\n\nBut...\n\nYour dad should have been more understanding and should not have gotten so angry.

I don't really agree with either of those two feelings. But if we acknowledge that your parents have them, it may be up to you to be the adult (I am so so sorry I even just wrote that).\n\nIt sounds like you have a strong family around you, I would ask a couple of the adults to work with you to develop some sort of adoption ceremony, where the kids EMBRACE* your stepmother.  Tell her you are her family, and that she is wanted and loved.\n\nThe holidays are coming up, this is a good time for that. Make sure that you schedule it at a time that doesn't interfere with bigger plans. So like the weekend before Thanksgiving.  I wouldn't turn it into a party, but it's probably a good idea to have the adults that helped you there as assistants and witnesses.  \n\nYou probably need an adult like a grandparent, an aunt or uncle to pull your father aside and say that this does not mean that you guys have changed your mind about the adoption. You don't want to cut ties to your birth mother. But you also want to make sure your stepmother knows that you guys value her and love her.  \n\nIf your embracement ceremony goes well, make sure that you follow it up with demonstrations of love that your stepmother wants.  So you need to look up love languages and figure out what hers is and show your love for her in the ways that she values. This is good practice for all of your future relationships.\n\nUltimately, a piece of paper doesn't make a family.\n\n* I needed a synonym for adopt. Please don't crucify me.\n\np.s.\nLove is an interesting thing. I foster children and love is one of the things we discuss with them.  For foster children this is very complex issue, they love people who are often abusing them in more than one way. They desperately crave love, and even in the first few days in a new foster home some of the kids want you to tell them that you love them.  We talk about love being like a plant. It's something that grows over time, love also has to be tended. \n\nOne of the things that you learn as you age is that trust is the soil that the love plant grows in. Without trust, the plant can't grow as big or as strong. And when you damage the trust it affects love, too.  When your parents are bullying you about the adoption, it shakes the trust, and unfortunately that traumatizes the love plant.  It introduces the question, is my father's love conditional? Is my stepmother's love conditional?  I feel like one of the reasons you started therapy, but didn't keep going, is because they very quickly figured out that the therapist wasn't going to side with them.\n\nThe most important thing about love is that it's not one plant. We talk to the kids about how it's wonderful that love is just like the grass and the trees - it surrounds us. So you can love your brother, which doesn't affect loving your father, or your stepmother, or your grandparents, or your aunties.  So the amount of love that surrounds us isn't limited. If we choose to lay foundations of trust, plant love seeds, and then tend the plants, we can build a forest of love.  \n\nEven with romantic love. When you love someone, like your first girlfriend, breaking up doesn't automatically mean that love plant has died. But it does change the plant. And the next girlfriend isn't represented by the first plant, they have an entirely different plant.  Young and old people struggle a lot with having feelings for people they have moved away from.  But this is okay, and is totally normal.  It's possible to not have romantic feelings towards someone anymore, but anyone who tells you they don't have any feelings at all is lying to themselves.\n\nYou each have a love plant for your mother. And you have tended that plant.  I imagine family around you has also helped you feed the plant, so that it has grown big and strong. A small warning, since your mother is gone nothing can shake the foundation of her plant. This can lead to idolization, which is a problem of its own.  It's important to understand that if your mother were still here, you are a teenager and you would be having arguments with her as you find your space and grow.  Just as you have missed a thousand hugs, you have also missed a thousand arguments.\n\nYour father and stepmother don't understand that his plant, her plant and your mother's plant can all grow together happily.  Each love plant has its own space in your heart.  It's not a competition.\n\nI would strongly recommend that all of you start going to therapy again.\n\nMuch love, and good luck! \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udc95", "Oh Im not assuming anything.

He, on the other hand, has always referred to me as his daughter (to the extent that many people don't even know I came before his marriage to my mom). That did bother me when I was younger and our relationship was rockier, but it also helped cement in my adulthood that he was a solid resource for me. If I've ever been in trouble or worried about something, I've been able to reach out without fear that he'd push me aside because I'm not his kid.

In an respectable amount of time he started dating, and then got married. Your stepmom and dad asked about adoption and you said no, and they dropped it and said they\u2019d bring it back up once you got used to the new situation. Nothing in your story points to your stepmother being bad, to you or to the other kids. They brought up adoption again, and you said no again, and told them why.

Legal guardianship, unlike adoption, gives a person all the same rights over a child as a natural parent would have but leaves the birth certificate unaltered.
