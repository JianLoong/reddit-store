That's awful and dangerous. Complain in writing to the appropriate authorities. Reckless driving AND held against your will? Not okay.", "NTA. I don't know what Uber's policies are (it would be good for you to look into that), but I can't imagine they would approve of a driver LOCKING the doors to keep a passenger in!  \n\nAlso, if the driver was violating traffic laws, it's understandable that you would be concerned for your safety.  You should be able to leave in that situation, but again, I dont know what Uber's official policies are.  \n\nIs there a dash cam or any evidence to back up your version of events?", "NTA - the driver is out of line and should let you out at the first request. It\u2019s never okay to hold someone hostage. Very weird and scary behavior. I suggest you still call and report him. There\u2019s no way you should be the one getting suspended.", "NTA.  He put your life in danger and then kidnapped you, WTF.", "I would actually bypass Uber and go to the police. That is borderline kidnapping", "NTA. Just use Lyft, but I would definitely send a letter pointing out the facts first, then expressing how you feared for your safety.", "NTA\n\nI'm not an Uber or Lyft user, so I can't speak to how the rider account works or the terms of service, etc.  However...\n\nIf you feel unsafe in a situation, you have every right to remove yourself from it.  You had every right to ask the driver to let you off.  The driver was in the wrong for refusing to pull over and let you exit the vehicle.  And locking you in... I would think that is criminal.\n\nIf you haven't reported the driver, do.  Report to Uber if you aren't blocked from doing so, and also the police.  I don't know if there is a way for you to contest the suspension of your account, but I would look into it if I were you, especially if you talk to the police and end up filing a report.  The driver's actions, attitude, and behavior are absolutely unacceptable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  As for the driver being unfamiliar with the city... that is no excuse for breaking traffic laws and endangering the passenger (you), as well as other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.  If you asked to be let out in a civil way and the driver refused and argued with you, forcing you to escalate... then no.  You were not too harsh.  Still NTA.", "It doesn't sound like you're TA at all, because you should always be able to get out if you feel unsafe. I'm really surprised that Uber is backing that up. I would contact customer service and in the meantime NTA.", "NTA. If you felt uncomfortable, then you had every right to leave. And if the door was locked, you had every right to threaten the driver with authorities. You didn't feel safe.", "NTA. You had every right to get out. That\u2019s fucked up. It sounds like he lied about something to Uber to get you banned. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not trying to blame you or anything cause I could totally understand being a little panicked in this situation, I\u2019m just confused, are there cars where you can\u2019t unlock it from the inside door handle or the little nub by the window? Or did he have the child locks on? Cause that seems like a HUGE no-no for a driver and I would definitely report that.", "Oh hell no. You feared for your safety and refused to pull over Nta", "NTA. You\u2019re safe now, all that matters. Hopefully your account will be usable again", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
