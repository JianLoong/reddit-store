Breaking a promise after a friendship ends could easily be considered a form of revenge. You are definitely an asshole for doing this.\n\nYour friend obviously shouldn't have been cheating and then roping you guys into covering.

I might be biased here but I feel like when you are cheating so blatantly that you lose your right to control how other people react to it. Yeah you made a promise not to show anyone but ultimately that promise was founded on a desire not to betray your friend\u2019s act of betrayal, for lack of a better way of saying it. If she can\u2019t even honor her lifetime promise to her partner, why should she expect you to keep to your promise of not posting her, especially when you guys don\u2019t even have a relationship anymore? It\u2019s not like she hates being on social media, or doesn\u2019t want to upset her family or something\u2026 she just doesn\u2019t want her infidelity to get outed, and IMO you have no responsibility toward helping her keep that secret.

I\u2019ve been through it all. But if the standard is that every type of male/female interaction is cheating then there will literally never be marriage or children ever again.

I knew the bar was on the ground for most people but your standards are next level low.", "Oh no that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all\u2026I\u2019m just more saying the reaction to it when it happens needs to be very realistic.", "Well maybe think of it this way, if you had like a 2 year relationship and you lived together and shared pets and payments, etc\u2026 most people would not get rid of that for something like kissing another person.\n\nThat\u2019s just reality.", "No, that's sad and pathetic. You only think it's reality because no one who posts on reddit is able to leave toxic or unhealthy relationships. In real life, people I know do leave if they are cheated on, and yes, kissing people outside of your relationship is considered cheating most of the time."]}
