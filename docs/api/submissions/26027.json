After she went my bf told me that they're safe and he's eaten them tons of times with no issues and was not happy with me for upsetting her.

There are a lot of lookalikes out there, and, in the great outdoors, there's nothing to stop a poisonous look-alike from growing alongside an edible variety (well, some species exist only on certain trees, etc., but I'm generalizing). \n\nI've known several biologists (PhDs and PhD candidates) who forage mushrooms, and not one of them would ever eat a mushroom, or offer a mushroom to someone to eat, without first identifying the species. Nor would any of them be offended if someone refused to eat it.", "NAH - it's outside your comfort zone with potentially deadly consequences if she's wrong.", "NTA.  There is a safety concern there, so it is your choice to eat the foraged mushrooms or not.  Yes, they are most likely fine, but if that's a risk you don't want to take, you don't have to take it.  I personally wouldn't eat it either.", "NTA\n\njust because he did not have a reaction to the mushrooms, does not mean you won't\n\nI love mushrooms but I to am always wary of foraged mushrooms, some very poisonous fungi  look almost identical to the safe ones.", "NTA \n\nI think everyone should have their right to choose what to consume or not and not be admonished against their will.", "NTA.\n\nThat's a reasonable response, you don't know her or her skills.

He's an AH for trying to make you feel bad over it, what you eat is your choice.", "NTA for not being comfortable eating foraged mushrooms but definitely the AH for the \"eat mine too\" comment.  This was one awkward situation you found yourself in.  They really should have asked you beforehand about eating foraged mushrooms.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t eat that either.", "NTA No one should force or bully anyone to eat food they don't want, for any reason.", "NTA\n\nI dislike cooking for other people or having them make me meals. I have gotten horrid food poisoning from someone and it made me very unlikely to trust random people with my food.", "NTA for declining\n\nHowever YTA for your reaction.", "NTA I myself won't eat just anyone's cooking no matter what other people think of their cooking. You are not obligated to spare someone's feelings against your own discomfort. You were polite about it and your boyfriend was wrong for trying to make you feel guilty for not just eating something you weren't sure of, like you said if he had no problem with the food, he was welcome to eat your share. If the sister wanted to feed everyone breakfast, she should've made something basic and put the mushrooms in her food, or at least asked if anyone wanted mushrooms in their food. When you have guest you try and accommodate them by not cooking as you would for yourself or close family, this will at least make them feel like you are considerate. You might tell your boyfriend this for the future when he feels the need to chastise you for not sucking it up.", "Nta. You have the right to eat or not eat what you like, as long as you aren't demanding or rude. Your bf shouldn't have pressed on.", "NTA. As someone with a fear of food, I would definitely do what you did. Obviously Idk your relationship with food, but if you felt unsafe or uncomfortable, don't put it in your body! Even if they were completely safe, who's to say that you wouldn't of had a bad reaction simply because you were unsure and felt unsafe.", "NTA- You have every right to refuse any dish offered to you. You don\u2019t even have to give a reason if you don\u2019t want to. I personally love foraging, but I\u2019m also very cautious.", "NTA for looking out for your health.

But you were perfectly within your rights to refuse to eat foraged mushrooms from somebody you don't know well.

You could've asked more questions but you chose to refuse and act childishly. Poor first impression.", "YTA for your reaction, the refusal is understandable, though. I am a forager too and was met with mistrust in my early years, but learned not to take it personally, lol.\n\nYour reply however left a really poor first impression, what about \"I'll take a small piece now and maybe more next time, sorry, these are just my own hang-ups\".", "YTA for the snotty response. Not for preferring not to eat the shrooms. Grow up kid sis!", "You could not bully her into YOUR rules, huh?", "> because I don't know how experienced she is with foraging\n\nWhy didn't you ask then. \n\n\nLook, you either trust your bf and his family to not poison you, or you don't. \n\nIf you don't, then by all means - run away as far as possible.
