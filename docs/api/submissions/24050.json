Very new to how this stuff works, so bare with me. \n\nI 22F have a niece 13F I\u2019ll call her Bailey. Her stepmom (been present all her life) is 37F I\u2019ll call her Kiersten. \n\nI have a small business on Etsy that I\u2019ve been running since 2020 during the pandemic where I paint bibles or any book (I painted a Book of Mormon once) and sell them. This small business is how I make money on the side as my job doesn\u2019t really support me enough. \n\nMy bibles are a little expensive this is because it takes a lot of time.\n\nBailey had recently joined Facebook, and I sometimes I post bibles I\u2019ve painted just to have something to share. There\u2019s not really a reason it\u2019s just my personal page. \nMy coworker Jennifer recently purchased a Bible from me, and I posted hers and tagged her in it. \nIt was definitely one of my prettiest ones, so my niece messaged me if I\u2019d paint her Bible. \n\nI told my niece that I paint bibles as apart of my small business, so if she wanted one she might have to wait around for her birthday or Christmas unless her mom (Kiersten) wanted to get her one. \n\nShe asked why she wouldn\u2019t get one for free because she\u2019s family and I told her that the supplies cost money, on top of the time it takes me to paint them. I don\u2019t blame her at all she\u2019s 13 so I understand why she\u2019d want one for free. \n\nA few hours later I get a call from Kiersten, which was odd because I don\u2019t talk to her as much as I talk to my brother and she asked me why I\u2019d try to scam Bailey. \n\nI told Kiersten that I wasn\u2019t scamming Bailey and told her that I wouldn\u2019t paint the Bible for free because it costs me a lot of money and time. \n\nKiersten said to me that it\u2019s a fundamental part of being Christian to not be greedy and that I was trying to shake money from a little girl when I should just do it because she\u2019s my family. \n\nI told Kiersten that Bailey wasn\u2019t just a little girl and that she can understand that people don\u2019t work for free, I also said that it\u2019s not that I wouldn\u2019t, she\u2019d just have to wait for her birthday or Christmas to get one which really isn\u2019t that far away. \n\nKiersten then took to Facebook and made a post about how family members let her down sometimes, she also told my brother and my brother then told my dad. \n\nIt\u2019s just going around the whole family tree. \n\nI may be the asshole because Bailey is only 13 and she is my family but it\u2019s also my small business. I get that Bailey is a kid, but I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to paint a Bible for her for free when it takes such a huge amount of my time. \n\nTLDR: I have a painted Bible business, my niece saw one of my bibles and asked me to paint her one, I said that she\u2019d have to wait for her birthday or Christmas unless her stepmom wanted to get her one.

I'm sure it would not occur to her to demand something from some other type of business venture you might be engaged in, but who knows.  Some family and friends have no problem prevailing on others.  That said, in my opinion, no one is entitled to what you are selling just for the asking.  The fact that you offered up maybe giving her one for her birthday or Christmas should have been well understood and accepted.\n\nI might add that it's not very \"Christian\" of your SIL to be bad mouthing you to others.", "NTA. Personally I wouldn\u2019t paint her one at all now. She whined to mommy to try to force your hand. Mommy didn\u2019t like your response so she\u2019s whining to everyone.

And you don't owe anyone, family or not, your time and effort for free.", "NTA\n\nThis is how you make a living for yourself. It costs that much because it takes you hours. And doing her for free means you cant earn money by doing one that someone paid for. Just because you're family, doesn't mean your time, and your supplies are free.\nAdditionally, you said that she could have one for free, but she just needs to wait for a birthday.", "NTA. \"It's a fundamental part of being Christian to not be greedy\" WHILE BEING FUCKING GREEDY. The cognitive dissonance is strong with this one.", "NTA\nBailey is just a kid, but everyone else certainly isn't. Your criteria for making one is perfectly reasonable, and they are rude to assume otherwise. \n\nAlso, weaponizing religion as a manipulation tactic like they did is just about the most un-Christian thing they could have done. NTA", "Wow! How f***ing greedy and manipulative! You are absolutely NTA. People like Kiersten is why people like me cringe when someone goes out of their way to let me know they\u2019re \u201cChristian\u201d. Let your actions speak to your faith. Kiersten is a con. I think Bailey should get a real special Bible with illustrations of greedy people burning in hell.", "NTA- this is your business. It\u2019s your time, effort and money that goes into these.", "NTA. It\u2019s not greedy to charge money for a product that you create as part of your small business. However, it IS greedy to feel entitled to free stuff. Especially when it\u2019s a want, not a need. And especially when it would take time away from creating a project that would make you money for your business. I paint bibles just as an amateur and put it on pause because it was too time consuming and expensive. Also takes up a lot of space. The supplies involve more than just the paint. \n\nOf course a 13 year old isn\u2019t going to understand this but her mom should.
