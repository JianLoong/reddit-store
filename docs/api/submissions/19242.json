Is this part of a pattern? Do you feel generally safe?\n\nThis action kind of eclipses everything else about the scenario; were it just a fight due to frustration for missing his kids for a weekend in a high stress scenario, there's room for forgiveness, but assaulting you is more than a \"kick him out of the delivery room\" situation, it's a \"Kick him out. Period.\" situation", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe was violent, giving you the silent treatment, being rude to the nurses and has taken your money and means to get home! All whilst you are heavily pregnant, so sick you are hospitalised and in desperate need of emotional support! I find it particularly worrying that he behaved this badly in public, I dread to think what he\u2019s like behind closed doors. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want him at the birth either or around a vulnerable newborn.", "ESH - Your husband sucks because instead of dealing with his emotions in a regulated and mature way, he was rude to the nurses and gave you the silent treatment. You suck because you escalated things by telling him, in a moment of anger, that he couldn't be there for the birth of not just yours, but his child as well. The decision wasn't well thought out, and you sprung it on him as a way to punish him because you were mad.\n\nI think you both need to work on yourselves, because life isn't about to get any easier for either of you.", "NTA!!\nBut I definitely would question if I want to raise a child with this man if I were you\u2026", "NTA. I can understand why you feel like one, banning him from the birth of your child is something that can't be undone. But your in the fucking hospital with the flu and *having contractions* and he's acting like this??? \n\nI'm terrified to see what'll happen during the actual delivery, when you're the most vulnerable you can possibly be and in massive need of a strong support system.", "DEEPEEENNNDDZZZ:\n\nFiRST of aLL (& basically everything we need to make our judjment on):\n\nIS THAT HIS CHILD YOU ARE CARRYING?\n\njust Hear me out, k?\n\n1) if you are pregnant with him, then, he is TA.\n\nLike wtf? he gatcha preggo in the first place. He don't know how hard pregnancies are on the females. He is a $h!t and an a$$ for treating you like this when you're 36 weeks pregnant.\n\n>he only sees them every other weekend, and every other week in the summer\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\nLike he couldn't wait maybe a week( when did this happen? ) to see his children? How much can you miss your children in a week?\nMost likely he didn't like the beds there or the food.lol\n\n2) if this ain't his, then:\n\nWhy did he marry you in the first place?\nAs mentioned, he already got his pack and you already got one & another on the way.\nHe sounds childish as hail. (not to mention petty)\n\nRethink your marriage!\n\nSounds like the both of you have already separate lifes, dreams, wants, etc => so if so , why even bother trying you know?\n\nYou are asking too much of him and doesn't seem like y'all are on the same page with anything.heck not even the same book! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nDepending on your answer:\n 1)\u2705=>NTA\n2) \u2705=> Everything Sucks", "ESH, but it's really tough to tell because you left out the part between \"I tried to talk to him and explain...\" and him tossing your phone at you. You haven't given us any information about what actually happened to cause you to ban him from the delivery room.\n\nHe's definitely and indisputably an AH for being rude and short with everyone because he is frustrated about a circumstance that's beyond your, or anyone else's, control. That kind of energy is very uncomfortable and with you being sick and in your last month of pregnancy, it's really not good for you or the baby to have any additional stress. If I were him, I'd be so worried sick that they wouldn't be able to tear me away from your bedside. He gets his kids every other weekend; he can sacrifice an extra weekend to be with you when you need him. He's being incredibly selfish, childish, and unsupportive. \n\nHis whole attitude is unacceptable, but I do think it's a little over the top to ban him from being there for the birth of his child. It feels like a power play on your part. It's possible he said or did some things during your argument that justify your anger and decision. Like, when he tossed the phone, did he pelt it at you? If so, NTA.\n\nBut if you're really set on keeping him away from the delivery room out of spite, I think you should just call it and end the marriage, because that's not something he will ever forgive you for. I think you should both cool down and really think about your priorities in this marriage.", "NTA\n\nSo he barely sees his children for some reason and now he\u2019s adding stress to an already stressful medical situation. What a winner. Good luck to that future child, yikes.", "NTA and time for a lawyer.", "NTA girl he threw shit at you while you're in the hospital and very pregnant and stranded you there while he has your personal documents. Run??", "Not the asshole but your husband sounds like he sucks really bad and is really unsupportive. I'm scared for you about what your future looks like if he has already made such a scene that you don't want him at the birth of your guy's child. Yikes. Hoping for the best for you.", "I would say you\u2019re kind of the asshole. He is frustrated that he cannot see his children. Is he dealing with it well? No, and that needs to be addressed, but you can\u2019t call a man an absolute arsehole because hes desperate to spend time with his kids and is unable to. That\u2019s the kind of man you want for your kids. But agajn, so it\u2019s clear, I am not excusing him. He is not handling his feelings appropriately but it\u2019s encouraging that is how he\u2019s feeling.", "We have not had any pattern of issues like this before. I usually feel safe, so I pretty startled when this happened. I just was shocked he did that, especially since I\u2019m sick and pregnant. \n\nI\u2019ve been questioning having him in the room for some time, as I don\u2019t want the added stress. I feel like his behavior with this shows how he will be when I give birth.", "I\u2019d really like some clarification from OP on this. I don\u2019t know if he threw it at her in anger or if he just tossed it lightly toward her the way people do with things all the time.", "We\u2019ve never had any violence issues in the past, so this was just completely unexpected. But I didn\u2019t even mention the lack of emotional support. Yikes.", "I don't think she's trying to punish him, I think she's genuinely concerned that he's going to behave like this while she's trying to push out another human being. If he complains about her spending too long in hospital over serious stomach flu (and gave her the silent treatment over it??) Then she's right to be concerned that he might get impatient during a long, difficult labour.\n\n\"It's his child too\" is for after the baby is born. He will still get to hold the baby and be present in the baby's life. But if he can't be helpful and supportive during the birth, he shouldn't be there at all. Being in the birthing room is a privilege, not a right.", "It is his kid I\u2019m carrying. We spent all weekend and half this week with his kids until I got sick. He said if I were in labor it would be one thing, but since I just have a stomach bug, he should be with his kids. \nI try to be understanding, but I just know how someone can be this apathetic, especially when I\u2019m carrying his son\u2026\nAnd I\u2019d it\u2019s like this now, how will it be in the delivery room? Yikes!", "I tried to explain to him that I wasn\u2019t intentionally sick or staying here to get attention, and that I believe I should be a priority, but I\u2019m not feeling like a priority. I also told him he was making things tougher on me by being upset, over a situation I can\u2019t control, and I didn\u2019t want to be further stressed out, as it could cause pre-term labor to start again. \nWe have had issues in the past, which make believe that his being in the birthing room would be extra added stress for me. I have been considering whether or not to have him in there, and then this happened. \n\nI think him tossing the phone at me is making me completely consider my options.", "Where do you see her calling him an absolute arsehole? \n\nHe left her stranded without her wallet and personal documents. She\u2019s very ill and about to give birth. He was rude to the hospital staff. When she mildly tried to cal him on it, he threw things at her. \n\nHe deserves to be called an asshole but I don\u2019t see her doing it.", "If your partner being in the room was already potentially \u201cadded stress\u201d the. You\u2019re absolutely NTA for saying it following this circumstance. This would also be a \u201cgoodbye, don\u2019t hit the door on the way out\u201d scenario for me.", "Yeah, I'm assuming that it was violent because it's kind of pointless as a detail to add in if it wasn't, but people aren't always good writers, so I could be wrong here", "He flung it at me backhandly. It hit the rail of the bed, and then flipped over the rail, and landed on the bed. So it was hard enough to not be stopped by the rail, but wasn\u2019t like he threw it at my head.", "It is common for violence to start during pregnancy. RUN", "> We have had issues in the past, which make believe that his being in the birthing room would be extra added stress for me. I have been considering whether or not to have him in there, and then this happened.\n\nBarring exceptional circumstances, if you believe that him being there in an extremely difficult and important time for you would be an added stress and not make things easier, that isn't a great sign for your ability to navigate any or the stress of parenthood together.", "I definitely tried to approach the situation mildly, and didn\u2019t call him any names or yell. I was crying because I was hurt and upset, but I think that\u2019s a normal response.", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly how I felt. If you are going to be a jerk now, then bye. \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "He still threw it *at* you. Here in the UK I'm pretty sure that a partner doing something like punching a wall is counted as domestic violence even though they haven't hit you - the act is a threat and threats are only one step away from actual violence against you and has similar/the same psychological effects.\n\nEven if he's being flippant, it's at the very least disrespectful and not something you'd do to a stranger let alone a loved one. Don't devalue your feelings and experience here, your safety matters. He may have been stressed but he should be getting support from other people, not taking out anger on you or the healthcare professionals doing their best for you and your child.\n\nETA just be careful how this progresses, that's all. Sounds like you need separate conversations about dealing with anger appropriately and another about how you're going to manage a blended family with a new half-sibling", "I think it\u2019s normal too", "I was pretty shocked he did it, especially with me being sick and kind of stuck in the hospital bed. \n\nI figure that right now, with this being a bad stomach flu, if he can\u2019t even keep his composure now, then it will only get worse when in the birthing room.", "Thank you", "The phone throwing, yelling at the nurses and leaving you in hospital, very sick, without your wallet and ID is extremely concerning. That last one is also abusive, he's essentially trapped you at the hospital.\n\nI would have a quiet word with one of the nursing team about getting this put on your pregnancy notes. They should be able to help you put it on your birthing plan that he will need to be monitored closely and removed/barred from the birthing room if necessary.\n\nPregnancy is a very emotional time, and if you think he will be a source of stress rather than strength while you're giving birth he absolutely should not be there.", "Thank you for the info! I didn\u2019t know they could put those kind of notes in my chart, but I will definitely talk to them now. \nMy parents are coming to sit with me, so I\u2019m not completely without, but they live far, and now they are bringing my 2 year old to the hospital and he will have to see me like this, which makes me even more irritable.", "I would hope that wherever you are they keep extensive pregnancy notes about anything that could   be a cause for concern during your pregnancy. And this is definitely a cause for concern. Your mental and emotional state are important medical information as well, so it should all go in there.\n\nI'm in the UK, so I don't know if it's different where you are, but they asked me a lot of questions about my partner in my first appointment (is he positive about the pregnancy, is he kind to me, do I feel confident I have all the help I need from him - all emphatic yesses from me lol) and if any of that information changed I would tell them straight away. \n\nThey also ask me about my mental health, and your midwife (or whoever is in charge of your pregnancy appointments) would want to know if something like this had tanked your mental health and made you question your relationship with your partner to the extent that you're considering banning him from the delivery room.", "They ask questions similar to that, but not as in depth. I will definitely be talking to them more once my folks leave. I\u2019m trying to not cry in front of my folks or my son. :/ \n\nThank you for the information, it is helpful. I think his behavior is disheartening, when he should be more supportive."]}
