It was something like \"uhh girl I know, white people frickin suck. I hate being half white, it's gross - I wish my dad wasn't white, it's the worst part of me!\" It was there enough time for her to realise and delete it and she went \"whoa dad I'm so sorry, that was for my friend.\" I was so disgusted, I didn't reply and ignored her. \n\nYesterday, I had a message from her going like \"hey dad! I'm thinking we should go and do whatever you want this weekend. We haven't done what you want in ages\". I was still really angry so I messaged her saying \"nah, I don't think you should hang out with me seeing as you hate white people so much. Spend the weekend with your mum and stepdad instead, I don't want to see you.\" I never heard anything back. \n\nThen, her mum messaged me saying she's distraught, crying and feels rejected by me. I told her what she said and admitted it's not great, but I should rise above and set an example!

I absolutely understand that. And your daughter should be punished for what she said. However, making this your hill to die on is just wrong. Your daughter is a child. Yes, she\u2019s 16, and probably thinks she\u2019s a proper grown up, but she\u2019s not. I\u2019m ignoring the racial aspect of this, because, in teen-brain speak, race could be replaced with \u2018he\u2019s so fat, I\u2019m so embarrassed\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019s so lame, I can\u2019t even\u2019.

Your feelings are valid, you know that, her mum knows that, and she knows that. But cutting her off is not going to teach her to be a better person. Talk to her, explain why you are so angry and hurt, talk to her about your childhood back here in the UK, introduce her to more of your culture so she knows where she came from.", "NTA because she is old enough at 16 to know better and be better.

And what some people don't seem to understand is that racism also works the other way around. I'm sure being biracial is not easy and she might struggle with her identity.

Give her time. \nAlthough your reaction might have been a little \"childish\", I can see how much her words hurt you.\nI wouldn't cut your daughter out of your life though. Meet up and talk about it and see where it goes from there.

Your daughter didn\u2019t ask you to do any of those things and neither did your ex \n- You\u2019re brewing resentment against a child who\u2019s growing up in a world that is still racist, and she\u2019s in a predominantly black school where she\u2019s hearing things like \u201cwhite people suck,\u201d instead of educating her you\u2019re chasing her away \n- What are you hoping to accomplish by refusing to see your daughter? \n- What are you hoping to accomplish by never seeing your child again?", "NTA.

So she thinks white people are less than stellar.. and her white dad throws her away rather than using it as a teachable moment? \n\nShe's still a minor. She was expressing herself to a friend. Do you think maybe your kid needs a therapist to talk to her about the self-image she has due to her race? If you kid is hating herself for being half-white, isn't this something to get her help for, so she doesn't hate herself or hurt herself?\n\nYou made it about you. Yes it was hurtful. But you had no clue otherwise what's going on in her head. Sounds like you've never had these conversations with her. If you don't talk about it, how can you support her, how can you judge her when you aren't there for her? \n\nYour kid sounds like she needs help, to accept herself, AND to work through her issues with race. Throwing away the minor child doesn't address or stop her racist viewpoints - it gives it fuel.", "NTA / i bet she tried making plans with you so you would forget about what she said", "ESH I'm a mother to a biracial child. Her dad is white. I would blow a fuse if this was my kid. Racism is racism regardless of who it's coming from. So I'm not going to fault you for your initial reaction. \n\nThat being said, you NEED to talk to her. She is your child. You are her parents, this is part of the job. Since she is crying about it, and she tried to just move past it with her text. She understands that what she did wasn't okay. \n\nSo have a proper sit-down and talk about all of this. About race, being different, etc. You need to hear what she has to say, and listen. Why did she say it? to fit in, or is it what she genuinely means? If she just trying to fit in, how can you help her, and so on. Let her talk, listen and help her navigate. \n\nWill it be hard? Yes sir. But that's part of being a parent.

She definitely shouldn't have said those things, and it's terrible that she said that and you're allowed to feel hurt.\n\nBut she's a 15 year old biracial person in the US who's probably struggling with her identity. Maybe she's dealing with something at school or struggling with feeling different. I mean, even reading the news and seeing the racial attacks against black people may be contributing to her viewpoint against white people. She's at a very influential stage, and she's clearly struggling with feelings of resentment toward a part of her identity she's struggling to resonate with.\n\nI know it's not exactly the same, but growing up as a british indian person was difficult, and I went through similar feelings of resentment towards being Indian myself, but I got through it.\n\nI feel like you need to sit down and talk to her about this, and maybe consider therapy so she can start to understand these feelings better.\n\nYes, you're hurt, as you're allowed to be.

She would just like to change your color.\n\nBut that doesn't make it any less hurtful. Your daughter writes that she rejects who you are, and what she partly is. I can't even imagine if my son would write something like this.\n\nWith your reaction you showed her that you where hurt, that you felt rejected, that it was totally not OK what she did.\n\nNow, I think, to help her learn this lesson by heart your next step in parenting could be to take her by her word and do something you suggest. If it is possible I would suggest going away from all of it, maybe hiking and camping if you are close to nature, and in the evening sit together and do the daddy - daughter talk. Tell her how it feels when your daughter thinks this. Maybe prepare some stories about bias, especially racism. Ask her what is so bad about \"white people\" - and then debunk it. The major point is that people with a simple mind want to reduce others to some Characteristics. \"Whites are\", \"girls are\", \"Young people are\"... She has to learn that people are individuals, and that bias is the superficial solution for people who don't want to or can't build their own opinion of the individual people they meet .

I miss the NHS right now.", "I think about it all the time trust me.", "Well as I updated in my OP, I'm going home to the UK on Thursday and I'll give her a break from me for a bit.", "I've just bought a ticket for this Thursday to go home.", "I would agree with that.\n\nHowever, I think that you are underestimating the difficulty he is facing to deal with that.  In a sane world it should be easily challenged on humanistic and antp-racist principles, but we don't live in a sane world.\n\nThis guy has no chance of dealing with this.", "It would absolutely have a different response from people.  You insulting me doesn't change that.", "Trust me I've read countless articles like that and I can't relate to it. Maybe it's being British and having a different perspective on being white than most white Americans - I can't relate to a lot of that article.", "I mean I've been followed in shops for no reason myself, and stopped by the police and searched at random at home for no reason at all. I've also been rejected from jobs because they don't have enough non-white employees and have too many white employees. I was even bullied as a kid by an Asian girl because she hates white people. I grew up in a British city that's majority non-white now. So I think I do.", "I do remember being a teenager, but I never said horrible things about other races. \n\nI mean yeah maybe I should be a bit more accepting of other people's opinions, but then I realise I'm a lot drunker than I thought hahaha", "Other than your daughter, do you have a good job in the states, friends etc?", "So, passive aggressive variety.of AH.  The kid who you've made feel like worthless trash because she fucked up, she's unforgivable, unworthy of conversation - the kid who only wants to see you and talk to you.  Dump her and justify it to yourself because she made a mistake and needs to be taught she's trash", "I hope that will give you both some time to cool off and get some perspective. I\u2019m sure she loves you, and I\u2019m sure you love her, it\u2019s just that sometimes in the teen years that love gets sidelined by the teen\u2019s struggle for identity and independence. She expressed some very shitty attitude towards you and it was hurtful but she didn\u2019t mean to say that to you directly. I think teens sometimes state opinions much more strongly than they actually feel, sort of as a way of trying on those opinions to see how they fit. After they hear (or see) the words outside of their head then it\u2019s easier to figure out how much of that they actually agree with. Anyways what I\u2019m trying to say is hang in there and don\u2019t forget that she really does love you, she\u2019s just struggling with identity stuff. If you\u2019re happier being in the UK right now go be happy and know that you two can still have a loving relationship in there future when she\u2019s grows up a little and figure out who she is.", "I hope it helps you. You need to not feel alone. And I hope your daughter will eventually seek therapy and offer a true apology. My daughter is 14 and half Chinese. I was a single mom and her dad was never involved. Do we joke about white people stuff? Yes cause stereotypes are funny, but never racist stereotypes. Like my daughter hates spicy foods and flavoring but I love it (I\u2019m white) and she will complain if my noodles are too spicy.", "I genuinely agree and I don\u2019t think is just some simple situation, it\u2019s very nuanced. \n\nOverall, I just found the reaction, as a parent, is not helpful. What she said was clearly horrid, and I\u2019ve maybe not done a good enough job saying I am sorry his feelings were hurt. I just think this is a situation to sit down and talk about, figure out where it\u2019s coming from etc rather than shutting out a child. Maybe I should have said ESH.", "Everything yu name didn\u2019t have nun to do with WHITE privilege. lol", "Neither did I, but I wasn\u2019t a biracial child trying to fit in. I\u2019m not saying you as a person are an AH, I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re the adult here, and just try and understand the difficult position she may be in. I think you guys could have a really good talk about all this and end up closer for it.", "The job is ok, although I work more hours than I should to make ends meet. I have a few acquaintances but nothing solid. No one I could consider a best friend.", "I agree with you, this reaction isn't helpful.\n\nThen next question would be what should he do, and how valid are his feelings.  I think his feelings are very valid.  I have no idea what he should do."]}
