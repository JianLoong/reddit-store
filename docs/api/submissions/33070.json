My half sister was 2 at the time and her dad was not in her life. My dad took full custody of me (he shared custody with mom when she was alive). My half sister was sent to a foster family because none of mom's family were fit to take her and they couldn't get in touch with her dad or any of his family. I can't say I ever really missed her. I knew about her but I didn't really love her back then so I never had any guilt for being raised in a loving home with my dad and stepmom while she was in foster care. We had two visits arranged by CPS in the first year after mom died but then those stopped.\n\nShe reached out to me a year ago via DMs and we have communicated a bit through there. She found my dad through social media recently and told him he was a disgusting shit and her not being his shouldn't have meant separating us and not caring about her. She told him a real good dad would have taken her because they loved me and couldn't stand the thought of an innocent little kid in foster care. She told him she would celebrate when he dies and will turn me against him if it's the last thing she does because I need my eyes opened.\n\nI found out about what happened and told her if she was going to try and turn me against my dad then she doesn't need to talk to me again. She went through how shitty she feels he was for letting her go into foster care and how a good person, a good dad, a good man, would have saved her. She told me I should hate him for what he did. I told her I didn't care that he refused to raise her. That it wasn't his job to. She asked how I could be so cruel and cold about this because we're siblings and I should adore her and want the best for her. She kind of lost it in DMs honestly so I muted her for a while and she kept sending them calling me all kinds of names.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: My parents were not together when my mom died. My dad never had any part in raising my half sister. He was never in the same household as her. I was still a baby when my parents broke up.", "created_utc": 1702651003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j1i5d/aita_for_telling_my_half_sister_that_i_dont_care/", "score": 4412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was NOT his responsibility to take on your mother's daughter, whom he had ZERO relationship with, after her death. Would it have been nice if he had? Yes. But he was not obligated to. \n\nI empathize with your half-sister, foster care can be horrible and it's not a stable way to live. She has every right to be angry, but... she is angry at the wrong person. Perhaps because your father is easier to find and easier to blame than the maternal family that failed her? \n\nI would tell her this point blank, in more or less those exact words. Tell her what she said to your dad was completely unacceptable and inappropriate, and until such time as she makes a SINCERE apology, you refuse to remain in contact with her. Also, tell her she needs to look into getting therapy- she clearly has a lot of anger and possibly even some trauma from her childhood, but it is not on you or your father to fix that for her.", "NTA - feel sorry that she went into the foster system but it was not your dad's responsibility to raise her.  It was her biological mother and dad's family, and they were either not capable or not willing to step up \\[assuming they could be found\\].\n\nWhy isn't she trying to go after her biological family?", "NTA  \n\n\nThere are things that one should only tell a very trusted friend or a therapist.  What she's doing right now?   Only a trained professional can help her sort that out.  If you want to help her, really help her, steer her to expert help.   \n\n\nYou aren't her fairy godmother.  You don't have a magic wand that will make everything all better for her.  She's wasting energy demanding that you do that for her.", "NTA. Your sister needs therapy.

If your father never have anything to do with her when your mother alive I understand why he wants nothing to do with her after your mother pass away. At single parent it hard enough to raise one children. I feel bad for her but if she wants to blame someone just blames her bio dad for not be in her life for her.", "Nta.

Your mom obviously wasn\u2019t expecting to die(and I\u2019m sorry she did) but she also thought that maybe your dad would take your sister if she did. Your sister needs to be mad at her dad but I definitely think she needs therapy and maybe you can find a therapist to recommend to her to help with this trama but your definitely nta and neither is your dad.", "NTA- taking on just one child as a full time single parent can be overwhelming. It\u2019s understandable if he believed he couldn\u2019t take on another child, let alone one which wasn\u2019t his. \n\nEveryone who was actually responsible for your sister, failed her. She has a right so be angry and she sees that you had a good childhood so needs someone to blame.", "NTA \nYour dad never raised her. She came after your parents split. He has/had no obligation to take her.", "NTA, but she really should be unloading on her bio family.", "NTA. Tell her that she needs to take all that anger, find her real father, and pass it to him. He was the one responsible for her. His family should have stepped up to take care of her. If she can't place the blame on the right person, she can stay away.", "Sorry about your mom.\n\nYou - NTA.  Of course you would stick up for your dad against a half sibling you barely know.\n\nYour dad - NTA.  From his perspective, your half sister is just another guy\u2019s baby via his ex wife.  There should be zero expectation that he would form any relationship with your half sister, much less raise her as his own kid.\n\nYour half sis - NTA.  I mean, technically she is being a dick to you by harassing you about your dad.  And you wouldn\u2019t be wrong to just cut her out of your life.  But you can see why she would be jealous of you and, assuming she never got with a loving foster family, she\u2019s probably pretty fucked up emotionally.  She\u2019s behaving like an AH, but I can\u2019t blame her.\n\nYour mom\u2019s family - YTA, slightly.  Someone on your mom\u2019s side of the family should have stepped up for your half sis.\n\nYour half sis dad - 100% shit covered asshole.  He is the real reason for your half sis\u2019s problems.  It\u2019s horrible when a guy won\u2019t step up and be a dad.  It\u2019s child abandonment and should result in jail time if he refuses to take responsibility and the state has to step in to raise the child.", "NTA.  You set the record straight.  Further contact with her will be unpleasant and unrewarding for you.", "NTA. I feel for the girl; having your mom die and end up in foster care must have been horrible for her. \n\nBut your dad wasn\u2019t her dad. They never knew each other, and she wasn\u2019t his to take care of. It sucks, yes, but it doesn\u2019t make your dad a bad person.", "Nta\n\nYour parents were split up when she had half sibling, and being unable to get in touch with any of the father's family makes me think your mom didn't even have any info on him. So she is in no way your father's responsibility, he took care of his responsibility, you. \n\nShe's mad at the wrong person, she needs to track down either her father's family, or be mad at her mother's family. \n\nYou should block her, she made her intentions clear that she just wants to hurt you and your father. That message could *legally* be taken as a threat and you might want to look into a restraining order.", "NTA. She needs serious therapy. Block her on everything but keep her messages as receipts if you need it for evidence in case she tries something.", "If I understand you correctly, your dad is not her father and never had any custody of her. She's just his ex's kid. \n\nNTA. He's not her dad. She never lived with him. He had no connection to her. He was already a single parent to you, why would he be obligated to adopt another kid? I can understand her being resentful about it, but it's completely unreasonable for her to try to turn you against him. Also she reached out to you... 20 years later? And is acting like she's supposed to be the most important person in your life?", "She should direct that hate at her own father who was Actually responsible. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour Father had no responsibility to your half sister. Why would he take on a child that wasn't his. \n\nI understand her bitterness that you were brought up in a loving home while she was in Foster Care and that is sad. But your Dad was not responsible for her.\n\nIf she had come to you and been nicer perhaps you could have formed a relationship, but she approached your Dad and you with such bile and venom, she burnt that bridge.\n\nSuch a shame the Foster system didn't help her find her Bio Dad.", "Her anger should be directed at mums side of family or the father, definitely not your father, she needs counselling and support but you can't help her if she is being so nasty to your father", "A good dad, her actual dad, should have definitely stepped up.  She is mad at the wrong person. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA - Your dad didnt do anything wrong, HER dad did.", "NTA there are 10s of other people she should be furious with before your father. If she was 2 then that\u2019s a prime chance at being adopted and probably having a better life than he was about to give his ex\u2019s new child. \n\nBesides, she\u2019s what 22 now? She needs some therapy and none of that responsibility is on either of you.\n\n\u201cYou should feel xyz way\u201d is the fastest way to get someone not to feel that way", "NTA. Your sister is projecting everything she should be saying to HER DAD onto yours.Your dad isnt the AH, HER DAD IS. Its not your fault or your dads fault that her dad was completely never in her life. She needs therapy.", "Does she know you don't share the same dad? cause the way you make her sound, it seems like she thinks your dad is her dad, but I could also be reading more into it than I should", "NTA leaning a bit towards NAH. What makes her an AH in my eyes was this part\n\n>will turn me against him if it's the last thing she does because I need my eyes opened.\n\nHer trauma is not your trauma. Clearly she's had a very hard time. That's not your cross to bear, and it's unfair to expect you to hate your father on her behalf, regardless of whether or not it was right or wrong to not take her in. \n\nIf you continue building a relationship with her I would be careful to set some very strong boundaries around this. Be compassionate but firm, make it extremely clear you will not discuss this topic any further. Avoid saying things like you don't care, though. \"I'm sorry for what you went through. I understand your feelings about Dad, but they don't change mine. I can't be the support you're looking for on this topic. I love you and would like to continue talking, but if you bring this up again I will end the conversation.\"", "Since he had zero relationship with her would he even be able to take her in legally?", "NTA\n\nBut damn that poor toddler\n\nThis story is all too common I wish those people that hate abortion and say \u201cthis is what child support is for\u201d would look at these stories. Men who abandon kids like this should be charged with misdemeanors or something.", "Life failed your sister-  her dad was useless,  her mother dies, and all her other family abandoned her. \n\nEven as a half sibling you are indifferent to her.  \n\nLike everyone in her life just sucks.   She is angry at the world and she has the right to be.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she can dump her trauma on you.  She is deeply hurt and looking for a connection,  but it isn\u2019t an excuse. \n\nI really hope she finds a family that loves her and accepts her.\n\nEdit: My judgement is NAH.  You are not responsible for her, neither is your dad.  \n\nA small acknowledgment of her pain and suffering would be kind.  She is a bit of your mom that is still in the world.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks so bad and so hard for her, truly. But it isn't remotely your or your father's responsibility.\n\nNobody is morally obligated to set themselves on fire to keep anyone else warm. \n\nI hope your sister gets therapy.. She needs it.", "NTA.  This poor child was abandoned by everyone in her life.  It was not your father's responsibility to raise her.  Her family failed her, not you or your dad.  She is lashing out.  Protect your peace.", "She is out to revenge and she is aiming at everybody including the innocent ones. She might be jealousy too and was out to destroy the relationship you share with your dad. She needs therapy.", "NTA - I really do emphasis with your half sister, seems like no one gave a shit about her and left her to rot. That isn\u2019t your fault since you were only a child and wasn\u2019t his fault since he\u2019s not related to her. I\u2019m shocked no one in your mother\u2019s family took her in or at least checked on her in foster care. Especially since we all know what the foster system is like. \n\nMy situation is similar to a certain extent. I was raised solely by my mother and my dad was a deadbeat. He decided to find me as an adult and was a waste of space. Only positive that came out of it was that I found my younger sister.\n\nShe had a similar experience with my dad but decided to still have a relationship with him. She tried to get me to see him saying he changed but I told her I wasn\u2019t interested. I had to place boundaries and tell her not to speak about him again to me otherwise I was going NC with her. It worked and we now have a great relationship.\n\nThe reason I say this is because you need to put boundaries in if you want a relationship with her too. She definitely needs therapy to deal with her issues. It\u2019s understandable that she feels life is unfair since you got a family and she didn\u2019t. Unfortunately that is life and she needs to move on if she wants a future.", "I\u2019m going to guess that her actual father still cannot be found so she is going after your father because he is around.

That would be difficult... but I personally would consider taking in my kids half-sister.  \n\nSadly, your half sister resents someone who is essentially unrelated to her in any real way. Pops aint blood. His only connection is through you.  \n\nWhere you both living with your dad when your mom died? What reasoning does she have that he should've taken her in.  \n\nYou are N T A for sure - but I do understand the pain she feels. And in a n ideal world, your pops also takes her in. But life doesn't spin that way. Maybe the divorce was bad and this is honestly just some random kid to him. \n\nGood luck- rough stuff to deal with.", "NTA. Your sister probably had a tough childhood and is resentful of that, but her resentment is entirely misplaced, and her intent to destroy your relationship with your dad is unhealthy and weird. If she wants to blame someone, her biological father is the only person that is eligible. Your father had no obligation and focused on his own child. Given your ages, I imagine most people would do the same.", "NTA.  She's directing her hatred at the wrong man.  She had a dad who abandoned her. It just wasn't your dad.", "NTA. Why would your dad take in a complete stranger to him simply because you two share some dna. You didn\u2019t have a bond with her. She never knew you and you barely remember her.

Plus it likely comes with a bunch of legal hurdles, he would probably have had to adopt her etc, because she's not related to him. It's not as straightforward as him just taking her in, and it wasn't his job to 'save her'. \n\nIt sounds like she's angry at the life she was dealt, understandably, but her anger is misdirected. She shouldn't be mad at a man who is unrelated to her, and she shouldn't be mad at you, who was just a child at the time. The blame falls on her own dad for disappearing. I think she needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nWithout really knowing half sisters situation I would hesitate to comment on her.

To be clear there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, family is more than blood and blood doesn't necessarily = family.\n\nSome of the comments here are wild.

My half sister was 2 at the time and her dad was not in her life. My dad took full custody of me (he shared custody with mom when she was alive). My half sister was sent to a foster family because none of mom's family were fit to take her and they couldn't get in touch with her dad or any of his family. I can't say I ever really missed her. I knew about her but I didn't really love her back then so I never had any guilt for being raised in a loving home with my dad and stepmom while she was in foster care. We had two visits arranged by CPS in the first year after mom died but then those stopped.\n\nShe reached out to me a year ago via DMs and we have communicated a bit through there. She found my dad through social media recently and told him he was a disgusting shit and her not being his shouldn't have meant separating us and not caring about her. She told him a real good dad would have taken her because they loved me and couldn't stand the thought of an innocent little kid in foster care. She told him she would celebrate when he dies and will turn me against him if it's the last thing she does because I need my eyes opened.\n\nI found out about what happened and told her if she was going to try and turn me against my dad then she doesn't need to talk to me again. She went through how shitty she feels he was for letting her go into foster care and how a good person, a good dad, a good man, would have saved her. She told me I should hate him for what he did. I told her I didn't care that he refused to raise her. That it wasn't his job to. She asked how I could be so cruel and cold about this because we're siblings and I should adore her and want the best for her. She kind of lost it in DMs honestly so I muted her for a while and she kept sending them calling me all kinds of names.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Of course you\u2019re going to defend him despite his flaws.\n\nThis is just such a mess and I honestly feel for everyone involved.

We have no idea what she went through in the foster system, and I know how much resentment I felt watching my brothers\u2019 father pay for their private education (K-12) while my dad refused even basic child support and I struggled in a middle to lower-income public school. There were many other discrepancies as well, even though my mom really tried to do her best. Now, I love my family, I\u2019m at peace with the differences.

My advice is that, while you are completely NTA, if you are interested in a future relationship with her, you can meet her with kindness and understanding. Consider speaking with a professional to help work through this so you can draw boundaries \u2014 like \u201cI know you\u2019re in pain but it\u2019s not acceptable for you to speak to or about my father that way\u201d \u2014 and also move forward together.\n\nBest of luck OP.

Yes, he could have hypothetically tried to get custody of her. But that would have been an adoption decision between him and your stepmother. And there was absolutely no obligation for him to do so. But a child who is trying to survive might not see that. And while she is an adult now, shaking that would likely need a lot of therapy.\n\nI really do feel for your sister because of just how horrendous the system is. And depending on location of the foster system she was in, she very likely could have been treated like a pay check at best. This is a moment where practiced patience and empathy would be helpful if you want to become her support system. And I hope you do, but you also do not have to and that would not make you an AH. So don\u2019t worry about that. It\u2019s just a very sad situation. And while her anger is misdirected, she has every right to be angry (just not at both of you).", "Well, there are 2 views to look at this. \n1. The literal view: NTA. Your dad had no obligation to your half-sister. Therefore, he did nothing wrong by not taking her in and letting her go to faster care while keeping you. You did nothing wrong by going with your father.\n2. The moral view. YTA. Your dad may not have been her father, but it was known that she is your sister, and she had nobody to take her in. If there was no other reason he couldn't take her in such as finances or laws preventing him, he could have recognized that she's your sister and innocent and deserves to grow up with her brother in a loving home. You being her brother, it sounds like you didn't even give her a second thought. Maybe it's because you were young, but most siblings want to stay together. So it's understandable she is angry that she was abandoned by her own brother, and she feels like she does knowing you were taken care of while she was nothing more than an afterthought to people. Morally speaking, just because we don't have to do something doesn't mean we should do nothing.", "So your half sister wasn't biologically his when your mom died. What if my brother's ex died and her sons' dads and his side were not fit to take her sons who are my nephews half siblings.

But luckily you were not attached to your sister at that age when you both got separated. \n\nYou are NTA and neither is your father. Your sister's anger is misplaced.

I can give you our families situation.\nMy dad was an only child and his father was there.  He was an awful father but my Dad valued family.  So he kept trying.  He never did anything or say anything against his father. His parents finally divorced.  His dad found god and remarried to a lovely woman.  My parents would go to visit.  We kids saw him maybe twice in 20 years.  He had 3 more sons whom he was the perfect parent.  When my brother was on leave and was going to be in the area when old man lived. My dad told him to stop by to see him.  My brother goes to the door - the old man greets him with \u201cwho the hell are you\u201d.  My brother says \u201cI\u2019m your grandson\u201d and left. Fast forward - the old man has a heart attack.  My dad drags my brothers to the hospital.  The old man is asking \u201cfor his sons\u201d.  My Dad leaned over and said \u201cI\u2019m your son you sob, I hope you die and rot in hell\u201d and left, the old man died, of course no one went to the service. My dad was close to one of the sons btw.  A couple years ago he found me on facebook.  We would call and share photos. Then I get a call, he\u2019s ranting about what a bad son my dad was, he never attended the funeral and his dad was perfect.  As you can imagine, it didn\u2019t go well.\nSorry for the long response.  But your half sister will not let this go.  After years she\u2019s working herself up to crazy town. Because someone may be related doesn\u2019t mean you have to love them.  You need to cut her out of any association with your family.  Tell her if she even thinks of contacting your Dad you will turn her in for elder abuse.

That said, you should be more sensitive to your sister\u2019s situation. Yes, her words were brutal, and her anger is misplaced at your dad, but she still has valid reasons behind her feelings. Foster care is just awful for most kids, and your sister very likely went through things worse than you have ever experienced, will ever experience, and could ever imagine. It\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s feeling so hurt, angry, and broken. You grew up in a home with parents and love, whereas she was basically tossed out with the trash at just two years old and had to grow up knowing nobody in her life wanted her. You, as her own sister, getting to grow up free of that trauma simply feels like an extra deep wound on top of a lifetime of scars.", "Sounds like she actually thinks your dad is her dad, are you sure she hasn't been lied to her whole life?", "NTA. Yet, I would caution you about completely cutting her out of your life forever. \n\nRight now, she has a shit ton of displaced anger on your dad (it's *her biological father* & your mother she's angry at) and probably feels resentment and anger towards you feeling that you had a much better life than she did (which is probably true although **not your fault or the fault of your dad**).  I'd be honest with her. You were 4 and had no control over the situation, you're sorry her life has been so awful, but **that does not give her the right to harm other people.** She's very young, both chronologically and emotionally. Trauma does that to a person. \n\nI suggest you consider the possibility of being open to a relationship with her **after** she has worked past her anger issues regarding your dad. Yes, you're half-siblings, but you owe her nothing. If she can be a positive in your life, foster the relationship,  if she can't,  you're doing the right thing. \n\nA word of caution, though. She seems like an incredibly **angry** young woman hell bent on \"righting\" the wrongs done to her. She probably will take your boundaries as further rejection which can increase and redirect her anger towards you.", "NAH - Your poor sister. I imagine that she\u2019s had a really hard life to be so angry at you and your father. But, you and your father have done nothing wrong.

But your dad didn\u2019t have any part in raising her prior to your mother\u2019s death. \n\nNTA but you won the daddy lottery and she didn\u2019t.

It sounds like he couldn't be bothered to worry about them having a relationship and didn't care about a kid in the system. That's messed up.\n\nThe sister is understandably upset and jealous. A life in the system is no life at all and and when you have siblings that go to a family while you're stuck in foster care, that stings. (I have direct personal knowledge of this.) However that is no excuse to threaten to ruin OP's relationship with the father. She clearly needs to work past the abandonment issues and perhaps talk to the people who most clearly failed her, her moms family, who definitely suck.\n\nAnd finally OP. Who clearly doesn't care about this person or what she went through. You don't have to be friends with her, especially since seems toxic and destructive, but the callous disregard gives sociopath vibes.

A family can absolutely take in a half-sibling of a child they have custody of, even with no biological relationship between the petitioner and the child.\n\nEvery single child custody law, *except* NICWA, includes the phrase, 'the best interest of the child.' What is the best interest of the child? A stable, clean home with their family. Or, a stable, clean home with someone who wants them. If their half-sibling's family will take them in and there is no other family asking the court for custody and the other option is foster care, the half-sibling is family and being raised with their sibling is in the best interest of the child. They might even pick step or half with no biological relationship over bio family, if it is in the best interests of the child. Aunt they never met, or staying with the half-brother they've been raised with until now? Best interest of the child could be argued as a familiar environment. Not losing every family member they know.\n\nHeck, people have been given custody of their neighbor's children, their friend's children. If no family is available or capable, courts don't really care *who* is taking in a child, as long as they pass CPS inspections.\n\nOne of my coworkers got guardianship and then later adopted his son's best friend.

My gut says the mother had a ONS/didn't know the father", "Why do you think she *isn\u2019t* angry and every fucking adult who failed her?", "Exactly. I think there's more to this than OP is admitting. The \"I don't care\" and \"I never loved her\" comments are major read flags for me. My best friend works with troubled kids, most of whom are in foster care, and it is not an exaggeration of how horrible foster care is. 99% of foster parents are only doing it for the money, and they will fill their houses with as many kids as the law and CPS will allow them, which leads to overcrowding. If you're lucky, the foster parents are simply neglectful and ignore you as long as they get their checks. That's a best case scenario. The worst case is emotional and physical, and more often than anyone thinks sexual abuse. Also, due to the overcrowding, it's not uncommon for kids to be abused, especially sexually, by other, usually older, foster kids living in the house. All of this is on top of the emotional trauma of being abandoned by your family, moved from foster home to foster home because no one wants you and for many thrown out on the street on their 18th birthday because that's when the checks stop for foster parents so the kids are no use to them. There's a reason so many kids who grew up in foster care end up addicted to drugs, or turn to crime, or are prone to violence or anger, etc. It's hard to be or even care to be productive members of society when you've spent your whole life feeling like society didn't want you. Is this girls anger misplaced? Absolutely, but OP's lack of any kind of sensitivity or compassion OP is showing is alarming. This girl most likely had a horrible childhood in which she, at best, felt abandoned and unloved and, at worst, suffered some kind of abuse. She's 22 now and who knows what she's been through since turning 18, she can't find her real dad or bio family but she found OP and sees the life they had and is probably feeling resentful that they had a better life so she's lashing out. It's common for people to lash out at people they're jealous or resentful of, even if it's not logical or warranted. OP was raised in a safe, loving environment, little sis was not, and it's hard for anyone, yet alone a 22 year old to not feel resentful regardless of whether it's deserved or not.

My mom worked with CPS, my sister ran a shelter battered women (later DV shelter, they at first put men and their children in hotels and then opened a co-ed facility) and runaway/ throwaway youth. Family placement can be very loosely defined because reunification is the ultimate goal of every single foster care system and CPS. Yes, individual actors can be bad, there are horror stories, people fall through the cracks. Generally, they are overwhelmed and a placement with a sibling the kid already knows is always going to be an option unless the home is unsafe by CPS standards for a placement, which are usually less strict for family placement than a foster placement. (Ie, shared bedrooms for kids that foster care in general wouldn't allow is often fine for family placement.) \n\nThey track down family and ship kids all over the country to people they have never met. Sibling placements are common, even to adults they never met. \"Congrats! Your half-sister that you never met lives in Oregon! Her dad will take you in.

Amtrak sends 'em off.\n\nThey will do just about anything to take the strain off the pool of available foster care homes and keep kids out of group facilities.\n\nMy county has full-time employees who basically just research family to find family placements and take kids out of the general foster care system.

And maybe the only thing that got her through was the fantasy that her \u201cbrother\u201d would have helped her if he knew.\n\nAnd now, she knows brother dgaf either.\n\nSuch a shitty hand to be dealt in life out of no fault of hers\u2026abandoned at 2. Failed and failed and failed again. Just awful.", "They try to keep them together when adopting both kids. Op wasnt adopted their father had custody already\n\n\nThis would literally be the courts handing a toddler off with a total stranger with no relationship to them. Also a single male.\n\nThe context is a big deal and changes the way a court would look at this\n\n\nThis all is only a thing if ops dad decided he MUST have this random little girl he never met for some reason and was willing to fight to make it happen", "Seriously.. breaks my heart even more for the sister. What a crap situation she was put in by her parents.", "I don't think it was OP's dad's responsibility to raise her, and my vote is still NTA here, but I do think OP's dad failed *OP* and his sister by not doing what he could to maintain a relationship between his child and their sibling. OP was too young to understand anything when it happened, and the reason he is so disinvested now is because he has virtually no relationship with this girl. I think that was a robbery for both kids, but especially OP's half sister. I think it was a callousness, intentional or not, that she did not deserve to be denied even the chance at a relationship with her brother.", "Personally, I would be a little more sympathetic than OP and been more diplomatic in redirecting where her anger should be. It's certainly not his dad's fault, but she's been through hell, maybe he could cut her some slack?", "Where specifically are you getting that OP rubbed it in her face? \n\nGiven how shitty she was to OP\u2019s dad and how she claimed she could turn OP against his own dad, I can understand why OP didn\u2019t coddle her right then. She was waaaaay out of line and OP was right to stand up for his dad. \u201cYou should adore me and give up your dad for me because we grew in the same uterus\u201d is fucking unhinged. OP should block her and move on with his life.", "This is true. But her half sibling and their dad didnt abandon her. She built up a fantasy based on nothing, and repeatedly lashed out when it turned out to not be true. OP doesnt have to accept that as a penance for having a family growing up? And OP very well may have been interested to cultivate a relationship, but half sis demanding not only a relationship, but demanding OP turn their back on their father is absolutely unhinged shit. I feel for her, but she doesnt get to lash out at them and they just calmly eat it. It sucks all around but half sis just created this fantasty in her mind instead of seemingly trying to take steps for herself. Im very aware of how many kids fall through the cracks, and i do not imagine her life was remotely easy. But she is looking to take an easy way to get family, which also\u2026 does not actually work.", "If she\u2019s like most kids who grew up in foster care unfortunately, she won\u2019t be able to afford the therapy she really needs.", "Why wasn\u2019t she adopted. That was my first thought because a healthy not abused 2 yo would normally get snatched up fast.", "Yeah, aren't there rules regarding who can adopt a child w.r.t relatives and unrelated family members. OP's dad probably wasn't even on the list.", "He could have asked (and likely would have been given custody if nobody else was around) and was likely told she was going into foster care as he had the half-sibling.\n\nHowever, while it would have been kind and caring to do so, it was not his responsibility, nor was he obligated to do so, nor is he uncaring for not doing it. He may have felt bad for the other little girl, even.\n\nFor all we know, the only reason OP had the good life was because there was only one kid in the home.\n\nRaising kids is really expensive, and not being able to take in multiple children full-time at the drop of a hat doesn't make you a bad person.", "OP says they couldn't get in touch with the bio-dad or his family.  I've seen this happen before -- little kids that should be easily adoptable have a bio-parent who ran out on them and moved away from the area.  If they are working under the table or doing less savory sorts of things (or trying to avoid paying child support), they don't always have a paper/IRS trail to follow and CPS is too understaffed to hunt them down across state lines if a cursory search doesn't turn them up.  It's sad for OP's sister that her bio-dad's family never took on any responsibility for her, but it wasn't the responsibility of OP's father.", "Thats my thought, too. A healthy 2 year old who doesn't have an abuse history and is fully adoptable because there are no family ties should have been snatched up almost immediately. Especially in a foster to adopt situation.", "It was possibly CPS\u2019s fault she wasn\u2019t adopted. The could have been trying for reunification too hard with the biological family to where she never could be adopted. I\u2019ve seen situations where shitty parents/grandparents were given years and years to try to be good enough to take custody or even  kids returned to shitty family over and over again never given the opportunity to be adopted.", "Also, CPS could find her biological father very easily.", "I saw something shocking [on Twitter yesterday about adoptive parents \"rehoming\" kids](https://twitter.com/corsent/status/1735155955648647591) just really...super casually? It took me aback that this would be allowed.", "This is not about blame, this is about someone stating that courts would have decided to separate the siblings had OPs father wanted to keep the girl.", "I am curious about this scenario although I understand you may not know and/or different locations would have different laws.\n\nIf a biological parent can be shown to have known they are a parent, and as far as can be determined, they intentionally made themselves unable to be found, can their parental rights be severed so the child can be adopted? \n\nI am guessing that because her biological father was unavailable to give his permission for OP\u2019s half sister to be adopted, it never happened. That sucks for the life she could have had, the family that could have loved her, and the foster placement slot that could have gone to another child in need.", "The child wasn't an orphan. She had a father, even if social services didn't know where he was. That means they were required by law to proceed slowly, while attempting to find him and seeing if placement with him or another family member would be possible. They can't just instantly sever a noncustodial father's parental rights just because he's not easy to locate. \n\nWe also don't know the whole story. There may have been other factors that would affect adoption prospects.  For instance, there are a lot more families eagerly awaiting white babies than children of color. Babies with special needs, such as even a minor medical condition, are hard to place even when adoptive parents are promised that the medical needs will always be covered for free by Medicare and there will be a stipend for the family.\n\nAlso, the adult version of this child clearly has strong anger issues. If she was showing anger issues even as a child, it would have quickly reduced her prospects of adoption. It's unfair, because of course suddenly losing a mother and a sister would confuse and anger a small child who doesn't know about grief or regulating emotions. But unfortunately having a history works against them like that unless a family can be found that is willing to adopt a child who might always have a lot of anger about the traumas her young life was subjected to. Which is how families end up choosing a newborn over the ~4 year old (by the time a court can sever the father's rights in absentia) that's full of rage.", "In my experience working in the system years ago, that is often not true. They are obliged to attempt to find him for a long while before his rights can be severed without his knowledge. But CPS is severely underfunded. They do not have the resources to dig under every rock. They do their due diligence, but the reality is that it's a crapshoot whether it leads to finding someone. Also sometimes it leads to a morgue or a prison cell. So even when the search pans out, it's no guarantee that they find someone capable of taking custody.", "Once they are adopted, they\u2019re legally their kids and they can do what they want. It happened to our adopted daughter\u2019s half brother. His grandparents took him, didn\u2019t want her cuz she wasn\u2019t related to them. They weren\u2019t sure they could raise a young child. We offered to adopt him too so he and our daughter could grow up together. They adopted him after all and then adopted him out to people they knew so they didn\u2019t have to raise him but could still see him. DHS was pissed but legally he was their child after adoption so they couldn\u2019t do anything.", "And its highly unlikely a court would allow a single man with no relationship to the child take custody"]}
