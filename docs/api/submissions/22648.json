This restriction can be lifted by the breeder and is usually done 1) if the dog has had all breed specific health and genetic tests and found to be hereditary clear/not a carrier for conditions AND is a good temperament.

He doesn\u2019t have a say once that puppy becomes your property (dogs are considered property in many places). Some breeders will write it into their contracts that they may want to use the dog for breeding purposes. Again, this is subject to the dog being clear of hereditary issues and being a good temperament. The breeder may also choose to not use the dog for breeding and most breeders will keep dogs they wish to use for breeding rather than sell them, or give them to members of the appropriate breed club that they know personally. \n\nI will say though in regards to spaying, with large breed dogs, let them fully mature. Many studies now show that spaying and neutering once growth plates have fully closed is best at preventing hip and elbow dysplasia as well as preventing certain types of cancer. Some owners will also leave their dogs intact and never intend to breed them, so maybe wait until your GSD is at least 18 months old, possibly 2 years. \n\nIn regards to the harassment, report them.

Hip dysplasia is one of the biggest issues with GSD, so a breeder ignoring the standard for that is a huge red flag.\n\nA good breeder *might* want to retain breeding rights to a puppy that passes out of their kennel. This would have an *extensive* conversation and only to a pet owner they knew and trusted, not just a random person who shows up to purchase a puppy from their litter. It likely would be accompanied by a contract signed by both parties, as well as a significant discount in the puppies price as you are buying something without all of the rights- similar to discounts when buying a property but specifically not getting the air or mining rights, or if there's an easement on the property. The new owner wouldn't be surprised by these plans later. The breeder would also keep the new owner fully involved in any conversations about planning a litter useing their dog.\n\nFor anyone increasing demand by buying purebred puppies, please look into breed standards for what health tests to ask for. OFA tests for hip and elbow health is common in many large breed dogs, but some breeds will have more specific tests for things (like heart or eye issues) that are common in the breed.

Dogs won\u2019t just magically start being born with proper features. The deformities have been bred into their genetics. The only way to fix the problem is to carefully breed the problem back out.

Doing this over several generations will keep extending the muzzle until it\u2019s back to how it\u2019s supposed to be. Not only will this fix the breathing issues, but it will also help with the issue that pugs have with their bulging eyes that can\u2019t close properly.\n\nWhat these breeders are doing to fix the breeds is not only good, but absolutely necessary to fix the multitude of problems that moronic people have decided look better for show dogs. Unfortunately it\u2019s happening to German Shepards as well, with show breeders specifically breeding them to have shorter back legs because the inbred shitheels that judge show dogs have decided that a sloping back looks better than a straight one.

That puppy was one of three males available to companion homes, including the boy I bought. She was upfront with me about what happened and explained that he would possibly have some issues with that leg as he grew older. For that reason, even though he was available, she strongly discouraged me from taking him as she preferred that he go to someone she knew well and who lived close by so she would be readily available to help with him as he aged.
