You are a great dog parent and I respect you and the care you show your dog.\n\nAs their person it is on us completely to protect them because they don\u2019t have a voice.

When you do you stunt their growth, it's better get it done once they are done growing.

So you would be the ah for that but not for refusing to have her bred.", "NTA. as you said, he has no say in what you do with your dog.  There was no contract stating she would be bred, he was trying to bully you into doing what he wanted. Good for you for standing your ground and defending your pup.

Usually, when you buy registered pups, you have to sign something agreeing *not* to breed the puppies. If you didn't sign anything stating that you would allow your dog to be used for breeding purposes, you don't owe him anything.\n\nAnd what was he going to do, make your dog have puppies that you raise to selling age and then he sells them for a profit? Or would have have taken your pregnant dog from you, had her give birth in a cage, and then give her back once the puppies are weaned?
