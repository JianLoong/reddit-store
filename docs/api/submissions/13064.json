Long story short he always put his friends before family and he also had a problem with alcohol. His ex gave plenty of opportunities to put her and their young daughter first but obviously she got tired of waiting for him to grow up and she became linked with another guy and they ended up together.\n\nSo fast forward a year or so and James and his ex were at least borderline civil up to this point. James started dating again and met my now SIL. SIL had a few boys from her previous relationship and got into my brothers ear about how he shouldn't treat his 3yo daughter and different to her boys. \n\nAnyway SIL started to \"coach\" my brother about how he should interact with his ex and that the rest of his family should only see his daughter during his days he had her because there were no court orders in place between him and his ex. This is where the tensions started rising between him and the family. I personally watched him walk down the aisle of a shopping centre when his daughter and ex were there and he completely ignored her. I sat down and said you don't have to like your ex but you have to atleast be civil for your daughter, as did our older brothers and parents. \n\nSo after a month or so my elder brother had his 2 yr olds bday party and didn't invite my brothers then gfs sons as A) he had never met  her and B) they were all significantly older then his son and he thought why would they want to come to a 2yr olds party? \n\nSo after this the fallouts started beginning and eventually i was told to fuck off with the rest of the family. Me being me basically said righto mate whatever. Every so often I'd get an abusive text message one of which he claimed to have made the last effort to be civil by contacting me which i didnt respond to. I replied with you're right, If I recall you told me to get fucked and never talk to you again, so why would I bother replying, the common denominator seems to be you, none of us turned our back on you? No response.\n\nSo anyway fast forward 6 or so years and he has slowly started talking with my brothers and parents but never actually apologised. I said he owes people an apology, and if they want to take a no harm no foul approach and sweep the behaviour under the rug that's their choice and I get it. My mother told me one of us has to be the bigger person and extend an olive branch but I honestly don't see why it should be me. She says I'm just being stubborn and I should move on.\n\nBut am I the asshole for holding him accountable and wanting him to apologise for the way he treated everyone for the better half of a decade? My mindset is if I roll over he will always portray himself as the victim, and that it's OK he brushes everyone the next time someone says something he doesn't like, because we'll just let the behaviour slide.", "created_utc": 1679640580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120bxix/aita_for_not_sweeping_my_brothers_behaviour_under/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You yourself, may find yourself outside of family stuff though. \n\nI know of someone whose brother was a bad 'un'. Family let him back in and after many years he seems okay. But my friend just won't do anything with him. He's done with his brother.

You did nothing wrong, and your mom sounds like she cares more about having your brother present than she does about him being abusive to you. Which is shitty. Also, I assume you\u2019re all adults, so y\u2019all get to act like it. You get to act like an adult by choosing how you\u2019re treated by the people you spend time around, and your brother gets to be treated like an adult and feel the consequences of his actions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After that, ignore or redirect any arguments about bigger people, bygones, finding Jesus, extending branches etc.  \n\nApology, even an insincere one for social reasons, requires only three words and some sort of admission of wrongdoing.

You are allowed to have feelings and boundaries.", "NTA and I'd say..  Mom... you are being stubborn, James is being stubborn so why are you calling me out for that? Somebody has to be the bigger person and you're going to hold me to that? So that means that you know I'm right but you want me to get over it.  Well, good thing for you is that I will, sort of.... right after he apologizes.  And let's be clear- it's an apology that lists his transgressions so we know what he's apologizing for AND there are no buts in it.  His refusal to acknowledge what he's done is him denying that he did anything wrong. Well, I'm not signing on to that delusion."]}
