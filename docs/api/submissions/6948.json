OP...\n\nSo your daughter made fun of the fact that Caucasian descent and African descent have different hair types.  So she was as a result, making fun of their background and their race. Does she necessarily *realize* it and all the implications of it? No, not necessarily. But is race as a concept something she's old enough to start being aware of and of the history in this space? Yes.\n\nSo the argument you made, that she just didn't know, doesn't really matter, because you-are-different-and-thus-suck-more-also-this-time-the-difference-is-part-of-your-race... well, that's an attack and judgment on race. Which if someone said: ew, I don't like SilentSeaweed24. She dresses funny and lives in a trailer. Well, that's making fun of my class. That's a *classist* statement. So, you know, your daughter... made a *racist* statement.\n\nDefinition wise, it's what your daughter did. So saying your daughter didn't do the definition of what she did... and then the other mom calling you out for the fact that your daughter didn't put 2 and 2 together, so she shouldn't be punished, well that means you didn't put two and two together either.

Also, in colloquial language we interchange racism with bigotry all the time. \n\nMaybe you and your daughter feel like you don't carry the full hatred and vitriol in your heart that a \"true\" racist would, however:  Your daughter, per your words, was bullying someone else via assertion that an innate feature of her particular race was \"wiry and gross\". Using her position as bully, the one in power, to say something bigoted to a protected class will get you exactly as your daughter received.

She was picking on her because she is Black with natural hair. Can you imagine the conversation the other girl's parents are having to have with her? Imagine how she might feel about her hair now, when she was already standing out as being one of the few (only?) Black kids in her school, and being shamed for her hair for being different. I can imagine, because I was that child. I started chemically straightening my hair to fit in with my mostly white peers around that age, getting burns on my scalp every few weeks so my hair would be straight. \n\nAnd beyond the fact that it was an inappropriate thing to say, why did she say it was gross? Not different, but *gross*? That's such a nasty, hurtful word to use. \n\nAlso, your daughter is 13. Unless y'all live in the woods with no TV/internet, she's seen Black people before.

If you do want your daughter to do racist things, keep explaining that it wasn't *really* racist.", "Sorry, I understand defending your daughter but YTA. Unintentional racism is still racism. The difference is this is a learning opportunity for your daughter.", "YTA. Your daughter said something cruel about a classmate's appearance, and instead of turning it into a learning moment, you doubled down and tried to excuse it.\n\nIgnorance on her part doesn't lesson the pain caused by the racist comment. If I accidentally drop a hammer on someone's foot, it doesn't hurt any less than if I dropped it on purpose.", "YTA. Your daughter is in a school, where she gets exposed to a myriad of things every day, and she chose to make that comment. She was, absolutely, racist in doing so.", "YTA. Face facts, your daughter did say something racist.", "YTA. Her hair was \"wiry and gross\" is an unacceptable way to refer to ANYONE'S hair. And the fact you are trying to excuse it shows you are either clueless, or worse racist.", "YTA. I don\u2019t care where you live, as a parent it\u2019s your job to expose her to other races, religions, sexualities etc. You\u2019ve clearly already dropped that ball, don\u2019t make it worse by trying to negate what she did. Use it as a teachable moment. Teach her why it is wrong to comment negatively about anyone\u2019s appearance, but most especially a black girls hair, given the mountain of cultural baggage there. Teach her about unconscious bias, the CROWN Act and racial profiling. Teach about red lining and restrictive covenants\u2014 find out if your suburb had one.  If you try to sweep this under the rug, not only will you be an asshole, you\u2019ll be doing a grave disservice to your child.", "YTA. Ignorance is not an excuse for racist behaviour. Her comments were racist. Perhaps (and I\u2019m being charitable here), she didn\u2019t intend it as such but she did do it to be mean and hurtful and it was based on racial differences.\n\nTBH, if my kid was found to be bullying another kid, I wouldn\u2019t be defending them on that. The school, and the parent, have come up with an appropriate consequence and, as a parent, I would be happy to reinforce that consequence and have continuing conversations about appropriate behaviour.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter \"othered\" someone for having a different physical appearance than her own.
