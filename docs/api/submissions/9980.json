She's just a sibling saying ludicrous things to be mean.  Htf does she know how dirty your hands are??", "ESH. Her jabs about privilege were obnoxious, but saying someone is poor because they are lazy is both cruel and reductive. You grew up in the same household, but did you have the same experiences and traumas? The same social environment? The same acceptance or stigmatization from peers, teachers, the education system as a whole? The same mental health status and learning abilities/disabilities? The same network and support?\n\nYou know that the reasons your sister struggles are complex and multifactorial, I'm sure, but you said something really vicious that you knew was not fair, just to get back at her.\n\nI get that her comments were really frustrating, but that doesn't give you licence to be cruel to someone and attack her to her very core. The adult way of handling this would be to have a mature conversation with her about these comments, not to lash out and hurl vicious insults.", "ESH\n\nYour comments about her dating habits *were* uncalled for (and also not relevant, even if true). She is being jealous. \n\nThe reason you have more money is because you make more money (\\*privilege\\* is an buzzword she is inaccurately throwing around, but she means privilegeD)", "ESH  Your sister sounds exhausting, but man, you were out for blood and bit a lot deeper.  Her remarks reflect maybe her envy at your situation, maybe feelings Iof disconnect from you.  What do yours reflect?  She worries you are superior or think you are superior because you make more money and says petty stuff definitely deserving of an eye roll and a sign, and your response was to  pass judgement and criticize who she is as a person.", "First of all people aren't poor because they want to, that's ignorant thinking, people should recognize that there just aren't the same opportunities, you were probably right to tell her that she can't expect to be rich by gloating with rich people, but she shouldn't have criticize things so small that they are \"privileges\"  YWNBTA", "ESH. Your sister shouldn't be making these remarks, but you shouldn't have gone off on her either. If it was bothering you, it would have been better to bring it up in a calm moment and ask her not to say these things again. And causing a scene in someone's home when they are offering you their hospitality is just incredibly rude.", "ESH. Your sister sounds extremely obnoxious and jealous of your money. At the same time, as you said, your comments were over the top and uncalled for. If I were you, I'd apologize for what you said and be happy about your financial security.", "QUESTION: If her snarky comments regarded you status as being POORER than she is, or than the average person, would you waste a minute worrying about whether you are the bad guy here?  NTA", "ESH.  Your sister has been absolutely obnoxious.  Especially things like the hand washing.  Wtf on that particular one, as long as people have enough money to keep their water turned on, hand hygiene is a thing people of all classes can be thorough or lackadaisical about.\n\nBut you decided to turn around and hit her where it hurts.  Instead of just being annoying in return, you were quite mean.", "While I sympathize with your plight, do you think your outburst accomplished anything positive? Anything but reaffirming your sister\u2019s victim attitude?\n\nESH", "Yta \n\nYou're right but still ah\n\nI don't blame you for snapping", "Tell her to just start an onlyfans tbh. IF she's looking for sugar daddies she might as well do that so at least she won't have to bang ugly rich dudes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: If she's ugly please disregard this comment.", "NAH.  Yep, your comments about her dating life were uncalled for. Her calling on your \u201cwashing your hands for too long\u201dwere uncalled for.  You two obviously have bigger issues than hand washing. \n\n\nYou\u2019ve moved up in society, she has not. Appreciate your sister for WHO SHE IS and (hopefully) vice versa.  Stop judging her, speak to her as a human, and ask her to stop judging you. \n\nSay \u201c I\u2019d like to be your friend, and sister.  I\u2019d like us to have a relationship. Let\u2019s both put aside aside our differences\u2026 we can be better than this\u201d.\n\nThis seriously worked for me. I thought I had an unsalvagable relationship with my judgmental sister.. until I said this.", "NTA. You gave her what she deserved. She shouldn't have poked the bear if she didn't want to hear it growl.", "NTA. Your sister has been spending too much time on tiktok and suddenly thinks she's underprivileged despite growing up in the same privileged environment. To me, she just sounds jealous that you can afford saffron topped desserts lol", "NTA, I think lashing out one time after constantly being attacked by someone who is quite obviously being an AH by judging you on your financial status is not an AH move, now if you continue to do this then yes that would be an AH move.", "NTA. Don't keep poking the bear if you don't wanna get mauled lol", "ESH.\n\nYour sister is an A H for continually poking at you.\n\nYou are the A H for escalating and how you said it.", "NTA. The truth hurts and she didn't want to hear it.", "Yeah you\u2019re also ignorant", "Or FAFO", "We were by the kitchen sink so we were separate from the dining room where everyone else was but not completely closed off.", "Garbage excuses. 2 people growing up in the same household are probably going to have the same education. You choose your own friend groups and how you respond to stigmatization from peers. Human lives are complex. Anybody can pull out a traumatizing event from their life and use that to make excuses. Barring any disabilities which I feel would be mentioned he is 100 percent in the right.", "^ Yes, all of this right here.", "How were her comments about trying to make a living by intentionally trying to date rich men irrelevant if they were true?", "Perfectly healthy, capable, qualified people who refuse to work because mooching off of people is the easier option are a thing, believe me", "This is the problem with bottling things up for the sake of peace. You let it go too long and by the time you can't take it anymore your emotions are so high that you can't help but turn a long period of small resentments into a blow out you have little control over. Even if she did deserve it (which, I mean, yeah probably) all you did was give her ammo to feed her victim complex and she's probably able to convince the rest of your family you were an AH. \n\nIf someone starts making small digs at you constantly you either need to cut them out or call it out ASAP before your emotions take over."]}
