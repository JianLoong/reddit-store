Don't assert generalities about her (e.g. you're lazy), instead if you call out behavior, focus on what could change or specific actions (e.g. you shouldn't buy another new car, or try looking for another job). Also, having facts at your disposal about costs can be a great way to fight back without escalating the situation.\n\n\nIn my city a gallon of water costs about 1 cent. The cost to heat a gallon of water is about 2 cents. The cost of a paper towel is about 5 cents. So washing your hands with a gallon of hot water is less expensive than drying them with a paper towel, and you likely use way less than a gallon, and don't use hot water. Taking a shower is about 2.1 gallons per minute, and the average shower time is 8 minutes, so it takes over 16 gallons of water for a shower. So that's 16\u00a2 for water, plus 16\u00a2-32\u00a2 for heating so 32\u00a2-48\u00a2 for a shower, vs 1\u00a2-2\u00a2 for washing hands thoroughly.

I clawed my way up through corporate america, but there's stuff that helped me succeed that I only learned because my husband was there with me as a corporate mentor.
