She just stopped breastfeeding him, but even when she was she has not got that much sleep because of him waking up to feed, or at the moment waking up because he wants to feed (but isn't allowed). \n\nI've tried to take nights but he is really upset when I try.\n\nNow, because of her lack of sleep, my wife says she doesn't have any energy to take any fights with the kids. They are allowed to eat anything (ice-cream for breakfast for example), they are allowed to scream and behave and push her around. She is never left alone. \n\nAs soon as they want something she goes out of her on way to please them. This of course means she can barely have a cup of coffee because of one of the kids pulling on her. \n\nI try to take one of them as much as I can to do stuff if she needs a rest, like going to play grounds, or taking both to my parents etc. \n\nBut for me it's come to a point where our time together as a family is painful. I've been to the ER with headaches and have meds for it because of the amount of screaming and fighting at home. \n\nNow today I snapped and told her it was her fault for it being this way and that we need to to boundries on our kids. \n\nShe is very upset that I'm not supporting her and blaming her. \n\nShe is a fantastic mum in so many ways, but this path is leading to the kids behaving extremely bad at home. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: I've accepted that I was an Asshole for solely blaming her.

Instead of blaming someone you need to step up as the slightly more functional parent and work together to figure out solutions. Blame like that has no place when raising kids. Find a way let your wife get some sleep, find a babysitter or family that can help ya'll take some time together and work it out. Kids are hard, i feel you.", "Yta for blaming her exclusively. You are a parent too and those children, shitty behavior and all, are equally your responsibility and represent you as a parent as well. Instead of yelling and blaming you could be working out a schedule or picking up an extra shift to pay for a sitter or any number of things", "YTA\n\nAssuming YOUR children and their behavior are exclusively her fault/problem/responsibility is terrible. You say you tried, but that\u2019s how you reveal you\u2019re being the AH. You don\u2019t try to take care of your children, you do it. You intervene. You take responsibility. They\u2019re both of your children. Parent together!", "YTA. why don't you set boundaries for the kids? She's not the only parent. And taking them away to give her a break is not setting a boundary.", "Yta.\n\nAren't you the father? Aren't you supposed to help raising the children?\n\nAsk for help to a therapist or a nanny to understand how to deal with Kids \n\nFind solution, not blame.", "So what are you doing to actually support your wife, and help her with the children? Why do you think that the children are only shaped by her actions but not yours?\n\nYTA \n\nTry actually pitching in instead of throwing blame? Like, damn.", "YTA\n\nShe is having to be a parent day and night, and you are both aware of the effect this is having on her, and she has explained it to you, and yet from your post it's clear you haven't really taken on your share of night time duty to alleviate her exhaustion.  It doesn't matter that your 1 year old is upset when you 'try' to do nights. That's a classic cop out line dads use to get out of the difficult parenting chores. You aren't part of their routine yet because you've done it so little, so no wonder they are upset, and that is on you. It doesn't get you out of doing it though, and your child will be fine when it becomes routine that you do 3 or 4 nights a week. \n\nOnce your wife isn't exhausted anymore THEN talk about parenting techniques. Your 5 year old is the one to focus on, as your younger will be learning behaviour from them too.", "...How the devil is a 1 year old pushing her around? I know one year olds. They mostly just make noises and fall over. \n\nI'm going to go with ESH because if things have deteriorated that much it's both of your faults. You're a parent, too. If your wife is too tired to handle the kids during the day, let her sleep more while you watch them. \n\nAlso, seriously, how does a one year old push you around? You just drop them in a crib with soft toys and at worst they can try to be loud.", "YTA. I cannot even begin to count the ways. FFS, parent your children. If you don't know how get on the YouTube and start learning, let your pediatrician know what's going on, take some free parenting classes.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s fault she\u2019s a nurturing mother who struggles to say no or take a minute to herself. Blaming her for the kids removes responsibility from you as their father. What have you not done to help foster their behavior ? You need to come together as a united front and put your feet down. Come up with a system that works together and hopefully their behavior changes.", "YTA.  You are BOTH responsible for setting boundaries for your children and learning how to effectively discipline.  Your wife needs help, not criticism.  \n\nTake the initiative to improve YOUR parenting techniques and demonstrate for your wife how it is done.  Read books, watch videos, or talk to experts.  Effective parenting can be learned by both of you.", "This sounds like an episode of SuperNanny. Honestly, I would recommend watching that show if you can; it's full of ways to get control of your kids and there's always a happy ending.", "Slight ESH. I am so permanently exhausted I can\u2019t even explain it. My one year old still breastfeeds through the night and the kids (1 and 3.5) are hard work. Some days I don\u2019t have the energy to fight and I do give in. You want mini muffins (basically cake tbh) whatever. Yes. Just leave me alone long enough to make coffee and you can have whatever you want. I understand your wife to an extent. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to have a free pass to have no boundaries ever. At the end of the day an authoritative (NOT authoritarian, and not permissive either) parenting style is what results in best outcomes for our children. It\u2019s hard work but it\u2019s got to be done. Her saying she can\u2019t take on *any* fights with the kids is not acceptable. It can be hard (totally easier to put on TV than deal with the tantrum when you don\u2019t), but you\u2019re setting your kids up for failure by letting them have whatever they want whenever they want. Do I sometimes allow more junk and TV than would be ideal? You betcha. But pushing/hitting/screaming needs to be addressed \n\nI also think you are an AH for snapping the way you did. I think you could\u2019ve addressed lack of boundaries without placing all the blame on her. Being in a marriage is about being a partnership and taking on these challenges together. You should be making a game plan together about how to tackle these challenges.", "YTA. That is normal kid behaviour. They are 5 and 1!! She sounds absolutely exhausted and you had no right to blame her for trying to survive some of the hardest years a mum is faced with. \n\nBy all means, get yourself some help. Talk to a counsellor, wear some noise cancelling earphones...but DONT blame your tired wife.", "YTA\n\nBro there are 2 parents in this. You and your wife. Blaming solely your wife for the way your kids is a dick thing to do.\n\nThe thing is, you both let your kids get to this point where they can walk over you two. \n\nWhat is your discipline for the 5 year old when he acts out?", "YTA.  This is a parenting problem, not a mom problem.  Listen closely:  KIDS NEED BOUNDARIES.  They NEED them.  They simply can't function well without them.  You two - both of you - are not setting them and enforcing them.  You think things are bad now?  They can get worse, much much worse.  And they will if you BOTH don't step up right now.  You are the parents.  Act like it.  Please strongly consider taking a parenting course or two, again both of you, and make sure you're both on the same page.  But the ice cream at breakfast should stop yesterday, along with every other boundary you haven't established and they haven't observed.  That is the only way to make them behave better, and to raise responsible and productive adults.  The way you're doing it now will result in years of misery, followed by adult children that you might be shocked and saddened by.  Please don't go down that road.", "YTA.  There are 2 parents for your children it\u2019s not all her fault.", "So yeah kids act wild with zero discipline at home btw. ESH y\u2019all setting your kids up for failure allowing this kind of behavior to even start. Why they hell are they getting ice cream for breakfast? So many issues here, hire a nanny so your wife can get some sleep and y\u2019all need parenting classes badly.\n\nAfter seeing your responses you\u2019re clearly the asshole. You don\u2019t wanna discuss other parenting techniques because yours clearly aren\u2019t working? Absolutely asinine.\n\nThere\u2019s a book, your kids are your own fault. That\u2019s definitely you right now", "Most moms are sleep deprived but this is far from normal.  Y\u2019all need parenting classes \u2014 it\u2019s not a skill you\u2019re magically born with \u2014 or at least some online videos.  Your wife may also need therapy.  Is it possible she has PPD?

Sounds like you're both creating the behavior from the kids.", "You don't want to discuss parenting ways, but you have an exclusively parenting ways problem.\n\n1. You and your wife don't agree on how to parent, this is a huge issue as it gives the kids the chance to play you against each other. You have to be on the same side so that the kids learn what is good and what is bad. They only learn that from their parents, the knowledge doesn't come built-in\n\n2. You need to involve a professional family counselor or other child development expert asap and let them show you how to proper parent, or help you work our your different approaches.\n\n3. Your wife needs to be taught, and I really mean take lessons, or have someone come into your home and show her, how to install boundaries and rules for children. It is too late to come from you, if you did it or would only damage your relationship. Getting kids to understand \"no\" and boundaries are hard at first, you have to go against the immediate want of the child and accept them being upset. But kids are actually thankful for guidance, they want to have rituals and rules, so that they can orientate themselves in this confusing world.\n\nSo if your wife starts installing rules and follow them through it will be tough at first. She will have to stand through screaming and unhappy kids and if she's too tired or not used to this she will not make it through this phase without help. There needs to be someone at her side saying \"this is okay, wait for one more minute, your kid is fine\".\n\nI would advise you to talk to your wife and tell her to \"get someone to help us get to a good point with our kids\". Make it about you two, because you also have to play your part and you are also responsible for letting things get to this point, even if you alone do things differently. Your kids are still young, it's easier now (probably will take a bit longer with your 5 yo), the longer you wait the harder it will get and you are also setting them up for a failed social life and no friendships.\n\nIf you put in the effort and some money in now, you will have a well rested and calm family, and this is really worth it.", "Wow, YTA youre not into discussing other parenting techniques and instead blame your spouse for everything.

I have known this child since he was a toddler and have been concerned for years about how he'd turn out.

He gives his son lavish gifts and undoes her efforts to parent him.  They're wealthy so her husband can afford anything he wants.
