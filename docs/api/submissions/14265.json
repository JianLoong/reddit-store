If the money was promised to the by their grandparents then the grandparents would have GIVEN it to them. It is your money to do as you choose.

Most people would prefer to spend their declining years in their own home being taken care of by private staff then end up in a nursing home that may be short-staffed and where you may not receive the best care.\n\nI can only hope when I get to that age, I can afford in home care and have the ability to enjoy my favorite foods in a home I am comfortable in and am able to ensure that I can choose my own caretakers. I have heard to many horror stories about nursing homes to want to be put in one if I have a choice.", "NTA\n\nThey don't follow tradition so why should you follow tradition? \n\nThey think you shouldn't use this money because they want to use this money...\n\nThis inheritance could grow because older generation had help from their children, so they didn't have to spend as much money. When this system stops working it goes both ways: no help means you have to use inheritance.\n\nIf you think that you'll need care when you're older, look for some options to secure your money. Trust fund maybe? I mean if there is a possibility you will need a guardian with power of attorney. If you won't do it this role automatically go to your children.", "NTA. While your parents likely expected you to ensure there is an inheritance for your children to receive, they also likely expected your kids to care for you when you\u2019re no longer able to care for yourself. Since they\u2019re not willing to obligate themselves to do the work, why should they benefit from the notional reward?  Still, generational wealth planning dictates you never spend the principle. You\u2019re still going to need to plan for the time you\u2019re not able to care for yourself, and that money would be better spent doing that. I\u2019d recommend talking to a financial advisor to invest those funds for when you may need to live in an assisted care facility. Keep the money where it can do you good when you need it, and do some estate planning, so your grandchildren can inherit instead of your children.  Your children may not owe you their support when you\u2019re older, but by the same token, they also can\u2019t expect you to leave them an inheritance.", "It is YOUR inheritance. They will get whatever you leave for them. Inheritance only exists upon passing.\nLive and fund your old years as you wish. Your children can fend for themselves.", "NTA. Your children were callous to tell you point-blank they would not be taking of care of you if you needed help in old age. They openly said they were going to take the selfish route and leave you out in the cold at the most vulnerable time of your life. \n\nWhen they said that, they broke the social contract that existed in your family for previous generations. Since they broke the reciprocal social contract, they can't expect you to hold up your end of the deal.\n\nI wouldn't worry about leaving them any money, at this point. There's no reason for you to feel guilty about spending it on trips or whatever else you want. But be sure to invest some for your future care, since you know your children won't be providing it. You might want to buy long-term care insurance and put aside funds for your future medical needs.", "NTA. They want to have their cake and eat it too. Why should you penny pinch through your life to save as much as possible for them of the money that was left to you? Especially knowing they don\u2019t care enough to even tell you they all apparently had a meeting WEEKS AGO and decided you were on your own in your old age? I say enjoy your trips, invest/save for your wonder years, and they can enjoy being free of any concern or caretaking duties. They just have to release all aspects of the tradition, not just the ones they don\u2019t like.", "When are the children supposed to receive their inheritance? Are they supposed to get it, when they are caring for you?\n\nCall me cynical, but there seems to be a lot of adult children who put their parents in a care home, after they get the money.  \n\nDid you care for your parents until their death?  Yes, then plan out your care plan with your inheritance.  You can write out your will and leave portions of family money to your kids   \n\nIf one child steps up, write a larger portion for the care provider.  If it is a care home, write them in or a charity of your choice.\n\nI don't know if your parents would agree that the grandkids should be getting extra money after failing to care for you in your final years\n\nNTA", "NTA and also be careful. Go to a lawyer and set something up to have a guardian appointed in the event that you become ill and in the hospital for even a few days and your kids have to get any say in what\u2019s happening to you because they can rob you of everything and put you in a permanent guardianship. It happens more than you ever want to believe", "Definitely leaning towards NTA. The only contributing factor I can think of is if you didn\u2019t really contribute anything to it and have been coasting off money left behind to you.\n\nEven then though, I\u2019m inclined to say that people shouldn\u2019t factor in inheritance into their financial plans as it\u2019s a bonus that not everyone has the luxury of. Relying on a pay off when your parents die seems a little distasteful particularly if you haven\u2019t worked as hard as you could\u2019ve in expectation of receiving it.", "NTA - Weird question honestly. You inherited the money from your parents. It's your money. Unless your parents had some clause that some of the money was to be held in trust for your children, they have no claim to the money. \n\nYour children have no desire to financially support you as you age, so you should be under no obligation to go without, or not spend your own money to support your own lifestyle while you're alive.  Your kids are counting their chickens before they've hatched.", "At first, it sounded like you're an ah, but NTA after reading the. whole thing. Your children are only interested in the money, not in you. They say that you don't want to follow the tradition, but neither want they - that double standard cost them the inheritance. \n\nEnjoy your money and make sure you get the most out of it and make sure you have enough to have a caretaker or nice nursing home. \n\nYou're not robbing your kids of anything, it is not their money yet and if they don't care about you they don't deserve the money.", "Title is a bit confusing. Is the inheritance given to your childern, or is it yours but you wanted to save it for your childern? If it's the latter, YWNBTA", "NTA\n\nOh the hypocrisy!  They are being selfish themselves by telling you that you're acting selfishly,  because they want YOUR money. No, not cool children. \n\nYou absolutely need to set yourself up to retire and enjoy life. We only get one of them! Besides, your parents would have wanted you to be happy and do these things while you're still young. Too many of us wait til we are too old to finally go out and enjoy the world. Your children do not have a right to your income while you're living. And it's not like you'll leave them with nothing! Geez, they are the selfish ones here, not yourself. Enjoy!!", ">robbing them of the money that their grandparents promised them\n\nYou'd be TA if you are aware that your parents promised them money but spent it anyway. However your children are AH for being so callous and unfeeling. Surely they know it runs in the family and they are likely to suffer the same fate, if they can't muster the empathy then they realistically can't expect you to do nothing to help yourself.", "NTA.", "NTAH That money goes to them after you die. Until then they have no right to it. They expect you to save it for them? That's bullshit. Go enjoy your life and don't worry about them. They can have what's left AFTER you die, but you don't owe them anything because it's yours.", "Every judgment applies here. They're not entitled to inheritance if they have already stated they have no plans to help you in old age. Expectations of filial piety are equally disgusting to me. Your use of funds that could sustain you when you are in poor health later in life also feels shortsighted.", "NTA for using the money to take care of yourself when that's what your family who died would have wanted, but it's a travesty to use it as your slush fund when some of that money could still be handed down as they intended. Rethink your vacations, that's a petty revenge.", "NTA - the money is yours, if they don\u2019t want to help you than you will need that money to care for yourself. They shouldn\u2019t hold any expectations for it", "NTA- the family inheritance is cultural and a tradition in your family. Taking care of your parents is also culture and tradition in your family. You can\u2019t have one and not the other, that\u2019s cherry picking.", "Since it is YOUR money, spend it as you see fit.  Start first with long term healthcare options/insurance, since your children denied you of care in your elder years, YOU can finance your life.  From start to the literal finish.

One, you don't know how long you'll live. You're in your mid to late 50s if you got your children young, so you might have another 30-40 years to go. Have a budget, but enjoy life. Two, your relationship with your kids is undoubtedly going to sour seeing how they react now. I get that you're angry with them (who wouldn't be?) but keep a level head: think about what kind of relationship you want with them and act in a way that gets you there. \n\nTo be honest, I don't get how children covet their parents' money. It's theirs to do with as they want, not just to keep safe for the next generation. Are your 3 kids not going to touch it either because they have kids? Makes no sense.", "We are mere redditors. This issue seems too large for us to pass any verdicts.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t following tradition so why should you? Spend that money on yourself. Be sure to make arrangements for your care in writing so they can\u2019t stick you in a crappy home and keep the money. It\u2019s not their inheritance until you die.

The inheritance was going to them with that implicit string attached.  They've cut the string.\n\nTherefore you need money that would have gone to them in order to purchase care for yourself in your later years.  That accounts for a critical portion of the potential inheritance.\n\nAs for you spending some of the money for pleasure?  Why not.

But I am having a hard time with the \"You are not doing what I expect so now I will take care nothing will be left when I die.\" vibes I get here. \n\n\nINFO: Is your children's life different than your life was? Is it comparable at all? Did you personally take care of your parents or was it your wife who did that? \n\nDo your daughters, DILs work?\n\nDo you like or love your children and grandchildren?\n\n\nMy parents are talking about their future plans with us, but their tone is \"We absolutely don't want to become a burden to any of you.

I understand that in your culture the inheritance iseant to be generational and probably you are expected to increase it through your own work and investments and leave it to your children.\n\nIf it's as substantial as you say, a trip to Mexico shouldn't make much of a dent in it, but your children began by policing your ability to pay for it and then gulting you for paying for it from the inheritance. It is clear that they feel entitled to every penny. \n\nBut your culture also says that the children are expected to care for their parents. Your children are breaking that while still expecting the cultural benefit. Unfortunately, because of that, you have to spend the inheritance on your care during your old age.  Too bad for them.\n\nIn my opinion the inheritance went to you. It is as much for your security as for theirs. If your parents wanted the money to go to the grandchildren, they could have se secured it for them, instead of just \"promising\" them a big payday.\n\nYou should save as much of it as possible for your own old age, and enjoy your trip to Mexico. If there's anything left, then they might get it. Or you might leave it to those friends and relatives that are there for you as you get older.", "Agreed, I was all set to say Y T A when he started going on about the tradition of the kids taking care of their parents (thinking that who ever gets him should get the inheritance to help with those finances). But then he said that none of them are willing to do that, so my mind changed to NTA, but maybe leave them a little. Then they all got pissed he was planning one trip. Oh hell, no OP, go wild, live your life, and enjoy it. Your kids are acting like golddiggers, and golddiggers dont deserve inheritance, IMO.", "This. That money is meant to go, in part, towards op's quality of life in old age.  Paying their dues and supporting op would mean op doesn't have to spend money to get the same level of care and support from hired support. \n\nIt's likely some will be left over but no op should not have to suffer for entitled brats.", "NTA this 100 percent. First off it isn\u2019t your children\u2019s inheritance it\u2019s yours. \n\nSecond I hate to say it but your children only see you as their ATM.  They only want to have a relationship with you when it benefits them. \n\nMy suggestion would be plan for when your older and need help. Your children already told you when this time comes your on your own. So make sure you have things in place to have care for yourself.  Have a trusted friend/relative sit in place for when the time comes they have all financial and medical decision making.\n\nTake the rest of the money and live your best life. You do not owe your kids an inheritance at all. \n\nI personally would make sure I spent it all and just in case I didn\u2019t. I would have a will in place that said whatever money is left over is donated to a charity in your name.\n\n\nThe next time your children ask you how you are paying or affording a trip or item. Simply tell them your finances is not any of their business.  We they complain/ guilt/manipulate you about spending their inheritance their grandparents left them simply tell them if their go wanted them to have something they would left it to them. And explain that do to raising cost in the economy they are not guaranteed any of the money would be left considering you have to take care of yourself and make sure you will be ok. With today\u2019s economy it would be wise for them not to count on money that may not be there after you pass away.", "Yeah. Go on one reasonably priced one, but then hold off until after meeting with a retirement and financial adviser.", "NTA. This. My mother has a large sum in her name. Dementia is slowly taking over. The decision was made for care a little while ago. Most of my siblings and I are like 'go spend it, you deserve you'. Those that aren't can go jump as far as I'm concerned.", "Ditto! Like... why is the money more important than the person who has it?\n\nI've known so many people who get downright nasty and resentful of their still living parents or grandparents for spending their own money. It's gross. My ex friend, for example, his mom is well off and has a nice house, etc. But he's constantly harassing her for it, saying he wants his inheritance NOW, and it's not fair he has to wait till she dies to get it so he can \"start his life. The dude is 36 and is watching his mom's wallet like a vulture. Literally googling everything she buys or event she goes to and tallies up what she spends while bitching about how he could have spent it on this or that. And when he grossly overspends on his monthly budget, he immediately goes ranting and raving to her about how he wouldn't be in X financial situation if she gave him the money now. She won't because she knows he has a spending problem and has gotten to the point where she tells him straight up no, last I heard she told him if he didn't stop harassing her about it, she'd just donate everything.\n\nMy ex is like this, too. Ex got disinherited when my ex inlaws found out about their years long cheating escapade. Their parents changed their will to name the kiddos as their soul beneficiaries.  Ex was furious when they found out because they, apparently, had made all these grandiose plans with money that wasn't even theirs. The kids are 8 and 7 and have no clue about the huge amount coming their way, and I had instructed my ex inlaws to keep it that way till the last minute. My ex inlaws are amazing, and their time and presence are more valuable than money. I don't want the relationship with them tainted with the promise of cash.", "In one of op\u2019s comments he said do to his family\u2019s health issues he has already been planning for his care. He had been saving for years to make sure he could afford his care later in life. \n\nOp isn\u2019t taking several trips and traipsing all over the world and spending all of his money on gambling and drugs. He is simply going to take 2 trips one to a place he has spent his life wanting to visit and a second one to go back to his home country and visit family.  Op said after these 2 trips he is returning home and going to spend his retirement living a simple life.", "I am not saying your wrong in your observation about op\u2019s joke or the fact he decide to spend the money after his kids refuse to take care of him. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t feel he is being petty. I think when he realizes that his kids didn\u2019t want to help in him in his golden years it kind of gave him permission to not follow family traditions himself. \n\n\nWhen he realized the kids no longer wanted to follow culture customs then it kind of freed him from doing the same with passing down inheritances. It gave him permission instead of saving his money like he had been taught to make sure kids had a inheritance he could enjoy his money because the kids no longer wanted to follow cultural customers.\n\nSo like one poster said you can\u2019t cherry pick which family tradition or cultural customs you want to follow. You can\u2019t decide I know in out culture it is expected I take care of my parents but I decided to  not follow it but yet I still expect a bid payday from my parents because it\u2019s family tradition or cultural customs.", "Why is one adult out of a group of adults responsible for the action to fix everything ?? There are no children in the age sense here - everyones an adult.", "Same thought process here. I am from a similar culture. If my kids said that to me, I would start looking at elderly resort type communities to live in, where I can rely on some support and enjoy spending time with peers like me. That costs money. OP was able to inherit money because they cared for their own parents. The same should be the same for the kids. If they want more of the inheritance, then they should be willing to follow the same path.", "Which is why I suggested op leave any money to charity.  Find an organization that helps people from his country with the same medical issues that need help. \n\nOp\u2019s kids need to learn that your not entitled to anything in life.", "I\u2019m so sorry your children don\u2019t realise the importance of being there for elderly parents. This is YOUR inheritance it wasn\u2019t promised to them. You were just going to give them some. Since you will be taking care of yourself, it\u2019s only right you use that money for yourselves. Enjoy your trips and live the rest of your life long and healthy.", "What are you reading dude ?", "I read a post not long ago and it said that family traditions are just peer pressure from dead relatives that didn\u2019t get a chance to live in the world we do now.  \n\nMeaning we certain traditions like in op\u2019s family where started as a way for parents showing their appreciation for their children taking care of them in their golden years. The parents made sure to save so their kids would have an inheritance. But let\u2019s all face it in this present time we. Are lucky if our children visit us in our golden years. And most children like op\u2019s children don\u2019t want to help their parents as they get older. So there is no need of op\u2019s family tradition of saving as much money as possible to make sure you reward your children for taking care of you as you age.", "I think a lot of what you said is spot on.\n\nI do dislike (not you, just the idea, not saying you are wrong) that inheritance is some cultural tradition. Imo, and again, just an opinion, making sure your kids had it better than you did is the whole point of inheritance, or at least giving them resources to help take care of their kids and their families. \n\nThe op saying he is going to spend all the inheritance (unless I read that wrong, I very well could have) on his old age care could be seen as selfish and vindictive. Say if he spent 100k out of 200k, I would not call that selfish at all. But if he spent 100k out of 110k, and only needed 50k expenditures but chose to spend more on himself, then that is not ok, imo.\n\nA lot of variables we don't have information regarding. \n\nThe whole \"you won't take care of me, fine, I won't take care of you\" feels very petty and vindictive. \n\nThe point about cherry picking customs goes both ways. If the custom is to take care of your parents, he gets upset when they don't, then expecting an inheritance, but not getting one, is ok to be upset about. Imo, inheritance isn't even a cultural custom, more just a human custom, in some form or fashion across the world.\n\nThe OP doesn't have to spend an inheritance on the kids, but I do feel it is sort of a dick move to spend an entire inheritance (assuming one does not need to) just because the kids said no.\n\nThat's why to me this feels like it is very specifically worded, and likely missing context.", "No OP is going, if they're going to break the chain, then I will first. And he's not taking money for retirement and senior care, he's going to have a party.\n\n That's why it's E S H. No one is behaving well with the grandparents money.", "I'm saying if multiple people are not willing to house the same person that should be a hint. That person probably has issues in which they need to fix. It sounds like op wants everyone to kiss their butt just because they have money. It seems like just because op has the money they can act like a AH and do whatever they want instead of fixing their issues. While it takes two to tango a petson has to acknowledge what happened.", "My thoughts exactly! Spend it, dude.", "When you have a lot of money invested it grows by itself over the long term. So with a long term family fund like this, it's possible for multiple generations to benefit. Let's say you had a million dollars invested just as a round number, you could take out an average of $30k/year and not ever run out. If some years you didn't need to use your allowance and left it invested, or of course if you add to it from your own income, that increases the safety margin and the level of payments / number of people the fund could support. If on the other hand you start spending down the principal, it will run out faster than you might expect. \n\nSounds like OP's children have the choice of paying for his old age care out of their own incomes and time/labour, or for OP to have to use the family fund to pay for it. I don't see how OP could be expected to prioritise keeping the fund intact for future generations if he's been putting all his savings there and family won't support him directly.", "877 cash noww! \ud83c\udfb6 \ud83c\udfb5 \ud83d\ude06", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that.

NTA!!\n\n1. The inheritance is not from your parents to your children. If you parents had wanted anything to go directly to their grandkids, they could/would/should have put that in their wills. The inheritance is YOURS and YOURS ALONE to decide what to do with.\n2. Even if your wife were still alive, the inheritance would still have been yours alone. Of course, you could/would/should use some of it for the family's betterment, but it would still be your decision alone how to spend it.\n3. Your parents and ancestors were good stewards of the family wealth. I imagine you will be, too. But you did not tell your parents how they could spend their money. You did not claim it as yours prior to their passing. YOUR CHILDREN ARE GREEDY AND CLAIMING OWNERSHIP OF SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THEIRS!!\n4. Funny how your children have no problem throwing out their family history/culture of caring for their parents in old age, respecting their parents decision AND are making up a new 'tradition' that they get to claim family wealth that they never earned, never contributed to and is, in fact, currently owned by a person they have said they will not care for when the need arises.\n5. You absolutely SHOULD spend the money on things you would like to do while you have the time, the money, and the health to do. You should also research and make arrangements for your long-term care when that need arises. Do not skimp. Get yourself the quality of care you will want.\n6. You also need to meet with a lawyer and create key documents to protect your interests as you age. Examples include: a physician's directive, a medical power of attorney, a will, with a named executor (or a trust and trustees), a power of attorney. DO NOT NAME A SINGLE ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN TO ANY ONE OF THE POSITIONS OF TRUST. They have already made it clear that they would not fulfill the obligations that come with those positions (executor/ power of attorney...) to act in your best interests. Your children have made clear to you that they would act to serve their own interests and not yours.\n7. I further suggest you consider putting the bulk of any inheritance into a trust for your GRANDCHILDREN to inherit (again, with someone other than your children as the trustees). Given your children's greed, I suggest you name a lawyer instead of a family member as executor/trustee because you can expect your children to be belligerent towards anyone who controls the funds.\n8. Despite all this, you can still leave something in your will for your children to inherit. But leave most of it in a trust for your grandchildren. Since your pwn children feel so strongly that the family wealth is meant to go to the younger generation - you can make crystal clear to them that you have now ensured that 'the grandchildren (of you!) will inherit their due'.", "It's your parents.

We have done our job.\n\nI think there is nothing wrong with op sitting money aside to care for himself as his illness progresses and enjoying the rest of his money on himself. Raising kids, if done right, is a lot of work and sacrifices and that is what we sign up for when we have them.

We helped them through school and help them get established as adults but I know longer feel(just my option) I owe them an inheritance. Don\u2019t get me wrong I do not plan to spend or wast money as we get older but if I wanted to take a few trips(which we plan to do) I see no issue in it.\n\nWe even plan trips and take our kids and their so with us. We pay for everything. However my kids know not to expect x amount of money when we pass. Yes they will inherit family items that have been passed down that are valuable and sentimental but I do not plan to pass x amount of money to them. I plan to spend my golden years making memories. Going on trip. Taking the kids and grand kids with us. Buy our kids things now that they can\u2019t afford or would not spend the money on themselves. Saving money for when we are a lot older and need help so the kids have no financial responsibility to us. I even plan to buy our grandkids bonds and save to help their parents put them through school.\n\nBut I do not plan to leaving them an inheritance in my option my financial obligation to them is done. I went above and beyond to give them a better life. But I do intend to enjoy what ever life I have left. I may be considered greedy for my views and I am ok with that. But I feel my husband and I have earned the right to have fun with the money we have worked hard to make. If there is money left then it will be theirs. There are insurance policies that they will get. But I do not plan to save and not enjoy life so I can leave them x amount of money.\n\n\nAnd I don\u2019t say this because I am punishing my children because they wouldn\u2019t take care of me if needed.

You can legally have one, but most people don't do them. That makes that by law evrything automatically goes to spous if alive and present, if not to child/ren if they exist and so on... Usualy when children inherit with a paren present it's because the parent still alive wanted them to, but there are some exceptions. But tradition is that the person who inherits by law will dispose of the inheritance the way the deceased would have wanted. Yeah, rarely works, since people suck. Can't tell you about all the horror stories about families at each other's throats due to the inheritance.\n\nKnowing that, two of my grandparents died unexpectedly. My grandma had only my mon and us grandchildren, she was poor, but owned apartment, car, jewlery and had valued some linnns more than said jewlery. While she was alive she would give those heirlooms as gifts often enough and would often talk how some of us grandchildren would recieve some of the stuff when we graduated/got married or other major events. We all knew what her wishes were, from the apartment down to the last precious tablecloth. The idea was, she would give away all the stuf that wasn't going to finance her stay in a retirement home. When she died unexpectedly way to soon, my mom inherited all the stuff not already gifted, and didn't give flying fart about her mom's wishes. Problem is that my mom is rater unfair and posessive and has favorites among children to the point that I'm sure I'll never get to inherit anything my grandma had ever expressed she wanted. I don't care or need it nor do I, now that it would come from her, want it. I mostly missed grandma who raised me more than my mom, but I was a bit hurt mostly by my mom's lack of care for her mom's wishes, so I understand that sometimes grandchildren my feel that's unfair.\n\nMy grandad died on my dad's birthday pretty much in his arms. and it messed my dad up bad.

My dad has a sister and to say that they dont really like each other would be an understatement. When I was 10 i had to watch them wrestle, literally, over a bottle of wine that was gifted to my dad, and my aunt drunk while we were at a vacation. Both of them are assholes, essentially. My grandma was set to inherit everything then but knowing her kids are assholes she refused to inherit anything non monetary, and basically devided all of grandad's and her assets between everyone in the family, mostly two of them, so they can't cause a scene when she dies.\n\nMy point is that neither of them expected to die how they did with enough time to \"get their affaifs in order\" and basically let the law and tradition (or my grandma in grandad's case) deal with that shit.\n\nTLDR: My family in general is a toxic cesspool, and in a culture where wills are not the norm, but expect tradition to regulate who inherits what, that becomes a real problem.", "Well, not necessarily.

I suspect you set the stage for this long ago.\n\nSecond: in my culture an inheritance isn\u2019t legally \u201cowed\u201d to anyone, though there are kids who think it is owed.

Obviously in both cases people will choose to support their child/parent for as long as they can or when it's needed, but that's a choice not an obligation. \n\nOP's kids have as much of a choice to not provide elder care as OP does about spending their own money.
