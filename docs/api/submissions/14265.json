If the money was promised to the by their grandparents then the grandparents would have GIVEN it to them. It is your money to do as you choose.

Most people would prefer to spend their declining years in their own home being taken care of by private staff then end up in a nursing home that may be short-staffed and where you may not receive the best care.\n\nI can only hope when I get to that age, I can afford in home care and have the ability to enjoy my favorite foods in a home I am comfortable in and am able to ensure that I can choose my own caretakers. I have heard to many horror stories about nursing homes to want to be put in one if I have a choice.", "NTA\n\nThey don't follow tradition so why should you follow tradition? \n\nThey think you shouldn't use this money because they want to use this money...\n\nThis inheritance could grow because older generation had help from their children, so they didn't have to spend as much money. When this system stops working it goes both ways: no help means you have to use inheritance.\n\nIf you think that you'll need care when you're older, look for some options to secure your money. Trust fund maybe? I mean if there is a possibility you will need a guardian with power of attorney. If you won't do it this role automatically go to your children.", "NTA. While your parents likely expected you to ensure there is an inheritance for your children to receive, they also likely expected your kids to care for you when you\u2019re no longer able to care for yourself. Since they\u2019re not willing to obligate themselves to do the work, why should they benefit from the notional reward?  Still, generational wealth planning dictates you never spend the principle. You\u2019re still going to need to plan for the time you\u2019re not able to care for yourself, and that money would be better spent doing that. I\u2019d recommend talking to a financial advisor to invest those funds for when you may need to live in an assisted care facility. Keep the money where it can do you good when you need it, and do some estate planning, so your grandchildren can inherit instead of your children.  Your children may not owe you their support when you\u2019re older, but by the same token, they also can\u2019t expect you to leave them an inheritance.", "It is YOUR inheritance. They will get whatever you leave for them. Inheritance only exists upon passing.\nLive and fund your old years as you wish. Your children can fend for themselves.", "NTA. Your children were callous to tell you point-blank they would not be taking of care of you if you needed help in old age. They openly said they were going to take the selfish route and leave you out in the cold at the most vulnerable time of your life. \n\nWhen they said that, they broke the social contract that existed in your family for previous generations. Since they broke the reciprocal social contract, they can't expect you to hold up your end of the deal.\n\nI wouldn't worry about leaving them any money, at this point. There's no reason for you to feel guilty about spending it on trips or whatever else you want. But be sure to invest some for your future care, since you know your children won't be providing it. You might want to buy long-term care insurance and put aside funds for your future medical needs.", "NTA. They want to have their cake and eat it too. Why should you penny pinch through your life to save as much as possible for them of the money that was left to you? Especially knowing they don\u2019t care enough to even tell you they all apparently had a meeting WEEKS AGO and decided you were on your own in your old age? I say enjoy your trips, invest/save for your wonder years, and they can enjoy being free of any concern or caretaking duties. They just have to release all aspects of the tradition, not just the ones they don\u2019t like.", "When are the children supposed to receive their inheritance? Are they supposed to get it, when they are caring for you?\n\nCall me cynical, but there seems to be a lot of adult children who put their parents in a care home, after they get the money.  \n\nDid you care for your parents until their death?  Yes, then plan out your care plan with your inheritance.  You can write out your will and leave portions of family money to your kids   \n\nIf one child steps up, write a larger portion for the care provider.  If it is a care home, write them in or a charity of your choice.\n\nI don't know if your parents would agree that the grandkids should be getting extra money after failing to care for you in your final years\n\nNTA", "NTA and also be careful. Go to a lawyer and set something up to have a guardian appointed in the event that you become ill and in the hospital for even a few days and your kids have to get any say in what\u2019s happening to you because they can rob you of everything and put you in a permanent guardianship. It happens more than you ever want to believe", "Definitely leaning towards NTA. The only contributing factor I can think of is if you didn\u2019t really contribute anything to it and have been coasting off money left behind to you.\n\nEven then though, I\u2019m inclined to say that people shouldn\u2019t factor in inheritance into their financial plans as it\u2019s a bonus that not everyone has the luxury of. Relying on a pay off when your parents die seems a little distasteful particularly if you haven\u2019t worked as hard as you could\u2019ve in expectation of receiving it.", "NTA - Weird question honestly. You inherited the money from your parents. It's your money. Unless your parents had some clause that some of the money was to be held in trust for your children, they have no claim to the money. \n\nYour children have no desire to financially support you as you age, so you should be under no obligation to go without, or not spend your own money to support your own lifestyle while you're alive.  Your kids are counting their chickens before they've hatched.", "At first, it sounded like you're an ah, but NTA after reading the. whole thing. Your children are only interested in the money, not in you. They say that you don't want to follow the tradition, but neither want they - that double standard cost them the inheritance. \n\nEnjoy your money and make sure you get the most out of it and make sure you have enough to have a caretaker or nice nursing home. \n\nYou're not robbing your kids of anything, it is not their money yet and if they don't care about you they don't deserve the money.", "Title is a bit confusing. Is the inheritance given to your childern, or is it yours but you wanted to save it for your childern? If it's the latter, YWNBTA", "NTA\n\nOh the hypocrisy!  They are being selfish themselves by telling you that you're acting selfishly,  because they want YOUR money. No, not cool children. \n\nYou absolutely need to set yourself up to retire and enjoy life. We only get one of them! Besides, your parents would have wanted you to be happy and do these things while you're still young. Too many of us wait til we are too old to finally go out and enjoy the world. Your children do not have a right to your income while you're living. And it's not like you'll leave them with nothing! Geez, they are the selfish ones here, not yourself. Enjoy!!", ">robbing them of the money that their grandparents promised them\n\nYou'd be TA if you are aware that your parents promised them money but spent it anyway. However your children are AH for being so callous and unfeeling. Surely they know it runs in the family and they are likely to suffer the same fate, if they can't muster the empathy then they realistically can't expect you to do nothing to help yourself.", "NTA.", "NTAH That money goes to them after you die. Until then they have no right to it. They expect you to save it for them? That's bullshit. Go enjoy your life and don't worry about them. They can have what's left AFTER you die, but you don't owe them anything because it's yours.", "Every judgment applies here. They're not entitled to inheritance if they have already stated they have no plans to help you in old age. Expectations of filial piety are equally disgusting to me. Your use of funds that could sustain you when you are in poor health later in life also feels shortsighted.", "NTA for using the money to take care of yourself when that's what your family who died would have wanted, but it's a travesty to use it as your slush fund when some of that money could still be handed down as they intended. Rethink your vacations, that's a petty revenge.", "NTA - the money is yours, if they don\u2019t want to help you than you will need that money to care for yourself. They shouldn\u2019t hold any expectations for it", "NTA- the family inheritance is cultural and a tradition in your family. Taking care of your parents is also culture and tradition in your family. You can\u2019t have one and not the other, that\u2019s cherry picking.", "Since it is YOUR money, spend it as you see fit.  Start first with long term healthcare options/insurance, since your children denied you of care in your elder years, YOU can finance your life.  From start to the literal finish.

One, you don't know how long you'll live. You're in your mid to late 50s if you got your children young, so you might have another 30-40 years to go. Have a budget, but enjoy life. Two, your relationship with your kids is undoubtedly going to sour seeing how they react now. I get that you're angry with them (who wouldn't be?) but keep a level head: think about what kind of relationship you want with them and act in a way that gets you there. \n\nTo be honest, I don't get how children covet their parents' money. It's theirs to do with as they want, not just to keep safe for the next generation. Are your 3 kids not going to touch it either because they have kids? Makes no sense.", "We are mere redditors. This issue seems too large for us to pass any verdicts.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t following tradition so why should you? Spend that money on yourself. Be sure to make arrangements for your care in writing so they can\u2019t stick you in a crappy home and keep the money. It\u2019s not their inheritance until you die.

The inheritance was going to them with that implicit string attached.  They've cut the string.\n\nTherefore you need money that would have gone to them in order to purchase care for yourself in your later years.  That accounts for a critical portion of the potential inheritance.\n\nAs for you spending some of the money for pleasure?  Why not.

He had a great life and died at 90 in November, but there were more things he would have liked to do. My 4 siblings and I often joked about inheritance and who Mum and Dad loved the most, but the truth is we love them so much and don\u2019t expect a penny. It was their right to decide how things go. \n\nMake sure you get some good financial and legal advice, and that you have a good will drawn up. And enjoy your life. They should be happy that you are happy.", "NTA for spending your own money, but you are for expecting your children to take care of you. Travel, spend, enjoy your money, but make sure you have enough to pay for care in old age.", "NTA, it was your inheritance that you hoped to pass on to your children. The moment you learned the reality of it, that your children will not take you in, you now need your inheritance to take care of yourself. Provide your self a comfortable life to live out. I'm glad you were able to use it to take care of your parents, and help get your children to where they are now. But do not, for one second, let them tell you that it is their inheritance. The day you pass, whatever you leave behind will be their inheritance. This is yours, from your parents, to do as you please. I hope you end up using it all. Hopefully they come to realize you have all the right to do what you plan to do, this is the bed they've made. But most of all, I hope you have the most fun, and live out your life most comfortably.", "NTA Your children are selfish and greedy. To tell you to your face that they have no intentions of taking care of you in your old age was a very hurtful thing to do. And now they're more interested in the money then in your well being. It's not their inheritance until you die. Use your money to enjoy your life and to take care of yourself in your old age.", "NTA - They don't wanna follow tradition, fine. That frees you from tradition, too. Simple as that.", "NTA. Your children are selfish and mean. Spend the money as you see fit\u2014it\u2019s yours. But make sure there is enough should you live to 100. Your kids won\u2019t help you if you run out.", "Is it your money? If yes, the question really is if you're the AH for spending your money? If the grandparents wanted them to inherit something, why didn't they bequeath them something, and cut out the middle man, as it were?", "Exactly!", "Yes, I have an accountant who is helping me set up a savings account specifically for healthcare and stuff related to that. I appreciate you for worrying about that.", "Might be worth it to buy a small annuity just in case.", "Yea it's extremely selfish they can easily borrow and go into debt to help op", "OP please read this!! Make sure your money goes where you intend to. (I understand you have an advisor so probably you already thought about this as well).", "I contributed money. I only used the inheritance to pay for my children's education and my parents' health care, as it was intended to be used.", "Inheritance is family money.  I call it my children's because it's expected to be passed on to them almost entirely, so I feel guilty about spending that money, even if I need it.", "One of the reasons there are family money at all, is because the elderly didn't have to spend them on a retirement home an such things. \n\n\nThe money are now OP's, because he is still alive. If his kids made it clear that he needs to pay for when he's older, then it seems clear to me tht he will spend those money on himself.\n\n\nWhen the grandparents said that they expected the money to pass on like the previous generations did, they where likely expecting the grandchildren to also do what the previous generations did and take care of their father. They are the ones breaking the chain.", "Make sure you have a will, a living will, and an advocate in case your kids decide to declare you  incapacitated to get at your funds.", "\ud83c\udfb6I have an annuity and I need cash now ...", "Then you\u2019re definitely NTA. You\u2019ve fulfilled your obligations as a parent and you\u2019ve done the right thing by your own parents. Absolutely no reason to feel guilty for spending YOUR money on yourself.\n\nMy parents are still alive, I intend to care for them as they\u2019re getting older (cultural thing for me too) and I still encourage them to enjoy their lives and the money they worked their entire lives to earn while they can.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to say your kids are trying to have their cake and eat it, seems like they\u2019re counting down the days til they get that money.\n\nYou do you, tick off that bucket list and look after yourself!", "Then you can use it, because you need it. But I don't think your childern's reasoning of not taking care of you is wrong (regardless of tradition). You can just say that since none of them are willing to take care of you, you're gonna need any source you can to help yourself, and that is; the inheritance.\n\nIf you're feeling guilty because \"it's tradition\", maybe you shouldn't use it. I don't think that there's true or false here regarding morals.", "How does that work though? Are they supposed to also not touch it and keep saving and passing it on? Is anyone supposed to get to spend it?", "Nah retirement is going to be impossible for younger people anyways so might as well spend it", "Why are you spending it now on vacations when you'll need it to take care of yourself in your old age? Seems assholey...", "Call JG Wentworth. I heard he can help", "I'm not going to spend all the money on travel. I want to go to Mexico and then go back to my home country and visit my family. Then I'm going to come back and live a modest but comfortable life. The funds for my health have already been set aside with the help of my accountant.  \nAt least that's the plan. The medical tests didn't go very well."]}
