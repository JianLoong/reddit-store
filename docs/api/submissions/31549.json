Maybe something more social like CrossFit or a dance class would motivate you. \n\nI would sit down with your husband and tell him his snidey comments are not helping and how they are making you feel.

It's not a character flaw if he doesn't think a gut is attractive.\n\nYou can try to twist this as if your husband is in the wrong for even noticing, but he can love *you* the person inside the body and still talk about how you are gaining too much weight. \n\nI don't think setting up a dynamic where he has to pretend to not notice unhealthy weight gain is going to be helpful to either of you or your relationship.", "The way he's addressing it is wrong.

When you\u2019re looking to change your weight (up or down, it don\u2019t matter which one or for what reason), you don\u2019t want to cut things out of your diet. Unless it\u2019s an allergen or something you\u2019re having a negative reaction to, but that\u2019s separate from a weight loss/gain diet. Instead of cutting things out of your diet, add things that will get you to your goal whatever (weight, going from non-vegan to vegan, gaining muscles for the gym , truly whatever your goal is) to your diet. \n\nFor example, if you usually stress eat apple pie, eat a fresh apple first, but if you still want the pot afterwards, eat the pie. If it\u2019s ice cream, add in fruit sorbet, and then learn how to make it at home with honey, lemon juice, and frozen fruits so you can have an unlimited variety of what you like. If it\u2019s usually potato chips, you can add in the veggie straws chips or mini rice cakes, and eventually go from the latter two to adding in the fresh veggies. Your can still have the regular chips when you\u2019d like to, because changing your weight isn\u2019t about cutting things out, changing your weight is about what you\u2019re adding into your diet.\n\nYou won\u2019t see results straight away, you\u2019re more likely to feel the result faster than you see it. Like, I use this method to gain weight, and I discovered it as a weight loss method, but when you\u2019re adding things into the diet, all you need to do is add in things that promote what YOUR goal is. If your goal is to lower your cholesterol and not to affect your weight as the primary goal, add in low cholesterol foods into your diet. Wanna gain muscle? Add more protein and \u201cgood\u201d fats. Wanna go vegan but want to ease yourself into it? Add in vegan substitutes for non-vegan items and slowly add more things into your diet to veganize it over time.\n\nI\u2019d still recommend checking your weight once a month on average, but that would just be so you can see if it\u2019s truly your diet causing the weight changes or if you potentially need to go have your doctor check your hormones and other body systems and see if there\u2019s an underlying cause other than your diet affecting your weight.\n\nI would also suggest a free visit to couples therapy, just to have an impartial third party there to make your husband understand that his comments are the opposite of helpful, and so you have the space to task him he needs to back off when it comes to comments on your stomach and butt sizes.
