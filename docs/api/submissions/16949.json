I politely declined and explained why I couldn't. Harold and Lillian are extremely unhappy with my decision.\n\nI'm a fire marshal. I know it's called different things in different countries - my office investigates fires. Since fires don't just happen from Monday to Friday during business hours, I work all different shifts including overnight and on weekends. When Harold and Lillian announced their wedding date (shortly after the engagement and long before I was asked to be a bridesmaid) I checked my work schedule. My schedule is rotating and goes in a pattern so I can see it years in advance. I was scheduled to work on the day of the wedding. I arranged to switch with another marshal so I'm not working the day of the wedding. I've made sure I don't have to work and can attend the wedding and reception, otherwise that I'd be starting work before the ceremony starts and not finishing until after the reception ends.\n\nTo be a bridesmaid I would be expected to go to Lillian's dress appointments, to go on the group shopping trip to purchase the bridesmaid dresses, to help put together, host and clean up at the bridal shower, to go to the hair and makeup trial appointment, to help plan and go to the bachelorette party, to assist with things like making the centerpieces and decorating the reception room, to go to the the wedding rehearsal and dinner and more. Lilian has been up front about the commitment she wants. However with my work schedule I can't possibly do all that. The dates and times for those aren't set and have to work around Lillian's schedule foremost. I asked Lillian if I could be a bridesmaid and just go to the wedding and nothing else. She said no. Shee wants her bridesmaids committed to those things.\n\nMy sister asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and I couldn't do it for similar to reasons, on top of being in the middle of the biggest case of my career in the lead up to her wedding. My sister understood and didn't flip out like Lillian and Harold did. I explained the same things I did to my sister back then to both Lillian and Harold and also reminded Harold that I wasn't able to be a bridesmaid for our sister. I thanked Lillian for asking for me and because I was trying to make up for not being able to be a bridesmaid I offered to pay for Lillian's hair and makeup separately from my gift\n\nHarold and Lillian said that's not good enough and said I'm exaggerating my work situation. They want me to change my mind. Both of them are self-employed and control their own work schedules. Harold said I should just leave early or not go to work but if there's a fire or investigation that's not how it works and I can't just leave. I didn't think politely declining would be a big deal but Harold and Lillian flipped out and other people are getting involved and saying I was wrong.

She doesn\u2019t know the schedule for anything but the wedding. So no she can\u2019t just change her schedule 7 days prior because an alternate may not be available. Like most jobs she needs to request in advance and can not here.", "Not on short notice, no. There are lots of jobs where you can\u2019t just be like, \u201chey I need next Monday night off,\u201d without massively screwing up the lives and schedules of all your coworkers, and you especially can\u2019t do that multiple times over a period of months.", "Not at the last minute like that no. Holidays where the date is set the same every year (like Christmas Day) or floats but is always around the same time and known well in advance (like Thanksgiving) you can def work with to get off. If something comes up or is \u201cjust decided on\u201d less than like 2 weeks out it\u2019s extremely difficult to get off last minute.\n\nFire fighters/marshals, police, and dispatchers all have a rotating schedule like this (I\u2019m sure there are more jobs like this, I just know people with these jobs in particular) and it\u2019s specifically because they want you to know what time you\u2019re given so you can work around it.\n\nSo yeah, my friend who is a cop was able to take off time for her wedding and honeymoon but she had to plan it a year in advance. Where as when a friend no one had seen for years came into town unexpectedly, she wasn\u2019t able to get off to see them so she didn\u2019t come and missed them entirely. \n\nMAYBE if the bride was able to set all the dates and stick to them right now OP could swing it. But honestly if I were them I wouldn\u2019t want to participate at this point just based on Brother and SILs reactions/behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s the nature of the gig and it seems OP and OPs sister understands that. But their Brother and SIL don\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s due to them being self-employed and masters of their own time.

I work in a hospital setting and can never guarantee when I get off work and I was a MOH for my twin and a bridesmaid for my older sister and both of them were great- I flew out on a weekend I was available and got to watch them try on dresses, I shopped for specific shoes they wanted in my city, and got my hair done so they could test styles, etc. During the wedding I helped set up things and get things ready. It doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cyou come to all these appointments and pay for all of this and that,\u201d- Lillian and Harold need to come to their senses and realise other people aren\u2019t getting married, they are.", "NTA - this is extremely responsible of you. Imagine how pissed off she'd be if you had to skip things, then kick you out halfway through after you've paid for the things this causing even more drama. Better to nip this first drama in the bud rather than have it halfway through. \n\nAlso, the world doesn't revolve around their wedding, or anyone else's.

Even my bachelorette party was scheduled the evening after their dresses were delivered so it was all on the same day.

You're work schedule is basically set in stone yes you got the wedding day set aside but the same can't be said for the other days that your sister in law is demanding you need set aside for her, which isn't even set up by the way so you'll essentially be playing by ear in a ways if you agreed to be a bridesmaid, so getting those days set aside will be impossible because what if she set a date aside and then suddenly decided to reschedule? And for her and your brother to get all butt hurt because you declined says that they just wanted full commitment to basically have free service basically. To go as far as getting other people involved is an AH move on a whole different level. Now the question is do you really want to go to the wedding at this point?

I didn\u2019t have a bachelor/ette party, because our schedules weren\u2019t compatible (and financial reasons).

Then there's the shower, which you assist the MOH with.  Then, closer to the wedding, the bachelorette (personally I think the multi-day trips to Vegas etc. are way too much, but one evening or overnight if you're one of the bride's girls).  Finally, the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner the night before (I took off that whole day for my brother's wedding because the bride, two mothers and party got their nails done that afternoon instead of the wedding morning when we did our hair).

I hate stuff like this ITS A JOB a wedding is a once in a lifetime thing for them especially your brothers how inconsiderate of you to place your job over your own family", "lol her employer couldn't replace her in a heartbeat, nor many months of heartbeats.", "Well thank goodness not everyone in emergency services shares your view, otherwise who would we have to turn to in the event of emergencies?", "Family doesn't pay the bills and it is definitely not as fulfilling. \nOP doesn't have to shift her priorities, she's already made time for the wedding, she just doesn't have time to drop everything at a moment's notice to get her hair done when she may be called into court etc. Being a bridesmaid is basically a part-time wildly unpredictable job, not everybody can be your bridesmaid especially if you've got a bunch of ridiculous prerequisites. Getting annoyed at people and throwing a temper tantrum like a toddler because somebody can't be your bridesmaid is fucking pathetic. They just want free labour and OP is not required to do that for them, especially when her career is extremely important.", "OP may have been asked since they are good at putting out fires but I don't think the \"bride\" would like the investigation report showing she was the cause of every fire.", "Not weird for YOU maybe. It\u2019s weird not to be able to separate that bias though", "The fact that you would never have imposed on them is the reason why they were willing and even eager to do it. When people know you're not a taker, they want to give.", "Except it\u2019s not just the bridal shower and rehearsal dinner, she wants shopping trips and bachelorette parties and makeup and hair trials, etc. it\u2019s hard to find that many shift trades. The bride was not willing to compromise whatsoever.", "There\u2019s also needing to know if the cause is arson so a suspect can be located. The longer it takes the harder the person can be to track down before they strike again.\n\nAnd in the case of an appliance or some other electronic being the cause they need to know of this is a manufacture defect so they can issue a warning and recall. OPs job literally saves lives which takes priority over party planning.", "What is up with brides?  Being a bridesmaid is quickly becoming endentured servitude.  Her list of requirements is ridiculous.  Of course you are NTA.  I think that you handled everything most graciously.  Smile vaguely and move on, you dodged a bullet.", "Show up in full fire marshal gear just in case of emergency", "I heard they\u2019ll even light the candles on your birthday cake, free of charge.", "\"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power\" - misattributed to Abe Lincoln, rather that notable late 1800s public speaker Robert Ingersoll said it to say Lincoln had passed that test", "I love that quote, Alan, I think about it every now and then. Not strange at all!", "Exactly. It's not enough for them to be queen for a day. They think being The Bride makes them a celebrity or something."]}
