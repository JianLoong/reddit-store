I politely declined and explained why I couldn't. Harold and Lillian are extremely unhappy with my decision.\n\nI'm a fire marshal. I know it's called different things in different countries - my office investigates fires. Since fires don't just happen from Monday to Friday during business hours, I work all different shifts including overnight and on weekends. When Harold and Lillian announced their wedding date (shortly after the engagement and long before I was asked to be a bridesmaid) I checked my work schedule. My schedule is rotating and goes in a pattern so I can see it years in advance. I was scheduled to work on the day of the wedding. I arranged to switch with another marshal so I'm not working the day of the wedding. I've made sure I don't have to work and can attend the wedding and reception, otherwise that I'd be starting work before the ceremony starts and not finishing until after the reception ends.\n\nTo be a bridesmaid I would be expected to go to Lillian's dress appointments, to go on the group shopping trip to purchase the bridesmaid dresses, to help put together, host and clean up at the bridal shower, to go to the hair and makeup trial appointment, to help plan and go to the bachelorette party, to assist with things like making the centerpieces and decorating the reception room, to go to the the wedding rehearsal and dinner and more. Lilian has been up front about the commitment she wants. However with my work schedule I can't possibly do all that. The dates and times for those aren't set and have to work around Lillian's schedule foremost. I asked Lillian if I could be a bridesmaid and just go to the wedding and nothing else. She said no. Shee wants her bridesmaids committed to those things.\n\nMy sister asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and I couldn't do it for similar to reasons, on top of being in the middle of the biggest case of my career in the lead up to her wedding. My sister understood and didn't flip out like Lillian and Harold did. I explained the same things I did to my sister back then to both Lillian and Harold and also reminded Harold that I wasn't able to be a bridesmaid for our sister. I thanked Lillian for asking for me and because I was trying to make up for not being able to be a bridesmaid I offered to pay for Lillian's hair and makeup separately from my gift\n\nHarold and Lillian said that's not good enough and said I'm exaggerating my work situation. They want me to change my mind. Both of them are self-employed and control their own work schedules. Harold said I should just leave early or not go to work but if there's a fire or investigation that's not how it works and I can't just leave. I didn't think politely declining would be a big deal but Harold and Lillian flipped out and other people are getting involved and saying I was wrong.

She doesn\u2019t know the schedule for anything but the wedding. So no she can\u2019t just change her schedule 7 days prior because an alternate may not be available. Like most jobs she needs to request in advance and can not here.", "Not on short notice, no. There are lots of jobs where you can\u2019t just be like, \u201chey I need next Monday night off,\u201d without massively screwing up the lives and schedules of all your coworkers, and you especially can\u2019t do that multiple times over a period of months.", "Not at the last minute like that no. Holidays where the date is set the same every year (like Christmas Day) or floats but is always around the same time and known well in advance (like Thanksgiving) you can def work with to get off. If something comes up or is \u201cjust decided on\u201d less than like 2 weeks out it\u2019s extremely difficult to get off last minute.\n\nFire fighters/marshals, police, and dispatchers all have a rotating schedule like this (I\u2019m sure there are more jobs like this, I just know people with these jobs in particular) and it\u2019s specifically because they want you to know what time you\u2019re given so you can work around it.\n\nSo yeah, my friend who is a cop was able to take off time for her wedding and honeymoon but she had to plan it a year in advance. Where as when a friend no one had seen for years came into town unexpectedly, she wasn\u2019t able to get off to see them so she didn\u2019t come and missed them entirely. \n\nMAYBE if the bride was able to set all the dates and stick to them right now OP could swing it. But honestly if I were them I wouldn\u2019t want to participate at this point just based on Brother and SILs reactions/behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s the nature of the gig and it seems OP and OPs sister understands that. But their Brother and SIL don\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s due to them being self-employed and masters of their own time.

I work in a hospital setting and can never guarantee when I get off work and I was a MOH for my twin and a bridesmaid for my older sister and both of them were great- I flew out on a weekend I was available and got to watch them try on dresses, I shopped for specific shoes they wanted in my city, and got my hair done so they could test styles, etc. During the wedding I helped set up things and get things ready. It doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cyou come to all these appointments and pay for all of this and that,\u201d- Lillian and Harold need to come to their senses and realise other people aren\u2019t getting married, they are.", "NTA - this is extremely responsible of you. Imagine how pissed off she'd be if you had to skip things, then kick you out halfway through after you've paid for the things this causing even more drama. Better to nip this first drama in the bud rather than have it halfway through. \n\nAlso, the world doesn't revolve around their wedding, or anyone else's.

Even my bachelorette party was scheduled the evening after their dresses were delivered so it was all on the same day.

You're work schedule is basically set in stone yes you got the wedding day set aside but the same can't be said for the other days that your sister in law is demanding you need set aside for her, which isn't even set up by the way so you'll essentially be playing by ear in a ways if you agreed to be a bridesmaid, so getting those days set aside will be impossible because what if she set a date aside and then suddenly decided to reschedule? And for her and your brother to get all butt hurt because you declined says that they just wanted full commitment to basically have free service basically. To go as far as getting other people involved is an AH move on a whole different level. Now the question is do you really want to go to the wedding at this point?

If you do not like your brother, then that is one thing, however people who love you want to share their love, with you.", "Maybe concessions by both sides?", "I'm curious how anyone is going to be able to commit to all this? I think Lillian is is for a rude awakening when she realises people have lives and they don't revolve around her wedding.", "NTA OP, they have proven they don't respect you or your job, how the heck are you supposed to respect their wedding? I certainly don't. You should bow out altogether and make sure your sister knows the full story so *she* can spread it.", "It\u2019s \u201cfire marshal\u201d in the US. Or at least in every US jurisdiction I\u2019ve ever lived in. But I think sometimes there is a separate arson investigator.", "I have been a bridesmaid seven times and NEVER had to do any of this. But my friends chose weddings they or their families could afford.", "And imagine what would happen if OP accepted and then kept having to tell Bride she couldn\u2019t make it to various mandatory bridesmaid preparation events? Bride would make her life a living hell, and would probably hold it over her head forever that she didn\u2019t prioritize bride. Bride is going to be mad in any event, so OP is smart to just avoid the whole thing from the start! NTA!", "Right? I mean, my wedding was 30+ years ago, but I told my bridesmaids, \"Show up on this date wearing something in forest green.\" They looked glorious. But I wanted friends beside me, not unpaid labor (which is what it sounds like OP's SIL is hoping for).", "Exactly she wants free help and she resents that she can\u2019t get it.       \nThey are the bosses of their own companies so they may be used to calling the shots.", "It should not have been any work. What modern \"brides\" expect from their friends is insane.", "Yeah! The Bridal Couple forget it's a \"request\", not a \"summons.\"", "They're narcissistic people.\n\nA normal person hears \"no\" and they say ok and move on.\n\nThese people hear \"no\" and think \"obviously no means yes, just gotta keep pushing\"", "Thankfully where I am it's more usual for the couple to pay for the bridesmaids outfits etc", "I was a bridesmaid for my best friend and all I had to do was show up on the day. She paid for our outfits and makeup. She went dress shopping with her family members, and asked friends who she couldn't fit jnto the wedding party to plan her hen party which otherwise would have been my job but not a financial outlay.", "And this is insane to me, when I was planning my wedding I was prepared to do all the DIY with the focus on the Yourself, but so many friends and family members jumped on the chance of helping with invitations or flowers or favours to be useful. Obligation is key, I think. Had I guilted them it would be less of a spontaneous memory where we laughed over too much wine, and more of a chore. Instead it became little bits of my friends that shone from every detail.", "You got me there! \ud83e\udd23", "I'm not sure if you meant to reply to me. I'm not the OP.\n\nAll I can say is that I got married thirty years ago and didn't insist that my bridesmaids do most of that. They had to buy the dress I picked out and come to the rehearsal. \n\nDay and days of dancing attendance on the bride was unheard of back then. Helping out? Sure, if asked. Mandatory Bridesmaid Boot Camps - no. Completely ridiculous. It's clear that Lillian wants free labor, not OP's love & support.", "And that's the point of the wedding that op will be attending. Op does not need to be a bridesmaid for that. If they care about op, they'd understand that her job is important and she can't just drop everything on their whims.", "Not with such late notice, and anyway, if OP has PTO, maybe she doesn't want to use it to follow Lillian around doing her bidding because she (Lillian) thinks she's the center of the universe just because she's doing something that billions of people do.", "I did not realize until recently that people don't take into account what their guests can handle? I'm helping a friend with her wedding, and she and her fiance (typically, I assumed and was wrong) took into account where everyone in their lives were, what they could afford, and what would make sense. There isn't really an ideal city for everyone, but they found a place in the center with train, bus, flight access so everyone can get there based on their budget. \n\nThey totally could have done some destination thing, they have the budget for it if they're willing to give up 1/3 of the guests who couldn't afford it, but they weren't.", "I was a bridesmaid a few years ago and the bride sent us all a link to an $80 dress online, then we all stayed at the venue's hotel the night before the wedding and had a girl's night. Was low maintenance fun.", "All that sound be expected is showing up in a dress the bride picked out. I don't think the bridesmaids should buy the dress, but that's a common expectation. I think one night out celebration is reasonable. But multi day trips and bridal parties and engagement parties and everyone else is ridiculous to expect others to shell out for your life choices.", "Exactly! Two people decided to get married and all of sudden people are expected to drop everything to cater to them... especially the brides! When they decide to have a baby it become oh give us baby things too! Like when does it end? Where I'm from we don't stress bridesmaids,  food is paid for by the couple or their families. Just wear a dress that is usually within the budget of the bridesmaids and everyone agrees to. Dance in with the couple and look cute in pictures.\n\n\nEdited to add, that sometimes on Reddit you see couples expecting their train to cleanup and arrange chairs for the event! Like why?!", "My friend made us have monthly bridesmaid dinners for an entire year leading up to her wedding. Amongst other demands. We were over it by the time of the wedding.", "Seriously. Weve adopted a woman into our family. When she got married, she knew i hated being involved in weddings and my autistic ass is terrible with gatherings. She was super chill about me and my mom dipping not long into the reception.", "All I expected? \n\nChoose; be at my dress fitting to get fitted as well, or go to X dress store in your area by X date and get fitted, OR go to ANY tailor by x date and get measured then send it to X email to be added to my account. \n\nMy bridal shower was family only and was a surprise by my mother. \n\nBachelorette party was 2 days before the wedding so everyone was already gathering, and that was it.", "It's where they explain that her work is definitely flexible, as if they know more about it than she does, that really gives this game away.", "They could also be planning on relying on the wedding party for labor and funds. Plenty of stories of brides scamming people to finance the wedding.", "Exactly, I went in prepared to DIY all the things, basically by myself because I had more time than my husband-to-be. But to my surprise and delight, my dad, MoH and hub's best man all offered to chip in and worked their asses off. I was so, so grateful, but I would never, *ever* have asked them to do stuff. They offered and I gratefully accepted. Big difference.", "I didn't insist on everyone coming to do everything--some of my bridesmaids lived out of town, but most of them did do, and I think these are reasonable expectations:\n\n*  bridesmaids dress selection shopping trip (or live with the results and order your size based on your measurements)\n*  attend bridal shower (hosted by a family friend but otherwise usually this is a maid of honor task)\n*  attend bachelorette party (at a bar, one night, this was the 90s)\n*  go to wedding rehearsal and dinner\n\nEveryone did their own hair and makeup and chose their own shoes, no dye to match, I guess it was a simpler time and I think I was pretty laid back?", "I\u2019m getting married in 9 days and all of my bridesmaids live out of state. The first time I will see them is 3 days before the wedding. Then right in a row we\u2019ll do bachelorette, rehearsal, wedding, done. They were not asked to participate in the planning. My man of honor will carry the emergency kit and be the gopher on the day, but that\u2019s all we\u2019ve asked of anyone. The amount of stuff people ask of their attendants is crazy.", "It is out of control! Bridesmaids should throw a simple shower but not much else!", "And attend the ceremony rehearsal.", "Where I live we don't do bridesmaids, not bridal party, nor engagement parties, nor rehearsal... and people still manage to get married.", "There is bound to be a cultural blowback soon - come on Gen. Z!", "Because why spend money on venue attendants when you've got a guaranteed crew of bullied worker bees?", "not even laid back, you seemed to have a normal setup. people these days are spending more on weddings than their houses & that\u2019s not normal.", "Exactly. There is some level of commitment to be expected, but not to the extent that seems to be going on these days", "I think rehearsal is fair, yes."]}
