Lilian has been up front about the commitment she wants. However with my work schedule I can't possibly do all that.

I could then try to get time off but if I'm working and another marshal isn't available I wouldn't be able to go to whatever thing is scheduled. If I'm already subpoenaed to court and the hair trial is booked in seven days, I can't just skip court or tell the court I have a hair appointment. Lillian wants the commitment to come to all the things made to everything right now.", "That's a lot of time off just to be a bridesmaid. I dont think I'd be willing to sacrifice that much of my time and energy and lose holidays just to be a bridesmaid.", "No. Fire marshals can't just not go to work or decide to take time off when there's a fire.", "Hell no. With the commitment of time the bride is asking for I'd turn it down, too, and I don't even have the uncertainty in my job like OP does. \n\nJust because a couple invites you to be a member of the wedding party doesn't mean anyone has to accept. It's time consuming and expensive, and some brides - like this one - expect way too much.\n\nEta, OP is NTA", "I think in the UK / US the equivalent to Fire Marshal is a Fire Investigator, who does the forensic [fire investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_investigation) after a fire to identify if it has a criminal cause, what happened, was anyone responsible etc.\n\nNot said but because schedules are known so far in advance I think OP has to book holiday a long time in advance and not at short notice.\n\nAdditionally if OP did book a day to for a dress fitting on Wednesday but at work Tuesday & called to a fire investigation that then lasts 3 days she can't just turn around and say 'hey, this has to wait for a dress fitting'.", "This needed to be said, so thank you!", "It isn't just a case of finding the cause of the fire. I would assume that the insurance company would delay any payout of benefits until the Fire Marshall has made the determination. Would OP's brother and his bride be OK with waiting for replacement clothing, food and a place to stay because the Fire Marshall was busy making centerpieces?", "Your telling me that a fire marshal does not get time off for a holiday or to do anything.", "Exactly. From everything I\u2019ve heard being a bridesmaid is expensive. I\u2019d turn it down, too, because they are asking for so much and I really don\u2019t want to burn half my days off on someone else\u2019s wedding.", "She switched her schedule for the wedding. She can\u2019t switch her schedule for every little appointment and to plan things.", "What you aren\u2019t picking up on is a holiday is scheduled. She doesn\u2019t know the schedule for anything but the wedding. So no she can\u2019t just change her schedule 7 days prior because an alternate may not be available. Like most jobs she needs to request in advance and can not here.", "Not on short notice, no. There are lots of jobs where you can\u2019t just be like, \u201chey I need next Monday night off,\u201d without massively screwing up the lives and schedules of all your coworkers, and you especially can\u2019t do that multiple times over a period of months.", "Not at the last minute like that no. Holidays where the date is set the same every year (like Christmas Day) or floats but is always around the same time and known well in advance (like Thanksgiving) you can def work with to get off. If something comes up or is \u201cjust decided on\u201d less than like 2 weeks out it\u2019s extremely difficult to get off last minute.\n\nFire fighters/marshals, police, and dispatchers all have a rotating schedule like this (I\u2019m sure there are more jobs like this, I just know people with these jobs in particular) and it\u2019s specifically because they want you to know what time you\u2019re given so you can work around it.\n\nSo yeah, my friend who is a cop was able to take off time for her wedding and honeymoon but she had to plan it a year in advance. Where as when a friend no one had seen for years came into town unexpectedly, she wasn\u2019t able to get off to see them so she didn\u2019t come and missed them entirely. \n\nMAYBE if the bride was able to set all the dates and stick to them right now OP could swing it. But honestly if I were them I wouldn\u2019t want to participate at this point just based on Brother and SILs reactions/behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s the nature of the gig and it seems OP and OPs sister understands that. But their Brother and SIL don\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s due to them being self-employed and masters of their own time. But I\u2019m lead more to believe it\u2019s due to them being self-absorbed"]}
