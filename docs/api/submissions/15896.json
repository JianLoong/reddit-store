She has accused me of : \n\n\\- Telling her she would never be allowed around the baby alone because I\u2019ll never trust her. (She concluded this from me telling her I didn\u2019t feel safe going back to work right away because I didn\u2019t want to leave my baby alone with someone else) \n\n\\- Trashtalking her to my family (concluded from my mom asking her if I really said I\u2019d never leave anyone alone with the baby)\n\n\\- Making her cry by calling her a bad mother (me confronting her about the other family members saying I\u2019m mean for not letting her see the baby)\n\n\\- Calling her baby gifts stupid.

If she calls and he\u2019s not in the room with me, I go where he is or I decline her calls. I only call her if he\u2019s next to me. He hates it, she hates it and they\u2019re both annoyed at me. Honestly, my first reflex would have been to cut her off but she lures me back in whenever we\u2019re not alone and I feel blindsided, I thought we were friends.

I have had no issues with MIL cause I am not married to the favorite son.", "If Op goes this route, I would suggest texting MIL and telling her about recording the phone calls. That way, she has written proof in case MIL tries to cry upset about her son finding out what was actually said. Even for in person conversations, I'd go the same route.", "Or, don't answer her calls at all. Either they go to voice-mail or she calls your husband. She may not be able to legally record the calls.", "NTA, It sounds like your MIL is annoyed by these new boundaries because she can't get away with her shitty behavior. I think it's smart to keep your interactions public for the time being. However,  your husband hasn't observed the behavior, so from his point of view, it's annoying and unnecessary. I would encourage you to talk with your husband and explain to him that you want to persevere your relationship with MIL, and this is how you feel comfortable going forward for right now. \n\n\nNow, if you're a petty and messy bitch like I am, I would record the calls without her knowledge. If a problem comes up, you can go to the tapes and let people see what's really going on. Now, you might be considered an  AH for privately recording your calls with her, but this is a good way to catch her red-handed. This isn't great advice, but it's an option..", "NTA. Honestly I think your solution is perfect. Annoying for your MIL because now you have a witness and she can't start any more drama. Also annoying for your husband because he'd rather not be involved which is unfortunate. Any family member that is trying to start crap between you and another family member should be a group chat or in public. It is unfortunate but it does cut off the chance of creating drama. \nWe did this with my SIL after she tried to cause drama between my husband and when I wouldn't do what she wanted. My husband thinks it is annoying because he doesn't like to be bothered by group chats but he admits it keeps things simpler. It also allows him to step in when he feels she's gone too far. I also do this with my mother and siblings as she tends to create drama between us kids. If I just keep it public it limits the lies and drama.", "Clever girl \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "I mean this is how we deal with accusatory patients in the Healthcare setting it protects everyone. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f when MIL stops being a lying SOB she can be trusted again.", "If your husband has understood finally that there is a pattern of his mother misconstruing your words and making a big family drama, why on earth isn\u2019t he standing up for you and embracing your compromise?\n\nNTA.\n\nI\u2019d talk to my husband again about his lack of support and tell him you\u2019re sick of fighting and it\u2019s not your fault when you do. He needs to get his head out of his ass and help you deal with this.\n\nEdit: another thing you can do is also just blast share your text messages with MIL to people and see what they think lol. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t do this as it\u2019d create more drama, but damn, the pettiness I feel is a strong motivator. \n\nAnother option: tell MIL you want to have a conversation with her about the drama and her constantly misunderstanding you. Protect yourself by either (a) recording it, and/or (b) asking someone to meditate and be there too. And also let her know if you are recording. A frank conversation about how your trust in her has been seriously damaged. She doesn\u2019t trust that you have good intentions, and you can\u2019t trust that she is a safe person to be honest or yourself around. Because of that, you\u2019re distancing yourself from her because her misunderstandings has had terrible consequences on your relationship with everyone in the family and your husband, and you\u2019re exhausted. If she wants to fix this she needs to gain your trust back, but otherwise, you will always talk to her with a third party there because that\u2019s the only solution you can think of", "NTA! You've been backed into a corner not only by MIL but by your husband who is believing his mom over you!

Trust me when I tell you, it is amazing that you recognize this in her. I did not recognize it for many years after my first child, and it was awful.  \n\nYou need to cut contact with her now. If your husband doesn\u2019t wanna deal with his own mother, that is his problem and not yours. You did not sign on for this and trust me. When I tell you, it only gets worse.  She is targeting you and the more control she has over your life the more she will wield it.  \n\nYou will find a lot of support r/justnomil.  Also, I suggest reading stop walking on egg shells by Randy Krueger.  Read as much as you can about narcissistic manipulation tactics and how to defend yourself against them.  Read about grey rocking.  We are no contact with my MIL and it has been the best decision ever. I took a long time for my husband to see the light. If your husband is not a united front with you It will be hard.  r/justnoso is all about this.  Do not be his meat shield!  His mother, his problem!", "NTA\n\nYou're not causing issues or drama. You are reacting to a situation MIL created. And you're doing everything right. H should have to deal with his own parents.", "NTA.  You can also stop talking her calls completely.  Everytime she calls just text your husband and let him know you missed a call from his mom and you don't have time to call her back.  Can he call her to see what she needs?  I suspect he realizes how crazy and manipulative she is and is annoyed because he doesn't want to deal with her.", "NTA. \n\nIf his mom wants to be involved in your lives, he can manage that relationship. Don\u2019t make yourself available, don\u2019t go running to be in a room with him when she wants to talk to you. Just stop answering altogether. She\u2019ll learn to call him instead, eventually. He has a phone, right?\n\nAnd the next time you are tempted to think of her as a friend, remember \u201cfool me twice, shame on me.\u201d", "NTA. I did this, too, under different circumstances. I required my husband to be in the same room with me at all times when around his mother.\n\nIt took a few weeks for her to be unable to NOT say something crappy to or about me, and he finally saw what I'd been telling him for 17 years. \n\nKeep it up. Do not back down.", "GOOD CHOICE! NTA\nI think SO needs to wake up to her antics and support you before this escalates.\nBest of luck & congrats to you and your husband!", "This is such a great solution, NTA", "Either start strategizing ways to meet and defeat the pettiness, or stand firm on the decision to stay removed from MIL (knowing this will inspire issues with family I\u2019m sure) maybe have a heart to heart, recognize that she\u2019s sensitive but you want to be on the same team, give it one honest go and decide if it\u2019s worth a relationship from there.. \n\n     ** petty idea: Overkill with kindness.. then make her responsible for things you need done - micromanage and then shower her with applause and gratitude. Better to manage her when she\u2019s under your thumb. If she complains about you, then she\u2019s the bad guy for not wanting to help her sons pregnant wife.", "Nta.

This all *isn\u2019t ABOUT her*. \n\n*You* are pregnant, stress is not good for you nor your child, and anyone who insists on bringing stress and increasing drama has no place in your pregnancy. Period. You have exactly zero obligation to pander to a jealous grandma drama queen, in fact it is your *responsibility* to start making every possible effort to nurture all that serves you, and disengage from all that does not. \n\nAnd your husband needs to get on board with that all, bc it\u2019s *his JOB* right now (and hopefully moving forward indefinitely!!) is to shield both his wife and his child from the harmful behavior of his own mother/family. He has decisions to make, but at this point he needs to choose the family he participated in creating, and IF *he* wants to wrangle his mom, then *he* needs to do so. And if *he* chooses to continue to engage with/cater to her, that\u2019s a conversation he needs to have with you, and for which very clear, very clearly communicated boundaries are in place.  \n\nNTA, not remotely, and I really truly deeply hope you are able to mentally/emotionally protect yourself, using whatever you need to as a buffer, because people like her don\u2019t typically change, and you can make yourself crazy trying to get through to them or get them to understand \u201cyour side\u201d. It\u2019s next to impossible, and even the smallest inch of progress requires herculean efforts, and it\u2019s just\u2026 not worth it. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry, and wish you the easiest, calmest, most peaceful pregnancy and all the love and support you can handle on your journey in to motherhood!", "Yeah sounds just like my mom.
