She has accused me of : \n\n\\- Telling her she would never be allowed around the baby alone because I\u2019ll never trust her. (She concluded this from me telling her I didn\u2019t feel safe going back to work right away because I didn\u2019t want to leave my baby alone with someone else) \n\n\\- Trashtalking her to my family (concluded from my mom asking her if I really said I\u2019d never leave anyone alone with the baby)\n\n\\- Making her cry by calling her a bad mother (me confronting her about the other family members saying I\u2019m mean for not letting her see the baby)\n\n\\- Calling her baby gifts stupid. (I didn\u2019t want to use pacifiers and she had bought a ton of them already)\n\nI\u2019m tired of this cycle of her creating drama from things I told her when we are alone and me being mad followed by her crying saying she misunderstood.

If she calls and he\u2019s not in the room with me, I go where he is or I decline her calls. I only call her if he\u2019s next to me. He hates it, she hates it and they\u2019re both annoyed at me. Honestly, my first reflex would have been to cut her off but she lures me back in whenever we\u2019re not alone and I feel blindsided, I thought we were friends.

As a child you end up with whatever parents you have. As a spouse, you pick your partner, and they pick you.

You need a counselor. \n\nSorry but it\u2019s very clear she is lying and or took things poorly without any critical thinking. \n\nHe\u2019s staunchly pretending to be in the middle. Nope. He believes you and advocates for you or he doesn\u2019t. He isn\u2019t; so he doesn\u2019t.\n\nOr: he does believe you but because it\u2019s his mother, he\u2019s decided to act like this is \u201cwomen\u2019s drama\u201d that he doesn\u2019t need to br involved in. \n\nBut this woman told others. She wanted you to be attacked. \n\nInsist on counseling because that can\u2019t continue.", "I\u2019m also at a loss that OP mentions her husband \u201cthinks it\u2019ll destroy my relationship with her [MIL]\u201d\u2026 hasn\u2019t that ship already sailed?\n\nIf my MIL was spreading rumors about me to family and actively making up stories that made me look bad, I\u2019d have cut her out of my life so quickly. Husband can talk to his mom all he wants, but I would not engage. I wouldn\u2019t be putting in this effort to keep talking to her but making sure my husband was there as a character witness. It\u2019s simply not worth the headache.", "Since the husband is annoyed, I think OP should start recording all calls instead of going to him. Maybe he will believe if OP has proof of MILs behaviour.", "NTA. MIL is only annoyed because she can't snipe at you in private and use your responses to play the victim. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "She's inserting herself as the third (read: first) parent. She's also brewing up some post partum for OP via triangulation so she'll be more likely to hand the baby off, to her of course, faster.", "And she's pregnant, so why isn't he shielding her from all of this foolishness? Everyone knows you're not supposed to upset pregnant people.", "Also, why does husband think conversations about his child and wife have nothing to do with him? Husband doesnt want to babysit phone calls between two adults, he wont want to watch his own kid, and will let MIL do what she wants.", "No. \n\nOP is not responsible for any stress this has caused her husband.", "Yes, this is the way.", "Good point. But OP still needs to work this out with her husband. His attitude/behavior is troubling. NTA.", "This is not about who is responsible or not. This is about going forward with hopefully a better relationship among everyone and having peace again."]}
