She was incredibly sweet to me ever since I got with my husband, she and I had built a very close relationship until I got pregnant. Obviously, now it all fell apart. I\u2019m 5 months along and in the past 5 months, she has misconstrued several private conversations between me and her and made it into family wide drama. She has accused me of : \n\n\\- Telling her she would never be allowed around the baby alone because I\u2019ll never trust her. (She concluded this from me telling her I didn\u2019t feel safe going back to work right away because I didn\u2019t want to leave my baby alone with someone else) \n\n\\- Trashtalking her to my family (concluded from my mom asking her if I really said I\u2019d never leave anyone alone with the baby)\n\n\\- Making her cry by calling her a bad mother (me confronting her about the other family members saying I\u2019m mean for not letting her see the baby)\n\n\\- Calling her baby gifts stupid. (I didn\u2019t want to use pacifiers and she had bought a ton of them already)\n\nI\u2019m tired of this cycle of her creating drama from things I told her when we are alone and me being mad followed by her crying saying she misunderstood. She\u2019s always normal and her \u201c\u201dold\u201d\u201d self when other people are around. The worst part was convincing my husband each time I did NOT say those things. It has created a LOT of fights between me and him. \n\nSo I decided he has to be present whenever I\u2019m around her. I only text her through a group chat that includes him. If she calls and he\u2019s not in the room with me, I go where he is or I decline her calls. I only call her if he\u2019s next to me. He hates it, she hates it and they\u2019re both annoyed at me. Honestly, my first reflex would have been to cut her off but she lures me back in whenever we\u2019re not alone and I feel blindsided, I thought we were friends. I think we can keep a semblance of a relationship this way. \n\nAm I doing too much?

Be very clear with husband and MIL that you find this communication to be necessary to prevent any further misunderstandings. Say it will stay like until everyone is clear that you are not ever saying bad things about MIL and the two of you can regain your warm relationship by this style of communication.

That might alleviate some tension with hubby and it keeps MIL in check.\n\nGood luck and congratulations on your upcoming arrival.", "NTA.\n\nThe decision to have, and the responsibility to provide and care for this child is yours and your husbands; and therefore so are the parenting decisions. \n\nYour MIL is feeling left out because she hasn't completely come to terms with the fact that her son is a grown man, and his life is no longer her decision. \n\nAs a result, she is trying to wedge herself into your life, and come between you and your husband. The hope would be (and it appears to be the case here) that it is without malice, but regardless it is still happening. \n\nThis child is yours and your husbands, not hers. She may advise (but only if you choose to let her), she cannot demand or dictate. And she needs to be told this by your husband - directly.\n\nYour husband needs to understand that this is part of his job - to be the \"buffer\" and the \"referee\" between you and his family, just as it is your job between him and your family.\n\nHe also needs to understand that when it doubt he needs to take your side. This should become (and actually already be) an automatic response on his part, just as it should be on yours.\n\nMy father always explained it like this, and I agree: As a parent, you decide to have a child, but you do not pick which child you get. As a child you end up with whatever parents you have. As a spouse, you pick your partner, and they pick you. The person you decide to be with should always be  your first priority, the people life chooses for you should always come after.\n\nIf he can't do this, then I would suggest you keep on the same path you are on - do not be in the same room with her alone, don't engage her directly without someone else present.\n\nThis pregnancy is not about her. It is about you and your baby, and then your husband.\n\nJust my opinion....", "NTA.  I don't blame you one bit.  She's created this problem and you've found a solution.

Bravo.", "**NTA, 100%.** You're covering your own ass, and you don't need the stress and drama at this time. You're ensuring that the people around you can see that you're not being awful to her. Some MILs are just crazy, and you got unlucky there. I'm sorry to hear that. \n\nI'm more concerned actually why he's annoyed at you about this. I get it's frustrating and he feels in the middle, and I understand him not wanting to fracture any relationship he has with his mother, but you're his wife, and carrying his child.

But I would be very concerned. \n\nShe wants you to return to work as soon as possible.  Is she expecting to be your childcare?

Would he seriously rather her causing fights between the two of you than just be present for your conversations?? How lazy to complain about just being in the same room as you during your convos with her! \n\n She has repeatedly tried to ruin your relationship with your husband(WHILE YOURE CARRYING HIS CHILD), she's repeatedly tried to ruin your relationships with family members, she is constantly accusing you of malicious intentions while going around purposefully trying to cause harm, and then hiding behind her \"I misunderstood\" nonsense. If she has \"misunderstood\" at multiple times, wouldn't she prefer to have someone who will help clear the air BEFORE she hurts her own feelings?

Why does she need to have all these one on one calls or texts with you in the first place? She needs to get a life and get a grip.", "NTA in the very least. Dear God I'm so sorry you have to deal with this bs. I think you're handling it the best way you can. I don't think during down right now would work either.  She insists on normalizing herself when others are around, so what good will that do? She's damn near gaslighting her pregnant DIL. Maybe try to smooth it out abit with her by planning a girl's spa day with you, MIL, and a couple others so she knows you really aren't trying to cut her out, but others are around so she won't go psycho on you. \n\nGood luck!!", "It won't--since he seems inclined to be on her side, you'll be outnumbered and ganged up on.", "There's no guarantee, of course. If your goal is to get back to a somewhat neutral territory YOU will be less stressed. MIL took it way too personally rather than putting herself back in your position and remembering how difficult it can be to leave your baby to go back to work."]}
