How can she expect to maintain this agreement for important life events and emergencies?", "NTA, it was an emergency situation and if she can't handle being around you for a short period of time she needs some serious therapy. Yes OP cheated and that can be heartbreaking, but the fact she can't even put her emotions aside for her daughter's health and safety is deeply concerning. I know cheating is wrong but it's not like OP physically or verbally abused her for years and she fears for her life or safety. OP did the right thing contacting her about their daughter's accident and expecting OP to leave for hours while his daughter is hurt is an AH move.", "NTA. You're doing what you need to do: being there for your daughter when she needs you the most. If Mary can't put on her big girl pants and act like an adult for the sake of that poor child, then she can go pound sand. As there's a limit to how much should be tolerated and when someone should just tell her to shut up and get over herself.", "NTA. What you did sucked, but you acknowledge that and you're trying to do best by your daughter. She can be as angry as she wants, but none of her implementations are realistic in terms of having to deal with your child jointly for the next 13 years (at minimum), as shown by this one emergency. Your ex needs to figure out how to handle seeing your face or come up with a better plan for things like this, because in this particularly instance, you didn't do anything wrong. You've been respecting her requests for space and a go between for 3 years. This emergency superseded that and I'd be more concerned that she seems to just want you to disappear entirely out of her life or not exist when that's clearly not an option. \n\nIt sucks for her and I feel bad that she's this angry still, but unless you're hiding information about being an abusive monster or you have seven secret love children and you trapped her into a marriage/baby, this is something she does need to 'suck up', at least in terms of the well-being of her child, who I presume she gives a diddly about.", "NTA- to most people, trips to the hospital require immediate notification. But if she doesn\u2019t want notice, or only wants notice through some other party, just get it in writing", "Nta in this. You had EVERY RIGHT to be there at the hospital. Your ex needs to realize the world does not revolve around her.", "Children, first. Always.\nYour daughter had a serious accident and spent a few days in the damn hospital.\nYour daughter needed both parents.\nNTA", "NTA. I understand you hurt her, but it's been 3 years. She's holding on to something that she needs to let go of. You can't co-parent properly if she's going to be uncomfortable with you forever. She can't keep you blocked forever either. You need to be able to get a hold of her in emergencies. \n\nIt was your day to be with your daughter. There was no reason for you to leave. You daughter deserves both of you there in these type of situations. Your ex wife might need therapy if she can't let this go. \n\nI understand hurt, but she needs to think about the little girl.", "NTA and this arrangement hurts your daughter the most. I would recommend looking into Our Family Wizard or other software program for a more healthy co-parenting relationship or at least a healthier parallel parenting. It\u2019s not feasible to always communicate through your in-laws.\nWhat happens if her mom becomes ill. No judge is going to look at her behavior and think it\u2019s acceptable. If she isn\u2019t going to be a team player with a co-parenting software i would advice you to contact your previous lawyer to arrange communication on her lack of co-parenting. Your parenting plan likely includes standard terminology regarding co-parenting and she is likely in contempt of that court order. This emergency situation shows you used all means necessary to inform her that Sally needed emergency care. This is exactly what you should have done and you both  should have the right to visit her while she is in the hospital.", "NTA. If you are in the US, there is an app Our Family Wizard. Its a 3rd party way for parents to communicate and is admissible in court. I would recommend it, that way there is a record of all contact and you can show you are not contacting unreasonably/inappropriately. And anything outside that is her issue to manage.", "NTA-The situation was extreme and you responded accordingly. I\u2019d send a message to Mary via her mom simply stating that you respect her boundaries day-to-day, but that when it comes to an emergency with Sally, it is important that you both can be informed (meaning you can get in touch with her) and both be there for your daughter.", "NTA. You acted in good faith to let the mother know about an injury. You also had every right to stay at the hospital to support your daughter. \n\nSounds like you could iron this out in an agreement on how to handle emergencies and who her emergency contacts are. \n\nI assume you don\u2019t have a restraining order or anything like that in place and this is just your ex\u2019s way of coping.", "NTA - it was an emergency and she should have put her own issues aside for the good of your daughter.\n\nObviously some rare exceptions will have to be made for your deal. You seem to be the more responsible party despite what you did.", "NTA, she needs to learn to co-parent. She also needs to learn to move on and do what\u2019s best for her child. Life is full of hard and awkward situations. That child should be able to have both parents their in her time of need no matter what. She needs to get over herself.", "NTA. Text MIL back and ask if the mother is saying she does not want to be notified of emergency situations.", "Let's get this right. \n\nYou did the best for your daughter in a very scary situation. \n\nYou exhausted all previous efforts until it came to your last resort. \n\nMary still holds so much resentment for you that she cannot fathom you two being in the same vicinity together even in the case that your daughter is in the hospital. \n\nThis doesn't excuse what you did in the past by any means. But you are also *right*. \n\nMary needs to find a way to communicate with you. This isn't okay. \n\nYou two don't have to be friends or speak past just letting each other know if there's an emergency, but there ***HAS*** to be that kind of relationship between you two if you do have 50/50 with Sally, for ***Sally's*** sake. As her parents, you can't go through a third party in the case of an emergency if the other person is available. You are her *parents*. Both of you. \n\nWhether you like each other or not, that's not for anyone to decide, but as her parents, both being in the picture, there needs to be a level of communication where you can safely advise one another of the status of your daughter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, OP.", "NTA.  You were thinking of your daughter first.", "NTA. Mary needs to do some maturing... FAST. You share a child, and it is preposterous that your agreement states the two of you never speak to one another directly. Parenting only becomes **more** complicated the further you go, so that facet of the agreement needs to go away ASAP, especially if Mary is going to hold to it even in emergent situations.", "NTA - it sounds like your \u201cdeals\u201d need to get ironed out a bit more though. \n\nI\u2019d ask her what happens if there\u2019s another emergency and Mary\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t answer? What if it\u2019s life-threatening? Are there other people I can call? Is there any situation where it\u2019s appropriate to call Mary? \n\nDraw the lines more specifically for these \u201cwhat-if\u201d situations, and keep using your judgement. Maybe Mary doesn\u2019t think you made the right choice for Mary, but think you made the right choice for Sally.", "This is not sustainable. NTA", "NTA This is about both parents being there for their daughter regardless of history. It isn\u2019t about you two, and differences need to be put aside when the child you share is in the hospital. It\u2019s not about the past, it\u2019s about your daughter\u2019s present.", "NTA. Good grief. Yes, you screwed up your marriage but the time to put interpersonal conflict aside is when it comes to the wellbeing of the children. She should indeed, suck it up.", "NTA Regardless of what happened in the past and how she feels about you this was an emergency involving your shared child. This agreement sounds totally bogus and damaging to your daughter. I also don\u2019t understand how you can have such specific things laid out but nothing in place for emergencies. You need to go back to your lawyer and get this changed using this experience for the reason why. If you didn\u2019t contact her about the emergency and she found out after the fact you know 100% she\u2019d be taking your ass to court to take away what little time you have with your daughter. You are allowed to stay at the hospital to support your daughter regardless of your ex wives feelings. This isn\u2019t about her needs this is about your daughters needs, she deserves to have both parents there to support her.", "NTA\n\nHer boundaries are the equivalent of a soft-restraining order, so it seems only correct that she abide by the same terms, which is that she can't tell you to leave just because she goes to an area where you're at. You may have agreed to stay away from her, but by the very nature of coming to the hospital she was coming somewhere's she knew you to be and simply has to suck up the fact that the world has both of you in it and you're both involved in your daughters life.\n\nAs others have said, there are better alternatives to, \"direct communication\" other than your ex-mil.", "NTA - holy crap. My ex was an abusive a-hole, liar, and repetitive cheater, but at the end of the day the kids were always first for both of us. He tried a few times to make things difficult but pulled his head in pretty quickly. \n\nYou are very much NTA in this instance. She needs counselling and you need to review your parenting arrangements. This is going to get messier in future otherwise.", "NTA. This was an emergency. You're her father. Obviously the marriage ending was awful and what you did was awful. But it was 3 years ago and again, this was an emergency. You're right for standing up for yourself. Sally deserves both parents there when she's in that kind of position. Regardless of their issues with each other.", "So a 5 yo girl is in the hospital hurt and scared and her mom thinks HER confort comes first. It doesn't. Sally is the priority here. Mary has to suck it up and accept that you are the father and that's not gonna change. She has every right to hate you, but she has no right to put herself before Sally, and that's what she's doing. Yes, the situation sucks, you screwed up WITH MARY, but you're still Sally's dad. You BOTH have to do what's best for Sally. Again, SHE'S THE PRIORITY HERE, NOT MARY. NTA at all", "NTA. Look, you fucked up. You know this, we know this. That's not the point of this though. You have a daughter that was injured and instead of being concerned about her daughter she was mad that you told her that her daughter was injured when no one else was answering. I don't think you could have won with this no matter how you got her the information.", "NTA. She does need to suck it up and deal. Yeah you screwed up the marriage but now yall need to figure out how to focus on your kid. The arrangement sounds dysfunctional at best. You were in a no win situation here. If you call you're breaking the agreement. If you didn't call no doubt you'd be yelled at because it's her daughter! and so on.", "NTA - you were focussed on your daughter, which is the priority, and frankly your ex should focus on your daughter too. If she doesn't want to be around you, she is welcome to leave, but, absent a court order, she is unreasonable for asking you to leave. She needs to grow up and act like an adult.", "NTA. My marriage ended because my ex couldn't keep it in his pants. Yes I was heartbroken and at first it was so incredibly hard to see him and be around him especially when he had a gf but you know what I did, I sucked it up because my son deserved better. She needs to get over it because eventually your daughter will want both of y'all at events if she doesn't already. She is a child and shouldn't have to choose which parent is going to be at events. Yes cheating on her def made you an a$$ and I know from experience how much being cheated on sucks but she needs to put on her big girl panties and do what's best for y'all's daughter b", "NTA. Your ex-wife needs therapy. It's been 3 years. The arrangement is ridiculous if your ExMIL isn't going to answer her phone.", "NTA. You both needed to be there as long as you were respecting your ex wife's space. \n\nBut they make joint custody apps for situations like this where you can mark communication urgent or emergency. This might be a better plan for the future.", "NTA stay in that room with your baby.", "NTA, it was an emergency", "NTA sally comes first and deserves both her parents in emergencies (and frankly at sporting events and activities too)  as a mom idc if satan himself has to call me, someone better let me know asap if my kid is injured, but that's just me prioritizing my kids over my pettiness", "NTA\n\nDimes to doughnuts, she would have pitched a fit if your daughter was in and out of the hospital without you notifying her.", "NTA. \n\nYour child had a head injury. You acted in best interest of the child by informing her as soon as possible and by being present for the child. Nowhere did you actively plan to cause trouble or push boundaries. You're both adults, and sometimes adults have to do uncomfortable things for the sake of the child.", "NTA for this situation. Your ex needs therapy to learn how to cope with your betrayal. Refusing to see you is fine, but it's not part of a legal custody agreement. \n\nIt's her choice of coping with this situation, but it's in no way what's best for your kid. She's the parent, not her mother.", "NTA - her saying she was uncomfortable is manipulative, your child is in hospital so you suck it up and be there for your child who is scared and in pain. And you were in a no win situation, if you\u2019d don\u2019t call she was have made you the bad guy and you did call so you\u2019re the bad guy.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  She would have gone ballistic if you didn\u2019t let her know about Sally\u2019s injury right away.", "NTA, Mary needs to grow TF up already and stop acting like she can behave like a middle school kid in a fight. She needs to be willing to communicate with you because you share a kid!", "If she wants to be super literal, it was clearly *your* parenting time. So if she was so distressed by your presence, she could have left, since it was your time with Sally. \n\nOf course, that would be stupid. It\u2019s better for Sally for both of you to be there. But just saying. \n\nNTA", "Gonna go NTA. Seems like your ex was more worried about her comfort than the well-being of your daughter. Like the first thing she does when she gets there is yell at you about violating the agreement and demand you leave because of her comfort? Your daughter was hurt! She's in the hospital. I feel like that should take precedence here. Maybe I'm interpreting this wrong but to me it feels like your wife would rather not know about the well-being of her daughter so long as that means she doesn't talk to you. If her daughter was seriously hurt, she'd rather be completely oblivious and not be there as opposed to taking a phone call from you informing her of what's going on.\n\nNTA, OP.", "NTA. Stop using your ex-MIL as a messenger. Request the courts order all communications take place using an app like Our Family Wizard. Your ex needs to grow up and communicate with you about your (plural) shared daughter.", "NTA. Your ex is being completely unreasonable. \n\nHer boundary is unreasonable. She needs to get over it and learn to communicate with you as coparents. Having to go through her mommy is just petty and childish.", "NTA. You\u2019ve taken responsibility, but at this point what she\u2019s trying to do is just SCREAMING parental alienation which will really only deeply wound Sally. Sally had a traumatic event and was in the hospital. As her father, not even hell itself should keep you from her bedside, and you made sure your baby knew that. She had both parents. As it should be. Because it wasn\u2019t about either you or Mary. It was about your baby girl.", "In this situation, NTA. The thing with ugly divorces is that the parents don\u2019t take responsibility. She is not responsible for the cheating of course but you are both responsible for how the divorce is handled. She is sad and angry at you but it is her couple problem, not family problem. So yes she is the AH because right now she is prioritizing her personal problems over the well being of her daughter. My parents divorced because of cheating and it was ugly, and I saw many ugly divorces for the same reason.. every time one of the parents wouldn\u2019t get over their personal grudge, it affected the child. And believe me, when the child grow up they don\u2019t care who cheated on who, they care which parent is not taking responsibility to have a functioning family environment.", "NTA. People should stop with the continued use of the word \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 to try and justify their point of view.\nWould OP\u2019s wife have preferred to never see his face again? Probably. \n\nWas the way OP handled their daughters accident the best compromise? Definitely.\n\nThe ex-wife should realize there is no life without feeling uncomfortable now and then.", "Nta, it's pretty pathetic that a grown adult can't put aside her issues for the sake of her child, especially in an emergency.", "NTA, she made the situation about herself instead of her daughter. Clearly she needs to at least put that aside and let you know what\u2019s going on.", "NTA, she is acting ridiculous. This is way too much acrimony over a ONS and putting your child in the middle like a pawn. She needs to grow up", "NTA. Your daughter is the one paying the price for all this.", "100% NTA\u2026you shouldn\u2019t have cheated years ago but now your daughter is priority #1. Mom needs to put her daughter first and forget about who you fucked. Life moves on.", "NTA. Sorry ex is uncomfortable but your daughters physical and mental health is more important. Your ex is trying to make sure your daughter hates you too. It\u2019s not on the kid at all. Your wife needs to do better and be a better parent. \n\nGlad you stood up for yourself.", "NTA she needs to get her head out of her arse. You're both her parents and she's making it hard to do that, it was an emergency and she expects her mother to play middleman no matter the circumstances? She's delusional. Good luck for the next 13 years.", "NTA, your ex wife needs to lose this anger she\u2019s carrying around. At some point your daughter is doing to want both of you together at an event.", "I pity your daughter. Having her parents act like the other is poison isn\u2019t healthy at all. Stop playing into Mary\u2019s immature behavior and both of you need to always put your daughter first. NTA", "NTA.\nMy ex cheated our entire freaking marriage and we just had parent teacher conferences that we both sat at because they\u2019re OUR kids. I even have full custody. Like that\u2019s for the betterment of the kids if you can be civil to each other. My lord we exchange kids at each other\u2019s homes and everything. I cannot imagine having my ex blocked because I\u2019m too emotional he cheated. I get it if you were abusive but it sounds like she needs to heal up. I\u2019d want to know if my kid was hurt period.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter being hospitalized is an obvious exception to the agreement.", "NTA. A hospital visit seems like extenuating circumstance to me.", "NTA that\u2019s just dumb. Your adults act like them", "NTA.  This was an emergency and she needs to grow up!  As a parent you have to learn there are times (a lot of them) when your kid comes first. I hope overtime Mary can coparent amicably. My parents divorced when I was 17. I\u2019m 39. They STILL can\u2019t be in the same room together. It\u2019s caused me to dread all major events in my life where they may come in contact. Yes even to this day they are like this \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "NTA.  Her right to know AND your right to be with your daughter in a situation like this trumps absolutely everything that isn't a court order.", "NTA, your fuck up isn\u2019t an excuse for your ex wife to stop being a mother. It\u2019s not about her, or you or your guy\u2019s past marriage. It\u2019s about your daughter, you should always put your child first.", "NTA - sure you cheated and that\u2019s terrible. My former spouse cheated and left as well. But the kids need both parents, and you have to get to a point of being civil even if it\u2019s for limited time.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe she blocked your number, I just can\u2019t imagine doing that\u2026. And not being reachable in an emergency.  Feel like there\u2019s more to the story here.", "NTA. Your focus was on your daughter as it should be. Your ex's focus was on her. Unless that agreement was in the divorce decree, you are not legally required to honor it in addition this was an emergency and your ex couldn't be bother to understand that.\n\nThe fact she has you blocked says more about her than you.", "your ex wife needs to grow up. yeah, it sucked that you cheated on her but if there was nothing else going on like domestic violence etc, there is no reason to act this childish. her daughter was hurt and had to go to the hospital for fucks sake, thats way more important than making sure you arent there. you have a right to be there too since you re Sallys father.\n\nhonestly i feel sorry for your daughter.\n\nnta.", "NTA (assuming it\u2019s a personal arrangement and not court ordered).\n\nMary managed to temporarily put aside her grievances with you so you could both be with your daughter at the hospital.\n\nSuggest MIL does the same.", "NTA. But this isn\u2019t sustainable. Your ex sounds unhinged because her comfort was more important than her daughter being in the hospital.", "NTA after 3 years she should have been able to get to a point of being coparents.", "You are not the asshole. Her opinion of you has no bearing on you caring for your daughter. Especially in crisis.\n\nYou could be an asshole (not advised) and say to mother in law/Mary via text that you are glad to know she should not be contacted in cases of emergency. That's really good for you if deciding to attempt full custody or increase custody rights.\n\nBut no, contacting her mom due to crisis is not an asshole move. That's normal and it sounds like Mary is selfish and more concerned about herself than her daughters wellbeing.", "NTA- Honestly go to court and see if you can get court order family therapy.", "Nta and she\u2019s being super petty because you cheated on her. This is not in the child\u2019s best interest at all", "Nta, your child comes first, Mary should get counseling", "NTA. However since your ex-wife wants to carry this out, Cover Your Ass. I hope you have texts talking about how she confirmed this was an emergency and you both needed to focus on Sally and be there for her because if she fought like she did over custody, I can see her running to the courts with this to try and get full custody, specially since the accident happened at your parents' house.", "NTA.\n\nyes you did what you did 3 YEARS AGO! All your trying to do is do right for your child and being there for her. Your ex needs to suck it up and think of her daughter first before her own self. Child comes first. You did the right thing by calling her.", "NTA. This arrangement is stupid and childish. Mary shouldn\u2019t have proposed it and you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it. A scenario like the one you were in was totally foreseeable. This is what happens when two adults put more focus on keeping the peace between each other than doing what\u2019s best for the child. Sally deserves to have both of her parents front and center for every moment of her life at the same time, instead of you guys supporting her in shifts. This arrangement needs to end for Sally\u2019s sake and someone in her life needs to advocate that.", "NTA.\n\nYour ex needs to grow the up. She divorced you for cheating on her. You aren\u2019t married anymore, you don\u2019t live tougher, you don\u2019t hang out, you aren\u2019t friends. All that is fine.\n\nBut what does she think the rest of your daughter\u2019s life is going to look like? \n\nWhat happens when the school calls because she\u2019s sick and needs to be picked up? Are you prohibited from attending graduation? Is she going to insist that your daughter have two separate weddings? Once her mom dies, who is going to handle \u201cwarning\u201d her that you might be existing somewhere in the world? \n\nHer mother also needs to stop enabling this nonsense. You are all adults. Time to act like it. Treat each other like work colleagues. Completely fine to hate each other, but you have to be respectful and professional about it.", "Seems like a petty thing to complain about when your child is injured. It should have been understandable that you would want to be close by in the early hours of the event. As long as nobody is screaming at you over it then let it run off your back. Your ex-wife is obviously not doing any work to get past your mistake which is a shame because it will affect your daughter in the end. You were not an asshole in the situation just a worried dad.", "NTA Since it was an emergency. You were frazzled, worried about your daughter, and wanted to keep her in the loop as you should. Then you stayed to make sure your daughter was okay. Just because you cheated doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the right to be there for your daughter.", "NTA. Kids always first especially in these circumstances.", "NTA and after three years Mary needs to get over it or get therapy. Stop missing out on your daughters' activities because of your ex-wife. This is her problem and your daughter shouldn't be put in the middle. It isn't like you will be sitting with her. If she can't handle the idea of you being in a place big enough for sporting events, then she can stay home.", "NTA! You're the father and have every right to be at the hospital at the same time as your daughter and ex UNLESS there is a court order that states otherwise, like a restraining order. If these deals were not part of the custody agreement, your ex can go scratch. You may have cheated on her, but you two need to realize the screw up happened with your romantic relationship, not your parental obligations/relationships.", "NTA. Your ex needs help. You had a one night stand how many years ago. Shes acting like she was a battered wife. She not only needs to suck it up but she also needs to  grow up. This was a no win situation because if you followed the childish agreement and didn't contact her directly after you couldn't get in touch with her mother she would have lost it. Since you did contact her she is losing it. You did the right thing but if she wants to act like this if anything like this ever happens again ( I really hope it doesn't!) Contact her mother and if you get no response not your fault or your issue. I'm glad your child is okay.", "NTA there is no possible way you could have foreseen that your agreement still applied when you're just trying to let her know that her daughter is in fucking hospital.. And yeah it's not reasonable for her to expect you to leave your daughter in hospital either, if she really didn't want to see you she was free to leave herself, especially since she apparently didn't even want to know she was in there in the first place.\n\nShe does need to grow the fuck up and get over it.\n\nShe also needs to unblock you for these situations.", "NTA. This arrangement can't negate the need for certain realities. \n\nLike if Sally has a seizure or something Mary is going to need to know asap. So in cases like this the agreement is invalid and Mary needs to suck it up. By the same token if Sally is getting an ct scan for said seizure you aren't going to want to leave the hospital and Mary's uncomfortable with you pales in your fear for your child.", "NTA. You did the right thing by contacting jer to let her know your child had an injury that required a trip to the hospital. Technically if one of you needed to leave during that time, it was her, as it happened during your time with your daughter. I agree, your ex wife breeds to not only suck it up, she needs to grow up.", "NTA. These types of coparenting relationships do nothing but hurt the child, and to not want to have contact with you even when it comes to your child\u2019s health is an extreme. Y\u2019all don\u2019t need to be best friends, but you\u2019re right in that she needs to suck it up for your daughter.", "NTA. She needs to grow the hell up and stop acting like a child. Yeesh.", "NTA and (I hope there isn't but if there's a) next time I'd just leave a voice or text message for the ex-MIL.

I know I'm an asshole at this, I don't seek justification for what I did and I accepted all the consequences of my act. We've been divorced for 3 years. \n\nWe have a daughter, Sally (5F) who we have 50/50 custody after a lot of fighting in court as Mary wanted full custody. \n\nWe have some \"deals\":\n\n 1. I don't talk to her, just to her mother for everything.\n\n 2. I pick up Sally from her mother's house. \n\n3. Let each other know in advance when we are going to participate in any of Sally's sporting events or activities, as she doesn't want to be in my presence. I know it's not ideal for our daughter, but believe me it was the best way for both of them to be present in her life without seeing each other's faces.\n\n If I saw Sally twice after the custody agreement, that's a lot. I try to keep my distance and respect her limit, because I know I fucked up. \n\n3 weeks ago, there was an accident at my parent's home and Sally hit her head pretty hard.\n\n I tried calling Mary's mother several times, but she didn't answer, so I called her number from my parents' cell phone (she blocked me on mine) and despite her complaining, I just informed her what happened and told her to find me at the hospital.\n\n She took a while to arrive as she was in another city. \n\nAs soon as Mary arrived, I went outside to talk to her (Sally was not alone), she started to say that  didn't give me the freedom to call her and that I knew of our agreement and that she would like me to be away for  a few hours, because she doesn't feel comfortable with me and she wanted to be with Sally. \n\nI asked if she was serious and she confirmed it. I said that I know very well about our agreement and her limits, but I won't be absent from the hospital for a few hours when our daughter is in this situation. So yes, I'm going over our agreement and yes, I called her, because she's  her mother and she has a right to know something like that. So suck it up. \n\nShe complained a little but agreed when I asked to focus on Sally.\n\n Sally is much better now btw, she stayed in the hospital for a few days. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from my mother-in-law from Mary, reminding me of our agreement and how I don't respect him and her boundaries, because I stayed in the hospital even though she said she was uncomfortable with me there.\n\n AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Definitely needs to grow up", "nta and i hope she dont bar you if there is an emergency on her end due to comfort", "NTA.\n\nProbably should not have procreate with this woman but its too late now.\n\nKeep doing whats right for the kid.\n\nEven if there is a real reason to be \"uncomfortable\" you are in a public place with zero chance of being alone.", "Esh\n\n\nTo be honest this arrangement will cause long term damage to your daughter.\n\nSecond I cannot believe your wife could put her feelings  ahead of her daughters well being.\n\n\nFinally I think you both need to put your daughter first. This animosity is ridiculous and childish .\n\n\nCheating is bad however you still decided to bring a child into this world. Try therapy and mediation.  Maybe the court can madate it. \n\n\nAt the end of the day your parents first, both of you have problems.\n\n\nGlad your daughter is ok.", "Depends. Is this court ordered? Did you abuse her? Were you manipulative of her? Were you controlling? I'd think long and hard about all of that. She is treating you like an abusive ex... Not someone who cheated on her. Not saying cheating doesn't suck, but it seems like there is more from her perspective than cheating. But staying with your daughter in the hospital was 100% the right thing. Unless there was an order or protection or something...", "NAH\nYou're N T A because it was an emergency. \n\nShe's also  N T A for never wanting to be around you or speak to you ever again for any reason. \n\nIf my math is right you cheated on your wife who was probably still struggling with her body image after having a baby. You are lower than low and she's right not to want to be around you.", "NTA but your ex absolutely is. It\u2019s been 3 years and she needs to let this anger go. It\u2019s not healthy for her, for Sally or your co parent relationship.  It\u2019s not even court ordered so she\u2019s needs to grow up and stop being so selfish her feelings in an emergency with your kid don\u2019t fucking matter.", "Info: have you ever threatened or assaulted your ex wife? Her behaviour could be justified if she feels afraid of you. If she\u2019s just disgusted with you for having a one night stand she needs to adjust her expectations.

I\u2019m not saying she needs to like you but the fact you couldn\u2019t even contact her in an emergency is ridiculous, and it\u2019s ridiculous to expect that she will never see you again or that you will be ok with leaving your daughter for things like hospital stays.", "Yeah NTA. You did a shitty thing, but your ex needs to put her big girl panties on and grow tf up for the sake of her daughter. Y\u2019all are divorced already you just need to be cordial and co partner before this becomes a living nightmare for your daughter and she resents the both of you forever.", "A text to the MIL could have been a good option. But this isn't sustainable. YAAH, but NTA.", "INFO: Is this agreement court ordered?", "NTA. My sister\u2019s ex cheated on her multiple times, was emotionally abusive, and kidnapped their two oldest kids. She still sees him when she needs to for the sake of the kids (he\u2019s a better person now action wise). Your wife needs to get over herself and learn to put her child first.", "NTA. You cheated, you didn't murder her puppy. Mary has every right to not want anything to do with you, but it's not that simple when you have a child together. She doesn't have to be friends with you, but she really needs to figure out how to at least put her resentment aside in an emergency.", "NTA and honestly your ex wife need major help. If I was her and I found out that my daughter was hurt and went to hospital during my ex husband care but he didn\u2019t tell me? I would be so furious! But the fact that she mad at you because you called her during emergency? Only one word I can describe this is unhinge.", "NTA. How selfish is she that she\u2019d think of her own feelings over her child\u2019s, especially in an emergency situation?", "NTA. It is pretty much impossible for her to set a boundary of \"I will have no contact with the other parent of my child\" without it becoming detrimental to, and possible even neglectful of your daughter. She also does not get to enforce this boundary by demanding that you leave any place that she does not have a unique privilege to be in, i.e. anywhere other than her home, her workplace, and possibly her parent's home. As such, it is completely inappropriate for her to ask you to leave the hospital. If she genuinely never wants to have contact with you again, the only reasonable way to go about that is to give up Sally and let you have full custody. But if she wants Sally, she needs to figure out how to co-parent.", "NTA. What you did that lead to your divorce was shitty and she has every right to feel the way she feels, but you\u2019re right. She needs to suck it up and this has been going on way longer than it should\u2019ve been. Coparenting with someone who fucked you over sounds like it sucks, but you both just have to deal with it. You are grown ass adults who have a child together. Act like it.", "Wait. Instead of running up to her little girl\u2019s hospital room and being there for her she chose to have a fight with you about not calling her when your daughter is in the hospital?\n\nNTA.", "Honestly I can see why you cheated\u2026", "NTA. Your ex wife needs therapy before she damages your relationship with your child over your failed marriage. People divorce every day for worse reasons and still coparent effectively.", "NTA the cheating aside you\u2019re both her parents and she needs to grow up for her child. I get it, you hurt her and she hates you, no one is going to blame her for that but when it comes to that child she needs to be a parent first and sometimes she needs you both. What she\u2019s doing is extremely damaging to your daughter.", "She has a custody agreement with you, not a restraining order. It's been three years, she should seek therapy so she can co-parent efficiently. The fact she's stonewalling you shows she lacks emotional maturity and an inability to cope with the situation at hand.", "NTA. She can hate you all she wants but you're right that she needs to suck it up and be mature enough to co-parent with you in a civil manner for her daughter's sake. This arrangement she's demanding is untenable. There will be more emergencies like this, there will be school events where your daughter will want you both to attend and she'll resent her mother for not allowing it, and there will be life events like graduations and possibly a wedding where your daughter will want her parents. She can't keep this up forever because it's going to cause long lasting emotional trauma to your daughter and will tear apart their relationship as mother and daughter. Your ex needs therapy if she doesn't want her future to be alone because she'll have driven her daughter away.", "She needs to grow up. It's been 3 years and all thay she's putting on your daughter is ridiculous and shows she is highly immature. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut you might want to redress these boundaries, in a legal way. \n\nFor example, she wanted you to leave the hospital so she could be there alone with Mary\u2026after 3 years being divorced\u2026yes you hurt her but she needs to act like a grown up. \n\nBut the main reason address these boundaries, I can guarantee you won\u2019t be told of any future incidents where you daughter ends up at emergency until after\u2026like when it\u2019s your custody time.", "NTA. This is not how divorced parents act in an emergency situation. You thought about your daughter\u2019s welfare, your ex thought how to punish you more. I mean, you might be a great guy, but you can\u2019t be so great that she can\u2019t get over you. This is her punishment if you, and it seems to have become her go-to. This is not healthy for your daughter.", "Strong NTA. You did the right thing OP and I commend you for that even though it must have been difficult for you. Your ex is really sounding selfish. Keep up the good parenting", "NTA. That's your daughter. Ex is putting her anger ahead of her own child.", "Yeah. I'm going to NTA as a parent. Maybe I'm a bit of a hard arse but my opinion is that the moment you have a child, your emotional feelings go on the back burner\n\nYou put your differences aside and communicate so your daughter can understand what healthy adulting looks like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously you were TA, you know that, you can't go back and change time.  Mary is right to not like you as a person. But that's got nothing to do with parenting with you for the sake of your child.  It's called being a grown up. And short of abuse or PTSD,  I just feel that as parents we need to move passed our personal discomforts and anxieties for their sakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the longrun your attitude towards eachother can seriously influence your child as she grows up, and it can colour how she will treat her interpersonal relationships as a consequence. Dysfunction breeds dysfunction", "NTA. You fucked up in the past, but she needs to leave her feelings aside for her child\u2019s well-being.", "NTA. Your agreement sounds unreasonable. It is not healthy for your child to have parents who can't ever communicate with each other.", "NTA My heart breaks for your daughter. 5 years old and leaving two completely separate lives.", "NTA and it sounds like your ex needs to grow the hell up and put its big girl pants on. Kids come first always regardless of how we the parents feel about one another. So no OP you did the right thing in this situation", "You weren't thinking about your daughter's future needs while you were fucking your co-worker. You had a strict agreement. You broke it. YTA.", "ESH.\n\nFigure out a better arrangement. You're doing long term damage to your kid.", "NTA...see this is my question how are they going to handle the kids HS graduation, college graduation or military graduation, wedding, grandkids birthday party????all the life milestones this kid is going to want both her parents at??? Or is dad supposed to give up seeing all of them because he f-up????", "With the way the ex is acting, I find myself questioning if they'd even still be married had OP not cheated. To be this level of a miserable person you had to be miserable before the gasoline was thrown on the fire.", "Exactly.", "Perfectly stated. My mom wasn't exactly happy with my dad's infidelity either, but she learned to be civil towards him for my sake. I (46f) can still remember going back and for as a little girl and I was absolutely clueless about any animosity between my parents. Unfortunately my mom did end up telling me when I was a young teenager and fighting with her. I must have gotten under her skin by saying I wanted to live with my dad one too many times bc the woman absolutely exploded. I found out many things about dad that I had absolutely no business knowing at that age, but that's another story. That said, it may be a glimpse of what's to come given OP's situation. OP wasn't being unreasonable, the rules are unreasonable for two people co-parenting a child.", "Far from co-parenting", "Yes as a child of divorce created by cheating there's going to be graduation marriage & the birth and birthdays of her future children eventually she'll need to get over it.", "I 100% Agree NTA!!  \n\nYes you were an AH to have cheated on your wife, however you have accepted all the consequences of your actions. Your ex-wife however is choosing to nurse a grudge to the detriment of her child and that is just wrong! If she cares more about her injured feelings then she does about your child during an emergency situation then she needs very serious therapy. I sincerely hope she gets it.", "Sorry, I put it on google translator because I don't know how to write English very well, so it may have come out incoherent.

I suspect we are not getting a whole/unbiased story of the end of their relationship and how the agreement came to be.", "They have a child. Cheating is awful and OP sucks a lot but his ex also sucks because she is putting her feelings before her child. \n\nAnd what happens in the future? Does Sally only get one parent at graduation? At her wedding?", "Wouldn\u2019t she have tried to at least get a protection order against him?\n\nUsually that\u2019s enough to at least make the judge consider more custody to the mother.", "\u201cIt was the best way for both of THEM to be present in her life without seeing each other\u2019s faces.\u201d  \u201creminding me of our agreement and how I don\u2019t respect him and her boundaries\u201d ?

But according to you, that strict agreement is far more important than the potential of Mary finding out after the fact Sally died because he couldn\u2019t get hold of Mary\u2019s mother.", "Yeah if this ain't the dumbest take I have ever seen. Yes, OP cheated and mary is allowed to still feel hurt from that while wanting the conditions of the rules to be met but this was a fucking emergency. And I dont know about anyone else but I would rather hear that my daughter's in the hospital from the mouth of my cheating ex than having to wait to be called from my mother to hear that shes in the hospital. Because if OP had to continue to try her mother's phone and gets no answer, and something worse had happened to Sally because he's not allowed to call her, she would be beside herself with guilt. And she cant blame op because he was following the rules and it's not his fault her mother didnt answer.", "Him cheating on his wife has nothing to do with his commitment to do right by his child. It is in the child\u2019s best interest to have both parents present at the hospital not to mention with a 50/50 custody plan it\u2019s most likely joint decision making. Mom needs to stop being a bigger ex wife and put her kid first", "No one thinks about their kids when they cheat. Sometimes things aren't about kids. And no I've never cheated.  Adults have complex relationships and kids don't factor in when cheating. (And often is a sign of an unhealthy marriage, although not always). Often it's a straw that broke the camels back.

You have to love the child more than you hate the other parent.", "My best friend's dad was such a cheater that she went absolutely scorched earth with her baby daddy. I understood because there's some of there but she ended up looking extremely uncooperative to the custody judge and it really bit her in the ass in the end", "It absolutely could be because he cheated.\nSome people get hella pissed at being cheated on.", "Not necessarily.

The system, and society are broken.", "Hahaha ohh if only the courts were that consistent...", "I didn't write that. I don't agree with their arrangement. I also wouldn't want go be around my ex who cheated. They had an infant when it happened. The fact that they don't have a plan if the parents couldn't be reached by phone is insane.
