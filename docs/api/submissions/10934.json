I saw the guy getting in his van as I was walking by and I called him out, and he did the whole \u201cI just had to run into wherever\u201d thing and it\u2019s like.. ok, and now I\u2019m 10 minutes late for work. And have to come move my car in two hours. Cool.", "NTA\nI'm assuming that you live with your parents which gives you the right to call a tow truck when a car takes the rented spot. The visitor's spaces must not be as conveniently located as your mom's space or it be used so frequently by visitors. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nAlso, the fact that he watched your mom park and FOLLOWED her to yell at her is harassment. Please take note of which house HE came from in case he foolishly tries to damage her car.", "NTA. Not even 1 minute.", "NTA. I would have done the same thing. I\u2019ve lived in a place like that and it\u2019s frustrating when someone takes the spot you pay for; often it\u2019s very hard to find alternative parking and if you\u2019re trying to carry groceries in, it sucks. This guy is the asshole, especially if he stalked your mom and came to your house afterward. \u2018I\u2019ll only be five minutes\u2019 is a bullshit, entitled response that says he doesn\u2019t think he should have to follow the rules like everyone else.", "Nta.  It is ur moms spot not his.  Maybe the tow bill will make him learn", "NTA. Marked spaces for visitors and he parks in a designated spot? It's on him.", "Info: does she literally own the parking spot? Like pays for it? If so, NTA. if not, YTA. Also- did he know that your mom \u201cowned\u201d the parking space? Maybe he had no idea and was in a rush or something. \n\n Calling a tow truck was a bit overkill tho imo. You said yourself it had only been 3-4 minutes. If it was longer I\u2019d understand that more though. But how was he supposed to know that parking spot was already being used? He probably had no idea.", "INFO: What kind of car was it?", "I don't get why they think their claims that it was a 15 min window would make it any better.\n\nI mean if the carpark owner shows up what is she supposed to do, just park in the middle of the road and read a book while she waits?", "Agree, NTA.  I would have called the tow truck too and have in the past.  I was moving and had street signs out as well as paid to be granted full access to the street.  Some A decided to leave a ride share vehicle where we needed a moving truck to be.  So I called and got it towed.  The ride share company wasn't surprised and was actually happy to tow it", "There\u2019s more to this story than we are being told.  OP *just happened* to witness this and called a tow truck immediately?  Then the driver *somehow* knew which door to knock on?\n\nThis smells personal.", "Why did he sit and watch the guy without saying anything? If he saw him pull in, is it that hard to ask him to move? If the guy was receptive he would move the cat. If he was a jerk about it, the tow truck could have been called 5 minutes sooner. Its a totally passive aggressive move.", "This was my thought. I kind of feel like there could have been some preventative measures\n If yout sitting thier watching him park, why not ask him in the moment.", "Usually it takes time for tow trucks to come, his parents are gonna park in the spot so it\u2019s best to deal with the issue as early as possible by calling the tow truck company. Also it\u2019s effort to knock on a bunch of doors to find the owner of the car, it\u2019s less effort to call a towing company. The guy shouldn\u2019t cost OP any effort so low effort option it is", "Places like this advertise the exact towing company that they have a contract with. There are likely multiple signs saying who to call if you believe your car has been towed or if you need to tow. Having a company on \u201cspeed dial\u201d isn\u2019t required. \n\nSource: I\u2019ve lived in multiple places with assigned, paid parking spots. \n\nAlso- I didn\u2019t get the feeling OP tows everyone. He told us about one incident. I can\u2019t extrapolate that to say he tows everyone.", "These days, confrontations with strangers can be dangerous.", "Tow truck drivers don't just tow cars because someone called. It was very clearly marked like how every other apartment/condo does assigned parking.  That's how the dude knew whose house to confront.\n\nAlso every person who gets caught parking illegally always say \"I was only gonna be for a few minutes\"", "If thats true he sounds like s complete psycho.\n\nThere were other spots available, did he just want confrontation.", "Often reserved spots in a condo complex are painted with the house number they belong to, I suspect that was the case here.", "Not that weird. Sitting at desk near a window, hear a car parking, think it's the parents and look through window, it's some guy. People sometimes stop in weird places to look at maps or when something happens, so he kept looking but the driver just left.", "My parents' condo had the spots labeled with their condo number.", "Or made up", "So 59 seconds?", "I think OP wanted the guy to get in trouble tbh..otherwise he'd have waited more than a few minutes", "Yeah because the kind of douchebags that purposely take someone else's spot then goes to confront the person after is totally going to be rational and just move it for you becuase you asked.", "Because confronting strangers can turn into a horror scene real fast? Especially with those who make it their pride to ignore rules? Sure, it could have been a mistake, but why risk it when there are official ways to handle such situation?", "His line of thinking? Which is \"people should act like adults and talk to eachother\"? The maddness!", "People would rather scream \"MINE\" and escalate the situation than just have a normal human interaction and it's sad.", "Did he explain that to the guy? Of course not. Your line of thinking is..... selfish.", "Stealing? Lol no. If it happened consta try then that's one thing, but that's not the case here. You know what I did when people parked in my spot? I went and told the personally to move, becuase I'm an adult and know how to use my words.\n\nCalling a tow truck within 5 minutes is nuts and just being an asshole for no reason.", "\"I was tired and wanted to sit down, so I sat on a park bench. After a few minutes, the cops showed up and arrested me. They said the bench was actually private property of a business adjacent to the park and that I was trespassing. There were no signs to indicate that I couldn't use this bench, and no fence to keep people out. How was I to know?\"", "An unused concrete square is not the same as entering someone's home and you know it.", "This sub is wild. Comparing breaking and entering to parking in a reserved parking space? Come on.", "it's a parking space and it was for about 10 grow up sharing is a good thing, not being an ass to your neighbors is a good thing, being kind and considerate is a good thing, having compassion is a good thing. \n\nbeing selfish is a bad thing, intentionally making someone else life harder because you can is a bad thing.\n\nHelp who you can and those you can't help do your very best not to hurt. \n\nThat's what I'm saying, so sorry so many think being kind is bad.", "I think that's 100% okay.", "Please clarify: is there a sign that says that your mom's spot is reserved and others can't park there? Is her spot labeled in any way?", "I agree you should be careful poking people but why should we just be a doormat because \u201csomeone MIGHT be crazy\u201d if I\u2019m paying to use something am I fuck going to let people walk all over me and use it unless having permission from me, you don\u2019t get to be an asshole and then get angry just to get out of it", "it must be so frustrating for OP\u2019s mom that OP is the only person in the family who is allowed to call a tow truck!", "No it doesn't cost them. They're still paying the same money regardless of whether the spot is in use when they're away.\n\nPeople would rather scream \"MINE\" than just have a regular interaction like human beings", "It costs them? Ok how much does it cost them if someone parked in their spot once when they weren't using it for 15 minutes? Show yout math on this one.", "Sounds like someone wanted to discuss what had happened and wanted to figure out who they should talk to.", "Me, too. My townhome doesn't have a garage but *clearly* labeled spaces. I have brand new neighbors next door (been here less than 2 months). Their guests are always parking in my second spot. Their dad, the actual owner, is one of the worst offenders. They moved here from an apartment community, probably with no assigned parking. Last night, a car was in my second place (we all have 2 designated locations) from 6 pm until well after midnight. I don't want to cause bad feelings between us, but there's plenty of guest parking really close. Any ideas on how to enlighten them to \"correct parking etiquette\" and word it so it doesn't come across rudely? I rarely see them.", "The guy parked there and left. how is he supposed to find him? or is he going to have a conversation with the parked car and politely ask it to move.", "I wouldn't say selfish. Probably comes from a fear of social interactions, imo. People are truely afraid of just interacting with a person to move their car so instead they want to hide and call someone else to deal with it.", "You sure there were no signs?", "Do you go an hang around in a stranger's yard just because it's an unused concrete square?", "It makes a lot more sense when you understand that most people on this sub aren't judging if someone is the asshole so much as they are judging without or not the petty BS the person does is justifiable or not.", "They live there, it's their families spot. I've lived in a downtown complex before and I paid good money for my parking so it's my space. Not some randoms to use as they want to come and go. It's like saying you'd park in a handicap spot that someone else needs but it's ok cause you'd only be \"10 mins\"", "Yea. As someone who would do this, it's not normal. You're a little off your rocker if you wait for someone to come home and watch them walk to where they live.", "The only people he needs to talk to are the tow company.", "I\u2019ve left parking rules on cars. Granted I did it to ALL the cars because I was on the board and we were advertising the rules to everyone (as we do every year). \n\nMy neighborhood has had tow trucks & police called for all sorts of situations and usually the offenders play ignorance. Thus, we heavily educate. \n\nEdited.", "In the United States tow companies are allowed to be incredibly predatory.", "Someone asked and OP dodged the question, saying only that the visitor stalls are marked. I've asked OP to clarify, we'll see if they do.\n\nBut without knowing more, it very much seems like this person could have just made a mistake, and OP didn't feel like being a human being and going to talk to them, or cut them any slack.", "That sounds right. My condo is awful for marking spots. There's visitor parking...somewhere. Goodluck figuring out which spots those are though.", "Exactly. And if there aren't signs to let you know that spots are reserved, you don't know to even go looking for the visitor ones in the first place."]}
