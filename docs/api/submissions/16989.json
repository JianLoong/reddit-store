Or were these mistakes like spelling 'plaintif' with one 'f' instead of two?\n\nIf it's the latter YTA; lawyers aren't perfect, nobody is, and it's really shitty for you to call their professionalism into question over inconsequential spelling mistakes. *Everybody* makes mistakes, even lawyers (or, more likely, the paralegal who this was dictated to). Requesting they be corrected in itself is fine, it's your unnecessarily rude and insulting demeanor that's at issue.\n\nIf it's the former ESH, it *is* unprofessional for a lawyer to send you a legal document without ensuring that it legally says what it is intended to and merits calling out, but there's really no reason for you to be rude to them about it.\n\nSo which is it, linguistic errors or legal errors?", "NTA for pointing out numerous spelling mistakes and asking for them to be fixed, but sounds like you were pretty rude about it.

Being polite but firm is probably the best approach because depending on how they respond, how they represent you as a whole starts at the very beginning.

But I think the attorney missed his age or something because what it said extended child support for a full year after graduation. \n\nI called my lawyer and told her what I\u2019d found. She reminded me that when her office drafted orders, they always had me read it first because obviously I was more familiar with the details, like the ages of the kids.
