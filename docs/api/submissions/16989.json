In the 80s, the rock band Van Halen had a  rider in their touring contract that required the band be provided with a large bowl of M&Ms in their dressing room, but another section of the contract included a proviso that prohibited brown M&M's candies anywhere in the backstage area.\n\nFailure to comply would allow the band to cancel the concert at the promoter's expense. This rider was often seen as a display of rock star arrogance, but the real reason behind it was to ensure the safety of the band, crew, and fans. Van Halen's elaborate stage production featured pyrotechnics and other dangerous elements which required precise building specifications. The \"no brown M&M's\" clause served as a way to test whether the promoter had carefully read and complied with the rest of the contract.\n\nIf brown M&M's were found, it was a warning sign that other critical details may have also been overlooked. The band took their safety seriously and thoroughly rechecked the stage setup every time a brown M&M was found.
