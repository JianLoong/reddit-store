In fact, I think you're being a very loving brother, whilst he is being the greedy one.\n\nLook, if your mother had wanted him to have the house/inheritance entirely to himself, and thought that your relative circumstances warranted that, SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SOLELY TO HIM. She had the opportunity to do that, and she did not. She wanted you to have your half, and that's really the most important thing. This was HER property, and she wanted her sons each to have a share of it.\n\nYour offers to him are not only reasonable but smart and generous. The only reason he could possibly want you to give up the house is to sell it. If he wants to live in it . . . well, you've offered him that option, and it doesn't seem like he could afford the upkeep any more if the house belonged entirely to him than if he were living in it rent-free. There's really no difference between the two financially. Which means that the only reason he wants it is to sell it - which you have also offered as a possibility - but that he wants the entire sale price to himself. Again, this makes HIM the greedy one. Half the sale price of that house would be more than enough for him to buy a nice small house for himself and his family. Similarly, if you rented it out, it would give him a nice income. \n\nHe's the AH here, unreasonable and selfish.

The audacity.", "NTA. My BIL tried this nonsense with his parents house because his siblings \u201calready had their own houses and it was his home\u201d. Not their fault that he made poor financial and lifestyle decisions, and lived with his parents all his life without paying rent.", "He's asking you to give him $750? That's not going to happen. NTA. He has 4 very good and viable options and he needs to pick one.", "Holy crap. NTA. Amongst other options, you offered that he could live in the house and just pay taxes and upkeep. That\u2019s freaking awesome. Regardless of your financial position, giving up $750k is not inconsequential.", "NTA. Losing a parents can bring out the worst in people.", "Your brother is insane and entitled. You never know what life may throw at you and that money is a safety net.", "NTA. It sounds like he doesn't appreciate the value of a dollar to expect you to give away three quarters of a million. The offer for him to live there for free is extremely generous. He should have jumped at it. He sounds like a user.", "NRA and he\u2019s apparently a huge one for suggesting you do this and trying to guilt you into it.", "NTA. You offered several reasonable alternatives. You are not obligated to give up your share of inheritance just because you have been successful. And I say this as someone who is more in your brothers shoes.", "NTA. End of. He's being the selfish one. You earned what you have.\nInheritance isn't something you earn, it's something you get given. Fair would be to sell, split and he buy his own house. One for around half a mil with the rest paying for bills untill he gets a decent job. Or even smaller house.", "NTA You gave him four very reasonable options. He is acting entitled.", "Having him live there and only pay taxes and do maintenance is a BAD idea.  You can expect the bare minimum of maintenance to be done, zero updates, and the taxes to be paid late.  This means at a point in the future the house will be worth less when it\u2019s sold, as it will be dated, and there may be repairs required by the lender.   In addition, you will miss out on potential investment income between today and the future sale date.   Further, depending upon how the title is issued, if he passes, his spouse may inherit his portion, leaving you owning a house with your in-law.  Talk to a lawyer and make a better decision.\n\nExactly this terrible decision cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $500k.", "The best solution for your brother is to agree to rent.oit the house that provides supplemental income that he can use to purchase his own home.", "NTA. As many others have said, you guys should sell it. He can absolutely buy most of a wonderful house with 750k. He is just trying to get as much out of it as possible.", "Nta", "Nta", "NTA\u2026you gave him the best shot of living there, pay the taxes and utilities. If he can\u2019t afford the taxes, then he doesn\u2019t deserve to have full ownership.\n\nIf that\u2019s the route you\u2019re planning to take, discuss with a lawyer to protect yourself and the house. Maintenance can be a money pit sometimes", "NTA", "Not important to the judgment, but I read the opening as \"My mother (58) recently passed away and my brother (48)\"\n\nThe sheer horror and dread that I felt because I've watched some YouTube video called something like \"youngest mothers in history\" so I knew it could sadly be true is a feeling I never wish to feel again", "NTA. \n\nYour family is poor. \n\nBut have a million dollar house?\n\nYour brother wants your inheritance.\n\nhe can\u2019t afford a house with 750k?\n\nI\u2019m seeing some holes in this story.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour options are all reasonable.  If your mother had wanted him to be the sole beneficiary she'd have specified it in the will.  \n\nWould he even be able to afford to live there if you did what he's asking you to do?  Do you think he might want you to hand it over to him legally then sell it so he can keep the \u00a31.5 million for himself?", "NTA You have given him, 4 options to pick from.  If he can't afford a home, how is he going to take care of this home, even if you gave it to him?", "YTA\n\nI question OP's motives exactly because he acts like being generous toward his brother would be detrimental to himself. Why does he think it would hurt himself to give any more than he has to? He acts like being able to give to people he loves is a punishment for having success in life. What a fucking bizarre mentality. I would say it's a benefit of success. Also, I'm sure if he thought about it more, he'd realize that people who work minimum wage jobs still work just as hard as anyone else, they just don't get to have savings, healthy food, flexible time to see their families, etc. as a result of their work.\n\nI think OP is onto something by asking himself if he is being greedy. Our nagging feelings tell us something, and it's worth trying to listen.\n\nWhat would OP lose by giving up his half? A house he doesn't want to live in? Money he never needed anyway? If he can sit on his deathbed content that he got what was \"owed\" to him even though it meant the people he loved never got to live their most basic dreams, yeah he lived a greedy life.", "It sounds like there is no way he would be able to pay taxes on a 1.5m home. Need to sell and buy something reasonable.", "OP says his parents were poor but have a 1.5mill house. That means he lives in an area where housing values really shot up in the last 30 years. I live in an area like that - you cannot buy a shitty rundown bungalow for 750k. Those cost 1.5mill.", "NTA, why didn't he choose the last option of living there free just paying taxes and maintenance? Who does he think would be responsible for paying those even if OP gave up his share of the inheritance?", "They seem to live in the San Francisco Bay area, so housing there is going to lean towards super expensive. 1.5 million is about the going middle rate. \n\nHonestly, the tax on that home is going to be astronomical. It's far better to get a house further out from the city, as it would be cheaper.", "Had a friend's brother pull this when talking about their sister. He'd whine about how the sister had a nice car, expensive jewelry, etc. Yeah, bro, she has all that because she worked her butt off at two jobs.", "You have 750,000 in inheritance. You can move to a cheaper locale.", "So? 750K would be an enormous down payment. He\u2019d pay off any lingering mortgage quite easily.", "Time to move somewhere else then. That's an easy choice. Why fight that hard to have so little when he could probably move somewhere way way way cheaper?", "Surely he also has some money to contribute from his own savings", "Moving is pretty easy. Especially when you have a new $750,000.", "They don\u2019t need to live in the same area and he actually shouldn\u2019t because he will have a hard time with the cost of living. He should accept one of his brother\u2019s offers. Either way, he\u2019s not entitled to the whole inheritance and if he can\u2019t find something for $750,000 in an area he can afford than he\u2019s living beyond his means.", "Yes, was he expecting OP to still keep paying for those even if OP gave him the house?", "Depends where they live but almost everywhere on the west coast $750000 will get you a nice house except the major metropolitan areas but if he doesn\u2019t work a job within an industry that requires he lives there her could easily move outside those areas and still work a min wage job.", "Oh, looks like the median has dropped to \"just\" about 1 million. Same premise applies though. If they can't afford to get a house with that, then they can't afford the taxes and upkeep.", "There are plenty of places in the Bay area where you can get a house for $750k or at least put down a huge down payment . Not everyone lives in Atherton or The City.", "I think they're in the Bay", "i just wanna know if its even viable for them to be called options otherwise dudes an asshole he know his brother cant get money to buy him out or pay the taxes , i agree could he even afford the taxes if op said sure have the house ? Thats why im asking op hasnt responded to anyone so who cares threads dead , and giving someone whos not finically literate a large sum of money with out help is setting them up for failure i thought op loved his brother and would want to help him succeed that since he said \" i love my brother\" all these people saying basically fuck him hes an adult like damn bro thats his family not some random person but expecting nuance from this sub is unreasonable", "Yeah, why can't he use the 750k to pay off a large chunk of a home, if homes in that area are so expensive he can't buy something for that amount, and get a mortgage for the rest?\n\nOr take OP's idea of renting it out and splitting the profit in order to pay off half of his rent which would make life a lot easier? Unless you're very wealthy, 750k is at least a huge help in your finances, even if it won't buy you a whole house.", "Yeah, poor people should just move away from their job and social support system.", "[deleted]", "Its not that easy. It's hard as hell to do and you often have to have a really good support system wherever you're going.", "oh man, why didn't op's brother think of this! it's so simple! /s", "Yeah but what I'm saying is, if he took his half and invested in a LCOL area like Louisiana or Mississippi, he'd have his house paid for -so no house payment- and he'd have several investment properties. He could easily live off the proceeds of those and never work again a day in his life!  He wouldn't even have to manage them himself, he'd have enough income to hire someone. This is the sensible thing to do, I think.", "I live in Central Louisiana, 1800 sf 4bd/2ba, right now runs about 135k, that's right in town.  Go out a little way, price drops, a LOT! I've seen good houses for as little as 60k, out in the country.\n\nAlso we have some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet here, the absolute best food, and great weather. 'Course the mosquitoes will carry off small children and pets in the summer but that's a Minor Setback! \nJK. Mostly.", "He is not being an asshole for being unwilling to walk away from $750k. And his comments about his finances are mostly in relation to his brother, his brother sees him as more stable etc and the fact that his home is paid off (which doesn't mean he is a millionaire, he could have just prioritized home ownership, paying off his mortgage). \n\nLocation really does matter because factors like housing markets and property taxes vary so much. \n\nI could buy a good home and have some leftover for $750k and as I said, property taxes on a million house would be less than rent, so in my area most of the options would be available (buying the OP out night not be as mortgage rules are very strict).", "With $750k he\u2019ll no longer be poor. That\u2019s change your life money. There\u2019s lots of decent areas he could live and keep $350K-$400K of that in the bank. With a decent house paid in full.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a safety net. Which could allow the brother time to retrain, buy into a business, start a business or simply continue to work a lower paying job and supplement his wages with investment income.", "If they can't afford to live where they live, yeah, they should. Unless OP's brother works in some niche field that only has jobs in his HCOL area, yeah, he should move. Living in a nice house in an area you can afford is better than paying $1.5mil for a shack and barely being able to afford it.", "If his job is minimum wage, why wouldn't he.", "Move away from their job that doesn\u2019t pay them enough to live? Sure.", "Yes, they should. Just like they have for generations.", "So instead OP should give up their half of the inheritance?  You think that\u2019s fair?", "Let's not introduce even more problems to speculate on without more information. He might not even live in that area as it is. If he can't buy a house with 750k then it's highly likely that he's priced out of that area entirely if he's been earning minimum wage for the last 30 or so years.", "There are plenty of places where you can still get a new 3-4 bedroom for under $350k while also not having to live in Texas.", "But then you are in Texas.", "If you don't have money to support yourself. OP's brother has $750,000. That's enough to buy a house and have money leftover in like 40 states. I can buy a house in Florida for $300k no problem.", "No, no you don't. Source, have moved all across the country as a kid, as a young adult and as a parent with kids.", "Yeah no you don\u2019t.", "lmk if op responds otherwise who cares threads dead he wont answer any questions", "After reading this comment, I started thinking why wouldn't he do that- and maybe I'm thinking the worst of OP's brother here, but now I'm wondering if he's trying to get them to give up their share so he can then sell it and get the full 1.5 million for it. \n\nI mean, OP offered to let him live in the house and basically treat it as thought it were solely his, as long as he agrees to be responsible for it as though it were solely his, but he doesn't want that without getting full ownership; maybe he's just thinking that he doesn't want to be responsible for maintaining the house if he doesn't get the full benefit of owning it and I'm just being sceptical, but it does seem like a fair deal to me.", "That still leaves the social support system, which is important for poor people. Especially if it's a favour economy one.", "You should read the words I wrote instead of imagining your own so that you can get offended about them.", "He definitely would have enough, the problem is whether he wants to move to a different state and leave friends.and other support systems. He definitely should at least try for a highee paying job.", "I'm sorry but 750k is not poor in the least here. They can move to a different part of the country and live quite comfortably off that.", "If he doesn't want to move to a different state and leave friends and other support systems, he can pay upkeep and taxes. That's about as sweetheart of a deal as you'll get on a 1.5 million dollar home. Exclusive use, exclusive costs.", "nether of us know anything with out op replying and clarifying , im asking for info and op wont respond so who cares", "YES! Thank you! This was my thinking too!"]}
