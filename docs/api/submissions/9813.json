In fact, I think you're being a very loving brother, whilst he is being the greedy one.\n\nLook, if your mother had wanted him to have the house/inheritance entirely to himself, and thought that your relative circumstances warranted that, SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SOLELY TO HIM. She had the opportunity to do that, and she did not. She wanted you to have your half, and that's really the most important thing. This was HER property, and she wanted her sons each to have a share of it.\n\nYour offers to him are not only reasonable but smart and generous. The only reason he could possibly want you to give up the house is to sell it. If he wants to live in it . . . well, you've offered him that option, and it doesn't seem like he could afford the upkeep any more if the house belonged entirely to him than if he were living in it rent-free. There's really no difference between the two financially. Which means that the only reason he wants it is to sell it - which you have also offered as a possibility - but that he wants the entire sale price to himself. Again, this makes HIM the greedy one. Half the sale price of that house would be more than enough for him to buy a nice small house for himself and his family. Similarly, if you rented it out, it would give him a nice income. \n\nHe's the AH here, unreasonable and selfish.

On a house worth $1.5 million, that's $45,000 at least.

If he's earning anything less than that, then he may still be able to keep the house, but he won't be able to afford the upkeep and/or taxes.\n  \nIf that happens, he will likely end up selling it for a ridiculously low cost.
