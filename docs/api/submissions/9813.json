You gave him a lot of options.  I've never been a person who's had much, but I hate people who think their better off siblings should just give them what they want because they are rich.  In fact, both of my siblings are way better off than I, but I wouldn't dream of asking them for anything, and manage fine on my own.", "**NTA**\n\nNot at all. In fact, I think you're being a very loving brother, whilst he is being the greedy one.\n\nLook, if your mother had wanted him to have the house/inheritance entirely to himself, and thought that your relative circumstances warranted that, SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SOLELY TO HIM. She had the opportunity to do that, and she did not. She wanted you to have your half, and that's really the most important thing. This was HER property, and she wanted her sons each to have a share of it.\n\nYour offers to him are not only reasonable but smart and generous. The only reason he could possibly want you to give up the house is to sell it. If he wants to live in it . . . well, you've offered him that option, and it doesn't seem like he could afford the upkeep any more if the house belonged entirely to him than if he were living in it rent-free. There's really no difference between the two financially. Which means that the only reason he wants it is to sell it - which you have also offered as a possibility - but that he wants the entire sale price to himself. Again, this makes HIM the greedy one. Half the sale price of that house would be more than enough for him to buy a nice small house for himself and his family. Similarly, if you rented it out, it would give him a nice income. \n\nHe's the AH here, unreasonable and selfish. You are being very fair, and you deserve the inheritance that your mother chose to give you. NTA.", "NTA.  His inheritance should be enough for a down payment on a house.  He could use the profit from selling the home or the rent money to pay.  I believe it isn't the issue of not being able to afford a home with the inheritance, but that it wouldn't be as grand of a home as your late mother's.  All the solutions you provided him are perfectly reasonable.", "NTA\n\nHe wants you to sign it over so he can sell it and get all of the money.", "NTA - don\u2019t even pay your brother any mind. He\u2019s only saying this to take advantage of you. Don\u2019t punish yourself for your success, he should be happy with any size of a windfall, he\u2019s being awfully entitled.

Not on you that he can\u2019t afford to outright own a house himself.", "NTA", "NTA - he doesn't deserve your portion of the inheritance just because you are better off than him.

Your mother through her will decided to treat you and your brother equally.\n\nYou need to realize that the inheritance is going to change your relationship with your brother because he feels that it is unfair.  He is never going to willingly agree to anything less than him getting the whole house for free.\n\nI would suggest that you sell the house and split the proceeds.  Any other solution is going to leave you tied to your brother in some way and given that he thinks it\u2019s unfair, he will find ways to cause you angst.\n\nFYI - I went through this with my own brother when our parents passed.  I made the mistake of trying to be nice and and provide options, but my brother was just angry that he didn\u2019t get everything, that he had to split my dad\u2019s estate equally with his sisters.  It was ugly\u2026 but in all honesty, not surprising because he had the same attitudes growing up.  I was in your shoes, I was doing well from making good choices, and he was divorced and broke from making terrible choices (he cheated).\n\nSo, the sooner you split the estate and you and your brother go your own ways with your own shares, the better off it will be for the both of you.", "NTA.

It very common for people to get large sums of money or win lottery's then end up being broke again.\n\nbut like i said we dont know anything op didnt give a lot of information other than his brother is stupid and a low income earner.
