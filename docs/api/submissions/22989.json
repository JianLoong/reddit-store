Our birthday is in April and we started planning it in Jan/Feb and we told our friends about it so they could start getting their costumes ready. Our LDR boyfriends were coming to visit so we also asked them to dress like princes. Our parents, brother, family friends and boyfriends got their outfits which mind you was a bit of a task because a lot of the guys did not want to dress up but did anyways because it's our birthday.\r  \n\r  \nSo as it goes on, we sent texts frequently until the date of our birthday reminding them it was a princess/prince dress up party and even sending them links to dresses and shirts that they might like and that would fit the theme. We even went as far as offering to buy outfits for those who reached out and said they wouldn't be able to dress up due to financial reasons. Although they never reached back out to confirm.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, fast forward to the day of the party, everyone else shows up in their outfits and its all fun and nostalgic and then all the friends start showing up and every. single. one. of them were in jeans and a casual top. Not even nice dresses or any kind of clothes that could fit the theme slightly. Basic tee and jeans. My sister and I shared a look and we both knew we were upset. We didn't say anything so that we could avoid an awkward night. My sister and I talked about it after the party and how it hurt our feelings and showed what kind of friends they were.\r  \n\r  \nLater that week someone made plans in that group to go out to dinner. They picked a place that's attire was dress however you want. Myself, my boyfriend, my sister and her boyfriend all decided to dress casual because we had a long day out and didn't feel like dressing up nice. We got to the place and they were all dressed very nice. Dresses, fancy shirts and all that. Again my sister and I shared a look and when we got to the table, one of them said \"you guys couldn't have made yourself cuter for photos?\" followed by laughs and \"yeahs\" from the rest of the group. I got up, said \"really? like you did for our party?\" and I left and waited by the car. My boyfriend and my sister and her boyfriend came after me and we all just went home. We got a bunch of texts from our group saying we were being childish and petty. I told them I didn't want to talk to them. They've tried apologizing and reaching out multiple times but I've never been close with them anyways and would rather not continue the friendship. Am I being dramatic?

I want to go to a princess party.", "You\u2019re not even close with any of these people? Why even invite them to your party", "NTA. OP, drop these friends. They sound extremely toxic. You're better off without them.", "Dramatic yes. But nta. You have the right to associate yourself whoever you want.", "NTA they sound like tools. Hope you and your sister find better friends who actually care about you two.", "I get it. Some people do not have money and they're very uncomfortable taking money from someone else. When I was younger I did, and it was later used against me. That's understandable. However, they should have made some effort to either a. inform you they weren't able to get a costume and why (Sorry, B, I got bills so I can't pay out for a princess costume) b. at least attempt to wear something \"nice\" to the party to show they were trying. Or c. cry off and not go at all. I know some people would have found a \"Princess\" party a bit childish. And that's okay. They should have made a reasonable excuse in that case and simply not gone. To each their own. I have to admit, I'm the latter. I have never enjoyed \"Princess\" type stuff even as a little girl. I wouldn't have gone to your party, but I would have been Nice about it and not insulted Your taste. Or, better, I'd have shown up dressed like Maleficent, who is, IMO, very much a badass Princess. \n\nIf you got upset with that, I'd have told you you were in the wrong. \n\nBut then you go to another event and those same people berate You for doing the same thing they did but even less insulting? When the place was \"dress in whatever your like\" ? What? \n\nNTA. \n\nYour \"friends\" do not respect you and in some ways, look down on you. And that is not something a \"friend\" does. I don't always have the same taste, identity, style or hobbies as some of my friends, but I do not look down on them for being who they are. These people look down on you. You're not being dramatic; you're setting clear boundaries and letting them know you will not be disrespected. Good for you.", "NTA \n\nWho needs this drama?

Also, have you not been taught that someone showing up is a gift in itself? Apparently not to you. It's ok that you don't want these friends because I don't think they're losing any sleep over it.\n\nEdited: and having to ask would make everyone feel like they're poor and that would make them feel badly. If you were so strict, you should have made it clear that people who did not dress up would be refused entry. Just find it really sad that you care more about your party and how it looked than the idea of being surrounded by people who cared enough about you to show up at all", "You\u2019ll survive so YTA", "YTA. Kind of entitled", "NTA with friends like this you don't need enemy.", "ESH. Your friends thought your princess party was stupid, you paid them back at the restaurant, now go your separate ways. Princess parties Jesus Christ.", "This.  They made a point to get all dressed up for the restaurant to show they COULD, and to let you know they purposely chose to come to your party as slobs, probably to embarrass you.  Then didn't tell you the restaurant was dress up, to embarrass you AGAIN.\n\nWith friends like this, you already have enemies.", "Omg, let's please have a princess party together.", "I live in a small country and went to a very small k-12 school, basically growing up with them. They're the only friends I have here and my sister is quite fond of them but ever since middle-highschool i have grown apart from them.", "Thank you so much for your input. I can definitely understand that someone didn't want to partake in dressing up but as you mentioned could have easily said they did not want to but up until date of party they seemed fully into it. \n\nI would have loved your maleficent costume.\n\nYeah thats the part that hurt the most, is that they would be so snarky about a casual restaurant where noone discussed what they were gonna wear.", "Hey, thanks for your reply. As mentioned in the post. \"We even went as far as offering to buy outfits for those who reached out and said they wouldn't be able to dress up due to financial reasons.\" And also we did not ask or expect gifts. IF they had dressed up that would have been the gift..", "I want a blow up dinosaur costume party!", "You could really do this.  Meet people online.  Have a Zoom or something party where everyone dresses up in front of their devices.  Digs out old prom and bridesmaid dresses if they fit.  Or just evening wear and dresser Halloween costumes.  Could be fun.", "Should probably move I guess if you don\u2019t like the only friends you have", "To be honest, I would decline too. some people are genuinely just too uncomfortable with that", "As long as the blow up dino has a tiara and a dress, she\u2019s a princess.", "It's a tough situation, I can't just move.", "INFO: Is it normal for your group of friends to dress up to go to restaurants? \n\nI might dress a little nicer going to a nice restaurant but it would be too much effort to dress up for a house party. Wearing nice adult wear is different from dressing up as a princess, especially if you have to go and buy special clothes that you would most likely only wear once. \n\nEven if a friend offered to pay I would have said no as it would be silly to just buy something and only wear it once. \n\nYour friends might have coordinated not to dress up just so that none of them feels weird about standing out. \n\nAlso, at 18 years old, it feels really silly to be upset about what people wear to your party.", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted as all hell for this, but YTA. You do realize that having a princess party at 18 is absurd, right? \n\nDo you think anyone wants to admit they can\u2019t afford a princess dress if it\u2019s out of their price range? \n\nDo you think your friends WANT to dress up like Cinderella and Prince Charming as adults? You and your sister are far in the minority there.\n\nThey went out for a nice dinner and dressed appropriately for the occasion. They were Perry first, yes, but I can\u2019t imagine anything more mortifying than dressing up like a princess for an 18th birthday party.", "You may have gotten farther if you told the group it was a 2nd prom or something like that. Or the theme was Hollywood. I don\u2019t know your friend group but the party sounded cool\n\n\nNTA", "NTA - I\u2019m 37 and if I got invited to a Princess party I would be ecstatic! We need more reasons to dress up as adults!", "If it were just the party I would say NAH, they might not have realized how serious the costume restriction was.\n\nBut if they are capable of coordinating nice outfits for a restaurant and clearly made a point of it, why can't they do that for a party? I think a dress shirt or not over-the-top dress is still closer to prince/princess than tees and jeans. If it were a Halloween costume party or something with more ridiculous outfits, I get it. But they couldn't be like \"idk what to wear, maybe just what we'd normally wear out to dinner?\"", "many of my cousins had dress up parties for their 18ths or 21st and i will tell you every single person dressed up in theme ranging from new born children to my 80 year old grandparents. the spirit is always there and it\u2019s a fun way to say goodbye to childhood", "As I mentioned it was a party like we had when we were kids. It was MEANT to be childish and just goofy.", "I\u2019m in my mid 20\u2019s and reading this all I thought was \u201cok for my next birthday we\u2019re doing princesses\u201d. I\u2019m poor(ish) but I can afford a two dollar plastic tiara and have nice dresses in my closet. They proved that they had nice clothes they could\u2019ve worn but didn\u2019t. That was quite mean. I\u2019m friends with almost no one I was friends with at 18 (barring a few close ones) you\u2019ll make new friends in time who treat you with respect.\n\nAlso your boyfriends sound amazing! I hope to find myself a partner who is willing to dress like a prince for me!", "Yes. 18 is no longer a kid.", "Dinosaur princess party maybe? I think it would be a blast", "That's it. I'm throwing a new costume party. All you guys are invited. <3", "I'm a princess. I went into a thrift store where I know the manager, she handed me a plastic crown and said \"Now you're a princess\". I proudly wore it.", "When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\n\n- C.S. Lewis", "Princess Triceratops!", "I have a fancy tiara I wore while watching the King\u2019s coronation. \ud83d\udc51 no shame in being a princess \ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffb", "Yes, you can! A random person on the internet said so! Seriously, though, NTA. If they dislike the theme of your party, they can tell you in advance. If they want cute photos after dinner, they can tell you in advance. Being upset in your position sounds completely understandable to me.", "I'm jealous"]}
