I can't stand musicals and didn't want the tickets but I know my best friend Nicole would like them. She's talked about wanting to see the show live before and her birthday was coming up so I thought to give her them. We (my wife and I) were at the birthday party and when my wife saw Nicole open the gift she was pissed. Nicole was so happy she was crying. Meanwhile my wife was fuming and dragged me out of the house asking what the hell I was thinking. I told her what I've told you all here. \n\nMy wife started crying too (upset as opposed to Nicole being happy) and told me that she wanted to see the show live for the past 3 years or so.  She also told me she was the one to introduce Nicole to the 'fandom' and that she was hurt that I would think of Nicole before her. \ud83d\ude44 I told my wife I wasn't picking favorites and that Nicole's birthday was just sooner and I didn't have a gift for her yet so I gave her the tickets. My wife said I could have given them to her for Christmas but I told her to stop being greedy and that Christmas was two weeks away so it wouldn't be much of a Christmas gift. \n\nI went back outside and left my wife outside to cool off/collect herself. Nicole was really really happy and couldn't stop thanking me. After about a half hour I went back outside to have my wife come back in because she was being rude but I couldn't find her. I later found out she took an uber home. \n\nIt's been four days and she hasn't spoken to me.

Instead of gifting them to her, you chose your friend. Were you afraid you\u2019d have to go? Your wife clearly communicated why she\u2019s upset and you\u2019re dismissing it.

It\u2019s kinda wild that you couldn\u2019t see that YOU are the issue.

Since when do you need a special occasion to give your wife something nice? And putting a friend before your spouse? Gross, dude.", "YTA. \n\nThe correct way to have handled it would have been - assuming it\u2019s two tickets - to have let your wife know you were given two tickets and ask her if she was interested in seeing if Nicole wanted to go with her since you know they both want to see it and you have no interest.\n\nInstead you have made it clear to your wife, you may as well take out a billboard to make it official, that you pay zero attention to her and she is not your priority.", "YTA.

Your first instinct was to give them to a woman who is not your wife, even though you HAD to have known how into this stuff your wife was.

Not even because of the tickets, but because the way you treated her when she told you she was upset and why. Choosing to put another woman's feelings ahead of your wife is NOT ok. \n\nMy guess is you are building a relationship with Nicole and cheating whether emotionally amd/or physically and you are more annoyed at the fact your wife is in the way.

Of course it seems like prefer Nicole: you\u2019ve given your friend this really thoughtful gift that your wife has been coveting FOR YEARS. Maybe this isn\u2019t the case, but it reads like you\u2019ve put more time/thought into the gifts you select for Nicole than for your wife; then you blindsided her at the party.

Did you want to take Nicole with your as her birthday gift?\u201d\n\nYou say NOTHING, gift them to a friend and the are confused as to why your wife is upset? The fact its not her birthday/too soon for Christmas is irrelevant. You got something for FREE that you KNEW she would enjoy immensely and gave it away! You\u2019re totally the A-hole here\n\nQuestion, do you even like your wife? Why wasn\u2019t giving them to her your first thought? I\u2019m wondering if you have a crush on your best friend and that\u2019s why you gave them to her instead\n\nI can pretty much guarantee your wife is thinking about what other crappy/less than stellar stuff you\u2019ve done over your marriage and wondering if it\u2019s time for her to pull the plug? You might think I\u2019m exaggerating, but I\u2019m sure if you took an honestly hard look at your past behaviours it wouldn\u2019t be that surprising. This could very well be \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d\n\nThis might be salvageable, but you\u2019re going to have to do a lot of hard work. Like buying her tickets to this show, and not the cheap seats either. Really really good, expensive ones.

Give them to her now and call it an early present.  It doesn\u2019t matter they were free, you didn\u2019t think of your wife first.

Option C is you have no idea how relationships are supposed to work and can expect to give your wife a life of playing second fiddle until she dumps you for someone that thinks of her first before someone who you say is just a friend.\n\nNext time get Nicole a bottle of wine.

I told her what I've told you all here. \n\nMy wife started crying too (upset as opposed to Nicole being happy) and told me that she wanted to see the show live for the past 3 years or so.  She also told me she was the one to introduce Nicole to the 'fandom' and that she was hurt that I would think of Nicole before her. \ud83d\ude44 I told my wife I wasn't picking favorites and that Nicole's birthday was just sooner and I didn't have a gift for her yet so I gave her the tickets. My wife said I could have given them to her for Christmas but I told her to stop being greedy and that Christmas was two weeks away so it wouldn't be much of a Christmas gift. \n\nI went back outside and left my wife outside to cool off/collect herself. Nicole was really really happy and couldn't stop thanking me. After about a half hour I went back outside to have my wife come back in because she was being rude but I couldn't find her.

He is totally the AH for that!", "Why can he not gift a present to his female friend?", "Exactly! My favorite band was having a concert near my town, my partner doesn't particularly like them but he surprised me with tickets and we both went to the concert together.

Problem would have been solved, but instead he created an entirely different one.", "Right?? I would be LIVID. YTA.", "Yeah, I\u2019m left wondering who he truly loves based not only on his actions, but also the tone he uses to describe the two ladies here. \n\nOP is a massive AH.", "I don't think she threw a fit in public. She took him outside, and it didn't sound like anyone inside knew about it.", "This. This is exactly it. He didn't give the tickets to his wife because he knew he'd be expected to go with her and didn't want to be because he doesn't like musicals.

Yeah men and women can be friends, but if the priority of his attention and thoughtfulness should be his wife not the friend. Because in the real world, his friend is not dealing with a commitment and everything that comes with it.\n\nDismissing his wife's feelings to be the cool friend isn't the flex you want it to be and it isn't unhinged to want attention and thoughtfulness from your husband, otherwise his wife would just be another friend and not his partner.", "This", "Common EverythingDestroyed_ L", "Op has since commented that they KNEW his wife wanted to see this show... \n\nOp has his head so far up his own backside that things are starting to smell normal again, hence why he wonders if he's truly the asshole.", "yeah her not finding out about it until the friend opened it is Wild. the whole thing is entirely on him. i hope the friend takes the wife.", "That's what I keep asking when I see these posts...", "Not as much as he cares for Nicole.

Like the minute you got married you chose a favorite in all situations such as this.", "I dno, I think he\u2019s an AH for making the mistake. He pays enough attention to know his friend likes the musical, but not enough attention to his wife to know she likes the musical and is the one that got the friend into it. Unless his wife has never once mentioned the musical to him (which I highly doubt is the case) then it would seem his attention is focused on the wrong person. If I had been wanting to see a show for 3 years and my partner was so unaware of my desires that they gifted tickets to that show to someone else, I\u2019d be seriously questioning how they feel about me.", "Also wife introduced Nicole to them. Why not give it to both of them?", "This should be too comment. This post wreaks of OP's utter disregard of and distain for his wife while he's hyper aware of Nicole's wants, needs, reactions.\n\nYTA OP, you're such an abysmal partner for doing this then gaslighting your wife about it afterwards.\n\nInfo: Has Nicole not even asked why you didn't give them to your wife given she was the one who introduced her to the fandom?", "This, the whole things really reads as he didn\u2019t want to be asked to go with her, so he gave it to a friend that wouldn\u2019t ask him.", "This is the correct answer.", "Lmao \ud83e\udd23 this was my favorite", "Marinara flags everywhere", "Or at least what to bang her \n\nNo man pays that much attention to a woman he doesn't want to bang  \n\nPoor wife", "as a fellow nicole, we don\u2019t claim her", "Extended mix.", "Spot on!", "I dedicate this next song to OP - \"Congratulations\" \n\n(I'm fond of the mixtape version).", "Or she's picking a place that's high and dry in New Jersey.

He is such an AH", "Three different things that we know of from a singular post. Imagine what else we could add to the list if we knew more.  Major yikes. Not only a YTA vote but OP sounds extra dreadful. Footnote to add how Christmas being \u201c2 weeks away\u201d is like it\u2019s far in the future and wrapping them up for her would be absurd so far in advance. 2 weeks!!!  When does this AH do their shopping???", "Are they boning yet? Or is he just trying to bone?", "He probably hasn't.  Seems that as soon as OP secures a partner, he stops caring about them at all.

If your partner has wanted to see something for three years, and you win tickets, it shouldn't even be a question who gets to go.
