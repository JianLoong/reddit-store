Seen people with visual and mobility impairments use in UK.", "If he were able-bodied, sure.  But ACL surgery is painful and that pain lasts a long while.  If he's still on crutches, things aren't stable yet so walking around is going to be painful (and the way in which one's knee feels in this state is off-putting).  Making someone do this is a lot more to ask than a 3 hour trip, which absolutely is nothing at all.  I've had work commutes that resulted in a daily 3 hour drive.  She is selfish.", "I've already said she can say no. But if he ends up damaging his knee permanently on a crowded train then that's on her.\n\nBtw you realise a) she said the child will sleep in the car so they're not going to be a major problem and b) he can look after the child on the way back right if there's any problems", "Nah, it's not a big ask.  Not my first choice of activities, but it's not that hard.", "It was a work trip. His work is responsible for him getting home with his current disability in mind. At least they are in the UK where we have workers rights.\n\nThis is very much a work related issue.\n\n(Btw the same would apply to being pregnant, in this situation the work would also have to provide a taxi for her getting home if she felt public transport with luggage was too much for her in her condition)", "Gotta get that neurodivergence in there, whether stated or not!", "That was for his work to ensure he got home in that condition. In the UK there are legal requirements called reasonable adjustments that cover this.", "For me, it would be a big ask. But it might not be to you.", "You keep repeating the same bullshit about \u201chis work should be responsible, his work should cover this\u201d. THEY AREN\u2019T. Get over it. No one cares about what they do in the UK. Now if roles were reversed, you\u2019d be singing a different tune. Saying, \u201chow could be not pick his wife up from the airport\u201d.", "[deleted]", "I mean, I've babysat and worked in daycares. I'm pregnant rn and my inlaws live an hour away so my baby will definitely be taking hour long car trips. You're just a bad parent that doesn't know how to plan properly.", "Yeah, that's not true in the US.", "Asking someone to navigate a train with luggage when they are still on crutches from an ACL surgery is a huge ask.  Driving in a car for a few hours, even if you have to listen to a screaming baby, merely annoying.  Pain and increased risk of permanent injury certainly trumps slight discomfort.", "No is always an acceptable answer.", "People in this dub have never been with a kid apparently. It is so funny that people with 0 experience with children (and probably teenagers) have the guts to tell other people how to parent .", "Tbh, I wouldn't expect him to take the train, I'd expect him to take an Uber or taxi. Even if he paid for it himself."]}
