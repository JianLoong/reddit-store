Well my birthday comes and goes and all I it was him wishing me happy birthday, didn't even take me out for dinner for my birthday. I spent the day at home by myself, not like there is anything wrong with that, but at least wanted to go out to dinner the night on my birthday. The next day I went to hangout with a friend who did take me out for my birthday. That weekend i had my nephew over so we didn't do much as a couple then either. Days and weeks pass and still no plans or gifts. We go help my parents on their farm 2 weeks later and then come home and go out to dinner at one of the places that offer you a free meal for your birthday. Now it's the end of the month and a random Amazon box shows up 23days after my birthday. Mind you I didn't order anything from Amazon, which has one or two day shipping in my area depending on the item. I tell my fiance to return the gift an get his money back, cause I don't want his petty gift.

NTA. Really, if you were clear and specific about what you wanted there's no excuse. Reconsider this man, he's showing you EXACTLY how much effort he really thinks you are worth.", "Oh, dear.

Girl, you deserve better and you know it. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my husband for 13 years and only recently married. On his birthday this year, I had his favorite dinner and chocolate cake waiting for him when he got back from work. I don\u2019t like / eat chocolate. He came home with my fav flowers and a slice of carrot cake for me on HIS birthday. It\u2019s been over a decade and he still sweeps me off my feet. \n\nYou deserve that kind of love and thoughtfulness.\n\nPS, I hate surprise gifts. We don\u2019t do surprises in this house. We kind of always know things the other want, from small to big ticket items, and we always give each other either or options to better understand what the other would want / appreciate more at that time.", "NTA, Wow, that was an actual smack in the face to you.   I'd tell him where he could shove that gift and his proposal.", "NTA at all. So thoughtless. But what was in the box??? Don\u2019t leave us hanging!", "why are you marrying a covert narcissist with a haording problem", "NTA\n\n\nDoes he normally take you for granted? Or has this been a recent thing? Think hard on this. Are there other things that has been going on in the last year or two of your relationship that raise questions or red flags?\n\nYou need to have a hard talk with yourself and with him about the future of your relationship. You don't want to marry someone who doesn't show you the level of love and respect that you need/want.", "NTA. But be careful. The thing about gifts is that they are gifts. They are not owed. So I think that if he gives you something, you should say thank you. And then sit him down for a calm talk about why you are disappointed. Ask him why he didn't listen to you. Like I would just leave room for conversation before getting instantly mad. That way, you maintain the moral high ground throughout the situation. You will feel better about yourself if you guys do end up breaking up if you were able to keep calm and speak respectfully about your feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It does say \u201cromantic\u201d on the many descriptions so maybe that was the experience he, in his mind, was trying to give you. But if he wanted to turn your bedroom into a love hotel he could have made a bigger effort. Still NTA."]}
