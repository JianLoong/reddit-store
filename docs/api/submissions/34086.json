With him so much older than me, it often felt like he was a second dad to me.  Not only did he give advice and guidance, but he also paid for things out of his own pocket; took me on road trips, paid for movies/restaurants, let me borrow his car, etc.  Even when I was a young adult after high school, he let me stay in his apartment, rent free for a month, before I got my first job.  Not only that, he bought me a suit for my first job interview.  All this was really great and I'm very fortunate to have a brother that looked out for me.  He has been looking out for me for as long as I can remember.\n\nHowever, also for as long as I can remember, he has told me \u201cYou'll pay me back one day.\"  The first time I remember him saying this I was 5 years old and he was 16 years old.  Every time he would do something nice for me, he told me \u201cYou'll pay me back one day.\"  Being told this since a very young age, I automatically believed it was true and agreed that I would pay him back.  Even into my early 20's, I felt that I really owed him and that I needed to pay him back at some point.  I did do nice things for him when I had the opportunity, but not nearly to the scale that he did for me.  Being so much younger, I just couldn\u2019t do as much for him as he did for me.\n\nFast-forward to today, I'm 32 years old and a dad.  When I do nice things for my kid, I can't imagine saying \"You'll pay me back one day.\"  In fact, I think that anyone that would try to instill a feeling of monetary debt in a young child is a total asshole.  A young child doesn't have the mental capacity to understand what this means or the ability to consent to debt.\n\nI have a small business and my brother recently told me that, because he helped me so much while I was growing up, he should be given 20% of the revenue in perpetuity.  I was shocked.  I refused to pay him he was extremely upset.\n\nI've sense decided that I don't owe him any money and that he may have been psychologically manipulating me since I was a young child.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to give money to my brother?\n\nIs my brother the asshole for expecting money from me?", "created_utc": 1703991009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uxelv/aita_for_not_paying_back_my_older_brother_that/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wad thinking if anyone needs to pay him back its your parents. It's their job to parent you. But even then, what you mentioned is all his decisions. He decided to bring u out etc. Your parents didn't ask him to do it from the info given. Don't give in to his absurd request bc u think u need to pay him back. He is being delusional.", "NTA. But I would tho give him a one time sum to clear my own conscience. For example, would everything he did amount to about 2-3k (just guesswork, give him the amount you feel is right), pay it and be done with it. If you can afford it ofc. \n\nAlong with it, tell him your thoughts about telling children they \u201cowe\u201d adults money, him trying to come back and collect it, the way he went about it etc etc has lost him your respect forever.", "You definitely aren\u2019t wrong.  He isn\u2019t, either, \u2018cause he was parentified.\n\nWhat would I do?  If you\u2019re able to stomach it, gift $10000 or a reasonable estimate of how much money he spent on you over the years, whichever is more, and make sure he knows you\u2019re giving it to him in appreciation for his efforts way back then.\n\nNAH", "NTA, the only one entitled to receive 20% of the income from your business in perpetuity would be the owner of 20% of the business.\n\nHis request is unreasonable, and it is not your obligation to 'pay him' for everything he did.\n\nBut I have many doubts about his motivation for asking for such a large amount of money.

When I do nice things for my kid, I can't imagine saying \"you owe me\" every time.  In fact, I think that anyone that would try to instill a feeling of debt in a young child is a total asshole.  A young child doesn't have the mental capacity to understand what this means or the ability to consent to \"debt.\"\n\n  \nA few months ago, my brother, now 43 years old, said to me \"Remember all the things I did for you?  You owe me.\"  I responded, \"Tell me how much and I'll pay you.\"  He didn't respond to my comment, but a few minutes later said \"You know you owe me.\"  Again, I replied, \"Tell me how much and I'll pay you.\"  He responded, \"Naw, I know you'll take care of me in the future.\"\n\n  \nNow to the current issue.  I started a business that is finally starting to make some money.  My brother told me that, because he helped me so much while I was growing up, he should be given 20% of the revenue.  I was shocked.  I told him that it's a small business and I can't afford to give a percentage away to someone that isn't contributing to the business.  My brother was extremely upset.\n\n  \nAm I the asshole for not paying him back for all the things he did for me?  A few months ago, he declined my offer to pay him and now he wants 20% of my business in perpetuity.  I've sense decided that I don't owe him any money and that he may have been psychologically manipulating me since I was a young child.  In this situation, should he even expect to get money from me for things he did for me while I was growing up?  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It won't stop at 10k you'll be doing it forever. \n\nNTA", "Does OP\"s brother have children? \n\nIf yes, then I would suggest OP do something like start a 529 saving account for the future education of OP's niblings.\n\nOP is  NTA for refusing their brother's demand.", "My brother does not have financial problems.  He did not give up his education or personal life for me in any way.  Our parents were around and took care of basic needs. They just didn't understand the benefit of providing much more than food, shelter, and education opportunities.  They would pay for additional things if specifically asked and if the purchase was justified.  The difficulty while growing up is that I often didn't know what I needed and thus didn't know to specifically ask for it.\n\nMy brother sometimes paid for things that our parents would have if I had asked.  Like the example I mentioned, when my brother bought me a suit before my first job interview.  If I had asked our parents, they would have paid for it.  But before it even occurred to me that I needed a suit, my brother took me out to buy one and paid for it without me ever asking.  In retrospect, I could have refused and instead asked our parents, but that also didn't occur to me at the time.", "Yes this is the right response it was super close to N-A-H, but the whole wanting 20% in perpetuity is a little absurd \nDefinitely NTA and to hold things over you that he did on his own is an AH move. He was parentified and he definitely feels some type of way about it but he shouldn\u2019t take that out on OP.", "I was only suggesting a one-time thing.  Anything more than that would make the brother a raging asshole.", "I didn\u2019t even think of that.  It\u2019s a really good idea and one OP should definitely consider.", "Right! I know details aren\u2019t provided, but I\u2019m guessing the brother had a lot of trauma during childhood. I hope he can work with a therapist or something to work through his past. Demanding compensation from OP is clearly not the way.", "What is the 10k for exactly? Their brother is already an AH", "The brother won\u2019t be happy with a one time payment. You give an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile. OP doesn\u2019t owe his brother anything from his business. He can continue to repay the nice acts by doing nice acts for his brother but he\u2019s doesn\u2019t need to just pay him straight cash. There\u2019s no obligation to do so.", "OP can continue to repay him with kind acts and taking care of outings together but they\u2019re under no obligation to pay the brother in cold hard cash.", "It\u2019s basically \u201cshut up\u201d money.", "Yes, completely agree.", "I wouldn't go there, don't feed the entitled behaviour."]}
