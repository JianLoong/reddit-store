NTA but this won't go away.", "Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.\n\nThis is a quote from C.S. Lewis that I feel very much applies here.  Honestly, your situation resonates with me.  I am an avid gamer and have been for years.  It's a hobby that I have a great passion for!  But I also have people telling me that it's childish and that I should move on from it.  It's a ridiculous assertion coming from people with insecurities about their reputations.  I recently read a story about an elderly couple who settle their differences with a game of Mario Kart 64.  Then there's the more well known example of Shirley Curry (I think that's how her name is spelled?) who is known as the Skyrim Grandma.  Gaming is not only for kids.\n\nMy advice would be to sit down and have a talk with your girlfriend.  Let her know that you are already compromising your time with your favorite hobby for her sake.  What happens next depends on what her reaction is.  That I leave to you.

Even if she doesn't enjoy it, she should be happy that you do in my opinion.

Your comment was clearly meant in jest.\n\nBut I\u2019ve never known an avid gamer (including myself) who can really stop after one hour.

What does she do with her time when you're not around? \n\nYou are entitled to have your personal hobbies, as long as you have enough time to spend with each other. You are already trying to accommodate her feelings by playing when she is not around, and cutting your play time- you're fine. However, she expects you stop completely, and it appears that you have not addressed that issue with her. Why? Do not make jokes about this- that is disrespectful.

I really have to ask you this, how long will it be before she makes other demands that concern your life that she doesn't \"approve\" of?\n\nNTA in this situation, you have gone out of your way to accommodate to your girlfriends wishes by reducing the time playing games, but she can't dictate you to stop playing games entirely. I could sort of understand her being \"grumpy\" if you spent all your free time to play games with friends and spent not a single moment with your girlfriend, but you clearly don't neglect her in favor of games and friends.  Perhaps you should ask her if she has problems with your friends or that you playing games is something she was denied in her own childhood (anyone can love/hate playing games regardless of your gender)\n\nEdit: if she refuse to give you a proper explanation to her problem with you playing games and spending time with friends then perhaps you should consider running for the hills, since the man she pictures you to be and the man you truly are at heart are as different as night and day", "NTA\n\nMy partner enjoys video games, I do not.

The gaming symbolizes the disconnect for her, but might not actually be the source. \n\nI have learned that simple relationship maintenance can solve a lot. Occasional loving texts, spending time talking, random hugs and affection, checking in etc\u2026. Many women like romance and \u201csappy\u201d stuff.   Many men are oblivious and think they just have to work, make money, and do their chores and the relationship should be peachy.  There\u2019s an emotional component to relationships that doesn\u2019t come easily to men and it takes work, but when you stay connected it can be really fulfilling. \n\nLook into \u201cLove Language\u201d and talk to each other about it. You might find that it\u2019s not the gaming, maybe you need to hug her more, or take her on dates, write love letters, probably something relatively simple.

If you, OP, are playing video games from dusk till dawn, has zero input in your relationship and doesn\u2019t help out nor spend time with your partner then yes that is a problem.  Clearly this isn\u2019t the case.  \n\nHealthy gaming is fundamental and is fun.  Perhaps before she make blanket statement about gaming being immature, maybe she should try playing some games and then decide.  If she is adamant she has no interest in gaming she need to find a hobby.  A healthy relationship is where both parties have interests that keeps them occupied and keep them sane.

My son is a gamer and so is my son in law. Neither will ever give it up, or stop dedicating long hours per day to it. Gamers need partners who will understand, or at least tolerate it it, whereas your gf is just waiting for you to stop it. I've read posts on here of intolerant gf's going and selling all the consoles and games. You need to have a real heart to heart to explain you will never give it up, not even if you have kids, on the contrary, you will be introducing the kids to it.

This is not an issue that will go away. How likely are you to stop gaming to make her happy (and how will that affect your relationship)? How likely is she to accept that gaming is important to you and to stop nagging you about it and being jealous? Have you sat down with her to have a real discussion about this, because it sounds like something that needs to happen and you need to be ready for the outcome, whatever it might be.\n\nHonestly, for someone who keeps telling you she thinks your hobby is \"childish\", she sure isn't showing a lot of maturity.

If you were constantly playing, to the point of neglecting household chores or spending time with your girlfriend, that would be a problem.  But it sounds like you aren't doing that, and your girlfriend seems to just hate the idea of an adult playing video games at all.  The whole \"this hobby is childish\" thing is not a good argument.  There are tons of adults that play video games, and there's nothing wrong with having a \"childish\" hobby.  You shouldn't have to completely cut off a hobby that you love just because she doesn't approve.  She can find her own hobby to entertain herself while you are spending your one hour playing games.

I don't interfere with Thursdays. I bought him his Xbox that he currently plays with. While I don't share his love, I support it, and do occasionally try to either watch or sometimes partake.
