Don\u2019t be mean to him. He probably doesn\u2019t know how to talk to people in general and is especially nervous around women. Whether or not you say no, be mindful that you\u2019re talking to someone who probably doesn\u2019t understand subtext or social cues and, if you take an accusatory or suspicious tone - and, believe it, or not, most autistic people can tell -  will get either flustered and run away or otherwise defensive because he doesn\u2019t understand or realize what he did wrong (and he did nothing wrong other than not follow unwritten and unspoken social norms he probably doesn\u2019t know exist).", "Run it by your insurance agent.

If he parks on your driveway, and something happens to his truck, he will harass you till you pay to get it fixed.\n\nBy denying him parking space, you remove that possibility (and liability).\n\nHe can park somewhere else, it is his problem, not yours.", "NTA\n\nIf Rob wants to use your driveway as his own then ask him to pay for parking. \n\nPersonally I'd say no because it will just end up becoming problematic", "Nta, stand your ground. Also, when you tell him no, I would make sure you are recording it, even on the downlow(check local laws). I would just want proof of saying no, and any bad reaction that follows because he sounds like someone whos going to start a shitstorm. Alternatively, you could send a registered letter saying no, and have a copy plus reciept for a future paper trail. Video or audio document any future interactions, you might need them later.", "NTA It\u2019s not your problem, nor is it the neighbourly thing to do. Neighbours share salt and tools, not driveways.", "Tell him to ask another neighbor.", "The best neighbors are the ones who keep to themselves. Do not let this guy park in your driveway \"indefinitely\". If he were kind and warm I would give you the same advice.

I am definitely considering putting up cones in the evening to prevent the truck from parking in our drive to drop him off.", "Yes, he sounds neurodivergent. He also sounds like he has the potential to get angry - he got \"pissed\" because wife didn't remember his name and she's uncomfortable around him. Lived places where hard to go out because neighbour always demanded my attention with potential to escalate to violence if refused and not great way to live. \n\nIf he is asking to use property that is not his, then he understands it is not his and hopefully can take a no.", "I dunno, I\u2019d get mad at a dude using my driveway constantly.", "Talked to her about the situation after posting this- she said that he was really pushy while talking to her outside about the truck, and she was frightened.

He is rude and inconsiderate.  NTA.", "Then definitely don't let him use your property. He seems to be more pushy with your wife and waiting until she is alone to raise demands. Consider a ring camera.\n\nIf has a lot of reasons to be on your property, he is likely to up his demands.\n\nEdited: typo", "In case it\u2019s not elsewhere - get a camera for your front door, just in case!", "Tell him you spoke with your insurance agent, and have been told you can't take on the liability.

You might need to convince a male friend/family member to back you up when you confront him.", "The driveway butts up against the road and has large drop-offs on either side. It might work but it will making parking for us and guests much less convenient. If he moves our cones and continues to park I\u2019ll invest in a camera and call a tow truck. I do appreciate the idea, though! I\u2019ll look into it.", "You could do a pole style tip up gate. Basically a pipe several feet off the ground that has a pivot point and drops into a yoke on the other side.  Mounted with a counterweight it could be tilted up with one hand easily.  You see them in parking garages and private parking lots often because they don't need slide or swing open space", "Definitely NTA.  Politely tell your neighbor something along the lines of \"we talked about your request to use our driveway and came to a decision.  We're not comfortable sharing our driveway at this time.  If that changes we will let you know.  Thank you for asking.\"  When he asks \"why not?\" and/or starts to demand reasons, just say \"I'm sorry but the answer is no.\"  DO NOT GIVE A REASON.  This part is important.  If you give a reason against his request, you open up the argument.  Do not give him a solvable issue that he can try to resolve.  Do not engage at all on the issues.  You may have to repeat \"I'm sorry, no.\"  Be polite the entire time.\n\nEdit:  after one or two \"I'm sorry, no\" statements, do not respond to the issue again.  Change the subject.  It might be handy to have another subject in mind to make the switch seamless.", "NTA. There are many reasons why he should not park on your driveway. Many! However, he does not need a list because it is not his property and he has no right to impose on you. If his property  does not meet his needs he should either move to another that does or arrange to rent a parking space from another neighbour. A willing neighbour who would appreciate the extra money!\n\nIt should, of course, be you who tells him that he can no longer park there, since he intimidates your wife.", "\"No\" is an entire sentence.   You don't have to be friends with this guy.", "Grow a spine and tell that dude no.", "Well, you\u2019ve certainly no obligation to let him use it, but you could let him use it with the understanding that when you have guests over, one of them can park in his driveway. \n\nThat covers the issue of him taking up space that you need from time to time and prevents things from being even weirder between you.", "He sounds special needs", "First up I wouldn\u2019t have started from here. No you cannot use our land to store your valuable property is a basic rule of life. Of course you\u2019re liable because you consented to this foolish arrangement. I\u2019d love to hear your home insurers views. Grace is either dangerously naive or intimated by Rob\u2019s weirdness, maybe both. Agreeing to host his vehicle as a way of avoiding him seems a strange decision, because now he has a reason to come on your property and interact with you every day. You have to stop this now nothing about it is sensible. NTA", "NTA we talked about it and no you can't park here but we appreciate you asking have a good day. Anything after isn't needed or cared about. Get cameras for the house. Let him know if he parks there he will towed. Record the conversation for evidence. Tell Grace to be mindful when outside especially since he has a habit of approaching her.", "NTA - He wants to park there? $200 a month! But honestly, I wouldn't even do that. He needs to tell his work there isn't any space for his work truck or figure that shit out on his own.", "NTA your property so politely decline and if he ignores, block him in", "NTA.\nDo not give this weirdo any reason to be in your space. A potentially awkward denial now will save you years of frustration.", "NTA, but there's a reason he approaches Grace and not you. Seems like he knows she is more of a pushover than you are. He also sounds like a creep. I would put cameras up.", "NTA. Neighbors across from us have a smaller driveway than we do and have 5-6 vehicles. Our house sat empty for a year before we bought it which I assume is when they started parking in our driveway and directly in front of our house. There is a walkway from our porch to that front parking spot. Anyway. Last year I was very pregnant and wanted to park in front of my house to use the walkway, as to not trip and fall. I would get home and they\u2019d be there. We repeatedly asked them not to park there and they\u2019d move, but would do it again the next day. Finally my fianc\u00e9 threatened to tow their car to the empty lot a block away with his truck if they didn\u2019t move it. It hasn\u2019t happened again, thankfully, though they now park in their direct neighbors driveway frequently. I think it\u2019s pretty rude, and it\u2019s not your problem the work truck doesn\u2019t fit. I would possibly invest in a gate at the bottom of your driveway to block unwanted visitors.", "NTA, and you\u2019re right not to allow this, but don\u2019t get into a fight about it. Find an excuse he can\u2019t argue.\n\nIf it were me? I\u2019d tell him you consulted your with insurance company, who said that on the policy you\u2019re have, you are not to permit parking on your property by anyone other than permanent residents and temporary guests visiting your home, so you\u2019re very sorry but you can\u2019t allow it, then wish him good day and say you have to run an errand.\n\nBe polite, firm, and leave before there can be discussion. With strangers you\u2019re uncomfortable with but cannot escape, like weird neighbours, sometimes lying is the best option.", "Yes it would be \"neighborly\" to let him park there, but getting caught up with people pleasing would not be advisable. You WNBTA if you choose to not let him park there, as there is a parking lot nearby.", "Are you in an HOA? Some HOA do not allow work trucks to park on property overnight. Is he doing this so you get the fine instead of him?", "NTA. Put up a sign. Private property. Violators will be towed. Extra points for adding rhe name# of the towing company.", "This is the way.   I also have an odd neighbor, he\u2019s on the spectrum and an odd duck.  He\u2019s actually very lovely, and asks me frequently if I know his name.  It\u2019s just his thing.

Rob is terrified of our extremely friendly 35-lbs Aussie mix.", "Yeah, he definitely corners her because she\u2019s very polite and quiet.

Part of the reason we moved here is because it\u2019s a nice area with no HOA.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s neurodivergent, I think he\u2019s just old and visibly uncomfortable that we are queer and tries to use being a tall man to his advantage. \nI think he approaches my wife and not me because I am autistic and not very friendly.", "Yeah, I'd be concerned.
