When we moved in four months ago, we were visited by the neighbor across the street, Rob (50s/M). He was visibly uncomfortable and awkward while speaking to us, but was polite overall. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it until the next time he came over to our house. He approached Grace while she was figuring out a new electric lawnmower, and asked her if she \u201chad ever mowed a lawn before,\u201d and if she \u201cknows how photosynthesis works.\u201d He also asked if Grace remembered his name despite us meeting only once briefly. Grace responded \u201cyes, I\u2019ve mowed lots of lawns before, this is just a new lawnmower and I\u2019m figuring it out. Remind me of your name?\u201d Rob just said \u201cnow I\u2019m pissed\u201d and stormed off. \n\nI thought the interaction was weird, since Grace is extremely polite. I assumed the conversation went misunderstood and moved on.\n\nA few months go by without hearing from Rob, and I notice a truck starts parking in our driveway to drop Rob off from work. Rob and Coworker sit and talk for up to 20 minutes sometimes. I\u2019m uncomfortable with this, since nobody asked to use our drive, but I let it go after Grace assured me it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n \nTonight, when Grace was bringing home dinner after dark, he approached Grace while she was exiting her vehicle and yelled \u201cI don\u2019t mean to scare you!\u201d\n\nWhich, obviously, scared her. He launched into a story about how he finally has a truck from work, but his driveway has walls and an incline; it\u2019s too narrow for him to exit the truck. He asked Grace if he could park his truck in our driveway after work.\n\n We only have one car, but have 2 gravel driveways that can fit 3-5 vehicles between them. There\u2019s no street parking on our road, but there are a couple of lots nearby/within walking distance. We often have guests over for game nights and such, and usually fill the driveway up during those days. \n\n Grace asked him how long he would need the driveway, and he said \u201cindefinitely, it won\u2019t fit anywhere else.\u201d She let him park for the night and told him we would talk it over and get back to him. \n\nI\u2019m worried about liability issues and that I don\u2019t know or trust Rob. I think he\u2019s weird and impolite, and I\u2019m worried he will take advantage of us. Grace says telling him yes is the neighborly thing to do, and that I am being overly suspicious and critical of Rob.

Draw a clear boundary and enforce it. He\u2019s seeing how much he can walk all over you both. Don\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cRob you cannot park your truck n our driveway. Ever.

He'll get over it one way or another. If he ever tries to ask for forgiveness after taking advantage of the use of your driveway, which is what he's likely done in the past before you moving in, both of you should agree on documenting it with a notice to him the cost of a tow truck service you'll have on speed dial. Best of luck to you enjoying your new home.", "NTA- That's not your problem. I would definitely worry about liability with that weirdo.

Don\u2019t be mean to him. He probably doesn\u2019t know how to talk to people in general and is especially nervous around women. Whether or not you say no, be mindful that you\u2019re talking to someone who probably doesn\u2019t understand subtext or social cues and, if you take an accusatory or suspicious tone - and, believe it, or not, most autistic people can tell -  will get either flustered and run away or otherwise defensive because he doesn\u2019t understand or realize what he did wrong (and he did nothing wrong other than not follow unwritten and unspoken social norms he probably doesn\u2019t know exist).", "Run it by your insurance agent. NTA if you tell him no, and you don\u2019t need to justify it, but insurance is a likely reason.", "NTA. Why on earth would you want someone else\u2019s truck in your driveway? What a weird thing for him to ask.", "NTA. If he parks on your driveway, and something happens to his truck, he will harass you till you pay to get it fixed.\n\nBy denying him parking space, you remove that possibility (and liability).\n\nHe can park somewhere else, it is his problem, not yours.", "NTA\n\nIf Rob wants to use your driveway as his own then ask him to pay for parking. \n\nPersonally I'd say no because it will just end up becoming problematic", "Nta, stand your ground. Also, when you tell him no, I would make sure you are recording it, even on the downlow(check local laws). I would just want proof of saying no, and any bad reaction that follows because he sounds like someone whos going to start a shitstorm. Alternatively, you could send a registered letter saying no, and have a copy plus reciept for a future paper trail. Video or audio document any future interactions, you might need them later.", "NTA It\u2019s not your problem, nor is it the neighbourly thing to do. Neighbours share salt and tools, not driveways.", "Tell him to ask another neighbor.", "The best neighbors are the ones who keep to themselves. Do not let this guy park in your driveway \"indefinitely\". If he were kind and warm I would give you the same advice. Since he's a jerk, this is a no brainer.", "Nta it's your property and I worry about squatting rights", "Sounds like a work truck so dimensions may not be his choice. But agree on rest.", "I think it was less about being \"scared to cause conflict\" and more scared that the *weird guy* who shouted at her to not be scared might hurt her in some manner if she refused.", "Unfortunately our driveway\u2019s shape doesn\u2019t allow for a gate. I am definitely considering putting up cones in the evening to prevent the truck from parking in our drive to drop him off.", "Yes, he sounds neurodivergent. He also sounds like he has the potential to get angry - he got \"pissed\" because wife didn't remember his name and she's uncomfortable around him. Lived places where hard to go out because neighbour always demanded my attention with potential to escalate to violence if refused and not great way to live. \n\nIf he is asking to use property that is not his, then he understands it is not his and hopefully can take a no.", "I dunno, I\u2019d get mad at a dude using my driveway constantly.", "Talked to her about the situation after posting this- she said that he was really pushy while talking to her outside about the truck, and she was frightened. You bring up a good point.", "A swing gate doesn't fit?  There are quite a few different styles so hopefully you could find something. This guy sounds like he'll just move your cones.", "Please don\u2019t let this guy start using your property.  This will not go well.  Your interactions so far have shown you want to expect.  He is rude and inconsiderate.  NTA.", "Then definitely don't let him use your property. He seems to be more pushy with your wife and waiting until she is alone to raise demands. Consider a ring camera.\n\nIf has a lot of reasons to be on your property, he is likely to up his demands.\n\nEdited: typo", "In case it\u2019s not elsewhere - get a camera for your front door, just in case!", "Tell him you spoke with your insurance agent, and have been told you can't take on the liability. And if he persists, you will have him towed. Sorry about the shitty neighbor", "It definitely feels like this guy has some issues with women. You might need to convince a male friend/family member to back you up when you confront him.", "The driveway butts up against the road and has large drop-offs on either side. It might work but it will making parking for us and guests much less convenient. If he moves our cones and continues to park I\u2019ll invest in a camera and call a tow truck. I do appreciate the idea, though! I\u2019ll look into it.", "You could do a pole style tip up gate. Basically a pipe several feet off the ground that has a pivot point and drops into a yoke on the other side.  Mounted with a counterweight it could be tilted up with one hand easily.  You see them in parking garages and private parking lots often because they don't need slide or swing open space"]}
