We share custody of our 7 yo son. I usually buy my son stuff and send them to his mom's house since I travel a lot for work. Thing is, I'd sometimes see his mom's husband wearing the stuff I get for him (my son) like when I bought him a dinosaur wrist band. I accidently saw his hkme's husband wearing it in a photo they posted on facebook. It kept happening and I had to speak to my ex wife and she said her husband does this while playing with our son. I expressed my grief and discomfort regarding the issue and got brushed off.\n\n\n\nLast week, I had a business meeting abroad and couldn't go with my son to watch a baseball game. I'd already bought and sent him a baseball glove a while back and later in the day, I saw a pic on facebook of his mom's husband wearing the freaking glove in his hand while taking a photo with my son. I immediately canceled my trip and went home to discuss the issue sonce my ex wife was basically minimizing the situation. I had a huge argument with her (I never speak to her husband at all) and I banned my son from letting his mom's husband touch/wear anything I got/will get for him. My ex wife started screaming at me which caused our son to cry and called me an asshole saying that her husband was just trying to let our son have fun and wearing the glove was to cheer him up/make him laugh or something. I refused to discuss it any further but she decided to escalate by calling my mom who, unusually, sided with her and told me I was veing unreasonable and unfair towards my son.\n\nI just feel like I'm protecting my boundaries after being brushed off for so long, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1699542578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rf1ns/aita_for_banning_my_son_from_letting_his_moms/", "score": 438, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What kind of lesson would your son learn if he was told \"this is just for you - don't let stepdad touch it!\" The lesson would be: my biological father is selfish, jealous and obsessive. YTA", "Respectfully, YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you're getting mad about the stuff when I think in reality you're more upset about how present your son's stepdad is in his life.\n\nBanning your son from sharing his things and experiences with his stepdad accomplishes nothing except for making you look like a controlling AH. You should want your son to have a happy and healthy relationship with the other close adult in his life. \n\nIf there are items you genuinely don't want going to Mom's house, then they need to be kept at your place.", "You are being so extra, IMO... YTA. It is only a wristband and a glove. It seems like you are actually pressed about an underlying situation- your wife's new husband is spending time with your son and building a relationship and you feel insecure about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour son is who is important- he clearly is happy to be spending time with your wife's husband and he probably doesn't think anything extra about him wearing any of the things you have bought for him.", "INFO - you seriously cancelled a business trip because this dude put on a baseball glove?\n\nAre you self employed, if not what excuse did you give your boss for canceling?\n\nThere are red flags all over this story and their all coming from you.", "YTA and should seek professional help. The jealousy you are experiencing is making you unhinged.\n\nYou're also demanding something you could never enforce.\n\nYour actions also come off as cowardly. You have no problem screaming at your ex or son but won't even speak to the man you really have the issue with. \n\nYou're coming off as bullying and controlling to the woman and child but scared of the man who is touching the things you don't like him to touch.", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t cancel the trip to spend time with your son, but you could bc you were offended? What\u2019s of true importance here?", "YTA ffs I thought how is an adult fitting into a 7 yo\u2019s clothes. Oh god, he\u2019s pissed over a wristband? Because stepdad plays baseball with his son??\n\nAll your son is going to remember is happily going along until dad came, gave him a scary ultimatum and started screaming at mom. Get a handle on that bitterness and jealousy and be grateful stepdad loves your kid and wants to make him happy. You\u2019d better start playing nice or your kid is soon going to figure out who the bad guy is and you\u2019ll alienate him for good.", "Massive YTA. Firstly, don't involve your child in your personal disputes. It is unhealthy for your son, and you are going to cause damage if you continue to do this. Secondly, stop being so jealous. You clearly are upset that your son had a loving father figure that is not you, but you should be glad that when you don't show up for your kid, there is somebody who can fill the gap that you made. Get over yourself OP, this should be about creating the best life for your child, not your ego.", "YTA. I'm not surprised you're divorced. You cancelled a business trip because your kid's stepdad was wearing a baseball glove you gave your son? That's wild.", "YTA if you don\u2019t want him touching stuff keep it at your place.  Problem solved.  You need to get over your issues with this guy tho.", "YTA. What a massive overreaction. \n\nYour ex wife shouldn\u2019t have screamed at you when your son was around\u2014but you made such a ridiculous demand that it would have taken a super human amount of self restraint not to engage.", "Weird hill to die on. YTA.", "YTA Forget everything else; you want a 7 year old to enforce whether an adult who's care he's in, can or can't borrow his stuff. This shit is psychotic. Even if the rest was perfectly fine, that is insane.\n\nImagine being your son, perpetually having to pick between hurting your feelings and the other guys feelings. What a nightmare.", "YTA\n\nOnce you give your son something it\u2019s his and he could do whatever he wants with it\n\nNow, if son came to you saying his stuff was being used without his permission that would be a different story\n\nWhy you looking at their pics anyway ?", "At first I though stepdad was wearing your sons clothes or shoes, like you bought him a really nice winter coat and now the stepdad is wearing it around. But these are small things that really raise a red flag that you are getting so angry about. A wrist band? Holding a baseball glove? It's not like the guy is posting pics saying \"look what I got my stepson!\" And claiming the things you got your son are credited to him. \n\nCalm tf down. YTA. Although your ex wife is also an ah for screaming at you in front of your son. That should have been a private conversation", "YTA.  Your son can do what he wants with the things you buy for him.  You are upset because your ex remarried and this man is involved in your son's life.  You should be happy that this man has stepped up and seems to treat your son well.  He could be a horrible step parent, but he's not.  You are jealous.", "LOL YTA! Let me get this right. You couldn't attend a baseball game with your son because you had to travel abroad for business, but then cancelled the trip to go tell off your ex because you saw your son's step dad wearing your son's baseball glove??  My guy, you seriously need to get your priorities straight.\n\nWhen you give your son a gift, that gift can then be used however your son sees fit. If he wants to let his step dad play with the gift that is your son's choice, not yours. Get a grip!", "You don't get to put boundaries or conditions on gifts you buy for your child.  It's obvious that his stepfather is more of a presence in your son's life then you are so you're attempting to buy your son's affection with gifts instead of quality time.  Especially since never once did you actually speak to your son about the situation.  The fact that you canceled a business trip in progress to run home and yell at your ex wife because of jealousy but couldn't cancel it to take your son to a baseball game is very telling of your actually priorities.  YTA", "YTA - Sounds like your son has a better and healthier father/son relationship with his step-dad and you are just salty about this.", "YTA. Cancelling a business trip is a clear over-reaction and an indication that you're not approaching this with a level-head.  Also, the fact that you go out of your way to avoid using the appropriate term, stepdad, further illustrates this.\n\n>and I banned my son from letting his mom's husband touch/wear anything I got/will get for him.\n\nThe real issue is that you are putting the responsibility on your 7 year old son to control what another adult touches. You should never put a 7 year old in a position to demand anything of a step parent. This issue is between you and the stepdad and you need to keep your son out of your drama.", ">I expressed my grief and discomfort regarding the issue and got brushed off\n\nGrief seems like an excessive reaction. Excessively excessive. Possibly that's why you were brushed off.\n\n>I'd sometimes see his mom's husband wearing the stuff I get for him\n\nIt seems this upsets you more than the fact that that his stepdad spends much more time with your son that you do. Why do you think that is? Do you think it upsets you when you keep seeing photos of them together, but you're transferring that discomfort to the wristband, glove, etc?\n\nAlso, you keep calling this guy \"his mom's husband\". He is is his stepfather.\n\nYTA. Be grateful that your son has a loving stepdad. Lots of kids do not.", "how often do you really spend time with your son? How often do you actually do something with your son?\n\nAnyway YTA.  Who is the real victim here... Your son. Be there for him. Protect him. Love him and guide him. Not make fights about him that makes him cry that much..", "Oh hey, hi there, Dad!  I wanted to let you know that this shit right here is why my siblings and I never wanted you at our weddings, graduations, parties, etc.  This is why you have about zero relationship with all of your grandchildren.  You made everything so fucking petty and awful and anxiety-ridden that we basically stopped being children before we were 10 years old.", "YTA.  You're jealous and punishing your seven year old by starting conflict and trying to create a wedge between him and his stepfather.  Stop being so fragile and selfish, if nothing else for the mental health of your son.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like there two instances of him wearing little items, not that he\u2019s stealing things from your son. \n\nFrankly, you are overreacting and creating an unhealthy environment for your son.", "Ummm\n\nBarring further information, I'd say YTA.\n\nIt appears your son is happily sharing these items with his stepdad, but if the stepdad is stealing them or using them without his permission, then I'd be on your side.  It mostly just comes off as jealousy that another man has a fatherly role in your son's life.\n\n>I just feel like I'm protecting my boundaries after being brushed off for so long, \n\nWhat boundaries? Wanting to be the only dad? You aren't, sorry.\n\nOnce you give someone a gift, the point is so they can use that.  So, no, you do not get to tell your son and his other family what they do.  If you don't want them to use it, keep it at your house for when he visits.", "YTA. \n\nWhat the heck is the problem with your son\u2019s other father figure engaging with him in a positive way? \n\nOh wait\u2026 is it because it isn\u2019t you? Because he\u2019s got someone else in his life now? Because your ex has someone else in her life now?  \n\nStop being petty and jealous.", "YTA. It\u2019s a terrible idea to express your resentment to your son. Let him be friends with his stepdad. \nI legitimately hate my kids bio dad, and I would never let them get a whiff of that from me. \n\nAs a parent, it\u2019s not about you.", "YTA. Even if your request to not have your sons step dad touch anything you buy was somehow reasonable (it\u2019s not) asking your child to set that boundary with a parent figure isn\u2019t. You\u2019re stressing out your child, give it a rest.", "INFO: I'm confused. Is the new husband taking his stuff and not returning it? I guess it a little weird that every photo has him wearing things you bought for your son, but your son is residing with him.\n\nHow is he generally with your son? Does your son every complain about new husband not returning his things or taking things away from him? \n\nYou seem way to focused on this. Are you struggling with jealousy or insecurity? Your reactions- canceling a work trip abroad and having a screaming match with your ex in front of your son- is excessive.", "YTA. \n\nI think your issue lies more with the fact that you can't be there as much as you want while stepdad can. You're feeling like you're being replaced. You should probably address the root cause and make whatever changes are necessary rather than give your son an unenforceable ultimatum against someone he also cares about.", "YTA. Btw it\u2019s not just his mom\u2019s husband. It\u2019s his stepfather. Should probably get use to that.", "YTA \n\n>I usually buy my son stuff and send them to his mom's house since I travel a lot for work.\n\nSo you buy \"stuff\" for your son, send it to where he lives, but he can't play with it?\n\nDo you play with him enough to understand what he likes to do? Sounds like his stepfather does.", "I get that divorce is hard, not seeing your kid is hard...\nBut being a kid in the middle of a divorce is FUCKING HARD. Your child is being pulled in different directions & that isn't fair.\nThings given to your child are HIS things, he can allow others to touch them. He should be able to enjoy the items you gave him with other people that love him.\nThere is nothing wrong with other people (new partners) also interacting with your child & loving them, you need to be happy his step father is kind to him & plays with him.", "I think you need to examine your feelings to determine why you're so upset by this. I mean, you cancelled a business trip to berate your ex! For your son's stepdad wearing his baseball glove! That's over the top.\n\nCould it be that you're grieving over your son having a good relationship with another father besides you? If that's it, it's nothing to be ashamed of, it seems a normal, human reaction.\n\nBut it's damaging to your son. The best thing for him is to have good, close relationships with all his family. So please figure this out. I wish you luck and peace.\n\nBut yeah, YTA.", "YTA and a big one. Your ex wife\u2019s husband is part of your son\u2019s life, that\u2019s just a fact. What you give him is no longer yours and he can do with it what he chooses. Grow up.", "YTA.

Your son clearly loves his step dad.\n\nLook, clearly you\u2019ve made your choices in terms of parenting. Your son isn\u2019t a priority-your job is. You are going to look back on your life and not wish that you had worked more, but that you had spent more time with your son.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make some major changes. Either seek therapy so you can come to terms with the fact that your son needs a father figure around and you should be grateful his step dad is filling that role since you aren\u2019t around\u2026or make some changes with your job and lifestyle and actually BE there for your son.", "Yta-", "YTA for sure.   \n\n\nYou're being petty to spite your wife's new husband and your son is getting in the crossfire.  \n\n\nI can understand the jealousy you're feeling but it's time to grow up and realize that your son has a stepfather. And it sounds like that stepfather is a LOT more present than you are.", "YTA. Obviously. the fact you even have to ask is concerning, you need to grow up.", "YTA\n\nCould it be that this kind of controlling behaviour is the reason she is now your ex wife?\n\nIf you buy your son something then its his and he can do with it as he likes.  If he wants to play with his step dad with it or get him to wear it then that's your sons prerogative.  \n\nFrom the tone of your post it doesn't sound like you are around much anyway and it seems like he has another decent father figure in his stepdad who is treating him well.", "How do you expect your son to enforce not letting his stepfather touch his stuff? You're pouring your son in a difficult position for your own pride. \n\nBoundaries are about what you will do, not about making other people do or not do things. \n\nYta", "YTA\n\nHe\u2019s not taking an Apple Watch like thanks kid \n\nHe\u2019s wearing these things *while playing with and engaging with your kid*. \n\nYou aren\u2019t with his mom anymore.

You buy stuff for your kid rather than spend time with him and then get butt hurt when stepdad steps in and tries to make your kid feel better because his father (you) disappointed him again.

I don\u2019t think the issue is actually that the stepdad is wearing the stuff. It\u2019s not like you bought your son a $200 coat that his stepdad stole for himself.

Second, how irresponsible is it to cancel an overseas business trip because of a photo? \nThird, there are a million innocent reasons for the step dad to have the glove! He could be showing your son how to effectively catch a ball. Your son may have asked him to catch while he bats. If they were at the game, maybe your son wanted him to catch a foul ball since he is taller. Maybe he was just being goofy. \nFourth, you should be JOYFUL that your son has a stepdad who seems to be good to him.

We share custody of our 7 yo son. I usually buy my son stuff and send them to his mom's house since I travel a lot for work. Thing is, I'd sometimes see his mom's husband wearing the stuff I get for him (my son) like when I bought him a dinosaur wrist band. I accidently saw his hkme's husband wearing it in a photo they posted on facebook. It kept happening and I had to speak to my ex wife and she said her husband does this while playing with our son. I expressed my grief and discomfort regarding the issue and got brushed off.\n\n\n\nLast week, I had a business meeting abroad and couldn't go with my son to watch a baseball game. I'd already bought and sent him a baseball glove a while back and later in the day, I saw a pic on facebook of his mom's husband wearing the freaking glove in his hand while taking a photo with my son. I immediately canceled my trip and went home to discuss the issue sonce my ex wife was basically minimizing the situation. I had a huge argument with her (I never speak to her husband at all) and I banned my son from letting his mom's husband touch/wear anything I got/will get for him. My ex wife started screaming at me which caused our son to cry and called me an asshole saying that her husband was just trying to let our son have fun and wearing the glove was to cheer him up/make him laugh or something. I refused to discuss it any further but she decided to escalate by calling my mom who, unusually, sided with her and told me I was veing unreasonable and unfair towards my son.\n\nI just feel like I'm protecting my boundaries after being brushed off for so long, but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.\n\nYour ex's explanations, i.e. that he was playing with the kid or wanting to cheer him up or something, seem reasonable.

And you did this over a Facebook pic of your son enjoying a baseball game, the very one that you bailed on?\n\nYour story sounds made up.

My father was pissed, even though he was coaching the team and SD stayed in the stands.  \n\n\nMy brother was always torn.  As a result, it wasn't until after my brother grew up, had his own children, got divorced and had to deal with a SD for his 2 oldest sons...that's when he realized that my father had really cheated him by being so petty.    \n\n\nAs a result, when my nephews got a step-father...my brother encouraged them to love their SD.  My brother encouraged them to do things that they enjoyed (that my brother didn't) with their SD.

It\u2019s weird that you think that\u2019s happening here when there\u2019s zero implication that it is. If anyone is alienating OP, it\u2019s himself. He wasn\u2019t able to make his son\u2019s baseball game because he had a business trip abroad, but the moment he saw his ex wife\u2019s husband wearing the glove and got jealous he was able to cancel it and go home immediately to confront her about it in front of his son. What does that say to his son, that he\u2019s not important enough to cancel a business trip for but his father\u2019s ego is?", "Please reread the post and tell me where it says anything about child support. Because I don\u2019t see that. I see shared custody and OP buying small trinkets for his son.\n\nHaving a job that requires travel is OP\u2019s choice, not his ex\u2019s, so she is not responsible for how frequently he sees his son.\n\nDespite your efforts to slut shame the ex, she is MARRIED to ONE guy. Which is well within her rights as someone who is no longer married to OP.\n\nAnd all of that is irrelevant when you look at the comment you responded to: \u201cBe grateful that your son has a loving stepdad.\u201d Because it doesn\u2019t matter to the kid who is paying what or who is having sex with who. What matters is that stepdad is a net positive in his life.", "\"the guys she's screwing\"\n\nThat's a weird way to spell *husband*. Singular.", "Wow, your language. You sure have some issues. Yeah father could've left stuff at his place. But. No-one is alienating the son from him, based on his post, he is doing all that BY HIMSELF, with his actions. Hes too busy with work. Hes too busy traveling. He made a choice being THAT busy. He made choices that led to divorce. Now hes crying wolf, and tossing toys out of his pram because control, boundaries, people dont do what i demanded, blaaah.\n\nBased on your responses, you fit the profile too, of blaming others for your own shortcomings. Are you the OP? \n\nLook, hes not a present parent figure. That was his choice. I dont understand why he isnt putting his son first but is making THAT MUCH EFFORT to show up and yell at the mother who game birth to him, till his son cried. He is alienating his own son.", "No i didn\u2019t", "I HATE my stepkids mom. I think she's usurious and takes advantage of everyone, while giving nothing ... Even with her kids.\n\nAnd she still wouldn't flip about this.\nStep kids bring things back and forth all the time.", "They are now the child's belongings and not dad's so child can do as he wants with them including sharing with others", "\"I gave Sally a ball. I don't care if she wants to play ball, you can't touch the ball.\"\nIt's not actually reasonable.\nThe ball belongs to the kid. The kid decides who they play with.", "Or he could step up be a fucking dad and deal with his jealousy and insecurities", "OP: whines about shit that doesn't matter to his ex-wife who doesn't care\n\nstep-dad: takes his lovely family to a baseball game and has a great time with his stepson\n\nrandom commenters: this man is psychologically torturing OP", "I don\u2019t like liars, so I\u2019m just going to stop talking to you.. and then imagine pretending the gifts you buy someone just so happen to keep showing up in someone else\u2019s hands and thinking it\u2019s completely normal. Looney Tunes for sure.", "It\u2019s weird that you find it perfectly normal. That stepdad continues to get caught repeatedly using the items OP bought in pictures.. seriously how is that normal?\n\nIt happened one time might just be chance .. but for it to continue happening is either some weird ass coincidence or it\u2019s malicious", "This person is simply projecting their own issues onto this post. If you click on their profile you\u2019ll see a post talking about how their wife left them and took the kids. It\u2019s just projection and nothing more.", "right, i guess he should quit his job; but wait, he can't because he has to pay his dumbass ex 'child' support so her fuckbuddy can play with the toys the real dad is buying his kid.", "Maybe there\u2019s a reason OP holds such negative emotions towards step-dad, we don\u2019t know what it is. We don\u2019t know why they\u2019re divorced or if step dad was involved. Whatever reason he has for his boundaries, they should respect it instead of blatantly throwing it in his face", ">That stepdad continues to get caught repeatedly using the items OP bought in pictures\n\nSeriously??", "Because he\u2019s playing with the child that he lives with at least part of the time, and part of playing with children often involves putting on things they give you. They ask you to do it or you offer to hold it for them or any number of other reasons. That\u2019s how play often works. Have you ever spent more than 5 minutes with a child? I ended up wearing my cousins babies tiara an hour into a family wedding a few months ago and I\u2019ve been in her presence like 4 times in her life total. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your baggage is, but the idea that this has to be malicious is fucking weird and you should seek a counselor to talk it out.", "Yup. At least he\u2019s making OP look like slightly less of an asshole in contrast.", "Kindly, stop twisting extremes. No-one said he has to quit his job. He needs to juggle his commitments better. If he cant figure out how to make it work, thats his problem. And also yours for being so combative on the topic. I guess you really must be the OP with a massive chip on his shoulder. Get therapy. Its helpful for all that anger you have. You need to sort out your anger issues.", "yeah i'm sure OP made a whole post complaining about this guy and left out how he was his ex-wife's affair partner and tore apart their marriage, let's speculate about that without any textual basis whatsoever", "I honestly wish you would have to put your age and gender into your accounts.. because I\u2019m trying to figure out if it\u2019s the school system for why people deliberately ignore things.. or if it\u2019s a gender related bias issue..\n\nBecause there is a common theme that is becoming really prevalent in posts where men are the author.\n\nPeople assume the worst from the get go, and they leave out any information that might make their perspective, rational, or even justifiable.\n\nI know if I continued to catch a stepparent with the items I bought my son at some point it\u2019s going to annoy the shit out of you because you\u2019re going to start assuming they are taking these items in passing it off as their own.\n\nI do wonder, is he sending this in the mail?, Or is he giving it in person..\n\nWouldn\u2019t be the first story we\u2019ve read where a stepdad gets caught, taking things to make him look better", "It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s playing with the child! How does it get to the point where the same items he buys for his kid continue to be in the same picture?\n\nPeople don\u2019t normally take pictures while having things that aren\u2019t there\u2019s all the time .. they certainly don\u2019t just target the things the father buys. It\u2019s weird, especially if he\u2019s buying toys and things like that. \n\nI\u2019m sure you have a perfectly reasonable explanation for why he has a seven-year-olds shirt on too right?", "I checked his profile. Don\u2019t think he\u2019s OP, he\u2019s just bitter about his own divorce.", "So, based on my comment, what assumptions are you making about my age and gender?"]}
