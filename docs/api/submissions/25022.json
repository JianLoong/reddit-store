Her unstated requirement that YOUR money is her resource and you should budget to pay for her outings that don't even include you is absolutely crackers.\n\nThe lesson I'd take from this is that giving your sister money has resulted not in gratitude, but unpleasantness and a disregard for your privacy, safety and comfort in your relationship with her.

And then wave away anyone else's opinion. Because I would have already considered it and made a decision. Other people don't have a say in my financial decisions nor should they.\n\nI don't think I'm explaining why I asked OP that question well :(", "Well I assumed it sucked at least a little or OP wouldn't have made the post.

Make X decision for whatever reasons and to hell with what everyone else thinks. If so, I'm mostly the same way. But I married into a family where giving money to each other was more or less expected so I have learned that some people in families like that are just.... used to that kind of behavior? Where they're expected to do something and if they set a boundary about it they get guilted and gaslit about it", "I understand it the way you meant it, I think. Just it's a perspective issue. You're confident enough in yourself and your boundaries that it isn't an issue for you. That's a good thing. Some people aren't like that, is the thing. Whether it's how they were raised or just who they are, some people struggle with boundaries, especially when it's family, who they care about. Some family members take advantage of them, and twist it into a \"families help each other\" narrative no matter how frivolous or unreasonable the request, and let family pressure and guilt do the rest. OP is now in the unenviable stage where she's setting boundaries and the sister is pressing the guilt buttons to get the status quo back - read, her getting what she wants all the time. So it's helpful for OP to have the reassurance from people with no skin in this particular game, for the sake of perspective. In aid of that, NTA, OP. If your sister wants her outings and \"enjoying her youth\" so much, she should fund it herself, and she should be grateful for the money she's already had from you. You are not her backup wallet."]}
