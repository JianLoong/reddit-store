Designer bags and fake \u201cSex and the City\u201d-lifestyle?", "Considering she doesn't pay rent, that makes it even worse in my opinion. The entitlement is strong in the young woman.", "Some people are out on their own, with a spouse and a child of their own, but they haven't left behind their role--as doormat, clearly--in the family of origin. They still make decisions collaboratively with the parents, as a child would. \n\nClearly OP's instincts are good, but she hasn't yet learned to take ownership of her decisions.", "May I add that OP's sister and parents not talking to her are a gift. She should enjoy the silence.", "I was just talking about this with my husband and noting that I had lived apart from my parents since my late teens. As in hours and hours apart and even in different countries so that I learned to 'adult' on my own terms without them there to second guess or have their opinion about what I should do on a daily basis while my sibs didn't. Made for totally different dynamics with my parents for me and them.", "NTA your sister can pay for her own partying. Darn right you and your husband's mutual finances come first.", "NTA. No more lending", "NTA\n\nI have a rule that I can\u2019t help those who won\u2019t help themselves.\nYour sister is not helping herself by not curbing her own spending or taking responsibility or basically telling herself \u2018no\u2019.\n\nTherefore\u2026 you cannot help her. Sorry! No can do. \n\nYour husband on the other hand, lets face it, once you have a baby together your financial futures are tied, so you\u2019re actually helping yourself in a round about way. Plus I\u2019m sure your hubby will pay you back in a different way, as in most couples. \n\nTwo entirely different situations.\n\nCUT YOUR SISTER OFF! You are not helping her by helping her to avoid responsibility.", "NTA", "NTA. You sister is ridiculous, greedy and not to bright. What you do with your money is your business. And calling your husband the father of your child \u201csome people\u201d is beyond dumb. \n\nShe needs to stop eating off your baby\u2019s plate and grow up.\n\nGood for you telling your dad to fund his brat\u2019s young years.", "NTA\n\nExcuse me????    \n\nYour deadbeat sister is upset because you paid a ticket for your SPOUSE?????\n\nShe is a total and complete leech.\n\nDo NOT fall for her pathetic attempt at manipulating you.", "> I told him he could fund the dinners if he wanted\n\nAnd that's all the reply he warranted.\n\nNTA", "You can get into trouble if you didn\u2019t pay that bill. Your sister will be fine if she doesn\u2019t go out for a fancy dinner.", "NTA, and that line about your father's funding her dinners is very apropos.\n\nWhy should you do it if he won't?\n\nThe trouble with relatives asking for money when they don't actually need it is that if you comply even once they will assume they're entitled to an unlimited amount of it and will never stop asking even if you start turning them down.\n\nThen they run tattling to the flying monkeys and war breaks out.", "NTA. What is with these entitled people? Instead of being grateful for the times you've given her money, she chose to think of you as her personal bank. And how dare your father support that??\n\nYour sister isn't just TA, by the way - she's also an irrational one. As if sharing finances with your husband is the same as giving money to someone who doesn't need it, just so they can splurge on stuff. \n\nYou are owed serious apologies, from your sister and your father.", "NTA. How much more entitled is your sister to equate paying a fine for your husband to not giving her fun money? She\u2019s 24 not 4. You have a baby to care for and shouldn\u2019t be supporting her lifestyle. Sister should be leeching off your parents, not you. Shame on her and your parents for expecting you to.", "NTA. Sorry but I just don't understand the mentality of a grown ass adult with a job asking their sibling to fund a night out. Pay for your own shit.", "NTA. She is an adult. Tell her to fund her own life. If your dad doesn't  like it, he can fund it. (So basically what you told them!)", "NTA, and you definitely should pick and choose and it should never be her. Or, if you are in \"I'll help everybody\" mode - I also have some bills and could use a helping hand", "NTA and honestly you\u2019re a better person than me because my first comment when she said \u201cI was picking and choosing who was deserving of my money,\u201d would have been \u201che gives me sex what do you give me?\u201d", "How dare you pay your husbands ticket instead of giving her money to go drink the night away!  I suppose you're going to want to feed and clothe your baby now instead of helping her!  Sarcasm of course.  You're under no obligation to help her party her life away, you don't even need to explain why.  Your dad can fund her lifestyle if he wants, ignore the family, your husband IS who is important, not them.  NTAH.", "LMAO.\n\nWhat the hell did I just read?\n\nYour sister and father are both assholes.\n\nGood for you for having your priorities straight OP.\n\nNTA.", ">I texted her afterwards saying that mine and my husband's finances were a decision as a couple, and her dinners out were not something I wanted to fund. She hasn't responded, but my dad (M62) texted telling me {sic...} she just wanted to enjoy her young years. I told him he could fund the dinners if he wanted,\n\nThat there is the only answer.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister and your dad are loopy. Your response to your dad was brilliant! You and your husband's finances are none of your sister's business, and she is certainly not entitled to your money...ever.", "NTA.  Your sister isn\u2019t entitled to your money, even if you have enough to spare.  If she wants to go to clubs and rooftop bars, SHE needs to manage her finances to fund it.  She\u2019s an adult, time to start paying her own way.", "NTA. Some families are the type to hold grudges, so you just have bad luck there. If money has not solved a recurring problem, money is the wrong treatment.", "NTA. But why was your husband and sister going out without you? That\u2019s very odd. \nAnd yes a couples money is private between them, nothing to do with your sister!", "NTA. You should help your husband. You two are a team. You should NOT feel obligated to help your delusional leech of a sister.", "NTA. I mean, she\u2019s right. You are picking and choosing who you help. I assume you don\u2019t wander down the streets, handing out money to every person you meet? You pick and choose? Isn\u2019t that what any sane person would do?\n\nWhen you gave her money, it wasn\u2019t really that you were being \u201cnice.\u201d You were being taken advantage of by a spoiled, over-grown toddler. Taking money from your own household (including your husband) isn\u2019t actually nice at all.", "NTA and your dad can get fucked too lol he's probably the reason shes like this", "NTA", "NTA  \nIs your sister living with you? Doing joint finances? Sleeping with you? No? I'm gonna assume no. Then that Comparison is INSANE. You paid for something that was, functionally, a household expense. And even if it wasn't, even if it was a treat or something you bought him, that's still your HUSBAND and thus he's higher up the gift-giving/attention giving totem pole. \n\nYour parents may have heard a different version of the story than what actually happened. Or they may just be under the incorrect impression that you should provide for your sister, either in general or because she still lives with and mooches off of them regularily. Either way, it isn't actually your problem. Be happy with your hubby and let her be either not go out or learn to budget like the grown up she's legally been for *six years*", "Seriously, you're questioning if you're the arse?...definitely not. Your family are", "NTA\u2026she wants you to be her sugar daddy\u2026needs to learn to budget her money accordingly. Dad is one though, along with sister\u2026if he\u2019s so positive she should enjoy her young years he can fund it.", "NTA and stop enabling your sister. Healthy boundaries are important as it equal support in a health relationship. Trust is earned and she doesn\u2019t have yours in this regard. That\u2019s on her.", "Your parents expect you to fund your 24yo sister's happy hour? WTF?\n\nYou have a family and that's where your resources need to be allocated. Savings for vacation, education, treats for your family ... those are valid expenditures. Not sister's party lifestyle.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband have some form of joint finances, of course you're gonna pay his bill.\n\nYour sister needs to get that chip on her shoulder looked after.", "Gosh! That's so unfair! Your sister, who has so few expenses and responsibilities can't even get a hundred bucks to go out for dinner.  Meanwhile, your HUSBAND, who has a traffic ticket (which obviously must get paid...) gets the ticket paid! It's so unfair!  /s\n\nYour sister... is awfully entitled, isn't she? Was she spoiled as a kid? Sounds like it! NTA", ">my dad (M62) texted telling me I was being too hard on her and she just wanted to enjoy her young years. I told him he could fund the dinners if he wanted\n\nPERFECT response!  I hate when other people feel it is ok to spend your money for you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA unless you have a joint checking account with your sister... When you live with someone like that the bills are pretty much everyone's bills.", "NTA.\n\nThis blows my mind.  WHY do siblings think that another sibling should pay for them to go out, buy clothes, pay their rent, etc?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has a job.  Where does she get off, thinking that she should have equal access to your money as your HUSBAND?\n\nTrue narcisstic behavior.  And your Dad is equally biased and clueless.", "NTA, but let's turn the tables.\n\nSend a text to your dad and sister asking them each for $100 so you can buy your husband a great present or go on a girls night out.\n\nDon't just ask once - keep asking.  \n\nThen complain that it \"isn't fair\" if they don't want to spend their money treating you because \"you're a mom and deserve to have fun.\"", "NTA. But...you already know that, right? You're not a bank. She's not owed free money from you.

You are not financially responsible for your sister. I can\u2019t even imagine asking my sister for money unless it was a short term loan or for something serious like an emergency.", "NTA 100%", "Clearly nta. Your dad can fund your younger sister if he feels that way.", "This is the clearest case of NTA ever in this sub. \n\nWhy do you believe your sister and parents?", "This is not even that. This is a person taking care of their joint household responsibilities. It could have just as easily been food for her kid. The sister has no right to say anything about it, let alone play the victim for not being given a handout she\u2019s done nothing to deserve.", "OP should start asking her sister to buy her baby stuff."]}
