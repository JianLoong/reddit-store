I\u2019ll usually walk away from a fight because I know what happens when I fight and it isn\u2019t pretty. The anger builds up faster than I can release it. I get filled with rage and am prone to doing drastic things which I may not remember later. For instance, I was once assaulted in school. We got in a fight, which culminated in me hitting the other kid in the head with a cinderblock. I have zero recollection of doing that, or most of the fight. He was lucky to walk away from it.
