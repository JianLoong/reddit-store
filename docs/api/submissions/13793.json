The last time I saw my father in person was when I was either 15 or 16 and had visited him and his side of the family for a week in the summer. He had taken no part in raising me as he lived on other the other side of the country. He never visited. Never came to sports events and never called.\n\nThe first time I had seen him since I was probably 1/2 was when I was 11 the summer before going into middle school with my mom. When I had gotten there I had learned that had another little sister and 2 younger brothers (all about 5-7 years younger than me) who he was raising with my stepmom.\n\nAnd though it was nice meeting them and everyone on my father\u2019s side of the family(Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, Grandad) I had never really created a connection with anyone and no one had tried to stay in contact with me. The only person who had tried to somewhat stay in contact with me was my father\u2019s wife who would send me Happy Holiday and Happy Birthday texts every now and again. Though no sorts of texts would come from my Father who was given my cellphone number at the same time as my stepmom. My cellphone number has not changed since middle school to this day.\n\nBecause I did live on the other side of the country my mom did have my father on child support but it wouldn\u2019t have even been enough to survive on. We used it for competition fees in gymnastics. My mom has never spoken bad about my father but after endless years of no contact and empty promises from him I didn\u2019t want or feel the need to have a relationship with my him.\n\nSo to the actual AITA\u2026My father texted me out of the blue on my 22nd birthday \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. He had not sent me a text or called me since Christmas 2 years before that. He then asked me if I was doing well.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to respond after seeing it but during that time I thought it would be funny to send him a request on his Zelle, Cashapp and Venmo accounts that I found using his number saying \u201cFather Application Fee $2500\u201d. Then I sent him a text saying, \u201cplease pay the application fee to acquire a response from daughter\u201d. He sent me a flurry of texts telling me that I was disrespectful and we had gone back and forth before I decided to block him.\n\nRecently I was on the phone with my aunt (his sister) who I have begun connecting to have a relationship with. She had asked me when the last time I had spoken to my father. I relayed to story to her and instead of finding it funny she said that I had been an asshole.\n\nSo Reddit\u2026AITA?\n\nEDIT: My mom and father were in a relationship and had broken up due to him cheating when I was around 2. He decided to leave and move back to his home town on the other side of the country. My mom never stopped me from having contact with my father or his side of the family. Aunts and Uncles and even my older sister would sometimes send messages every few years or so. My Step-mom was more in the picture than my father as she would try to keep me in contact with my brothers", "created_utc": 1680410686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129aawk/aita_for_sending_my_father_a_father_application/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A father that cannot be present for his own child is not only not a father at all, but a shell of a man at best. You owe nothing to this man that hasn't done more than write a check to help cover the bills.

It\u2019s such a large amount of money that it is clearly a joke and not actual extortion. He should be a better sport about it and show some self awareness.", "NTA. The edit kind of confirms that daddy dearest here started a new family with his new wife after cheating on OP\u2019s mom, and it was just easier to ignore op. \n\nAlso I doubt mom stopped dad like op said. For one op has been an adult for a while now, which would give dad plenty of time to explain himself if mom was blocking him. But, probably more important is that he moved to the other side of the country when op was still really young. IDK what he was expecting from a literal child to keep in contact with him. \n\nIf that joke was enough to rile him up like that\u2026you probably dodged a bullet. If I were in OP\u2019s shoes I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d care to keep in contact with dad here much either tbh. \n\nYou cannot shamelessly ignore someone with the exception of once in a blue moon for 22 years and expect them to welcome you with open arms.", "NTA. That\u2019s actually hilarious. You were obviously joking. He\u2019s a deadbeat. Kick him to the curb", "NTA that's a cheaper cost than he owes for 16 years worth of no child support + help with college", "You're my hero", "I see two very real scenarios in front of me here:\n\nIn one, he had nothing to do with you because your mother didn't allow him or his family contact with you- not only does it happen in some cases, but that's quite literally what happened to me (which does make me biased towards believing this scenario)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other is that he's just a fully deadbeat dad who only started cleaning up his act for his 'new' family and reached out because of that. Absolutely possible, happens literally all the time. Happened to my half brother. Happened to half of my cousins. Etc.\n\nIn the first scenario, while it was hurtful, I'd say no one is at fault because you didn't know, and he was genuinely reaching out.\n\nIn the second, sure it was hurtful, but he has zero right to call himself your dad when he never stepped up to the plate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour aunt is obviously inclined to think you're a jerk regardless, since she's essentially known him longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless of the situation, NTA- but the first scenario would definitely be a no assholes vote from me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think the first scenario is possible and want to learn more, I'd recommend asking your father's family why they never reached out, or mentioning that you grew up feeling isolated from them. But it's your life, and you're also 100% okay if you never decide to explore those feelings or possibilities, either bc they're unlikely, or some other reason.\n\nTake care, and I hope your aunt can see where you were coming from and forgive you. Best of luck out there <3", "NTA. It was a joke and he got butt hurt over it. I think it took a lot of courage for him to reach out and I think he was expecting an appreciation text from you which you don\u2019t owe him at all. The man was never there.", "NTA. The fact that he took it seriously means he knows he screwed up. Im just curious why he chose to reach out then instead of any other time? I assume to ask for something.", "ESH\n\nHe should have been present for you, but he wasn\u2019t. Raising another family and forgetting you exist isn\u2019t right. That\u2019s a dick move. \n\nHowever, he\u2019s nearly a stranger to you. Not knowing his sense of humor or how he would take it, you decided to use his moment of trying to connect with you as a prank to rub your resentment in his face for his absence. That\u2019s a dick move too and kind of chicken, if you ask me. You didn\u2019t have the \ud83e\udd5a\ud83e\udd5ato tell him how his text made you feel, so you did something incredibly passive aggressive and I think you knew it was hurtful. \n\nThe non-dick move would have been for you to text him back and say, \u201cWhile I appreciate that you\u2019re reaching out, I have to admit that it sucks that you choose to do it so randomly. I don\u2019t feel very important to you. I was even tempted to jokingly send you an application with a fee to get a response from me because it feels like you\u2019re a stranger to me. If you want to talk about that, I\u2019m open to it. But these random texts just serve to make me continue to feel like someone you only occasionally remember exists and that doesn\u2019t feel very good.\u201d", "ESH. Maybe he was trying to turn things around? I\u2019m not excusing him for his past behavior but he needs to start somewhere. He reached out - it was a start. I\u2019m betting he won\u2019t try again.", "ESH He failed as a father but your vindictive message shows your character as well. Especially the asking for money part. You could have taken the high road or just ignored him, but I guess you chose a different route. You're saying it was a joke, what exactly is funny about it?", "Yes, YTA.  If you want to continue not having a relationship with him, that's certainly your right.  Telling your father, or anyone for that matter, that they have to pay for the privilege of interacting with you is assholery.", "YTA - I don't blame you though. There was no way for him to know it was sarcasm (assuming it was - if not, you are an even bigger AH). Just because someone is your blood relation does not mean that you are required to have a relationship with him/her. Question: When was the last time you texted your dad \"Happy Birthday\"? Do you ever acknowledge it?", "NTA\u2026. Ish.   \nI think you need to find out WHY he hasn\u2019t had contact with you\u2026 from your Aunt. Because she has his side of things\u2026 which could be wildly different from your mother\u2019s. But also he might have painted a specific picture to her that isn\u2019t truthful too.   \nFor him to contact you out of the blue on your birthday and then not have a serious conversation with you\u2026 isn\u2019t great form. He should have texted and asked to chat. If the text was only \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d then I can see your annoyance for sure.", "YTA", "YTA.  It's unfortunate that people who are not compatible at all end up reproducing so frequently.  But the bottom line is that your mother chose to bring you into this world, knowing that you would have little or no contact with your father.

But even so..sex happens.  Pregnancy happens.  Because he couldn't make it work with your mom, he did you a favor by disappearing.  Otherwise, you would have been raised by parents who hate each other, which would scar you (mentally) for life.\n\nIt takes great courage for him to reach out to you after all these years.
