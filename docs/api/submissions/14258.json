{"id": 14258, "submission_id": "12exzot", "title": "WIBTA if I don't help my sister take care of my mother", "selftext": "10y ago my sister (44F) chose to leave her career and move in with my  mother, who suffers from dementia. Now, mom\u2019s disease has progressed  until she cannot remember things from one moment to the next, cannot  control her bladder or bowels, cannot remember how to bathe or dress,  and can be highly combative, not unlike a very stubborn adult-sized  toddler. Her type of dementia also gives her hallucinations and sleep  disturbances, making her care a 24/7 requirement. My sister attempts to  manage mom\u2019s care all on her own, and this has seriously impacted her  own health.\n\nI (48F) live three hours away with my partner, and am disabled,  having both physical and emotional issues. I have spoken with my sister  multiple times about placing mom in a memory care facility, which would  take on mom\u2019s care in three shifts by multiple people, ultimately giving  her better care overall. However, my sister has resisted this idea  vehemently, and, since she has POA on my mother, the final say is hers.  The reasons behind her resistance are partially emotional, in that she  claims to still, occasionally, see glimpses of our mom once in a while  and doesn\u2019t want to give those up. The other part of her resistance is  financial. She lives in my mother\u2019s house, with my mother\u2019s income  paying all of the bills and providing her with spending money. That  income, and likely the house, would be forfeit to pay for my mother\u2019s  long-term care, meaning that she would have to scramble to find work and  a place to live.\n\nOn to the problem.\n\nMy sister has a boyfriend that she rarely gets to spend time with.  She has asked me to come to mom\u2019s house to take care of mom while she  and her boyfriend take a short vacation. I totally understand her need  for time away, as she is totally exhausted and the situation is  overwhelming. However, while she is willing to put a band-aid on the  issue by taking some time away and asking for me to give her relief, she  is unwilling to address the long-term problem by moving toward a more  permanent solution. In addition, my distance and physical disabilities  make caring for my mother extremely difficult for me. I am unwilling to  help her in the short term if she is unwilling to consider finding a  real solution. If I agree to help her now, she will continue to come to  me to give short-term fixes, without addressing the bigger issue.\n\nSo\u2026 WIBTA if I tell my sister that I will not be able to help her with my mom when she refuses to work on a real solution?\n\nEDIT 1: Some have suggested getting a caretaker. I like this option, but the money just isn't there. My sister has suggested that instead of coming to take care of mom, that I simply give her the cash to pay for a 24/7 caretaker for the length of her vacation, to an estimated amount of $2500. I don't have it. My sister doesn't have it. Regular insurance does not cover it because my mother's income is considered too high. Similarly, respite care and in-home visits by assistants are not covered.\n\nEDIT 2: People have asked whether my physical disabilities interfere with my ability to help. I have a chronic condition that causes a great deal of pain. While I can physically do the work of caring for mom, the resulting flare in my condition means I will spend at least a week to 10 days afterwards in severe pain and unable to do ordinary activities.", "created_utc": 1680898853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12exzot/wibta_if_i_dont_help_my_sister_take_care_of_my/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't suddenly complain now that she has to deal with the problems that decision brings with it. And you being disabled makes her request even more absurd. If she wants to have the freedom to see her guy when she wants, she can get a job, get her own place, and her your mom into a care facility. It's not fair for her to rope you into the responsibility for her own choices.", "NTA\n\nThere comes a time where being sentimental is a detriment. Your mother is definitely to the point that she needs professional care 24/7. Your sister tried to do it alone and can't. The two of you can do more together but still not to the degree that your mother needs. There are legal things you can do to force the issue but I guarantee y'all won't have the same level relationship ever again. \n\nJust bring it to her that your mother deserves the care she needs, and her selfishly denying your mother this care for her own sentimental reasons only hurts everyone involved.", "I worked hospice. It is not unheard of for family to care for dementia patients in the home till the end. She can look into hiring helpers during the day. If she qualifies for hospice, she can get something called respite care. \nDementia is not only hard on the patient but also the families. Memory care facilities can run up to 4 grand or more. Sometimes ones they go into the facilities they tend to progress quickly depending on how far the disease has progressed.", "NTA. With your conditions, you probably would not be a safe carer for your mother anyway. And, by providing your sister with a band-aid for the situation would only draw out the pain. It is tough, but sis is going to get herself a job and a roof over her own head. I can't help thinking that it will be better for her in the long run. I am sure it will be better for your mother.", "Info: would your own health issues prevent you from giving your mum the care she needs for a week?\n\nIf so, then NTA. \n\nIf not, then YWBTA, but gently. I understand your point, but let your sister have a damn break. The week of rest might be enough to make your sister realise that she is damaging her own life by not making more suitable arrangements for your mum. Last day of vacation might either be a massive case of \"Sunday night blues\" or might be \"wow this wasn't enough time\". \nBe clear before the vacation that this is a one time deal and that you will work together to find a more sustainable resolution going forward. Maybe it could be some home help for a while to get your mum and sister used to the idea of some outside assistance.", "NTA, but have you considered if your mothers health is on the decline why not take an opportunity to go be with her and in doing so giving you sister a much needed break. If it starts to become a habit then that\u2019s a different story but for now go be with your mother the best way you can before she leaves this earth.\n\nP.s while it may seem like on the surface your sister is using your mothers funds to support herself don\u2019t forget what you also said about this kind of care for your mother being 24/7. Personally I\u2019d take a 9-5 job with the rest of the time for myself but by her always being \u201con call\u201d for your mothers needs I\u2019d say it\u2019s more than fair to have her room and board taken care of in return.", "NAH- no one is in the wrong here. My grandmother has dementia and she lives with my family right now. While hers has no progressed as far as your mom\u2019s it\u2019s a lot to take on. We have a home care worker who comes in to help while we are at work. Maybe have someone come in to handle the care while she takes her vacation, or maybe have them come in part time to help her out. Moving your mom to a facility is legally your sisters decision, but if you can\u2019t help by being there, you can help by hiring someone to help her.", "NTA? Because I get it, it is just a bandaid. But look into other options. Where I live there's something called respite care. It's a place - I've only seen houses with 4-5 bedrooms, but im sure there's other facilities - they're a place for people to go short-term to give their caregivers that much needed break. I've seen quite a few where clients stayed for 2-3 wks, some for longer. Maybe you can find something similar?", "NTA. She's POA which covers financial but not medical. POA is fiduciary and supposed to act in your mother's best interest. She isn't. She's acting in her best interest.\n\nThere are also respite care organizations that should be able to help her", "NTA. You are trying to get your sister to see reason. Neither of you are capable of giving your mother the care she needs at this point in time.  Mom needs to be in a care facility, not having her middle aged daughters abandoning their own lives to provide inexpert care for her.", "NTA My grandmother suffered from dementia for over a decade before she passed. My grandfather and other relatives decided that the best thing for her was to remain at home. That worked, for a while. She got worse and worse and I was glad for her sake when she passed, so she didn't have to suffer anymore. Keeping her at home was the most selfish thing they could have done, if she had received proper care her last years would have been more peaceful.\n\nThis is an emotional subject because no one wants to \"dump\" their loved one somewhere when they get ill. It's not about feelings or guilt though, all that matters is that the person with dementia gets the best care they can and get to live the best life they can. And when they're no longer \"there\" they deserve to be in a place they feel familiar and safe in, which is why it's important to find a place in good time so that they can get used to it.  \n\nYour sister is not seeing clearly. I don't doubt that she loves your mom and has caregiver burnout, but this is self inflicted.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has actually helped with caring for someone with dementia (my mom) and isn't just considering this in theory, I can tell you that caretaking is not for everyone and there is - or *should* be - NO shame on acknowledging that you are not cut out for (nor truly able) to do this work. \n\nI'm curious how many Y T A commenters have actual caretaking experience, because it's fucking hard, and your sister is asking something I would consider absolutely fucking unreasonable. Spending just a *long weekend* as my mom's sole caretaker took it out of me (I also have chronic illnesses that flare up painfully), and my mom was at the time still fairly easy to handle. \n\nYour sister, honestly, is probably unable to give your mother the care she now needs. That's her choice to make since she has POA, but it doesn't mean it's a good choice. \n\nAn incredibly important part of caregiving is understanding your limits, and it sounds like she's going well beyond hers.   Now she's asking you to suffer for her choices, to disregard your own limitations and boundaries, and that makes her the asshole here.", "NTA, you are totally entitled to set your own boundaries about what you can't and don't want to do for your mother's care.  Whilst I do not envy your sister at all and she has an impossibly difficult job, at the end of the day she chose it, and that doesn't force you to choose it too.\n\nI think your idea sounds perfectly sensible and you've explained it well - your sister is looking for a quick fix for a problem that she needs to think about longer term.  Maybe she feels guilty and doesn't want to face that reality, so you can definitely help her there with some supportive chats, but it's fine for you to not agree to help physically.", "NTA, It sounds like your mother has deteriorated beyond a level that can be taken care of by family. She needs to be taken care of by professionals. It may feel to your sister as \"abandoning\" her but that is not the case, mom needs to be with people who have learned to take care of people with this kind of condition. It would be a disservice to mom to witheld her the care she needs. It may be hard to force your sister to face reality, but you have no real choice.", "YTA (present tense, no conditional about it). Your sister has given up her career, deprioritised her BF and for 10 years given your mother round-the-clock care that allows her to stay in her own home - and you're making it sound like a get-rich-quick scam. This is your mother too and you need to help her out for just two weeks.", "Whether or not YWBTA really depends on how much of your refusal is based on your disabilities, instead of how much is because you don't agree with her choices. If you truly are unable to, that is understandable. But you seem to go back and forth on that and imply that you would be willing to do it if she was considering a longer term solution. If that is the case, I think it would be a nice thing to do for your sister to help her out for her short trip, so that she can get some relief. You may not be \"obligated\" to do it, but given that your sister does bear the difficulty of being a caregiver for your mother, and she is not asking for long term involvement from you, than giving her this relief would be something you could do. \n\nI am particularly sensitive to this because my MIL was the long term caregiver for her father for almost a decade. The situation was a bit different as where we live, and their finances, didn't allow for good long term home care. But I always felt resentment towards my MIL's two sisters for not doing their part, especially the financially well off one, to help with the care of her father. \n\nSo of course, that story has several pieces that aren't analogous to your situation, but as someone who watched a family member struggle with being a long term care provider, it would've meant a lot for someone to step in to help even for a few days so she could get a break.", "NTA If you are in the US Medicare will pay for in home sitters and will also pay your sister for being her caretaker. I think it's an either or thing I don't think you can get both.", "NTA. We (65f and hubby 68m) moved my mom in with us due to dementia and other health issues. I have 2 sisters (63 and 60). They provided help when they could but the vast majority fell on me. After about 2 years they insisted it was time to move mom into memory care. We were lucky as she had a long term care policy and money is not an issue. I did not know until she was moved how very much of a toll her care was taking on me.\nGo care for your mom. It will give you a much better understanding of what is really going on. Allowing your sister to step away will also give her some perspective on how hard this is on her. When she gets back you can have a much more informed conversation about the path forward.", "Frankly, the real issue that needs fixing is financial. Your sister\u2019s security is your mom\u2019s income. That\u2019s the problem you need to solve.", "NTA", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
