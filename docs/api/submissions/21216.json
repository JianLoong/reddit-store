Mine was born 11 days after.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re her partner and she\u2019s going to physically hurting, permanently exhausted and more importantly she\u2019s asking you to stay because she knows she\u2019ll need your help and support.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a few months after, it\u2019s 14 days and if she becomes overdue then you can reduce that time.\n\nImagine pushing a watermelon through your dick and then having to use your body to feed it whilst still in agony. Would you be okay with your partner leaving you?", ">wedding that has been planned for over a year.\n\nThen you should have thought about it before impregnating your gf.\n\nNow that your gf has clearly stated her wish, you should stay back n help her. YTA", "YTA. That's too far to go and too soon after she has given birth and that's if she gives birth on her due date. I know women who have had the baby a week past their due date.", "YTA, majorly. That you\u2019re even considering this tells me you\u2019ve done shockingly little research in preparation for this baby and either haven\u2019t been attending prenatal visits or paying attention if you have.\n\nFirst of all, babies aren\u2019t born on the exact due date. There\u2019s a decent chance the baby will have been *just* born by February 14th. And even if the baby does come on time, your girlfriend\u2019s body will be in recovery. She and baby may still be in the hospital. If she has a c section she would be recovering from major surgery while caring for a newborn. It\u2019s also a crucial time for bonding, which as the baby\u2019s father you should care about.\n\nGet it together and start thinking like a father, because you are very far off from that point right now.", "YTA. You need to graciously decline your wedding party spot and get ready for being a father. Start reading parenting boards, practice with friends babies, watch YouTube videos. Be as prepared for baby as you can. The first weeks home with a newborn is actual insanity. There is a new human living in your house that you barely know, there\u2019s poop, pee, vomit and potentially blood everywhere. Time does not exist. Her nipples may be raw and blistered. When she tries to poop, it may feel like \u201cshe\u2019s pooping out a strand of razor wire that is kinda stuck\u201d (true story). \n\nYour gf will need your support 100%. Also, you will want to be next to your baby and gf the entire time. Having a newborn is like a piece of your heart is outside your body and is laying on your chest. You would be miserable at a wedding separated from your baby anyway, trust me.", "You\u2019re not supposed to \u201csupport\u201d your gf in being a parent. You are supposed to be one too.

I really hope over the coming months you realise what a big deal this is for both you and your girlfriend and please give her the emotional and physical support she needs. \n\nGrowing and birthing a child is no joke and you need to respect that or your relationship is about to take a nosedive.", "YTA. I get that it's a tough spot for you but your exhausted partner and your newborn child are the bigger priority.", "Gentle YTA, because this sounds like it's your first rodeo.\n\nI would back out of being a groomsman now because you can't predict the future, and babies are a wild ride. This not only puts your GF first, but it also helps out your friend getting married because it's one less variable they have to plan for.\n\nThings that can go awry:\n\n1. Baby is early, and is still in the NICU when the wedding rolls around. \n2. Baby is late, and your SO isn't two weeks post-partum, but *days*. \n3. A difficult delivery leads to your SO needing more help than expected. \n4. Something happens, and her mom can't make it. THIS HAPPENS A LOT.  Medical emergencies, money issues, work crap, houses flooding, all of that can pile on at the worst time.\n5. Mom shows up, and is useless. THIS HAPPENS EVEN MORE. Your SO would be tending to a new baby AND a pesky guest at the same time.\n\nAlso, like... trust me, my dude, you want to NAIL that first Valentine's day after a baby is born. She'll be feeling at her lowest, physically, and wondering if she's even lovable anymore. Shower her in whatever she loves.", "YTA.  She's due late January....and baby might come a week later,  or come early and need extra care.\n\nDoesn't matter if her mom is there,  she wants you there. \n\nIf the wedding was in town, I'd  say NTA.   But a 4 hour flight and gone for 3 days..nope", "YTA too soon, too far, too long", "YTA. You\u2019re talking of leaving your girlfriend with a newborn less than 20 days after birth. You don\u2019t even know what condition she will be in. What if she has to get a c-section? Even if it\u2019s a vaginal birth, she\u2019ll need to take it easy a couple of months (at least). You\u2019re planning to leave her with the whole burden of caring for a newborn, not to mention cleaning, cooking and other domestic tasks, just to attend a wedding (doesn\u2019t matter whose it is).\n\nYour priority needs to be your family, not a wedding. Hope you take the right call.", "You should definitely stay with your girlfriend in my opinion. When she said she needed support, she wasn't lying.", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA\n\n\nYour partner will be pushing out a CHILD, and you want to leave her 2 weeks after?\n\n\nThat\u2019s even if baby is on time, my baby was 16 days late. \n\nYou also have the chances of C Sections, which means she won\u2019t be able to lift much for 4-8 weeks (dependant on healing) \n\nAnd!!! It\u2019s your freaking kid! And you just wanna leave basically straight after they are born??", "YTA. Your baby most likely isn\u2019t going to come on the due date. In fact, a lot of first babies are overdue and labor is long. My first kid I pushed for two hours, ended up with an episiotomy and a really bad tear. The words \u201crepair anal sphincter\u201d are written in my medical chart. \n\nThat shit hurt and took weeks to recover. I couldn\u2019t stand completely upright or walk normally for a good two months. I cried every time I had to poop. Then there was the actual newborn human I was now responsible for. Thankfully I had my husband with me.\n\nYou have a responsibility to this woman and this baby. They need to come first. Tell your friend it\u2019s too close to the due date. Support him in other ways.", "My child was born 14days late and had to be induced and it was agonising 48h labour. So.. yta and I know it's not your fault re timings, but come on.", "Sorry bud, but brand new baby is more important than wedding. You need to be there to bond, help, and be a part of the chaos that is so important. Your lady and baby need to know they can lean on you, not just grandma. Babies change priorities, and it's time to update yours. YTA", "Father of two here, you would absolutely be YTA\n\nYour family takes precedence over friends now, and a two week old with a healing mother at home will need you there.", "Yta, you want to bring home so many germs from a plan trip to your newborn baby. \n\nPlus only possible two week postpartum. The second week was worse than the first. Plus you don\u2019t know how your baby will be.", "YTA.\n\nIf you are dumb enough to go, it will cause resentment that wont be going away anytime soon.\n\nMuch too far away, for way too long and too soon after the theoretical due date, you may even miss the birth.\n\nThis is the kind of decision that, if you make the wrong choice, you will regret forever.", "INFO: Is she going away for three days after your trip, while you watch the baby?", "YTA \n\nYour baby may not even be a week old if your GF\u2019s pregnancy goes over her due date.

You need to be home to take the baby while your GF takes care of her own basic needs. \n\nLong story short - You don\u2019t plan non essential shit for at least 6 weeks post due date and even then you\u2019re on thin ice if it isn\u2019t local.", "YTA. \n1. Babies often come two weeks late especially if they\u2019re the first. \n2. I think you\u2019re underestimating how scary and incredible that first period is, every tiny little thing they do has you googling and panicking, you need each other, you need support. (I am assuming because you\u2019re asking this question in the first place that you\u2019re a first time parent). \n3. Recovery is very tough regardless of what kind of birth you have, both mentally and physically. The question you should be asking is how can I best support my partner.", "YTA. 2 weeks after birth is NOT the time to leave your new family for 4 days being 4 hr plane trip away. Frankly yta for even considering going. If your friend is reasonable he'll understand.", "YTA. And your friend should understand why you can\u2019t be there.", "YTA\n\nUnfortunately, that's the realism of having a child. Any plans need too change to prioritize this.", "It really depends on what your gf is comfortable with. In this case it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want you to go, so yes, YTA. \n\nI agree with others that it sounds like you might not understand what you\u2019re getting into. Unless she has a scheduled C section, births don\u2019t actually happen on the due date necessarily. They can be anytime from 37-42 weeks and the due date marks the 40th week. Most first births are late. \n\nI think the best thing to do is to talk to your friend and make sure he knows everything is uncertain and that you may not be about to make it. If the baby comes early and your wife is totally settled in, maybe she will be ok with it, but until both of you know what it looks like do not commit to being out of town. \n\nAlso, I know it\u2019s your friend, but don\u2019t you want to spend some time with your new baby?! You and your gf have literally created life. Take the time to enjoy and appreciate the beautiful gift you\u2019ve been given!", "Def YTA for not doing your homework on pregnancy and giving birth. Her due date is end of janauary which means 40 weeks. Most women don't give birth on their due date. It can easily happen that she gives birth a week or even 2 weeks later which would mean that you would leave her alone with a new born of maybe couple of days old. I'm also very suprised that you would even want't leave your max 2 weeks old baby just to be able to go to some wedding. I think you are very much underestimating the whole situation.", "YTA- focus on your family over your friends at a time like this", "YWBTA\n\nThe birth of your child is a major milestone in the life of your family. Still, you think your friend is more important. That tells your wife all she needs to know.\n\nAre you really needed there for 3 days? Can't you just do the whole thing in 1 day?", "YTA. Some new mothers would be okay with this and that's their choice. Your GF is clearly not okay with this. She is telling you what she needs and you're ignoring her. You're showing her what kind of parent you are going to be.\n\nAlso, if you knew this wedding was happening before the pregnancy, you should have been able to plan around it and take precautions unless this was a very flukey oops.", "YTA. Your best route through is to bow out now of being a groomsman, and do that before consulting your GF to show her you have understood her a little. You could ask her if you could keep in reserve the option to *possibly* fly out on the day of and back the day after the wedding (2 days) - and only do that depending on how she and your baby are doing.", "YTA....you shouldnt go and leave her alone. The first trimester you shouldnt leave her side. Anything can go wrong and she needs you there. For example... in my labout the doctor put the epidural wrong and i wasnt able to walk for a month. I needed my husband home just to bring me food and help me to move around the house, changing diapers, etc. Also is a time were the baby might need to go to the hospital for something. They are really small and delicate. Stay with her", "Let me put it this way if you do go and come back to all the locks changed or your gf has gone back to her parents don\u2019t post here because we will all just laugh. To be clear YTA", "Easy. YTA.", "YTA my dad\u2019s best man was at my parents wedding while his wife was giving birth to their first child.", "YTA\n\nYou're hoping your baby comes on its due date, they may decide they want to bake a bit longer and is only a few days old.  Even if they do come on their due date you don't know how the birth is going to affect your gf, what if she has to have a C-section??\n\nYou're being incredibly selfish.", "YTA but I don\u2019t think you need to not go if circumstances allow. Pull out of being groomsman. The reality is birth can go wrong. Let\u2019s say the baby is 2 weeks late and then has an infection or your wife has a tough emergency c section. Then id say you definitely can\u2019t go. If baby arrives 2 weeks early and glides out in a beautiful candle filled water birth then I think you could probably disappear for a 1 or 2 night trip to the wedding esp if her mum is living with you. The reality is your friend will have to accept you want to come but you can\u2019t make that decision until the baby actually arrives as the dates are too close. Offer to pay for your place if it turns out you can\u2019t go last minute. But pull out of any duties now so you aren\u2019t going to be letting him down", "YWBTA", "YTA. My husband and I were invited to his friends wedding that was 2 weeks after my due date. In a nearby town. My husband immediately sent in the \"no\" rsvp because he knew life would be crazy and didn't want to leave me and the baby to go himself.\n\nYou will quickly realize that a newborn = extreme sleep deprivation, doctors appointments, near constant baby holding, and caring for the mother who is recovering physically from birth and continuously bleeding. And of course you still need to eat and do chores.\n\nBetter to bow out now, then to do it at the last minute (because you will NOT be going).", "There\u2019s no way of knowing whether or not it\u2019s reasonable to go to the wedding. Most likely it\u2019s not, but it all depends on when and how your kid will be born and how fast your girlfriend will recover. You realize that your child might come a few days before the wedding or even on the day of the wedding and that your girlfriend might still be in a horrible state around the time of the wedding. I also think it\u2019s a bit weird to want to leave your newborn for three whole days right after his or her birth, even if everything went perfect. YTA", "YTA. The baby can be early or late by a couple weeks. My first came 3 weeks eatly, my second 2 weeks late. Birth rips your body apart and takes time to recover. Your gf may need a c-section and will need a lot of help for months just doing basic things. You both will be really tired while you adjust to baby's schedule. You'll need to take turns feeding (if bottle fed), changing and caring for baby so you both don't turn into zombies.\n\nA word of caution - my husband took a trip 3 months in after our first was born. I got sick that week and spent the whole week exhausted while he was gone enjoying a beach. I felt so betrayed and even now years later I am still upset with him when I think about it. It could have ended our marriage. \n\nChoose your priorities wisely.", "YTA. Two weeks after giving birth you should not leave your girlfriend alone with the baby for a few days. What if the baby is born after it's due date? What if your gf needs a c section? She won't be able to care for the baby. What if it is a delivery with complications? There will also be hormonal changes which can take it's toll on your gf. Giving birth of tough, having a newborn and recovering is also very tough. Please cancel the wedding and be there for your daughter/son and your gf!!", "YTA \n\nThe first couple of weeks are incredibly difficult\n\nIs there a compromise where you can be gone for less time?", "YWBTA.\nNewborns are a lot. It's easy to think that you'll all be pretty settled after 2 weeks and your partner will be fine. But that's not taking into consideration sleep deprivation, cluster feeding and the ongoing healing she will be going through, c-section or not, and the potential for PPD and PPA.\n\nYour partner and child should come first. There are just some things you rely on your partner to help with and not your mother with a newborn. Your GF has also asked for your help and been upfront with you. She will need your support.", "YTA\n\nLook I get that your best friends wedding is very important and if the wedding was further away from the due date my vote would be different, but here is the thing...\n\nYou agree to make sacrifices the moment you decide to become parents and guess what, these sacrifices are never easy, it is really hard and upsetting to let go of things you really want or love but that is what you have to do. Your partner has already sacrificed so much just to carry and birth the baby, their social life, diet, body and emotional/psychological state have all had to change. Then she has to go through a stressful, painful and very emotional medical procedure and then bounce back enough to care for the new baby. And she needs your support. \n\nNow you have to make the sacrifice and miss your friends wedding so you can be a partner and a father. If you insist on going it will show her that your friends wedding is more important to you than making sure she and your new born child are getting the support, love and care they need, even after she specifically told you she needed you, and I am sure that is not what you want. \n\nSorry OP but this is parenthood, your life has changed and you wont always get to do the things you want.", "YTA. \n\nShe might not even have given birth by then. It's completely normal for babies to be born even 2 weeks after the due date so you might risk missing the birth of your child. \n\nAlso your girlfriend might be in rough shape after the delivery and not be able to take care of the baby at all without your help. For me that was the case even over a week after delivery since I had a rough complication and was so much in pain that I just slept all day medicated. \n\nEven without any complications, your girlfriend will be in pain, bleeding, weak and hormonal for weeks after delivery - in desperate need of your support in more ways than just one.\n\nDon't start your fatherhood like this. You'll regret it. I would have never forgiven my husband if he had ditched me like that when I needed him the most.", "YTA", "YTA.  You are assuming the baby will be born on it's due date.  A lot of my friends went 2 weeks overdue with their babies and had to be induced.  So you really shouldn't be planning to go anywhere around your gf's due date.", "Just shear her before you leave", "YWBTA. Don't go to the wedding and start to Work on an alternative plan on how you can support your BF so you can be there in spirit.", "YTA!! What on a EARTH did I just read?! Way to set a precedent. This is a joke, right?", "YTA\n\nLet me ask you a question - who are you going to be spending more time with over the rest of your life? Your girlfriend or best mate? Prioritize accordingly. \n\nAnd, birthing a baby can go spectacularly sideways before, during, and after. You need to be there. You're partially responsible for the situation, so own it and make sure it goes smoothly. \n\nIf your best mate is so important to you, and such a short flight away, make arrangements to visit them well before the due date. If your girlfriend is important to you, make arrangements to be there and show her you can be counted on.", "Wtaf. Hard YTA.\n\nLet me guess you're going to be one of those dad's that babysit their own kids rather than actually parenting them.\n\nI think your girlfriend needs to GFTO because you are clearly not prepared to actually be a partner or parent. What kind of asinine question are you asking. You're the AH every single day of the week for even thinking this was an acceptable thing to think about doing.", "YTA", "YTA - Everything has been already said. Time to grow up!", "YTA and I'm going to point out a different aspect of why: germs. A two week old can be put in critical condition with a common cold/RSV. You want to go to an airport, an airplane, go to a large gathering with people with who knows what germs, an airplane, the airport again, plus what ever else you come in contact with then bring it home to a baby with no immune system and your gf who's immune system is going to be compromised from blood loss and healing? \n\nHow are you going to feel if the baby ends up in the hospital because you brought home a cold? Let alone anything worse?", "YTA", "YWBTA but probably because you have no clue what hell life with a newborn can be. Please don\u2019t be a d!ck. She will need you like you wouldn\u2019t believe. You\u2019ll only understand from day 2 of the baby\u2019s arrival!", "YTA. Ignoring all of the adults you're prioritising over your newborn, your newborn won't even have a blood brain barrier.

Factor into that that due dates are mere estimates and are usually way off (or can go way off) for a plethora of reasons, and yeah...\n\nYour family needs to come first, especially during that time. I can guarantee that nothing helps your partner more than you; I had all the support I could dream of (both medical and otherwise) after both my children were born, but nothing compared to my husband stepping up and making life as easy as he could for me.

All of our arrangements were made assuming the best scenario, but could be revised based on the needs that arose at the time. Luckily, I had very easy pregnancies, but it's still hard. We didn't commit to anything in advance during the first 3 months of our babies' life. We were always tentative, assuming on the \"not\" going, but if we were feeling up for it, we might attend (if that worked for whoever hosted the event, of course. If it didn't, we just didn't go).\n\nSo I advise you to tell your friend you cannot be part of his bridal party due to his wedding being so close to the due date of your first child being born. Ask him if it would be OK if you attend as a guest with a last-minute decision on your attendance if, at that time, you and your partner *both* decide that it would be OK for you to go (don't put any pressure on her, please.
