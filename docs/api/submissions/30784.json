She said \"Make sure he has a nice suit so we can pretend you're marrying a successful man.\" Then she started laughing hysterically at her own joke. \n\nI said \"If you don't like who I'm actually marrying, don't come!\"\n\nThen her mood suddenly changed and she yelled at me \"That's no way to talk to your mother!\"\n\nI ran out in tears and then I thought a lot about how my mom has talked about my fiance.
