You have no idea what kind of damage this has done to OP over the years, and you don't know how she'll feel in the long-run if she does start standing up to her mom like this more often. Is it possible she'll always be upset over it? Yeah, of course, but then, it's also possible that she'll find some relief. \n\nAlso, OP hasn't said anything about cutting her mom out, just uninviting her from the wedding. Which, yeah, will absolutely affect their relationship for sure, but so far no one's said anything about going no-contact. Now, if the mom wants to stop seeing OP bc of it instead of realizing that her unacceptable behavior is what made OP not want to share her special day with her, then that would be on her and a big show of *her* character, and imo, OP would be better off without someone like that. \n\nBut OP definitely needs to keep up this mentality of not rewarding her mom's bad behavior and setting boundaries to make sure she can be treated with respect and love in this relationship instead of whatever the mom's pulling now. \n\n>OP\u2019s mom is being an AH but it\u2019s not abusive. \n\nEh, it is, but I'll admit she was doing better. It's great that she seemed to have stopped for a while, but yes, what she was doing in the beginning, constantly insulting someone and putting them down? That's verbal abuse. She was being verbally abusive toward OP's partner (if he was there while she insulted him, that makes it worse).", "Ah, yeah, that's not how that came off, unfortunately", "It was clear to me that she was referring to the sub not this specific post."]}
