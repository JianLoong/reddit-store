They were late for everything while I grew up and they refuse to care about being late. They do not care how disrespectful it is to everyone else. \n\nMy older siblings have adjusted to this by planning all kinds of slack into their schedules. Our parents showed up late to both of their weddings but that had been accounted for so they were able to participate in the weddings as planned. The same goes for family get togethers that are hosted by anyone other than my parents. My siblings plan for them to be late. \n\nI went the other way. When my parents were late for my high school graduation I told them that I would NEVER wait for them for any event that I had power over. And I have held to that. When my wife and I hosted our first thanksgiving after we bought our home we started eating on time. My parents showed up late after visiting with other family and were surprised to see us all laying around in tryptophan comas. \n\nMy wife and I got married last weekend and the ceremony went perfectly. Other than my mother not being involved in the candle lighting. My older sister was my backup. \n\nMy parents showed up 3/4 of the way through the ceremony and ended up sitting at the back of the church. They kept everything in during the receiving line and the formals. But they let me have it afterwards and before the reception. They were very disappointed that they did not get to participate in the ceremony and that they missed so much of it. I was ready for this. I had one of my friends waiting and he took their pictures when they were entering the church and sitting down at the back. He sent me the pictures as a text and as email. \n\nI asked my parents to show me their invitations. They did not have it with them so I pulled out the one I had ready for this. I showed them the time on the invitation. I asked them what time they showed up. They said that they were only five minutes late and that I was an asshole for not waiting. \n\nI pulled up my text messages and my email. both provided a time stamp of when they showed up 35 minutes late. They said that if I knew they were going to be late that I should have planned for it like my siblings. I told them that I had not put up with their bullshit since I graduated from high school and why they thought I would start now almost 15 years later? I told them that my siblings could coddle them all they wanted but to enjoy their time with me they had better learn to be punctual. \n\nThey said I was disrespectful and if I did not like their behavior that was entirely my problem.

She made a comment about the food to which I retorted if she would have gotten here on time she could have eaten. \n\nPart of the bet with getting late is if she/ other ILs won the baby shower game, it would go directly to me instead. Welp, she won. My mom handed the prizes to me and she looked so confused. I let her know about the bet and the look on her face was priceless. Didn\u2019t say a word.

I'm struggling to think of a good reason...\n\nNTA", "NTA. I was Best Man for my friend. He and the bride were constantly late. Significantly so. With the MOH, I organized an engagement party in a private room of a restaurant. The happy couple, as usual, was running late. After an hour, the manager told us we\u2019d have to get the dinner service under way or else it would result in a significant up charge as the room was often used as secondary seating on busy nights. So we all sat down to dinner. Bride and groom showed up halfway through the entrees. They both looked crestfallen. This was in the days before cell phones were ubiquitous. We tried phoning their apartment, which was a block away, but didn\u2019t get an answer. Their noses were a bit out of joint for the rest of the evening. I really couldn\u2019t have cared less.\n\nETA: do your parents know your siblings pad their arrival times to mitigate against their chronic lateness? If so, does that tend to see them bleed their lateness into that time too?", "Hard NTA. Late people have to be my biggest pet peeve. If your parents haven't learned to be respectful of your time and everybody else's, I don't see why you would be respectful of theirs. Accommodating this type of people will just make them continue to take advantage of this. Please continue to stand your ground on this.", "NTA.  You handled it brilliantly.  Never wait for people like this. Why inconvenience everyone else for two inconsiderate people? \n\nYour siblings could have helped break them of this habit but enabled it instead.  You gave your parents plenty of notice you would not be doing the same. \n\nAnd good for you for having someone intercept them at the ceremonies and not letting them disturb it. Keep it up!", "To me, intentional lateness is rude, controlling and very hurtful behavior. Of course, we all experience circumstances beyond our control that make us late, but those situations are uncommon and, in the case of an even that\u2019s truly important to us, we can take steps to be sure that even unforeseen circumstances won\u2019t make us late. IMO consistently being late send the message that we don\u2019t care and that we think we are important enough that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have to wait for us. \n\nWhat a shame that your parents are assholes to you and your sibs. \n\nNTA\n\nETA, congratulations on your wedding!

They don't care that people are waiting for them because their time is more valuable. I refuse to cater to it as well. \n\nGood for you for making your boundary clear OP and enforcing the consequences. Usually when you do that and keep showing that you'll do that, people will stop their nonsense around you and just pull it on others.

How did your parents ever even get married if they can't be anywhere on time? I sympathise to the extent that I have no sense of time at all, but that's *my* issue for *me* to deal with. Set alarms, write notes, lay clothes out, wash hair the night before, check time compulsively, anything to avoid inconveniencing somebody else. There definitely aren't any mitigating factors like ADHD, dyspraxia, chronic pain, etc? If there isn't, your parents are being incredibly thoughtless and honestly quite selfish. Your siblings are enabling this and prolonging this madness.", "As someone whose in-laws were always two hours late to everything and joked that they were on \"Sawyer Time,\" you are NTA.  \n\nI'm sorry they missed your wedding, but it wouldn't be right to inconvenience all of your guests for their unwillingness to get to the church on time.", "I have relatives like your parents.

Your response was brilliant and executed beautifully.\n\nIt definitely sucks because I know I would want my parents at my wedding, but with their history, I would have done the same. \n\nI think you need to sit down with your siblings and give them and your parents a reality check. This is more than just \"time blindness,\" or over schedulers mis-managing their time, this is narcissism. They WANT to be late, and it's 100% a power thing.

They place no value on your time, but theirs is invaluable.", "NTA, but your parents sure are entitled AHs for showing up late.

Well done sir...well done!", "NTA.  You have taken the perfect stance.", "NTA congratulations on your wedding and standing up for  yourself. You know what is important to you and you stood up for it.

She and my parents arrived ON TIME, and I am incredibly grateful to her. For anything else, I'd just have started without them, but I plan that to be my ONLY wedding, and I wanted them to be there for it. \n\nHonestly, OP, it's water under the bridge now, but better to assign a sibling or two to get them there on time than point out they are incredibly late.

They\u2019re part of the wedding party. Not sure how much earlier they\u2019re supposed to be because each wedding is different. \nIt depends on what kind of responsibilities they have or not. Sometimes there is set up and decorating to be done. Other times they get dressed at the venue, or together somewhere as part of a group bonding thing throughout the morning or afternoon, often divided by male and female parties yada yada. Usually women take longer than men but generally speaking the wedding party are there to support the couple on their day in anyway they need. \nIf you are in the wedding party it is generally expected that your day is not roll out of bed, (do whatever you want for the day), climb into their outfits, get dolled up and go to the venue the way any other guest would and show up within that last 15 minutes. \n\nThey were exceptionally late. It was out of touch, disrespectful and extremely rude.\n\n\nEven if they weren\u2019t especially involved in the wedding this is their child. A hopefully once in a lifetime event.

Other than my mother not being involved in the candle lighting. My older sister was my backup. \n\nMy parents showed up 3/4 of the way through the ceremony and ended up sitting at the back of the church. They kept everything in during the receiving line and the formals. But they let me have it afterwards and before the reception. They were very disappointed that they did not get to participate in the ceremony and that they missed so much of it. I was ready for this. I had one of my friends waiting and he took their pictures when they were entering the church and sitting down at the back. He sent me the pictures as a text and as email. \n\nI asked my parents to show me their invitations. They did not have it with them so I pulled out the one I had ready for this. I showed them the time on the invitation. I asked them what time they showed up. They said that they were only five minutes late and that I was an asshole for not waiting. \n\nI pulled up my text messages and my email. both provided a time stamp of when they showed up 35 minutes late. They said that if I knew they were going to be late that I should have planned for it like my siblings. I told them that I had not put up with their bullshit since I graduated from high school and why they thought I would start now almost 15 years later? I told them that my siblings could coddle them all they wanted but to enjoy their time with me they had better learn to be punctual. \n\nThey said I was disrespectful and if I did not like their behavior that was entirely my problem. I agreed and said I would be handling all my time with them the exact same way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Manage accordingly by whatever means necessary and get there on time, or miss out and don't complain.", "Time blindedness is a thing. But many of us who suffer from it create strategies to help us get by. I.e Alexa reminders, alarms etc, or we turn up stupidly early to things instead. The difference in managing it depends on levels of self awareness and yes, very much what you said - entitlement. \nI have time blindedness and I think my mum has it too. If mum ever offered to drop us at airport we would tell her the check in time an hour early in order to make the cut off (sometimes we still only just made it) or we just made our own way.  It was kind that she would offer but actually we knew it would be stressful to give her that responsibility.\nThe day finally happened that she missed a plane flight of her own and was outraged she wasn't allowed on the plane late. She was outraged no one in the family offered sympathy. Also a friend established a 'stop-loss' system with her. If there was a meet up and mum was more than 10mins late the friend advised she would no longer be waiting.  The friend followed through. Mum told me all about this just gobsmacked at the approach. But actually I think it helped her get a bit better. The anxiety over the consequences forced her to try harder. \n\nIt takes a level of executive functioning to estimate time required to carry out a process, and some people genuinely have executive function difficulties.

I admire OPs boundary setting!", "The problem also is that everyone essentially lets them get away with it because \u201cthey\u2019re the parents.\u201d Which is morally wrong. Parents are supposed to set an example for their children adult or young. These specific people think they\u2019ve gotten some type of diplomatic parental immunity from all consequences, and can do whatever they want and show up whenever they want. They don\u2019t respect anyone, yet demand respect back. \n\nIf you were late to one of their events, its entirely possible you\u2019d never hear the end of it from them.

(Not that they have to, but it's certainly one of the things I've seen parents doing at weddings I've been involved in.) \n\nIt's them missing out on being there to be involved with, to experience, as much of the day as possible. (Side-note: I wonder if they even realize how much they might have actually missed out on.)\n\nHeck, with multiple weddings I've been involved in, including my own, the wedding party photos were all done before the ceremony. Parents showing up even just on time for the ceremony would have totally missed out on that.\n\nOn the flip side, I sort of get the impression that OP knew that, even if he'd given the arrival time he and his bride had planned for the rest of the wedding party, his parents wouldn't be on time. That for the purposes of the ceremony, they couldn't be counted on to be much more than just guests.\n\nAll in all, it sounds like OP has just accepted his parents for who they are, but doesn't see that it's worth it to try to shield them from the consequences of their choices.\n\nOverall, I think OP is NTA.", "I don\u2019t care of we\u2019re getting married a two minute walk away from their house.  There\u2019s no way my parents wouldn\u2019t be there way early anyway both to help out and because they\u2019re just so excited to be there.\n\nI suppose they might be late due to plane travel+hurricane, or major medical issue, but that level of unavoidable delay is the only reason.", "No. We/You can help it.

They could've done that. They could've gone to one of OP's siblings' homes to get ready. Do you think they'd have been kicked out if they showed up an hour early to their kid's wedding? If my wife showed up to a family wedding late enough to affect proceedings, she would be mortified at herself, not angry at the people getting married. \n\nThis wasn't a refusal to keep disability in mind, this was OP refusing to bow to what is pretty clearly a power play on his parent's part.
