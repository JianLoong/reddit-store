They were late for everything while I grew up and they refuse to care about being late. They do not care how disrespectful it is to everyone else. \n\nMy older siblings have adjusted to this by planning all kinds of slack into their schedules. Our parents showed up late to both of their weddings but that had been accounted for so they were able to participate in the weddings as planned. The same goes for family get togethers that are hosted by anyone other than my parents. My siblings plan for them to be late. \n\nI went the other way. When my parents were late for my high school graduation I told them that I would NEVER wait for them for any event that I had power over. And I have held to that. When my wife and I hosted our first thanksgiving after we bought our home we started eating on time. My parents showed up late after visiting with other family and were surprised to see us all laying around in tryptophan comas. \n\nMy wife and I got married last weekend and the ceremony went perfectly. Other than my mother not being involved in the candle lighting. My older sister was my backup. \n\nMy parents showed up 3/4 of the way through the ceremony and ended up sitting at the back of the church. They kept everything in during the receiving line and the formals. But they let me have it afterwards and before the reception. They were very disappointed that they did not get to participate in the ceremony and that they missed so much of it. I was ready for this. I had one of my friends waiting and he took their pictures when they were entering the church and sitting down at the back. He sent me the pictures as a text and as email. \n\nI asked my parents to show me their invitations. They did not have it with them so I pulled out the one I had ready for this. I showed them the time on the invitation. I asked them what time they showed up. They said that they were only five minutes late and that I was an asshole for not waiting. \n\nI pulled up my text messages and my email. both provided a time stamp of when they showed up 35 minutes late. They said that if I knew they were going to be late that I should have planned for it like my siblings. I told them that I had not put up with their bullshit since I graduated from high school and why they thought I would start now almost 15 years later? I told them that my siblings could coddle them all they wanted but to enjoy their time with me they had better learn to be punctual. \n\nThey said I was disrespectful and if I did not like their behavior that was entirely my problem.

She made a comment about the food to which I retorted if she would have gotten here on time she could have eaten. \n\nPart of the bet with getting late is if she/ other ILs won the baby shower game, it would go directly to me instead. Welp, she won. My mom handed the prizes to me and she looked so confused. I let her know about the bet and the look on her face was priceless. Didn\u2019t say a word.

With the MOH, I organized an engagement party in a private room of a restaurant. The happy couple, as usual, was running late. After an hour, the manager told us we\u2019d have to get the dinner service under way or else it would result in a significant up charge as the room was often used as secondary seating on busy nights. So we all sat down to dinner. Bride and groom showed up halfway through the entrees. They both looked crestfallen. This was in the days before cell phones were ubiquitous. We tried phoning their apartment, which was a block away, but didn\u2019t get an answer. Their noses were a bit out of joint for the rest of the evening. I really couldn\u2019t have cared less.\n\nETA: do your parents know your siblings pad their arrival times to mitigate against their chronic lateness? If so, does that tend to see them bleed their lateness into that time too?", "Hard NTA. Late people have to be my biggest pet peeve. If your parents haven't learned to be respectful of your time and everybody else's, I don't see why you would be respectful of theirs. Accommodating this type of people will just make them continue to take advantage of this. Please continue to stand your ground on this.", "NTA.  You handled it brilliantly.  Never wait for people like this. Why inconvenience everyone else for two inconsiderate people? \n\nYour siblings could have helped break them of this habit but enabled it instead.  You gave your parents plenty of notice you would not be doing the same. \n\nAnd good for you for having someone intercept them at the ceremonies and not letting them disturb it. Keep it up!", "To me, intentional lateness is rude, controlling and very hurtful behavior. Of course, we all experience circumstances beyond our control that make us late, but those situations are uncommon and, in the case of an even that\u2019s truly important to us, we can take steps to be sure that even unforeseen circumstances won\u2019t make us late. IMO consistently being late send the message that we don\u2019t care and that we think we are important enough that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have to wait for us. \n\nWhat a shame that your parents are assholes to you and your sibs. \n\nNTA\n\nETA, congratulations on your wedding!

They don't care that people are waiting for them because their time is more valuable. I refuse to cater to it as well. \n\nGood for you for making your boundary clear OP and enforcing the consequences. Usually when you do that and keep showing that you'll do that, people will stop their nonsense around you and just pull it on others.

How did your parents ever even get married if they can't be anywhere on time? I sympathise to the extent that I have no sense of time at all, but that's *my* issue for *me* to deal with. Set alarms, write notes, lay clothes out, wash hair the night before, check time compulsively, anything to avoid inconveniencing somebody else. There definitely aren't any mitigating factors like ADHD, dyspraxia, chronic pain, etc? If there isn't, your parents are being incredibly thoughtless and honestly quite selfish. Your siblings are enabling this and prolonging this madness.", "As someone whose in-laws were always two hours late to everything and joked that they were on \"Sawyer Time,\" you are NTA.  \n\nI'm sorry they missed your wedding, but it wouldn't be right to inconvenience all of your guests for their unwillingness to get to the church on time.", "I have relatives like your parents.

Your response was brilliant and executed beautifully.\n\nIt definitely sucks because I know I would want my parents at my wedding, but with their history, I would have done the same. \n\nI think you need to sit down with your siblings and give them and your parents a reality check. This is more than just \"time blindness,\" or over schedulers mis-managing their time, this is narcissism. They WANT to be late, and it's 100% a power thing.

They place no value on your time, but theirs is invaluable.", "NTA, but your parents sure are entitled AHs for showing up late.

Well done sir...well done!", "NTA.  You have taken the perfect stance.", "NTA congratulations on your wedding and standing up for  yourself. You know what is important to you and you stood up for it.

She and my parents arrived ON TIME, and I am incredibly grateful to her. For anything else, I'd just have started without them, but I plan that to be my ONLY wedding, and I wanted them to be there for it. \n\nHonestly, OP, it's water under the bridge now, but better to assign a sibling or two to get them there on time than point out they are incredibly late.

They\u2019re part of the wedding party. Not sure how much earlier they\u2019re supposed to be because each wedding is different. \nIt depends on what kind of responsibilities they have or not. Sometimes there is set up and decorating to be done. Other times they get dressed at the venue, or together somewhere as part of a group bonding thing throughout the morning or afternoon, often divided by male and female parties yada yada. Usually women take longer than men but generally speaking the wedding party are there to support the couple on their day in anyway they need. \nIf you are in the wedding party it is generally expected that your day is not roll out of bed, (do whatever you want for the day), climb into their outfits, get dolled up and go to the venue the way any other guest would and show up within that last 15 minutes. \n\nThey were exceptionally late. It was out of touch, disrespectful and extremely rude.\n\n\nEven if they weren\u2019t especially involved in the wedding this is their child. A hopefully once in a lifetime event.

Other than my mother not being involved in the candle lighting. My older sister was my backup. \n\nMy parents showed up 3/4 of the way through the ceremony and ended up sitting at the back of the church. They kept everything in during the receiving line and the formals. But they let me have it afterwards and before the reception. They were very disappointed that they did not get to participate in the ceremony and that they missed so much of it. I was ready for this. I had one of my friends waiting and he took their pictures when they were entering the church and sitting down at the back. He sent me the pictures as a text and as email. \n\nI asked my parents to show me their invitations. They did not have it with them so I pulled out the one I had ready for this. I showed them the time on the invitation. I asked them what time they showed up. They said that they were only five minutes late and that I was an asshole for not waiting. \n\nI pulled up my text messages and my email. both provided a time stamp of when they showed up 35 minutes late. They said that if I knew they were going to be late that I should have planned for it like my siblings. I told them that I had not put up with their bullshit since I graduated from high school and why they thought I would start now almost 15 years later? I told them that my siblings could coddle them all they wanted but to enjoy their time with me they had better learn to be punctual. \n\nThey said I was disrespectful and if I did not like their behavior that was entirely my problem. I agreed and said I would be handling all my time with them the exact same way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Imagine my mom\u2019s and my surprise when we pulled up to the church at the time we actually needed to be there and saw his entire family there! \n\nThey were concerned about whether something had happened to us, but they were there, because they made the effort to show up on time (or at least a whole lot less late) for an event they felt was important.\n\nThis was in the early 1990s, so there weren\u2019t cell phones where they could just call us to see where we were at, and the church was quite a drive from where we lived, so they couldn\u2019t just pop over to check on us. But they weren\u2019t angry when they realized that we\u2019d given them such an early time. They understood, because they knew their behavior when it came to being somewhere on time.\n\nIf your parents had cared about being on time for your wedding, they would have shown up on time.

Not only does me being late suck for everyone else, but it makes me enter every situation already stressed so for my own personal well being, I have to plan for my own shitty time management accordingly.", "I was raised with an Army dad. If you're not 15 minutes early, you're late.", "Similarly, my dad was always chronically late and I found it very frustrating, so now I'm early. In his defense, he's now being treated for ADHD, ASD, anxiety and an autoimmune condition that caused chronic fatigue and his timing has gotten better.\n\nI, on the other hand, am now chronically early because I got a bonus helping of his anxiety.", "Yep.  Fortunately they\u2019re very attached to their phones and are good about keeping me updated if an appointment runs long or something else happens to derail our meetup time.\n\nI make an equal effort to be on time to meet them as well if we set a specific time to meet.  It\u2019s basic respect.", "It\u2019s not gaslighting; it\u2019s minimizing. They\u2019re not the same thing.", "Only if the intent is to make OP doubt their sanity or such. Not if it's just a lie they think they can get away with.", "It\u2019s not shitty to expect someone, neurodivergent or otherwise, to arrive somewhere on time - especially to an event of this magnitude. You are aware of your shortcomings in this regard, but instead of taking steps and making arrangements to compensate, you choose to lean on the crutch of ADHD to \u201cexcuse\u201d poor behavior. \n\nI have terrible ADHD as well, and have been making life adjustments for it for the last eight years since my formal diagnosis. I can\u2019t tell you the last time I showed up late for something - I\u2019m actually 15 minutes early more often than not, because I\u2019ve learned how to accommodate for my behaviors and tendencies. It is not impossible, nor is it \u201cshitty to expect,\u201d that you do the same.", "So you agree then, that it IS possible to show up on time for things that are important.\n\nLike, say, your own son\u2019s high school graduation or wedding\u2026", "so guess what, you're an asshole! :) you have decided your comfort is more important than showing up on time for other people\n\nI have ADHD and I'll be brutally honest, if I show up late it means i don't give a shit about that person or the event, I'm just going out of obligation. I am on time for shit that matters because I have learned how to wrestle my brain demons.", "It took a lot more effort before we had little supercomputers in our pockets that can keep schedules for us and send reminders of when we need to be somewhere. You don't need to physically remember to leave at 4PM to make a 5PM appointment if you can spend five minutes to set your calendar to remind you that you should get ready at 3:30 PM, and then leave at 4PM.", "Yes, they don't get to see the wedding. He doesn't get to have his parents there. Both paid a cost.", "My parents are late for everything, and we scheduled groom (me) and groomsmen/family photos for before the wedding as a buffer. They were late for the photos of course, but at least it meant they were on time for the ceremony.", "My sister did both.  The ones not requiring the bride and groom together were done beforehand, like my sister pinning a corsage on Mom's blouse.  Those kinds of things.  The rest were afterwards.  I think she did it to streamline time.\n\nMy wedding was a lot less formal, and I didn't want all of those kinds of photos, so we did them all after.", "We did some family photos before the wedding, 25 years ago. The wedding was quite late, and the reception not long - the photographer was supposed to focus on candids afterwards.", "This is me too, and then I even joined the army and made it worse...  LOL.", "Yeah no duh to an event of this magnitude, literally said ADHD people wouldn't miss something like this: it's novelle, it's important, and it has negative consequences if late- those are both big external motivators for ADHD.\n\nI would never be late for a wedding or anything that is \\*actually\\* dependent on my arrival to begin (ie if I'm leading a meeting, or i'm carpooling). I'm aware of it as one of my MANY shortcomings with ADHD/OCD/Depression that I am actively working to overcome and priortize.\n\nLike I said, I really don't want to be a burden or inconveinece to anyone, but constantly feeling like a disappointment, and a failure and worrying everyone's going to be mad me, because I'm going to be 4 minutes late wasn't healthy for me and my cortisol levels. \n\nBecause a lot of the times I was stressing over were arbitrary, my friends didn't care, my boss didn't care, and public transit is always unreliable. So I asked for accomodations, my boss is chill and gives me an hour window to arrive for work (I just stay later) and my friends give me 15-30 minute windows to arrive so I'm not stressiing or berating myself for \\*just\\* missing the exact subway that would have gotten me there in time. \n\nIt's great that time managment is something you have priortized, I'm only 3 years into my formal diagnosis, and honestly overcoming the comorbid depression symtoms and negative self-talk is more of a priority right now than focusing on fixing my ADHD symptoms that may be annoying/burdensome to nuerotypical folk. \n\nI'm know I am a more kind, considerate, respectful person than some nuerotypical people who are simply punctual, this one flaw does not make me a horrible disrespectul person like society, this comment section, and in turn my own self-talk says to me when I am late. I'm literally doing my best, I am not a bad person for struggling.", "No, the parents paid the cost. They weren\u2019t on time. As he said, he can\u2019t coddle grown-ass adults. That is not the key to a happy life.", "Photos with the groom are fine, but the person I replied to was specifically talking about photos with the bride and groom together.", "Yes, a specific form, not what happened here", "Je vois ce que tu as fait l\u00e0. Tr\u00e8s dr\u00f4le!", "Underrated comment. I snorted.", "lol", "Well, they\u2019ve been late to every single important thing his whole life while claiming they weren\u2019t and/or it was his fault they were when it really wasn\u2019t his fault.  That\u2018s pretty prolonged."]}
