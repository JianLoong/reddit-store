What kind of 1950s propaganda bullshit is that?", "yes YTA, first of all NOT your kid and second just because someone uses weed doesn't mean they are going to become a junkie.

But she told you she was aware and that it is not a concern to her. Stop telling other people how to parent and yes, she would be right to kick you out of her home if you keep telling her what to do. \n\nWhy do you need to \"keep explaining yourself?\" You told her he smokes, she said she knows, case closed.", "I mean, you are definitely TA.\n\n\nDo I think underage kids should smoke? No. \n\nBut drinking is WAY worse and a whole lot of them do that too, and some parents take a similar approach- have an open dialogue about it with their kids so it's not an activity they have to sneak off to do.\n\nAlso, it's normal enough that you don't have to make it sound like he's going to become a \"junkie\".\n\n\nMost importantly, you can give your two cents in a more respectful way when someone is providing a roof over your head.\n\nYTA.", ">She and her son stopped talking to me and now I\u2019m scared she\u2019ll kick me out over this.\n\nThat's how you know YTA.

Not your child, not your business. And people don't become \"junkies\" from weed.", "YTA\n\nNot your house, not your kid means this is not your business. You gave her your viewpoint on the matter, now drop it. It's not your place to raise her kid.\nHow would you like a house guest, that your helping out, telling you how to raise your kid?", "YTA for a multitude of reasons. \n\n1. It is not your house, you are a guest. It's not negatively effecting you, be grateful you have family willing to help you in this situation\n2. Never in life should we try to enforce our beliefs on others, even moreso when we're guests in someone else's house that they're kind enough to let you stay in\n3. She's the mother it's her son, that means it's an A and B conversation so C you're way out of it\n4. You're equating a few occasional tokes to him becoming a junkie? You sound like a bad DARE commercial and wouldn't be surprised if you also blame rap lyrics and violent videogames for children's behavior\n\nBest advice I can give you, avoid giving unsolicited advice and don't try to tell people how to run their lives (or their child's). You're the one getting yourself kicked out for overstepping boundaries", "YTA, not your house, not your kid. No more to say.", "You\u2019re awfully bold considering you are a guest in your sister AND nephew\u2019s home. Your nephew doesn\u2019t need to you parent him. Remember your manners. YTA", "I'd kick you out too. It's not your kid and not your business. And as far as him becoming a junkie from smoking weed, did you just step out of the 1960s or something? Nobody believes that propaganda anymore. yta", "YTA. \n\nYou can't pay rent, you sure as hell CAN keep your mouth shut. \n\nYour sister has a home and has taken care of a child for 17 years, you are 28 and had to move in with your sister. Who do you think has more parenting experience?", "YTA. From my experience making things forbidden makes them more tempting. He's 17, legaly an adult in a year, he's not a 10 yr old. If it's not legal in the state, by not making a big deal out of it, and turning it into a topic to have a discussion about - and something he is willing to discuss with her she's actually being safe. She's ensuring she knows what he is up to, and that there are limitations- without making it the forbidden fruit that he will bury himself in. I know several people who weren't allowed to experiment, and then threw themselves into anything because they were made curious. On the other hand I was sat down explained about the many drugs - why it was suggested I not do them - and told that it wa my decision however and all that was asked was that I do anything safely, and my parents were aware so they knew I wasn't taken advantage of. I've never done anything harder than pot, and have done that only a handful of times. Sometimes treating a teen like an adult and letting them make their own decisions goes a long way - whereas treating them like a child makes them more likely to rebel. Yes there are limits, but I personally don't feel pot, in a legal state for a 17 yr old falls in that category.", "YTA, It's really none of your business how she raises her son, and you should've just stayed out of it. I'm also curious if you would've reacted the same way had you caught him drinking, or if you're just particularly prejudiced against weed.", "YTA.\n\nHer house and her kid. I don't agree with a minor smoking weed either, but not your place to drop ultimatums when camping at her house.\n\nTime to find somewhere else if it's that upsetting.", "Yta how the kid is brought up is nothing to do with you plus weed is legal so keep your prejudices to yourself", "YTA, it's her child, not yours, and if that's legal where you live, I don't see a problem, especially if she thinks it's okay.", "YTA.\n\nNot your circus, not your monkey.\n\nFor what it's worth, there's definitely a line in the sand somewhere here e.g. if this was crack we were talking about it would be a whole different conversation. But it's weed, which is relatively benign even if I personally would rather my kids not do it.", "YTA\n\n1. She\u2019s letting you stay rent free, out of the kindness of her heart\n2. You are not the parent\n3. She told you to stop, yet you still think you know how to be a better parent. Your audacity is mind blowing\n4. Even after telling you she was ok with him smoking, you feel the need to air your argument here\n5. Be damn glad she\u2019s your sister. If you were mine, and spoke to me like that, you\u2019d be kicked out. \n\nShe\u2019s being kind to you, and this is how you repay her. Go work on yourself before you try to tell others how to parent their kid!", "YTA, he\u2019s not going to become a fucking junkie calm down.  My mom was the exact same with me as a teenager.  She knew I smoked and didn\u2019t care if a kept my grades up.  This actually taught me how to be more responsible and still be able to relax and have fun.  I smoked all through college and masters degree and got basically all As the whole time.  I learned how to balance both because my mom wasn\u2019t a super strict parent.  Being super strict usually only leads to worse outcomes.  Your nephew will be fine and your sister sounds like a cool ass mom.", "YTA Not your place to judge and make demands on how she raises her child. Plus, it's actually good that she has an eye on his use because, face it, if she were to discipline or even forbid it, he'd do it in secret where she can't see what he smokes and with whom he hangs out with when he's high. THAT can lead to getting in contact with hard drugs.\n\n\nSmoking weed doesn't make you a junkie. Not saying that it's completely without danger, especially if the use goes out of hand, but that applies to other legal drugs as well. Alcohol for example.", "YTA. \n\nNot your child. \nNot your house. \n\nSmoking cannabis won\u2019t make him a junkie.", "YTA.\n\n\u201cHer son\u201d is YOUR nephew. \n\nHow would you like if he told your sister that you stank of laziness because you\u2019re bumming off of her? Exactly. You wouldn\u2019t.\n\nMind your business and stop trying to gatekeep her parenting, especially when she doesn\u2019t gatekeep your inability to adult.", "YTA. Honestly it\u2019s non of your business what HER son does. Just remember you\u2019re living under her roof not yours. \n\nSure she is setting her child up for possibly failure but that\u2019s her son and her choice. Also she makes a very good choice about wanting to know what he does and him not keeping it a secret.", "YTA\n\nHer parenting choices are none of your business. I wouldn\u2019t make the same choices but it isn\u2019t my kid.\n\nBiting the hand that feeds you is not the smartest move.", "yes YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, he's not your kid. NEVER try to tell a parent how to parent their own child.\n\nSecond, you are living in her house for free. Mind your buisness.", "YTA. You voiced your concern. That's ok. She told you she is ok with him smoking. That should have been the end of it here. \n\nAnd weed isn't the gateway drug some people make it out to be. That would be legal pain pills. And it is probably still safer than alcohol.", "YTA. Not your circus, not your monkey. Mind ya business if you want to stay with them.", "YTA not your business.  Stop pearl clutching\u2026 teaching abstinence of any kind doesn\u2019t work. I am with your sister I would rather it not be some taboo secret and anyway He\u2019s 17 almost 18 almost an adult \n.. not your circus not your monkeys.", "YTA, mind your business.  Your sister's right. If the most she has to worry about is him smoking weed at 17 and he keeps his grades up who cares.  She's probably just glad she can oversee his use and he confides in her about it because let me tell you there are way worse things that can happen once you start going down the road of being overly controlling and disciplining for something that's not that big of a deal, especially when he's a year away at most to being an adult.  It's also not your place to tell her how to discipline her child.", "YTA. You were on solid ground expressing concern about your nephew's habits. But if his mother is aware and doesn't want your advice, well, you're not playing from a position of strength here. Since you are a guest in their home, it's not the best time or place to get judgemental. You're entering asshole territory by picking an unnecessary fight.", "YTA for insisting she discipline him for it. Look, you had good intentions and based on your history I can see why you\u2019re concerned. But at the end of the day he\u2019s not your kid and he\u2019s not your responsibility. You need to apologize for overstepping your boundaries and leave the issue alone.", "YTA.. Your Sis has 12 more years of life experience on you. She's a single parent of a 17 yr old young man who's getting good grades. She gives you a place to live, rent free. And you proceed to try and tell her how to run her and her son's life? Keep it up and you will be pointed to the door to live with the next relative in line.", "YTA it\u2019s her home and her family and you are t even contributing", "YTA, he'll be a legal adult in less than a month. He's getting good grades and apparently is being careful enough that the only tell is his hoodie. Drinking is not the same as smoking weed. They're two different substances that affect people differently. His mom sounds like she's going out of her way to be a cool mom, but it's not your place to dictate how she parents.", "She knows he smokes and is okay with it, they have a parent/child relationship that most parents dream of...respectful children who feel comfortable enough with their parent to keep them looped into their daily lives.\n\n\nYou need to stay in your own, non-parent lane and let her parent her son.\n\n\nYTA\n\n\n[edited for spelling]", "YTA although your intention was good but yeah, after telling her and receiving her answer you should\u2019ve dropped it. You should apologize for pushing too much, doesn\u2019t mean you have to agree.\nYou can disagree with her while still respecting her house & her rules.", "YTA. I don't know why you think you kept needing to \"explain yourself.\" You brought up that he must be smoking, she indicated that she was fine with it. Then it was time for you to stop talking about it. Stop trying to impose your rules on her and her family! It is not your business.\n\nYou owe her an apology, especially since you may well get kicked out for your rude attitude.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re his aunt, not his mother. Respect your sister\u2019s decisions on how to raise HER SON. If you were truly concerned about your nephew\u2019s welfare that\u2019s one thing, but it seems like you clearly just believe you know more than your sister or that you believe your world view is somehow better. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to impose yourself on her, her kid, or their relationship, and especially not when they\u2019ve been kind enough you welcome you into their home.", "Unsolicited advice is just thinly veiled criticism.\n\n\nThe way you came at your sister, I would have had a problem with it as well. It didn\u2019t seem to be from a place of love and actual concern.\n\nThe way you\u2019ve talked about your sister makes me wonder if you even like her and equating smoking weed occasionally to becoming a full fledged junkie is ridiculous. \nTrying to justify it by saying you once had a problem with substances is even more so.\nWeed and alcohol are vastly different, as is the way they affect the brain. Also, just because you were an addict doesn\u2019t mean that everyone who partakes is or will be one.\n\nThe fact that you had to come here and ask if you were the asshole after making demands of your sister, who let you stay with her rent free and indefinitely, and how she parents while claiming to know better than her and know her sons future without any actual parenting experience of your own\u2026 I mean Asshole should be in bright red letters on your forehead\u2026", "Before he becomes a junky lmao\n\nDid you roll up his hoodie sleeves to see if he's been injecting marijuanas? \n\nYTA", "YTA. You should be scared to get kicked out because you probably will if you don\u2019t stop being so damn nosey. \n\nSmoking weed every now and then in a safe space as a near-adult is not going to hurt him if he is doing fine in school and other areas of development. It sounds like your sister understands reason and moderation and is parenting her child accordingly.\n\nAlso LOL & \u201cjunkie\u201d\u2026 please. Go back to the drug war era and stay there.", "Wow you\u2019re comparing your alcohol addiction with his occasional weed use? Alcohol is so much more addictive and is one of the most dangerous substances in the world, responsible for SO many deaths\u2026 unlike weed.", "YTA. You're an unemployed guest in this home and you've insulted the person providing you shelter. While simply pointing it out maybe didn't make you an AH from the get-go given your history, you doubled down after she said she was aware. You then basically criticized her along with her nearly adult child. THEN your apology was not an apology at all, just tripled down on your original stance.", "YTA. Who do you think you are?", "YTA\n\nHer son is not manipulating her. She knows what he's doing and is okay with it. It's none of your business. It's between them. Back off.", "Yep YTA; not your kid, so stay out of it.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s your sisters house and it\u2019s not your place to tell your sister how how to parent her 17 year old. \nFair enough that you told her that her son is smoking weed, you didn\u2019t know that she was aware. She\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s fine with it though, and it should have been enough to make you back off.  Maybe not a popular opinion but there are worse things in the world. They seem to have good communication with each other judging by the fact they can talk about it. You went too far and owe her an apology. \n\nProbably not the same thing and at risk of making my mother sound like a terrible parent, but she found out I was underage drinking at house parties - sometimes fields but she doesn\u2019t know that part and what she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her \ud83d\udc40. I was getting hold of the worst alcohol. In the end she would Just get me something if I was going. Bare in mind, at 16 I was legal to get married and have a kid so\u2026 Legal age here to drink was 18. I had my moments occasionally but I didn\u2019t cause her much issue. She knew where I was, and she knew what I was drinking (mostly). She also let me have a taste of her wine when I was a kid if i asked. And a tiny amount heavily watered down with lemonade or something at Christmas. I\u2019ve had a few moments as a teen because - teen, but overall I ended up growing up to have a very healthy attitude to alcohol. I rarely ever drink as an adult but when I do, its because I fancy it on whatever occasion. My sister I believe is very much the same. I know I made my mother come across like she was just giving me wine all the time - she didn\u2019t aha. But she never made a song and dance about it, and considering she grew up with an alcoholic, and my dad had alcoholic parent as well. \n\nI credit my mums attitude and making the decision not to make it this massive forbidden thing, for my healthier attitude to drinking. In my head it made sense to relate this with your sister and nephew, not sure now but put it this way - it\u2019s likely there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll do typical teen stuff. He\u2019s having his experiences - which doesn\u2019t mean he needs disciplined. It\u2019s a part of growing up. I\u2019m sure you had your experiences too. Your sister knows. She isn\u2019t concerned and unless he is getting into trouble and doing things that hurt other people in whatever way, you need to back off.\n\nEdit: because my ADHD told me too.", "YTA", "YTA", "Not your house, not your kid.
