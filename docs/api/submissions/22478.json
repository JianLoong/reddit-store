If you truly want him on your team when this child is born, you better figure out what love looks like, and give him the apology he deserves. Follow that up with a lot of empathy.

If she can shout at a grown man till he cries and still think she's done nothing wrong, what's gonna happen to her kid? I pity them.", "It\u2019s very partially the husbands fault for doing things that they don\u2019t understand in it being not ok but it\u2019s MASSIVELY OP\u2019s fault for saying something like that to someone who is on the spectrum and doesn\u2019t understand societal norms and social cues and doesn\u2019t seem to understand anything about coexisting with someone on the spectrum and i should know as i\u2019m also on the spectrum i\u2019d say it\u2019s 90% OP\u2019s AH compared to 10% OP\u2019s partner", ">I'm about to turn 30 and would like to know if I would be getting the super power that prevents me from spilling ice cream on myself.\n\nSpoiler : you dont. sorry. its a myth.", "No but it's a stressor just like someone berating you is.  More often than not stress responses remain the same or similar no matter the cause.  A baby crying and his wife asking for help....not to mention if he's such an extreme Germaphobe a baby may send him running for his pillow every day.", "Actually quite well... but since this the internet ,specifically reddit ,nothing I say will matter in the least.", "as you said it, TODDLERS. her husband is nearly 30, there is absolutely no excuse to act like a toddler at that age. her mistake was marrying this big baby and giving him a child, while knowing that she has to change his diapers.", "Dude you just fucking hate this guy, what is wrong with you?", "Never *let* him cook? How condescending. Ever thought about cooking together so he can learn to do it on his own?\n\nCurious who is the main earner in this relationship.", "Please don't tell me you only stayed because your pregnant. It really sounds like you don't want to be with him anymore.", "Exactly, if someone did this to their fired when I was sitting next to them, guess what. I wouldn\u2019t even notice it. Nobody\u2019s gonna be watching him eat or give a shit how he eats.", "If I would've been willing to dump my child cause they have autism then I wouldn't have married someone with autism in the first place, what kind of question is even that ?", "It's a description used by many professionals, so while it may not be the most current classification, it does exist. Source: several doctor visits.", "Do you have any idea how autism works?", "Wow I hope you never have an autistic kid you probably put them in ABA immediately", "What about any of his actions make you think he needs to get his act together? Did OP say he can't perform basic household tasks, manage important dates and documents, or anything that would imply he'd struggle with raising a kid?", "Someone on the spectrum can\u2019t just magically \u201cget his act\u201d together. That\u2019s not how ASD works.", "No. She CHOSE to have a child with an autistic man and then make fun of him for being autistic. Get a grip on reality before making such stupid comments.", "You can't control your hormones, but you can control your actions. Hormones might explain why someone acted the way they did, but it does not excuse those actions.", "No it\u2019s not he has autism he literally cannot help it. Unless you want a screaming crying hitting himself grown adult man in the middle of a mall bc that\u2019s what happens when autistic ppl have meltdowns", "While I personally would eat the whole fry, why does it matter that he only eats half?\n\nI\u2019m always confused about why people give a dam about what other people do with their food. He could easily say the other half isn\u2019t salted as much and I doubt she would bat an eye. There are better hills to die on.\n\nYTA OP", "I agree. It is mostly her fault, but then hormones are surging when she is pregnant and I feel that hormones can be accountable for like half of her percentage. But even than. Mostly her fault.", "So how in your pretzel brain does this justify OPs actions? Are you nuts?", "Or because I\u2019m autistic and know that he can\u2019t help it", "You are going too easy on OP.  This clears wasn\u2019t just a new thing, this is an ongoing personal trait.  \n\nYes those behaviors are childish to us but we don\u2019t have autism.  She shouldn\u2019t have married and had a kid with someone she doesn\u2019t accept. \n\nESH-  I think they both need therapy.", "Its incredibly how much empathy you lack here with how you insult the husband.\n\nHe is on the spectrum and seemingly a germaphobe which most likely is exacerbated by him being on the spectrum. However, nothing he did was childlike. Sure while refusing to eat some fries may be wasting food, its not the end of the world and adults spill food all the damn time.", "Except she knew who he was (someone on the spectrum)when she married him and decided to have a kid with him.\n\nSo what I'm saying here is they are both adults and can use they grown up words.... I feel she's gonna struggle with the vagaries of babies and toddlers.", "You married someone with autism, but are apparently not willing to tolerate behaviours that are often associated with autism to the point where you will berate your husband in public.\n\nThat's why the question was asked.", "ABA is abuse and should get children put into safe homes away from abusers just be aware of that", "A question that arises after you verbally abuse your autistic husband.", "A sensible one.", "I think the consensus is we are afraid you\u2019re going to abuse your child like you do your husband", "Are you also going to berate your child and call them an embrassment when they don't 'grow out' of their autistic traits?", "I do but my point is is that she never should\u2019ve had a child with somebody that can\u2019t even control themselves enough to act like an adult in Public", "And that\u2019s why they are both at fault she never should\u2019ve had children with him if she was concerned about his ability to act like an adult", "Because he\u2019s behaving like a petulant child in public.", "They never should have had children", "I don\u2019t think her intention was to have somebody that proved to be less than competent at Adulting he should be able to maintain himself in public", "Never said he could help it..where in my comment did I say that.  My point was to point out that I wonder if OP has thought this through and has other support/help.  BTW worked with Autistic Kids for 20 years....", "Sorry for my ignorance, but can I ask what ABA means?"]}
