My parents have stolen alot of money from me over the years including 1k and making me pay them for their damaged items. I think its nice you're paying for your cut and you should be given the receipts so yu can pay the exact amount. If you're a minor and they continue to do this I recommend finding someone to make you a bank account", "NTA. Take her up on this. And I suspect you've been buying more than your share of food this entire time, to be honest.  That would explain both her demand for money and refusal to show the receipts. Hope your costume is awesome, and you need to move out ASAP.", "Sounds like it's time to move out", "You're NTA but honestly, I would just do what she said just to make it easier on **you**.\n\nUse that $70 you'd spend on groceries for stuff you want and stuff you'd actually consume. \n\nWhat they buy / eat will no longer be your concern and it'll be one less thing they can hold over you.", "NTA  \n\nYour mother was being petty and bigoted. Nothing to do with money, just wants you under her thumb.", "Esh", "The rent just went up\u2026.. time to move out of you don\u2019t like the amount.\nYou don\u2019t like your landlord currently , is it time to get a new one?", "INFO: do you pay rent or contribute in any other way?", "NTA, but at 21 it might be time to move out if you think your mom is controlling.", "INFO: Do you pay rent? Are you employed or in school? Do you typically contribute to household expenses but have contributed less because of this jacket?\n\nYou are an adult. Sometimes parents will be kind and allow young adults to stay as a kindness, especially if they are in school and don't have a lot of money to contribute.\n\nIf you are working, and not contributing appropriately,  you are an AH for not contributing. You are not necessarily an AH for asking for a receipt, but if your parents are letting you stay rent free and you are working, it's kind of a petty move. Perhaps separate food is a good solution if you don't trust your parents to use your money for food; but $70 seems very reasonable to me", "ESH. I think you're both being petty. You're contributing to groceries. It's okay for you to buy a jacket. She doesn't need to like it. She isn't the one wearing it and no one asked for her opinion. \n\nIf she wanted more money for food, fair enough. A receipt really isn't necessary. $70 isn't a huge sum of money. You guys both need to start behaving like adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
