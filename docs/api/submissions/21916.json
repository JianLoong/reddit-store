If you had left flowers when no one was present, after the funeral, this would have been fine. But to do it publicly, in explicit violation of the customs of the funeral, shows explicit disrespect to those customs. \n\nBasically, what you did was perceived as showy disrespect, the same as if you had insisted on singing a song despite that being in violation of the cultural practices governing the funeral.", "YTA.

I understand that those flowers mean something special between you and your aunt and that you wanted to show your love for your aunt with it. \n\nbut as far as I understand it she was still part of the Orthodox Jews believe.

The proper thing is a pebble or small rock.", "YTA and there\u2019s no such things as \u201cJewish Christians.\u201d", "Genuinely torn between NAH and ESH, because you and your extended family are coming from such wildly different contexts that I don't think either side understood the other, but both sides also could have behaved better. I think you may not understand how Jews perceive Jewish Christians, which I'm guessing is Messianic Judaism. (I mean, you certainly know that it's negative, but I don't know if you understand how and why.) Even I had to struggle not to put the phrase in quotes. It isn't seen as simply a different religious denomination; it's seen as a very direct betrayal of and insult to Judaism and the Jewish people. So while your gesture was sincere and rooted in your relationship with your aunt, the issue here is not only that you transgressed the ceremony, but the specific way that specifically you did it. Christians praying for or over Jews can, of course, be done in the spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, but has a long and very ugly history. Since nothing was discussed or agreed upon in advance, and you didn't ask anyone's permission or make any effort to contextualize your gesture, what you were doing was unlikely to be taken in that spirit of mutual respect even without the family baggage. Taking that baggage into account: I don't at all think you intended to do something quite this incendiary, but in the rest of the family's eyes, you were compounding/repeating the original insult your parents committed, at one of the worst possible moments.\n\nAnd of course they wouldn't count your brother for the minyan: by any standard in all but the absolute most liberal Jewish communities, he's not a Jew. That part isn't even personal, or doesn't have to be, though I truly understand that it feels bad. (I have a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother, and was not raised in any religion. 95% of Jews wouldn't consider me Jewish unless I convert. I have feelings and opinions about this, and I wish things didn't work this way, but it is nonetheless the case. I consider myself culturally Jewish, but would never imagine I had the standing to participate in a ritual this way, *especially* in an Orthodox context. My emotions and philosophical opinions do not change the realities of the social situation at a funeral.) This is not something where they could just choose to include him to be nice, even if they'd wanted to. For them, it would invalidate the prayer. \n\nYour parents made their religious choices, not you. I don't excuse the cruelty with which your extended family has treated you - Orthodox communities can be incredibly insular and authoritarian. They also could have chosen to react more gracefully to what you did, just as you could have approached it more gracefully. Nonetheless, given the history between your part of the family and the rest, I don't think it was hard to see that keeping your head down would be the best course of action. I recognize that given the lack of relationships and the fact that they were freezing you out, you probably didn't have a chance to talk to anyone about your plans...but that's all the more reason it was foreseeable that this wouldn't be a good idea. \n\nYou can make memorial gestures for your aunt in your own way, away from them. That too honors your relationship with her: it was something she chose to share with you beyond the context of her family and community. Taking it outside is repeating the gesture she made to be in your life.", ">My Dad left Judaism and got married to my Mom and they became Jewish Christians.\n\nSo your Dad left Judaism and your Mom isn't Jewish.\n\n>They wouldn't even count my brother for the prayer quorom and chose to use a random person they called instead.\n\nMaybe because he's not Jewish?\n\n>I don't see why I can't honor my aunt in a way that's meaningful to me, in a way that's special for us and the specific relationship we had.\n\nBecause it's disrespectful to her culture and religion?\n\nYTA.", "ESH  They made it clear it's not appropriate to lay flowers.

That's the distinction between different Christian groups and Messianics vs. Judaism. It's not a matter of different theology or structure, it's two different religions. Messianism is a Christian offshoot, not a Jewish one. I have no issues with Christians, just those who claim that their beliefs are in any way a representation of the Jewish religion.\n\nIsraeli/Jewish treatment of Ethiopian Jewry was terrible. It's not the topic at hand and is not comparable to the situation with Messianic Judaism, which started around fifty years ago. It's not a continuing line from early Jewish Christian sects. When those sects stopped being Jewish is a matter of debate in scholarly and/or religious circles that's way above my ability to debate, but by three hundred or so years later what was established was certainly not Jewish anymore. Not Rabbinic Judaism and not Second Temple Judaism. Messianism and it's tenants would not be recognizable to early Jewish Christian sects, no matter what they like to claim.", "Again, they should've told OP that. Someone groups do and some don't.", "The problem with this is, for example, Catholics believe that Protestants violated fundamental tenets of Christianity. Many Shia Muslims believe that Sunni Muslims violated fundamental tenets of Islam, and vice versa. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP just \u201cdecided she\u2019s Jewish one day\u201d. She comes from an Orthodox family. Even though she now holds a belief that most other Jews consider equivalent to apostasy, her roots go pretty deep.", "I don't know much about Islam, so I can't comment on that, but it's not comparable to the divisions between Protestants and Catholics. \n\nThe disagreement between Protestants and Catholics is over theological differences. It revolves around doctrine, Church structure, and religious practices, but they don't negate the core beliefs that define someone as Christian. Different Jewish denominations have similar differences amongst them. Messianic beliefs fundamentally conflict with core Jewish beliefs. It's not the same as denomination vs denomination, it's quite literally two different religions. \n\nRegarding OP's Jewish identity, it is undeniable that she has Jewish heritage and she feels a strong connection to it. But the determination of who is considered Jewish is established by the Jewish community itself. No Jewish denomination would recognize her as Jewish without conversion. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have specific requirements for patrilineal Jews, and Orthodoxy only holds matrilineal descent. Her belief in Jesus as the Messiah places her outside the boundaries of Judaism.\n\nThe concept of Messianic Judaism, or that you can combine Judaism with Christianity is also so incredibly disrespectful to our ancestors and the history of Jewish persecution and suffering at the hands of Christians over the past two thousand years. It is especially wrong considering that the origins of the movement were rooted in evangelical attempts to convert Jews. There are multiple instances of Messianics infiltrating Jewish communities with the intention of converting Jewish folks in the last year alone. \n\nIt doesn't help that Messianics intentionally disrespect Jewish rules and customs while claiming to be Jewish. OP has given two examples in this thread of violating pretty universal Jewish norms. As I said, this is par for the course with Messianics. They have no desire to be a part of the Jewish community, just steal the parts of our customs and rules that suit them, and disregard or outright make fun of the rest. \n\nJudaism is a closed religion, while Christianity is more open. Judaism does not dictate what others should believe, nor does it claim that one must be Jewish to have a relationship with G-d. However, it does ask for respect for the boundaries and definitions established by the Jewish community. \n\nEdit: I word vomited and cleaned it up lol"]}
