She has always been a bit of an attention seeker, there have been many instances where something exiting or upsetting has happened to someone and while everyone is celebrating or comforting them she would pull some kind of stunt to make it about her. For example on my 12th birthday, just as everyone was singing happy birthday to me she began to cry, claiming she was upset because I had been mean to her earlier in the day and she wanted to go home. I tried to explain to my mom that this wasn't the case as I had barely spoken to her at all that day, my mom instantly came to her defense, claiming she would never lie. Over the years I've gotten used to her antics and usually just roll my eyes and move on knowing there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nLast Saturday my family came to my house for a family gathering. As we were all talking my brother (15M) suddenly passed out, everyone began to panic, immediately trying to help him. After a few minutes he regained consciousness, he was still pretty out of it, everyone was making sure he was okay and trying to figure out what caused the episode when my cousin suddenly burst into tears, talking about how scared she was and how awful the experience was, even getting mad at my family for panicking so much and claiming they scared her. Instantly, all the attention was on her again and my brother even attempted to go over to see if she was okay. I say attempted because he almost passed out again the moment he tried to stand up, (I had to grab onto him to stop him from collapsing) but of course nobody noticed because everyone was paying attention to my cousin. This honestly pissed me off so much, my cousin was yet again taking all the attention, however this time it wasn't just on a special occasion, this was a serious medical situation. I began to yell at her, I told her that my brother could have been seriously hurt and she as usual was commanding all of the attention, and not everything had to be about her. This just made her cry even harder and she ended up having a full on meltdown, my mother practically had to drag me out of the room. \n\n\n\nNow almost my entire family is mad at me (except my grandma, my brother and my other cousin). At first I thought I was in the right but now I'm not sure, I may have just spoken out of worry and I feel like I should have just bit my tongue because I really upset her. \n\nWhat do you think AITA? \n\nFor all those worried about my brother and are wondering why he passed out, it turns out the absolute dumbass had forgotten to eat ALL DAY!

This is a pattern of behaviour that's controlling, and your family have let her get away with it using myths about us. (Yes, autistic people can lie! What a surprise!)\n\nIf this was a one-off event, I'd be inclined to believe that her reaction was a real showing of emotions. However, seeing as she's lied to get attention on her before, I cannot believe that this is anything other than her wanting to be the focus of everyone's attention.\n\nI cannot believe that she wasn't in control of her actions, because if she wasn't, then other incidents like the one where *she lied that you were mean to her* wouldn't have happened. Besides, it seems like it's always when someone else is having some attention on them. A genuine reaction would A: not happen every time someone is being celebrated/comforted/etc and B: Happen when nobody else is being focused on at least sometimes (edited to make sentence meaning clearer).\n\nAdditionally, when she does this, the entire family shouldn't switch attention to her.\n\nOn the off chance that this *was* a genuine reaction, then this is a boy-who-cried-wolf situation.

But you do not have to. Instead of getting them the help they need, they instead enable them to keep doing that shit and in the real world, that doesn\u2019t fly, autism or not. You just have to pick your battles because you already know how everyone else will react. She does too and that\u2019s why her antics work so well.

Your cousin in \"crazy like a fox\"; she's using her condition to manipulate everyone and she's very, VERY good at it. She has the entire family as well trained as Pavlov's dogs. I doubt you can change it by now, so concentrate on keeping out of her way and preparing for the moment you can leave this bunch of duped puppets.", "NTA. I think it's partially sad when children (ND or not) are coddled to this degree, where they clearly can't survive without the attention or fawning... *but* at a certain point it is just worthy of eye rolls. Which is the case here.\n\nShe's 17 - adulthood is going to be brutally unkind to her, and the longer she's coddled, the longer she'll remain an attention seeking child, which will be very pathetic (or more so) when she's a full blown adult. Your family is setting her up for failure.\n\nSidenote: Remind your brother to also drink water in addition to never forgetting to eat.

As far as your family whatever their reasoning for enabling her, they\u2019re likely too narcissistic to ever admit they were wrong to do it. That or their guilt towards her condition will never allow them to see the damage they\u2019ve caused. If I were you I\u2019d focus on your grades, put all of your energy into getting into college. If they won\u2019t pay (which I don\u2019t foresee them paying anyway) get loans and go as far away as you can. The furthest school possible, and distance yourself.

Your brother was not ok and she was making the situation worse. \n\nI'm not going to make a judgement on your cousin because I do not know the extent of where she falls on the spectrum, but the adults failed all of you. Your cousin has had zero people actually attempting to correct bad behaviors that will hinder her into adulthood. The other children in your generation have been forced to tolerate frequent disruptive behaviors, even dampening celebrations of them. And with this latest incident, you had a minor having a medical issue and she was distracting while attention needed to be on the child in distress.\n\nHer parents need to either teach her better behavior or remove her from inappropriate situations if she is truly not capable. If she is not capable and her parents weren't there, the adults in charge needed to remove her", "NTA. I am mildly autistic. So is my daughter.  We can mask relatively easily. My son on the other hand struggles. He covers his ears at bangs his head. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s a boy, maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s younger, I dunno. But the same rules apply to him as anyone else. For example if he attends a birthday party, the rule is the birthday kid blows out the candles. He doesn\u2019t get a turn for being autistic. The only accomodations we make for him is we make sure he\u2019s not put into situations where he feels overstimulated which could trigger meltdowns. If he melts we leave early. Everything is 3 times harder, we have to plan everything in advance and talk him through it all so nothing surprises him. \n\nWhat your cousin is exhibiting isn\u2019t autism. It\u2019s main character syndrome.", "NTA. It\u2019s difficult to tell if this is really about autism or it\u2019s just a personality defect.

It might give you some perspective.", "As an autistic person, ~~Y T A for yelling at her~~, but overall NAH\n\nEdit: I think that you're NTA for yelling in that situation, I more meant you'd be an ah if you held a grudge against her for something that is out of her control. Your family are ah for immediately shifting their attention to her, rather than your brother. \n\nOp's cousin doing asshole things unrelated to autism are never ever justified, but from what I've read a lot of her 'attention seeking' behaviours sound like her cousin misinterpreting social cues. Her family are the AH for failing to respond in a way which accommodates everyone's needs.\n\nSorry if I got my point across poorly or seemed too harsh!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you don't fully understand autism and how it effects the person. You seem to be labelling her behaviours in a way which makes sense for your (presumably) neurotypical brain.\n\nFor example: What you see as attention seeking due to the timing is most likely a response to the situation which happens immediately, as she may not be able to mask her emotions/anxiety in a situation like that, unlike how most neurotypical people tend to process their feelings internally due to social nuances.\n\nShe's autistic. She cannot help why, when, or where meltdowns happen. They are incredibly debilitating and scary. I completely appreciate how your interpretation of her emotions and reactions made it upsetting for you, ~~but you yelling at her for something out of her control is still unacceptable.~~  and it is understandable how you reacted, but continuing to blame her for how **other people** respond to her meltdowns, which **she cannot control,** would be unfair. \n\nAll I'd recommend is doing a little bit more research on autism, and think before you attribute a specific emotion/reaction to your interpretation of what it is, if that makes sense!", "You were under a lot of pressure with your brother passing out, but unfortunately YTA. You shouted at her when she was clearly upset and you caused her to have a meltdown.\n\nEdit: surprised with the downvotes - an autism diagnosis often comes with an inability to cope in highly charged situations just like the ones described. Attributing \"attention seeking\" as the reason for the behaviour based what OP has shared seems naive.", "YTA. Her response is the result of her medical condition. Why would you expect her to not respond to stress? The hallmark of her condition is that she *cannot* synthesize stress as someone else does. Its not she just doesn't want to. \n\nIts not about her being attention seeking. Its all about her medical condition, which is a neurological, as well as developmental disorder. So, again YTA.  She's not you and she's not like you.", "Esh, your family shouldn't make her the centre of attention every time she gets upset, and you shouldn't have shouted at her", "I understand why you were upset and emotions were high, but I\u2019d say yeah YTA", "[deleted]", "YTA. There are better ways to communicate. You clearly lack communication skills. You were unable to control your temper, and inflicted it on a vulnerable person. Why should everyone have to put up with your lack of control and bad temper? Stop being entitled to be out of control and justify hurting someone, which only makes the situation worse.", "Why would not eating for a day cause you to pass out?\n\nNTA btw", "NAH. You\u2019re justified in being upset- it just sounds like you\u2019re actually upset at your family rather than her herself. She takes attention away in the blink of an eye, yes, but it\u2019s because your family doesn\u2019t delegate on who should help her in the moment and who should stay involved in the existing situations. But- it does sound like you don\u2019t completely understand how autism makes dealing with stress in any way other than a meltdown near impossible. Add that in with the high sensory situations and no wonder she broke down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was emotional, is a teenager, and her brother was (at least to her eyes), in big danger, as much as autistic people can't control their reaction to certain things, I'd say the same goes for neurotypical people in such situations.", "I agree that she could have been more sensitive but keep in mind this was a scared 16 year old girl that was worried about her brother, this isn't a fully grown adult who completely understands autism, I can understand how her behavior may come off as attention seeking to someone who doesn't fully understand it, especially for a 16 year old.", "Easy you don't focus on the disorder.

All we all really want is to be treated with respect and not be treated like idiots. Op NTA IM REALLY GETTING FRIGGING SICK OF PEOPLE USING AUTISM AS AN EXCUSE. It's NOT. STOP BABYING YOUR KIDS.

He works one day a week and plans stuff around it. Yes, he needs more help. But you know what his family isn't doing EXCUSING BAD BEHAVIOR.  I had tantrums until I was about 10. PEOPLE PLEASE WAKE UP. Just like LGBTQ+, all anyone wants is RESPECT and equal rights and to be treated LIKE HUMANS.
