They've been divorced for the past 11 years. \n\nWhile my mom (34F) moved on from the divorce, my dad (37M) never really did. He had a few short term girlfriends but he remained extremely obsessed with my mom. He always interrogated me about who she was dating, if she had any new male friends and just weird shit like that. He'd always tell me that him and my mother belonged together and it was only a matter of time before they reconciled. When I was a kid, I'd believe him because it was my dream for them to reconcile, but my mother would always tell me that while she cared about my dad a lot, they were better off as friends.\n\nMy mom had been engaged to a man called Eric (43M) for the past 4 years. A few weeks ago, she found out he had cheated on her and she is devastated. Funnily enough, it was actually my dad who found out that Eric was cheating because my dad went to a bar and found Eric there with another woman. This is the only reason I know what happened because if my mom found out herself, she probably wouldn't have told me. Before this though, my dad always hated Eric (he was actually a decent guy) and any mention of him in my dad's presence was guaranteed to ruin his mood.\n\nEric's infidelity really depressed my mom and she's taken time off work and spends most of her time in her bed. My grandparents and uncle have been coming over regularly to check that she's okay. She's struggled with her mental health most of her life so the whole family knows she needs a bit of extra support at this time.\n\nHowever, my dad is trying to capitalize on this situation. Every time I come home from school, I find a bouquet a flowers from him for her in the house. He comes over for dinner everyday now and he's always flirting with her. On Friday when I came from school, he called me to say that he had ordered dessert for my mom and I and when it arrived, hers was covered in hearts. I obviously want my mom to be happy and I can see this is making her happy, but she literally just came out a long relationship and given her mental health, it uncomfortable that my dad's swooped in on this situation to try get her to get back with him instead of trying to make sure she's okay because they share a kid.\n\nOn Saturday, he told me he was planning to take her out for valentine's but he hadn't told her yet, and we got into an argument. I was basically asking him to give her a few months to heal so she can make a decision that's right for her and he called me evil for not wanting them to get back together. I ended up calling him a creep and I left to go back to my mom's house. He's now demanding that I apologize to him because I had no right to insult him for 'wanting his family back together' and for trying to make 'the woman he loves feel better'.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676288319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111680h/aita_for_calling_my_dad_a_creep/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I highly suggest talking to your mother about how your fathers actions and seeing how it makes her feel. Secondly, it sounds like you need to set some boundaries with your father. He needs to stop using you to get the details on your mother.", "NTA using your mother's vulnerability to swoop in and take advantage of the situation is a super gross thing to do. \n\nIf your dad doesn't want to be called a creep, he should probably stop acting like one.", "NTA but I suggest you don\u2019t put yourself in the middle of this any more than you have to. It sounds like you have extended family around right now, and they have more knowledge of the current situation and also whatever situation caused your parents to split to begin with. They can step in and protect your mom when she needs protecting.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to think he\u2019s a creep and tell him so. And it does sound creepy to me. But you don\u2019t need to be your mom\u2019s knight in shining armor.", "And that is why we should stop romanticizing stalking/harassment and stop calling it \"pursuing\". A no should have been more than enough for your dad to stop. He is creepy, stalking and harassing her, and actively trying to use (weaponize?) her mental health issue to manipulate her and for his happiness. He doesn't care about her mental health issue, he is trying to use it, which is egoistical, alarming, dangerous, and morally absolutely not okay. This is extremely predatory and 100% manipulation.\n\nEdit: nta of course", "NTA your dad is acting incredibly suspect and borderline entitled and obsessive. Also I it's very convenient that your dad found out that Eric was cheating. Not saying he's lying just seems to be a bit convenient. Either way he's being uncaring and not giving your mum actual time to process what has happened. You were completely right in calling him out and telling him to back off a bit. But I think it is time for you to also back away from the situation as well. Being caught up within the crossfire is never a good position.", "NTA, he does sound like a creep.", "NTA. Honestly, you are right. What he is doing is both creepy and predatory.", "NTA, but please do talk to an adult about this. You sound very mature for your age so I in no way mean that as any criticism, but he does sound like he's obsessing about her and I'm concerned for any young person caught in the middle of this. I hope you can speak with a trusted adult about it because I'm worried about him escalating any behavior if he thinks he's losing his chance, so to speak.", "NTA\n\nIs there actually proof of this cheating btw? Like photos or something? \n\nSeems kinda malicious by ur dad", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unfortunately your dad sounds absolutely like a creep. Especially him using your mom\u2019s vulnerable state to make his move.

Your dad should back off but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much you can do other than talk to your mother about it. If it makes you fear for her, please tell a family friend or relative.
