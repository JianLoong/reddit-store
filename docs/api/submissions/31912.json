The pastor has ears.  The pastor's wife has ears. Yet they are letting their daughter distract from worship with her loud, showy (and from what you're suggesting, pitchy), awful soprano runs.  Every. Single. Service.\n\nClearly, church music is important to you.  You'd like to be a part of it.  And you don't want to feel resentful or distracted by a self-important teen who is in a position to show off (badly) week after week thanks to nepotism.\n\nGo find a church with a choir you admire.  You'll be much happier.\n\nNTA", "This is why nepotism is bad", "NTA- the pastor's daughter is being spoiled and selfish. Not a very Christian way to act. You are right, she should be letting others sing soprano. Singing in a group is people singing in their correct range. As Sister Mary Clarence said, \"I think it's probably a good idea if we bring you down out of the rafters, everybody wants to be close to God, I'm just not sure you can do it vocally, so I need you to sing an octave below where you've been singing.\"", "Sounds like an awful church, if they let a spoiled teen sing like that as a soloist!", "WWJD!? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "high notes or high stoned?\n\nshe's def not the only one who knows how to sing high.", "NAH. It's just a simple reality check. If they take offense to something like this, they're stuck up people who can only have their own way. You can always just join in on the alto melodies, but if you're in a scenario where a comment that's literally common knowledge creates bad blood between you, then they're assholes.\n\nIt's ok for a teenager to want attention, it's ok to want your kid to be the center of attention and it's ok not to want to play along some contrived way of shielding someone's teenage daughter from the fact that other people can be special just like her. She's 15, not 5.", "Esh. Sounds like youre both losing focus of what the point of worship is. Its not for attention or to soft launch your music career in the community. You both seem like you want attention instead of connecting with the lord. Just have a mature conversation with the other adults that lead worship. If they dont change then maybe its not the church for you", "I feel like you could have just said, \u201cI normally sing soprano.\u201d", "NTA - As a longtime church goer, I\u2019ve definitely experienced this kind of worship team girl. They really make it all about them when their job is to lead music and help the congregation sing and worship. I don\u2019t think you were mean at all- you didn\u2019t even call out her Mariah Carey nonsense. But I do think you should hold your ground about singing soprano/melody. This girl is 15 and will hopefully get over herself if someone else steps into the spotlight and won\u2019t be her backup singer.", "ESH\n\nThe daughter was rude. You were rude in response. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have tension with anybody.\u201d Too late.\n\nThe pastor\u2019s wife should have asked your range, but isn\u2019t an AH for not doing so.\n\nAlso, just curious, how bad is she? I\u2019m picturing Kathy Najimy\u2019s character singing up the octave at full volume in Sister Act until told to bring it back down.", "Show what you got and allow the process to happen.", "YTA she is a teenager. Yes, she's being a bit bratty, but why are you stooping to that level? \n\nBoth if you are losing sight of what this choir is supposed to be about. It is not about being the \"star.\" You are there to worship. Not a very Christian attitude.", "ESH\n\nQuite frankly you both sounded like you love to be the center of attention. I don't know if either of you actually do love it, but you surely sounded like that. \n\nYeah, apologizing for the way you said that would surely make you look better and rid you of the feeling that you too would love to be the center of attention.", "ESH", ">everything we do is for God.\n\nLol, obviously there is more than a little ego there too!", "YTA you were told which part you'd be singing. And honestly, it sounds like you're comparing yourself against this kid which is a bit weird.", "Mild YTA\n\nLook it sounds like the worship team is somewhat a family affair, which as you pointed out, is going to take time to really \"break in\" with, especially at important holidays or services e.g. Christmas, Easter. The pastor's daughter seems to be distracting to other parishioners, too, so I don't think you are in the wrong for wanting to try to smooth the situation out. And I do get the church worship in some places is pretty high-key and quality, where there's an opportunity to go beyond traditional worship gatherings. \n\nI don't think you were wrong with suggesting you can sing a range of parts, but you overstepped. You would naturally have many opportunities to show your range and singing ability in worship team, but you were new. You should have let yourself seem humble (even if you don't always feel that way) and your talent would obviously shine out. \n\nTeenagers (especially pastor kids) have it rough, which is probably why she is acting out / trying to be the center of attention. Your singing would have gently guided her, perhaps, to tone down, but it will be hard for her to see past your own pride in future.\n\nI'd apologize, happily sing the alto Christmas parts, and look for times to shine over time. \n\nLike that verse in Matthew: \"Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house. Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\" Your talent will come through and you don't need to draw attention to it unnecessarily.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It can be simple, like \"I'm sorry I said that the other day -- must have had too much spice in my latte! I think you sound great - loved the way you handled \\[insert recent song here\\].\" Though don't lie ha :)\n\nAnd if you do that little extra mile during set up and break down, for example, I'm sure I'll all blow over just fine.", "Maybe they shouldn\u2019t let the Mariah wannabe impact parishioners negatively by scream singing at them so she can be the center of attention. Mezzo is between alto and soprano, and it\u2019s more difficult to force a lower singing range than it is to sing within your comfortable range, as OP\u2019s range is soprano to mezzo soprano. The person who wants to add dramatic flair to their singing should either take a step back from the dramatics and attention grabbing, or let someone else lead the singing for that vocal range."]}
