It was a woman I had never met, but she knew a few of my existing employees and liked the schedule we have.\nThroughout my interview with her, I asked lots of common questions. (\"Why are you interested in this position?\" \"\"Where would you like to be in 5 years?\" \"What professional goals do you have?\" \"What's you're availability?\") Almost every answer incorporated, \"Well, I'm a mom.\" As if this was the perfect explanation.\n\nShe revealed her kids are school age and her husband wants her to go back to work. She wants to use her brain (her words) and she has time during the day (\"but [she's] a mom.\") Finally, towards the end of the interview I curtly explained, \"I get it. You're a mom. I have a one year old and a two year old. What I'm asking is...\" And restructured my final question to give her a chance to provide more relevant information. \n\nShe interviewed with other parts of the team who all said, \"She's nice. I like her.\" As the hiring supervisor, I have the final call. I won't hire her because she tanked the interview by talking only about her personal life. The team told me that's an asshole move, everyone has life outside of work. I assume because it's their friend. \nA close coworker privately suggested that I'm being an asshole to this mom reentering the workforce because I resent stay at home moms. *Eye-roll* \nListen. I don't care if you have kids or not. as someone with kids, and the boss of many people who are parents - I just care that you can do the job. We work in healthcare. Nothing she said led me to believe that she's a team player or even genuinely interested in doing the job, other than it might meet her scheduling demands. In my experience, someone that uses \"I have kids\" as an excuse generally believes their time or schedule is more important than those without kids, and that's not okay.\n\nAgain, I have young kids and I understand prioritizing family and setting healthy boundaries for balance in your life. BUT if you can't put your family out of your mind for a one hour interview to talk about this job, I don't have faith that you can adequately focus on your patients for an entire shift. My employees are making me think I'm an asshole for blocking a mom (their friend) from a job that meets her needs, but  I feel that I've done my employees a favor by not letting this person become their coworker. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I did not give my team details on my decision other than I don't think she's the best fit. All documentation of the interview was professional. No laws or HR policies were broken in the area where I live. Anything I said about this person to my team, is something I am comfortable saying to the candidate.", "created_utc": 1675905309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xh3i5/aita_for_not_hiring_a_woman_because_shes_a_mom/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell, I'd be reconsidering whether I wanted to continue working there!", "ESH not hiring someone because they are a mom is illegal in many places. If your argument is that she failed the interview, fine. You needed to articulate that to the team. Everyone is rightfully upset based on the reasoning you provided them, and you may have done irreparable damage to your image and reputation.\n\nI think it is worth trying to understand her situation here too. Unfortunately women often have to take on the vast majority of childcare. Her identity for the last several years has probably been as a mom. She may have failed to show the traits you were looking for in the interview though.\n\n Rather than being curt at the end of the interview, perhaps explain that her being a mom cannot be considered in the hiring decision and pushed to get her to better explain how she would be an asset. You are looking for the best person for a role, not the best interviewer.", "Yea. You're an asshole lol", "YTA You are a man, yes? She's probably grappling with her identity after \"just\" being a SAHM. Trying to justify her very existence. It's a very humbling experience to get back into the workforce. She's likely to be a decent candidate, as multitasking and crisis mitigation are her wheelhouse. She is driven by something other than just money.", "NTA", "NTA - But you kind of suck for the misleading title. It\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t hire her \u201cbecause she\u2019s a mom\u201d, you didn\u2019t hire her because she bombed the interview and you\u2019re not confident that she can do the job. Your fellow colleagues are upset because you aren\u2019t hiring their friend. If you truly don\u2019t think she\u2019s a proper fit for the position, do not hire her. I\u2019ve interviewed and hired many people in my life, it\u2019s a tough position to be in. I would suggest watching how you word your decision though, you don\u2019t want to open yourself up to a lawsuit.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re looking for someone that\u2019s going to add some relevant value to the team to get the job done. If all she has to offer is \u201cI\u2019m a mom\u201d and a nice personality, that\u2019s not going to get it done anywhere. Maybe a entry level position somewhere else may work but if it don\u2019t work for you and your needs then it won\u2019t work.", "She sounds unqualified, self-absorbed and has no long-term professional goals.... I don't see how she fits into this team.\n\nI doubt patients are going to be a priority for her during work hours, she doesn't seen that interested. NTA", "The only reason she is going back to work is because her husband told her too but does she want to? No if she did she would have been better prepared for the interview. Read what the op said, she gave her a few chances for better answers. The op didn\u2019t discriminate because she is a mom, she was just not a good candidate. \n\nI would be more concerned about the rest of the people that interviewed her. Their business is healthcare, why would you hire a candidate who seemed more interested in being a mom. NTA.", "NTA... sounds like you're not hiring her because she gave a shit interview by answering all your questions with \"I'm a mom\" instead of giving legit answers", "NTA, she seems like a terrible candidate.", "NTA. But stop giving ppl too much information.  If they tell her that's why you didn't hire her, it can be seen as discrimination.  They don't need to know why you didn't hire her. Simply say, she's not the right fit etc.", "NTA based on your full text. It's not the fact that she's a mom that made you decide against hiring her, you based your decision on the fact that her responses were incomplete and limited in scope. I think it would be important for you to think about how it sounds when you say why you did not choose her as the real reason behind your decision is not discriminatory but you make it sound like it was.", "NTA. She didn't interview well. That's all you need to know", "NTA - Initially the headline had me envisioning you being sued for discrimination. You aren't not hiring her because she has kids though, you're not hiring her because her interview sounds cringy.", "Info: NTA if she wasn\u2019t giving relevant answers about the role and solely talking about being a Mom. Being \u201cnice\u201d isn\u2019t a qualification agree there and it\u2019s a stupid bit of feedback from your colleagues. As a boss it\u2019s hard to deal with people that have a lot of family commitments BUT if they\u2019re good at what they do, it doesn\u2019t ultimately matter that much. \n\nSo was it about her not elaborating enough to feel she\u2019s qualified or just because she\u2019s a Mom?", "NAH.\n\nYou interviewed a candidate and found her unsuitable, not because of her motherhood but rather the effect you felt it would have on her performance and what her bringing it up during the interview indicated to you as a hiring agent.\n\nBasically you did your job, in your professional opinion the candidate was unsuitable for the position, \"but she's a mom\" is superfluous.", "Her Husband wants her to go back to work..\nDo you think she was self sabotaging by bringing up the Mum bit repeatedly?", "NTA-you simply need to rephrase why you\u2019re not hiring her. You\u2019re not hiring her because she did not answer your interview questions in a way which lead you to believe she was either truly interested in the fundamental aspects of the job, or that she would work hard at it. None of that is untrue and frankly, it has nothing to do with being a mom. You would\u2019ve had the same issue if her response to everything was \u201cbecause, I am a dancer\u201d or \u201cbecause I like ice cream\u201d.", "NTA. It is weird that she was so determined to make sure she said to every answer \u201cWell, I\u2019m a mom.\u201d It reads to me that she was setting that up as an easy excuse to call in a lot because of something to do \u201cwith her kids\u201d. Like, one week they have a cold, another week one has an ear ache, the next week there\u2019s a doctor appointment, etc. It\u2019s like she wanted to hammer that point in so you won\u2019t ever question why she\u2019s missing a lot of work days. \n\nWork is work and home is home. It is good for a boss to be aware of who has kids for when the kids inevitably get sick or something and the worker needs to care for them, but there\u2019s a time to focus on work and a time to focus on home. \n\nI wonder if she\u2019s just playing along with her husband but isn\u2019t serious about getting a job, or else thinks working with her friends will mean she can just skate by. I\u2019m a mom myself, and I don\u2019t I would\u2019ve hired her either.", "Your reason for not hiring her can't actually be \"because she's a mom\". It would be illegal to have a policy of refusing to hire otherwise qualified people simply because they are mom.\n\nBut your reason can be because her answers didn't give information relevant to the job offering and consequently you don't know if she can do the job. \n\nNTA. But you might need to be careful documenting your reason for not hiring.", "Yeah, I think this needs to be considered. Is it OP who claimed she isn\u2019t hiring her \u201cbecause she\u2019s a mom\u201d? Or did her coworkers coin that? It weirds me out that she isn\u2019t standing her ground that this isn\u2019t about her being a mom \u2014 it\u2019s about her poor interview. \n\nHowever, to some degree, the way OP worded the title makes me think it\u2019s true. I\u2019m confused.", "Exactly. That is your answer. \n\nIt\u2019s illegal to not hire someone because they\u2019re a mum! \n\nBut someone who doesn\u2019t fit the profile of a team player is a different ball game", "No, OP's post says she *incorporated* 'I'm a mom' into her answers. She used the fact that she is a mom to explain why her answers were what they were. She didn't literally answer \"I'm a mom\" to every question.", "This. And be careful how you phrase it to ANYONE because you didn't forego hiring her because she is a parent.\n\nYou passed on hiring her because she did not present herself in a professional manner, she did not show interet in the position and she led you to believe that the only reason she was interested in the position was because of the schedule - furthermore, you had more qualified candidates.\n\nAnd, for what its worth - if a candidate told me that they are looking for a job because their husband wanted them to, that would close the book for me.\n\nI kind of think she might have intentionally sabatoged the interview.", "To add to this ESH, I'm going to point out that the OP *may* be a bit of an unreliable narrator. Also, the candidate *may* not really want a job, because she said that her husband insisted on her getting one. \n\nLots of sucking 'round here.", "This is exactly what I'm thinking, ESH. \n\nClearly OP can explain why they don't want to hire her beyond being a mom, however saying that to your employees was not only AH behavior, but also setting yourself up for a discrimination lawsuit. It's honestly not even so much assholery as two people who lacked common sense that day being put in a room together.", "I would be curious if \u201cmom\u201d was replaced with \u201cknitter\u201d if your opinion would be different - because by my understanding, OP then would not be hiring the candidate because they\u2019re a knitter, not because they\u2019re a mom. Bringing up the same characteristic regardless of the question, every time, tells me you have no personality and little to off beyond that characteristic. And nothing OP said indicated that they thought the candidate was a quality candidate otherwise.\n\nAnd before anyone mentions it, I don\u2019t hire people because I think they\u2019re nice or because I like them. That\u2019s a perk, not the goal.\n\nFor the OP, taking the post at face value, NAH - you had valid reasons for not hiring this person, but the phrasing for why may have been off, drawing valid concern from your coworkers, especially considering the candidate was friends or friendly with several existing employees.", "But that's the thing, she didn't not hire her because she's a mom, she didn't hire her because \"as a mother\".", "Totally agree with the ESH. It seems like being a mom is a personality trait instead of just a normal part of life. But yes discrimination suit waiting to happen.", "No its not its not a protected class so if in the US according to google nope she is fully in her right to not hire this women because she is a mom...oh i do think its ESH but its because everyone her has a bad attitude", "This doesn't even make sense. If she failed the interview for not actually answering questions (which is what happened), she is not being discriminated.\n\nShe wasn't rejected because she is a mom, but because she didn't show any interest for the job.\n\nNAH\n\nEDIT : OP needs to be careful on how they are wording that because if she goes around saying she rejected her because \"she is a mom\" (even if it appears that's not the case), she is setting herself up for a lawsuit and getting fired for being a shit manager.", "Yep, this is it. \n\nShe\u2019s a bad interview. Really bad from your description. \n\nI\u2019m in HR. I would expect you to be able to articulate your perfectly reasonable decision in much better terms than \u201cbecause she\u2019s a mom.\u201d If I was your HR person, I am now awaiting the EEOC charge we have to defend due to your botched explanation.", " But if OP thinks the woman wouldn\u2019t be good for the job, why is OP an AH for not hiring her?

She didn\u2019t sell herself as a person who wanted to talk about her skills or put her best foot forward by expressing that she would be a reliable employee.  She sounds like she\u2019ll be calling in every time one of her kids sniffles.", "How is incorporating that she has kids into questions about her schedule and future aspirations/career goals inappropriate? Having kids literally influences almost every decision in a person's life, including and especially career decisions.

Refusing to hire because someone is a mom is illegal. You need to rethink your decision and reframe your reasoning.

If they are married or single. And their exact age. \n\nYou can ask if they are old enough to be hired. \n\nYou can ask about gaps in a resume/work history. But you can't determine if those gaps are valid or not.
