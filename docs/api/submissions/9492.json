It was a woman I had never met, but she knew a few of my existing employees and liked the schedule we have.\nThroughout my interview with her, I asked lots of common questions. (\"Why are you interested in this position?\" \"\"Where would you like to be in 5 years?\" \"What professional goals do you have?\" \"What's you're availability?\") Almost every answer incorporated, \"Well, I'm a mom.\" As if this was the perfect explanation.\n\nShe revealed her kids are school age and her husband wants her to go back to work. She wants to use her brain (her words) and she has time during the day (\"but [she's] a mom.\" I think her subtle way of saying no evenings or weekends.) Finally, towards the end of the interview I curtly explained, \"I get it. You're a mom. I have a one year old and a two year old. What I'm asking is...\" And restructured my final question to give her a chance to provide more relevant information. \n\nShe interviewed with other parts of the team who all said, \"She's nice. I like her.\" As the hiring supervisor, I have the final call. I won't hire her because she tanked the interview by giving zero answers that helped me to understand her as a professional. The team told me it's an asshole move because she \"seems great.\"\nA close coworker privately suggested that I'm being an asshole to this mom reentering the workforce because I resent stay at home moms. *Eye-roll* \nListen. I don't care if you have kids or not. as someone with kids, and the boss of many people who are parents - I just care that you can do the job. We work in healthcare. Nothing she said led me to believe that she's a team player or even genuinely interested in doing the job, other than it might meet her scheduling demands. In my experience, someone that uses \"I have kids\" as an excuse generally believes their time or schedule is more important than those without kids, and that's not okay.\n\nAgain, I have young kids and I understand prioritizing family and setting healthy boundaries for balance in your life. BUT if you can't put your family out of your mind for a one hour interview to talk about this job, I don't have faith that you can adequately focus on your patients for an entire shift. My employees are making me think I'm an asshole for blocking a mom (their friend) from a job that meets her needs, but  I feel that I've done my employees a favor by not letting this person become their coworker. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I did not give my team details on my decision other than I don't think she's the best fit. All documentation of the interview was professional. Anything I said about this person to my team, is something I am comfortable saying to the candidate. No laws or HR policies were broken in the area where I live.", "created_utc": 1675905309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xh3i5/aita_for_not_hiring_a_woman_because_shes_a_mom/", "score": 458, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Women are a protected class. For example, if they give the job to a man with kidsafter turning her away.

Has nothing to do with whether or not the woman is a mother or not. The fact that she is a parent or not a parent doesn't affect the discrimination. There is not a federal law protecting discrimination against parents, whether it be mothers or fathers. If a father applied for the same job with the same interview and got the job, then she could sue for discrimination on the basis of being discriminated against as a woman. If the job was given to another woman who did not have kids, there is no basis for a suit in most states. \n\nThere are 2 federal laws against discriminating against pregnant women: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
