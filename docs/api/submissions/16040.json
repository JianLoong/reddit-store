His grandparents died some time ago and his parents say things like \"they are watching you from above\" Do I believe that? No. Do I need to throw that in their face?

There's a big difference between someone who wants to convert or condemn you and someone who is peacefully living their life and expressing their well wishes in a religious manner.\n\nFor example my friend praying for me is a kind gesture and I have no problem with it. However when my daughter was born a family friend learned that we didn't plan to christen her and said she'd pray for our daughter and that we'd make the right decision eventually.
