They forget you are supposed to help others and not just pray for them. As a Jew one of my favorite teachings is to pray as a theist but act as an atheist. Basically do something to help the person in need rather than waiting on God.

He went to church every Sunday and I was supportive. \n\nYears and years ago, we all went on a camping trip, and he had the hard conversation with them that he was letting go of his faith. They went on a long walk to have the conversation and his mom was devastated. For awhile it seemed like they blamed me for it.\n\nFrom then on, I got a lot more of the \"pray for you, bless you, Jesus etc\" comments. He got more than me. It was a subtle way for them to try and get us to convert back to Christianity. They thought by mentioning religion more, we'd slowly start to come back to the church. \n\nIt really just felt passive aggressive at that point. \n\nI put my foot down and for the most part they stopped with me, but they still do it to my husband pretty hard. He doesn't really care. \n\nRecently, my husband got a vasectomy. OH boy oh boy did that not go over well. They know we weren't going to have kids but always told us that God will make it happen when we're ready. I have no idea why he even told them about the vasectomy. But he got one because birth control was hard on my body and contributing to my depression. I explained that to them and I just got a, \"If birth control is hard on you then you need to take it as a sign that it's God's will that you have children.\"\n\nI understand that they 'meant' well.. but what if I wanted kids and I couldn't have them? Is that God's will too? I just think it's kind of a fucked up thing to say to someone. \n\nThe reason I am no longer religious is because my best friend had juvenile Huntington's disease, and I couldn't accept that people would say shit like, \"disease is God's will\" and what not. What God does that to a kid? Anyway, that's part of the reason when I hear, \"God's will,\" I get instantly pissed off, even though I know people mean well.\n\nAfter the whole vasectomy thing, I get a lot more religious texts from my MIL. She even texts me prayers and then a little blurb about why it's relevant in her life. For the most part it doesn't bother me. I get annoyed because I'm well aware it's her way of trying to \"convert\" me and \"save our souls.\" She 100% believes that we are going to hell.
