It\u2019s such a non issue", "NTA. \n\nYour coworkers are out of line.", "NTA you\u2019re coworkers can still call you by your given name. It\u2019s just a name tag when I worked retail and forge my name badge I used to just take one that someone left at the register. The only people who actually pay attention to name badges are the ones looking to harass you or report you", "NTA, your manager is TA for allowing these kinds of customers to continue patronizing your store.", "NTA. Most jobs ask if you have a preferred name. This just happens to be yours.", "NTA. I worked in HR and had a team member with a unique name. We worked in a predominantly white area and he was only one of two black employees we had. There's also a lot of older people in that area so when they'd see his name they would make comments. Usually not inappropriate persay but the constant questioning was getting to him. I freely offered him whatever name he wanted to put on his name tag. Your coworkers can still call you by your name, I can't imagine they're saying your name so often a customer is picking up on it. This has nothing to do with your coworkers.", "NTA. You are protecting yourself.", "Nta, I was Craig for 6 weeks at one of the jobs I worked because that was the only tag they had. Pretty interesting to have to deal with conversations with drunk people who insisted I looked like a Craig.", "I use a fake name on Facebook because my patients were trying to friend me or send me messages about their medication. I've got quite a unique name so it's pretty easy to search for. I originally just deleted everything but then I made this profile because FB is a good way to organise board game nights\n\nAbsolutely NTA and if your colleagues are smart they'd follow your example", "NTA,  I've rarely had my actual first name on my name tag. I also had a policy at a pizzaria I worked at to not have real names of our employees, due to the  area we were in (not a terrible area, just more industrial).  The owner had implemented a name tag policy to seem more \"friendly\".  A month later the owner made his regular store visit and was less than happy about my not real name policy.  It took about 3 seconds for every woman there to refuse his want for me to redo the name tags.", "NTA\nWhy do they care about your name tag???", "NTA ignore your coworkers, if you feel safer that way, go for it.", "NTA.  Safety first.  Nothing wrong with using a false name on name tag as long as it sounds professional.", "NTA \n\nYou are protecting yourself. There is nothing remotely AH'ish about that.", "I worked for the Canadian government, specifically the Canada Revenue Agency at a call center. They allowed people to use a name other than your real one for safety issues. Most people didn\u2019t, but the CRA saw the reasoning behind not wanting to use your own name. NTA.", "NTA but maybe have your manager offer them the same?", "Great idea.  Your coworkers complaints are weird!  They already know you by your name so you shouldn\u2019t do this? ????  What does one thing have to do with the other.", "I had a boss that asked all his employees if they wanted a different name for their name tags since it cut down on people calling asking if Roxy was working tonight since they clearly don\u2019t actually know Jenny.   Do it.", "My first name is pretty unique, even with just my first they'd be able to look me up on social media (there's a few others with the name but it's small enough they could match the photo to me in a few seconds). I've had 2 people find me from tinder before (that only has a first name) so it's necessary I use my nickname. \n\nMy coworkers always preferred it too since my name is a bit long.", "A tex-mex chain near me assigns all the servers cowboy names. It's a cute way to be on theme and protects them", "We had a customer at work we had to call the cops on. He repeatedly asked for my name. I didn't tell him, and I'm glad I wasn't wearing a name tag at the time because I'm afraid he would have looked me up or something. Customers don't need to know your name. NTA.", "I was 16 or 17 and constantly had a 30ish year old come in to the shoe store I worked at to get my number. He would come in like 2-3 times a week.", "I\u2019m binging this show right now and was going to say the same thing lol.", "Yeah I worked cust svc for a major bank back in the 90\u2019s and we were encouraged to use an alias. I changed my 1st name slightly and chopped my married name in half. Think Karen,Carrie, cara, Cora, Keira and thorndike becoming Thorne. Ppl should not have to provide a full name, esp for direct contact jobs like stores.", "This was my thought. I worked at a place that just had a bucket of name tags in the break room. It didn't matter which one you grabbed as long as you had one on when the shift started.", "I did that before i got married. Then i got married, and stopped wearing rings. But i mention my husband enough that people know better xD", "I think a lot of people can't tell the difference between \"unfair\" and \"I don't like it\". Or maybe it's that OP only learned their name once and they have to learn OP's twice? Can really hear the sand grinding in those gears turning.", "Wooo buddy. You must be super flexible with that reach you just pulled off.", "It seems you lost your brain sometime before making that comment", "At one of mine I had a name tag that said my name was Travis", "When I worked in a video store as a teenager, we just had blank name tags that we put our names on using a label maker. None of us had our actual legal names on them after creeps would call the store asking for female employees by name (this was before the social media age). Our coworkers knew our names, the customers had no reason to know them.", "Honestly, this is a tactic that a lot of people use, especially in retail and food service... Had I realized earlier in my life I would have gone with a \"stage name \" for using when I was working. I encourage the people I work with, especially the younger ladies in my employ, to use a stage name when customers ask rather than their real name.\n\nNTA at all!", "NTA, OP. If this action by the company opens you up to people intruding into your personal life, you are well within your rights to request this small accommodation. Heck, I stopped using my real name on Facebook when work contacts tried to \"friend\" me. Bet you anything, once the dust settles, some of your colleagues will start copying you!", "was this around the alex from target phenomenon? I always thought it was very strange", "Yup - I've been married for a lot of years, rarely wear my rings (I have THREE sets of wedding rings, long story), and still apparently give off the \"don't mess with me, I'm married\" vibe...", "There was a show called Signal and they showed serial killers murdering lonely women and retail shop depressed ladies. Watching it made me really scared about these kinda crazy people.", "Back in the stone age when I was a teenager, I asked the store manager if my name tag could have a different name on it and he agreed.  All the female employees decided to do the same thing.  The manager said that our \"new\" name had to have the same first initial as our real name, and it worked out great.  Mine is an \"A\" name, and I used Audrey.  We had another female employee with an \"A\" name different form mine, and she used Alison.  \n\nLater on, that same manager came up with the idea that we would all provide him with a code word.  If someone came in asking about us or called asking about us, if they didn't know our real name AND the code word, no information was given at all.  It gave us all some peace of mind.", "The hospital used to print our full names on our badges. We used tape to cover our last names. Yoy can look up licenses on the state website with our full name and get our home address and everything. Scary.", "What a fabulous manager! Ours at the video store never enforced the \"you must use your name when answering the phone\" rule because of creeps as well. I haven't worked for her since 2004 but she was so awesome that we're still in touch."]}
