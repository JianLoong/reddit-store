You're looking for a way to avoid creeps and your manager is okay with that.  It's very disturbing that you've dealt with that many creepy guys in a retail setting.", "NTA at all. I\u2019ve had two specific customers who for one reason or another really irked me (one had even asked me out). The shift supervisors would always find excuses for me to be in the back any time either walked in and honestly having management side with you like that is awesome. I\u2019m glad they have your back even if your coworkers don\u2019t", "NTA. I don't get the \"unfair because they know your name\"? Huh? You didn't ask THEM to call you anything. And also, if it's a big deal to them, then you have set a very useful precedent, if it's not a big deal to them, then they should be ok with you getting a name tag, since it IS  a big deal to you. \"You need to suffer like we do\" is... I don't know what it is, but it makes you NTA.", "NTA. \n\nI work in a customer facing job and in fact encourage my employees to use a nickname. It's just safer.", "Former retail worker here.  I swear, name tags are the devil's tool.  Just because some drunken sot can read my name, they think I owe them something now.  And people like that do not take no for an answer.  I can't tell you how many times I had to send a page to my favourite police officers to get a dude to leave.  \n\nYou do what you have to do to protect yourself.  As for the co-workers being snotty about it, offer to introduce them to the lovely gents who won't leave you alone.  \n\nNTA", "yes omg i love superstore and frankly amy was a genius for that. i\u2019d totally do it too if i worked retail", "Im so sorry about your experiences. I did, also, stopped wearing a name tag because I was being stalked on social media. I find it atrocious that employees are not entitled to their own privacy. If I were you, I would report this incompetent management of yours asap. It cannot go unnoticed.", "My last food service job, all management both on store level and our district GM were women which was pretty cool. It was technically company policy to wear name tags but they did away with them due to customer harassment.\n\nNow in my career as a hairstylist, it\u2019s a legal requirement that we have to have our cosmetology license on display which has our full name and address on it. It\u2019s commonplace to black out the address because the only important information is the name and the active dates if we were inspected by the State Board.", "I\u2019m all for rocking that boat loudly!\n\nI have my niece yell at men who comment at her \u201cI\u2019m 13 you predator. Go away\u201d", "Yeah, or crab in a bucket. OP's trying to get out of the bucket but they just want to pull her back down to be stuck with them.", "Your niece is my new hero.", "My daughter noticed when men looked at my a$$. We were at McDonald\u2019s & I was ordering for us while she stood back playing on her phone. Out of no where I hear, \u201cBOO! Stop staring at MY moms butt!!\u201d I turn around & the guy in question was a 6\u20194 or 5 Black guy in a Security Guard uniform. And I looked from him to her & then I grinned & said, \u201cThank you sweetie.\u201d \ud83e\udd23 \n\nLegit was hysterical since I\u2019m 5\u20195 & my daughter is like 5\u20192.  She has a sweet angelic face but DAMN at that moment? That guy should have shrunk a few feet. \ud83e\udd23", "> We used tape to cover our last names.\n\nReminded of a Ted Lasso plot point. Soccer team does that to cover up the logo of a sponsor doing shady stuff", "I agree.  I don't know how they do it now, but this was back in the late 80s and seemed practically unheard of elsewhere."]}
