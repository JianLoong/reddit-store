My husband (36M) and I (34F) have 3 kids (8, 6, & 3).  We live 3 blocks from the school our 2 oldest kids attend.  Most days, I will walk there with our youngest and walk them home after school.  But some days I can't make that work and they walk home by themselves.  \n\nOur next door neighbor is an elderly man who is not nice.  He's yelled at all members of my family at some point since we've moved in.  We try to avoid him at all costs.  A few weeks ago, my 2 kids were walking home from school and cut through the corner of our neighbor's yard instead of following the sidewalk all the way to our driveway.  I later went out and checked and could see their footprints in the snow, they maybe crossed 10-15 feet of his yard before getting to ours.  \n\nHe screamed at them.  I mean, top of his lungs screaming.  I heard him from inside.  I walked out and my 2 kids were frozen and clearly scared.  He was yelling at them to stay off his property and if he catches them in his yard again they will regret it.  I told my kids to go inside and tried to defuse the situation.  All my neighbor wanted to do was yell and I went inside after he said that my kids will be lucky if all he does is call the cops next time they trespass on his property.  \n\nFast forward to last week and we mistakenly got a package delivered to our house that was meant to be delivered to our neighbor.  My husband wanted to walk it over to him and give it to him.  But I reminded him of what he said to our kids and how he yelled at me.  I told my husband the best thing we could do is return it to the sender and let them take care of it.  It's not worth the trouble of dealing with our neighbor, even if it's the easy thing to do.  \n\nA couple days later, a man about my age knocked on our door.  He said he was our neighbor's son and that he thinks a package of medication was accidentally delivered to our house.  I told him that yes, a package meant for his dad was delivered to us, but that we had it returned to sender.  He asked why we didn't just bring it over to his dad and I told him his dad threatened police action if we ever stepped foot on his property again.\n\nHe said that the package had medication in it that his dad desperately needs and now he has to go without it for who knows how long.  He said all we had to do was walk 50 feet from our front door.  I told him I wasn't going to risk anything bad happening given the last interaction we had with his dad.  \n\nHe said that without that medicine, his dad is at a very serious health risk.  I told him I'm sorry to hear that, but he will need to contact someone else to find out when the package will be delivered.  He told me that seems like a very petty thing to do on my part and that I put his dad's health at risk over nothing.  \n\nI do feel bad that the package had medicine in it, but I also feel that's not my problem given our last interaction.", "created_utc": 1683666548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d63wf/aita_for_returning_a_package_to_sender_instead_of/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It absolutely could have been medications.", "I mean, I don't. Lots of Medicare/Medicaid plans require, or at least heavily incentivize, the use of their in-house mail-order pharmacies.

It's a very minor incursion at best.", "Considering in this country arrive at the point where old men shoot children like turkeys at thanksgiving for driving into wrong driveway, buzzing wrong door. I think it\u2019s time to relax a little bit. It\u2019s not like they step on his flower beds. We all have cut a corner here and there. Everything has to be proportionate to the offense not blown out of proportion.", "Hmmm. Have you seen the news lately where crotchety old men have been shooting people for \"petty\" reasons?! People have been shot to death for minor reasons. OP did what she needed to do to remain safe. She's not responsible for that man's life. His son could always get the medicine delivered to his house, get a post office box, or have the meds signed for instead of unsigned deliveries.

The package literally looks exactly like the white, plastic envelopes that Amazon also uses. \nSecondly, if it's meds in blister packs (not loose in a container), you wouldn't *hear* the meds rustle in the bag.\nLastly, caremark (and I'm pretty sure any other mail-order pharmacy), only print the warehouse address on the label, they do not indicate that the package originated from a pharmacy.", "True, but at the same time medication someone desperately needs should not be reliant on mail delivery...", "That's correct. **Everyone** here sucks, to their own degrees.\n\nWell, maybe not the husband.", "> We all have cut a corner here and there\n\nSpeak for yourself; I don't even cut across parking lots.", "I agree he could be the biggest person too, but it's obvious he is the problem. They could have simply set the package at the end of his walk and not even entered his property. It could have been a learning moment for her kids. Maybe it could have been a turning point in how he treats them. Instead now even the old man's kid probably hates them.", "You realize that some Medicare drug plans require mail order pharmacies? Right. She didn\u2019t even have to take it to his door. Just shove it in the mailbox. OP is YTA", "I also get prescriptions by mail. And I've also lost prescriptions in the mail. You can bet your ass if I desperately needed the medication I would definitely not rely on the mail for delivery.... And, if I had to rely on the mail, I'd make sure I'd have sufficient supply to account for things like this.\n\nIt's not OPs responsibility to account for an A-hole neighbor's lack of foresight.", "People are bing murdered in the US for being in someone\u2019s driveway. It used to be far fetched that a neighbor dispute turns into gun violence.", "It's actually illegal for anyone other than USPS carriers to put things in mailboxes.", "First off, doing that is a fairly serious crime. Maybe actually know what you're talking about before giving advice.\n\nSecond, people have been getting shot for just going near people's homes lately, and this loser already threatened her children.", "Thank you this is what I was trying to say. It is very clear that these are meds when they arrive. there is nothing in the post that would indicate that OP knew that and sent them back anyway. \nI think the son was exaggerating this fact because he knows his dad is an AH", "And it\u2019s not a misdemeanor. It\u2019s a federal charge for tampering with mail and mailboxes."]}
