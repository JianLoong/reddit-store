I actually went and bought all the ingredients for this, which was about $200. \n\nSo earlier this week (the event is Monday on the 3-day weekend), she told me her husband cancelled the plans he made with his friends so he could stay for the party because it \u201csounded more fun\u201d. The reason we chose this date was because he would be out of the house, so no men. \n\nI personally don\u2019t like being in swimsuits in public and I know that\u2019s my own separate issue to work on. I was excited about this in part because I feel really comfortable and safe around these ladies and could relax instead of worrying about how I look in a swimsuit. \n\nAnyway, since this development, I told her that I didn\u2019t think I would attend because I wasn\u2019t feeling great about being in a swimsuit. I didn\u2019t specifically say her husband\u2019s presence was the problem, but she\u2019s a smart girl. She told me to think about it and asked me to still bring the food.

She seemed peeved. \n\nNow, I heard from another friend in the group that she\u2019s mad at me for cancelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t right for me to offer to help with food and bail. And the worse part is she told her friend that I am making it out like her husband is a pervert. UHM what?

I guess, I feel like not wanting to either 1. make myself uncomfortable by being in a swimsuit in front of someone I\u2019d rather not or 2. Changing my plans again to assemble the thing and go sit clothed outside the hot tub (weird right?) feels worse to me than being known to be modest as a personality trait?

Unfortunately, that\u2019s not my situation. I don\u2019t own a one-piece swimsuit (I only ever go swimming at my own home for obvs reasons) or anything that covers more than a usual two-piece. That just feels like a lot for me (literally just me personally. This is no comment on anyone else\u2019s swim attire) to be showing in front of any man, married or otherwise. And even if I did own a one-piece, I\u2019d want to be more covered. I grew up in a household of all women and there are PLENTY of women I wouldn\u2019t let see me in a swimsuit. I guess this is just an issue I have to expect might come up from time to time. People may not like that I can\u2019t always participate and I might just have to be a big girl and eat that, ya know?

He was really excited about this and I (27M) suggested he have a house warming party. He landed on the idea inviting about a dozen of our mutual guy friends for a guys hot tub party/ spa night. I was really excited for him and ngl excited to attend. I offered to make and bring a large charcuterie board. I actually went and bought all the ingredients for this, which was about $200. \n\nSo earlier this week (the event is Monday on the 3-day weekend), he told me his brother cancelled the plans he made with his friends so he could stay for the party because it \u201csounded more fun\u201d. The reason we chose this date was because he would be out of the house, so no gay men. \n\nI personally don\u2019t like being in swimsuits in public and I know that\u2019s my own separate issue to work on. I was excited about this in part because I feel really comfortable and safe around these men and could relax instead of worrying about how I look in a swimsuit. \n\nAnyway, since this development, I told him that I didn\u2019t think I would attend because I wasn\u2019t feeling great about being in a swimsuit. I didn\u2019t specifically say his brothers presence was the problem, but he\u2019s a smart guy. He told me to think about it and asked me to still bring the food. I made new plans for the day and won\u2019t be in town to bring/make it. I let hIM know this as soon as it developed. He seemed peeved. \n\nNow, I heard from another friend in the group that he\u2019s mad at me for cancelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t right for me to offer to help with food and bail. And the worse part is he told his friend that I am making it out like his brother is a pervert. UHM what?
