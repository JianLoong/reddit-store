I was excited about this in part because I feel really comfortable and safe around these ladies and could relax instead of worrying about how I look in a swimsuit. \n\nAnyway, since this development, I told her that I didn\u2019t think I would attend because I wasn\u2019t feeling great about being in a swimsuit. I didn\u2019t specifically say her husband\u2019s presence was the problem, but she\u2019s a smart girl. She told me to think about it and asked me to still bring the food.

She seemed peeved. \n\nNow, I heard from another friend in the group that she\u2019s mad at me for cancelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t right for me to offer to help with food and bail. And the worse part is she told her friend that I am making it out like her husband is a pervert. UHM what?

I guess, I feel like not wanting to either 1. make myself uncomfortable by being in a swimsuit in front of someone I\u2019d rather not or 2. Changing my plans again to assemble the thing and go sit clothed outside the hot tub (weird right?) feels worse to me than being known to be modest as a personality trait?

Unfortunately, that\u2019s not my situation. I don\u2019t own a one-piece swimsuit (I only ever go swimming at my own home for obvs reasons) or anything that covers more than a usual two-piece. That just feels like a lot for me (literally just me personally. This is no comment on anyone else\u2019s swim attire) to be showing in front of any man, married or otherwise. And even if I did own a one-piece, I\u2019d want to be more covered. I grew up in a household of all women and there are PLENTY of women I wouldn\u2019t let see me in a swimsuit. I guess this is just an issue I have to expect might come up from time to time. People may not like that I can\u2019t always participate and I might just have to be a big girl and eat that, ya know?

He was really excited about this and I (27M) suggested he have a house warming party. He landed on the idea inviting about a dozen of our mutual guy friends for a guys hot tub party/ spa night. I was really excited for him and ngl excited to attend. I offered to make and bring a large charcuterie board. I actually went and bought all the ingredients for this, which was about $200. \n\nSo earlier this week (the event is Monday on the 3-day weekend), he told me his brother cancelled the plans he made with his friends so he could stay for the party because it \u201csounded more fun\u201d. The reason we chose this date was because he would be out of the house, so no gay men. \n\nI personally don\u2019t like being in swimsuits in public and I know that\u2019s my own separate issue to work on. I was excited about this in part because I feel really comfortable and safe around these men and could relax instead of worrying about how I look in a swimsuit. \n\nAnyway, since this development, I told him that I didn\u2019t think I would attend because I wasn\u2019t feeling great about being in a swimsuit. I didn\u2019t specifically say his brothers presence was the problem, but he\u2019s a smart guy. He told me to think about it and asked me to still bring the food. I made new plans for the day and won\u2019t be in town to bring/make it. I let hIM know this as soon as it developed. He seemed peeved. \n\nNow, I heard from another friend in the group that he\u2019s mad at me for cancelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t right for me to offer to help with food and bail. And the worse part is he told his friend that I am making it out like his brother is a pervert. UHM what?

They planned a girls night specifically for when the husband wouldn\u2019t be home, for JUST the girls.\nThe the husband invites himself along, but the event isn\u2019t opened up to the guests to bring their partners too?\n\nOP isn\u2019t making this guy out to be a creep; he\u2019s doing a fine job on his own!", "No, co-ed parties are ok\u2026when they are actually co-ed. Calling one dude surrounded by a dozen scantily clad women in a hot tub \u201cco-ed\u201d is like saying you have a \u201cdiverse\u201d team because your group of white people also has a single brown person in it. This guy just wants to feel like he has his own harem.", "OP said he never joins them for movies or board games so my bet is on \u201cpervert\u201d.", "No! Don't give the food! I think you should have a week of luxurious snack dinners. \n\nI get the swimsuit thing. I didn't swim for almost 20 years because I was so uncomfortable with my body. I finally broke the pattern on a trip with a bunch of older gay men and a few close girlfriends. Now you can't get me out of the sea during the summer. \n\nI wear a two piece - the bottoms are mid-thigh high waist bike short-style (Sea brand, but a google shows Good American is making the style too) and the top is a sports bra style.", ">Her husband decided he wants to be in a hot tub with all his wife\u2019s friends wearing swimsuits. \n\nWhat else would people be wearing in a hot tub? It's impossible to want to hang out with the opposite sex wearing swimsuits without being a pervert? Holy shit you all are being absurd", "And paid in advance", "Eh, I do think this is a bit different, since the party was OP\u2019s suggestion. \n\nHosting a party yourself vs hosting a party with the help of someone else organizing $200 of food is a very different prospect. Since OP was instrumental from the start of the idea, her friend may not have even wanted to host without OP\u2019s help. \n\nNow she\u2019s still on the hook for the party, but OP\u2019s pulled out from what she suggested and said she would contribute. \n\nI do understand the friend\u2019s frustration and request here.", "Naw as a guy canceling your own plans just to be around an all girl party where you they'll all be in bikini is weird af.\n\nHe didn't even give a good reason, just that it'd be more fun.", "Yeah exactly like wth?! This is the craziest advice I have ever seen and I have seen some doozies. She can\u2019t tell her she doesn\u2019t want her husband around.", "Technically, it is just *changes. In this particular case it ruins but generally no it\u2019s only just a change", "I\u2019m quite the people pleaser, and lemme tell you that my husband is NOT. So I think I\u2019d do it like you too: \u2018oh, husbands are invited? He can play games with yours, that\u2019ll be cool!\u2019 And then mission mine to outcreep the creeper.", "He enjoys charcuterie and having deep sensitive conversations with emotional mature people, you know, not boys playing video games and the their childish sexist banter\u2026 /s", "And to not even invite his friend/s he was gonna hang out with and just make it a group thing too. A full cancel just for being the only guy there", "\"Thought it was more fun\". Ha ha. Thought his teenage dreams come true.", "If his plans had just fallen through and he was gonna be home, that'd be one thing. But canceling BECAUSE they will be there is creepy af. That's the only reason it's weird.", "So you can't be friends with women ? Or can't imagine wanting to hang out? This thread is wild", "NTA maybe you should tell some of the other girls what happened and why you\u2019re not coming", "Find out and update please if the other friends who are supposed to go didn't 'get sick ' or have something ' come up' at the last minute. pretty please I am curious", "\"You could apologise that your changed plans gave an impact on her preparation\"\n\nOnly if she apogizes that her changed plans impacted OP.", "No, she agreed without the husband being a participant. OP couldn\u2019t spell it out to her plus more fun? Cmon this man clearly wants to be s as round woman in a hot tub and the only man. He should\u2019ve left them alone and told him not to cancel his plans.", "Its straight up perverted. If the sexes were reversed I still think it would be wrong then it would be the woman in a bikini with all the men say in Speedo\u2019s. The wife is in denial. The husband is straight up peeping on her woman friends. She should\u2019ve said no or if he wants to use it\u2019s my house card rule, cancel the party altogether.", "He\u2019s a foodie who has so many hot takes on discussing sausage. Totally understandable. The fellas just insist on playing with their meatballs and he\u2019s looking to make new friends who really get him /s", "\"So partners are allowed to take part now? Great, I will tell my friend/husband/male bf from work to be there, too!\"\n\nWould maybe have made this weird couple to rethink their plans...", "all women hanging out in a hot tub in their swim suits. It sounds like a penthouse letter.", "The cancelling is really what makes it stick. If he didn\u2019t have any plans and would just be home, it\u2019d still be a bit odd for him to participate, but at least more understandable since he might be bored. But he _cancelled plans_ to join them. It baffles me OP\u2019s friend thinks nothing of it.", "No, I\u2019m just introverted while my wife is extroverted. I do all the cooking for parties because I have a background in restaurants, but it burns me out and I have to be alone for awhile. I even do this at other peoples houses. We have an elderly friend who loves parties but can\u2019t physically do the work of hosting one. So we go to his place and host it for him. A typical party is at least 20 people and we have had 40. I do all the mains, which he pays for, while sides are often pot luck. But after the food is prepared and people are eating, I usually finish my plate and retreat to a spare bedroom for a nap.", ">It\u2019s odd that he wants to hang with a bunch of women in bathing suits.\n\nWhy is that odd? Maybe if he never has any interest in talking with the  any other time, but there's no indication of that. Maybe his other plans really were boring and just a \"if nothing else better comes along\". Everyone jumping to calling him a pervert are all sexist as fuck", "If the other women don't find a last minute excuse not to go . I'm also curious if they are there. I wouldn't go - last minute excuse would come right up", "Yeah totally fair \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "This. Husband is a creep. What guy invites himself to his SO's ladies spa day? NTA, OP. Stay away from this guy, the red flags are starting to show.", "Yeah, that's probably what he was thinking. Lol\n\nI've been in situations similar but the difference is everyone there was comfortable with me, we were friends, and I was invited. Very big differences.", "[removed]", "omg....proper orgy in the hot tub! Drinks, camera's, social media....ugh, OP is so right to give this a miss!", "Bot partially stealing u/ObjectiveCoelacanth comment. Report > Spam > Harmful bots!", "[removed]", "What the fuck is this take? There's no indication he's doing anything other than wanting to hang out. This whole thread is sexist as fuck and I'm honestly shocked at all the terrible takes", "In a world where campaigns admit that women put themselves in dangerous situations because they do not want to be perceived rude and where those campaigns tell women to listen to their gut and their feelings... YOU are telling a young woman to be there, be nice and be more undressed than she feels comfortable with. To not be rude. \n\nI am not saying this will be a dangerous situation. But what you are advocating might put someone in a dangerous situation in the future.", "Also a bot! Stealing from u/throw05282021. Report > Spam > Harmful bots", "Nah I was about to put \"maybe\" in this and was too lazy.\nLots of women/girls, including myself, have firsthand experience of this take from men. Me myself at three different occasions (with three different guys): At a bar, a restaurant and a beach. It is a thing.\nRegarding friend's husband, I cannot tell.", ">That just feels like a lot for me (literally just me personally. This is no comment on anyone else\u2019s swim attire) to be showing in front of any man, married or otherwise.\n\nWhat about a lesbian? Would you feel the same way then? Or a bi woman?", "She specifically said there are also many women she would not wish to be seen by while wearing a swimsuit.  The reason she was happy to attend the originally planned event is that all the invited guests were people with whom she felt particularly comfortable."]}
