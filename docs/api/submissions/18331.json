I was excited about this in part because I feel really comfortable and safe around these ladies and could relax instead of worrying about how I look in a swimsuit. \n\nAnyway, since this development, I told her that I didn\u2019t think I would attend because I wasn\u2019t feeling great about being in a swimsuit. I didn\u2019t specifically say her husband\u2019s presence was the problem, but she\u2019s a smart girl. She told me to think about it and asked me to still bring the food.

She seemed peeved. \n\nNow, I heard from another friend in the group that she\u2019s mad at me for cancelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t right for me to offer to help with food and bail. And the worse part is she told her friend that I am making it out like her husband is a pervert. UHM what?

I guess, I feel like not wanting to either 1. make myself uncomfortable by being in a swimsuit in front of someone I\u2019d rather not or 2.

Unfortunately, that\u2019s not my situation. I don\u2019t own a one-piece swimsuit (I only ever go swimming at my own home for obvs reasons) or anything that covers more than a usual two-piece. That just feels like a lot for me (literally just me personally. This is no comment on anyone else\u2019s swim attire) to be showing in front of any man, married or otherwise. And even if I did own a one-piece, I\u2019d want to be more covered. I grew up in a household of all women and there are PLENTY of women I wouldn\u2019t let see me in a swimsuit. I guess this is just an issue I have to expect might come up from time to time. People may not like that I can\u2019t always participate and I might just have to be a big girl and eat that, ya know?

I can understand making assumptions about the reason you aren't comfortable being in a swimsuit around her husband. Even so, you have the right to be uncomfortable and you handled your discomfort in an appropriate way.\n\nIf the food is a big issue and it's possible, you could have a friend who is attending pick up the stuff for the charcuterie board and do it instead.", "NTA.  Husband changed the vibe, you opted out.  And from your post, husband changed his plans because the girls only party \u201csounded more fun\u201d - sounds like he was looking forward to eyeballing all the gals in their swimsuits and pretending he was the stallion of the herd.  \n\nYour friend needs to figure out why he suddenly changed his mind before she starts putting words in people's mouths.", "Nta - but I would correct that thinking about her husband. Tell her you don\u2019t think her husband is a pervert, and you felt that when she changed the rules about it being coed, you felt uncomfortable. Under different circumstances this would be different and she has no right to invalidate your feelings.", "NAH. You spent $200 on food to bring, that sounds like a commitment to me and you really shouldn't have offered and paid if you didn't intend to actually bring it. But you also don't have to be anywhere you're uncomfortable. I can see why she thinks you think her husband is a creep based on your reaction though. Maybe get a swim suit with rash guard sleeves and board shorts so you don't feel like you're wearing a real swim suit if you're self conscious!", "And not because her husband dropped his plans with his buddies, to hang up with a bunch of women in bikinis in his backyard\u2026 i cant think of a man who would like to be in a girls night if he is really not checking them out instead pf his buddies", "Oh gosh I really super hope not. That would be horrid.", "I sorta hate that he seems like such a creep in the situation. IRL, he seems like a fine guy. I generally like him. BUT yeah, after reading through this, people are right in that I can\u2019t really find a good reason for him to cancel on his friends to crash her girls night? Like I would love to be like \u201cwell, obviously, it\u2019s because we are fun, intelligent, and funny\u201d but it\u2019s not like he goes to the movies with us??? Idk I didn\u2019t opt out because I thought he was being creepy, just because he\u2019s a man and I was comfortable with the specific group of ladies we invited. Tbh there are girls who would cause me to cancel if they were gonna be there. I\u2019m just very modest. I didn\u2019t say he was being pervy to her and I really didn\u2019t feel that way at the time, so it hurt my feelings when she said that. In hindsight though, maybe you\u2019re right that she felt like it was a little off and was trying to go around like \u201che\u2019s doing totally normal things and cheerypie is the one making it weird\u201d to make herself feel better about it?", "Thanks. \n\nKnitter and quilter ....", "My husband would never think yo invite himself to a girls night esp not a hot tub one that is so wrong! \n\nNow if everyone is bringing partners that's different but one guy with a bunch of girls, alcohol... Yeah not right can't see why the friend wants her hubby there or why the rest are ok with it.\n\nNTA maybe look for different people to hang out with. She's a bit off to me", "YUP\n\n>she told me her husband cancelled the plans he made with his friends so he could stay for the party because it \u201csounded more fun\u201d. The reason we chose this date was because he would be out of the house, so no men. \n\nWhat part of this is NOT pervy??\n\nThey *specifically* picked a date when he would NOT be there, because they *specifically* wanted and event withOUT men.\n\nHe *cancelled* his other plans.\n\nThe reason he cancelled his other plans is because an event with *all women in bathing suits* \"sounded more fun.\"\n\nLike... how much more obvious.could the guy get??", "Yeah, I've known some good guys who are comfortable as the only man in a group, but they don't intentionally cancel their own plans to hang out on a girls night.

That\u2019s why I brought it here actually. She\u2019s a great friend. This is such an exception and feels totally unlike the her I know to be talking about someone behind their back. I thought I could use a second opinion because it all just felt awful and I was worried I wasn\u2019t seeing it correctly", "Haha I love Community! The worse part is I wasn\u2019t even thinking he was being a lurker until this thread. I was too focused on my own discomfort, which would\u2019ve been a thing no matter who the dude was or why he was there. I literally had no intention of implying he was a creep. But if the trench coat fits \u2026", "Not even \"plans magically fell through\" -- he *specifically **cancelled** previous plans.*", "Could be she didn't tell him it was a hot tub thing. Could be she's been on him about not liking her friends. Could totally be he's a perv though, just don't want to rule out the other things.", "Thank you for responding. I don\u2019t know that I agree. I felt at the time by saying the issue was my own comfort in a swimsuit, which is the root of the issue, put the blame on me and avoided a situation in which it could feel like I was saying husband couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be at his own house, ya know? I also feel like saying it\u2019s men in general opens the door for her to be like \u201che\u2019s not like other men\u201d and then when I\u2019m still uncomfortable and still not attending, it feels even more like an insult? To me, this part feels entirely out of the blue to be offended by and I was only really worried about being the asshole in regard to the food.\n\nBUT that is just my perspective and we come to AITA to learn from others\u2019 opinions. Thank you for sharing yours. It does give me something to think about in the future and I appreciate your time.", "I don\u2019t remember exactly. I think I went shopping Monday, so she told me about husband Tuesday. And I got invited to new plans Thursday and let her know. Other friend reached out to me today. \n\nHm. I think she would know. We have talked about it before and I didn\u2019t go to a lake trip thing for the same reason, but she could\u2019ve forgotten. \n\nI am debating giving her the ingredients, but it doesn\u2019t feel great. also, the reason I offered to make it is I tend to do them for events on the side and people ask me to make them from time to time. I think she will be disappointed regardless because it won\u2019t turn out the way she envisioned. But I do genuinely want her to have a good time, so it might be worth it to give it to her. Idk. I don\u2019t want to be petty because my feelings are hurt", "Husband was 100% creep mode. How else can you take him canceling a boys night the second he finds out his wife is having a bunch of friends in swimsuits over?", "Yeah my immediate thought after reading the question was\n\nFree food, apparently.\n\nThe audacity of some people. Reminds me of the post of the bride and MoH being mad the SiL won't pay $600 for a bachelorette thing she said she's not going on right out of the gate.\n\nHow can people be like well I don't care you're not coming gimme?!", ">she feels I am making her husband out to be a creep.\n\nNo, you're not. *Her husband* is making *himself* out to be a creep.\n\n>she told me her husband cancelled the plans he made with his friends so he could stay for the party because it \u201csounded more fun\u201d.

Or is her husband the only one who gets to ogle women in the hot tub?", "No! You were polite and respectful, and now she\u2019s talking poorly about you to your friends. You owe her nothing.", ">I think I am most hurt about her telling others she feels I am making her husband out to be a creep.\n\nI mean, he is lol. He actively cancelled hanging out with a bunch of people he likes to hang out with, because its somehow \"more fun\" to hang out with his wifes friends, which I'm sure has nothing (/s) to do with them wearing very little in the same tub. The guy could be a clueless monk but there's no way this doesn't look creepy.", "As a guy, I would never be home if an event like this was happening.  I would literally just find somewhere else to be.  Being there at all is weird.  Actually saying he canceled plans to be there is alarm bells.    My wife would assuredly drop comments about me needing to make plans for that night if I didn't make it clear too.\n\nEdit:  honestly the only two scenarios I can come up with making sense is if many of your friend group are single and they are either trying to play matchmaker or they are swingers.  Even then it doesn't make sense because a game night etc would accomplish it without the creep factor.", ">I sorta hate that he seems like such a creep in the situation\n\nHe seems like a creep in this situation because HE IS A CREEP IN THIS SITUATION.\n\nEven if his other plans had fallen through or been cancelled by someone else, the only NOT-creep option would have been for him to find something else to do that night/day, or, if he was going to be home, to promise to stay in his room or somewhere *away from* the women in the hot tub.\n\n>but it\u2019s not like he goes to the movies with us???\n\nExactly. The \"sounds fun\" part is not the women who will be there, it's the bathing suits they'll be wearing.\n\n>to make herself feel better about it?\n\nYUP.

Wouldn't it occur to him that the ladies might be uncomfortable with a man around?", "And this is part of why you have so many women as friends. You respect boundaries.", "It\u2019s for sure not you.  My only thought is that she is making it an issue of her husband and feeling offended that this is somehow your comment on him and their relationship so she\u2019s more looking for validation against that when she\u2019s talking to others\n\nWhich is unfortunate that she\u2019s completely missing the point and not handling it well at all.  And just really wants that charcuterie board which\u2026 who can blame her?!

Other men are not this blatantly obvious about their creepiness.\n\nShe would have found a way to be mad at you no matter what you had said/how you had worded it.\n\nShea probably mad at him herself, but can't be (openly) mad at him, so she's deflecting and making you the bad guy.", "if you want to show good faith, my suggestion is to give the ingredients to a friend. Sure, it may not turn out the same, but it's an olive branch and an opening for y'all to have a proper discussion so you can fully explain your feelings.
