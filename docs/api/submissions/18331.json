A friend of mine (23F) has recently bought a house that came with a large, nice hot tub. She was really excited about this and I (27F) suggested she have a house warming party. She landed on the idea inviting about a dozen of our mutual girl friends for a ladies hot tub party/ spa night. I was really excited for her and ngl excited to attend. I offered to make and bring a large charcuterie board. I actually went and bought all the ingredients for this, which was about $200. \n\nSo earlier this week (the event is Monday on the 3-day weekend), she told me her husband cancelled the plans he made with his friends so he could stay for the party because it \u201csounded more fun\u201d. The reason we chose this date was because he would be out of the house, so no men. \n\nI personally don\u2019t like being in swimsuits in public and I know that\u2019s my own separate issue to work on. I was excited about this in part because I feel really comfortable and safe around these ladies and could relax instead of worrying about how I look in a swimsuit. \n\nAnyway, since this development, I told her that I didn\u2019t think I would attend because I wasn\u2019t feeling great about being in a swimsuit. I didn\u2019t specifically say her husband\u2019s presence was the problem, but she\u2019s a smart girl. She told me to think about it and asked me to still bring the food. I made new plans for the day and won\u2019t be in town to bring/make it. I let her know this as soon as it developed. She seemed peeved. \n\nNow, I heard from another friend in the group that she\u2019s mad at me for cancelling and saying that it wasn\u2019t right for me to offer to help with food and bail. And the worse part is she told her friend that I am making it out like her husband is a pervert. UHM what? I never implied that, don\u2019t think it, and feel like he has a right to be in a house he owns? I just don\u2019t want to hot tub/ spa night with him.

Although it's very sexist, not wanting to be around men while in a swimsuit is somewhat common. And regardless it is completely your choice who you're comfortable around. So you're NAH for not going.

I am a pretty modest person. In general, I dress to cover.

It\u2019s kind of a hard spot. I do feel badly about not being able to assemble the board for her, and if I were going to be in town, I\u2019d probably just do it and drop it off or send it with another guest, but I won\u2019t be here. I think I am most hurt about her telling others she feels I am making her husband out to be a creep. That wasn\u2019t my intention.

It sounds like a penthouse letter.", "Most of my friends are women, so I've been to a few accidental im the only guy events and have felt fine.

The one who mentioned Hostess\u2019 comments to me feels it\u2019s a bit of a drain on the vibe for him to be there. I don\u2019t know what the others think. I know a couple of the girls have known husband for longer, but the majority of the attendees are friends of hostess (we all met in grad school)? I think husband is nice overall. I would be a touch disappointed he was coming to girls night if we were just playing board games or whatever. It\u2019s really the swimsuit thing that has me opting out.", "Hi thank you for responding. I was worried I might be the asshole for that reason. Although, to be fair, I suggested a housewarming party. She is the one who decided it should be a girls hot tub party. If it were a normal clothes event, I would still be coming. No, they didn\u2019t invite any more guys to my knowledge. To be fair, I don\u2019t think the husband is a perv. I generally like him, but do think it is out of left field he\u2019d want to attend a party of his wife\u2019s friends? \n\nDo you think I should offer to give her the supplies for the board? The reason I offered to make it was because I tend to arrange them for events and sometimes people ask me to? I won\u2019t be able to do that part since I will be out of town.", "The husband does sound like a pervert tho", "Hi. Thanks for responding. I did suggest a housewarming party. She is the one who decided it should be a girls hot tub thing. Her husband deciding to stay last minute did change things for me. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a pervert, I generally like him, although I am HER friend and don\u2019t know him super well.

Do you think I should offer to give her the supplies for it?", "> Regardless, do you feel like maybe I should offer her the supplies to make the board herself?\n\nAbsolutely not. Do not do this. She changed the party and invited her husband without conferring with any of you. You gave her plenty of notice that you would not be in attendance. You\u2019re not her caterer; you have no obligation to bring food to an event you\u2019re not attending.\n\n\nThe worst part is that she\u2019s badmouthing you to your circle because of HER actions. What a sorry excuse for a friend.", "She's lying.   That's not cool.   Do not offer her the supplies - especially since she is trash talking  about you!", "> do you feel like maybe I should offer her the supplies to make the board herself?\n\nAt cost perhaps, but otherwise why in gods' names would you?  Never reward bad behavior, which this is.", "I was keeping that as an inside thought. The husbands\u2019s definitely up for some eye candy", "Or at least creepy.  Just thinking of him being there makes my skin crawl.", "You use the word pervert very freely. There are lots of men who like to be around women. They may be a little misunderstood but pervert is not applicable.", "I am uncomfortable in a swimsuit as well. Probably would have handled it the same. You do you.", "I wonder how many of his buddies will just show up.  Keep us updated.", "Hi! Thanks for clarifying what you proposed, i misunderstood.\n\nI do think giving her the supplies is a good compromise. Would you use them otherwise?\n\n\nAlso, you are a good friend willing to spend all that money plus time to make the board for your friends party.", "I didn\u2019t read it that way \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don\u2019t know them personally so I can\u2019t make that judgment", "At the very least yes you should give her all the ingredients that you bought so they could have the food. And I\u2019m not saying you are a pervert, but that is what it looks like from the outside because you all of a sudden back out because there\u2019s gonna be a dude there", "Yeah i get that.

Ugh that would be a nightmare. I hope for everyone\u2019s sake, they have the sense to keep away.", "Thank you. I am genuinely excited for her because I know she worked hard to save up to for the purchase. I would definitely use them, but they might be put to better use at her event. I know she will still be disappointed because it won\u2019t turn out how she envisioned, but I will likely just go ahead and offer them to her. I hate that it turned out this way and I wish my feelings weren\u2019t hurt about the comment about making her husband out to be a creep. That wasn\u2019t my intention at all. I am just a modest type of gal.", "How did you read it? He suddenly thinks spending an evening in a hot tub with a bunch of women is more fun than hanging out with his friends. It\u2019s odd that he wants to hang with a bunch of women in bathing suits.", "He had plans for boys night but changed when he heard there was a ladies hot tub night with all the other women.    He can go in the hot tub any night.   Why does he need to go when all the women are attending?", "I might offer her the ingredients, but it does feel kinda bad on my end to be paying for all that for a thing I\u2019d have liked to go to, but don\u2019t feel I can really participate in any longer. I guess, I feel like not wanting to either 1. make myself uncomfortable by being in a swimsuit in front of someone I\u2019d rather not or 2. Changing my plans again to assemble the thing and go sit clothed outside the hot tub (weird right?) feels worse to me than being known to be modest as a personality trait? May I ask why backing out because it\u2019s now co-ed, feels negative to you? (aside from the food issue, which I can fully understand)", "see ive got no poker face id be making \ud83e\udd74 face what do you mean your husband is attending ladies night specifically planned for when he wasnt home?", "Still not a pervert. He is doing what lots of men do, and others wish they had the courage to do.", "You would give $200 of food to someone who is tarnishing your reputation and lying saying that you called her husband a pervert?    Oh please don't,  don't let people treat you like that.   Her reaction to your decision is NOT OK.", "I just see it as rude.", "I met my absolute best friend through her husband. We even take trips together (including places where we wear bathing suits). If she were planning this evening in their hot tub and she said i know i said girls night but I invited \u201cBrad,\u201d my response would be \u201cwhy?\u201d Then \u201cwhy would he even want to come?\u201d", "Ok.", "I really appreciate your inclination to be in support of me. This whole situation feels pretty crappy tbh. She definitely hurt my feelings by choosing to interpret my decision as an attack and by talking about it with someone else instead of me. I feel like I could\u2019ve explained if I was given the opportunity. But at the same time, with this situation as an exception, she\u2019s always been a good friend. I do genuinely want her to have a good time. I just don\u2019t want to participate at this point. It feels like a tough call to me rn. Thank you for your input. It is nice to hear that no matter what, I\u2019m not actively the villain. The situation feels just plain bad.", "Hmmm that\u2019s an interesting take. I don\u2019t know that I understand. What, in your opinion, should I have done in my situation?", "In my opinion, i think you should have faced being uncomfortable for just a little bit because once the party got started, shit would\u2019ve worked out and you would\u2019ve had fun. If you were completely going to be all naked, I could definitely see why you would want to back out and that would be perfectly fine but if you\u2019re wearing a swimsuit you\u2019re still clothed so I don\u2019t see how you should feel uncomfortable. And it is the husband of one of your friends, so I also don\u2019t understand why you would feel uncomfortable in front of him. I\u2019m not trying to sound like an asshole there btw text doesn\u2019t understand tone \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, I guess I can see a world in which someone with minor body issues might be able to relax/have fun eventually. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not my situation. I don\u2019t own a one-piece swimsuit (I only ever go swimming at my own home for obvs reasons) or anything that covers more than a usual two-piece. That just feels like a lot for me (literally just me personally. This is no comment on anyone else\u2019s swim attire) to be showing in front of any man, married or otherwise. And even if I did own a one-piece, I\u2019d want to be more covered. I grew up in a household of all women and there are PLENTY of women I wouldn\u2019t let see me in a swimsuit. I guess this is just an issue I have to expect might come up from time to time. People may not like that I can\u2019t always participate and I might just have to be a big girl and eat that, ya know? It\u2019s unfortunate that my friend feels bad, but I think I have to do what I have to do for my own comfort. Thanks for sharing your perspective. I appreciate the time.", "More than welcome :) and i can understand body issues. I\u2019m a big girl and I normally swim in a tank and shorts but I just learned to just say fuck you to others and go about having fun but everyone has their own battles. :)"]}
