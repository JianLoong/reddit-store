{"id": 4733, "submission_id": "zlzxlo", "title": "AITA for refusing to spend yet another NYE with my bf's best friend's gf?", "selftext": "Apologies for the confusing title. I (28F) have been with my partner (33M) for 6 years. Throughout our relationship we've had a tradition of spending NYE with my partner's best friend (33M) and his wife (31F). We'll call her Maddison. From the very start of our relationship, I've struggled with spending time with Maddison. I find that I can be polite, chat and find something to laugh about with most people. Maddison is very hard work. She talks constantly about herself, will never ask questions about anything else (unless it leads to her being able to talk some more about herself). Me, my bf and her husband have a similar sense of humour whereas her humour is basically just her being mean. Because I share this with her husband, I know she has never liked me. She dishes out underhand insults as compliments, is rude and obnoxious, and makes comments in relation to something general, which is actually again just another insult that you cant pull her up on because she doesnt say anything directly. She's passive aggressive to say the least. Because she is an important part of my bf's life, I've learned to just tolerate this over the years and try not to let her get to me. However, a couple of years ago, we were at their house for NYE and she outright called me a bitch and insulted my appearance. She was very drunk but I could tell she had been desperate to finally say something rude to me. She also had a random outburst at my husband and launched into a tirade of abuse at him which again, was very personal and insulting. He is able to tolerate her more than me though as last year (Covid gave us a year's break), we spent NYE with them again. At the time, I said to my bf that this was the last year I was willing to spend NYE with them and that I had had enough. (Initally I'd said I wouldn't but compromised by us going to their place and leaving after midnight).\n\nThis year, I reminded my bf that I would not be spending NYE with them. I'm 5 months pregnant amd I'm not willing to put myself through spending another NYE treading on eggshells, waiting for someone to insult me (directly or underhand), or be around negative energy when I've done it for the past 6/7 years. I explained how uncomfortable she makes me, and that I still have to tolerate her on other occasions we spend with them to keep the peace, but NYE is a hard no. I also just wanted to spend this time with him as our last NYE as a two before baby arrives.\n\nI suggested we see them a different night but he says it's not the same and that it's important for him to spend one last NYE with his best friend for the tradition. He asked me to compromise but I explained I already have compromised all the other years I've NYE with them being uncomfortable. I said it's up to him who he chooses to spend his NYE with but that I won't be spending mine with them. So, AITA for being unwilling to compromise after years of compromising?", "created_utc": 1671046238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlzxlo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_yet_another_nye_with/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very strange that a bf who loves and respects you would not only want you to experience that abuse over and over but that he actively tries to make you or convince you or whatever.

He needs to get his priorities in order before this baby arrives because they're not at home where they should be. You and that baby should be #1 now, always.", "NTA. You are setting a reasonable boundary given the history you have with this person.\n\nIs there a compromise that would insulate you from this person's abuse? Could you spend NYE with a larger group of friends so that it isn't 1-on-1?", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is the a-hole for making you put up with this person while he enjoys time with his friend.", "NTA. This is a reasonable and very healthy boundary and, quite frankly, the fact that you put up with this woman at all after the way she's treated you seems to be compromise enough, in my opinion. He should have YOUR back on this one, not expect you to spend your last NYE without children with someone who behaves abusively towards you just because it's tradition.", "NTA\n\nYou've done your time.

Hard.

Why he\u2019d want to keep subjecting you to that rude woman is mind boggling.", "NTA. And I would insist him starting on a new tradition, with you, in your home. And I would make it my hill do die on. Because what happens when the baby is unwell, but he wants to watch X athletic thing with him \u201cfor the tradition\u201d, so he leaves you to deal with it?

Its 1 thing to allow himself to be insulted its another for him to continue to allow her to insult you. Also his friend is shitty since he doesn't put his foot down and put a stop to this. It's also weird he thinks spending 1 last year with his friend is more important then spending it with his pregnant girlfriend as both of your lives change in a really major way in the new year.

There are MANY reasons women are jealous of other women, only one may be that they want or are having their bf.

Your bf is more interested in hanging out with his buddy than being concerned that you are dealing  a passive aggressive, toxic person for the night.  You are 5 months pregnant and it's not like you are going to be out partying to the wee hours of the night at this point.  I would just want to spend the night at home and not out at some fancy party this year.", "NTA. But can you compromise with your boyfriend.

Why does your bf not only welcome it, but encourage you to just take it?", "That\u2019s quite a leap there\u2026"]}
