{"id": 4733, "submission_id": "zlzxlo", "title": "AITA for refusing to spend yet another NYE with my bf's best friend's gf?", "selftext": "Apologies for the confusing title. I (28F) have been with my partner (33M) for 6 years. Throughout our relationship we've had a tradition of spending NYE with my partner's best friend (33M) and his wife (31F). We'll call her Maddison. From the very start of our relationship, I've struggled with spending time with Maddison. I find that I can be polite, chat and find something to laugh about with most people. Maddison is very hard work. She talks constantly about herself, will never ask questions about anything else (unless it leads to her being able to talk some more about herself). Me, my bf and her husband have a similar sense of humour whereas her humour is basically just her being mean. Because I share this with her husband, I know she has never liked me. She dishes out underhand insults as compliments, is rude and obnoxious, and makes comments in relation to something general, which is actually again just another insult that you cant pull her up on because she doesnt say anything directly. She's passive aggressive to say the least. Because she is an important part of my bf's life, I've learned to just tolerate this over the years and try not to let her get to me. However, a couple of years ago, we were at their house for NYE and she outright called me a bitch and insulted my appearance. She was very drunk but I could tell she had been desperate to finally say something rude to me. She also had a random outburst at my husband and launched into a tirade of abuse at him which again, was very personal and insulting. He is able to tolerate her more than me though as last year (Covid gave us a year's break), we spent NYE with them again. At the time, I said to my bf that this was the last year I was willing to spend NYE with them and that I had had enough. (Initally I'd said I wouldn't but compromised by us going to their place and leaving after midnight).\n\nThis year, I reminded my bf that I would not be spending NYE with them. I'm 5 months pregnant amd I'm not willing to put myself through spending another NYE treading on eggshells, waiting for someone to insult me (directly or underhand), or be around negative energy when I've done it for the past 6/7 years. I explained how uncomfortable she makes me, and that I still have to tolerate her on other occasions we spend with them to keep the peace, but NYE is a hard no. I also just wanted to spend this time with him as our last NYE as a two before baby arrives.\n\nI suggested we see them a different night but he says it's not the same and that it's important for him to spend one last NYE with his best friend for the tradition. He asked me to compromise but I explained I already have compromised all the other years I've NYE with them being uncomfortable. I said it's up to him who he chooses to spend his NYE with but that I won't be spending mine with them. So, AITA for being unwilling to compromise after years of compromising?", "created_utc": 1671046238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlzxlo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_yet_another_nye_with/", "score": 498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The misogyny at play by labeling this \"girl fights\" is epic. I am well aware I have said some things about/to her that I shouldn't have but after years of listening to this stuff (I was judging in my head the whole time, I am not coming out of this clean), it's so offensive to me that several of the most important men in my life think my interactions with this woman are on the same level of jerky-ness.\n\nGot distracted, point being...
