Your friend is ridiculous, insensitive and incredibly selfish.  You dodged a bullet.\n\nI hope all goes well with your daughters surgery.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShe has the right to set the terms for her own wedding celebration.\n\nShe can, quite reasonably, insist on a child free wedding ceremony and reception, as long as she accepts that some guests who are parents will decline because they cannot leave their children, or cannot get a sitter, or whatever the reason is.\n\nShe can even insist on a child free entire weekend, as long as she accepts that even more guests who are parents will decline for that same reason.\n\n**What she cannot do is make you feel guilty about declining.** You are neither mean, nor a bad friend. And you're a good mother.\n\nIf \"attend my wedding weekend or else\" is a condition of her friendship, you're better off without a so-called friend like that.", "NTA! I understand making an event child free, but trying to make it \u201cthinking about your sick children\u201d free takes a very high level of narcissism.\n\nWhat did she think? You\u2019d think about your kid less if she was FURTHER AWAY? Glad she\u2019s not in your life anymore OP.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad to say, but your friend seems to be very selfish and controlling. The idea that your daughter can\u2019t even be in the same town as her wedding is ridiculous and just mean. The fact that she brought up your daughter being adopted is very gross as well. You deserve an apology from her. I\u2019m not sure there is much to save of a friendship when she is that controlling and selfish? It is very sad, but you care deeply for your child and put her first which is great of you.", "NTA.  Okay, sure, a wedding is a big special day that you hopefully do once in a lifetime.  Having no kids for the wedding is a fairly well established practice, plenty of couples do that, but you have to acknowledge that some folks won\u2019t come if you do.  Expecting people to not even have their kid in the same city is some entitlement!  Especially a child whose health is fragile.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before we even get into her not really regarding your daughter as your child and your highest responsibility.  It doesn\u2019t really matter how you become a parent, being a parent has to become a central feature of your life, to have a healthy relationship with your child.  You really don\u2019t do anything without considering your kid until they\u2019re old enough to mind themselves responsibly.", "NTA\n\nI get that people put a lot of importance on their wedding, which is essentially a huge party.  Nothing is more important than your daughter and making sure that she stays healthy.  This person showed you who she really is.  If she wants to cut you out it\u2019s her loss.", "NTA. She expected you to choose her over your post surgery child.  She implied that adoption meant your daughter wasn't a \"real\" daughter.  You don't need this person in your life.", "Good for you mom.

A guest must give 100% of their attention to the bride during the entire wedding trip?!\n\nA childfree wedding means that the wedding is childfree. It doesn't mean that you can't travel with your children to the wedding city. In fact, a lot of considerate couples will arrange for a babysitter to watch guests' children during the wedding.\n\nI swear weddings turn people into the biggest assholes.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You bringing your child to the same city is reasonable. Your friends request is not. Is she usually like this? Also I\u2019d argue your attention is more than likely to be split if your daughter is 6 hours away. Stand your ground because this request is ridiculous.", "NTA. When the bride says child-free, she can restrict people from getting kids to the venue. IT DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE WHOLE CITY! \n\nPeople have the right to have child free weddings and guests have the right to decline the invite. Instead of respecting your choice and letting you come as a guest, she decides to double down and comment on your childs adoption. \n\nStand your ground OP. Your childs health and well-being is way more important than a wedding party!", "NTA. She\u2019s acting very entitled and egotistic. A good parent priorities their sick children above everything else, and a good friend understands that while their wedding is the most important thing in their life, it is not the most important thing for anyone else and does not exceed a sick child who needs their parent. \n\nHopefully your friend will realise this when her wedding is over and she\u2019s back in reality, but if not I\u2019d consider the friendship over and done.", "NTA and go no contact for forever", "NTA. Let's face it. If you left her at home, you would likely be calling home every 30 minutes to check in. How is that not \"divided\"?  She would still throw a fit.", "NTA, the bride is acting selfish and unreasonable.", "So tired of people weaponizing weddings. It's just a party! NTA A friend would understand, and would be protective of your daughter, and your feelings. An entitled, controlling, immature, narcissistic person cares only how things affect them.", "NTA. You suggested a reasonable compromise\u2026 your child won\u2019t be at the wedding or the reception, and your mother will watch her so you can still be close by in case something happens. \n\nShe is wanting you to leave your child (who would be recovering from surgery) at home with your mom, and expecting you to cater to her every whim on her wedding weekend as though you don\u2019t have a child with health issues.\n\nYour friend needs to understand that while you see her as a sister, your child is now your number one priority. She will in fact be the \u201cbad friend\u201d if she continues to use guilt trips to manipulate you into doing what she wants, as well as siccing her flying monkeys on you to also guilt trip you.", "NTA. That's some heinous shit she said. To prioritize a wedding over a child recovering from major surgery, yeah, not much to be lost there. I get that wedding are 'the big day' but there are limits to what you can ask of people, just like there are limits of what you can say to someone before they give up any pretense of friendship.", "NTA you don't bring your children to her wedding.", "NTA. The title had me in the first half.", "NTA. Your choices are 1) be a good mom or 2) be a good friend to a shitty human being. I know what one I would choose. I mean if you were my friend, I\u2019d tell you to just stay home and care for your child and not even worry about the wedding since that\u2019s what\u2019s really important and that we could catch up later. I would of course still want you to come, but that little one is far too precious.", "NTA.\n\nFrankly, I am so over bridezillas. Your friend is being ridiculous.  Of course you have to be near your daughter. Even with your mom taking care of her, if there are issues, you need to be able to get there quickly.\n\nI would reach out to my friend one more time. She may have been having an emotional moment and feels uncomfortable now.", "nta - i would never speak to her ever again especially after what she said about your daughter that was crossing a line that is very hard to come back from.", "NTA, you can have a child free wedding, you can't get angry if people RSVP no or cancel.  I love it when I see child free wedding invitations, it gives my an excuse to skip them and not send a gift.  Also a destination wedding, or people that ask for cash.  No, no and no.", "NTA\n\nIts good you aren't going. Bringing your daughter would be selfish of you. Not bc of your friend, but bc you rather would put your daughter through a long, exhausting travel to be near her instead of doing whats best for her and her recovery. I understand as a mom you want to be near your healing child, but you should still put the childs needs above yours - in this case the right thing to do would have been dropping out of the wedding as soon you got the date of the surgery, when being away from her for a day wasn't an option for you. \n\nTbh, 4 weeks after surgery, it would be fine if you are gone for 1 day as long the healing was going fine. But i don't judge you for this, thats smthg you as her mother knows best. Your child is more important than your friend, cancelling the wedding is a no brainer in this situation.", "NTA a friend that thinks their wedding is more important than your child's health is not a friend worth keeping.", "\"since then I\u2019ve had the other bridges maids...\"\n\nMy aunt was a bridges maid, she cleaned up the Golden Gate.", "Info- Is there a father in the picture?

It's her child free wedding   It's her time to shine.  It's her new beginnings.  It's her time to create lovely memories for the families and friends.   It's her forever.\n\n I can actually see the friend wanting a child free weekend.  I think it would have been an absolute blast.   \n\nThe friend has obligations as a mother.   She wants her child close.  And that's that.   \n\nShe's giving you grief because she wants you all to herself.     You drop out of the wedding party. And agree to come as a guest.  Friend she doesn't want you to be in attendance and has ended the friendship.   \n\nI don't think the friendship is over.   There's a snag in their relationship.

So much NTA!\n\nAnd she's a bit of a fool to think an parent there will go an entire week without thinking of their child(ren) and 100% focused on her.

That way, your mother can watch your child when there are wedding activities, but she also can get a break every day for herself.  \n\nYour mother could explore the city on her own, perhaps going to a museum, zoo, shopping, etc.  She can also do 1:1 activities with your daughter in an interesting place.  The three of you can spend some time together, etc. \n\nI'm sure there are others in the wedding party who have children, and who will be thinking of their kids during the week.  \n\nLikewise, some will have a spouse or long-term partner, and want to be in touch with them - they'll certainly going to at least think of their beloved!\n\nThe bride saying she wants to \" let loose and just have fun\" suggests she's imagining the sort of life one stereotypically lives in college, with parties, going to bars, maybe seeing strippers for the bachelorette party, flirting with men at a bar, etc.  \n\nBut you, at least, aren't a college kid anymore, and I'm sure others in the wedding party feel the same.  Those who have kids will be thinking of their kids, missing them, might not want to be drinking so much they couldn't travel back or deal with a crisis via phone calls to the babysitter/doctor etc.  Those with partners might be uncomfortable with things like seeing a stripper, might prefer to go back to their hotel room at night during the week to be sleeping with their loved one, to have their loved one at the wedding, to dance with and share the party with, etc.  \n\nThe idea that anyone is going to be \"out of sight, out of mind\" about their spouse/partner or children, and maybe others, such as an aging parent they care for, for the duration of an entire week, is not realistic.\n\nAnd the bride is going to be very disappointed when she realizes that even the most dedicated member of the wedding party is going to have concerns beyond being 100% focused on her for an entire week.", "2 things.\n\n1. You'd be giving more attention to your phone if your daughter was 6 hours away so you could leave immediately if needed for any reason, and you wouldn't be able to check in as easily as if she was in the same city so of course your attention would be ob your daughter and not the wedding.\n\n2. Your friend sounds horribly self centered. Has she always been like this or is it just the wedding bringing out the worst in her?", "This friendship may have run its course. She sounds jealous of your daughter tbh. Especially that crack about her being without you for so long bc she\u2019s adopted. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d get pass that. She fully expects you to give because that\u2019s always been what\u2019s happened.", "Even if your kid back home isn\u2019t sick, most parents are going to be thinking about them and checking in.

She is not worth your friendship.\n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA. She was way out of line", "NTA. I believe it worked out for the best.

I thought the opposite based on the title, but your ex-friend sounds honestly kind of heartless. I understand wanting a childfree wedding, but she doesn't get to demand a childfree radius around her wedding.

Not where I expected this story to go based on the title. But holy fuck, how callous is your friend. What an absolute dick.

At first from the post, I was close to saying yta, but the fact that your child is sick changes things.\n\nYour friend is justified to get mad given that it\u2019s her wedding that she has planned for a long time, and undoubtedly she may be stressed out of her mind. \n\nYou are also justified in being upset since it is your child, under your responsibility, and if anything happens to her or she\u2019s in pain, she\u2019ll be looking for you - and the thought of that is painful to bear.\n\nI would say, get her a nice wedding gift, write her a sincere letter apologizing for not being able to keep your promise to be at her wedding and hoping that she\u2019ll forgive you - and you\u2019ll always be waiting to rekindle the friendship and wish only the best for her marriage.

You can live in a van down by the river and it's ok to have a baby.\n\nBut if you want to adopt, literally every square inch of your home is inspected. You have background checks done on everyone in the house. ANY family member that will come into contact with the adopted kid is checked. Financial reviews for everyone!
