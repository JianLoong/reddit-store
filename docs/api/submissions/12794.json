I wasn't perfect, but I was functioning. \nI hated putting clothes on hangers or folding them so I shoved them into dresser drawers.\nSometimes I just left them in the bag.\nI hated laundry baskets so whenever clothes were dirty I'd just put them straight into the washing machine, wait until it was full, then wash em.\nI hated doing dishes so I would clean everything right after. If I used a lot all at once I would wash one every time I came to the kitchen until they were done.\nI was a terrible cook and a binge eater, but I managed. \nI Deep cleaned ~once every few months.\nI spent a lot of time on ig.\n\nIn comes my husband. \nHe's very neat & organized & a wonderful cook. \nA huge issue that's always been a part of our relationship is his need to clean.\nI was not raised to be super anal about it, but I love him & I've committed to doing the dishes every single day, vacuuming, dusting, & taking out trash every single weekend.\nMy husband deep cleans our shower, toilet, sinks, floors, counters, the trim, windows, AND balcony every week. He washes & hangs up all of our clothes.\n\nI'm bad w/ money so he's been in charge of paying off debt & financing everything. \nI'm bad about my diet so He's been meal planning/prepping for me.\nHe's been trying to get me to use pedal assist 1 or 2 on my bike every day when I come home from work.\nHe got me to delete ig from my phone. \nI was getting stressed at work so I requested part time, so he suggested I only get vto twice a month (vto is voluntary time off that gets released daily at my job)\nI became POA for my nana and he says \"we both know\" that he's gonna be the one doing most if the work for her since I'm so bad with money. (She just wants me to be poa so I can help her w/ her will and signing docs since she's blind, I'm not actually doing anything with her money)\n\nI'm grateful for him.\nBut he says he can't live his life like this. \nHe says he hates having to tell me to get off instagram all the time after I told him I'd delete it, of reminding me to take my medicine all the time. We actually DO both know I'd constantly forget if he didn't. I even have timers on my phone & I still forget. \n\nHe's sick of reminding me to use the pedal assist. I don't care about being more active than I already am, & he loves my body so that isn't it. As far as being healthy, his meal planning/prep has helped & he says he doesn't mind doing that for me. its all the little reminders he has to do. \nBut my point here is he diesnt HAVE to.\n\nHe doesn't HAVE to deep clean everything. He could just let me be on insta. He could just let me zoom home full throttle. He could just let some Chores go undone for a while. He doesn't have to help my nana.\n\nI feel ashamed I don't do more. HE does so I feel like I should to. I feel like a burden. But i cant say \"hey! You work so hard it makes me feel bad\" because that's stupid.", "created_utc": 1679348818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wx46e/aita_for_not_pulling_my_weight_around_the/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound like my ex. I spent 4 years picking up after him, trying to get him to help me clean around the house. He would constantly have amazon packages arriving and would open the boxes and throw the box and packaging into the living room, I'm not swimming in boxes cause I took them to the recycle. I tried to force him into helping me by making each of us have responsibilities ( I cook he does the dishes etc) and he always failed to do his side of things.

The executive dysfunction in my life is terrible. When my depression is at its worst I can take 6 hour long depression baths, and my executive dysfunction is so bad I won't even run the water to reheat it. Based on the replies I gather I am the asshole here. I hated taking Adderall because it made me feel sleepy all the time, but I'm gonna try discussing more options with my doctor. We are different, but we love each other, and that's why we're together. He told me this because it's something I need to work on to stay together, and that's okay.

You seem to accept that you can\u2019t handle your own finances. You took on your grandma as your responsibility knowing that he will be the one dealing with it because you don\u2019t even deal with your own. \n\nAnd your standards of cleaning are gross. Trash should be taken out AT LEAST every weekend and realistically more may be necessary. Dishes should be done daily, not just one when you walk into the kitchen. Deep cleaning like shower, toilet, sinks, floors, counters should all be done weekly. Not every few months. Honestly your cleaning standards are what make you the asshole\n\nEnjoy living in your filth and poor financial decisions when he leaves you because that what he means when he says he can\u2019t live like this anymore", "No, he doesn't have to help you with anything  He could just leave instead.

You can clearly see everything that's wrong and are not doing anything about it", "Ok, I think you need to hear this in the most kind way possible, hon: Yes, YTA\n\nOp, he clearly loves you because he has been carrying the mental load for awhile: bills to pay, when to pay, make dinner, buy groceries, etc.\n\nAnd then he\u2019s doing ALL the work. Like this is what most women complain about! They are going to work, taking care of the kids, and then going to work full or part time. All the while their lazy husbands do nothing. And talk about weaponized incompetence- I don\u2019t like to do it, so I don\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re right. He doesn\u2019t have to do it, but clearly if he doesn\u2019t, who is? How long before you have ants in the sink? And whose going to deal with it? Not you! Clearly! \n\nI get you may have some issues to work though. As someone with anxiety. I too do the social media death scrolling. But I still cook. Do dishes. Laundry. Take care of my own bills. Despite having a significant other who shares the work! But the key there is share! We both do things! If he cooks, I do the dishes. If he packs up the groceries, you bet ya, I\u2019m paying. I do the laundry, he takes out the trash. We share in the household duties!\n\nJust because you may have some issues- and I would seek counseling either way (because you need some empathy for your partner or he\u2019s out)- but these can be signs of depression or serious mental health issues. Keep in mind, mental illness can sometimes explain you behaviors, hon. But they aren\u2019t an excuse.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s time to step up and be a partner. Or accept you\u2019re going to be single!", "This sounds exhausting. Not only does he work and clean  but he has to take care of your mental load. When can he calm down and relax?", "I mean it sounds like your husband married a kid.  So yeah, technically YTA for not being a functioning adult in any way. I can understand why he isn't happy. \n\nBut the bigger questions are why are you like this? (Does your medication have an effect?) And do you actually want to change?  Because if you are happier living like you were before your husband came in the picture, then you might just not have enough in common to maintain that relationship.", "Are you 12? You need a parent,not a partner.", "YTA.  You need to take a hard look at yourself in the mirror and realize that your behaving like a spoiled brat.  How in the hell did you ever make it to adulthood?", "Soft YTA because it sounds like you have ADHD. There are so many amazing resources our there these days for women with ADHD and it feels like you aren't putting in any effort. Yes it sucks. I get it. Really.\n\nMy solution was a cleaning lady. I would rather work more and pay her than clean. I would rather have a root canal than clean to be fair. \n\nI read a dozen books on the subject and tried and failed at many many different solutions. \n\nI think any kind of effort on your part would go a long way.", "I think this is either a case of NAH or a very slight case of ESH. Here's my reasoning:\n\nOn your end, where most people will call you lazy, that's the lazy way to describe what I'd gather is mental illness. Which one, i couldn't begin to diagnose. But you were not put together (though i like your creative methods). Uppity really should seek some level of care for your mental health. Therapy can/ will help with that in the future. \n\nOn his end, it sounds like he's tried to help you and has just reached a point where he's exhausted. And it's not like he can just let you fail. You're married, that would affect you both. So he's had to basically parent his wife for your relationship. And then he's seeing it doesn't matter how much he tries, you're not changing. \n\nUltimately i think you seriously need therapy. Not only to help identify why you have those issues, but to stand a chance at working on them", "YTA, sounds like you want to play on the phone all day instead of taking on some adult responsibility.", "YTA. Instagram is not life and It\u2019s literally ruining it. Nothing good comes of social media. This is the only form of \u2018social media\u2019 I have. Life is so much better and clearer without it. At some point you\u2019ll step back and realize what you\u2019re missing in real life. You should be in present with the real people in your life who love you. Your husband sounds like a great guy, don\u2019t let your marriage slip away.

Your supposed partner in life. Instead you treat him like a maid and a human reminder. I left my ex for a plethora of reasons but one of the biggest ones was he was just like you. I left and never looked back. If you want this marriage to work, you're going to have to pull your weight, not just planning on it. Actually do it, and not just for a few days or a few weeks but forever.", "ESH. Seems like you didn't even know each other before getting married? You should probably part ways if you're that incompatible", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA.\n\nYou are a full time job, and it\u2019s a huge drain on your husband. Grow up, delete instagram, get on your meds, and stop being lazy and useless.", "NAH- It doesn't make you an asshole, But you are basically admitting on Reddit that you don't think you are good enough for your husband. Get some therapy girl, Your husband must see the greatness in you or he wouldn't be there. If you think he is worth it than you will put in the extra effort.", "so you're like a 5 yo and he's a daddy. is that it? YTA\n\nhe's in need of a wife", "You are lazy and entitled. The fact that you think it's ok for him to let it all go shows how entitled and lazy you are. Be single and gross. YTA.", "Im not going to judge as I don't like judging, but my ex was like this and it was insanely mentally exhausting and draining. \n\nI done everything, cook, clean, wash stuff, fix stuff, everything. Only towards the end at one point she pretended to care and made a slight effort to clean, wash and cook, a handful of stuff for a month. But it was all fake and she ended up resenting me for asking her to do it.\n\nAll she cared to do was get takeaway 3/4 times a day, sit around on tiktok and Instagram and stay in her comfort zone. Then complain that I do nothing for her and don't care about her wellbeing. She'd get black out drunk and try drive home and I'd have to physical stop her as I was scared for her to crash. She'd  come over, order takeaway, leave everything in the kitchen and not even put the remains in the bin, I'd have to do it. She would come over, make a mess, and leave, and thought it was ok to do so as we weren't married nor living together. Hell one time she even got a takeaway and didn't even ask me if I wanted something, knowing I hadn't eaten. \n\nIt's like being a full time parent. If you are going to act like such a lazy child. Don't be surprised if he leaves you. It's like being dead weight. It won't get your relationship anywhere. Your team is only as fast as the slowest person.", "YTA and I will be honest I hope he leaves you because he deserves a partner not a dependent child. I have severe ADHD and grew up very abused so I know I have to have calendars and reminders for everything but they are MY RESPONSIBILITY, not my child\u2019s, nor where they my late husbands. Grow up, be an adult and maybe you can be in a giving relationship with someone but I hope for his sake, he runs.", "OP, I see you're saying that you want to change in the comments. That's good. As someone who has been in your position, I feel I can give some advice. I have to ask though, because of the Adderall, do you have ADHD?\n\nI have ADHD. It's very difficult for me to manage, and at times is even crippling. Executive dysfunction is a symptom, where no matter how much you're screaming at yourself in your brain to just get up already and stop being this way, you just can't make your body move. It's a task that requires so much willpower you feel like you're going to die or mentally break if you try. You may not experience this, but this gives so insight into where I'm coming from.\n\nOne trick I learned is to never \"take a break\" or \"sit down for 5 minutes.\" When I get home from work, I do my chores, because once I enter Rest Mode I'm not getting back up. Do it all in one go and get it out of the way so that you can enjoy the rest of your free time without worry.\n\nAnother is music. Put some earbuds in and listen to whatever your Feel Good(tm) music is. I listen to upbeat music with a fast rhythm while I clean. Music gives me enough good vibes to just ignore that what I'm doing is a chore.\n\nThird, caffeine. Seriously. When you have ADHD, your brain struggles to produce enough dopamine. This leads to lethargy, among other things, when we aren't mentally stimulated enough, or when we've recently experienced sensory overload. Stimulants like caffeine and Adderall increase our dopamine levels, helping us feel motivated and energized. I need a lot of caffeine to feel functional without my meds, so I drink a lot of energy drinks. Can't advise it from a health perspective, but it's a common and efficient form of self medication. Even if you don't have ADHD, caffeine will still help you get some energy.\n\nAnother thing is to set some realistic goals for yourself. I struggle with my memory, so basically everything is an alarm in my phone. Dishes, laundry, sleeping, etc. Your goal in that case is to actually listen to the alarm, no putting it off or saying \"just a minute.\" When the alarm goes, get up and do it. Your goal doesn't have to be \"be perfect immediately\", it can be as simple as making an alarm system for your chores and sticking to it. If you miss an alarm once in a while and your husband has to remind you, you just express an apology, say that you forgot, and then go do it now.\n\nFinally, work with your husband on this. My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years, and we've worked out a couple systems. She's ADHD as well, and also struggles with executive dysfunction. What we've learned though is that we love making each other happy. When I KNOW I should do the dishes, but I just can't bring myself to care enough to do it, I ask her to tell me to do the dishes. Similarly, she'll ask me to tell her to clean her dorm. It's a lot easier to just say \"okay\" to cleaning when it's coming from something that isn't your brain.\n\nSometimes you're not just lazy. We've all got things we struggle with in life.  Hope this helps OP.", "You guys are 2 extremes. He seems overly concerned about cleaning but you are a disaster. It\u2019s not just that you aren\u2019t on his level of cleanliness but it sounds like you would rather live in filth than step up to at least a reasonable level. I think you both need to compromise & you need to stop making excuses for being lazy. You\u2019re an adult. Stop expecting someone else to take care of everything for you.", "You were never fully functional.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound functional at all.\n\nYTA. The man needs a partner, not a potato", "You don't need a higher dose of anything. You just don't care and don't think it's important. Adults find all those things important and for you it's scrolling the fake life of IG. He will leave you because I can't see anyone staying with you. It's probably a good thing so you can live the way you want . Homeless and alone", "[deleted]", "I can't help feeling this is above reddits pay grade.... Good luck though!", "It's hard to say from this whether his standards are too high or yours are too low (and that's not an insult; it's okay to live with dusty windowsills if that doesn't matter to you, but other chores of course are essential.) So I'm not going to render judgement. But I recommend couples counseling to help you two figure out whether it's possible to balance chores comfortably. Maybe shifting duties around so that you're handling things you don't mind as much would make it easier for you to contribute and give him better control over the things he feels are critical.\n\nI'm not sure what the pedal control thing you're talking about is, though. If it lets him see or control how fast you're driving, that's a BIG red flag. He can tell you what he thinks, but you're an adult and can ultimately decide how to drive for yourself.  If he really is using something to control your driving, I suspect all his \"you should do X\" around the house is overbearing and possibly abusive, too. A therapist could also help you see this more clearly.", "NAH\n\nI went through and read all of the comments and your responses, and I think I have a handle on this problem. Your mental illness is complicating things, and your relationship has thrown new spins on stuff you thought you had sorted out.\n\nI'm not going to give anyone a hard time about housecleaning, because I am the worst. I mean, not unhygienic or anything, but it's certainly dusty AF in this house. The thing is, it doesn't bother my spouse of 30 years, so it's not an issue. It does bother your spouse, and that's where you have to find a way to step up. (Although daily dishwashing and weekly laundry is a good idea, just see if you can get into that routine, it feels nice!)\n\nConsidering your diagnoses, executive dysfunction is definitely your enemy. There is some good advice in this thread from people who know how it feels. I have a kid with Depression, and all of his friends seem to have ADHD or other neurodiversities, so I have been around it in various stages of treatment. One of them finds Adderall helpful, one of my best friends actually finds Ritalin a lifesaver (which is apparently rare in adults to find help with that particular RX). The thing is, it took time to figure out which med works with the least amount of side effects. It is important to have a good medical team! It's getting better in regards to women with neurodiversity, who are so often misdiagnosed or ignored because they \"don't fit the diagnostic criteria\", but it's not perfect. Hang in there!\n\nI don't know what the point of this long response is, except to let you know that this old mom is in your corner.", "This is a tough one, but I'd say NAH. The most interesting part of all of this to me is that your living styles are like oil and water, so how did you end up living together? Did he ever see your living situation prior to that happening and know that your style was a lot more loose than his?\n\nIn the end, it's going to take compromise\u2014from both of you towards a happy medium\u2014to make things work. It sounds like he does a lot for you, which I'm certain you appreciate, but he runs seemingly a tight ship and upholds a standard to which it might be unrealistic to hold you. And likewise, it would be great if you could do more, even if it's just taking care of yourself better so he can check that off of his list and not worry as much.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsounds like you and him may just not be fully compatible living in the same space if your level of how clean it needs to be to be comfortable is that vastly different", "Have you ever researched ADHD?

You also sound like you understand your problems but struggle to actively deal with them. Have you gone to therapy and really searched for the root of this? You say you are on adderall and were maybe gonna try a higher dosage, this is a good plan. But you should also dig deeper into why you feel like this, maybe you\u2019ve got an undiagnosed disorder, maybe you need vyvanse or Ritalin instead of adderall, maybe you need to build up a routine including therapy. Look into executive dysfunction as a concept cuz it also sounds like that is what you struggle with (maybe, I am really playing Reddit armchair therapist right now). \n\nUltimately I think you need to look into how to support yourself in a way that makes yours, and his, lives easier. You gotta learn to work with your brain in particular, everyone has different things that work for them.", "NAH", "I might be an outlier here, but I'm going with NAH.

It never works out.", "ESH.

The parts that impact his life, and the house that he lives in with you, he has every right to ask be different. \n\nYou, meanwhile, are taking a great deal from him without giving back, which is why you're also the AH.  And both of you are unwilling to compromise. You probably shouldn't be trying to live together -- you're too different in a critical way that neither one of you is willing to change.

You might not be doing every little thing around the house, but you're getting done what you can handle mentally, and there's nothing wrong with that. \nI'm the clean freak in my marriage. I know that I grew up in a far more strict and cleaner environment than what my husband did, he just isn't used to what my standards of clean are, and that's okay. He's developed better hygiene habits, physically and our living space, since we've been together. Because I'm patient with him. That's the kind of thing we're supposed to do in a marriage. \nThere's always room for improvement, but he knew what he signed up for \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if he wasn't ready to help his life partner through it then what's it all for?", "NTA - but quite silly for posting here instead of the adhd sub.

Which is not healthy for either of you. \n\n- Stop letting him have a say on how you cycle home. Just stop. Claim your life back here at least. \n\n- Put IG back on your phone & do some damn research into your own adhd so that you understand why having some \u201cbrain downtime\u201d each day is so essential. \n\n  - (But also figure out how to self-limit it, so you also get stuff done.)\n\n- Push back on some of his unrealistic cleaning standards. \n\n  - when I got together with my current partner we had to negotiate the same. He soothed his anxiety by cleaning. So the more stressed he was, the more he needed things to be ridiculously tidy / clean. \n\n  - before I moved in with him full time I explained the choices were: he did All The cleaning, or we hired a cleaner. There was no third option where I did half. \n\n  - he does most of the washing up - but then when I lived alone I ONLY owned things that could go in the dishwasher.

I wasn't perfect, but I was functioning. \nI hated putting clothes on hangers or folding them so I shoved them into dresser drawers.\nSometimes I just left them in the bag.\nI hated laundry baskets so whenever clothes were dirty I'd just put them straight into the washing machine, wait until it was full, then wash em.\nI hated doing dishes so I would clean everything right after. If I used a lot all at once I would wash one every time I came to the kitchen until they were done.\nI was a terrible cook and a binge eater, but I managed. \nI Deep cleaned ~once every few months.\nI spent a lot of time on ig.\n\nIn comes my husband. \nHe's very neat & organized & a wonderful cook. \nA huge issue that's always been a part of our relationship is his need to clean.\nI was not raised to be super anal about it, but I love him & I've committed to doing the dishes every single day, vacuuming, dusting, & taking out trash every single weekend.\nMy husband deep cleans our shower, toilet, sinks, floors, counters, the trim, windows, AND balcony every week. He washes & hangs up all of our clothes.\n\nI'm bad w/ money so he's been in charge of paying off debt & financing everything. \nI'm bad about my diet so He's been meal planning/prepping for me.\nHe's been trying to get me to use pedal assist 1 or 2 on my bike every day when I come home from work.\nHe got me to delete ig from my phone. \nI was getting stressed at work so I requested part time, so he suggested I only get vto twice a month (vto is voluntary time off that gets released daily at my job)\nI became POA for my nana and he says \"we both know\" that he's gonna be the one doing most if the work for her since I'm so bad with money. (She just wants me to be poa so I can help her w/ her will and signing docs since she's blind, I'm not actually doing anything with her money)\n\nI'm grateful for him.\nBut he says he can't live his life like this. \nHe says he hates having to tell me to get off instagram all the time after I told him I'd delete it, of reminding me to take my medicine all the time. We actually DO both know I'd constantly forget if he didn't. I even have timers on my phone & I still forget. \n\nHe's sick of reminding me to use the pedal assist. I don't care about being more active than I already am, & he loves my body so that isn't it. As far as being healthy, his meal planning/prep has helped & he says he doesn't mind doing that for me. its all the little reminders he has to do. \nBut my point here is he diesnt HAVE to.\n\nHe doesn't HAVE to deep clean everything. He could just let me be on insta. He could just let me zoom home full throttle. He could just let some Chores go undone for a while. He doesn't have to help my nana.\n\nI feel ashamed I don't do more. HE does so I feel like I should to. I feel like a burden. But i cant say \"hey! You work so hard it makes me feel bad\" because that's stupid.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I, like your husband,  would find your decision not to step-up and take ownership unbearable. \n\nDoing what you want, when you want, ends for most of us by about  age 8. Being married to someone who doesn't do their share is a huge turn off for most people.", "NAH.\n\nI'm going to assume you have ADHD and potentially are on the spectrum.\n\nI get  your husband's frustration, because it's hard caring for someone when you don't understand what's going on in their brain, and you think that, if they just tried harder, things would be different.\n\nBut I'm AuDHD and I try so hard every day.  Sometimes things are successful and sometimes they're not.  I maintain a household and have three kids and mostly we exist on the edge of a catastrophe curve.  It only takes one tiny thing to tip us over into uncontrolled bedlam and it can take weeks or months to recover.\n\nStrict adherence to rigid routines works about 80% of the time.  Other times, I can't sit still or my brain is so focussed on something that I just CAN'T force myself away.  I want to.  There's a little part of my brain that's screaming at me, and it gets swallowed up by the ADHD part that says \"Fuck off, logical brain!  I don't care what you think because, until I know everything there is to know about the genetics of nudibranches, nothing is going to get done.  Ha!\"  It's awful and frustrating and it makes me feel like shit because it affects the people around me as well.  When your 14 year old daughter comes and takes your phone every morning so you don't get distracted before you've had a chance to take your meds and get into the routine of the day, you know things are crap.\n\nAll I can suggest is you take another look at your meds (if you haven't already) and try a  new therapist.  I have slap bands now that I write my to do list on, so I have it in front of me all the time.  My son has a springy bracelet with tags that flap around an annoy him, so he does the task to get rid of the tags.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that either.", "I'm lazy. Not just lazy, but super lazy, like it's a super power. Still, I set reminders on my phone, and timers for certain things (like so I don't forget to move the washed clothes into the dryer).

I'm no doctor, so I wouldn't hazzard a guess. She needs to look into it, get what she needs, and then actually get off her ass when the phone says \"do something\" and go do it.

It's embarrassing to admit this but I actually had no idea it needed to be done that often. I thought once every three months was being proactive but I think that's just the way I was raised, plus I was always depressed when I was younger so I hardly got around to making anything dirty outside of laying in my bed all day or going to work. Thank you for letting me know.", "This for sure. Something is going on here (based on personal experience + the creative solutions around getting chores done I'd guess ADHD but could be many things) and whilst it's totally ok to find these things hard, it's not ok to rely on someone else to fully do it for you. (E.g. taking care of money can be learned?) They need to get some therapy and figure out how both of them are feeling and what they can do about it, because this feels like it doesn't need to be the end of the relationship.", "People change over time, in this case our habits didn't change, just how we see them.

Once the depression is under control, you may find you respond much better to the ADHD meds. I wish you both good luck!", "This.

Hopefully this post is the catalyst for change that she needs to get started.", ">Not everyone has the benefits of medication and therapy, and sometimes even those things aren't enough. \n\nWhat do you mean...that's it?? You either do therapy or get on meds..or both...that's it??\n\nI'm not going to feel sorry for someone who's spent years letting someone that she loves pick up the slack. She knows what is wrong with her but she just sits there and does nothing. Some of us don't have the luxury to have people do everything for us, or have the $$ for therapy or meds. \n\nStop infantilizing her. She's an adult. She may not have it all together clearly, but she's not trying as evidenced by what SHE wrote:\n\n>My husband told me he doesn't think he can be in a relationship with me if I don't change.\n\nCLEARLY he's frustrated. Clearly she's not pulling her weight. It sounds like OP wants comfort rather than a kick in the ass which is clearly what she needs.\n\nOP you are so much smarter and more powerful than you give yourself credit for, and until you realize that, you won't change. Get on/more meds, look at resources online, join support groups, etc. You don't have to live like this.", "Have some empathy, then.", "It\u2019s also hard to get right now. Rationing isn\u2019t the worst idea.", "buddy I have ADHD and I'm medicated lol I know how it feels. I'm on Vyvanse though. \n\nbut that's why it's so important to work with your doctor when a certain medication doesn't work instead of just quitting and being like, huh, oh well, I will no longer attempt to function", "Sorry man but if someone\u2019s idea of \u201cchanging you\u201d is wanting you to take your medicine, wanting you to eat right, wanting you to clean up after yourself, and you refuse, YOURE the asshole in the situation. Fuck all that \u201cthis is how I am\u201d noise. She\u2019s TA", "I like to live on the edge", "Um. They\u2019re married. I think they might be a couple.", "oh for sure! I didn't mean to be dismissive or anything. I found another comment of hers and she said she didn't like it because it made her feel tired, so she quit. \n\nwhich is a total ADHD thing to do, but the right thing to do would be to talk to her doctor to adjust the dose... there are so many more treatment options other than adderall.", "Sounds like important to me...."]}
