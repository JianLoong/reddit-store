I wasn't perfect, but I was functioning. \nI hated putting clothes on hangers or folding them so I shoved them into dresser drawers.\nSometimes I just left them in the bag.\nI hated laundry baskets so whenever clothes were dirty I'd just put them straight into the washing machine, wait until it was full, then wash em.\nI hated doing dishes so I would clean everything right after. If I used a lot all at once I would wash one every time I came to the kitchen until they were done.\nI was a terrible cook and a binge eater, but I managed. \nI Deep cleaned ~once every few months.\nI spent a lot of time on ig.\n\nIn comes my husband. \nHe's very neat & organized & a wonderful cook. \nA huge issue that's always been a part of our relationship is his need to clean.\nI was not raised to be super anal about it, but I love him & I've committed to doing the dishes every single day, vacuuming, dusting, & taking out trash every single weekend.\nMy husband deep cleans our shower, toilet, sinks, floors, counters, the trim, windows, AND balcony every week. He washes & hangs up all of our clothes.\n\nI'm bad w/ money so he's been in charge of paying off debt & financing everything. \nI'm bad about my diet so He's been meal planning/prepping for me.\nHe's been trying to get me to use pedal assist 1 or 2 on my bike every day when I come home from work.\nHe got me to delete ig from my phone. \nI was getting stressed at work so I requested part time, so he suggested I only get vto twice a month (vto is voluntary time off that gets released daily at my job)\nI became POA for my nana and he says \"we both know\" that he's gonna be the one doing most if the work for her since I'm so bad with money. (She just wants me to be poa so I can help her w/ her will and signing docs since she's blind, I'm not actually doing anything with her money)\n\nI'm grateful for him.\nBut he says he can't live his life like this. \nHe says he hates having to tell me to get off instagram all the time after I told him I'd delete it, of reminding me to take my medicine all the time. We actually DO both know I'd constantly forget if he didn't. I even have timers on my phone & I still forget. \n\nHe's sick of reminding me to use the pedal assist. I don't care about being more active than I already am, & he loves my body so that isn't it. As far as being healthy, his meal planning/prep has helped & he says he doesn't mind doing that for me. its all the little reminders he has to do. \nBut my point here is he diesnt HAVE to.\n\nHe doesn't HAVE to deep clean everything. He could just let me be on insta. He could just let me zoom home full throttle. He could just let some Chores go undone for a while. He doesn't have to help my nana.\n\nI feel ashamed I don't do more. HE does so I feel like I should to. I feel like a burden. But i cant say \"hey! You work so hard it makes me feel bad\" because that's stupid.", "created_utc": 1679348818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wx46e/aita_for_not_pulling_my_weight_around_the/", "score": 616, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound like my ex. I spent 4 years picking up after him, trying to get him to help me clean around the house. He would constantly have amazon packages arriving and would open the boxes and throw the box and packaging into the living room, I'm not swimming in boxes cause I took them to the recycle. I tried to force him into helping me by making each of us have responsibilities ( I cook he does the dishes etc) and he always failed to do his side of things.

Honestly your husband would be way better off without you dragging him down.", "An update to respond to some things in the comments: yes I have adhd. And depression. The executive dysfunction in my life is terrible. When my depression is at its worst I can take 6 hour long depression baths, and my executive dysfunction is so bad I won't even run the water to reheat it. Based on the replies I gather I am the asshole here. I hated taking Adderall because it made me feel sleepy all the time, but I'm gonna try discussing more options with my doctor. We are different, but we love each other, and that's why we're together. He told me this because it's something I need to work on to stay together, and that's okay.

You seem to accept that you can\u2019t handle your own finances. You took on your grandma as your responsibility knowing that he will be the one dealing with it because you don\u2019t even deal with your own. \n\nAnd your standards of cleaning are gross. Trash should be taken out AT LEAST every weekend and realistically more may be necessary. Dishes should be done daily, not just one when you walk into the kitchen. Deep cleaning like shower, toilet, sinks, floors, counters should all be done weekly. Not every few months. Honestly your cleaning standards are what make you the asshole\n\nEnjoy living in your filth and poor financial decisions when he leaves you because that what he means when he says he can\u2019t live like this anymore", "No, he doesn't have to help you with anything  He could just leave instead.

You can clearly see everything that's wrong and are not doing anything about it", "Ok, I think you need to hear this in the most kind way possible, hon: Yes, YTA\n\nOp, he clearly loves you because he has been carrying the mental load for awhile: bills to pay, when to pay, make dinner, buy groceries, etc.\n\nAnd then he\u2019s doing ALL the work. Like this is what most women complain about! They are going to work, taking care of the kids, and then going to work full or part time. All the while their lazy husbands do nothing. And talk about weaponized incompetence- I don\u2019t like to do it, so I don\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re right. He doesn\u2019t have to do it, but clearly if he doesn\u2019t, who is? How long before you have ants in the sink? And whose going to deal with it? Not you! Clearly! \n\nI get you may have some issues to work though. As someone with anxiety. I too do the social media death scrolling. But I still cook. Do dishes. Laundry. Take care of my own bills. Despite having a significant other who shares the work! But the key there is share! We both do things! If he cooks, I do the dishes. If he packs up the groceries, you bet ya, I\u2019m paying. I do the laundry, he takes out the trash. We share in the household duties!\n\nJust because you may have some issues- and I would seek counseling either way (because you need some empathy for your partner or he\u2019s out)- but these can be signs of depression or serious mental health issues. Keep in mind, mental illness can sometimes explain you behaviors, hon. But they aren\u2019t an excuse.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s time to step up and be a partner. Or accept you\u2019re going to be single!", "This sounds exhausting. Not only does he work and clean  but he has to take care of your mental load. When can he calm down and relax?", "I mean it sounds like your husband married a kid.  So yeah, technically YTA for not being a functioning adult in any way. I can understand why he isn't happy. \n\nBut the bigger questions are why are you like this? (Does your medication have an effect?) And do you actually want to change?  Because if you are happier living like you were before your husband came in the picture, then you might just not have enough in common to maintain that relationship.", "Are you 12? You need a parent,not a partner.", "YTA.  You need to take a hard look at yourself in the mirror and realize that your behaving like a spoiled brat.  How in the hell did you ever make it to adulthood?", "Soft YTA because it sounds like you have ADHD. There are so many amazing resources our there these days for women with ADHD and it feels like you aren't putting in any effort. Yes it sucks. I get it. Really.\n\nMy solution was a cleaning lady. I would rather work more and pay her than clean. I would rather have a root canal than clean to be fair. \n\nI read a dozen books on the subject and tried and failed at many many different solutions. \n\nI think any kind of effort on your part would go a long way.", "I think this is either a case of NAH or a very slight case of ESH. Here's my reasoning:\n\nOn your end, where most people will call you lazy, that's the lazy way to describe what I'd gather is mental illness. Which one, i couldn't begin to diagnose. But you were not put together (though i like your creative methods). Uppity really should seek some level of care for your mental health. Therapy can/ will help with that in the future. \n\nOn his end, it sounds like he's tried to help you and has just reached a point where he's exhausted. And it's not like he can just let you fail. You're married, that would affect you both. So he's had to basically parent his wife for your relationship. And then he's seeing it doesn't matter how much he tries, you're not changing. \n\nUltimately i think you seriously need therapy. Not only to help identify why you have those issues, but to stand a chance at working on them", "YTA, sounds like you want to play on the phone all day instead of taking on some adult responsibility.", "YTA. Instagram is not life and It\u2019s literally ruining it. Nothing good comes of social media. This is the only form of \u2018social media\u2019 I have. Life is so much better and clearer without it. At some point you\u2019ll step back and realize what you\u2019re missing in real life. You should be in present with the real people in your life who love you. Your husband sounds like a great guy, don\u2019t let your marriage slip away. We all have to make compromises in relationships. \nI have trouble remembering to take meds as well and as dumb as it sounds, my Apple watch helps \ud83d\ude12", "YTA. He's your husband. Your supposed partner in life. Instead you treat him like a maid and a human reminder. I left my ex for a plethora of reasons but one of the biggest ones was he was just like you. I left and never looked back. If you want this marriage to work, you're going to have to pull your weight, not just planning on it. Actually do it, and not just for a few days or a few weeks but forever.", "ESH. Seems like you didn't even know each other before getting married? You should probably part ways if you're that incompatible", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA.\n\nYou are a full time job, and it\u2019s a huge drain on your husband. Grow up, delete instagram, get on your meds, and stop being lazy and useless.", "NAH- It doesn't make you an asshole, But you are basically admitting on Reddit that you don't think you are good enough for your husband. Get some therapy girl, Your husband must see the greatness in you or he wouldn't be there. If you think he is worth it than you will put in the extra effort.", "so you're like a 5 yo and he's a daddy. is that it? YTA\n\nhe's in need of a wife", "You are lazy and entitled. The fact that you think it's ok for him to let it all go shows how entitled and lazy you are. Be single and gross. YTA.", "Im not going to judge as I don't like judging, but my ex was like this and it was insanely mentally exhausting and draining. \n\nI done everything, cook, clean, wash stuff, fix stuff, everything. Only towards the end at one point she pretended to care and made a slight effort to clean, wash and cook, a handful of stuff for a month. But it was all fake and she ended up resenting me for asking her to do it.\n\nAll she cared to do was get takeaway 3/4 times a day, sit around on tiktok and Instagram and stay in her comfort zone. Then complain that I do nothing for her and don't care about her wellbeing. She'd get black out drunk and try drive home and I'd have to physical stop her as I was scared for her to crash. She'd  come over, order takeaway, leave everything in the kitchen and not even put the remains in the bin, I'd have to do it. She would come over, make a mess, and leave, and thought it was ok to do so as we weren't married nor living together. Hell one time she even got a takeaway and didn't even ask me if I wanted something, knowing I hadn't eaten. \n\nIt's like being a full time parent. If you are going to act like such a lazy child. Don't be surprised if he leaves you. It's like being dead weight. It won't get your relationship anywhere. Your team is only as fast as the slowest person.", "YTA and I will be honest I hope he leaves you because he deserves a partner not a dependent child. I have severe ADHD and grew up very abused so I know I have to have calendars and reminders for everything but they are MY RESPONSIBILITY, not my child\u2019s, nor where they my late husbands. Grow up, be an adult and maybe you can be in a giving relationship with someone but I hope for his sake, he runs.", "OP, I see you're saying that you want to change in the comments. That's good. As someone who has been in your position, I feel I can give some advice. I have to ask though, because of the Adderall, do you have ADHD?\n\nI have ADHD. It's very difficult for me to manage, and at times is even crippling. Executive dysfunction is a symptom, where no matter how much you're screaming at yourself in your brain to just get up already and stop being this way, you just can't make your body move. It's a task that requires so much willpower you feel like you're going to die or mentally break if you try. You may not experience this, but this gives so insight into where I'm coming from.\n\nOne trick I learned is to never \"take a break\" or \"sit down for 5 minutes.\" When I get home from work, I do my chores, because once I enter Rest Mode I'm not getting back up. Do it all in one go and get it out of the way so that you can enjoy the rest of your free time without worry.\n\nAnother is music. Put some earbuds in and listen to whatever your Feel Good(tm) music is. I listen to upbeat music with a fast rhythm while I clean. Music gives me enough good vibes to just ignore that what I'm doing is a chore.\n\nThird, caffeine. Seriously. When you have ADHD, your brain struggles to produce enough dopamine. This leads to lethargy, among other things, when we aren't mentally stimulated enough, or when we've recently experienced sensory overload. Stimulants like caffeine and Adderall increase our dopamine levels, helping us feel motivated and energized. I need a lot of caffeine to feel functional without my meds, so I drink a lot of energy drinks. Can't advise it from a health perspective, but it's a common and efficient form of self medication. Even if you don't have ADHD, caffeine will still help you get some energy.\n\nAnother thing is to set some realistic goals for yourself. I struggle with my memory, so basically everything is an alarm in my phone. Dishes, laundry, sleeping, etc. Your goal in that case is to actually listen to the alarm, no putting it off or saying \"just a minute.\" When the alarm goes, get up and do it. Your goal doesn't have to be \"be perfect immediately\", it can be as simple as making an alarm system for your chores and sticking to it. If you miss an alarm once in a while and your husband has to remind you, you just express an apology, say that you forgot, and then go do it now.\n\nFinally, work with your husband on this. My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years, and we've worked out a couple systems. She's ADHD as well, and also struggles with executive dysfunction. What we've learned though is that we love making each other happy. When I KNOW I should do the dishes, but I just can't bring myself to care enough to do it, I ask her to tell me to do the dishes. Similarly, she'll ask me to tell her to clean her dorm. It's a lot easier to just say \"okay\" to cleaning when it's coming from something that isn't your brain.\n\nSometimes you're not just lazy. We've all got things we struggle with in life.  Hope this helps OP.", "You guys are 2 extremes. He seems overly concerned about cleaning but you are a disaster. It\u2019s not just that you aren\u2019t on his level of cleanliness but it sounds like you would rather live in filth than step up to at least a reasonable level. I think you both need to compromise & you need to stop making excuses for being lazy. You\u2019re an adult. Stop expecting someone else to take care of everything for you.", "You were never fully functional.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound functional at all.\n\nYTA. The man needs a partner, not a potato", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "I can't help feeling this is above reddits pay grade.... Good luck though!", "It's hard to say from this whether his standards are too high or yours are too low (and that's not an insult; it's okay to live with dusty windowsills if that doesn't matter to you, but other chores of course are essential.) So I'm not going to render judgement. But I recommend couples counseling to help you two figure out whether it's possible to balance chores comfortably. Maybe shifting duties around so that you're handling things you don't mind as much would make it easier for you to contribute and give him better control over the things he feels are critical.\n\nI'm not sure what the pedal control thing you're talking about is, though. If it lets him see or control how fast you're driving, that's a BIG red flag. He can tell you what he thinks, but you're an adult and can ultimately decide how to drive for yourself.  If he really is using something to control your driving, I suspect all his \"you should do X\" around the house is overbearing and possibly abusive, too. A therapist could also help you see this more clearly.", "NAH\n\nI went through and read all of the comments and your responses, and I think I have a handle on this problem. Your mental illness is complicating things, and your relationship has thrown new spins on stuff you thought you had sorted out.\n\nI'm not going to give anyone a hard time about housecleaning, because I am the worst. I mean, not unhygienic or anything, but it's certainly dusty AF in this house. The thing is, it doesn't bother my spouse of 30 years, so it's not an issue. It does bother your spouse, and that's where you have to find a way to step up. (Although daily dishwashing and weekly laundry is a good idea, just see if you can get into that routine, it feels nice!)\n\nConsidering your diagnoses, executive dysfunction is definitely your enemy. There is some good advice in this thread from people who know how it feels. I have a kid with Depression, and all of his friends seem to have ADHD or other neurodiversities, so I have been around it in various stages of treatment. One of them finds Adderall helpful, one of my best friends actually finds Ritalin a lifesaver (which is apparently rare in adults to find help with that particular RX). The thing is, it took time to figure out which med works with the least amount of side effects. It is important to have a good medical team! It's getting better in regards to women with neurodiversity, who are so often misdiagnosed or ignored because they \"don't fit the diagnostic criteria\", but it's not perfect. Hang in there!\n\nI don't know what the point of this long response is, except to let you know that this old mom is in your corner.", "This is a tough one, but I'd say NAH. The most interesting part of all of this to me is that your living styles are like oil and water, so how did you end up living together? Did he ever see your living situation prior to that happening and know that your style was a lot more loose than his?\n\nIn the end, it's going to take compromise\u2014from both of you towards a happy medium\u2014to make things work. It sounds like he does a lot for you, which I'm certain you appreciate, but he runs seemingly a tight ship and upholds a standard to which it might be unrealistic to hold you. And likewise, it would be great if you could do more, even if it's just taking care of yourself better so he can check that off of his list and not worry as much.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsounds like you and him may just not be fully compatible living in the same space if your level of how clean it needs to be to be comfortable is that vastly different", "Have you ever researched ADHD? I'm getting those vibes but I don't want to put words in your mouth. \n\nI think you two need to have a long talk about whats feasible for you to do vs what he wants/needs. \n\nCleaning is a part of life but he seems to excessively clean.

You also sound like you understand your problems but struggle to actively deal with them. Have you gone to therapy and really searched for the root of this? You say you are on adderall and were maybe gonna try a higher dosage, this is a good plan. But you should also dig deeper into why you feel like this, maybe you\u2019ve got an undiagnosed disorder, maybe you need vyvanse or Ritalin instead of adderall, maybe you need to build up a routine including therapy. Look into executive dysfunction as a concept cuz it also sounds like that is what you struggle with (maybe, I am really playing Reddit armchair therapist right now). \n\nUltimately I think you need to look into how to support yourself in a way that makes yours, and his, lives easier. You gotta learn to work with your brain in particular, everyone has different things that work for them.", "NAH", "I might be an outlier here, but I'm going with NAH.

The parts that impact his life, and the house that he lives in with you, he has every right to ask be different. \n\nYou, meanwhile, are taking a great deal from him without giving back, which is why you're also the AH.  And both of you are unwilling to compromise. You probably shouldn't be trying to live together -- you're too different in a critical way that neither one of you is willing to change.

You might not be doing every little thing around the house, but you're getting done what you can handle mentally, and there's nothing wrong with that. \nI'm the clean freak in my marriage. I know that I grew up in a far more strict and cleaner environment than what my husband did, he just isn't used to what my standards of clean are, and that's okay. He's developed better hygiene habits, physically and our living space, since we've been together. Because I'm patient with him. That's the kind of thing we're supposed to do in a marriage. \nThere's always room for improvement, but he knew what he signed up for \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if he wasn't ready to help his life partner through it then what's it all for?", "NTA - but quite silly for posting here instead of the adhd sub. And for not mentioning in your post that all of the things you do / don\u2019t do are symptoms of your adhd. \n\nYou are also a bit the AH to yourself because you have let you\u2019re husband\u2019s useful help spill over into giving up all control of your life to him. Which is not healthy for either of you. \n\n- Stop letting him have a say on how you cycle home. Just stop. Claim your life back here at least. \n\n- Put IG back on your phone & do some damn research into your own adhd so that you understand why having some \u201cbrain downtime\u201d each day is so essential. \n\n  - (But also figure out how to self-limit it, so you also get stuff done.)\n\n- Push back on some of his unrealistic cleaning standards. \n\n  - when I got together with my current partner we had to negotiate the same. He soothed his anxiety by cleaning. So the more stressed he was, the more he needed things to be ridiculously tidy / clean. \n\n  - before I moved in with him full time I explained the choices were: he did All The cleaning, or we hired a cleaner. There was no third option where I did half. \n\n  - he does most of the washing up - but then when I lived alone I ONLY owned things that could go in the dishwasher. He owns many \u201cnicer\u201d things that must be hand-washed. (He used to hand wash practically everything - I\u2019ve negotiated compromises on half his stuff!) \n\n  - he has done therapy / the necessary work to get a better handle on his anxiety - so he has been able to drop the too-high standards.

I wasn't perfect, but I was functioning. \nI hated putting clothes on hangers or folding them so I shoved them into dresser drawers.\nSometimes I just left them in the bag.\nI hated laundry baskets so whenever clothes were dirty I'd just put them straight into the washing machine, wait until it was full, then wash em.\nI hated doing dishes so I would clean everything right after. If I used a lot all at once I would wash one every time I came to the kitchen until they were done.\nI was a terrible cook and a binge eater, but I managed. \nI Deep cleaned ~once every few months.\nI spent a lot of time on ig.\n\nIn comes my husband. \nHe's very neat & organized & a wonderful cook. \nA huge issue that's always been a part of our relationship is his need to clean.\nI was not raised to be super anal about it, but I love him & I've committed to doing the dishes every single day, vacuuming, dusting, & taking out trash every single weekend.\nMy husband deep cleans our shower, toilet, sinks, floors, counters, the trim, windows, AND balcony every week. He washes & hangs up all of our clothes.\n\nI'm bad w/ money so he's been in charge of paying off debt & financing everything. \nI'm bad about my diet so He's been meal planning/prepping for me.\nHe's been trying to get me to use pedal assist 1 or 2 on my bike every day when I come home from work.\nHe got me to delete ig from my phone. \nI was getting stressed at work so I requested part time, so he suggested I only get vto twice a month (vto is voluntary time off that gets released daily at my job)\nI became POA for my nana and he says \"we both know\" that he's gonna be the one doing most if the work for her since I'm so bad with money. (She just wants me to be poa so I can help her w/ her will and signing docs since she's blind, I'm not actually doing anything with her money)\n\nI'm grateful for him.\nBut he says he can't live his life like this. \nHe says he hates having to tell me to get off instagram all the time after I told him I'd delete it, of reminding me to take my medicine all the time. We actually DO both know I'd constantly forget if he didn't. I even have timers on my phone & I still forget. \n\nHe's sick of reminding me to use the pedal assist. I don't care about being more active than I already am, & he loves my body so that isn't it. As far as being healthy, his meal planning/prep has helped & he says he doesn't mind doing that for me. its all the little reminders he has to do. \nBut my point here is he diesnt HAVE to.\n\nHe doesn't HAVE to deep clean everything. He could just let me be on insta. He could just let me zoom home full throttle. He could just let some Chores go undone for a while. He doesn't have to help my nana.\n\nI feel ashamed I don't do more. HE does so I feel like I should to. I feel like a burden. But i cant say \"hey! You work so hard it makes me feel bad\" because that's stupid.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sometimes things are successful and sometimes they're not.  I maintain a household and have three kids and mostly we exist on the edge of a catastrophe curve.  It only takes one tiny thing to tip us over into uncontrolled bedlam and it can take weeks or months to recover.\n\nStrict adherence to rigid routines works about 80% of the time.  Other times, I can't sit still or my brain is so focussed on something that I just CAN'T force myself away.  I want to.  There's a little part of my brain that's screaming at me, and it gets swallowed up by the ADHD part that says \"Fuck off, logical brain!  I don't care what you think because, until I know everything there is to know about the genetics of nudibranches, nothing is going to get done.  Ha!\"  It's awful and frustrating and it makes me feel like shit because it affects the people around me as well.

My son has a springy bracelet with tags that flap around an annoy him, so he does the task to get rid of the tags.

Still, I set reminders on my phone, and timers for certain things (like so I don't forget to move the washed clothes into the dryer).

I'm no doctor, so I wouldn't hazzard a guess. She needs to look into it, get what she needs, and then actually get off her ass when the phone says \"do something\" and go do it.

It's embarrassing to admit this but I actually had no idea it needed to be done that often. I thought once every three months was being proactive but I think that's just the way I was raised, plus I was always depressed when I was younger so I hardly got around to making anything dirty outside of laying in my bed all day or going to work. Thank you for letting me know.", "This for sure. Something is going on here (based on personal experience + the creative solutions around getting chores done I'd guess ADHD but could be many things) and whilst it's totally ok to find these things hard, it's not ok to rely on someone else to fully do it for you. (E.g. taking care of money can be learned?) They need to get some therapy and figure out how both of them are feeling and what they can do about it, because this feels like it doesn't need to be the end of the relationship.", "People change over time, in this case our habits didn't change, just how we see them.

Once the depression is under control, you may find you respond much better to the ADHD meds. I wish you both good luck!", "This.

I handle finances, most of the cleaning, meal planning and cooking. We have very different standards of cleanliness. It has taken a lot of work, but we've figured out how to manage things in a way that works for both of us. \n\nFirst, you need to be better about handling your meds and your own shit. Figure out what works for you in order to make that happen. Get into routines. Leave notes for yourself. Building habits is really tough until it's engrained. Before bed at night, I set myself up for the morning, and at first that meant writing down what I wanted to do to get ready in the morning - I'd literally make a to-do list for myself before bed and tape it to the fridge. Now, I know what that list is and I do as much as I can to prepare myself for the morning. I lay out my clothes on my desk and I put all of my meds on top of my clothes so I can't get dressed without taking all of my meds. Just some examples.\n\nSecond, aside from the things you need to do for yourself, you need to sit down with your husband and figure out what he needs taken off his plate and which of those things you both can reasonably expect you to handle. Eventually, you can incorporate more things. \"I can't do any of them\" is not an option. You say he does too much, but you benefit from these things. And he needs them done. You need to help.\n\nI keep sticky notes, note pads, and calendars within easy reach all over the house so that the second I remember I need to do something or when we run out of something, it gets written down. Then at the end of every day, I gather these notes and make a to-do list for myself. \n\nHe has ADHD and i'm pretty sure I also do, but haven't been able to be diagnosed. I have to write everything down the second it pops in my head or my life falls apart. He needed an insane amount of reminders to do things before which was obviously hard with how jumbled my head always is, and eventually we've gotten to a point where he knows what he needs to do every day and I have my notes for reference, lol", "YTA, but get checked for ADHD.

You will no longer be in a fog. How much more easier it is to start chores and complete them and not procrastinate. You'll stop forgetting and know exactly where you left your keys. You'll be more organized. You will spend less time on Instagram because you will be aware of how much time you are spending on it instead of not realizing how long you are on it.

He never really loved you for who you *actually* are, and since he could *fix/change* you he has now realized that you are incompatible. \n\nYour husband should have seen the type of person you were while you were dating. He should have used that information to decide if he could handle living with someone who is messy, forgetful, eats unhealthy and spends all their time on the internet.

He doesn't want to accept a lower level of clean or being on top of stuff - certainly not as low as you would like.\n4.

It seems like you both will be better off parting ways. You may not be as well of as he will be on his own - you won't have someone taking care of all those things you were fine with letting him take care of.

If one does not work for you, the other might. \n\nOr there's others, like Wellbutrin that is not a stimulant, but that actually help many with ADHD. \n\nYou are a bit the asshole for putting everything on his should, all the mental load of the decisions.\n\nBut there are tools that can help you in little ways: downloading an app that puts apps in time out when you've been on it for more than x amount of time would help limit the doom scroll.\n\nNamed Alarms. Named Alarms EVERYWHERE! \nwhen you create a new alarm, you can name it. You need to do laundry later today? Put a \"LAUNDRY\" alarm for 7pm in your phone. You want to make sure to make xyz tonight before something goes bad, put an alarm for 5pm named \"COOK XYZ!!\"\n\nHell, I have a reminder that beeps evernight to remind me to go to bed (i'm a night owl, if I waited to be tired to go to bed, I wouldn't go before 3am or 4am)\n\nAutomate everything that you can. All my lamps are on timers as I keep forgetting to turn them off at night.\n\nThe one thing you can control is how you put things in place around you to help as much as possible. It is good that your husband can help... but you can't outsource everything on his shoulder.\n\nIt is so hard for others to understand how executive dysfunction can fuck us up.

You can\u2019t keep a clean house everyday but you can use technology to help you. If you know you need external motivation to do things, use that.

Less after your update (which you should put into your actual post btw). I'll write this from the perspective of someone who themselves is dealing with ADHD, with a partner who has ADHD and depression.\n\nYou can't be blamed for executive dysfunction, since it literally prevents you from doing things. That said, obviously there's things that could have been done differently, e.g you could have looked at other medication possibilities with your doctor, instead of just quitting. But as we know, hindsight is 20/20. What matters is you being open for learning, and how you move forward.\n\nIt's obvious you've been raised very differently. Even with ADHD and Depression, it sounds like your parents might not have gotten the memo, and could have accepted them as facts and taken that opportunity to get you proper help, and help you find ways to make your life work a little smoother. For example finding better ways to keep your home clean, without doing a deep clean every week. However, it might just as well be that your home growing up never was cleaned properly, never giving you the opportunity to learn how a home is properly maintained. You know that best ofcourse. But there's a clear difference in how you were raised, and it seems to me like your husband might not entirely understand nor accept that fact.\n\nHonestly, to me it sounds like your husband has a bit of a control problem. Helping you with your diet and cleaning your home is one thing, but simply telling you to get off IG, instead of properly raising concerns as to WHY he wants you to do that is a bit odd, as is the whole pedal assist thing. I get wanting you to be healthy, that just means he wants you to get the most out of your life, but I'm getting slight controlling behavior feelings. Giving you space is more important for your growth and well being. If you're constantly pushed, that pushing might quickly lead you into a corner where you don't feel like anything is within your own control. Which will just make your depression worse. Talk to him about giving you space and control over your decisions. A great rule of thumb is to ask him the question, \"does this directly affect your life in any way?\". If the answer is no, e.g with the pedal assist thing, then he has to drop it. It's your decision. I've used that myself when I notice I get a little to worked up about my fianc\u00e9es problems, that don't actually affect me, works great for me.\n\nADHD and depression do weird things to your body and mind. Especially when ADHD is the cause of your depression, which is very possible here. But in the end it's all about finding ways to make it work anyway. Medication, while it f-n sucks, is a great option. In combination with therapy it will help you understand your problem and find ways to do your everyday tasks more efficiently. \n\nWhen it comes to cleaning, remember that 2 minutes gets you pretty far. 2 minutes is a clean toilet, a clean sink, or a clean stove, or a cleared off table. Not everything has to be done at once. That mindset helped me a lot actually. I do one small thing every day, if I feel like it I'll do more, but just one thing a day keeps your home cleaner than you think.\n\nYou both seem like nice people, so take this opportunity to help each other grow and learn.", "Nta.\n\nHe doesn't need to do everything, nope.

If she cares about him at all, she needs to get help to fix these issues, medical or personal laziness.", "Why did he marry her when they are clearly severly incompatible?", "Well it sounds like she's always been like this.  He doesn't *have* to but what was he expecting?  I agree YTA but also he's just naive I guess.  Did he expect her to automatically change when she said \"I do\"?  She sounds like a lazy ass but that's what he chose to marry.  If he doesn't want to manage someone, don't marry someone who has to be managed?", "THIS. It's weaponized incompetence in pink. She does not get sympathy because she has ADHD. That boat has sailed, it's not like we haven't established this. And why isn't she on her meds?? She is not helping herself by having a pity party when she's hasn't done shit to make this better for her husband. I don't understand why people are coming to her emotional rescue like it's not her fault she can't even wipe her own ass. It's embarrassing. \n\nIt's her responsibility to manage herself so she can be an effective spouse. Period.", "Tbf, that\u2019s OP\u2019s point: he *doesn\u2019t* have to. He could just\u2026not.\n\nHowever, for several of the things mentioned, his \u201cnot\u201d may negatively impact their shared space. The laundry/cleaning are probably the most relevant issues. They may need to dive into that (ex. Laundry basket where OP doesn\u2019t have to see it every day, but OP loads washer and dryer, while hubby handles folding/putting away or something like that).\n\nThey may need to drop some of the other things though. I don\u2019t fully understand the pedal assist part, but it sounds like it only affects OP and isn\u2019t very important so maybe the hubs could drop that reminder. I personally think the IG thing might be an issue in ways OP hasn\u2019t considered (like maybe husband reminds OP to get off it because it\u2019s eating into their shared time together. If husband isn\u2019t interest in IG, it can feel very different than say OP even watching TV where there may be a show plot/premise they can discuss during/after as a couple).\n\nOther stuff doesn\u2019t sound as day-to-day, but OP should be careful about ignoring, particularly if they really will likely turn to their spouse for help if/when they come up (e.g. Nana\u2019s financials).\n\nI\u2019d still say YTA though because OP doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re trying to meet the husband halfway on most of these, they\u2019re just letting him handle them and getting annoyed at him for doing so without thinking about reasonable compromises.", "You have to accept people as they are. You have to see them as is instead of their potential. He\u2019s not a boyfriend. He married even though he knew these things about her. I feel it\u2019s something more the just the little things but then again, little things add up.", "She isn't undiagnosed. She has medication. She ignores her phone notifications to take her meds. She is _actively_ choosing to struggle.", "It depends on what you think of OP\u2019s account of the situation. If you\u2019re assuming that she\u2019s this way because she doesn\u2019t care, then I could see why you might think that. If you\u2019re taking what she\u2019s saying at face value - that she\u2019s struggling - then you might have more empathy. Just like being depressed and having trouble keeping up with all your shit doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, having severe executive functioning issues and having trouble keeping up with all your shit doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. That kind of thinking, that self hatred, keeps people from figuring out how to manage it. Just like with persistent depression, it\u2019s all about management. And learning how to do that takes effort and resources, like the ones I shared. It\u2019s doable, if you have guidance and understanding from people who get it.", "That includes going to therapy, trying different types of medications, reading books on how to help yourself, talking with your partner, setting up small systems that work. This person wants to spend all day on Instagram and be parented instead of a partner. These things take tons of time, but are necessary. \n\nIt's not our fault that we have ADD, but it is our responsibility to manage it as best as possible.", "Yeah next time I have a sinus infection I won't take a decongestant since symptoms don't ever need to be treated. Makes sense.", "Yes this was exactly what I was thinking which is making me sad with all the people calling her lazy. Like she had a system that worked for her and yeah it wasn\u2019t perfect or \u201cnormal\u201d but that\u2019s usually the way it is for people with ADHD. Executive dysfunction is a MAJOR issue and it feels exactly like OP describes where it\u2019s like \u201cI WANT to do the thing, I WANT to be helpful but I can\u2019t make myself do it!!\u201d And it\u2019s so frustrating and it makes you feel like you\u2019re useless and not normal. I feel bad for OP tbh.", "She forgets to take medicine even after setting reminders on her phone. This is on her. She needs to do better because she isn't a child. Her health is her responsibility.", "But what does she need time to relax from exactly? Relaxing implies there\u2019s non relaxing tasks/jobs/responsibilities and the way OP describes things she doesn\u2019t do/have any of those. She describes her life before as doing the bare minimum, not thriving - just skating really. I agree it sounds like they have different goals and wants but I hesitate to regard them as equally healthy or desirable. \n\nHis wants and goals enhance her life, hers (especially if he were to acquiesce) would make the both less healthy and productive. He has to insist on things because none of them would get done otherwise - that\u2019s not controlling, that\u2019s just loving healthily.", "She admits she would do one item of washing up at a time. I think that tells you everything you need to know about her work ethics", "If the genders were the other way around you would NOT be saying this.", "Lol \u2018goal\u2019 of being an animal wallowing in your own filth. Cool goal - sure she\u2019ll go far.", "As someone with ADHD, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say there\u2019s no such thing as lazy, though it\u2019s often mislabeled onto people with executive functioning issues. I will say, OP needs to get better meds if she\u2019s not functioning, but it sounds like he might be expecting more than she can handle even on meds. Too few spoons. They\u2019re just not compatible. \n\nMy stepbrother is lazy\u2014he is perfectly capable of taking care of himself when he\u2019s on his own, this has been proven, but he lives with his dad, goes to work for 6 hours (IT help desk, virtual) and immediately goes onto gaming after. Would rather bribe/pay his sister to do chores for him, bring him food from upstairs, etc. than do them, which is somewhat fine. She doesn\u2019t mind. But he is exceptionally lazy as a person. Living on his own, he had a clean apartment, laundry done regularly, etc. \n\nI have ADHD. I struggle a lot with daily tasks and physically can\u2019t get myself started on them. This didn\u2019t change when I moved into my apartment, because it couldn\u2019t. It only started getting better when I got diagnosed, and started meds. It\u2019s been a whole new world. I hate that people compare my stepbrother and I\u2019d reactions to independent living, when they were just not the same, at all. He always had the capability to take care of himself to our parents\u2019 standards, just doesn\u2019t want to. I had no capability to do it, and wanted to desperately, and did as soon as I started getting treatment. \n\nND people aren\u2019t lazy, but lazy people do exist", "As a lazy person, yes there is such a thing.", "Praise.", "Great advice. Nobody should ever improve themselves, and you certainly shouldn't want your SO to improve themselves. This is so wise. Thank you for your contribution.", "Should he also stop reminding her to take her medication?", "OP was on medication. She elected to stop taking it. She didn't talk to her doctor about changing her dose. She didn't ask for alternatives. She didn't speak to a therapist about management strategies. She just chose to stop taking the one thing that may have been helping, with no contingency plan. At a certain point she is actively deciding to not help herself, and even making explicit decisions to hurt herself in the executive functioning department. And she needs to be held accountable for that. Not coddled and told it's okay.", "Does it really make a difference? Like if she ignores reminders to do adult things so that she can keep scrolling ig is and the reason is that she has ADHD does that mean he should spend his life in this way?", ">Lmao in what world is regular cleaning activities extra clean an organized. He doesn't want things excessively cleaned every single day. He wants a normal amount of cleaning.\n\nAnd now I am here, reading this and asking myself if I am a dirty pig without ever realizing. \n\nBut is *deep cleaning* your trim (english is not my first language so I hope I am right with thinking what a \"trim\" is but it's that white thing at the bottom of your walls?), balcony and WINDOWS every single week really a \"normal amount of cleaning\"? If so I guess I failed life because I do this WAY less frequently.\n\nTo me husband sounds on the more excessive end of the spectrum while OP is without doubt a lazy bum. Bad combination.", "Exercise pushes it to ESH Id say\u2026", "Normal is relative! We are all comfortable with different levels of cleanliness and order. I hate people that use the word normal and think that boom! they\u2019ve instantly won the argument. Also, you can watch tv or Instagram all you want if you\u2019re an adult, you just have to set your priorities. This is like saying: if people don\u2019t live and suffer as much as I do they are wrong, because it\u2019s unfair! Or parents being mad at people without children because \u201cthey have not matured and made sacrifices\u201d. \nAs long as you don\u2019t hurt anyone, you can do what you want. \nThey are just not compatible, she might be lazy, but she is ok with her standards and living in a less than spotless house. He has different standards and its true that its unfair that he has to do most of the work to keep the house, but also HE CARES A LOT MORE! \nI don\u2019t see the relationship working, but I wouldn\u2019t put it on only one person. She might find someone similar to her and not feel guilty anymore. NAH", "I'm a wan and I think OP is lazy and plays the victim. I understand the husband and I would have left her in her disgusting place a long time ago.", "Imagine choosing to marry someone, knowing exactly who they are, knowing that you aren't on board with their actions and personality and then bitching about it like it's some kind of surprise. ESH", "If you think running a damp rag over the trim once a week is anal then I don't know what to tell you chief.", "Seconding this. If I'd been diagnosed as a kid I might not have a crippling anxiety disorder, might not have dropped out of university (twice), and might not have a long history of trying (and failing) to treat depression that may or may not have actually existed.", "I nearly offed myself because I felt so lazy and like I was falling behind because of an issue with ME. I don\u2019t get how anyone can be so casually cruel about others in their own community for struggling :(", "I agree with this, nobody is deep cleaning every day dude. Your last paragraph is right on the money. OP is somewhat YTA but mostly bad combination.", "To be fair, it doesn't sound like OP understands what deep cleaning is. It sounds like the husband does a normal amount of cleaning. When I mop (I aim for weekly but it's more like every 10 days) I always wipe the baseboards with the mop (what I believe you and OP are calling trim). You're already doing the floors with cleaning solution. What I'd call \"deep cleaning\" is to get down with a brush and cleaner and scrub out the cracks. Which I usually just do once a year because I just don't have the time or energy to do it more than that. It certainly sounds like the \"deep cleaning\" of the bathroom that OP describes is literally just normal weekly bathroom maintenance.", "If a man posted this the term \"bang maid\" would be all throughout the comments.", "This was another thought I had. Him assuming these responsibilities isn\u2019t helping her at all. I need reminders\u2014and sometimes someone on the phone to pressure me to do something, wake up, etc\u2014but can usually set a due date reminder and the stress will kick me into gear. \n\nShe also needs to get her meds re-evaluated. Doctors hate dosing properly, and ADHD meds can be finicky as hell.", "This was my experience only I did manage to finish my academic studies. With a great personal cost as the anxiety that came with uni paralyzed me for years until I started therapy. From the outside I was the person that could not be bothered with menial tasks and in the inside I was breaking apart over not being able to log on my internet banking to pay my bills or go buy groceries. Undiagnosed adhd is so impactful and while I am proud of myself for getting better I cannot be smug. The related issues will probably not go away entirely and the struggle is less but it will always be there. It is so easy to get lost in depression and addiction etc that I will always be very understanding to those that cannot deal. Receiving treatment as a child gives you skills and mental development that allows you to cope in a way that it is just not possible for me.", "It is survivors bias, I have noticed that people around me tend to do that if they had to deal with big problems in an early age. I was an anxious and depressed teen but since noone believed there was something wrong with me other than being lazy or difficult, my feelings were not validated and understood. If I was believed and diagnosed it would be society mistreating me and not my well meaning but ignorant parents. I believe there is a connection there. We have felt all the pain without knowing why so we are more empathetic", "There are a lot of people (usually parents of ND kids) who think that not having the diagnosis means not facing any stigma. Conveniently forgetting that the \"weird\" and \"lazy\" also face stigma, just a different kind. It doesn't matter who had it worse, no one wins in the suffering olympics, but it's important to acknowledge that no one had it easy.", "This dude wants her to use a pedal bike or whatever it's called a couple times a week. She self admittedly is lazy and spends all her time on her phone. He \"loves her body\" so it isn't an issue, doesn't mean she is healthy and doesn't mean he isn't lying to not hurt her feelings.\n\nYeah he's managing most of her life but it isn't him having boundary or control issues, it's her being a lazy fuck witb no executive functioning to speak of. He feels he has to manage her or she'll fall apart. He's trying to _help the woman he loves_ do better in life financially, health-wise, and general functioning-wise (like keeping a fucking house clean) and you're painting it as him being a fucking sadist.
