She needed encouragement to make an appointment to talk to her doctor, who if necessary (and you don't know if it is) could point her to professionals to appropriately address her dietary needs, both physical and in relation to her ED history.  She did not need a blanket *don't eat these bad foods* statement from her *concerned* partner, and then insistence when she, rightly, balked.\n\nSeriously, \"you're strong and can live without your 'comfort food'\" is extremely dangerous shit to be saying to someone recovering from an ED.  That's the kind of shit that gets thrown around in pro-Ana circles.\n\nEdit:  You also couched all this in \"I'll be really sad if you \\[don't restrict\\]\"?  OMG.", "YTA gastritis is treated with a combination of GI meds(for 6+ weeks) and possibly antibiotics depending on cause. Not diet. She needs to **make** time for the doctor before she ends up with a perforation/more severe issue.", "YTA. The priority needs to be her seeing the doctor. And I surely hope you're helping with the cleaning of the house that allegedly precludes her from seeing a doctor. Maybe you could take over the cleaning if she can see a doctor that day.", "Yes, YTA. While your intentions might be good, you are clearly overstepping your competence. Are you a physician or where did you get that confidence to diagnose your girlfriend? Do you know that there a different types of gastritis and that they have different treatments? Are you aware that stomach issues can have a myriad of underlying issues and conditions?\n\nYou're also saying that your girlfriend is cleaning the house on the only day she could see a doctor. Loosing that amount of weight in a short time is not normal and especially with her past history she needs to be evaluated by a professional ASAP.", "Why would anyone think suggesting a person in recovery from a known eating disorder restrict their intake, or refrain from eating foods they had worked through to feeling 'safe' about, is a good idea?\n\nThis is beyond clueless and well into YTA territory. YTA.\n\nAlso, unless she's absolutely *tiny* 100lbs really isn't likely to be a healthy weight for her. I think you like her skinny and are panicking/have realised you've provoked her into 'Oh shit' territory.", "I just want to throw out there that 100lbs is not usually a healthy weight. I\u2019m not a doctor and it could be definitely normal for her, especially if she\u2019s short. But 100lbs is super underweight for most women.", "Bruh... YTA\n\nWho are you to TELL her what to do?\n\nAre you a Dr? A nutritionist? NO!\n\nSo why are you giving out nutritional and medical advice?\n\nAnd then, on top of that, you emotionally manipulate her into following your advice! \"Oh I'll be really sad...\" But also \"But you're strong! You can do this!\"\n\nAre you a cult leader?", "YTA. You gave her medical advice that you're not qualified to give, to a person that suffers from an eating disorder. You 'insisted'. Yes, she may have had stomach issues, but they were HER stomach issues and at least she was eating something. You've shamed/guilted her into not eating the few things she allowed herself to eat. She had an ED (has an ED). Her stomach is fucked already because of that. She needs to be able to eat something, and you took away the few things she could by telling her she can't. You're not qualified to make that statement. That's why she needs to go see someone about it. Comfort food for her isn't the same as it is for you. It's food she can eat without feeling like she's a fat pig. (she's not, but ED is a mental health issue as much as it is a physical issue). You really fucked up here, and you need to back all the way off and bring her a fucking pizza.", "YTA. You\u2019re fucking sick. \u201cYou can live without your \u2018comfort (safe) foods\u2019.\u201d Sick as shit.", "YTA. You're not a medical doctor and gastritis comes in different forms. You should have gotten her to a doctor or let her google her symptoms and decide for herself which foods she'd eliminate from her diet.", "You really should try to encourage her to take time off to go to a doctor instead of providing your own medical advice. Especially given her history.", "YTA.  Your intentions are good, but you're not a doctor. Encourage her to see a doctor ASAP.", "YTA. You're girlfriend isn't \"fine\". Working 6-12hr shifts so that you don't have time to think about your health isn't fine - it may be a trauma response  and/or another way to not think about food or her body. I'm recovered from an eating disorder, not a doctor, but definitely have extensive experience around them and unless you're girlfriend is like 5ft 0in and tall, 100lbs likely isn't a healthy weight. The correct response would have been encouraging her to take a day off to see a doctor and making that a priority. Or cleaning the house for her on the day off so she can go.", "YTA- she needed a doctor and a nutritionist (likely one specializing in eating disorders). Instead you suggested she restrict her food intake in a severe way. Of course she's triggered. She's relapsed and you should feel bad about it.", "\u201cshe seemed really sad about that, told that\u2019s almost impossible but I insisted\u201d \n\nYTA. You INSISTED? That\u2019s not how it works. You don\u2019t get to dictate what your partner eats.", "YTA- You know NOTHING about stomach issues. If she went that fast back into her ED there might be a chance that her \u201csymptoms\u201d were made up. She just wanted a cover for slipping back into old habits. Habits that you clearly know NOTHING about. If she did have real symptoms her going back to restrictions on food as a way of controlling the situation might hide the real medical problem. Take her to the Doctor. Be in the waiting room. Show support. Dr google is bogus.", "YTA. You're not her doctor. You should not be giving such detailed instructions if you can't even be bothered to look at what she's actually eating.", "YTA.", "YTA. Unless you're a doctor, you don't get to dictate what she eats. Now she's severely underweight and you're mainly to blame. She could end up in the hospital. You should be ashamed of yourself. You didn't help her at all. You hurt her in a horrific way. Back the hell off and stop controlling her diet, asshole.", "YTA.\n\nYou better fucking apologize now and beg forgiveness, but I honestly hope she fucking leaves you, she deserves better and you do not deserve **anybody** with your attitude.\n\nI am actually sick to my stomach right now, you absolute monster.", "It doesn\u2019t matter AT ALL if you\u2019re the AH. Get your girlfriend back into therapy", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re not a doctor and had absolutely no right to direct her on what she should or should not be eating, especially when you know she has a history of anorexia.", "Dr. Google told her it was \"gastritis\" and told her to cut out her main foods. Wow. With her insane work schedule, dealing with BPD, a semi resolved ED, and a BF like that, it is probably stress related!", "YTA. Eating disorders are the mental illness with the highest death rate. You simply cannot fuck around with them. Even if you didn\u2019t know what would trigger her, if you were concerned about her eating, you should have noticed when she stopped eating, certainly before she lost 20 pounds. If you\u2019re going to care about her health, you actually have to care, not just insist on her cutting out foods and then go about your day.", "Not only are you not a doctor but YTA, too.", "Made her? As in did you give her no option/choice at all? Forced it rather than threw out \"Hey did you think about trying..........?\"", "YTA\n\nYou are not a doctor. She has a lot of mental and physical health stuff going on and you are not qualified to make any suggestions. \n\nThe only suggestion you should have made was for her to take a day off and go to the doctor. \n\nYou know she does things to please others. You told her to do something that would hurt her health. She did it. WTH is wrong with you? Stay in your lane.", "YTA and you are an abuser. Leave this woman alone so that she can try and just live. \n\nYou should not be anywhere near her.", "YTA \nI\u2019m going through almost the exact same thing your gf is. I\u2019m on an extremely restricted diet due to a diagnosed digestive issue that I\u2019m waiting for surgery to repair and it\u2019s seriously triggering to my disordered eating issues (not anorexia). \n\nYou should never have forced her into this. You are not her parent or her doctor. She clearly told you she didn\u2019t want to do it and you pushed her when you shouldn\u2019t have.", "Ah shit, I'm going NAH. Or light Y T A. \n\nYou absolutely should have had more awareness that eating disorders never go away. It's like addiction. You can be recovered, but it will always be there in the back of your mind.\n\nYou were well meaning, but *insisting* on significantly restricting (vs suggesting trying one at a time), and also not noticing for ages that she's lost weight.\n\nMan, you need to apologise profusely, and she needs medical help. Note: I don't know how tall she is, but 100 lbs is very light for a vast majority of people. 80 lbs is very concerning. This is serious, and you need to get off the internet and talk with her *now*. Eating disorders are fatal, man.", "YTA. Your girlfriend lost 20% of her body weight if the numbers you reported are accurate. That is severe malnutrition. She likely needs to get into inpatient level of care for weight restoration and further therapy (from an eating disorder dietitian). If she was only eating 5 foods like you report, she was not almost recovered; those were her safe foods that you told her to restrict. Your comments about her food choices are manipulating and upsetting. You NEED to get resources from her treatment team on how to best support her in recovery. Recommending dietary restrictions is never recommended unless it\u2019s by someone\u2019s medical team.", "NAH.   You have to be extraordinarily cautious when talking food issues with someone with a history of ED.   The bottom line is she needs to take an occasional half day or 3/4 day to see a doctor.   Just working isn't sustainable in general and more so when it means ignoring health issues.", "Oof, that's a tough spot to be in. There was no ill will on your part. I would focus less on wether you were the AH and more on how you can help her from here. \n\nAs of now, I'd say NAH but that might change depending on how you deal with the situation. \n\nMake time to cook for her or help in whatever capacity you can.  The first order of business should be having an honest conversation with her. Tell her your observations, that you love her and that your worried you words impacted her negatively. Go from there. She might need help again. If so, you can help her find the right people to talk to. \n\nBest of luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are a poison to this woman.", "about the house: i totally do, it's mostly on me tbh. she just does it because she feels like she needs to, and she also sleeps like 16 hours on that day so she doesn't really have a lot of time left, that's why it takes her a whole day. \n\nyes, now i will totally try to take her to see a doctor asap, i hope it'd be possible soon", "Called her safe foods her \"comfort foods\" and then told her she's \"strong enough\" to restrict them.

Her mother also being very thin is not necessarily a sign that it's natural for her, but more likely that disordered eating runs in the family.\n\nRegardless, 80 lbs is very, very light for you to only now be concerned. She had no fat to lose. I find it difficult to believe she doesn't have all her bones showing at this point.", "I guarantee you that is not at all the case that doctors tell her it's ok and normal, just her genetics. If they've said anything like that, they've praised her for getting to that weight because she was likely so underweight it could've killed her. If they told her that weight was healthy and fine, it's because it is such an improvement over where she was. My sister almost died from her anorexia and ED so many times I've lost count. \n\nIf you care even an iota for this girl, you are not someone she should be with. You're not just clueless or unthinking but you are so inexplicably out of touch and completely oblivious that you've helped land her back into a position where she's slowly killing herself in agony. And it took you a whole two fucking weeks before you even noticed. You are not a safe person for her to be around especially not now. You didn't just fuck up here this isn't a reddit aita post, this is a life or death potential issue that you are just making worse and worse. She needs help, support, safety, and security. You provide none of that. If you care at all for her, call someone that can and ask them to help and then just get out of there and leave her alone. \n\n\nIt also sounds like you'd been enabling her to already be sliding back into old behaviors for ages and then instead of showing any care or attention at all, you go and tell her that she's strong enough to cut out one of the five foods she eats and use words describing them as high calorie and fat and bad and tying it to her health? It is going to take years (if ever) to undo the pain and damage you caused unthinkingly because you didn't actually care about her just some version or idea of her. This entire situation sounds like someone trying to commit the most perfect murder and avoid getting caught by finding and psychologically attacking someone in RECENT/ Active ED recovery (which is always a lifelong process but it especially was not \"over and recovered\" just months later. \n\nIf this is real, call the poor girl's family or actual friends or honestly her doctor if you can't think of anyone else, and then just let her heal without this. You are not someone that she should be around at all especially at this moment. And you knew she was anorexic and hadn't seen her eat in weeks and saw her lose a fifth of her body weight before the thought even occurred to you? Holy fuck that is some next level lack of awareness", "\"I'd be really sad if...\" is so much worse. Now she's scared of disappointing you. You need to get help now.
