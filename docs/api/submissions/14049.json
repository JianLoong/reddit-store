My husband fits in to the dog people category of completely humanizing his animal and, in all reality, destroying the dog. He insists on the dog going everywhere with him/us. He brings her to job interviews, dump runs, laundry runs, grocery runs and has even brought her with us to the bar several times on our date nights. On the rare chance that he doesn't bring her, he is saying things like \"I wonder if she's thinking about me\" the whole time. Our relationship has been bulldozed by constantly having her with us. If she was calm and didn't have anxiety, it probably wouldn't bother me the way it does.\n\nHe has humanized and spoiled her to a point of her having anxiety if she is not physically on him. She whines constantly. If we are in the vehicle she whines because I'm sitting in the front seat instead of her. If we are trying to sleep, she is whining in her unlocked kennel, staring at us and wanting to get on the bed to sleep on him. If he puts his pants on she is literally climbing on him whining, as if to remind him not to forget to bring her wherever he is going. \n\nThis morning was already shit for me. I feel like trash (lack of sleep) and just wanted to go back to bed after getting our kid on the bus. I come back to find that he has gotten the dog on the bed, who takes up my full spot, snuggling her. So I'm already pissed but I just go lay on the couch (ongoing argument I didn't have energy for). He then gets up and starts loudly talking to her, \"burping her\" after she eats and \"aww da baby needs da burpies\". I'm touched out. He asks me to go with him to run errands and starts getting her jacket on. I say no. Not going. I had planned to but not if the dog goes. He said there's no point leaving her home. Why would he if he could bring her? I told him to go without me then. I'm not sitting through the constant whining. He says I'm an AH for \"blatantly showing how much I hate his dog\" and says he needs my help. I told him to have the dog help him. AITA?\n\nQuick ETA: I came before the dog, before anyone starts asking. We have been together 7 years and he came home with this dog 2 years ago because he got her for free; after it was already established that we would wait until we bought our own home.", "created_utc": 1680699523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cjjpj/aita_for_refusing_to_run_errands_with_him_because/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love my dog and had her before meeting my husband, but this is too too much. Also, the dynamic changed a lot when we had kids so it\u2019s kind of alarming that you already have a kid and this prioritization still happens. Dogs with separation anxiety need help too, it\u2019s not healthy to enable it.", "NTA - Your husband needs therapy and the dog needs training.", "Your husband has an unhealthy relationship with this dog and it would probably do him some good to get some counseling. If he can't leave the house without his dog by his side (\"to a job interview\"??? Really???) then there's something else going on here. You are his wife and the mother of his children and he is treating his dog better than all of you. Why would he leave her home if he can bring her? Because that's only what people with severe dependency issues do. I could technically bring my 2-year-old with me where ever I go but I don't because 1. some places are inappropriate for a 2yo to be in tow, 2. not everyone will appreciate having a toddler present in many situations, and 3. not being able to be away from her EVER will give her dependency issues as well. \n\nSit your husband down and calmly tell him why this is becoming an issue. Don't make personal attacks or pick on insignificant things like him burping her. Talk about the real problems his dependency on this dog are causing you and then suggest going to counseling (either by himself or together). NTA", "NTA but what country do you live? Here in america only service animals are allowed in most stores and if he lies about it thats a hefty fine at best. Either way sounds like he gave the poor thing separation anxiety from never being away from her and thats not healthy. Also sounds like he's caring more about her than you which is horrible.", "NTA. From what I gathered, you guys have a child together, with one on the way, and he prioritizes the dog before them? This is not going to get better when the baby comes, its going to get way worse.", "NTA  I feel bad for you and the baby that's coming. Your husband need professional help and to check his priorities. \nIt's not just irrespectful not to consider your opinion but also makes you wonder how he will behave having a baby around. \n\nI would put boundaries, stat in a clear and respectful way how you feel and stop going out if he brings the dog (unless a park), if it doesn't work I would put an ultimatum, therapy or out. \nGood luck, and stay firm in your position. The dog is not winning in this situation either.", "NTA - Your husband's behavior is obnoxious. I say this as a dog lover and former shelter volunteer.

What do you mean bring a dog to a job interview???", "NTA\n\nI am a dog person, I love my dog like he is my son. My dog however does not go everywhere with me, has rules and boundaries, and is a well-adjusted dog. My parents treat their dogs like literal terrible grandchildren. They never are told no, they get everything they want, and they are never away from my parents. Which in turn means that when they bring them to our houses to visit they are the bane of my existence. They steal food, and I mean like flying through the air steal it from your hand as you're holding it above your head trying to keep it away from them, they bowl over my little nieces and nephews to steal their food, you can't have a cup of coffee with them in the house because they will do everything in their power to stick their face in your coffee cup, my dad thinks it's cute that they like to drink coffee with him \ud83d\ude44. We've told my parents how they turn their dogs into terrible terrible people, my problem isn't with them treating the dog like people my problem is that even if they had a toddler and treated it like this that toddler would grow up to be a narcissistic serial killer.", "NTA but do you really want to take care of a newborn under these circumstances? He will 100 \n% prioritise the dog, not the baby. You'll get zero help. He'll miss the birth because he can't bring the dog to the labour ward.

If you need an emotional support dog to go to the bar, should you be going in the first place? Adding alcohol to his emotional distress? Absolute disaster! \n\nA dog should *never* replace a human relationship. He needs to step up and go to therapy, and that dog needs serious training and meds. You already have a child, with another on the way. Your husband and dog sound like two more children to take care of. That is ridiculous. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this OP.

Your husband definitely needs therapy if he took the dog to job interviews\u2026but the dog is probably functioning as an emotional support animal for him at this point. You don\u2019t just \u201cleave it behind\u201d if the dog is keeping you from having panic attacks. It sounds like your husband has gotten to that point.\nIt also sounds like the dog has anxiety and probably could use training and/or medication.\nYour entire post is whining about how he puts the dog first (aka, you\u2019re jealous of the dog.) So you are also an AH. \nThere\u2019s clearly a whole side to the story that we aren\u2019t hearing here - it\u2019s too bad we can\u2019t hear what your husband has to say.", "Uhhh after reading your comments, ESH.\n\nIt sounds like you resent him for a lot of reasons (the failing business and inability to find a decent job, refusal to get therapy, etc) and the dog is just the ultimate symbol of it. If he won't get therapy then he will not get better and you're playing a losing game.\n\nHowever, you're also an asshole for admitting this dog BITES PEOPLE and still allowing it in your home with your children. You got a baby on the way dude. This is dangerous.\n\nHe ruined this dog and will not get rid of it, so honestly, get rid of him. Sounds like he's contributing nothing to the family anyway.", "NTA. He's awful. How is he going to behave when there's a baby in need of attention?", "NTA\n\nIt's annoying that people are like this when they have a significant other that doesn't agree. Its also annoying that people create dogs that are so co-dependent that the owner being out of the room gives them anxiety. What's your husband going to do when new baby comes? It's wild to me that he brought the dog home without discussing it with you. Not Ok!", "Yup, my thoughts exactly. He's started only applying to jobs that are outdoors and allow dogs to go. As you can imagine, this limits job opportunities. Granted right now he owns his own business but it is very quickly going in to the red and he's more than likely going to lose it soon. So him being this picky over a job is truly not something we can afford.", "He refuses therapy (he needs therapy in the worst of ways due to multiple issues). He says it's a waste of time and he's not going to talk to a stranger about his problems. Instead, he's trying to register his dog as an emotional support animal thinking it will solve all his problems.", "Based on the edit, that was the time for OP to split, when he got the dog despite their agreement on timing. She got pregnant with this guy instead. Which doesn't sound like the best judgement ever.", "To add on - this needs to end immediately if there is a baby on the way. As a dog professional(currently pregnant myself), I just can\u2019t fathom this. It\u2019s abusive to the dog. And you.", "I've tried, unfortunately. I've raised the point of therapy several times because he definitely needs it (for other things) and he refuses. Says it's a waste. I had finally convinced him to re-home the dog last year (she started biting people) and 2 days later he was saying he was registering her as emotional support. She did stop biting however. Not sure what that was all about. He doesn't think he has a problem. He doesn't think the dogs anxiety is bad either.", "We are in America. Most places where we live don't even ask about the dog when he brings her inside. I mean, he even goes to Lowes or Home Depot specifically for no other reason other than to bring his dog.", "He won't apply for any job at all unless it's outdoors and he's already cleared with them that he can bring his dog. He currently owns his own business buts it's going belly up due to lack of demand so him being this picky over jobs isn't something we can afford.", "Why do you let your parents bring your dog to your house, then? It's *your* house.", "I don't see the dog going to the bar as a problem; there's a bar near me w pawtio and dog menu.", "I don't resent him for his failing business (mine failed last year). I said that to another commenter providing info and not once did I say I resented him. I simply said we can't afford for him to be as picky as he is. I do resent him for not getting therapy because he makes it my problem by refusing to deal with his problems. Him having an emotional outburst because a cup fell out of the cupboard when he was trying to grab a plate and following it up with saying \"why does this always happen? Why does life like fucking me?\" Is 100% an issue and he does need help.", "I had a coworker bringing her dog to the office once. I like dogs, but I don\u2019t need that distraction at work. I asked her not to do that again, and she complied. He needs to normalise his relationship with the dog, love can be shown in different ways. I understand you for speaking out, but NAH (yet).", "Then you need to register yourself out of this relationship.\n\nHe needs to get therapy, either do the work to get more business or get a job that isn't outside with the dog or you need to move along and let him and snookums be a couple", "I'm always surprised at the people in shitty relationships who then have one or more kids before realizing how awful it is", "If this dog has the potential to be aggressive, what's to stop her from starting to bite again? From biting you, your kid, or the baby? Are you really prepared to live the rest of your life this way and subject your kids to it too? \n\nHe has a choice, the dog or his family. If he's prioritizing this dog and refusing to seek help, I don't see this ending well. Your marriage sounds like it's on the line and he doesn't care. Are you prepared to give him an ultimatum?", "He is literally revolving his entire life around a dog, I think you should have some serious talk about the situation... At the very least, he should respect that you don't feel the same way about the dog and make some compromises...", "I've already given the ultimatum. Me or the dog. I felt I had no choice to be quite honest because after he pulled the whole \"I need her as an emotional support pet\" after she started biting people, I lost all respect for him. He's completely turned me off the idea of ever having a dog in my home again and he knows that as well. I don't even blame the dog. It's 100% his doing. This could have been avoided but he ruined her, to put it bluntly. But again, I did give the ultimatum a couple weeks ago. Sure, she stopped biting for now, but I'm all set. Right now he has been taking her literally everywhere and snuggling her constantly when he's home and he claims it's because he is soaking up his last moments with her. However, I truly don't think he's even searched for another place for her to go.", "Good for you! Since you gave the ultimatum, I think you need to stick to it. Give him a timeline. You have 30 days (or whatever) to rehome this dog or you lose your family. End of discussion. Honestly, I would tack therapy onto that ultimatum but once step at a time, I guess.", ">I did give the ultimatum  \n>  \n>he has been taking her literally everywhere and snuggling her constantly\n\nyeah, he's made his decision. time for you to stick to yours."]}
