You cannot help him if he will not help himself, and the financial issues with his business going in the red could also tie you down depending on how the business is set up.\n\nLastly, he's putting the dog and its needs before you and your needs. If he cannot put you before the dog, can you expect him to put your child before the dog?", "There is no such thing in the US as a registry for emotional support animals. That designation only allows animals to live with you even where pets are prohibited. The only way to get permission for one is through a letter from a professional, usually a mental health therapist.", "I was going to point this out as well, and it may be a way for OP to frame it to her husband, \"with a baby on the way there will be many changes that if done abruptly will be very confusing to Fido. It would be best for her if we start training certain things now, like staying in her crate or staying home alone. You won't be able to bring her to the hospital when baby is born, and that's sure to be traumatizing for the amount of time she'll be left alone. We should work up to that. Additionally, unless we train these things now,m she's likely to lash out at the baby and that would get her put down. \"\n\nBasically, not training her now is saying he's okay with her anxiety and being distraught later. The kindest thing to do would be to train her properly.", "I am a veterinarian who has euthanized a LOT of dogs for biting or mauling children. This needs to be your hill to die on.", "It's totally all her fault that she got pregnant too.. /s", "Is he aware that in the US it is illegal to bring pets into places that have food? Also, untrained dogs have been responsible for many service dogs being washed from their program and their handler is left without their service dog.", "NTA \n\nHe's definitely ruined that dog, poor thing. I hope things work out for you, whatever you decide. \n\nWe take ours out pretty often. Most times they stay in the car with one of us, then it's park time. We also have a dog sitter for them.\n\nWe have taken them to lowes, I took our older chihuahua to lowes when we were remodeling as a puppy. It was cute, we were painting at the time, she was asked if she was helping and treated.\n\nShe \"painted\" her eyebrows white (She's chocolate). Every time we went back for something she had different paint or drywall mud on her from \"helping.\" She's still a paint checker. The younger one bought a washer and barked at the ads (with people) on the poles.", "Spent $25 last week for 5 gallons of gas and he's going for no other reason than a field trip(???) for the dog??? Hell no. That's money down the drain and it costs a fucking lot to have a kid. I would have left his ass once he started pulling that shit.\n\nI hope your pending divorce is smooth sailing?", "Well I was trying to be general, by my house I actually mean my sister's house. I don't own a home and I live in Florida so my parents don't come visit me. They do go see my sister though and it tends to coincide with the exact same times that I am staying with my sister as well. I told my sister to tell them no, my sister is one of those people that lets everybody walk all over her because she loves them. I am trying to shine up that spine, but I've been trying for 30 plus years.", "Yep it happens all the time unfortunately. People will say their animal will miss them too much and don\u2019t do well in a kennel, when in reality their animal is too sick to care and is pretty much going to sleep the whole time once we make them comfortable. I\u2019ll literally tell their owners their pet can die if they take them home and they say well at least they\u2019ll die with me in their comfort of their own home and not with strangers. People really suck sometimes and unfortunately it\u2019s the animals that suffer for it", " I just can\u2019t fathom this.", "I'm guessing it's genuine, unconditional affection.  OP sounds like a bit of a cold fish.  And an angry one at that!  On the other hand, just from the clues that OP is \"tolerating\" the family pet, oh...I mean \"his animal\".....I'm guessing that it isn't just the fact that they guy takes it everywhere, it's that there's a pet in the first place.  I'd even be up for suggesting that the guy takes it everywhere \\*because\\* he knows how much OP dislikes it and he doesn't want to leave them alone together.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, if my wife acted like this i'd be telling her to get lost.", "I worked at a dog-friendly office, and it sucked. It was fine when people were bringing their dogs in for a few hours before a vet appointment, but it evolved into people getting dogs because they could come to work. It was distracting and unprofessional at the best of times.", "Yea cos it was only her decision \ud83d\ude44", "Gtfo with this nonsense", "why would you assume that?  They already have children, so why would this one be any different?", "No flights anymore - just housing. There\u2019s also no actual registry, so if OP\u2019s husband wants the dog to be an ESA, he\u2019s going to *have* to go to therapy to get it prescribed.", "I feel so bad for children in such situations because they\u2019re the only ones without any say.", "Did you hurt yourself when you jumped to all those conclusions?", "If your wife acted this obsessive over a dog while you were pregnant?", "I got so tired of the dog friendly shenanigans at my workplace that I put a Guinea pig cage in my cubicle. Taught the little guy to make his squeaks if I snapped my fingers and it drove the dogs nuts. It wasn\u2019t long before no animals were allowed, thank goodness.\n\nWork for a zoo or a shelter if you need to be with animals all day. Offices aren\u2019t appropriate spaces for animals.", "I love dogs but can imagine that what you described would be a nightmare and I\u2019d resent that setup.", "It is if abortion is allowed.", "It was a decision she chose to make though, unless he forced her in which case there\u2019s a separate issue altogether. We know that he\u2019s irrational and that he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with his behaviour, but she does and seems to be more reasonable.", "There are some websites where you can just pay to get the letter and dodge taking accountability for any issues you'd be addressing in therapy. I hate those websites with a passion.", "If you don\u2019t respect your partner, according to statistics this relationsjip is doomed", "And they'd likely say to separate, not realizing the parents next relationship will be the same", "Take out the pregnancy piece.  If my wife was this obsessive over a dog i'd tell her to get lost.", "> Taught the little guy to make his squeaks if I snapped my fingers\n\nMy mom's guinea pig was so smart that it only took her a day to learn to squeak whenever you crinkled plastic wrap or opened a refrigerator \ud83d\ude0e", "Are you freaking kidding me?", "It does take more than one person to make a baby. There were two adults that could have used protection but didn't. So blaming her only is ridiculous. And unless you know what goes through someone's mind who has to make a choice like that, then you can sit back down.", "Those websites are scams and do not offer any protection, per HUD\u2019s FHA guidelines. Landlords have largely cottoned on and are starting to check to verify legit treatment providers; some states now have legislation that says you have to be a current patient of the prescribing provider.", "Alright, fair. Just double-checking that you weren\u2019t actually taking her husband\u2019s side!", "I'll sit down when you take some reading comprehension classes. Blaming him won't change the fact that she chose to have a baby with him knowing how mentally ill he is. He doesn't see anything wrong with his behaviour, but she does, so she should have known the issues that would come with bringing a baby in the relationship - something that she could have put her foot down on as the more rational person in this relationship and as the person actually carrying the baby. She's coming on a public forum airing her business out, she can handle a few questions. She does not need you to play a discount hero for her.", "It's always \"why are you reproducing with him?!\" Welp, the baby's already there so why tf is it anyone's business? People act like women are supposed to be psychic."]}
