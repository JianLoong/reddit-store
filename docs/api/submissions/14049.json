He brings her to job interviews, dump runs, laundry runs, grocery runs and has even brought her with us to the bar several times on our date nights. On the rare chance that he doesn't bring her, he is saying things like \"I wonder if she's thinking about me\" the whole time. Our relationship has been bulldozed by constantly having her with us.
