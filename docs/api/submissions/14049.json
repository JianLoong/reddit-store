He brings her to job interviews, dump runs, laundry runs, grocery runs and has even brought her with us to the bar several times on our date nights. On the rare chance that he doesn't bring her, he is saying things like \"I wonder if she's thinking about me\" the whole time. Our relationship has been bulldozed by constantly having her with us.

Any chance I have ever had to interact with a dog, I\u2019ve taken it. I love my own dog more than pretty much any humans I know, and would do almost anything for it. I love taking him with me whenever possible, to places where it\u2019s acceptable: parks, outdoor meetings, houses of friends who allow dogs, places of business that allow non-service animal pets. But that\u2019s it. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine bringing him - who\u2019s ridiculously well-mannered - to a *grocery store* - ones in my area don\u2019t allow that, only actual service animals - or date nights (unless it was something like a picnic or movie in a park. \n\nIf this started after you\u2019d gotten pregnant, I\u2019d guess it might be related to fears about impending fatherhood, or lack of intimacy, or something, but no, he\u2019s just a jerk. \n\nYou need to put your foot down, in some way, because his love for and dependence upon, the dog, in degree anyway, is not healthy, and is obviously bad for your marriage.", "Does he prioritize the dog over his kid?! Cuz if he does your an idiot to even think about having another kid with him", "On the flip side, how sick of you must he be?", "NTA your husband has a huge problem if he is bringing the dog on job interviews. Needs to see a doctor sort of problem, and retrain the dog.", "NTA What he needs is serious help like now. As much as I love animals what he's doing is essentially abuse to all parties involved. Ik you said in a comment that he's trying to register the dog as an ESA as well as refusing to see a therapist. I did a quick check and found that he will need to see a licensed therapist if he wants the dog to be an ESA. I would strongly suggest that you give him an ultimatum of either couple's counseling or you're gone.", "In case you need to hear this.  This is very weird.  AND a forewarning dogs can live alot of years but not forever. Im not sure if your husband will be able to handle it.  You should have a plan in place because I wouldnt be surprised if it broke him.  Losing an animal is like losing a family member. But your spouse is freakish attached to the animal and something could be wrong and if something happened to the dog he could just break mentally.", "NTA- I would be definitely be concerned about something happening like the dog getting jealous of the baby when the baby is born and he puts more focus onto him/her. That and be equally concerned with whether he'll put all of his focus on your guy's baby or the dog too.", "I have an absolute whinging grizzleguts of a dog. I focused so hard on her not demand barking that I didn't even hear it when she was a puppy and now she's over 2 and there are days where it makes me incandescent with rage. Those are the days that I'm more stressed to begin with so obviously she whinges harder because she's feeding on my anxious energy. \n\nIt can be really hard, even when you really love your high strung dog. The days where you have no patience for it can be excruciating, and it's OK to need a break. It's not unfair to want a break from your dog, especially when your partner is encouraging unhealthy behaviours. \n\nNTA", "He might be over scared about the upcoming baby. He might be projecting his fears on the dog especially if it\u2019s getting worse the closer it gets. He needs to talk to someone before he possibly snaps.", "I'm honestly disturbed by your husband's behaviour. \n\nReading about his behaviour made my skin crawl.", "The heck? Yeah I'd go crazy with all the whining too, i already can't stand People who let their dog bark outside all day. My dog has a bit of anxiety when i leave but that's probably cause i don't leave often and i have massive anxiety. But i can't imagine bringing her to everything like that cause she's just too wiggly", "Oh wow, FOUR Springer spaniels?! My friend/past roommate had one and he was absolutely unstoppable. Sweet fella but he was a major handful. I can\u2019t imagine having four that are undisciplined to boot!", "What?  A dog with anxiety issues is his emotional support animal?  How ludicrous!", "It is not legal to ask a disabled person what their disability is and it is not legal to ask what service their dog provides because of HIPPA. There is no licensing entity for service dogs. You can buy a vest that says Service Dog from many sources. So whether you are disabled or not if you take your dog in a store they cannot do a damn thing about it. \nI know this because I pointed out a baby stroller with 5 small dogs wearing pink tutus to the produce manager at my local store. I simply said those cannot possibly be service dogs. He agreed and gave me the explanation and said there is NOTHING they can do about it.", "They already have a child, whom OP sent off to school while he snuggled in bed with the dog. Somehow I get the feeling the dog gets more attention from him already.", "From the ADA website: \n\n>> Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. \n\nSo businesses can totally ask what task the dog has been trained to do.\n\nNow that being said, I guess if someone is going so far as to purchase a fake service dog vest, they\u2019ll probably lie, and businesses can\u2019t ask for any proof or documentation. However if the animal is misbehaving, and causing a safety or health hazard (having accidents, lunging at customers), they can totally be asked to leave.  The business might have to find an alternative accommodation for the individual (online pickup, takeout, etc).\n\n5 dogs in tutus in a baby stroller are at least contained.", "If not worse...", "Grocery stores are not supposed to allow pets but at the one I work at even corporate people don\u2019t do anything about it. They\u2019re like if we made a fuss and ask they\u2019ll just tell us it\u2019s a service animal and then we\u2019ll be the bad guy and the dog is behaving so whatever.", "  Big Box Warehouse Club employee\n here.\n\n  It is against policy to let any\n non-service dogs into the store, BUT...\n  People are so entitled that they throw\n temper tantrums and threaten lawsuits\n for not letting their precious babies into\n the club.\n\n   Corporate has instructed us (Nationwide) to turn a\n blind eye to all animals because we\n may mistakenly question a genuine\n service animal's presence in our store.\n  Asking if a dog is a service animal\n could lead to a massive lawsuit and terrible media coverage.\n  \n  We have cleaned up numerous \"gifts\"\n throughout the building.  \n  We have had two dogs attack each\n other in the laundry detergent aisle.\n   We have had a canine rampage\n throughout the meat department.\n\n  Every time I come in contact with a dog  in my club, I turn around and walk the other way.", "Yup, stores are too scared so shitty people can cart their dogs around as they please. \n\nHowever, do take note that any dog that is acting unprofessional can be asked to leave and you are in complete compliance with the law. Service dogs act like dogs and sometimes that means a bark here or there (some also bark to help their owners) but generally any agressive, loud, or dangerous activities by the dog means you can kick them out. I get you probably don't want to do anything because you might get thrown under the bus but if anything really crazy happens you are legally allowed to kick them out. \n\nAlso please know that legally you can ask two questions, is it a service dog and what tasks do they preform. They keep me calm is not a task, but alerting to anxiety, crowd control and other specific trained actions that can reduce anxiety are tasks that makes them a service dog. There are also many other task that they can preform and actual service dog handlers can usually easily list them. Pet owners rarely have a good answer for what tasks they do so It can help weed out crappy people. There is a caveat that some states allow sd in training the same rights as a full sd so they might say they are not currently tasking buy they are in training for it so they should be able to supply some tasks that they are being trained for.\n\nIf you want more info r/servicedogs has good info and they get questions about this stuff often."]}
