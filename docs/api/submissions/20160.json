Our stops are within 5 minutes of each other and it takes about an hour to get from A to B. \n\nBefore we set off I decided to grab a hot meatball sandwich for the ride, since I was very hungry at this point, it was about 7pm and I hadn't eaten since 11am.\n\nSo we jump on the bus, my friend goes first and chooses to sit at the front, near the seats that are reserved for people with disabilities or mobility issues. There's a lady sat in one of these seats with her leg in a cast and a pair of crutches. \n\nAnyway, we get settled and I unwrap my sandwich to eat, when the lady with the crutches grabs my attention. She explained that she's vegan and on medication that makes her nauseous, and the smell of meat is making her feel like vomiting. She was very polite and apologetic, and asked if I'd mind wrapping my sandwich up until she got off the bus, which was about the same stop as me, an hour away.\n\nMy mouth was already watering at this point and I didn't want it to go cold, so I said I'd just move to the back near the window to eat it instead. I asked my friend if she was coming and she said no because her feet are tired. I move and enjoy my sandwich, and by the time I've finished the bus has started to fill up and the seat next to my friend had been taken, so I just stayed where I was. \n\nShe started sending me angry texts while we were still on the bus, that now she was bored and stuck sitting next to a stranger. This is the same bus she takes home every day and most of the time we don't catch it together, so this really isn't anything unusual.\n\nShe said she was expecting to have me to talk to for the whole journey and that I'd ruined it now. She also accused me of abandoning her  to \"give in to the demands of an entitled brat\" and that I shouldn't put a stranger over a friend. There was a long rant about what kind of friend I am, and how she isn't sure she wants to spend time with me anymore. I pointed out that she could easily moved with me and she just got angrier. \n\nI thought she'd get over it, but it's been three days, she's still mad at me and demanding I admit I was out of line and apologize.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1687273148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14edf5k/aita_for_abandoning_my_friend_on_the_bus/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your 'friend' is the one behaving like an entitled brat.", "NTA\n\n>My mouth was already watering at this point and I didn't want it to go cold,\n\nLove that :)\n\nThis is a case of someone causing their own problems and then blaming them on someone else. \n\n>\"give in to the demands of an entitled brat\"\n\nOMG. The woman politely asked you to cover your food as she was feeling nauseous. And you politely said no and instead moved away. You angel. Your friend was too lazy to walk 10 feet. I cannot.", "You are a kind person moving away from a stranger so the smell of your meatballs doesn't make her nauseous on a long journey. Your \"friend\" could have moved with you, but decided to stay put because of hurt feet. It's not like the bus is a mile long to change seats. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  It sounds like your friend might have some displaced anger. May want to ask if this situation is really what she is upset about. \n\nIf it is, may want to distance yourself because a) you were just trying to be kind while hungry and b) dealing with someone who gets that upset over nothing is exhausting", "NTA - I can see how she might be a little upset if she was expecting you to quickly eat your sandwich and come back but her reaction was so disproportionate, she's out of line", "NTA at all and I\u2019m begging you to not apologize to your friend in the slightest. She seems incredibly immature and honestly the irony of her calling anyone an entitled brat is not lost", "NTA - your friend chose not to move to the back of the bus and then started being weird.", "NTA. Yikes, what a \"friend.\" How can she get upset at you for moving when she declined the opportunity to move with you? If talking to you for the duration of the ride was really important to her, you'd think she would take steps to ensure that happened instead of relying on you to do it for her. Do not apologize for something you did just because she didn't like it. I hope she comes to her senses soon.", "This is not what friendship means i hope.you find Real friends", "NTA she should've moved with you. She could have easily gotten up and walked a couple of steps", "Definitely NTA, but your friend is.  The world could use more people like you who are considerate and kind to others and fewer of those who think it is all about them and what they want.  You did the right thing.  \n\nYour friend made her choice to stay put where she probably shouldn't have sat anyway.  Her behavior is so immature and inappropriate that I really can't think of any more I want to say.  She owes you an apology and I hope you get it if you are hoping to continue this relationship.", "NTA - but you are right, this is an extreme reaction. Try to find out if there is something else triggering her if you want to retain your friendship.", "NTA - what... you didn't ditch her it was her choice not to move with you, and since you are both familiar with the bus and route, she should have known how crowded it was going to get, thus you moving back would not have been an option. It sounds like she's taking all this personal, and to me, that's just weird.\n\nI do find it comical that she's calling the woman on crutches an \"entitled brat\" when she's acting just like one.", "NTA for leaving your friend alone and your friend definitely overreacted, buuut kinda TA for eating on the bus. Come on.

Your friend should have moved seats with you if she wanted to sit with you, regardless of her \u201ctired feet.\u201d It\u2019s not like the disabled lady could change her seat! You were very thoughtful and considerate. You should be proud of yourself.", "Definitely NTA. But Holy shit you friend is a major one though, her reaction was over the top. You just moved farther in the bus, you didn't leave her to fend for herself in a strange city. If she had really wanted to talk to you she would have gone with you, her feet being tired being the stupidest reason for not sitting in the back. It's not as if she would have to walk an hour or anything. Seems to me like you really don't need that kind of toxic energy in your life.", "NTA! Good that you can get rid of such an entitled person that easily...", "NTA, everything you do is very reasonable. Your friends anger came from nowhere. Everyone has their phone to entertain themselves. She should use that for that reason instead of sending you internet stagers.", "NTA.  It was nice of you to move for the lady, & your friend could have moved with you.  She chose to stay in that seat.  Seeing the bus getting more crowded, she still chose that seat.  You didn't leave her or abandon her, you moved to a different seat.  Her getting this upset over such a small thing when all she had to do was move with you is completely obsurd.  You owe her nothing.  Don't apologize when you've done nothing wrong.  She now owes you an apology for being such an AH over this. \n\nI just saw you said she doesn't like vegans.  It sounds to me like she wanted you to eat that sandwich in her face & bc you didn't now she's pissed.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShes an adult get over yourself. 1. she was in the disability portion that even on my worst day i try not to sit in. 2. your feet hurt too much to limp to the back and sit with you??? she did that to herself. 3. congrats on being free from a dumb person, no longer needed as a \"friend\"", "NTA. It was extremely courteous of you to move for the woman with crutches/illness. How tired could your friend\u2019s feet be that they can\u2019t walk several feet to the other area of the bus where you could sit together. How is she going to get from the bus to her home once you reach the stop\u2014teleporting?", "NTA", "ESH; your friend could have just followed you but tbh don't eat on the bus & especially not something messy", "ESH. Here's my reasoning:\n\nYou: I feel like it's generally common courtesy to not eat on a bus, especially something messy like that. The whole situation could've easily been avoided if you ate earlier or grabbed a snack or something while you were having coffee. You obviously had the time. It was kinda an AH move to leave your friend alone on a bus and force her to sit next to a stranger.\n\nThe friend: I get not wanting to get up after a long day of working (especially in heels, oof), but she can't really be mad at you if she didn't want to move to sit next to you. She should bring a change of shoes with her so she doesn't have to continue wearing them. Her going off on you, though, really wasn't called for. \n\nThe lady in crutches: You heard me right, folks, I think this one is an AH, too. The sandwich was already on the bus, I don't think wrapping it up would dilute the smell in any way, shape, or form, especially from a hot meatball sub. It would've been easier for the source of the smell to be eaten quickly so that it would dissipate rather than have it linger through the wrapper. I also don't believe \"being vegan\" is a valid excuse to disturb other people's lives, although she does get a pass on the nausea due to medication.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
