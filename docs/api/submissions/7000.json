I forgot to include this information. The house has a separate section in the property where me and my children lives. The kids don't know that their grandmother is acting this way, only that they are only allowed to visit the main house from time to time because their grandfather needs his rest.

Listen, OP, I did what you\u2019ve done and went in as a meat shield for other people in my family. I was dealing with obligations to visit my grandparents while they really went hard on abusing my mother and my cousin, and her father. It was constant. I realised that if I went every time and my mother stayed home, I\u2019d get her usual abuse and I could grey rock it. Until I couldn\u2019t anymore. And then I lost my mind a little and just cut my grandparents off. I was sick of hearing nasty shit about my own mother, their own daughter. I was sick of them picking on my cousin and her dad, and trying to put myself in the middle so I got the hits. \n\nAnd no human being can take that for long. It\u2019s been roughly 4 years, my grandfather has since passed away, and my grandmother is arguably worse than she ever has been. She still picks on people I love, but I don\u2019t hear of it often. When I do, I inform the person involved and then leave it to them with the correct info armed. I listen to my mother talk about how she\u2019s hurting, and give her advice, the best I can. But I can\u2019t fight those battles anymore. It got too much and if you want to avoid no contact (I think your situation is complicated and I would personally cut contact but understand why you might not want to) then you need to get out of there. You would not be an asshole if you save yourself. You have your whole life ahead of you, you have children to be there for, at your best. Not at your most exhausted, mentally and physically and emotionally. If you cannot do it for you, do it for your kids. \n\nDuring my childhood my grandmother was my favourite person because she was so overly sweet and caring towards me. But over the years I heard and saw how they treated my mother, or how she was after being around them, and figured it out. Kids aren\u2019t stupid, they watch and listen just as much as anyone and they don\u2019t have the mental capacity to always work out WHY something is happening. They know it is, but don\u2019t always get why. All they know is mom isn\u2019t happy, mom looks tired and sad. You deserve a better life than this, you deserve a good life for you and your kids. You all deserve happiness.", "Put yourself first. Nobody else is. #NTA", "Therapy only benefits people who want to change. I don\u2019t think her mom does.

And no, they won't believe her. My kids are pretty level-headed in many ways, being that we only had each other. There was one instance where my Mom shouted at me within their hearing range and they have since only been polite towards their grandmother but not close.\n\nThe environment I grew up in, somehow made me into a decent parent (surprisingly). I had a perfect example of what kind of parent I don't want to be. My children and I are a close-knit group.\n\nThe one in therapy is me. I sent my Mom to a mental facility before (but Dad took her out after six months). We really thought she has schizophrenia because she keeps telling people she sees CCTV on the walls that we installed to spy on her. But the doctors can only see her to be paranoid and has anger management issues. The CCTV were all made up to turn the family sentiment towards her.\n\nYes, I sincerely believe she will not change. I am completely over that hope after it got dashed a million times over."]}
