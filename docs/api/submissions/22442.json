It\u2019s also unfair of him to say that he was seeing how your behavior would be like during marriage when you\u2019re god damn 4 months in. Fuck that", "NTA. Especially since you've only been dating for 4 months when he lost his job and 7 when he got a job? Do I see his point of view on being asked how he's doing, yes. He's your boyfriend he wants you to care about him and there isn't anything wrong with that. Hopefully he's not looking for you to support both of you financially, but honestly you need to ask him if that is what he is looking for. I would say something like \"Hey, I have a concern that you're just with me to support you financially and if that's the case this isn't going to work out, if that's how you feel I need to know.\" Asking it open ended makes him give more than a lying no if it truly is the case. Idk if that's the best way to say it but he definitely needs to know living in the US (assuming that's where you're from) isn't easy and just like everywhere pay isn't increasing as much as rent, and goods are. If he's wanting that move on and let him find out how hard it is to find anyone willing to do that these days. If you think he's a good guy and there is something there have the conversation. It's clear you're upset with him and you have a right to be, but you also need to have a grown up conversation with him. If it gets out of line, which it might let him know you're not accusing him of wanting that but him saying what he said made you feel that way.", "NTA.  After FOUR months?  That's still the honeymoon phase.  You have zero obligation whatsoever.

You aren\u2019t a fianc\u00e9 or a wife. This is 100% not your job. His expectations are extremely unreasonable and frankly, at his age, it\u2019s also potentially safe to assume that he has enough saved up to not have to worry financially for a few months, so it\u2019s safe to assume that he would ASK if needs help. No-this is 100% on him. If he needs help, he needs to be a big boy and ask for help, and to be honest, if I was a 4-month GF, I STILL wouldn\u2019t help if he had asked. It\u2019s too early in the relationship, and I\u2019m not a fan of how he ended up out of work in the first place. He clearly DOES have an attitude problem.\n\nIn the meantime, his dad offers help and he turns it down.

It would be one thing if you were in a long term relationship and lived together but that\u2019s not your situation.  I couldn\u2019t imagine thinking someone I\u2019ve only dated for 4months should be helping me out financially.  His attitude reeks of entitlement.

Advisors suggest that you have a year's worth of expenses saved to cover you in case of job loss. How is it your responsibility, as his girlfriend of 4 months to cover him, more than it was his to be prepared? Keep your purse strings tighter.", "NTA. Major red flag that he expected you to support him after only dating for a few months. My guess is he didn\u2019t want to take his father\u2019s help because he is probably in bad financial situations often and doesn\u2019t want his family knowing.", "NTA. If you were in a long term relationship where you saw a real future then maybe you could be expected to let him move in. Maybe cover groceries while he\u2019s looking for a job. But even then it would be really weird to just be giving him money. \n\nAlso, I hate to judge people\u2019s finances without knowing their story, but he should have enough savings to cover a 3 month gap at 35 years old. Probably worth considering whether this person is responsible enough for a long term relationship.", "I would take that as the red flag it is and run! BF of less than a year.

He's willing to take money from his gf of 3 months but not his dad? Feels misogynistic", "Yes you are! If the role were reversed, you would say he's not a man. Why didn't you offered to take him on a dinner date? It's 2023 women want to be independent but to what extent? \n\nSorry he needs to get with a real woman who can pick him up when he's down.

If you questioned him on how he was doing financially while working you'd be labeled as nosy or even a gold digger but since you didn't question his finances after losing his job you are labeled as uncaring.

Unless you\u2019re married or at least living together this is not a girlfriend\u2019s job. 4 months is waaaaay too soon to assume responsibility for his life. Red flag, girl.", "Honestly I think you are right I got back from an international work trip and had time away from him and realised how disgusted the whole situation made me feel. Like because I have a good career I should support him. Mind you I am just his girlfriend of a few months.", "He didn't planned on losing his jobs 4 months into the relationship. You guys disregard the fact that she said he was looking for jobs and getting rejected. It's not like he wasn't trying. \n\nAgain, you're are ignoring her saying  \"after he lost his jobs, she knows they wouldn't be going on date nights.\" \n\nSo he was paying for all the dates...so why couldn't she pick up where he left off?\" She said she has a great career so you could have paid. \n\nIf he wasn't actively looking for work, it wouldn't have been a big red flag.

Whereas another time he got angry I offered to go dutch on a date and didn\u2019t pay the whole thing. He had alot of pride around money so this was so confusing", "That\u2019s fair\u2026 he did mention that he was looking at my behaviour at this stage to see what I would be like in a marriage.

You think that's long enough to be supporting him at all?", "NTA\n\nRespect. You need to respect your partner for it to work long term.

You are not responsible for him. Your bf is trying to gaslight/manipulate you. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Four months into *dating* he expected you to help him out financially? Based on what\u2014his stellar work history and his clear ability to pay you back? Run. He is going to be unreasonable about lots of other stuff, too. He has a warped world view.", "NTA\u2026 I was laid off for a few months and it never crossed my mind to ask my significant other of 11 years for financial assistance.", "NTA You\u2019re his gf not his mother.", "NTA you were only dating for 4 months. I personally wouldn\u2019t even offer to help someone I was dating until we dated for at least a year or more and that\u2019s just for help on smaller bills. For him to expect this to me is a red flag.", "Society loves telling men that they need to be more open with their feelings before tearing into them the moment they show vulnerability that makes them feel uncomfortable. \n\nHis dad offered him money which he refused, which tells me that contrary to popular opinion here he isn't a mooch. He waited until securing a job before raising his grievances, I.e he did it at a time when it would not pressure you into acting.\n\nYou're forming a relationship with each other. People will expect some level of consideration. I get why you wouldn't ask him about how he's doing financially. What you must understand is that this translates into not asking how someone is coping with a major stress in life. It is going to have the same punch as not asking how someone is coping with an illness, loved one dying etc.\n\nIt is more understandable to not ask in your situation as the other examples don't put you in a position where providing money is on the table. With time, he'll probably understand that but the initial feeling will be that you don't really about him.\n\nIf you're still having a hard time understanding. Think about how you would feel if the roles were reversed. You're unemployed and the person you're dating doesn't ask you how you're coping with it all. Would you be left with the impression that they care?", "4 months in I would still be probably splitting the bill 50/50. Finances should not be on the table, yikes.", "NTA. That\u2019s not your responsibility to help him financially, not when you are just dating.", "Those flags are red as Dorothy's ruby slippers.  Click your heels 3 times and run, honey.", "NTA; after 4 months of dating or being together, I don\u2019t believe financial support should expected.  I wouldn\u2019t expect a man to pick up the tab after I lost my job.  Maybe if we had been together for a few years or were living together, but not a few months of dating.  Guessing his manager issues are not manager issues but employee issues.  He is playing the victim. Run don\u2019t walk away from this one", "NTA", "Run! Pretty soon he will expect you to pay for everything while he sits at home playing games and not even cleaning ...NTA. Run!", "Only together for 4mths, NTA. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he actually quit his job to test whether you would volunteer to be his sugar momma.", "NTA: Four months in, and he thinks you owe him financial support? Naaaaah!! Haha, he really needed to get some body else to do it! Like people who have known him his entire life. Oh, yeah... like his father. So much \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9'ing. Run", "NTA. I can see helping him a little bit, but you guys are not married. Its not your responsibility.", "YTA. He was not asking for money. He was disappointed you showed no concern that he was financially able to survive while unemployed.", "He didn\u2019t want money from his father .. but would take it from you? Moocher.. who wants to save face to his own dad and will take from you to do it .. red flag. And 4 months ? We don\u2019t even know each other buddy not my problem", "NTA- this is after a few months of dating and he\u2019s expecting this from you?!! Yikers!!", "NTA for not helping support him financially. If you\u2019d been together for a few years and lived together, it\u2019d be a different story. But you\u2019d only been together for a few months. It\u2019s unreasonable of him to ask you for that, and unreasonable of him to turn down support from his father regardless of how long you\u2019d been together. \n\nI will say y t a however for your comment about not going on dates that cost money. What\u2019s the harm in you paying for a few nice dates to help support him emotionally, and give him a nice distraction from time to time? You still had a job and making income, I don\u2019t see why the dates had to stop because he wasn\u2019t working. Less frequent, sure. But not stopping them all together.", "NTA.\n\n3 or 4 months isn\u2019t that long. I feel like those are the sort of expectations that come when you have been in a relationship longer and are really committed to each other for life and have joined finances - not just when it\u2019s convenient for him.", "NTA- you\u2019re his girlfriend, not his wife.", "NTA. As a girlfriend, you just needed to be supportive; and it seems you were. I don\u2019t think you had to ask how he was doing financially. Him saying this makes me think he wanted the opportunity for him to tell you his woes and have you offer to help; making it your decision as opposed to him asking. That\u2019s presumptuous of anyone in a new relationship and an indicator of what he might feel they are entitled to in the future.\n\nEdit: punctuation", ">it is ridiculous for him to suggest that his girlfriend is a better source of financial aid versus his dad.\n\nThis may be a reach but does anyone else think that he didn't want to borrow from his dad because he didn't want to seem less manly in his father's eyes, someone whose opinion of him he respects. Maybe he wouldn't have minded borrowing from OP because OP's opinion, whether because of her gender or because she's just the girlfriend of the moment to him, he doesn't respect. \n\nLike I said, I may be reaching but it does seem odd.", "Extremely immature, and his saying he got fired for having a \u201cdifficult relationship with his manager\u201d just screams that he has issues with authority and his ego.", "Maybe my dating bar/expectation is too high but I feel someone in their mid-30s should have some savings and be able to deal with being out of work for a few months. Not having savings makes me think he isn't good with money.", "....and after a year of dating he will expect OP to buy him a house and a car,", "No he lost it due to tension with his manager who was not very nice tbh", "I offered to pay for dates he accepted all offers accept once in the cinema because he didn\u2019t like how it looked. I do agree that even friends ask so that I would take on as something I can improve on. However offering money is against what I believe especially since he has family in the same city who can assist him.", "I did pay for dates if you read further on. But honestly if being a real woman is supporting a grown man financially I am a baby girl.", "I never thought of that tbh. I was surprised he refused money from his dad and sister. I thought it was pride originally. But maybe you are right", "That is one of the reasons I am scared !!! Financially is he husband material if he doesn\u2019t have adequate savings.", "I was trying to understand his logic!!!", "Originally he said enquire but as we spoke more he said offer as it would show my commitment to building together. He even said he probably wouldn\u2019t have accepted the offer but I am not convinced about that.", "That is what I said but he said \u201che didn\u2019t say how he was fairing as you know men are sensitive about finances\u201d that I should have just enquired", "The fact that he tends to have friction with people he works with is a cause for concern too", "Thank you for your comments and honesty I think I should have enquired if he was okay. I still stand by my point that I can give or loan money but see how he may have felt. I only suspect he was expecting more", "Sounds like he had that trouble with his manager on purpose because he thought you would offer him financial support. Who the heck would turn down money from their parent but expect their gf(or bf) of a few months to give them money instead.", ">So he was paying for all the dates...so why couldn't she pick up where he left off?\"\n\nWhere did you read that she didn't pay for dates after he was unemployed?  OP said in one of her comment to someone: \"I paid for 1-2 dates when he was employed but when ***he was unemployed I paid for 60% of the dates*** especially if they were more than \u00a330. There were also a time when I wanted to pay for the whole cinema date and he refused as he didn\u2019t not like how it looked so I am confused. Whereas another time he got angry I offered to go dutch on a date and didn\u2019t pay the whole thing. He had alot of pride around money so this was so confusing\".", "Trust your gut!!!! And when people tell you who they are (through actions and words) believe them.", "Trust your instincts. Run Forrest! Ruuunnn!!!", "If men are that sensitive about finances then that only makes a good argument as to why you shouldn't ask someone who you haven't known that long."]}
