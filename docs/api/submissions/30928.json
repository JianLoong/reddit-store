And during that time she had two boys 9 and an infant. I raised the baby pretty much for those two years i lived there. \n\nWhen hurricane Ian came through it destroyed her house so I moved back to my mom\u2019s (I had already finished high school by this point). I ended up moving into my bfs after some dv situations at my moms and I couldn\u2019t live like that anymore.\n\nSo last May my aunt had asked me if I could babysit her two littles (she had a daughter before i moved out). they are now 2 and turning 1. I said no because I didn\u2019t like when i raised her middle child while I myself was still trying to finish high school and now i\u2019m in college. So I found my own work and I have a great schedule.\n\nThis evening when I was leaving work she was asking my questions about my company, \u201chow much do you make\u201d.. and just other things and I answered because i thought she was going to apply with them she\u2019s been trying to go back to work for a while. She ends up trying to get me to come and babysit for her again and telling me she\u2019ll pay me more than I make right now. \n\nI told her no. I don\u2019t like the conflict of interest, I don\u2019t believe in mixing my work life with my home life. I also know she doesn\u2019t have a good financial situation and what were to happen if she wasn\u2019t able to pay me for a week? That\u2019s my profit I\u2019d be loosing out on. \n\nTelling her no pissed her off, and I feel guilty because I\u2019m a people pleaser but i\u2019ve already raised one of her kids before for free and I feel like that\u2019s what would happen again.

Hrm... so this isn't a periodic \"hey can you watch the kids for a few hours on Sunday\" sort of thing,  this would be a regular gig?  monday- Friday Xam to Ypm sort of thing.   And one assumes it wouldn't interfere with college.\n2. Is your work involved with your school at all? i.e. is it an internship or something, or otherwise in the same field as your major?

I mean, it would be one thing if Aunt asked for a periodic favor to watch her kids for a few hours every so often and you flat said no, never never never.  She did put you up for 2 years (to say nothing of going through the shitshow of losing her house to a hurricane.  That must suck, hard).\n\nHowever, it appears this is not the case.\n\nIf you are taking suggestions AND  she is offering a non trivial amount of money over what you make at your current job, AND you don't absolutely HATE watching her kids, then treat it exactly as a job.  Which is to say,\n\nGet something in writing.  Set expectations for how long each day you'll be watching her kids, how much you get paid, and when you will get paid.  IF she needs you longer on a particular day, then its X amount more per hour AND you have a right to say no assuming no emergencies.  like that.  Its not unreasonable, and you are going to school. Thats priority.   If she can't accept these terms, then , well.. that sucks.  AND if she violates any of the terms (i.e. doesn't pay you on time) then you are out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
