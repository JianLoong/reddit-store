He feels like it was fucked up and also absolutely none of his business? Lol", "Definitely gives off major \"I'm so jealous of her\" vibes.", "Yeah my eyebrows went up when I read that. There's one thing to let it accidentally slip, but her friend has already said that they don't want to talk about it, that their fiance knows what they're comfortable sharing and yet despite all this OP deliberately brought it up to the fiance? I think there's a reason the actual joke wasn't shared with us", "Jokes that involve degrading, humiliating, or bringing up another person's pain aren't jokes... They are bullying at best and emotional abuse at worst. You are using someone else's hurt as your social currency. YTA.", "Op, you\u2019re a trash person to shame a child for quite literally being groomed.  Get over you\u2019re self. It is obvious you are the type of person that likes to make other people feel bad to make yourself feel better. Get over your insecurities and stop having trash bag personality. YTA", "YTA. And a jealous one at that. Your friend found someone who treats her well after a traumatic childhood and you want to blow it up.", "YTA.\n\n>(personally, I think this is just her too ashamed to admit she was going to marry a much older dude and is looking for excuses)\n\nPersonally, I think you're a gigantic asshole.\n\n>Before their wedding she called things off and said she never wanted to talk about it because she felt so disgusted and ashamed of that relationship. \n\nPretty reasonable position to take, let's see if her \"friend\" is willing to respect it.\n\n>She's engaged again with a guy a year younger than her which is pretty funny.\n\nWhy is that funny? Oh, right, because she was groomed and molested by an old man once and now she's dating someone her own age. Isn't that funny! But since she said she never wanted to talk about this again I'm sure any \"friend\" of hers wouldn't try to bring it up, right?\n\n>I've asked if he knows about her relationship with her manager and she says he knows what she's comfortable with sharing.\n\nApparently not! What part of \"she never wants to talk about this again\" confused you? Regardless that's a weird thing to ask since it's none of your fucking business, but you were told (more politely than you deserved) that it's none of your fucking business. A normal person would have stopped mentioning it by now.\n\n>I split the beans during a joke I made.\n\n\"I made a joke about the abusive relationship my \"friend\" was in when she was groomed as a child by an adult in a position of authority that she explicitly told me she never wanted to talk about again, in front of her fiance, am I the asshole?\"\n\nOf course you're the fucking asshole. You either despise this girl or are too unimaginably dense to be allowed to have adult human relationships. Either way leave her alone and never bother her again.", "YTA \n\nyou are full of poison. What is wrong with you?\n\nYour 'friend' (you are not her friend, you probably NEVER were her friend) who never had a healthy loving relationship (romantic or non-romantic) felt pressured into a relationship and she was clear she felt awful about it. And then you go and bring it up. Again, what the hell is wrong with you? Do you not have an ounce of empathy/sympathy/love? Are you just jealous she turned her life around and is doing well for herself. You do sound jealous.  \nI hope you figure out a way out of this vileness. I hope this young woman you claim to be a friend of has good friends that will stand by her and lift her up, not try to bring her down.", "Yta,\n\n\n\n>(personally, I think this is just her too ashamed to admit she was going to marry a much older dude and is looking for excuses)\n\nNo, she eas in an abusive relationship with her predatory boss. He snatched up as soon as she was 18, when he was in his late 30's. This isn't her being ashamed of marrying an much older man, this is her not wanting to tall about her experience with being groomed and almost marrying a predator.\n\n>She's engaged again with a guy a year younger than her which is pretty funny. \n\nAlso How is this pretty funny? What's funny thats she's a year older then him?", "YTA. So your friend was groomed by a creepy old man and you think it\u2019s funny and used it to try to nuke her current relationship?  With a friend like you, who needs an enemy?", "Even putting aside the abusive relationship the friend was in and is clearly still suffering the consequences of, OP knowingly spoke of something she didn\u2019t want discussed with her Fiance. No two ways about it OP, YTA.", "I hope Deb realizes what a bad \"friend\" you are and forgets about you. YTA.", "of course YTA, why do you hate your friend so much", "YTA. Judgmental much? Why are you trying to put this girl down? Why are you bringing up an old relationship in which she was taken advantage of and making it a \u201cnot so funny joke\u201d? Are you just that jealous of her? You are absolutely not acting like a friend. I\u2019m going to go with you secretly hate her. Is she prettier then you? Are you attracted to her fianc\u00e9? Did life give you lemons? Idk but you are definitely not being a good friend.", "You mean to say, your friend was proposed to the second she was \u201clegal\u201d by someone twice her age in a position of power over her and you didn\u2019t see that as a fundamental problem for her mental health? I would love to know what the joke is, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s making light of a horrible abusive situation that your friend probably still has fucking nightmares about. YTA", "YTA. You don't have the right to bring up someone's past when they don't want it brought up. You are a horrible friend.", "YTA. Don't use your friend's abusive past in jokes.", "YTA also probably subconsciously trying to sabotage her relationship so she doesn't realize what a shotty friend you are.", "How is it funny that her fiance is a year younger than her?\nU got some personal opinions and making light of someone's personal and private life is already rude, but to make jokes about it? Of you'r friend? \nYTA", "Why did you want to wreck your friend's engagement op? Jealousy? YTA", "Yes, YTA. It's not your history to repeat. Friends like this suck.", "So you made a joke about your friends former abusive relationship, after her fianc\u00e9e told you he *already* knew what Deb was comfortable sharing with him. Meaning that anything he didn\u2019t know, was not something she was ready to share. But you think her abuse was funny and she was lying about how she felt because of course the 18 year old from a home of addicts definitely wanted to marry her nearly 40 year old fast food joint manger?\n\nYou are appalling and a terrible friend. YTA", "YTA- Obviously you don't care about your friends feelings at all, you're a shitty friend. It wasn't YOUR thing to joke or talk about, and it's definitely not funny that she was groomed and in an abusive relationship. Grow up.", "Yes OP YTA! This woman conveyed to you that she did not want to bring up that relationship, she was embarrassed, young and naive, that manager took advantage of her and you joked about it infront of her current fianc\u00e9, you are not a friend, you're a sh!t stirrer, if I was Deb, I'd rip you and new one and send you packing!", "YTA for being such an awful friend to someone who survived grooming abuse directly out of an abusive home and family. \n\nSo glad your friend is pure entertainment for you, that you would go out of your way to try and say something false and cause issues with her and her SO. Talking about you trying to insinuate to the SO that she is in a current and ongoing relationship with the person who was grooming and abusing her. \nThis is truly sickening behavior on your end OP. Learn to be a better friend. Hell, learn to just leave that person alone. They aren't your friend because you can't be bothered to treat them like one.\n\nEdit* people genuinely need to learn what is and isn't their right to share. Op it was not your right to share this information and honestly you kinda outed yourself as a massive gossip. Who knows what else you've said about her to others and who else you said these things to. Vile behavior to do to someone who considered you their friend.", "But you understand, OP thinks this was not an abusive relationship, and since OP is clearly smarter and more aware of his/her friend feelings than her they must be right !", ">I've asked if he knows about her relationship with her manager and she says he knows what she's comfortable with sharing\n\nI agree with the YTA but she did tell him.  OP stated \"I've asked if he knows about her relationship with her manager and she says he knows what she's comfortable with sharing\".\n\nThat's where the conversation should've stopped.\n\nMaybe she was going to share more about it as she gets more comfortable with him ?  But we'll never know now because OP started running her mouth for no reason.  Going into detail about herfriends  abusive relationship was NOT the OP's story to tell.", "Doesn\u2019t match his ultra conservative role models: The wife needs to be (much) younger.", "I want deb to kick her ass", ">She skips over a lot of details when she does finally talk about it, even with her boyfriend.\n\nYeah, I'd skip over the details about being groomed and sexually harassed into the relationship with my abuser too. It's almost as if it was some type of FUCKING TRAUMA!", "I think you are giving OP way to much credit, I don\u2019t think she *risked* potentially sabotaging her friend\u2019s future for a reaction, I believe that was the point. OP clearly despises this poor woman. She was hoping it would cause problems. She sounds like she feeds of it. Fucking emotional vampires.", "If those of us who *can* speak about it don't, we're doing a disservice to ourselves and to those who aren't in that place yet. Thank you for your kind words.", "Yeah, funny how OP left the joke out of the post.", "Knowing their sense of humour, they probably think it's funny", "That was a bit insensitive of you tbh. I can understand where she was coming from and I think it\u2019s not ok to invalidate her own statement by claiming what you \u201cthink\u201d was behind her past engagement. Mind some boundaries. She was 17 and her manager was in a position of power and totally used it. Lucky girl she had the courage to stop it before it was too late. \nYTA", "Clearly OP is one of those people that uses \u201cjokes\u201d as a weapon to hurt people. I know a few people like that and they quickly became non-friends.", "Waiting until she was 18 to date her, so he basically groomed her and she was brave and lucky enough to get out... Yet you talk about it like its a joke, also you sound a bit jealous too. Hope she ditches you soon. Not an ounce of empathy in your post.", "Probably thinks she's so ashamed of being engaged to the older guy that she looked for someone younger", "SA assault victim here. It was by a family meme ER and I pushed it down to the point I questioned if it happened. After I got pregnant with my son memories started surfacing, almost 25 years later. I didn\u2019t tell my husband or anyone my whole life. We\u2019d been married for seven years before i told him. Trauma is complicated.", "NTA.\nShe's getting engaged and doesn't even have the authenticity of telling her future husband the truth.\nHate this generation.", "I was engaged to my severely abusive ex, and I honestly dont remember that I was most of the time as my brain has blocked out large parts of those years for survival. My partner knows I was in an abusive relationship, he knows as much as is relevant for our relationship. Talking about saying yes because I was scared he would beat me or kill me if I didnt is something thats hard to work into convos and not something I'm too hyped to relive unless I absolutely have to."]}
