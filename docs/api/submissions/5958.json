You yourself just said she's ashamed by this one (she shouldn't be - she was groomed, manipulated, and harassed) and now you want to rub salt in that still open wound? What's wrong with you? Are you jealous of her?

I mean your tone and you being an apologist for a 38 year old man grooming an 18 year old is appalling! And you're claiming it's her fault ? After knowing about her situation with home, life and work ? Are you that daft ? \n\nAnd I dont get whats so funny about her whole situation that you managed to crack a joke out of it ? Are you proud of yourself ? Was it even your place to tell her guy about it (you again seem to find that him being younger than her is some kind of sniggering joke) ? \n\nYou cleary meant to hurt her, and you clearly know you're the asshole. Apologize to her and be a better friend (if she even decides to accept your apology). Also you need to educate yourself instead of being a victim blamer !", "YTA\n\nThis is mean girl stuff.", "YTA, also you are not her friend. Friends are shitty like this to one another. I hope she cuts your toxic bullshit out of her life.", "Bro you KNOW you\u2019re the AH. You posted this knowing full-well that you were in the wrong. It was none of your business and she said she never wanted to talk about it. And the fact that you worded this all so matter-of/factly and included that you KNEW she never wanted to talk about it, you KNEW she was embarrassed about it. Deb needs better friends.", "Yeah YTA.  This girl was EIGHTEEN!  She was clearly caught in something way beyond her years and with the hindsight of adulthood is embarrassed by it.", "YTA, and you're a bad friend. Her reasoning is super legit, and I'm surprised you consider yourself her friend while saying she's making excuses. \n\nWith friends like you, who needs enemies? Hopefully this is the end of your friendship so she can move away from more toxic people in her life.", "YTA, it shows even the way you are talking about this woman. How dare you assume what she thinks and redefining her take on that proposal.\n\nAre you jealous of her? You are no friend at all.", "YTA what the fuck? Like seriously what is wrong with you?!", "YTA\n\nCan you please stop referring to yourself as her friend, because you are not her friend.", "Maaaayor YTA. Not even a close call\u2026\n\nOP why would you joke about something you know is embarrasing for your \u201cfriend\u201d? And yes I put the quotation marks on purpose because I really think you cannot call yourself a friend and make horrible jokes about someone\u2019s past and insult them in the process.

Eeesh.", "these are the only two comments I needed, yall said what I came to say.  \"she never wanted to talk about it\" so why in hell would you think it was okay to use as joke fodder?  maybe you didn't know but child abuse and grooming are actually not funny?

I\u2019d hate to see what horrors OP brings on people she admits to disliking.", "It\u2019s a tough call. Many people react negatively when their SO discloses they broke an engagement. People can be so judgmental. Now, if you\u2019re going to marry someone, you\u2019d want to know if they\u2019re going to judge you for something like this. But given her past it\u2019s not entirely shocking that she has trouble opening up. Very sad all around.", "someone can take advantage of your inexperience and groom you at any age.\n\nAnyone can have negative intentions and motives in that kind of age gap dynamic.\n\nBeing 18 doesnt make you any less vulnerable to someone's manipulation.", "She was 18 *and taken advantage of*. How do you describe such a textbook predatory relationship only to be like \u201cehh she\u2019s just making excuses though\u201d. You need to work on your empathy and grow up.

And then learn to be a decent friend.", "You\u2019re creeping up to 30 yo and have the mindset 18 is a grown adult? You\u2019re the type of person and reason people are scared to come forward.

He waited - purposely- until she was - 18. \n\nHe was 20 years older than her AND her boss. \n\nYou think you can\u2019t be groomed because you\u2019re an adult?

YTA", "Ugh, your friend needs to dump you.", "Being 18 doesn\u2019t make you aware to all.", "Just makes it technically legal, doesn't mean not grooming.", "In the pinned post op wrote the joke was:\n\n >  I said why didn't she just use her previous engagement ring and save her boyfriend some cash.\n\nI would say that's pretty bad.", "Giant flag of how thoughtless and hateful OP is...", "Yeah. But lots of people don\u2019t share about their SA and past rape because that shit is traumatic, talking about it can be triggering, and some others actually think of that kind of thing as the same as being willing participants. \n\nListen to this \u201cfriend\u201d - this 17 year old (so a minor) had addict parents who weren\u2019t present for them (so probably also not meeting their basic needs), needed the job to survive, had a boss ask her out and then to marry him when she felt like she couldn\u2019t say no or she\u2019d lose her only means of income (aka the basic survival stuff her parents aren\u2019t providing), had no adults she could go to to help her out of the situation and was too young to know she could go to corporate for her work place and had friends who thought she was actually dating this guy and therefore no help at all. And even though, in that same situation she found the courage to escape that *very clearly sexual predator* all on her own her almost 30 year old friend STILL considers this a consensual relationship that is a joke and worth mocking her about. \n\nI can see why she\u2019d be scared to tell her partner and hope he saw it as the pure predation it was and not the way OP does\u2026 that you\u2019d lose your partner because they think you were a willing participant in your SA and rape would be devastating.", "Because OP isn't her friend.", "\"At least fiance isn't your boss this time and you felt forced to say yes?\" But then jokes are supposed to be funny...  \nYTA OP.

Oh my god, I'm laughing my goddamn ass of at the thought of this. They're the same age, just fucking imagine! Please, someone get help, this is so funny I can barely breath anymore. The only thing funnier than this is a 17 year old with drugged up parents getting groomed by an authority person more than double her age! I'm sitting here full belly laughing at the thought of it. Like, she took the chance to get away from her addict parents only to fall into the hands of a completely fucked up guy in his late 30s going for minors! I'm fucking wheezing.\n\nMan, what's up next OP's sleeve? She gonna burst out laughing at someone's funeral because it's just so funny they died before their parents?

Forever.  She'd be better off without someone in her life who thinks her abusive past is funny. YTA", "If the hurt person can properly cope with their situation and the partner is satisfied enough with the relationship to marry their partner, then it seems like all is fine. Is this some life-saving emergency info (like certain allergies, illnesses, etc.)? Is it somehow altering your future life together in a massive way (debts, having warrants, whatever)? If none of that applies, then I think the person who was hurt should go at their own pace. If that means never telling your partner a certain detail because it is just too painful to discuss, then that should be fine. If you love your partner, that also means respecting their boundaries and the fact you don't somehow have a right to their entire past."]}
