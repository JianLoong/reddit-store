It was for the whole family so there were kids, husbands, everyone to love and dote on my sister and brother-in-law and their baby.

This was in the presence of my husband and I could tell immediately that it hurt him. I was flooded with the feeling that the children we're hoping and praying for will be looked down on.

I wouldn\u2019t blame you for being distraught and having your mood down. This isn\u2019t your fault for feeling this way, cut off that disgusting man.\n\nAnd the fact that he tried to gaslight you and make you feel like you made everyone feel unwelcome after he insulted your husband?", "NTA.  You removed yourself from the situation rather than causing a scene by speaking up or leaving altogether.  That\u2019s a pretty rational decision.", "NTA. First, why is your mother asking prying questions about your potential children at your sister's baby shower? The spotlight is supposed to be on her.\r  \n\r  \nAfter your mother asked a question she never should have asked, your father gratuitously insulted your husband. He did it in public, so you're justified in responding in public. Instead, you chose dignity and not further distracting from the party's purpose and excused yourself from the scene.\r  \n\r  \nYour mother is an AH for expecting you to quietly accept the insult. Your father is worse. It's what *he* said that made things awkward. Both your mom and your dad were the ones who impolitely caused the focus to be taken from your sister and her baby. When you do get to talk in depth to them, tear them a new one for their behavior.", "Your parents are the TA. \n\nIf that is the way they feel you need to create some distance from them for your husband\u2019s sake. \n\nBoth of your parents made incredibly tasteless and crude remarks and you did well to just give yourself space rather than respond. \n\nYour sisters shower wasn\u2019t ruined by your temporary absence.", "NTA. What your parents did was horribly hurtful and completely out of line. I am so sorry that you were treated that way", "NTA  \n\nThe comments became uncalled for and rude, as is blaming you after the fact for removing yourself from the situation.  \n\nFrankly both you and your husband were more polite than I would have been in the same situation.

What an ignorant thing he said! I think you did really well to not cause a big angry scene and ruin the rest of the shower. I\u2019m sorry your dad is so grievously misinformed about how injuries work and that he has such a negative opinion about people who are differently abled. He\u2019s the one that made people feel unwelcome by the way. \nUrg, hopefully your sister understands and isn\u2019t mad at you.

You are really brave for even staying in that house after such a disrespectful comment, and even more coming from your own father. Also props to your husband for keeping the baby shower plan. I dont want to sound rude but your mother and father are such a spawn of hell. How on earth can you make such a comment and then feel entitled to say such things when leaving. While i understand how you feel for not sticking up and defending your husband, now you are prepered for similar comments in the future.", "NTA. But your father is terrible.

Your emotions were justified and you handled them as best you could in that moment. Leaving was better than making a scene or ignoring the hurtful and ridiculous comments. Of course, we all want in hindsight to have used some pithy comment to stand up to a bully and put them in their place without making everyone else miserable. That\u2019s a tall order when you\u2019re shocked and hurt. Moving forward you can think about how to handle that kind of situation and how to address this current one with your parents who are definitely AHs.", "NTA.  Your father had the nerve to insult you and your husband to your faces and in front of the entire family.

The fact that your parents had the audacity to speak to you the way that you did and then fault you for having a perfectly reasonable reaction to it is absolutely disgusting. Sure, you could have put on a happy face and pushed through the rest of the shower, some people would say that's what you should have done, but you had every right to remove yourself from the situation after their behavior.

It makes me wonder if he even remembers why my husband is disabled even though it has been explained to him.", "He's the type who, wants he has something in his mind he will stick to it no matter who tells him otherwise. I think all along he's just convinced himself that something is \"wrong\" with my husband and he doesn't even factor in the TBI.", "I agree, you were obviously hurt by your dad's insensitive and ignorant comment, but your reaction was to make it about _you_ and how _you_ felt. The true victim was your husband, who had to deal with your feelings and your dad's AHery. He married you; it's your family causing the hurt. He literally wouldn't have been told that exact comment at that time if he hadn't married you. You need to protect him in these cases. You need to develop a thicker skin.\n\nPractice in front of a mirror: \"Hahaha, funny one Dad, you know _injuries_ aren't passed on to kids.

I'm 40 years old and currently getting around the house with a walker (wheelchair on bad days) because my breast cancer spread to my bones and tried to eat my spinal cord. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow but we are so fortunate to live in a time with technology available, like your husband's cochlear, that people 100 years ago could only dream of.", "Tell him that you would rather have a disabled child then a fu\\*\\*king AH like him.", "Your dad chose a happy occasion to go out of his way to insult your husband.  This wasn't an accident.", "I would suggest some counseling to help stand up for yourself and your husband if you're not getting it already.

Are you sure they didn\u2019t say anything else extremely rude about your future children to him when you weren\u2019t in the room??
