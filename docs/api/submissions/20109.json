As a guest, you would never be given chores but as a very good friend or significant partner you'd be comfortable and okay doing dishes.

It\u2019s dinner and then continue the romantic evening, worry about dishes later and if he offers to help that\u2019s great.

You even stated yall aren't that serious yet so you surely aren't at the sharing chores stage.", "ESH. You should have offered to help and together you could have gotten them done in 15 minutes. I have often heard that to a woman there is nothing sexier than seeing a man wash the dishes.", "NTA - I\u2019m a woman and I\u2019ve never asked a man I was dating over in the early stages and done this. You\u2019re not a couple yet. Wow.", "ESH. She\u2019s a bigger AH than you though. Sharing chores?? Guest don\u2019t share chores, also you\u2019ve never stayed the night so there\u2019s no chores to share. Asking you help with dishes isn\u2019t a big deal, if it would\u2019ve just being her dish and your dish, while she stayed by your side would\u2019ve been okay. But to have you wash all the dishes and still have the nerve to disappear, definitely rubs the wrong way.", "NTA. I am in full support of couples splitting chores evenly, and the idea that when one person cooks the other will clean is a good idea all around. However, I consider it to be a policy instituted for a more serious relationship. 2 months is too early imo. You guys should still be getting to know each other and having fun \u2014 not figuring out how to spend your lives together. \n\nIt is interesting you refer to her as \u201cyour gf\u201d throughout the post. It\u2019s possible you all are moving a little too fast and seeing each other so frequently that she feels the need to determine whether you\u2019re interested in an equal partnership.\n\nRegardless of her possibly mistaken impression of the seriousness of your relationship, I still think it was rude to leave you there. Bare minimum she should\u2019ve stayed and conversed with you but I really think it should\u2019ve been a joint activity. I\u2019m nearly 3 years in to my relationship with my partner, and on the rare occasions I have him clean by himself, I never abandon him in the kitchen to go watch tv. I always stay so we can talk and it\u2019s not so lonely. All in all, it was rude behavior on her part.", "I'm gonna say NTA and I can't wait for the comments on this one. For not wanting to do the dishes? NTA. I wouldn't have expected to either. Whenever I have offered this same scenario to people I always clean up without asking for help. Unless my hands are in a sink full of water and don't have a towel or paper towel handy at the edge of the sink. \n\nIf I invite someone over and say \"I'm going to cook for you\" that means you sit down and don't do anything cause I've got it all taken care of. If I dont mean that I always say, I can cook if you help clean, before they even show up. So NTA for not wanting/expecting to do dishes but good that you sucked it up and helped.\n\nYTA a little bit though for saying something about it later over the phone. You could have just not said anything and everything would be exactly the same. It's not bad that you asked but maybe you could have brought it up the next time you have dinner.

There\u2019s a difference. I don\u2019t agree with the e s h votes- there was no need for anyone to do the dishes right then. She could have done them later.

As a host I would never expect my guests to cleanup; as a guest I would offer to help. That said, your relationship is a bit different than, say, hosting a coworker for an occasional meal.

She could've accompanied you or chatted with you at least instead of watching tv but you just expect her to cook for both of you and do the cleanup after??

Your reaction was immature.", "NAH \n\nIf you don't cook, you clean. Pretty standard rule. Should she have clarified this? Yes.

I think if someone told me they wanted to cook for me, I would have been surprised if they expected me to clean up, using the fact that they cooked for me as the reasoning I should clean up alone.\n\nThis is how this situation ideally would have gone. She cooks for you as she offered (very kind gesture). And then you, as a thank you, offer to either at minimum help her clean or offer to clean in her place. \n\nBecause of the way I was raised to treat my guests, my instinct is to feel that the gf wasn\u2019t being a great host but I think she just feels comfortable with you as her partner and didn\u2019t really consider you a guest and more so a comfortable presence in the house, like how you probably wouldn\u2019t care to ask a family member to clean up after eating.", "Maybe it could have been good if she asked while she was cooking.

I think household chores often to still fall unfairly on women; the days are gone when most women didn't also have jobs outside the home. So if you're just grabbing a normal dinner together, and she cooks it, you should clean up.

It's been 2 months and she COOKED FOR YOU. You should be offering to help at the very least. The devil's advocate take is that she could've suggested that you clean together instead of leaving you to it alone when you're unfamiliar with where things go...but it's still a wonderful gesture that she cooked for you. It's a very new relationship, so miscommunication and misunderstanding is normal. Use this as a learning experience; talk it out and find a common ground.

If I was two months into dating, made dinner for someone, and they didn\u2019t offer to help clean up? Yeah, no brownie points for them. I would then ask them to do the dishes and might even wander off to make my point. \n\nIf you arrived and thanked her for dinner, asked to set the table, asked to chop the veggies and be her sous chef, I would give you a pass. I am too old to date someone who doesn\u2019t have basic life/relationship skills and manners.

Took me a few relationships to find someone who is a true partner and I could never go back.) \n\nIf it was a first date or I was throwing a dinner party or you were at my place as a guest vs. a date night I would have a different protocol and give the full guest experience.
