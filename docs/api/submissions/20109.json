As a guest, you would never be given chores but as a very good friend or significant partner you'd be comfortable and okay doing dishes.

It\u2019s dinner and then continue the romantic evening, worry about dishes later and if he offers to help that\u2019s great.

You even stated yall aren't that serious yet so you surely aren't at the sharing chores stage.", "ESH. You should have offered to help and together you could have gotten them done in 15 minutes. I have often heard that to a woman there is nothing sexier than seeing a man wash the dishes.", "NTA - I\u2019m a woman and I\u2019ve never asked a man I was dating over in the early stages and done this. You\u2019re not a couple yet. Wow.", "ESH. She\u2019s a bigger AH than you though. Sharing chores?? Guest don\u2019t share chores, also you\u2019ve never stayed the night so there\u2019s no chores to share. Asking you help with dishes isn\u2019t a big deal, if it would\u2019ve just being her dish and your dish, while she stayed by your side would\u2019ve been okay. But to have you wash all the dishes and still have the nerve to disappear, definitely rubs the wrong way.", "NTA. I am in full support of couples splitting chores evenly, and the idea that when one person cooks the other will clean is a good idea all around. However, I consider it to be a policy instituted for a more serious relationship. 2 months is too early imo. You guys should still be getting to know each other and having fun \u2014 not figuring out how to spend your lives together. \n\nIt is interesting you refer to her as \u201cyour gf\u201d throughout the post. It\u2019s possible you all are moving a little too fast and seeing each other so frequently that she feels the need to determine whether you\u2019re interested in an equal partnership.\n\nRegardless of her possibly mistaken impression of the seriousness of your relationship, I still think it was rude to leave you there. Bare minimum she should\u2019ve stayed and conversed with you but I really think it should\u2019ve been a joint activity. I\u2019m nearly 3 years in to my relationship with my partner, and on the rare occasions I have him clean by himself, I never abandon him in the kitchen to go watch tv. I always stay so we can talk and it\u2019s not so lonely. All in all, it was rude behavior on her part.", "I'm gonna say NTA and I can't wait for the comments on this one.

Unless my hands are in a sink full of water and don't have a towel or paper towel handy at the edge of the sink. \n\nIf I invite someone over and say \"I'm going to cook for you\" that means you sit down and don't do anything cause I've got it all taken care of. If I dont mean that I always say, I can cook if you help clean, before they even show up. So NTA for not wanting/expecting to do dishes but good that you sucked it up and helped.\n\nYTA a little bit though for saying something about it later over the phone. You could have just not said anything and everything would be exactly the same. It's not bad that you asked but maybe you could have brought it up the next time you have dinner.

There\u2019s a difference. I don\u2019t agree with the e s h votes- there was no need for anyone to do the dishes right then. She could have done them later.

She could've accompanied you or chatted with you at least instead of watching tv but you just expect her to cook for both of you and do the cleanup after??

Your reaction was immature.", "NAH \n\nIf you don't cook, you clean. Pretty standard rule. Should she have clarified this? Yes.

I think if someone told me they wanted to cook for me, I would have been surprised if they expected me to clean up, using the fact that they cooked for me as the reasoning I should clean up alone.\n\nThis is how this situation ideally would have gone. She cooks for you as she offered (very kind gesture). And then you, as a thank you, offer to either at minimum help her clean or offer to clean in her place. \n\nBecause of the way I was raised to treat my guests, my instinct is to feel that the gf wasn\u2019t being a great host but I think she just feels comfortable with you as her partner and didn\u2019t really consider you a guest and more so a comfortable presence in the house, like how you probably wouldn\u2019t care to ask a family member to clean up after eating.", "Maybe it could have been good if she asked while she was cooking.

I think household chores often to still fall unfairly on women; the days are gone when most women didn't also have jobs outside the home. So if you're just grabbing a normal dinner together, and she cooks it, you should clean up.

The devil's advocate take is that she could've suggested that you clean together instead of leaving you to it alone when you're unfamiliar with where things go...but it's still a wonderful gesture that she cooked for you. It's a very new relationship, so miscommunication and misunderstanding is normal. Use this as a learning experience; talk it out and find a common ground.

If I was two months into dating, made dinner for someone, and they didn\u2019t offer to help clean up? Yeah, no brownie points for them. I would then ask them to do the dishes and might even wander off to make my point. \n\nIf you arrived and thanked her for dinner, asked to set the table, asked to chop the veggies and be her sous chef, I would give you a pass. I am too old to date someone who doesn\u2019t have basic life/relationship skills and manners.

This being said OP should have offer to clean the plates and glasses that they used. Considering he said washing up took around 30+ minutes she left everything dirty after cooking. And like I said before maybe she was tired after cooking, we don't know how long it took to cook and she shouldn't have left him alone to deal with it. They could wash up together or she could have keep him company. And again I say OP was not a guest in that house, they dated for 2 months already and he didn't state this was his first time there.", "Understandable. I wouldn't have make my boyfriend clean after I invited, but not everyone is the same. We also only heard OP's side. The gf could think this is absolutely normal and she maybe doesn't consider him as a guest especially if he was in that house a few times earlier. (He only stated they weren't sleeping at each other's every week, didn't say they had never been at each other's.) \nIt's not unreasonable to ask a boyfriend to clean up or help her do it, since she did cook a \"great\" meal. The problem is that she left him alone there to deal with it and not even provide him company.", "Does it say somewhere he was there before, but not for dinner?", "There's no such thing as too early point to be equals.", "In my family and friend circles anytime you\u2019re invited for a nice meal, it\u2019s cursory to offer to clear the table at the very least. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not normal or expected in relationships. Manners don\u2019t cost anything.", "people give tests now in relationships?? man, I'm glad I'm married.", "They obviously had a difference in comfort levels. She felt very comfortable to the point where she was assigning him chores. He did not feel quite so comfortable and casual. I do think it\u2019s inappropriate to abandon the first time guest to clean your kitchen alone no matter what your future intentions towards them. \n\n\nRemind me never to have dinner at your house. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about your intentions.", "see im kinda the opposite. im not the biggest fan of cooking, ill still do it but its not my favourite task, but i really enjoy washing dishes and cleaning kitchens. *however*, id be really put off if someone asked me to do dishes the very first time i stayed for dinner n then just\u2026 left me alone for 30 minutes. \n\nlike yeah, im very much a \u201cyou cook, i clean\u201d kinda guy, but the least you can do is keep me company yknow?", "This is my mindset as well! If I\u2019m having someone over for a date and there\u2019s washing up, I pretty much always just leave everything to soak and deal with it either when they\u2019re gone or in the morning (with or without them) if they\u2019re going to hang around the next day too. It seems so weird to me to interrupt the date with washing up that can easily be done another time, but if it\u2019s going to be done there and then, I\u2019m not expecting them to do it, even if they\u2019re my partner, as long as it\u2019s *my* house and not *our* house.", "That's you. OP's gf is different and wanted to know what his attitude towards sharing chores is because she's not into being 50's housewife nor anybody's maid.", "Okay next time you go on a first date ask to combine bank accounts and move in with each other", "There are ways to find out what people are like, by setting up certain situations. No different from like visiting parents, seeing how someone treats waiters etc. Places to evaluate their character. Normal things people want to know before entering deeper commitment such as marriage.", "Idk what else he's supposed to call her since we don't know her name. Seems weird to call her \"my date\" But too early for \"girlfriend\"", "It\u2019s rude not to offer in both groups, but the first group might not be allowed to actually help.", "But this isn't every day cooking dinner for a partner and expecting them to help clean up.\n\nThis was inviting him over as a guest/as a date night to cook dinner *for* him.\n\nIf I invited anyone over for dinner it's polite of them to offer to help tidy up, but I wouldn't accept it and I'd just leave the dishes until later/next morning even so I could spend time with my guest/date.\n\nThat's not being subserviant - that's being a host.", "That wasn\u2019t \u201csharing chores.\u201d If they were sharing chores, she would have said something like \u201cwould you mind helping me tidy up?\u201d She was the typical \u201850s husband - leaving the SO to clean up while lounging in front of the television, perhaps occasionally rattling their glass to let that special someone in the kitchen know that they needed their drink refilled. \n\nWhen you INVITE someone to dinner, they are your GUEST, no matter how close a friend or family member they are. You should not expect your guest to clean, although if they offer you can choose how much or little you would like for them to do.", "I think it\u2019s an odd ask from her because OP might be totally okay with task sharing in a long-term commuted relationship but she dumped it on him after a first dinner invite with no prior discussion.  She could have tested the waters instead by saying that she was inviting him over and would cook, but would maybe he mind washing up.", "That is not what equality is. Combined bank accounts is literally the opposite. Equality does not mean lack of independence.", "\"A woman I'm dating\"", "Beautifully stated!! I agree completely!", "Huh fair enough but it still seems weird to say \"AITA for not washing dishes after the woman I'm dating cooked us dinner\". Maybe it's just me tho."]}
