And while I love the hair dryer, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s any different than something I can find at any basic store for $50.  This year for my birthday he bought me the Dyson hair styler for $600.  I told him repeatedly that I didn\u2019t want it, we are saving for a house, I have a ton of legal bills because my ex husband is a nightmare, this was a stupid purchase.  And I\u2019m 44, I don\u2019t need this.  This is more suitable for a hair stylist or someone much younger.  \nTonight I planned a date night for us since I received a ton of gift cards for Christmas.  We were able to really splurge.  I\u2019m an early bird and he\u2019s a night owl and there is no changing either of us.  There are times that we are passing ships, so I was really looking forward to this.  \nWe had plans to get a last minute gift for his sister at 2pm today.

By 5pm I checked in on him and he told me he was at the store we were supposed to go to and he was in line with a hundred other people.  (He\u2019s also notoriously late for everything, so this already irked me.). I asked if he got the gift that I needed, which is for his sister.  He said no.  I was really pissed at that moment.  I let my kids use my car for winter break since I don\u2019t drive much and walk to work and they need it for their part time jobs.  So I don\u2019t have the option to just run out and get something myself.  Most would think we could go tomorrow, but he is golfing.  \nI was getting ready when he got home and I made the effort to start using the hair styler and he immediately started ragging on me to watch the tutorial.  He has a HORRIBLE habit of repeating himself over and over and over.  I said, I know you watched the tutorial, but I don\u2019t have time right now.  He kept going and I lost it.

When you resent a partner enough, anything they do, even if kindly intentioned will just get under your skin. The way you talk about him--he got you these gifts that you hate, he's always repeating himself--just let the man go.  I'm sure someone else will appreciate him.\n\nIt will be a difficult adjustment, but if things have degraded this far and you're posting on the internet about it, long run everyone will be better off.", "NTA, but reconsider this relationship. Besides the fact that you seem easily annoyed by everything he does, he is obviously not listening to you or hearing you. If you two can\u2019t sit down to properly communicate your needs and actually hear each other out - maybe it\u2019s time to move on.", "Nta. It seems like he's not listening to what your goal is as a couple. The wreckless spending for gifts is counterproductive. He should listen more", "Hmmm...\n\nHis behavior is so immature that it's hard to know if this is real.  He knows what he needs to do and what he should be doing and he knew you wouldn't want him to spend that much on a hair dryer before he spent the money, so what' up with him?", "with respects to the dyson and iknow this is your opinion but....im not young but older than you and last year i bot a dyson and let m e tell u it was life changing for my hair and ppl comment on it all the time.   if some partner wanted to buy me a dyson or two i would kiss their feet.  but i suspect your problems with your partner go waaaaaaaaay deeper than him spending money on expensive ticketed items", "NTA\n\nHe probably was hurt in the moment, but he didn't listen to you when you said you didn't want it", "I have a appliance sitting here that when I was asked if I wanted it after being shown a commercial if I wanted it, and I said no, well Merry Christmas to me. And guess who got upset when it was delivered and I wasn\u2019t happy with it??? He was going to send it back but git offered a 60 plus refund to keep it, so I agreed to try it out for that. A learning curve with it that even the instructions pretty much say so btw. Had to have a table that could roll ordered to put it on because if you use steam it can ruin the cabinets. (One reason I didn\u2019t want it, another you have to use their pans for the most part and can\u2019t make toast as well as it claims to name a few cons). Not the first time I have been specific with what I wanted or didn\u2019t want and might as well say I wasted my breath. Point I am getting out, he won\u2019t be changing. If he wants you to have something you best be happy with it even if he knew you wouldn\u2019t be. He is high maintenance. NTA. Even if I thought you were I would still say nope because it\u2019s just so annoying to be on the end of insanity growlers.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
