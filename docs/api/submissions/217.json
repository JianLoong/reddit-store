Basically, the type to nit pick because they genuinely DONT have more important things to do. I kinda empathize with that, but it's very frustrating. \n\nI have one particular neighbor that has been a big pain in my butt. When she was moving in, I was walking in, so I held the door and helped her carry a few boxes. And then she saw my rainbow door mat, realized I roll with the LGBTQ community, and her demeanor towards me completely changed. She put some homophobic stuff up, but it was taken down before I talked to management; maintenance handled it. She's also tried to get me in trouble for working from home and complains how often I'm home? I don't make noise, I work silently mostly, so it doesn't make a lot of sense. Anyhoo, I have a couple disabilities and that's why I'm home so much. Hard to be in public with my service dog; people aren't kind. \n\nTied to my disabilities, is my cannabis use. It helps with the pain and the emotions better than anything else, and I make sure to use it sparingly. I smoke outside only, at night when nobody else is around to catch any second hand. I also use a filter for exhaling, I don't let anything burn freely, and my smoke sesh doesn't take more than 5 minutes. \n\nThat neighbor who dislikes me has been trying to catch me to turn me in to property management, who does not care as long as I'm not smoking inside.   I've heard her talking shit loudly about me and smoking weed a few times, and I've also heard other neighbors tell her to shut up and that it's legal. She also smokes cigarettes on her patio at all hours of the day, as do many of my other neighbors, and does nothing to limit the second hand. \n\nLast night, she sat out in her car and kept taking pictures of me when I went on my patio, trying to get evidence. I like to take my pets out there for fresh air/ a view in turns, I do yoga there, I have plants, etc.-- I was doing normal stuff. So she didn't get any evidence. But she's making me feel uncomfortable and stalked in my own home. \n\nShe has complained a lot, about everything I do, but she's pretty focused on the weed. She's gotten me inspected 6 times and convinced security to roll by my apartment constantly. I just wave at them now, they wave back, and that's that. The complex is just placating her; they don't care. She also called the cops but it was like 2 am/it's legal, so they just told her it was legal and left. \n\nAm I the bad guy here? I know there's strong opinions on cannabis, but I do what I can to manage the nuisance that I create and I have seen many others doing the same.

For what it's worth, none of my other neighbors knew I was doing it until she said so. I limit the smoke pretty well and filter out the second hand. :) I have a little lid for the bowl piece that deprives it off oxygen/stops the smoking immediately, so very little of it escapes filtering.
