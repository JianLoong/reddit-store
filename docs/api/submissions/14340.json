It would, unfortunately, be best if you had a copy of the paper. Also I\u2019m unfortunately concerned about you protecting yourself from any false accusation from this student about actions toward her. She might lash out if she realizes she is in hot water. \n\nExpecting someone, even someone with autism, to stop writing relationship or physical porn about you is not an unreasonable ask. You have a right to not be sexually harassed. I understand that kids under 18 will make comments and such from time to time and be assholes, but her actions are way beyond that. You asked her to stop. And she did not. Having her removed from the classroom is a logical step. The school recommended removing her!!! The school obviously had a prior opinion about an appropriate classroom replacement for her that was the equivalent of your class - so she would still be receiving a free and appropriate education. It seems like the school needs to be forced to choose which lawsuit to deal with. It seems to me it would be cheaper for them to some else tutor for a period in your subject matter than deal with either of you having a lawyer. \n\nI also wonder what she is reading online that 1) exposed her to this type of writing 2) let her feel like this type of writing was appropriate 3) share it with you in the first place!!!

She RPF'd you (real person fiction). It's a subgenre in fanfic/online roleplay and a lot of people dislike it when it strays from writing fanfic about two characters and bleeds into the actors themselves. And that's just with celebrities. Her writing sexual fanfic about two male teachers in her school shows what she's into and that she's aware enough to write it. And there's nothing wrong with being uncomfortable about it. Her parents aren't doing her any favors.

It is not ok for students to be discussing school staff in this way because it promotes an unhealthy classroom environment in which students are objectifying the staff instead of focusing on education.
