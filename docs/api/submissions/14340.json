Someone's disability isn't a free pass to make other people uncomfortable, especially not like this. You directly told her to stop, so it has nothing to do with understanding social cues.

Do her parents know she was writing porn about you? Or do they think she was removed from your class for some other reason? Maybe I'm just old (32), but back in my day most parents wouldn't allow their 13 or 14yo child to write porn, much less about real people in their lives.
