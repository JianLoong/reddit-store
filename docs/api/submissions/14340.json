As someone that has a family member that has autism and is also a child, autistic people are NOT incapable of learning social boundaries and what inappropriate behavior is. Inappropriate behavior needs to be corrected and needs to have consequences. Not doing so just like you would to every other child, and coddling them as though they are incapable of learning, does not do them any favors in life and actually only sets them up for failure.", "NTA!

Tbf I wish you had told her that from the start and not at the end. Maybe try to have a conversation with her and explain to her why you feel this way.

When she first started bringing the stories to you did you contact the SPED department or the school counselor for tips on how to handle this issue? Did you contact admin for strategies on this issue? \n\nRomance themes with inappropriate content is very common in middle school and especially with kids on the spectrum (having worked in SPED for years and having to deal with this every year with my middle school students). There are strategies for how to effectively handle these situations and move past them but you have to actually find out what those are and then implement them.", "INFO: admin recommended that you request she be removed from your class, so you did.

Explain that you had already asked her to stop, but she didn't and that moving her to another class isn't  punishing her, but for your own comfort. Then have them read the story, and ask them how they would respond if someone, even someone with autism, wrote a similar story about them or their daughter. How would they react?", "NTA. Someone's disability isn't a free pass to make other people uncomfortable, especially not like this. You directly told her to stop, so it has nothing to do with understanding social cues. Talk to your union rep and don't trust your admin or anyone at your school to have your back. Get that kid out of your class.", "NTA\n\nMy friend was expelled for this exact thing in 1996. He had to take his exams at a different school. He wrote a very detailed story about 2 male teachers in a homosexually relationship", "NTA. Children can commit crimes, too, and this is decisively sexual harassment. Remind admin of that, that you *could* be pressing charges, but you *of course* would never want to let the school be the school that had to sue a student for harassment, and let them figure out which problem is easier to solve (but be prepared to follow through- this is a very dangerous situation that you cannot keep operating within, I'm sure you understand that)", "NTA. Do her parents know she was writing porn about you? Or do they think she was removed from your class for some other reason? Maybe I'm just old (32), but back in my day most parents wouldn't allow their 13 or 14yo child to write porn, much less about real people in their lives. In fact, when I was in high school, I had a peer who got grounded for months after she was busted reading fanfic smut on the family computer.", "I agree. My daughter is on the spectrum and coddling definitely doesn\u2019t help her excel in life. It can be difficult because she is my life but I also understand I\u2019m doing her a disservice if I constantly make everything a bubble for her. To the OP this could also have to do with her trying to fit in with her peers. Not that it makes it right what she did but it makes me wonder what other kids are talking about and doing around her. Girls on the spectrum have a hard time in social settings but genuinely want to be social so they will mimic other girl\u2019s behaviors, it\u2019s called \u201cmasking\u201d. Regardless if this is the case or not you are NTA", "The parents are threatening a lawsuit for rights to FAPE so admin is not backing me up anymore in fear of getting sued", "Usually no, she was generally understanding when she was made aware", "He clearly says he did tell her to stop, then she went ahead and kept writing about it, which he found out about when someone reported it.", "Sounds like you need to threaten to sue the school for turning a blind eye to a student sexually harassing you.", "I think you should turn it right back on them and threaten to sue them for allowing sexual harassment take place. Disability is not a free pass to act like an asshole.", "I think you need to talk to your union. A teenage girl with a vivid imagination is a dangerous thing at the best of times. Also you need to communicate you are not comfortable ever being in a situation alone with her due to her stories. I am not saying she will do anything but she might try it then get upset when you reject her.", "NTA - unless there\u2019s something else specified in her EP you could have done, I think you were reasonable given the situation. \n\nAutism, especially in someone who has a history of being able to modify behavior when they\u2019re made aware of inappropriateness, does not give her a pass. Her parents should be talking to her about why she continued, and help process and accept responsibility for her actions. 8th grade is pretty old for her parents to be putting this on you, as if it\u2019s somehow your fault.", "NTA\n\n> Her parents are livid and are accusing me of discriminating her\n\nNot wanting to be around someone engaging in sexual harrassment - even a child - is not discrimination.\n\n> that she doesn't understand social situations \n\nYou directly asked her to stop. Autism can mean people can miss social cues, it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t know what stop is. And in this case a natural consequence - that you no longer feel comfortable with her in your classroom and she needs to be removed - should be a good lesson.\n\n> and needs more help \n\nThe adult who she is writing romantic and sexual fiction about is not the person to do that. \n\n> and punishing her for her disability is illegal.\n\nShe is not being punished for her disability.\nI\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s fair to call it a punishment to be honest. \n\nYou have a right to a safe work environment free from sexual harrassment; this student has refused to stop engaging in deeply inappropriate behavior towards you.", "NTA\n\nSure, autism causes development issues. But does it need to be a reason for making scandalous content? Of REAL, MARRIED or SUPERIOR people? Something should be done in order to avoid this kind of harassment. It's extremely inappropriate and should be controlled.\n\nRemember, disabilities are NOT always valid reasons. It can be about the lack of discipline, or something else.", "Real life Tina Belcher", "NTA admin and school unions etc do not always take the right stance. They will do what they think is best for the school. Get a lawyer.", "It is not punishment to move her to a different classroom. \n\nAnd she can understand being told to stop doing something. There is no nuance there. You made it clear and asked her to not doing a specific thing, and she continued to do it.\n\nIf they really want to push this, let them, and admin know, you will have no choice but to report Becky for sexual harassment, along with admin for allowing it to happen. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You told her to stop and she continued, the parents are using her autism to justify her misbehaving and would not help her to act better.", "NTA. I'm tired of students getting away with bad behavior to the detriment of teachers' mental and physical health. Props to your school for doing the right thing. Also, this child's parents are doing her no favors with their enabling behavior.", "NTA but this needed escalating much faster. You should have told her you were uncomfortable from the first story and been in talks with her parents from the second.", "NTA at all. Her parents are in denial if they think she doesn't know what she is doing. She is using her diagnosis of autism to sexually harass you and the other teacher in the story. Stay far far away from her.", "Not sure how old 8th grade is in your country (12?) but I would be seeing red flags in a child of that age producing highly sexualised content. \n\nChildren with disabilities are disproportionately victims of sexual assault. \n\nNTA for what you've done, but I hope someone is asking questions about the broader context.", "I expect that the broader context is that she reads RPF fanfic online, like many teens her age (probably 13-14). But writing stories about real people you know is different from writing them about celebrities, and she needs to learn that right now.", "You need to check your local laws about assault/harassment of teachers ASAP. I know that my local laws combined physical assault and sexual harassment in the same law that has the consequence of expulsion for the student if proven true. If your school is not backing you, they could very well be breaking the law. \n\nAsking for a student to moved into another classroom instead of being possibly expelled IS helping the student.", "Your attorney can read her little porn stories for the jury and judge."]}
