She might lash out if she realizes she is in hot water. \n\nExpecting someone, even someone with autism, to stop writing relationship or physical porn about you is not an unreasonable ask. You have a right to not be sexually harassed. I understand that kids under 18 will make comments and such from time to time and be assholes, but her actions are way beyond that. You asked her to stop. And she did not. Having her removed from the classroom is a logical step. The school recommended removing her!!! The school obviously had a prior opinion about an appropriate classroom replacement for her that was the equivalent of your class - so she would still be receiving a free and appropriate education. It seems like the school needs to be forced to choose which lawsuit to deal with. It seems to me it would be cheaper for them to some else tutor for a period in your subject matter than deal with either of you having a lawyer. \n\nI also wonder what she is reading online that 1) exposed her to this type of writing 2) let her feel like this type of writing was appropriate 3) share it with you in the first place!!!

NAH b/c OP needs to get his administration involved and not handle this alone.", "As someone who is also autistic and read/wrote m/m fanfiction in MS and HS, I personally am making presumptions based on how she was described.  For example, if there were violent outbursts or other impulse control dysfunctions,  not only would op have mentioned that, the kid would likely be in a special needs class. It's clearly indicated that while she is obviously autistic, she is still able to be held to a similar standard as non-autistic people, at least as far as this specific scenario goes.", "typically speaking an autistic person who is in a general education class for english is most likely not a very high support needs person who is nonverbal and inable to read", "I'm not a fan of real person fic (I think it's always pretty creepy), but I can at least appreciate that back in the live-journal days people would keep it in locked communities so that no one but a very select audience could find it.\n\n...And now that I've done a 'back in my day' I guess I've got to go yell at the kids to stop playing on my lawn.", "I can already tell without verification she spends far too much on Ao3, tumblr or another site hosting fanfic in the real people sections.", "Tell me you don't read romance novels without telling me you don't read romance novels", "I read romance novels plenty as a kid. There\u2019s a big jump between a fictional story with obvious fake charecters versus writing smut about a very real person who\u2019s opposed and asked you to stop multiple times.", "Smut is not \"stories about real people\" , so when you write \"there's a difference between romance novels and smut\", you are understood as saying the smut is more sexually explicit than romance novels, which is not categorically true. There are plenty of romance novels with lots of explicit sexual descriptions.\n\nOf course there is a difference between writing fiction (of any kind) about people you have a personal relationship to and showing it to the people you wrote about (or your mutual acquaintances) and writing fiction about imaginary characters."]}
