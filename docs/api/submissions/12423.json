Where I'm coming from those are smart and indipendent and strong enough not to succumb to the social pressure. Most of the people who are chilfree for life are childfree because they are not selfish!

It's one of the many reasons my husbands family refuse to have anything to do with me and us because we refuse to breed. What gets me is people always demand answers from the WOMEN why she won't but never from the MEN!", "YTA. Sadie is right, she gave  your parents *her* reasons for not wanting kids.\n\nIf your parents are bugging you, that's on them, nit Sadie. She didn't 'throw you under the bus', she answered the question they asked her, honestly, about her reasons. It didn't have anything to do with you at all.\n\nIf your parents are making the assumption that her reasons are also yours, that's on them.  \n\nRepeat what you've told them before. \"*Nothing's changed, I've been clear for years that I don't want children, it has nothing to do with being 'selfish', and everything to do with the fact that I strongly believe that it is inappropriate to bring children into the world unless you actively want them, I haven't ever felt that desire, and it would be cruel to deliberately create an unwanted child.\"*\n\nIf they raise the things Sadie said then say something like \"*Those are Sadie's views, not mine.

It's very sensible fo her to chose not to go down that route if she feels that she might resent the child'*\n\nI think you owe Sadie an apology, and really, you'd do better to cooperate with each other to help shut down this line of complaints or comments from your parents as soon as it starts rather than turning on each other.

What's wrong with admitting you won't be a good parent because you don't want to give up your freedom? I would have rather my parents didn't have me all willy nilly despite not actually wanting children, but here I am and now I get to make the decision not to continue the cycle of bringing children into a world where they are not wanted.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she knows herself well.

It's not her job to protect you and your parents' feefees.", "YTA. It was her reason, not yours. It's not her fault, that your parents think, it is the same reason you don'T want to have children. Maybe try to explain it to them differently", "YTA.  You're using terms like \"selfish\" (like that's a bad thing when it comes to your time money and energy) and \"lazy\" (she knows her limits on energy) to describe a choice that millions of women and men are making.  When you're making the choice for supposedly \"better\" reasons?  Naw.  Her reasons are just as valid as yours.  \n\n\nTo be honest, when you think about climate change (perpetuating consumption beyond your death), the likelihood of being a single mother at some point, and the abysmal support the US gives parents (should be clear after the pandemic), I think people need to think long and hard about having kids.  And that's not even including time, energy, money, not actually wanting kids, etc.\n\nOnce people start making a conscious choice, the chances of being CF only go up.", "She gave an honest answer.

You could have told them that the better question is \u201cwhy do you want kids?\u201d as you eloquently suggested at the beginning of your post. You could have said that the future of your uterus is yours to decide and they should drop it. You could have said you\u2019re offended by their insistence. You chose a laconic \u201cI lack desire\u201d and that\u2019s up to you.\n\nSadie opted to say what she said. It has nothing to do with you so you should get off her back.", "INFO: What are you specifically mad about here? Has she expressed to you that this isn't actually her opinion and she's just saying it to shut them up, regardless of what she actually feels and how it affects anyone else?\n\nOr are you just assuming that's not how she feels?\n\nLeaning towards you being the problem here, but need to hear more. Everyone gets to choose whether to have or not have children, and I completely agree it should be \"opt-in enthusiastically,\" not \"need a reason to opt-out,\" but by the same notion, your sister gets to have her own reasons too.\n\nBy the same notion you can feel free to lay al of this out for your parents and end the conversation, permanently, too. If you feel like she passive aggressively threw you under the bus, you're not required to extricate yourself from the situation in a way that preserves her image with your parents.\n\nFor example, you could address your parents as follows:\n\n\"Look, I love you both, but this conversation is over. I'm neither lazy nor selfish for not wanting children, I believe people who take on being parents should be enthusiastically entering into it, not cajoled into it by their family, desperate for a last chance at grandchildren. Sister has chosen to make her reasoning for not wanting to have childen be about her own flaws of being lazy and selfish, and while I won't disagree at all that she is both of those things, please don't attempt to emotionally blackmail me into having children and changing my entire life to conform to your wishes based on her admitted flaws. Her problems and her flaws are her own--they are not mine, just as your dreams of grandchildren are yours and they are not mine, and likewise, your disappointment is not my problem to solve. I don't want to hear about this ever again, and if you bring it up again, I'll end the conversation and leave the room/go home. I do not want children,  and I won't be having them, and I will not brook any further discussion of it beyond the end of this sentence.\"\n\nThen follow through: If they start hectoring you about grandkids, leave the room. If they continue, leave and go home. If they still won't stop, consider drastically reducing your contact level with all of them.", "YTA stop being pissed at your sister when the people you're really angry with are your parents but won't tell them or put boundaries in place with them.

If you don't see it as selfish, fine, but she sees it as selfish. Have you considered that maybe you're the one with the problem here? Maybe you need to stop assigning moral components to the words people use to describe themselves.", "YTA. Sadie isn\u2019t responsible for setting and fortifying boundaries that you set with others.

And tell your parents to back off or you will go no/low contact.", "Based on the information provided, I would say NTA. You have a right to your own feelings and choices regarding having children. It's unfortunate that your sister's explanation made your parents view both of you negatively. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own reasons for choosing not to have children, and it's not fair to assume that one person's reasons apply to everyone else.

If they still want grandchildren then tell them to open a daycare. If you don\u2019t want a child, you shouldn\u2019t have one to make someone else happy. Because you don\u2019t get a break as a Mom.
