I would tell them firmly that those are her reasons. You have your own. You may decide to share them someday, you may not. You are sure this is what you want though.

Why do you even need to list a reason, it is your choice and you can change your mind if you want!  Do not piggyback on her and her decision in life you are an individual.  Also every reason for not having kids is a valid one, she doesnt need to hide or lie for your convenience, and what even does this mean **-perpetuate the childfree stereotype?** Are you saying childfree people are selfish? Where I'm coming from those are smart and independent and strong enough not to succumb to the social pressure. Most of the people who are chilfree for life are childfree because they are not selfish!

In fact she shows great self awareness and is clearly very courageous in not sugar coating her feelings.\n\nLike you, I've never had the desire and like your sister I also have no desire to lose myself and the life I've created (which includes everything she listed).\n\nMaybe spend some time reflecting on your underlying feeling here. It sounds like there might be more too this because your reaction seems extreme to me", "I'm female, 57, happily married and can't stand kids, decided when I was 6 I never wanted any. I've only ever been a happy mum to animals. I've had loads of idiots demanding why I won't have them and I tell them straight ''mind your own business, you interfering old git!'' It's one of the many reasons my husbands family refuse to have anything to do with me and us because we refuse to breed. What gets me is people always demand answers from the WOMEN why she won't but never from the MEN!", "YTA. Sadie is right, she gave  your parents *her* reasons for not wanting kids.\n\nIf your parents are bugging you, that's on them, nit Sadie. She didn't 'throw you under the bus', she answered the question they asked her, honestly, about her reasons. It didn't have anything to do with you at all.\n\nIf your parents are making the assumption that her reasons are also yours, that's on them.  \n\nRepeat what you've told them before. \"*Nothing's changed, I've been clear for years that I don't want children, it has nothing to do with being 'selfish', and everything to do with the fact that I strongly believe that it is inappropriate to bring children into the world unless you actively want them, I haven't ever felt that desire, and it would be cruel to deliberately create an unwanted child.\"*\n\nIf they raise the things Sadie said then say something like \"*Those are Sadie's views, not mine. She and I are two different people with 2 different sets of reasons for our choices. I'm neither lazy nor selfish, but it would be incredibly selfish for me to have a child just because you want to be grandparents, knowing that I couldn't give them the love and care they deserve.*  \n\n *I'm not prepared to discuss this any further. If you want to discuss it with Sadie that's up to you, but we are both grown adults and entitled to make the choices we feel are appropriate for us*\"\n\nIdeally, you'd also add '*and it's not selfish of Sadie to have decided that she doesn't want children.  It's very sensible fo her to chose not to go down that route if she feels that she might resent the child'*\n\nI think you owe Sadie an apology, and really, you'd do better to cooperate with each other to help shut down this line of complaints or comments from your parents as soon as it starts rather than turning on each other. A blanket \"We've both told you our choices, this isn't up for discussion any more. \"", "Yeah, YTA. Your and your sister's decision regarding kids are personal, and you both can only speak for yourselves. Sadie spoke about her decision, and didn't mention you, and you have that option as well.

What's wrong with admitting you won't be a good parent because you don't want to give up your freedom? I would have rather my parents didn't have me all willy nilly despite not actually wanting children, but here I am and now I get to make the decision not to continue the cycle of bringing children into a world where they are not wanted.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she knows herself well. Knowing you're too selfish to have kids is an excellent reason not to have kids.\n\nSadly, too many people do not realize this and have them anyway.", "Sadie said she has every right to tell our parents whatever she wants and it's not her fault they are the way they are and that I can't stand up for myself.

If they\u2019re not yours, tell them that yourself.", "YTA but for confronting Sadie. She didn't \"throw you under the bus\". She simply gave her own reason (which tbh is valid). It's not her job to protect you and your parents' feefees.", "YTA. It was her reason, not yours. It's not her fault, that your parents think, it is the same reason you don'T want to have children. Maybe try to explain it to them differently", "YTA.  You're using terms like \"selfish\" (like that's a bad thing when it comes to your time money and energy) and \"lazy\" (she knows her limits on energy) to describe a choice that millions of women and men are making.  When you're making the choice for supposedly \"better\" reasons?  Naw.  Her reasons are just as valid as yours.  \n\n\nTo be honest, when you think about climate change (perpetuating consumption beyond your death), the likelihood of being a single mother at some point, and the abysmal support the US gives parents (should be clear after the pandemic), I think people need to think long and hard about having kids.  And that's not even including time, energy, money, not actually wanting kids, etc.\n\nOnce people start making a conscious choice, the chances of being CF only go up.", "She gave an honest answer. Whats your special reason that is so much better.", "Yta. Could it possibly be that you took offense because she called reasons you agree with selfish and lazy?", "Sorry OP, but YTA\n\nYou\u2019re angry at the wrong person.

And they are valid reasons. TBH it doesn't matter why she doesn't want to, and your parents are TA for demanding an explanation from the both of you in the first place. You are TA for blaming her for your parents' behavior. \n\nYou said you don't want kids and communicated why. Not Sadie's fault that your parents won't accept either.", "YTA.

You\u2019re misplacing your anger. You could have stood up to your nosy parents in a number of ways. You could have told them that the better question is \u201cwhy do you want kids?\u201d as you eloquently suggested at the beginning of your post. You could have said that the future of your uterus is yours to decide and they should drop it. You could have said you\u2019re offended by their insistence. You chose a laconic \u201cI lack desire\u201d and that\u2019s up to you.\n\nSadie opted to say what she said. It has nothing to do with you so you should get off her back.", "INFO: What are you specifically mad about here? Has she expressed to you that this isn't actually her opinion and she's just saying it to shut them up, regardless of what she actually feels and how it affects anyone else?\n\nOr are you just assuming that's not how she feels?\n\nLeaning towards you being the problem here, but need to hear more. Everyone gets to choose whether to have or not have children, and I completely agree it should be \"opt-in enthusiastically,\" not \"need a reason to opt-out,\" but by the same notion, your sister gets to have her own reasons too.\n\nBy the same notion you can feel free to lay al of this out for your parents and end the conversation, permanently, too. If you feel like she passive aggressively threw you under the bus, you're not required to extricate yourself from the situation in a way that preserves her image with your parents.\n\nFor example, you could address your parents as follows:\n\n\"Look, I love you both, but this conversation is over. I'm neither lazy nor selfish for not wanting children, I believe people who take on being parents should be enthusiastically entering into it, not cajoled into it by their family, desperate for a last chance at grandchildren. Sister has chosen to make her reasoning for not wanting to have childen be about her own flaws of being lazy and selfish, and while I won't disagree at all that she is both of those things, please don't attempt to emotionally blackmail me into having children and changing my entire life to conform to your wishes based on her admitted flaws. Her problems and her flaws are her own--they are not mine, just as your dreams of grandchildren are yours and they are not mine, and likewise, your disappointment is not my problem to solve. I don't want to hear about this ever again, and if you bring it up again, I'll end the conversation and leave the room/go home. I do not want children,  and I won't be having them, and I will not brook any further discussion of it beyond the end of this sentence.\"\n\nThen follow through: If they start hectoring you about grandkids, leave the room. If they continue, leave and go home. If they still won't stop, consider drastically reducing your contact level with all of them.", "YTA stop being pissed at your sister when the people you're really angry with are your parents but won't tell them or put boundaries in place with them.  Your sister told your parents her reasons for not wanting kids and you told them yours.  It's not her fault they respect her answer more than yours.", "YTA. Your sister shouldn't have to lie about the reasons for her decision to remain childless to get your parents off your back. Grow a spine and set up some boundaries.", "YTA. Can you help me understand where she threw you under the bus? Her response is a valid and true reason to not want kids.

She also is not responsible for dealing with your parents' expectations on your behalf.", "YTA. \n\nIf you don't think she's lazy, that's fine, but *she* thinks that's the best word to explain her behavior. If you don't see it as selfish, fine, but she sees it as selfish. Have you considered that maybe you're the one with the problem here? Maybe you need to stop assigning moral components to the words people use to describe themselves.", "YTA. Sadie isn\u2019t responsible for setting and fortifying boundaries that you set with others. Your parents being overbearing isn\u2019t Sadie\u2019s fault.", "YTA and your edit doesn't make you any less the AH. Let's give an example, if a 20 year said \"I'm lazy and don't like working\", does it give anybody the right to say all 20 yr olds are lazy?

How dare you say that your reason is more valid than hers , especially as a woman.", "I'm going against the grain and say the parents are the aholes in this one. You and your sister are now turning against each other so yes YTA for not respecting her reasons but mostly your parents because no the 2 of you are bickering about it. Apologize to your sister. And tell your parents to back off or you will go no/low contact.", "Based on the information provided, I would say NTA. You have a right to your own feelings and choices regarding having children. It's unfortunate that your sister's explanation made your parents view both of you negatively. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own reasons for choosing not to have children, and it's not fair to assume that one person's reasons apply to everyone else.

Especially as a queer person (I'm bi).\n\nComparing to lesbians doesn't make sense. Lesbians, by definition, like women. They won't be lesbian for male attention, because by definition you are not lesbian in that case. It is not a stereotype, it is just simply wrong and invalidating the lesbian identity. It implies lesbians don't exist. \n\nBut child free is not just because you are selfish and lazy. Inherently, you can be lazy and selfish and be child free, or you could be the opposite of lazy and selfish and still be child free. Your sister choosing lazy and selfish as her own descriptor is not wrong. It is not invalidating being child free, because it doesn't imply being child free doesn't exist. It is just a reasoning for why.\n\nI'll give you a better comparison. In the bi community there is this stereotype that bi women love a threesome. It is super annoying that you have abf who you think is nice and he then asks if you would like a FFM threesome, because that way both of you get something out of it, like there isn't a lot more involved in being bi. Being bi doesn't even imply you love both women and men equally, it might differ. There is a lot of pushback on that stereotype from the bi community. But you know? Some bi women actually like a FFM threesome and jump at the opportunity. The might even say \"so glad I'm bi because how boring would threesome be otherwise!\" you know what the bi community doesn't? Telling those women they are wrong and should stop telling people their bisexuality means they like threesome. Because for them individually that is the case. It just doesn't reflect the same for the whole bi community. \n\nSo sure, is there pushback from the child free community that being childfree doesn't mean you are lazy and selfish? I believe you on that, makes total sense. How horrible for someone seeing you as selfish purely based on your wish to not have children, like you aren't a whole person beyond possible children. But that doesn't mean that an individual like your sister can't still identify with that idea that she is too lazy and selfish to have children. That is her choice. And her individual choice to identify with those words does not in any way reflect back to you or the childfree community.\n\nBut your parents do see it as reflecting back on you. That is simply not true. That is just how your parents choose to see it. And I think it is absolutely disgusting that your parents, who know you as the whole person you are, can reduce you to being selfish just like that. They are horrible people for that. Your parents. Not your sister.\n\nI get you hate the stereotype. But it isn't your sister's fault. It is the fault of your parents. Please put the blame where it belongs before your sister decides that on top of your parents she doesn't like a third judgemental person in her life. Because that is what you are doing.

It is not right to force a person to sacrifice their life and bodily rights for the benefit of another person. You cannot force someone to donate their organs to a living, breathing person even if it means that person will die without your donation. Heck, we cant even harvest organs from a dead person if they did not consent to be an organ donor when they were alive. Therefore a woman should not be forced to donate her body so a potential person can grow.\n\nAnd while yes, abortion can have many of the same effects, pregnancy and birth have a much higher risk. If we compare it to driving a car, abortion is like traveling 50km/hrs and pregnancy and childbirth is like traveling 100km/hr. You can still get into a car accident going at a slower speed, however the risks of more serious harm are lower than if you have been traveling at a faster speed.\n\nFor example:\nMost abortions take place before 12 weeks, when the fetus is about 2.3 inches long or less if the abortion occurs prior to 12 weeks. Its head circumfrence is about 1 inch. Conversely, a full term infant is on average, around 20 inches long with a head circumference of about 13 3/4 inches. Both will cause vaginal pain upon exit, however there is a much higher risk of vaginal tearing with the full term infant.\n\nNot to mention that a women at full term pregnancy is also more likely to require a major abdominal surgery (c-section) whereas a woman having an abortion at 12 weeks is much more unlikely to require major abdominal surgery.", "How many children have you adopted?", "Oh this old argument.\n\nGet some empathy for other people's situations that aren't your own.

I don't feel any particular caring instinct when it comes to seeing babies or children; especially in comparison with the caring instincts I feel when it comes to animals.  \n\nSo, I don't think there's any \"wrong\" reason, or \"more valid\" reason NOT to have children.   \n\nIn fact, I would say that not wanting children is the MOST valid reason not to have children -- because children should be very much wanted by both parents.  \n\nAnd that's the point that OP made, which so many people here seem to be glossing over (or not to have read in the first place).  OP lacks the desire to have children, and thinks that the decision to have children should be because you really really want to.  And that is the healthiest way to regard it.  \n\nHaving children because your parents want grandchildren is not a good reason, if you lack any other desire to have or raise children. Just, don't have children if your heart isn't in it.\n\nThe reason OP's sister's response is a problem is, just as OP said, that a lot of people regard not wanting to have children as the person being \"lazy\".  And \"lazy\" is a loaded word; it's a word used to say that someone has bad character, and is a bad person.  \"I just don't want the extra work\" or \"I just don't want early mornings\" isn't seen as the same thing as \"My heart isn't in it, and thus I couldn't give a child as much love and attention as a child deserves\".\n\nLet's be real, though -- that last statement will also be seen, by people who are being pushy about having children, as a statement that a person has bad character.   So, while OP's answer to the question is more neutral, it's not going to keep other people from regarding them as lazy, anyway.  \n\nAs OP says, thus far, they haven't gotten that much pressure from their parents, because their parents thought \"oh well, sister will give us grandchildren\".  Now that that's off the table, OP is going to experience more pressure, no matter how neutral they keep their statements, and no matter what the sister says.  Having children is considered such a societal default that you're going to get harsh criticism anwyay  from people who want you to have children, and can't think of any valid reason why you shouldn't.\n\nI don't think OP is an asshole for thinking their sister has given their parents more ammunition to attack BOTH of them on this issue.  I just think that OP has to realize that if their parents are panicking and desperate, no answer is going to satisfy them.  OP's own neutral answer won't be considered good enough either.\n\nI do kind of agree with OP that sister calling herself lazy is not doing anyone any favors.  Lazy is a word that gets over-used for people making choices that others don't like.  Sister really is NOT \"lazy\" for not wanting early mornings and more work, on top of what they already have to do for their life.  Sister is perfectly valid for realizing \\*how much money\\* it costs to have children, and thinking that she'd rather use her finite amount of money on other things.\n\nI get that it's hard for OP to hear sister call herself lazy, when it does mean that it gives their parents an easy criticism to latch onto and hound both OP and their sister with it.  Particularly if OP doesn't consider themselves \"lazy\" and objects to that being regarded as why they don't want kids.", "Yeah, I wonder how much their parents influenced their negative feelings about parenthood?\n\nLike maybe they guilt trip them over the effort they went into raising them, or maybe even perform actions with the expectation of receiving love in return. \n\nYTA but your parents are bigger YTA\u2019s", "Multiple people, all of them women, have told me (a woman) that a \u201cwoman\u2019s purpose in life\u201d is to be a mother.

That being said malpractice insurance is the highest for doctor's who perform births.\n\nThe reason the price tags are so high is so that the insurance company can say lookee here we gave you a 40% discount, so the price tag goes up 40% to cover this discount.

This. \n\nAlso, all these \"high class\" not wanting poor to have children---who do they think cooks their food, takes care of their children, cleans up trash, etc?", "Hahahaha, what a mature reply. Good for you!", "This x 1000", "Technically it's a human right and so is abortion. Also, rape and incest do exist and in those cases abortion is absolutely necessary. If a woman doesn't want a baby and is forced to have one, then it's either the sack of dead cells gets terminated or the criminal gets subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The only issue with my suggestion is that people will get salty because \"We shouldn't be subjecting criminals to cruel and unusual punishment\" despite the fact they just raped someone. While some standards should be taken into account when it comes to how criminals are dealt with, there are far too many people trying to overturn laws that do put criminals in their place. Plus, abortion is NOT and should never be on anyone's moral compass. Doesn't matter what people think about the conditions and survivability of a sack of dead cells. Human anatomy is not something that can be regulated by laws, yet it is being regulated by laws anyway. \n\nLaws regulating human bodily functions are direct violations of human rights. Now, before anyone dares to make the comparison of a man choosing to rape a woman to a woman getting abortion, rape and murder aren't the same thing, and while the points are similar since they both deal with choice, men DO NOT and CANNOT birth human children. Only women can give birth to human offspring. Men just fertilize. Abortion bans are perfect examples of violating human rights. It has already been proven numerous times that fetuses are NOT alive, therefore they aren't capable of having any sort of feelings. It would be like giving everyday objects rights. \n\nAlso, for anyone who also dares to try and quote something from a Bible, God and his son didn't condemn contraceptives and abortions. In fact, abortions and the use of contraceptives have been around for a LONG time. Jesus was silent on the matter because both were common practices and were not forbidden.\n\nAlso, if people are so hellbent on banning the elimination of dead cells, then why are they not calling for bans on men masturbating and ejaculating as well as using spermicide and condoms? While sperm cells are not fetuses, they do fertilize the eggs in female humans, so killing a sperm cell is preventing a child from being born since it can't fertilize an egg if it's dead."]}
