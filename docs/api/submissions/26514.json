We typically order delivery for Friday dinners and I was helping him decide on a restaurant. To be fair, I wasn't exactly focused on the search for a restaurant because I was doing work stuff on my laptop and I'm currently dieting so I wasn't going to eat anyway.\n\nDuring the search, we found a local place but I told him they were only available for pickup and not delivery. While focused on my laptop, I heard him say \"do I wanna go pick it up?\" as if he was debating on it. After some silence, I turned to him to ask if he decided on picking up food and he replies in an annoyed tone \"you JUST said they were only available for pickup.\"\n\nI brushed it off and we continued our search. \n\nHe then decided on getting pizza but became  agitated when the Pizza Hut app said they weren't available in our area. I remembered that Pizza Hut was available on Doordash so I opened the app, gave him my phone for him to choose, and went back to my laptop. I heard him say \"they don't have stuffed crust\" and after a few minutes, he hands back my phone without adding anything to the cart. Confused, I asked him \"so you decided not to get anything?\" to which he replied in an louder, exasperated tone \"I JUST SAID THEY DON'T HAVE STUFFED CRUST.\" He then takes out his own phone to check Doordash on his own.\n\nAt that point, I was fed up and went to the bedroom because it felt like he was being short with me for no reason and I didn't want things to escalate further.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he enters the bedroom and berates me for not considering the possibility that something was wrong with him and maybe that's why he was being short with me.\n\nI asked \"how am I supposed to know something is wrong if you're not telling me?\" to which he replies that he always asks what's wrong when I'm upset and take it out on him. He said that I didn't even bother to ask what's wrong and that not everything is about me.\n\nI felt blindsided. I didn't have any idea anything might've been wrong. Aside from him snapping at me over dinner options, nothing about his behavior all day indicated there was a problem. \n\nI tried to apologize for not considering the possibility that something might be wrong with him and not immediately being concerned, but now he won't speak to me.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, maybe I was just too focused on how he was talking to me and I should've picked up on the fact something was up.

It seems like it\u2019s a new occurrence and has never happened before which is why OP got blindsided. OP also said that he was upset that he always notices when she is upset but OP did not pay attention to him which the OP has admitted to doing because she was working. It\u2019s normal in any equation for this to happen, humans and their emotions are not perfect.
