This event is about his brother, Tom (32M) who was in my graduating class so I have known him longer than anyone else in the family.\n\nA little background on Tom, he was the class bully and is still a bit of a bully today. He used to make fun of kids in school who were \u201cdifferent\u201d or maybe had problems with learning and he not much has changed (think typical \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d toxic behavior).  We grew up in a pretty small town and Tom married Erika (31F) who was also in our class in school and was kind of mean to people as well.  For the record, I was never the target of their abuse.  Ultimately, when the three of us graduated, my BIL got into the family business, SIL attended a trade school and I left to join Jon in a large city for college.  We have remained in that city ever since.\n\nWe return to our hometown to visit our families and did so for a long weekend recently. Tom and Erika have 2 children, Allie (7F) and Matthew (5M). We have one child, Sam (4M). While I still find my BIL difficult to put up with, Erika has grown a lot and is a different person from who she was in high school.  The cousins do not see each other often so when we can get them together we try to do so and I really like Erika now.\n\nA few years ago, it became pretty clear that Matthew was not hitting his benchmarks.  I expressed my concern to Erika and suggested she seek some professional help so he can receive early intervention.  She agreed and my concern really just confirmed hers while my BIL kept making excuses.  After many months he was diagnosed with Autism.  He has been in therapies for the past few years but is still nonverbal and still in diapers.  This has become very distressing to my BIL and he is lashing out at doctors, therapists, and Erika.  My take is he knows how mean he was to kids like his son and now he is the parent of a disabled child.\n\nErika and I were talking and she asked if Jon would talk to Tom about how unproductive his behavior is and see if he would listen to his \u201cbig brother.\u201d I asked Jon to speak to him and he agreed. The next day, they were outside and Jon brought it up.  Tom immediately stormed off and came inside.  Erika asked what was wrong and Tom went off on her. I tried to calm him down and he started in on me and how I would never understand because my child is \u201chealthy.\u201d Then he said he was the one that deserves the \u201chealthy\u201d child since I\u2019m so okay with his son shitting in diapers at 5 years old.\n\nI said \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve a healthy child, no one is owed a healthy child.\u201d Well, this must have been the absolute worst thing to say because he kicked my family out and now I can't help but wonder if this comment really made me an AH.  My in-laws think he is overreacting, my husband is pissed at him and Erika has been secretly texting me and is really concerned about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I made this comment so I'll put it here too: the actual conversation was that my child isn't \"typical\" because I was owed or deserved a typical child and his child is not autistic because he was owed or deserved a disabled child.", "created_utc": 1679622042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12051fj/aita_for_telling_my_bil_he_doesnt_deserve_a/", "score": 2561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like the best course now is to keep supporting her as she helps her husband come to terms. Fair or not, he's got a lot of grief and adjustment ahead of him, and he doesn't seem to have matured much over the years. Idk if you were way out of line or if he chose to hear it that way.

Autistic children can be very high functioning & live relatively \"normal\" lives once they get the help & nurturing they need from EVERYONE in their lives.\n\nI see a divorce in your BIL's future if he doesn't change his ways. Erika needs to do what is best for her children & that may mean getting away from her husband's toxic behavior towards his children.\n\nI understand he's frustrated & probably exhausted from stress brought on by his son having autism, but he shouldn't be taking it out on everyone who is trying to help the son.\n\nNTA, and if I may suggest, you should try talking to Erika more & see where her head's at.

When you said \"My take is he knows how mean he was and now his child is disabled\", some are interpreting that to mean you're saying your take is that is why he now has a disabled child, not why you think he is lashing out, which is what you really meant.\n\nImo, I actually think the opposite- everybody deserves a healthy child but only because every child deserves to be healthy, not because of the parents themselves. But I don't think what you said was wrong or bad. I think it doesn't really matter what you say, though, BIL is not in the right mental state to listen to anything he doesn't want to hear. I hope he gets help before he does real damage to his family.", "NTA \n\nRegardless of his past history, your BIL needs help. For his son's sake, as well as his own.

Her mom had a difficult time accepting the diagnosis but at the same time would use it to throw a pity party for herself.\n\nIncredibly long story short, she only got daughter into therapy/psych help because she started to become aggressive when the internet ( her comfort crutch) is not working. Sedation is the only way to calm her down and keep her calm till it\u2019s fixed. The specialist who examined her concluded that she could have been much more functional had she received consistent treatment early on in life. Ultimately she functions like a 6-7 year old.  \n\nMy aunt passed away and left a major mess behind as no one can properly care for cousin, the two people in charge of her care and the worst options and Adult protective services doesn\u2019t care to even investigate.", "NTA.

You could have expressed your concerns or disagreements with his behavior in a more constructive and compassionate way. It's understandable that his behavior and attitude towards his son's disability is frustrating, but attacking him in this way is not the solution. It's important to remember that everyone is dealing with their own struggles and challenges, and it's important to approach them with empathy and understanding.", "ESH.

His reaction is completely understandable. \n\nOn top if that, his family decides to give him crap about his inability to cope rather than extending some grace in a horrible situation? \n\nI'm so glad my family didn't act like that when I was grieving my own child's diagnosis - especially when it was fresh. \n\nIt doesn't matter what he did before.

So Tom (understandably) reacted - it\u2019s very easy to say when it\u2019s not your hardship or mindset that needs to change.\n\nAnd throwing that BACK in his face with a pseudo-profound point was too much for him to take. Nobody deserves a healthy child? Yes, I understand how a logician could affirm that as a true statement. But *children* are innocent and *are* deserving of good health. As parents we will do anything to support them to be as healthy as they can be because they deserve it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole too, choosing to say something smart instead of showing your own humanity in a challenging moment as you so easily instructed Tom to do.", "YTA. \"You don't deserve a healthy child\" is unacceptable and toxic.

The life that you imagined for them.. it feels genuinely like something is taken from you. \n\nI'll restate this.  What Tom is going, it's not OK.  But having a disabled child is a kind of trauma and people react differently to traumas.  Tom needs help dealing with this, he's not OK, but getting angry at him and having a stupid argument like \"who disserves a healthy child\" is not going to resolve the issue. \n\nAlso something to note, divorce rates for parents of disabled children is astonishingly high. The levels of effort required, and that effort being a \"forever\" kind of thing, it breaks people.  I hope that Tom is able to get the help that he obviously needs.", "NTA, but slight Y T A for delivery. I know he was a bully, but I would have just said \"no one deserves a healthy child,\" and left it there. I'm pretty sure that Tom only heard the first part you said, and latched onto that to kick you out.\n\nPeople like him need someone to blame; barring that, someone to lash out at. He's probably going to twist your words and hold them over your head for as long as he can.", "By saying he deserve a \"healthy\" child he made himself the AH. How is a child with autism not HEALTHY? I know that they boy isn't neurotypical, but how can a parent be sooooo mean to his own son? He is acting like his son is less than, because he is on the spectrum. Like his son is worth less than your son. Nobody \"deserves\" a child. No matter if healthy, ill, neurotypical, neurodivergent.... Of course everyone wishes for the best life and future, but thats not how life works.\n\nIf i were SIL, i would kick Toms ass out on the street until he learns that he deserves no child at all. Tom should be happy that his son is healthy. That is what he IS. Healthy. He is not dying, nor in everyday pain. He is just not as typical as others.\n\nNTA for telling him how it is. Such an AH needs a bit of his own medicine, so he can think about his bullshit.", "NTA. You're right, no one is \"owed\" any sort of child, or children at all for that matter.", "NTA. \n\nYou have shown great compassion in your post and comments. Having a child comes with the risk of hardship around said child. That's just reality. Anyone suggesting otherwise is being willfully ignorant.", "NTA, however, as someone who has worked with many parent whose children have been diagnosed, I have to say dad's really do take it 6 with their sons. It is a grieving process, and yes, there is some anger involved and some denial. I get what you were trying to say, though. I wish I had some answers for you, but it's not easy. Unfortunately, this is a process that he is going to have to go through. The best you can do is listen and be there for him. Don't try to make a take of anything. I will also say not to assume this has anything to do with how he treated people in High school. I think your comment could have been worded better under the circumstances or I possibly I would have ignored it because your brother may have just been venting.", "NTA\n\nYour comment was clearly fair game bc he was suggesting something absurd, that having empathy and addressing his son's needs meant you are OK with it and since he ISNT, your kids should be the ones to have the issues. \n\nYou were just pointing out that deserving has nothing to do with anything.", "OP is absolutely NTA. My petty side wonders if someone should show BIL the articles about autism being passed paternally.", "NTA", "Nta you're just explaining science", "While you are not technically the AH here, I think you worded that badly. Not so much maybe for BIL, but you genuinely like Erika as you say and saying he does not deserve a healthy kid implys that neither does she.\n\nEvery kid deserves to be healthy, thus every parent deserves a healthy child. But nobody is owed a healthy child because. Simply because nobody is owed a kid.\n\nUnsure on the verdict on this one.", "I can see a lot of people on here are reading your comments in a couple of different ways. I\u2019m voting with the NTA group because I think you honestly meant it as \u2018this could happen to anyone, it\u2019s a fact of life sadly and there is no way that anyone gets a guarantee no matter what they do in life\u2019.\nOn to the BIL. He obviously has issues and prejudices that he is being forced to confront now. I may be wrong but I think he is going through the stages of grief/loss. The reason I say this is because I have been there. I was never a bully or any of that stuff but I developed a disability when I was in my late 20\u2019s. It changed my life and then meds used to treat it made me even worse. I was very ill for a while and when things levelled out I was not myself for a long time. I wish I had realised earlier as I could have done something about it sooner but I was going through these stages of loss/grief. I was mourning the life I thought I had and had been living and trying to accept a new reality. I got stuck around depression and as I say if I had realised earlier then I might have got past it sooner. It sounds like he is just getting past the denial stage and reaching anger. He is mourning the loss of the life he saw for his son and that can take a long time. He needs therapy but maybe if you guys can recognise the stages you can help him through since it doesn\u2019t sound like he would accept therapy would help. I hope he comes to terms with it soon.", "I totally thought you were going to throw it in his face as karma because he bullied children who were different, but you actually went in the opposite direction from what I was thinking.\n\nI was leaning towards YTA but you're right, no one deserves, is owed, or is entitled to a healthy child. Your job as a parent is to love your child and you don't get to choose your kid, just like kids don't get to choose their parents.\n\nI'm autistic and I know it caused difficulties for my parents and if they had the choice, they probably would have chosen a kid that wasn't autistic. It's sad but it's a truth for a lot of people.\n\nLogistically, children with learning disabilities and mental handicaps are more difficult than children without those same disabilities. It sounds mean but it's a fact. I am somewhat lucky in that yes, I'm autistic but I'm high functioning, whereas it sounds like your nephew is low or mid-functioning and will need a great deal of support in his life. That takes a lot from a family, it's difficult, it's expensive, it's time-consuming, it's logistically challenging. It is valid for your brother-in-law and sister-in-law to feel frustrated by the situation. Most parents do.\n\nHowever, BIL is wrong believing that he's entitled to a healthy kid. That's the risk you take when you conceive a child and everyone takes that risk. And he doesn't get to love his kid any less than he loves his other kids just because one of his children was born with a disability. He needs to step up as a parent and be there 100% for all of his kids. He didn't choose for his son to have a disability, but his son also didn't choose to have a disability. No one chose this, it's just how it worked out and now BIL has to deal with it.", "NTA and Tom is in desperate need of therapy. His world view is completely wrong.\nTalking about \"deserving\"  children to be a certain way... ugh. Where did he get the idea that health and strength are some karmic reward? He's obviously held this view since his teens.", "Also how I heard it.  NTA, OP.  I think you hit a double nerve on 1.  his child, and, 2. in general, BIL seems like the type to think he's \"owed\" a lot by the world and doesn't want to be told otherwise.  I'm glad SIL is stepping up, keep supporting her, you're doing the right thing.", "I think some people are seeing it like it's a karma thing. \n\nLike bil was an absolute ah to others in school, especially those with disabilities and now he's got a kid with disabilities. Karma just took a big bite out of him. \n\nBut theirs no explanation for autism, it just happens and it's because some was good or bad. \n\nI think op just wanted him to stop and accept that we all as parents want a healthy kid, but for whatever reason some come out needing more help. It's not as horrible as bil is making it out. \n\nMaybe it's karma, maybe it's not. But I agree, it's ironic that bully ends up having a child with a disability. \n\nThis situation will likely end up with the bil running away from the family and son, and only caring about the two kids who are \"healthy\". That poor kid will grow up without a father or one who doesn't love him. \n\nIf he's blowing up at everyone, then he blames everyone for the way his son is. He will leave because he didn't get the perfect family he wanted.", "Since you\u2019re top comment you might want to add your judgment", "If anything, this seems a bit like the universe trying to make him take a good long look in the mirror. But he hasn't really grown up and is squeezing his eyes closed to avoid doing so. He needs to check himself or he's going to be losing everything.", "He probably would bully disabled people as an adult too. He definitely gives off that kind of vibe from what I read.", "OTOH, not all autistic people will be high functioning in the sense of being employable and living independently. That doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t have a good and happy life. I have a child who will always need support, but I love her and will do what I can to give her a life she enjoys. \n\nSome parents need to re-think what their child\u2019s life will be and get behind the child they have, not the child they expected.", "Yup, I see a lot of parents trying to parent the kid they wanted instead of the one they had. Neither of mine are anything like I imagined years ago before having children, but half the fun is learning who they are and what makes them tick, and I wouldn't change them for the world.

What a great kid.", "She does. We are in constant contact.

In academic circles that is called the Fallacy of the Inverse or Denying the Antecedent.\n\nThe statement \"No one is owed a healthy child\" is not remotely the same as your implied opposite statement \"some do deserve unhealthy children\"\n\nThe first is true, no one is entitled to, or owed anything from life. These things just happen. Genetics are a complex and unpredictable thing. \n\nYour statement is obviously false and you already know that, because you're trying to conflate the two and say they're the same and therefore both false, but your comparison is not remotely accurate.", "You are right on the money here. Having a special needs child takes a lot. My husband is fully accepting and supportive and it\u2019s still hard AF. What\u2019s worse, this kid can see and sense that his father hates him and is going to grow up feeling like he is a burden and useless. I\u2019ve seen it too many times.", "Well said.", "I\u2019ve also seen \u201chigh support/low support needs,\u201d but none of these distinctions is particularly helpful. People can superficially seem to not require support, but actually have very complex support needs. Just like speaking and non-speaking or verbal/nonverbal, people make a lot of assumptions about how other people get by.", "When I read statistics like that, I\u2019m so thankful for my parents.", "The only ones who think it sounds like that are Tom (whose obviously an idiot) and a handful of people on Reddit who weren't there and apparently can't read very well.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if people misunderstand your story because of the title, which does sound bad out of context. But you are right that no parent \"deserves\" a healthy child, as disability is not some punishment for parents. Frankly the fact that he's referring to his child as \"unhealthy\" when their doesn't appear to be any actual health problems from your description is concerning. Autistic doesn't mean unhealthy.", "Not going to say YTA could have worded it better & he has a very shi*ty outlook on his child\u2019s condition, & him previously being a bully makes me feel like he\u2019s not going to be the most supportive or understanding with his child & his condition. Autism has so mean different levels, spectrums..it\u2019s a lot of work, patience, understanding.\nI hope things work out", "NTA. But I can see him completely abandoning his family. He does not seem to be taking this well", "NTA", "Well, I would have worded it slightly different but I get your meaning.  What the truth is, is we get the child, that we get.  Our child comes to us as they are, and we do not get a return guarantee.  Nothing was promised ever.  The child comes as is, and we do our best for them to be their best.  There is no default, there is no base model.  We are what we are.\n\nI am a autistic man, and I am raising an autistic son.  I make a good living.  I enjoy what I do and make six figure.  I get to be very very involved with my sons life as I have to be as a single parent.  I raise my son knowing that he has challenges, but not assuming what his potential is.  No one can know that.  What I know is the autism spectrum is a very wide spectrum, and no one can know the potential of any given child on the spectrum.  My son and I are a lot alike, like A LOT.  So I tell myself if I achieved something, so can he.  So far..................he has exceeded in many ways.  I feel validated to have a lot of faith in his potential, no matter if there's a few steps back and I learn about what it takes to raise him by listening and observing and ignore what a neurotypical child is doing.\n\nWith all that said your BIL needs a wake up call, and he needs it now.  Not for him, but for Michael.  When all people can focus on what Michael can't do, are in denial of, what he's not.  They aren't thinking about what he can do, what he needs, what he needs to move forward.  Yes he is behind, but that doesn't mean he will be that forever.  There are a great many autistic children who are performing behind their actual potential, not because of autism, but because they were written off.  Didn't get the attention and understanding they needed at these critical years.  Your BIL needs to wake up and stop complaining about what he feels he was owed, and start focusing on what he's got.\n\nIt's not confirmed, but highly theorized that Alan Turing might have been autistic.  He led the way to not only the end of WW2, but the computer which made the world we have today.  The world would literally be different today without him.  When I see a child even one on the spectrum not getting the attention they need, I wonder if that could have been the next Turing.  No one can know what any child's potential is.  You, Me, your BIL.  All we can do is give them the respect and what they need to be their absolute best.  Maybe your wording wasn't exactly the best, but it pales in comparison to the wake up call that your BIL needs.\n\nNTA in my opinion.", "NTA.  This was my take on it as well.  Not that BIL \"deserves\" a disabled child as punishment for his past wrong-doings... just that nobody is owed or entitled to a \"healthy\" child.\n\nNow if the comment struck a chord with BIL... well he can lace that shoe up and wear it.", "Yeah. When I was going through getting my kid a diagnosis, someone said \u201cGod never gives us more than we can handle\u201d as a way to express he thought I\u2019d be fine because he saw me as a caring, capable person. But what it made me feel was \u201coh, so if I was more of a fuckup, my kid would be normal?\u201d \n\nThere is no \u201cdeserves\u201d in parenting. We are not assigned easier or more difficult children based on some mystical lottery. BIL needs to pull his head out of his own ass and become a decent parent AND a decent human being. And yeah, my kid was six when he finally mastered pooping in the toilet. So I \u201cknow what it\u2019s like\u201d and can tell OP they are NTA.", "Honestly I\u2019m a little surprised he stuck it out this long.", "Idk my youngest of 3 (22, 15, 8) didn't fully potty train until almost 5 and she is now an 8 yo, that is excelling in school. She did need some school supports (counseling, speech therapy, intensive reading assistance) due to her own personal anxiety, as well as the death of her other parent at 3 yo. \n\nSo I wouldn't go completely off one or two metrics to place someone's level of \"functioning\". Especially since OPs BIL seems to be a huge a-hole and probably affects the kid(s) in many ways that could definitely cause issues in their development.", "Oh dear god, nobody tell Tom about Miracle Mineral Solution. \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16", "That's why I mentioned straight line. Just because a kid doesn't meet benchmarks at 2 years old or 5 years old doesn't mean that child can't improve later. Similarly, there are children who meet all the benchmarks at a very young age and then halt progression later. And there are some kids who blow away their benchmarks in some areas and then struggle with other benchmarks. Each kid is different, there's no set of rules for autism and you can't really predict how much support a child will need until later.", "There's literally nothing to do but accept it, move forward and figure out how to best support and love your ND child. Wtf exactly do you think he should be doing? \n\nA difficult situation, yes, but it doesn't seem to me from what was written that he's even *doing* anything productive for his child, nor is he seemingly supportive to his wife - she apparently just deals with all of this on her own, while dealing with his tantrums. \n\nHe better get his shit together before his wife divorces him and he loses custody of both of his children for being *at least* an emotionally abusive d-bag.", "I disagree. \n\nOf course, it's utopian to think that everyone would have or should be owed a healthy kid. This is the real world. He knows this, too. \n\nBut when you have a kid with difficulties and someone who's living a better life and has no such problems on a daily basis and comes to tell you that this is life and its no one's fault that you're suffering and that you shouldn't be OWED a healthy child. But ffs, who does op think she is ?! \n\nShe should be there to help him, not bring him down. He, in that situation, could only hear that he deserves what's happening to him because that's what's happens every day, and it's no one's fault. \n\nOp was really tactless, and if she wants to have a relationship of any type with bil, she should apologize and at least try to explain herself. But then, if she wants to keep being in her bubble of technically righltly used words, then it's her decision, I don't really care.", "He needs serious therapy over his \"karmic punishment\" child or whatever he thinks it is. I would hope he feels some form of shame for picking on his disabled classmates, but this toxic way of thinking he's \"owed\" a healthy child and why isn't his good enough is gonna be more detrimental to the poor kid. The family doesn't deserve this. Handling kids--healthy or not--is a HUGE undertaking. You don't need kids to see that. He needs to work out his feelings and depending on how he acts after, wife and kids may want to leave.\n\nI feel bad for everyone around him. BIL is the biggest a-hole.", "Well.. first of all I don't think you understood my comment *at all,* because I didn't actually say anything for you to agree or disagree with, I pointed out that you made a literal logical fallacy. \n\nThat's not an opinion or up for debate, it's a fact and it's there. Go look up Fallacy of the Inverse. \n\nI guess I did say that it's true no one is owed a healthy child. \n\nThat's also a fact and you actually seem to agree with that, as you say, it would be utopian (and therefore not realistic) to think everyone \"deserves\" to have healthy kids, when the truth is that any morality or karma or whatever kind of ethics system you want is just *not* a factor in what kind of kids you have. \n\nNo one \"deserves\" any kind of kid, that's not how genetics work. Life does not give a single shit about what anyone \"deserves\" it just happens. You seem to know that. \n\nIn any case you still seem to fail utterly to understand what OP *meant.* \n\nI don't really know how to explain it to you, since OP herself already has and you still don't get it, but her BIL is being a complete ass of a man and instead of manning the f up to accept his special needs son, he is verbally abusing literally everyone around him, including his poor wife and the therapists who try to help them. \n\nHe uses offensive language in regards to mental disabilities, has been a bully towards disabled people his entire life, and clearly is a bigoted, ableist asshole and for some reason you're defending him, saying OP should be there to help, not hinder. \n\nOP literally *is there to help* she was called there by her sister and she is trying her best, and instead she gets verbally abused by the asshole like everyone else, and when he *literally says* \"I deserve a healthy child and you don't\" OP points out that no, actually he doesn't. Because in your very own words \"that's what's happens every day, and it's no one's fault.\" \n\nIn *her* words \"You don't deserve a healthy child, *no one* is owed a healthy child.\" \n\nThe meaning is clear as fucking day, and she's right. The BIL is the one who is pushing the fucked up view that OP doesn't deserve a healthy kid, if you're going to be pissed, be pissed at him. \n\nSorry, but no, this guy does not get a free pass because \"oh poor him, his son is autistic and in diapers, it must be so hard for him, I'm sure he just misunderstood what OP said, so OP deserves to be yelled at and kicked out for trying to help.\" \n\nNo. \n\nAbsolutely not.", "I disagree about your logic. The fallacy of the inverse in this situation is not applied. That's why I don't agree with your reasoning. I'm not saying that the fallacy of the inverse is wrong, just that this is not a case to apply it to. \n\nI TOTALLY understand what op means. I don't need to get explained what she meant. \n\nBut it's like saying to a mom who has lost a kid because he drunk drived. It's his fault, he drunk and drove when he shouldn't have, and the mom should accept the consequences. But you don't say that to any fk one. You'd be saying it's sad that it happened, that toure there to help, you'd be showing them what they could do to go on. You don't tell them that they failed at educating their child better and that it's the kid's fault they're suffering. \nThe example is not perfect, but it's the closest one I could come up with. \n\nThe bil is already having it hard coming to ends with the situation, anyone would, and if you say that's not right, then you're living in disillusionment. He has always (wrongly !) Had a certain way of approaching such people. Op PERFECTLY knows that. She knows what type of person he is. She knows he's having difficulties in how he's trying to help the kid. He's probably yelling at doctors because he wrongly thinks that they're not doing enough. And his frustrations are wrongly being redirected to the wife, too. \n\nBut, despite how wrong he's reacting to this awful situation, op, knowing how he is, should not have \"tried to help\" how she did. \nWhat she did is not helping, AT ALL. She knows it too. Saying to him that life happens and that he should've expected that something couldve been wrong about his kid is not the way to help him have a new perspective of the situation or helping his wife either. It would only anger him, and that's what happened. \n\nThe only one who could've dared told him that he should get over his angst is someone who has a kid with needs too. If not his wife, then someone else in that situation. NOT OP ffs\n\nAnd anyway, I feel that no one who's not really living what the bil and sil are should be here saying that bil is an ah. People are all so good at judging until they are in that situation, too. He clearly also needs help to understand how to go on, PROFESSIONAL help, not a condescending ethical sentence from op that us not helping anyone."]}
