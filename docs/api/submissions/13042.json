This event is about his brother, Tom (32M) who was in my graduating class so I have known him longer than anyone else in the family.\n\nA little background on Tom, he was the class bully and is still a bit of a bully today. He used to make fun of kids in school who were \u201cdifferent\u201d or maybe had problems with learning and he not much has changed (think typical \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d toxic behavior).  We grew up in a pretty small town and Tom married Erika (31F) who was also in our class in school and was kind of mean to people as well.  For the record, I was never the target of their abuse.  Ultimately, when the three of us graduated, my BIL got into the family business, SIL attended a trade school and I left to join Jon in a large city for college.  We have remained in that city ever since.\n\nWe return to our hometown to visit our families and did so for a long weekend recently. Tom and Erika have 2 children, Allie (7F) and Matthew (5M). We have one child, Sam (4M). While I still find my BIL difficult to put up with, Erika has grown a lot and is a different person from who she was in high school.  The cousins do not see each other often so when we can get them together we try to do so and I really like Erika now.\n\nA few years ago, it became pretty clear that Matthew was not hitting his benchmarks.  I expressed my concern to Erika and suggested she seek some professional help so he can receive early intervention.  She agreed and my concern really just confirmed hers while my BIL kept making excuses.  After many months he was diagnosed with Autism.  He has been in therapies for the past few years but is still nonverbal and still in diapers.  This has become very distressing to my BIL and he is lashing out at doctors, therapists, and Erika.  My take is he knows how mean he was to kids like his son and now he is the parent of a disabled child.\n\nErika and I were talking and she asked if Jon would talk to Tom about how unproductive his behavior is and see if he would listen to his \u201cbig brother.\u201d I asked Jon to speak to him and he agreed. The next day, they were outside and Jon brought it up.  Tom immediately stormed off and came inside.  Erika asked what was wrong and Tom went off on her. I tried to calm him down and he started in on me and how I would never understand because my child is \u201chealthy.\u201d Then he said he was the one that deserves the \u201chealthy\u201d child since I\u2019m so okay with his son shitting in diapers at 5 years old.\n\nI said \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve a healthy child, no one is owed a healthy child.\u201d Well, this must have been the absolute worst thing to say because he kicked my family out and now I can't help but wonder if this comment really made me an AH.  My in-laws think he is overreacting, my husband is pissed at him and Erika has been secretly texting me and is really concerned about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I made this comment so I'll put it here too: the actual conversation was that my child isn't \"typical\" because I was owed or deserved a typical child and his child is not autistic because he was owed or deserved a disabled child.", "created_utc": 1679622042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12051fj/aita_for_telling_my_bil_he_doesnt_deserve_a/", "score": 356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like the best course now is to keep supporting her as she helps her husband come to terms. Fair or not, he's got a lot of grief and adjustment ahead of him, and he doesn't seem to have matured much over the years. Idk if you were way out of line or if he chose to hear it that way.

Erika needs to do what is best for her children & that may mean getting away from her husband's toxic behavior towards his children.\n\nI understand he's frustrated & probably exhausted from stress brought on by his son having autism, but he shouldn't be taking it out on everyone who is trying to help the son.\n\nNTA, and if I may suggest, you should try talking to Erika more & see where her head's at.

Your title implies that you meant he specifically doesn't deserve one, and in the context of explaining his past behavior, many people are concluding that you think you meant he deserves an unhealthy child as karma. When you said \"My take is he knows how mean he was and now his child is disabled\", some are interpreting that to mean you're saying your take is that is why he now has a disabled child, not why you think he is lashing out, which is what you really meant.\n\nImo, I actually think the opposite- everybody deserves a healthy child but only because every child deserves to be healthy, not because of the parents themselves. But I don't think what you said was wrong or bad. I think it doesn't really matter what you say, though, BIL is not in the right mental state to listen to anything he doesn't want to hear.

Her mom had a difficult time accepting the diagnosis but at the same time would use it to throw a pity party for herself.\n\nIncredibly long story short, she only got daughter into therapy/psych help because she started to become aggressive when the internet ( her comfort crutch) is not working. Sedation is the only way to calm her down and keep her calm till it\u2019s fixed. The specialist who examined her concluded that she could have been much more functional had she received consistent treatment early on in life.

It's important to remember that everyone is dealing with their own struggles and challenges, and it's important to approach them with empathy and understanding.", "ESH.

His reaction is completely understandable. \n\nOn top if that, his family decides to give him crap about his inability to cope rather than extending some grace in a horrible situation? \n\nI'm so glad my family didn't act like that when I was grieving my own child's diagnosis - especially when it was fresh. \n\nIt doesn't matter what he did before.

So Tom (understandably) reacted - it\u2019s very easy to say when it\u2019s not your hardship or mindset that needs to change.\n\nAnd throwing that BACK in his face with a pseudo-profound point was too much for him to take. Nobody deserves a healthy child? Yes, I understand how a logician could affirm that as a true statement. But *children* are innocent and *are* deserving of good health. As parents we will do anything to support them to be as healthy as they can be because they deserve it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole too, choosing to say something smart instead of showing your own humanity in a challenging moment as you so easily instructed Tom to do.", "YTA. \"You don't deserve a healthy child\" is unacceptable and toxic.

The shouting I had to endure while we were toilet training - took until 8 for consistent day time and 10 until night time.", "NTA, and as a father to an adult autistic son, also non-verbal and in diapers, I hope Erika gets away from that toxic bully for her son's sake as this is bound to get worse.", "Leaning YTA \n\nI get what you were trying to say, but you bungled it, it came across wrong, and it really wasn't the time.\n\nTom was also correct to basically tell you to shut the fuck up: he's right that you do not get to pretend this is all fine and wonderful and that Tom should be happy about it all when your kid is normal and healthy, and Tom's is not.\n\nI do think a small part of you DOES feel like this is karmic retribution and is giddy with glee the bully has to evolve. Which is ghoulish and unkind. Tom's reaction is a typical one many, many parents have upon the death of their dreams for their children. Your writing mini essays gathering scraps of evidence that this all ties back to him making fun of the weird kids in highschool is not helpful or needed, nor is presenting the false narrative that *you'd* be fine with a disabled child, so he should be as well.\n\nYou *do not* understand what Tom is feeling and unless you have another child who winds up significantly handicapped or your current child suffers a catastrophic injury leaving him permanently disabled and with diminished capacity, you *cannot* understand what Tom is feeling.\n\nI do think that if Tom doesn't get at least one person trying to be on his side (his brother and his parents are *annoyed* at him for going through this crisis. That is seriously fucked up. His wife has her own stuff to deal with and doesn't have the capacity) he will continue to degrade until he shatters and explodes in ways which cannot be undone and that will be very bad for all involved.", "Be there for your family, all of you need to protect them from the toxicity.", "Nta.", "NTA. Every day I see posts on here that remind me that I was really lucky to have disabled parents as a disabled kid because they didn\u2019t bring abled bs to the table when I was diagnosed.", "What are you asking here. \nI dont think your comment, as i read it , made to anyone, would have been out of line. To the prize that is your BIL, definitely not, since he sounds like someone who needs to be told how the world actually works.  \n\nYour BIL seems like  a shit by nature, is behaving badly, and lashing out in all directions. He is either going to be able to man up and actually put his son first, or he wont. None of that is on you, his wife, his son, the way of the world, the way he grew up, karma or anything else. Its just on him.\n\nNTA", "Karma is a bitch. I know most everyone wants a healthy child, what happens when that doesn't happen? I worked at a special needs job and its emotionally draining, so I get being around special needs people is a lot but they have their own way of communicating. Hopefully Erica talks to him, otherwise divorce bc he hasn't really changed since high school", "Giving you an award for how well you put it together\n\nNTA OP but you should continue to support Erika in any way you can and she needs keep the lines open", "If you\u2019re going to have a hard time accepting disabled kids you aren\u2019t ready for kids. It\u2019s not acceptable to have a hard time with a child\u2019s disability.", "I'm more worried that Tom will first try some of the horrific shit I've seen on the Internet that supposedly \"cures\" autism.", "Hey, I'm am autistic adult. Can you let Erika know that ABA style autistic \"therapy\" is not calling just abuse and causes PTSD, anxiety, suicide, and depression for a lot of autistic folks. It's not based on good science, but it's common because Autism Speaks and other eugenics organizations want to \"cure\" autistic folks like me and your nephew. They get big donations because they act like they're helping (they're not). \n\nI mention this because this parents who blame their child or try to make their child \"normal\" often gravitate towards this type of therapy. \n\nBtw, I've been married 15 years, have kids, work as a teacher, and am about to get my Masters. So we can succeed and thrive, but our lives just take different paths than allistic folks. Let Erika know that. \n\nFinally, autism is absolutely genetic, so there's a good chance one or both of Matthew's folks are on the spectrum. Maybe the dad was a bully because he had some autistic traits that his parents or siblings have him a hard time about and he used that insecurity he felt to bully other kids who were worse off than he was.\n\nI hope everything works out for the better. Your husband's brother's family definitely needs therapy, both individual and group.\n\nOh and yeah, your NTA.", "Um as someone on the spectrum I don't really like the sound of you or your brother ESH I guess?", "If you had only said 'no one is owed a healthy child', I would have been on your side but because you added, 'you don't deserve a healthy child' makes it sound like you don't think he does because of his past behavior. This is probably the way he took it and why you were kicked out. His problem is not only that his child is disabled but that he knows the child that he loves will end up being bullied the same way he had bullied many others and there isn't anything he can do to help him. The best thing anyone can do is get him into therapy or his self loathing will destroy his family. Tell Erica to stay strong.", "NTA\n\nYou're right. Nobody is owed a healthy child. He needs to accept the facts and give the child all it does need to grow and feel loved and accepted.", "NTA", "NTA. From the title and the start of the story I was ready to rip you a new one, because it sounded like you were mocking or accusing him that because he was a bully to \"different kids\" in school he deserves to have a different kid himself, like karma, sucks to be you haha.\n\nBut you weren't - and that's the point. You told him NO ONE is \"owed\" a healthy child. It's not like his shitty personality cosmically served him an autistic child.", "Sounds like karma hit Tom and he can't cope. NTA.", "NTA maybe change the title cause it sound like you are saying he deserves this because of his past behaviour.", "Nta....its kinda like he was given the chance to redeem his past qualities by showing compassion to his own child that he didn't have for others in the past. The fact he still doesn't acceptnit isn't ok.\n\nI know of someone who was like BIL ....she ended up with an autistic child and she is trying to do her best...needs a little improvement but she's getting there. \n\nI hope he can look past what he sees in his child and learn to love him anyways.", "NTA\n\nYour BIL has some really bad issues, and is treating his wife, and most likely his son like crap. The fact that your SIL needs to secretly text you shows that he's abusive and controlling as well.", "NTA. you're right, no one is owed a healthy child, it's not something you can 'deserve'", "ES\n\nTom always assumed his life would go as expected.  Having a child with these problems is something he personally can't cope with.  I don't think it has much to do with his actions as a child, beyond his judgement of people who weren't standard.  Accepting his son won't have the live he wanted for him, is difficult.  Acknowledging that he will never be released from this responsibility is HUGE.\n\nIn fairness, you don't know what he is experiencing.  You lead a different life .  Perhaps it is toxic masculinity but he might not have the tools to cope with this burden.  Every time he gets angry with the medical professionals - it is only way of expressing himself.  This must be scary for the people living with him.  The only people who should be offering him advice are parents who have been down this road ahead of him.\n\nWhen my brothers son was diagnosed, after 3 ordinary children, he had great trouble accepting what his wife and doctors were saying.", "NTA and who says the opposite hasn\u2019t read.

I think it's coming from a place of entitlement and ableism", "She definitely could've worded it better, but ultimately BIL is the one who has a problem with having an autistic child. He's not doing anything to come to terms with it and is instead just blowing up with anger at everyone involved. BIL is a grown man who can and should be taking responsibility for his own emotions, but instead he's behaving worse than his own child, throwing temper tantrums and acting out because the world hasn't given him what he feels he's owed. BIL is the worst kind of parent.", "Except many, many dads *don't* accept that. Unfortunately Tom isn't the only one here. The main difference here is that autism cannot really be diagnosed right after birth like some other disabilities. But many times women who give birth to disabled children leave hospitals as single moms. Because their husbands cannot deal with being a parent of a disabled child.", "I know they are like that but I don\u2019t think we should justify that attitude by acting like it\u2019s reasonable to have a hard time \u201caccepting\u201d your disabled child"]}
