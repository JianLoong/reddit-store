This event is about his brother, Tom (32M) who was in my graduating class so I have known him longer than anyone else in the family.\n\nA little background on Tom, he was the class bully and is still a bit of a bully today. He used to make fun of kids in school who were \u201cdifferent\u201d or maybe had problems with learning and he not much has changed (think typical \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d toxic behavior).  We grew up in a pretty small town and Tom married Erika (31F) who was also in our class in school and was kind of mean to people as well.  For the record, I was never the target of their abuse.  Ultimately, when the three of us graduated, my BIL got into the family business, SIL attended a trade school and I left to join Jon in a large city for college.  We have remained in that city ever since.\n\nWe return to our hometown to visit our families and did so for a long weekend recently. Tom and Erika have 2 children, Allie (7F) and Matthew (5M). We have one child, Sam (4M). While I still find my BIL difficult to put up with, Erika has grown a lot and is a different person from who she was in high school.  The cousins do not see each other often so when we can get them together we try to do so and I really like Erika now.\n\nA few years ago, it became pretty clear that Matthew was not hitting his benchmarks.  I expressed my concern to Erika and suggested she seek some professional help so he can receive early intervention.  She agreed and my concern really just confirmed hers while my BIL kept making excuses.  After many months he was diagnosed with Autism.  He has been in therapies for the past few years but is still nonverbal and still in diapers.  This has become very distressing to my BIL and he is lashing out at doctors, therapists, and Erika.  My take is he knows how mean he was to kids like his son and now he is the parent of a disabled child.\n\nErika and I were talking and she asked if Jon would talk to Tom about how unproductive his behavior is and see if he would listen to his \u201cbig brother.\u201d I asked Jon to speak to him and he agreed. The next day, they were outside and Jon brought it up.  Tom immediately stormed off and came inside.  Erika asked what was wrong and Tom went off on her. I tried to calm him down and he started in on me and how I would never understand because my child is \u201chealthy.\u201d Then he said he was the one that deserves the \u201chealthy\u201d child since I\u2019m so okay with his son shitting in diapers at 5 years old.\n\nI said \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve a healthy child, no one is owed a healthy child.\u201d Well, this must have been the absolute worst thing to say because he kicked my family out and now I can't help but wonder if this comment really made me an AH.  My in-laws think he is overreacting, my husband is pissed at him and Erika has been secretly texting me and is really concerned about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I made this comment so I'll put it here too: the actual conversation was that my child isn't \"typical\" because I was owed or deserved a typical child and his child is not autistic because he was owed or deserved a disabled child.", "created_utc": 1679622042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12051fj/aita_for_telling_my_bil_he_doesnt_deserve_a/", "score": 981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like the best course now is to keep supporting her as she helps her husband come to terms. Fair or not, he's got a lot of grief and adjustment ahead of him, and he doesn't seem to have matured much over the years. Idk if you were way out of line or if he chose to hear it that way.

Autistic children can be very high functioning & live relatively \"normal\" lives once they get the help & nurturing they need from EVERYONE in their lives.\n\nI see a divorce in your BIL's future if he doesn't change his ways. Erika needs to do what is best for her children & that may mean getting away from her husband's toxic behavior towards his children.\n\nI understand he's frustrated & probably exhausted from stress brought on by his son having autism, but he shouldn't be taking it out on everyone who is trying to help the son.\n\nNTA, and if I may suggest, you should try talking to Erika more & see where her head's at.

When you said \"My take is he knows how mean he was and now his child is disabled\", some are interpreting that to mean you're saying your take is that is why he now has a disabled child, not why you think he is lashing out, which is what you really meant.\n\nImo, I actually think the opposite- everybody deserves a healthy child but only because every child deserves to be healthy, not because of the parents themselves. But I don't think what you said was wrong or bad. I think it doesn't really matter what you say, though, BIL is not in the right mental state to listen to anything he doesn't want to hear. I hope he gets help before he does real damage to his family.", "NTA \n\nRegardless of his past history, your BIL needs help. For his son's sake, as well as his own.

Her mom had a difficult time accepting the diagnosis but at the same time would use it to throw a pity party for herself.\n\nIncredibly long story short, she only got daughter into therapy/psych help because she started to become aggressive when the internet ( her comfort crutch) is not working. Sedation is the only way to calm her down and keep her calm till it\u2019s fixed. The specialist who examined her concluded that she could have been much more functional had she received consistent treatment early on in life. Ultimately she functions like a 6-7 year old.  \n\nMy aunt passed away and left a major mess behind as no one can properly care for cousin, the two people in charge of her care and the worst options and Adult protective services doesn\u2019t care to even investigate.", "NTA.

You could have expressed your concerns or disagreements with his behavior in a more constructive and compassionate way.

It's important to remember that everyone is dealing with their own struggles and challenges, and it's important to approach them with empathy and understanding.", "ESH.

His reaction is completely understandable. \n\nOn top if that, his family decides to give him crap about his inability to cope rather than extending some grace in a horrible situation? \n\nI'm so glad my family didn't act like that when I was grieving my own child's diagnosis - especially when it was fresh. \n\nIt doesn't matter what he did before.

So Tom (understandably) reacted - it\u2019s very easy to say when it\u2019s not your hardship or mindset that needs to change.\n\nAnd throwing that BACK in his face with a pseudo-profound point was too much for him to take. Nobody deserves a healthy child? Yes, I understand how a logician could affirm that as a true statement. But *children* are innocent and *are* deserving of good health. As parents we will do anything to support them to be as healthy as they can be because they deserve it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole too, choosing to say something smart instead of showing your own humanity in a challenging moment as you so easily instructed Tom to do.", "YTA. \"You don't deserve a healthy child\" is unacceptable and toxic.

The life that you imagined for them.. it feels genuinely like something is taken from you. \n\nI'll restate this.  What Tom is going, it's not OK.  But having a disabled child is a kind of trauma and people react differently to traumas.  Tom needs help dealing with this, he's not OK, but getting angry at him and having a stupid argument like \"who disserves a healthy child\" is not going to resolve the issue. \n\nAlso something to note, divorce rates for parents of disabled children is astonishingly high. The levels of effort required, and that effort being a \"forever\" kind of thing, it breaks people.  I hope that Tom is able to get the help that he obviously needs.", "NTA, but slight Y T A for delivery. I know he was a bully, but I would have just said \"no one deserves a healthy child,\" and left it there. I'm pretty sure that Tom only heard the first part you said, and latched onto that to kick you out.\n\nPeople like him need someone to blame; barring that, someone to lash out at. He's probably going to twist your words and hold them over your head for as long as he can.", "By saying he deserve a \"healthy\" child he made himself the AH. How is a child with autism not HEALTHY? I know that they boy isn't neurotypical, but how can a parent be sooooo mean to his own son? He is acting like his son is less than, because he is on the spectrum. Like his son is worth less than your son. Nobody \"deserves\" a child. No matter if healthy, ill, neurotypical, neurodivergent.... Of course everyone wishes for the best life and future, but thats not how life works.\n\nIf i were SIL, i would kick Toms ass out on the street until he learns that he deserves no child at all. Tom should be happy that his son is healthy. That is what he IS. Healthy. He is not dying, nor in everyday pain. He is just not as typical as others.\n\nNTA for telling him how it is. Such an AH needs a bit of his own medicine, so he can think about his bullshit.", "NTA. You're right, no one is \"owed\" any sort of child, or children at all for that matter.", "NTA. \n\nYou have shown great compassion in your post and comments. Having a child comes with the risk of hardship around said child. That's just reality. Anyone suggesting otherwise is being willfully ignorant.", "NTA, however, as someone who has worked with many parent whose children have been diagnosed, I have to say dad's really do take it 6 with their sons. It is a grieving process, and yes, there is some anger involved and some denial. I get what you were trying to say, though. I wish I had some answers for you, but it's not easy. Unfortunately, this is a process that he is going to have to go through. The best you can do is listen and be there for him. Don't try to make a take of anything. I will also say not to assume this has anything to do with how he treated people in High school. I think your comment could have been worded better under the circumstances or I possibly I would have ignored it because your brother may have just been venting.", "NTA\n\nYour comment was clearly fair game bc he was suggesting something absurd, that having empathy and addressing his son's needs meant you are OK with it and since he ISNT, your kids should be the ones to have the issues. \n\nYou were just pointing out that deserving has nothing to do with anything.", "OP is absolutely NTA. My petty side wonders if someone should show BIL the articles about autism being passed paternally.", "NTA", "Nta you're just explaining science", "While you are not technically the AH here, I think you worded that badly. Not so much maybe for BIL, but you genuinely like Erika as you say and saying he does not deserve a healthy kid implys that neither does she.\n\nEvery kid deserves to be healthy, thus every parent deserves a healthy child. But nobody is owed a healthy child because. Simply because nobody is owed a kid.\n\nUnsure on the verdict on this one.", "I can see a lot of people on here are reading your comments in a couple of different ways. I\u2019m voting with the NTA group because I think you honestly meant it as \u2018this could happen to anyone, it\u2019s a fact of life sadly and there is no way that anyone gets a guarantee no matter what they do in life\u2019.\nOn to the BIL. He obviously has issues and prejudices that he is being forced to confront now. I may be wrong but I think he is going through the stages of grief/loss. The reason I say this is because I have been there. I was never a bully or any of that stuff but I developed a disability when I was in my late 20\u2019s. It changed my life and then meds used to treat it made me even worse. I was very ill for a while and when things levelled out I was not myself for a long time. I wish I had realised earlier as I could have done something about it sooner but I was going through these stages of loss/grief. I was mourning the life I thought I had and had been living and trying to accept a new reality. I got stuck around depression and as I say if I had realised earlier then I might have got past it sooner. It sounds like he is just getting past the denial stage and reaching anger. He is mourning the loss of the life he saw for his son and that can take a long time. He needs therapy but maybe if you guys can recognise the stages you can help him through since it doesn\u2019t sound like he would accept therapy would help. I hope he comes to terms with it soon.", "I totally thought you were going to throw it in his face as karma because he bullied children who were different, but you actually went in the opposite direction from what I was thinking.\n\nI was leaning towards YTA but you're right, no one deserves, is owed, or is entitled to a healthy child. Your job as a parent is to love your child and you don't get to choose your kid, just like kids don't get to choose their parents.\n\nI'm autistic and I know it caused difficulties for my parents and if they had the choice, they probably would have chosen a kid that wasn't autistic. It's sad but it's a truth for a lot of people.\n\nLogistically, children with learning disabilities and mental handicaps are more difficult than children without those same disabilities. It sounds mean but it's a fact. I am somewhat lucky in that yes, I'm autistic but I'm high functioning, whereas it sounds like your nephew is low or mid-functioning and will need a great deal of support in his life. That takes a lot from a family, it's difficult, it's expensive, it's time-consuming, it's logistically challenging. It is valid for your brother-in-law and sister-in-law to feel frustrated by the situation. Most parents do.\n\nHowever, BIL is wrong believing that he's entitled to a healthy kid. That's the risk you take when you conceive a child and everyone takes that risk. And he doesn't get to love his kid any less than he loves his other kids just because one of his children was born with a disability. He needs to step up as a parent and be there 100% for all of his kids. He didn't choose for his son to have a disability, but his son also didn't choose to have a disability. No one chose this, it's just how it worked out and now BIL has to deal with it.", "NTA and Tom is in desperate need of therapy. His world view is completely wrong.\nTalking about \"deserving\"  children to be a certain way... ugh. Where did he get the idea that health and strength are some karmic reward? He's obviously held this view since his teens.", "Also how I heard it.  NTA, OP.  I think you hit a double nerve on 1.  his child, and, 2. in general, BIL seems like the type to think he's \"owed\" a lot by the world and doesn't want to be told otherwise.  I'm glad SIL is stepping up, keep supporting her, you're doing the right thing.", "I think some people are seeing it like it's a karma thing. \n\nLike bil was an absolute ah to others in school, especially those with disabilities and now he's got a kid with disabilities. Karma just took a big bite out of him. \n\nBut theirs no explanation for autism, it just happens and it's because some was good or bad. \n\nI think op just wanted him to stop and accept that we all as parents want a healthy kid, but for whatever reason some come out needing more help. It's not as horrible as bil is making it out. \n\nMaybe it's karma, maybe it's not. But I agree, it's ironic that bully ends up having a child with a disability. \n\nThis situation will likely end up with the bil running away from the family and son, and only caring about the two kids who are \"healthy\". That poor kid will grow up without a father or one who doesn't love him. \n\nIf he's blowing up at everyone, then he blames everyone for the way his son is. He will leave because he didn't get the perfect family he wanted.", "Since you\u2019re top comment you might want to add your judgment", "If anything, this seems a bit like the universe trying to make him take a good long look in the mirror. But he hasn't really grown up and is squeezing his eyes closed to avoid doing so. He needs to check himself or he's going to be losing everything.", "He probably would bully disabled people as an adult too. He definitely gives off that kind of vibe from what I read.", "OTOH, not all autistic people will be high functioning in the sense of being employable and living independently. That doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t have a good and happy life. I have a child who will always need support, but I love her and will do what I can to give her a life she enjoys. \n\nSome parents need to re-think what their child\u2019s life will be and get behind the child they have, not the child they expected.", "Yup, I see a lot of parents trying to parent the kid they wanted instead of the one they had. Neither of mine are anything like I imagined years ago before having children, but half the fun is learning who they are and what makes them tick, and I wouldn't change them for the world. Parenting a neurodivergent child is definitely a challenge (both my kids are in different ways) but no one is owed a \"typical\" child.", "everybody deserves a heathy child, but like isn't like that", "I love the picture idea! What a great kid.", "She does. We are in constant contact. We don\u2019t have a ton of extra space because we live in a high cost of living city but we have a spare room if she needs to bring the kids and stay for a bit.", "It is truly very hard on Erika which is why she wanted my husband to talk to him. They have had several therapists quit on them because my BIL is so aggressive with them. It\u2019s a small town and they now have to travel further for some of these interventions which also makes it harder on them.", "I never said he deserves a child with medical issues, I never said he deserves a child without medical issues, I used his language which os why the word is in quotes.", "I do not believe he is being punished for his sins because I do not see my nephew as a punishment.  I think my BIL does see Matthew as his punishment. I know he is not my child but if it were my son, I would not be an obstacle to him getting help which is what my BIL is at this point. This is not my opinion but his wife\u2019s feelings. She is very frustrated and has had more than one therapist quit because of BIL\u2019s actions.", "Sorry about that. Went to bed with 34 upvotes and woke up to 1.9k. Wasn\u2019t expecting that haha", "But I didn't say that \"all\" autistic children, i said \"autistic children CAN be\".", "Obviously not. But the situation is karmic.", "Okay, thank you for clarifying", "\"Deserving\" a healthy child doesn't mean exchanging your kid once they show sign of problems. \n\nYou should want everyone to be healthy because saying someone doesn't deserve a healthy kid means you want a future person to suffer. Every child should be healthy, and sadly, this is not the case, but saying everyone deserves a healthy kid, despite how utopian it is, is not wrong", "That poor child's mom needs to start making an escape plan for when BIL's tantrums turn to abuse towards his son, or towards his wife for birthing the child. It's hard enough raising a special needs child with the partner's support, but when the partner refuses to accept reality or their child's limitations, it's got to be the loneliest existence for the mom.", "No.", "Agreed. Brother-in-law has a bad case of the \"just world fallacy\", and he needs to get it through his head that that isn't the way the world works. And if he can't/won't do that, then his wife needs to get the kids away from his delusional influence, because it's going to cause emotional abuse at bare minimum.", "It might be for the best, at least the kid will have a loving mother, uncle and auntie.", "You really suck. \n\nHaving a good view over people with needs or not doesn't mean it's the same as having your own kid that needs constant help. \n\nYes, for him, it would've been better if he had not bullied other kids that were suffering, but  it doesn't mean he would've taken it better had he not been a bully. \n\nLet's be honest, op wouldn't have said those words if he had been a perfect person growing up. She would've only emphasized with him in that case. And that makes her an ah", "I don\u2019t care what you say about me. Kiss off. \n\nThe brother had literally a lifetime to get his act together before he had kids. He chose to stay in the same crappy mentality. \n\nEdited for misspelling.", "Thinking a kid is not wrong for having problems is not the same as having your own child at home with so many more responsibilities on you.\n\nHaving a good perspective on someone else is not the same as experiencing it yourself. \n\nIt's like saying to someone who has cancer that he'll get over it and that after chemo, he'll return the same as before and then experiencing it first hand. IT'S NOT THE SAME. \n\nI also understand what op meant, but to someone who's suffering, that's not how you'd interpret it. She should've used better words, and despite her good intentions, she sucked", "You can keep on keeping on. You don\u2019t want a conversation. You just want a confrontation. \n\nEdited for autocorrect.", "Yeah, I guess for you, me replying to you is just having a confrontation and wanting to argue.\nIt's never about trying to understand other's views. \n\nYeah, it's better not to keep on wasting my time. Bye", "Take care. Have a good day."]}
