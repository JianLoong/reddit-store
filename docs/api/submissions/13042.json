This event is about his brother, Tom (32M) who was in my graduating class so I have known him longer than anyone else in the family.\n\nA little background on Tom, he was the class bully and is still a bit of a bully today. He used to make fun of kids in school who were \u201cdifferent\u201d or maybe had problems with learning and he not much has changed (think typical \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d toxic behavior).  We grew up in a pretty small town and Tom married Erika (31F) who was also in our class in school and was kind of mean to people as well.  For the record, I was never the target of their abuse.  Ultimately, when the three of us graduated, my BIL got into the family business, SIL attended a trade school and I left to join Jon in a large city for college.  We have remained in that city ever since.\n\nWe return to our hometown to visit our families and did so for a long weekend recently. Tom and Erika have 2 children, Allie (7F) and Matthew (5M). We have one child, Sam (4M). While I still find my BIL difficult to put up with, Erika has grown a lot and is a different person from who she was in high school.  The cousins do not see each other often so when we can get them together we try to do so and I really like Erika now.\n\nA few years ago, it became pretty clear that Matthew was not hitting his benchmarks.  I expressed my concern to Erika and suggested she seek some professional help so he can receive early intervention.  She agreed and my concern really just confirmed hers while my BIL kept making excuses.  After many months he was diagnosed with Autism.  He has been in therapies for the past few years but is still nonverbal and still in diapers.  This has become very distressing to my BIL and he is lashing out at doctors, therapists, and Erika.  My take is he knows how mean he was to kids like his son and now he is the parent of a disabled child.\n\nErika and I were talking and she asked if Jon would talk to Tom about how unproductive his behavior is and see if he would listen to his \u201cbig brother.\u201d I asked Jon to speak to him and he agreed. The next day, they were outside and Jon brought it up.  Tom immediately stormed off and came inside.  Erika asked what was wrong and Tom went off on her. I tried to calm him down and he started in on me and how I would never understand because my child is \u201chealthy.\u201d Then he said he was the one that deserves the \u201chealthy\u201d child since I\u2019m so okay with his son shitting in diapers at 5 years old.\n\nI said \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve a healthy child, no one is owed a healthy child.\u201d Well, this must have been the absolute worst thing to say because he kicked my family out and now I can't help but wonder if this comment really made me an AH.  My in-laws think he is overreacting, my husband is pissed at him and Erika has been secretly texting me and is really concerned about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I made this comment so I'll put it here too: the actual conversation was that my child isn't \"typical\" because I was owed or deserved a typical child and his child is not autistic because he was owed or deserved a disabled child.", "created_utc": 1679622042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12051fj/aita_for_telling_my_bil_he_doesnt_deserve_a/", "score": 615, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like the best course now is to keep supporting her as she helps her husband come to terms. Fair or not, he's got a lot of grief and adjustment ahead of him, and he doesn't seem to have matured much over the years. Idk if you were way out of line or if he chose to hear it that way.

Erika needs to do what is best for her children & that may mean getting away from her husband's toxic behavior towards his children.\n\nI understand he's frustrated & probably exhausted from stress brought on by his son having autism, but he shouldn't be taking it out on everyone who is trying to help the son.\n\nNTA, and if I may suggest, you should try talking to Erika more & see where her head's at.

Your title implies that you meant he specifically doesn't deserve one, and in the context of explaining his past behavior, many people are concluding that you think you meant he deserves an unhealthy child as karma. When you said \"My take is he knows how mean he was and now his child is disabled\", some are interpreting that to mean you're saying your take is that is why he now has a disabled child, not why you think he is lashing out, which is what you really meant.\n\nImo, I actually think the opposite- everybody deserves a healthy child but only because every child deserves to be healthy, not because of the parents themselves. But I don't think what you said was wrong or bad. I think it doesn't really matter what you say, though, BIL is not in the right mental state to listen to anything he doesn't want to hear.

Her mom had a difficult time accepting the diagnosis but at the same time would use it to throw a pity party for herself.\n\nIncredibly long story short, she only got daughter into therapy/psych help because she started to become aggressive when the internet ( her comfort crutch) is not working. Sedation is the only way to calm her down and keep her calm till it\u2019s fixed. The specialist who examined her concluded that she could have been much more functional had she received consistent treatment early on in life. Ultimately she functions like a 6-7 year old.  \n\nMy aunt passed away and left a major mess behind as no one can properly care for cousin, the two people in charge of her care and the worst options and Adult protective services doesn\u2019t care to even investigate.", "NTA.

It's important to remember that everyone is dealing with their own struggles and challenges, and it's important to approach them with empathy and understanding.", "ESH.

His reaction is completely understandable. \n\nOn top if that, his family decides to give him crap about his inability to cope rather than extending some grace in a horrible situation? \n\nI'm so glad my family didn't act like that when I was grieving my own child's diagnosis - especially when it was fresh. \n\nIt doesn't matter what he did before.

So Tom (understandably) reacted - it\u2019s very easy to say when it\u2019s not your hardship or mindset that needs to change.\n\nAnd throwing that BACK in his face with a pseudo-profound point was too much for him to take. Nobody deserves a healthy child? Yes, I understand how a logician could affirm that as a true statement. But *children* are innocent and *are* deserving of good health. As parents we will do anything to support them to be as healthy as they can be because they deserve it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole too, choosing to say something smart instead of showing your own humanity in a challenging moment as you so easily instructed Tom to do.", "YTA. \"You don't deserve a healthy child\" is unacceptable and toxic.
