We've been together over a year, and he has travelled a lot and loves it.  This is my first long trip, and my first international travel, I am definitely a homebody so I am not enjoying quite as easily but still like seeing the vastly different country. \n\nContext - I have explained multiple times to my bf on this trip that while I appreciate and like meeting his friends and family, the language barrier does make it a little boring for me after a while as I cannot contribute to the conversation and after the first few polite sentences I am essentially ignored and I get socially drained and tired very easily (if I were at home I'd politely excuse myself and walk home but this is not possible here).\n\nStory - so we are out for dinner with his family, and first time for me meeting his brothers recent fiance. His brother speaks english and we make polite chitchat for 10mins or so. The dinner was planned for a time well past my usual dinner time, in fact I'm an early bird so past my bedtime even. I have already been quite tired all day and tried to recharge my energy by reading by myself most the day. After the initial chitchat in english, they continue on in their language with my partner once and a while translating the sentence but only if I ask what theyre talking about, otherwise I sit there in silence and no one tries to engage me in conversation or even acknowledges me. I know this is not done to be rude, and I accept that, but it does get a bit boring and hard to distract myself from how increasingly tired I feel. The dinner comes to a close after nearly 2 hours and I can barely keep my eyes open and have nearly fallen asleep. Then they get up to take a photo and I politely decline mostly because I am tired but also because I have put on weight the past year and am extremely self conscious about it (I've taken no full body shots this whole trip because I do not want photo evidence of my body during this time). My boyfriend and his mother try to convince me to get up and I ask to please have the photo taken without me (I've never been interested in having my photo taken anyway).\nThey take the photo and then my boyfriend says \"thanks my mum is crying now because of you\". It's super awkward and everyone guides her out of the restaurant giving her hugs etc. I'm barely conscious at this point and stumble to the car and have a nap on the way home. Immediately go to bed and have just woken up so haven't had a chance to speak to anyone. \nI understand a photo is not a huge deal and I could have done it to make them happy, but I've also never been someone to do something just \"to be polite\" I've always done what I wanted and I did not want my photo taken. \n\nAm I the asshole for my boyfriend's mother crying cos I didn't want a photo taken with the family?", "created_utc": 1674660326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l16m8/aita_for_not_having_my_photo_taken_at_dinner_and/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't hurt to be polite sometimes.", "Sorry, but I believe YTA. \n\nYes there is a bit of an overreaction from your boyfriend\u2019s mum and subsequently him but, your attitude throughout this post stinks.

OP, I think if you felt that strongly about having your picture taken you should have talked to your BF about it beforehand and came up with a plan since it\u2019s predictable they\u2019d want to take some pics.

Why don't you eat something before the dinner to tie you over, why don't you speak any of the language of the country you have traveled in for a year with a native speaker?

But he's always been more worried about how I will appear to his family with the cultural differences rather than how I feel and I think that's the main issue here. \nYes the line of \"I do want I want\" is extremely pigheaded and I know this. I have never really given a fuck what people think of me and it vibes with some and not with others. \nEveryone's advice on learning the language and trying to make mor of an effort with the family has been taken very seriously, I understand now after speaking to my bf and reading some comments that I should change my attitude and be grateful that they care enough to want me here. \nI will try talk to my boyfriend again when he's calmer, and sit down with his family and apologise and try reach some kind of understanding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know a little of the language and customs, he has explained to me. But I guess in this instance I was far too stubborn for something that wasn't important to me but was to them.
