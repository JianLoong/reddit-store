The reason she cried was because she thought she had upset me, not because she was manipulative - she is extremely lovely and expressed sadness that I didn't feel part of the family. My boyfriend and I had a lengthy discussion and I find it funny the judgements on our relationship, we are a lot stronger than some of you think. But I agree, I was the AH in this circumstance and a lot of your comments changed my perspective and really helped the reality check. Thank you for all the kind words and understanding \u2764\ufe0f\n\nOkay back story - my partner and I are currently travelling his home country. We've been together over a year, and he has travelled a lot and loves it.  This is my first long trip, and my first international travel, I am definitely a homebody so I am not enjoying quite as easily but still like seeing the vastly different country. \n\nContext - I have explained multiple times to my bf on this trip that while I appreciate and like meeting his friends and family, the language barrier does make it a little boring for me after a while as I cannot contribute to the conversation and after the first few polite sentences I am essentially ignored and I get socially drained and tired very easily (if I were at home I'd politely excuse myself and walk home but this is not possible here).\n\nStory - so we are out for dinner with his family, and first time for me meeting his brothers recent fiance. His brother speaks english and we make polite chitchat for 10mins or so. The dinner was planned for a time well past my usual dinner time, in fact I'm an early bird so past my bedtime even. I have already been quite tired all day and tried to recharge my energy by reading by myself most the day. After the initial chitchat in english, they continue on in their language with my partner once and a while translating the sentence but only if I ask what theyre talking about, otherwise I sit there in silence and no one tries to engage me in conversation or even acknowledges me. I know this is not done to be rude, and I accept that, but it does get a bit boring and hard to distract myself from how increasingly tired I feel. The dinner comes to a close after nearly 2 hours and I can barely keep my eyes open and have nearly fallen asleep. Then they get up to take a photo and I politely decline mostly because I am tired but also because I have put on weight the past year and am extremely self conscious about it (I've taken no full body shots this whole trip because I do not want photo evidence of my body during this time). My boyfriend and his mother try to convince me to get up and I ask to please have the photo taken without me (I've never been interested in having my photo taken anyway).\nThey take the photo and then my boyfriend says \"thanks my mum is crying now because of you\". It's super awkward and everyone guides her out of the restaurant giving her hugs etc. I'm barely conscious at this point and stumble to the car and have a nap on the way home. Immediately go to bed and have just woken up so haven't had a chance to speak to anyone. \nI understand a photo is not a huge deal and I could have done it to make them happy, but I've also never been someone to do something just \"to be polite\" I've always done what I wanted and I did not want my photo taken. \n\nAm I the asshole for my boyfriend's mother crying cos I didn't want a photo taken with the family?", "created_utc": 1674660326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l16m8/aita_for_not_having_my_photo_taken_at_dinner_and/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't hurt to be polite sometimes.", "Sorry, but I believe YTA. \n\nYes there is a bit of an overreaction from your boyfriend\u2019s mum and subsequently him but, your attitude throughout this post stinks.

OP, I'm sure u dont mean u act without regards towards others with \"I've also never been someone to do something just \"to be polite\" I've always done what I wanted and I did not want my photo taken.\"-- just that you wont be pressured/bullied into doing or part taking in something just because it's the social expectation or what is \"polite\".\n\nThe times I've gone along or said yes because of politeness..... my etiquette teacher said \"the end goal is a pleasant social interaction\"  meaning if someone is impolite or commits a fuax pas the mannered thing is to carry on pleasantly without calling them out and making it awkward/uncomfortable.....whether or not the person was \"wrong\", especially since we may not have all the info or understanding.

OP, I think if you felt that strongly about having your picture taken you should have talked to your BF about it beforehand and came up with a plan since it\u2019s predictable they\u2019d want to take some pics.

To me that\u2019s a red flag for how things will be if you marry into that family.", "I am going with ESH. Your boyfriend's reaction, and his mother's reaction, were both pretty disproportionate. However, being in a group photo really isn't a big ask. You don't have to do it, but other people are perfectly valid in thinking you are rude for saying no.

You don't do things you don't want to and you don't do things to be polite, seriously, that alone makes you an asshole.\nIf this trip is not working out for you, then why do you stay, why do you go to the dinners? Why don't you eat something before the dinner to tie you over, why don't you speak any of the language of the country you have traveled in for a year with a native speaker? Why do you care about taking a photo. Taking the picture would have been much quicker than dealing with the drama. \n\nSo many things you could have done differently, yet you choose the one thing that upset your bfs mom.

But he's always been more worried about how I will appear to his family with the cultural differences rather than how I feel and I think that's the main issue here. \nYes the line of \"I do want I want\" is extremely pigheaded and I know this. I have never really given a fuck what people think of me and it vibes with some and not with others. \nEveryone's advice on learning the language and trying to make mor of an effort with the family has been taken very seriously, I understand now after speaking to my bf and reading some comments that I should change my attitude and be grateful that they care enough to want me here. \nI will try talk to my boyfriend again when he's calmer, and sit down with his family and apologise and try reach some kind of understanding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand exactly how it feels to be in a situation where you don't speak the language, and where it feels like no one even knows/cares that you're there, so you're left out. I'm also an introvert, so I understand exactly how it feels to be in a social situation that you don't want to be in while tired and with no escape. I don't think you're an asshole for experiencing these things, but something that I've learned how to do is excusing myself to take walks outside or around the area when I'm in those situations. That way, I can recharge a bit on my own before coming back. We're not always going to be in situations that we like to be in, so I think learning how to manage and take care of yourself within them is really important. \n\nI also think that investing in learning your partner's language will help you a lot. Think about it from his family's perspective: If you can't speak to them, they can't speak to you either. They probably want to include you, but they have no idea what to say to you, the same way that you don't know what to say to them. Even if you just know a few words or sentences, hearing you say them will probably open them up a LOT to you. Introverted or not, it's not everyone's job to engage with you, on your terms. You have to be willing to initiate sometimes too, even if it feels uncomfortable or scary given the language barrier. If your partner is someone that you deeply care about and can see yourself with long-term, it will do you good to learn how to speak to his family.", "YTA.

Your bf brought a woman home to meet the family, a sign that things are getting serious, so for your bf's mum this is a big deal. She probably approaches this as meeting her future DIL, and furthermore probably doesn't see her son often if he has to fly home to see her.   \n\n\nThis isn't just a photo, it's about the memories of a trip that probably hasn't been what either of you wanted it to be. I lived out of the country for about 8 years, and let me tell you that for your family, any visit is a big deal in that situation. She was probably very excited to meet her son's gf, but then saw you taking space for yourself, away from the group, bored and falling asleep at dinner and then refusing to join in the photo that she will likely hold as a treasured memory of her son's visit. She is probably very disappointed, feeling like she has been insulted and like she has failed as a host.\n\nYour reasons for not wanting to take a photo make sense in any context but this one. It wasn't a night out with some friends, or a work function, it was family gethering, a family that doesn't all get to be together often.

I doubt her refusal to be in the photo was the only ting made the mothe cry. I've been on both sides of this situation, the one not speaking the language, and being the translator for people who didn't speak my language. When there's a language barrier, you go off the behaviour and reactions of the non speaker and if they don't seem interested or engaged, people are only going to try just so many times before giving up.  Fact is, OP is a guest in a foreign country, and a guest of the bf's family.
