May want to talk to them...", "Umm\u2026 I need some ages on this", "NTA and I think it's sweet you have a good relationship with her...\n\nBut I think I would have checked with the partner first or just mentioned it.", "NTA. Sleeping on the sofa is a no go for me", "> She claimed I should have asked for her permission first. \n\nYou've not said how old the daughter is, which absolutely dictates whether you should have asked permission first, but you said you \"had a few drinks\" so I'm assuming the daughter is an adult, so NTA.", "NTA. Your GF\u2019s jealousy of her own daughter should be a giant red flag.", "NTA in any way shape or form", "She wasn't going. Her daughter had a great idea & you 2 got to know each other a bit. I don't understand why she was angry.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Daughter is 19. A legal adult. And I assume of legal drinking age since they were in a restaurant. Mom should be glad you guys have a good relationship.", "NTA, at all. Is your fianc\u00e9 jealous?", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t have slept on the couch. Apparently you don\u2019t matter. Rethink that relationship.", "INFO: I feel like we know what happened, but not how it happened. \n\nWas this restaurant one that she picked? What was the conversation that happened when she went in to work? (Sometimes you don\u2019t literally have to go in, but you have to to stay in the good graces of a boss.) Did you value going to the restaurant more than going with her? Did you essentially take her daughter on a date? What is the conversion that happened between finac\u00e9e and daughter? Do you have a fatherly relationship with her daughter? Is your fianc\u00e9e insecure, and if so, don\u2019t you think this would make her feel moreso? What do you think a good partner would do in this scenario?\n\nLeaning toward E S H.", "I\u2019m curious about the ages of everyone. And curious why the ages weren\u2019t posted.\n\nEdit:I just saw that the op posted their ages. Daughter is 19 and he is 32 it\u2019s a little weird to take your soon to be 19yr step daughter to dinner alone. A dinner that was suppose to be a romantic date for op and the mom. I don\u2019t know if they were both drinking, in Canada it\u2019s legal to drink at 19", "The shift was her choice and she opted out, not OP. Why not use the reservation? What I can not understand is why the women always get the bed? My husband told me in the beginning of our marriage he would never sleep on the couch, because it is his bed too. Made sense to me, it's not like you are fighting while sleeping and going to bed angry is just fine. Many times sleep reduces the high emotions and talking it out is easier.", "So he can't spend time with his future step daughter?", "What? It's his future step daughter", "Seems like your SO is probably a bit older than you. Nothing wrong with that but I\u2019m curious how old she is?? \n\nI think she\u2019s being ridiculous but have you thought that maybe the jealousy is coming from her own insecurity about any kind of age gap? Seems like she was looking at your nice bonding time with her daughter in a more sinister way tbh.", "Has she shown any jealousy other than this one incident?", "Sure, but maybe not in a fancy restaurant where he usually goes on dates with her mom.", "A person can indeed spend time with a future step daughter. \n\nOP sounds like he might be accepting auditions for the role of backup wife.", "\u201cHey, I\u2019m going out to that fancy restaurant for dinner and drinks with your 19 year old daughter\u201d\n\nSounds courteous enough for me", "She is quite jealous", "But it\u2019s also not unreasonable to not want your 19 year old daughter and your 32 year old fianc\u00e9 out having dinner and drinks at a fancy, romantic restaurant. Like, even if you can trust both of them, there\u2019s no reason for them to be in a tempting situation.", "What gives you that idea?", "Some women react like this for no reason often. Some people are reasonable and some are not.", "I'd love to see your definition of normal people...", "If your fianc\u00e9e is jealous of you spending time with her daughter, that\u2019s a red flag because it speaks volumes about her opinion of you as a trustworthy partner.
