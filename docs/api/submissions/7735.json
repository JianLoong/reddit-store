I was going to cancel the reservation after she went to work but her daughter said that we should just go together. She could probably tell I was really bummed about having to cancel. Anyway we went to dinner and had a few drinks. I genuinely had a really nice time. When my SO got home from work at 11pm I told her that I went with her daughter but she didn't take it well and it turned into a huge fight. She claimed I should have asked for her permission first. I told her that I was a grown ass man and I didn't need to ask anyone for permission.
