Being said I know how to deal with them a bit better now but with the stress of a full-time job and being a full-time student my migraines have turned into cluster headaches and even sent me to the ER twice in the past year. My husband (26m) and I got married a year and a half ago and it has been rocky but we\u2019ve been going to therapy and doing alright lately. \n\nI came home with a migraine I got during work and by the time I got home I barely wanted to open my eyes. I soaked my feet in hot water and put ice packs on my neck to relieve the pain but to no avail. At around 3 am that morning me and my husband are sleeping and I wake up to a stabbing pain behind my eye. I\u2019ve only had it one other time and It gets so bad my face swells up. I took the migraine pills beside my bed and tried to breathe it out. An hour past and I feel my face swelling and I feel nauseated from the pain so I decide to ask if he can make me coffee since sometimes caffeine helps me. I figured it was between that or asking him to drive me to the ER but thought I would exhaust all my options first. (Just a side note I had work at 6 am and he has been off all week so i was not waking him up when he had work the next day)\n\nHe got upset and stormed downstairs and started slamming stuff around which was just making my head feel worse. I decided to blindly walk downstairs to tell him that I would try to make it myself and to go back to bed only to see the water kettle on and him asleep on the couch. This upset me because although I\u2019ve always been more nurturing between the two of us (I work in healthcare), I always drop whatever I\u2019m doing when he is sick, hurt or even stressed to make sure he is okay and do what I can to help him relax. I told him to go upstairs and he said that I was extremely rude for waking him up. I tried to explain that I only asked him because I\u2019m in a lot of pain and I cant see very well and he just said its \u201cjust a headache and it doesn\u2019t hurt enough that I can still yell at him\u201d. I told him to go upstairs and I just tried to make my coffee in the dark and sip on it. I texted him apologizing for the angry choice of words I used but said that his lack of empathy concerns me, especially because that\u2019s what a partner is for. Someone to help in sickness and in health. He said I was being toxic and selfish and that he\u2019s never woken me up to ask for anything. I let it go and when I got to work I texted him around 9 am and asked if he was awake. He said yes and I asked if he would read through what he sent me just hoping it was him being grumpy and sleepy and he just said \u201ci know what I said and I stand by it\u201d I just didn\u2019t  respond and went to the ER for steroids for my migraine. I\u2019m over talking about it with him because it honestly just makes me upset to see how uncaring he can be but I like reading AITA post and thought.\n\nTIA\n\nAlso to mention I have free health care and where I live there is no urgent care or clinic. Just hospital and ER to get medication/treatment.\n\n** Also I say yelled but I didn\u2019t yell at him I just told him to go back upstairs**", "created_utc": 1695726967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16skycy/aita_for_waking_my_husband_up_at_3_am_to_make_me/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anyone voting y-t-a doesn\u2019t understand the debilitating pain of migraines and cluster headaches. My mum says them and she says sometimes it\u2019s worse than childbirth. It doesn\u2019t seem like you wake him up often, but if you do then that would be an e-s-h. Your husband\u2019s behaviour slamming things around is really childish and I would reconsider someone who minimised my pain the way he minimised yours", "As someone who has had chronic migraines before, I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NTA. Migraines are not just simply \u2018headaches\u2019. When I get them, I quite literally cannot move from the spot that I chose to lay in or else I will black out from the pain, puke, or get so dizzy I will hurt myself. \nPersonally too, from this experience, if my partner woke me up at 3am, even on a work day, I would not be mad. Maybe slightly annoyed, but never genuinely mad.", "I would get up for my wife at that time if she asked me to. If your truly special to him then he should treat you like gold. I try to do whatever I can to show my wife she is special no matter the circumstances.", "INFO: if you know caffeine helps, why not just have a caffeine tablet or one of those cans of cold coffee ready to go by the side of your bed?", "The amount of people here who have clearly never dealt with migraines\u2026 I have had a partner have cluster headaches, and I\u2019d have dropped everything regardless of the time. \n\nI get that it\u2019s annoying being woken up, but there are other priorities sometimes? I don\u2019t think this is out of the realm of requests. I\u2019ve had to send my partner to my mums for pills at 3am before, and he did it because he knew I wouldn\u2019t ask if I didn\u2019t need it.\n\nNTA. I get your husband is irritated and tired but he\u2019s being selfish imo.", "NTA. I occasionally wake up my husband for comfort when I have a terrible nightmare and can\u2019t shake it. If he\u2019s sick or has a nightmare (yes we both have occasional awful nightmares and it sucks), I make sure he has what he needs before I go back to sleep. I have *never* been angry that he woke me up. We\u2019ve been together 11 years, married for 4.\n\nYou all responding to this post act like being woken up at 3am is the equivalent of torture. Yes, OP could have kept coffee by her bed but I would imagine drinking caffeine at 3am is probably a last resort and not something you would be prepared for *every night*. \n\nThere could be more to the story that led to OP\u2019s partner reacting this way, but this reaction as an isolated incident is childish. How is he going to act if you decide to have children together? What if you have a migraine and he refuses to take care of the baby because \u201cit\u2019s your turn\u201d? \n\nKeep going to couples therapy. I wish you all the best, OP", "NTA. You got sick.  He got mad at you for wanting help while you were sick. \n\nI feel like a lot of the Y T As are from people who've never had a migraine and think it's just a headache. I've had more than my fair share and they suck balls. Sometimes whatever worked last time doesn't work this time and you just throw anything you can think of at it.  Having a partner who can help even if you could technically do it yourself is part of what having/being a partner is all about.\n\nI also feel like a lot of the Y T As are from people who've never had a partner who's gotten ill in the middle of the night and needed help with something. My spouse and I have traded off caring for each other when middle of the night sickness hits.  Does it suck for the person who isn't sick? Yeah, but that's part of the whole \"in sickness and in health\" thing. \n\nPeople who aren't ready to occasionally have their sleep interrupted to care for a sick person, shouldn't move in with their significant other, get married, or have kids.", "As someone who has dealt with migraines in the past, NTA. But I get not wanting to be woke up in the middle of the night. \nHowever, I will say, if I asked my husband to make me coffee in the middle of the night, he would. Because your spouse is supposed to be there for you. \n\nSo yeah, NTA. Now your husband, meh. He\u2019s a bit selfish.", "Couple here. If either of us was sick, even just mild sick, neither of us would hesitate to get up at 3am to make coffee for the other. Sure, it can be annoying, but life isn\u2019t all candies and unicorns and rainbows. Doing the hard stuff (and I don\u2019t think this even qualifies as \u201chard stuff\u201d) to support each other is what builds trust in the relationship. You are showing through these little events that you will be there for your partner when shit really hits the fan. His attitude suggests to me that he would skip the birth of your child if it will force him to miss a football game.  \n\nYou are NTA. Your husband needs to learn how to partner or just be single. There\u2019s no room in a healthy relationship for his kind of selfish behavior.", "NTA. For all those saying keep caffeine pills ready or brew it before, let me tell you in many cases, you do require the warm liquid to enter your system to alleviate the pain. And he is her husband, not her roommate, wherein she needs to be mindful of asking for help.", "NTA, a partner should care about your well-being and want to help when you are in severe pain. I'm not Happy being woken up at weird hours but I still care and want to help my partner in similar situations. Not slam stuff around because I'm pissy at being asked to help. This should go both ways. \n\nYou mention your in therapy together? Maybe talk it over there - can both share your sides of things in that space. But to me personal  this signals a deep rooted issue in a relationship and I would be out of there.", "NTA. Posts like these make me even more grateful for my husband of 7 years. He has always gotten up with me when I\u2019m not feeling well, any time of night and asks me if I need anything. Cold wash cloth, meds, back rub, what have you. Heck, this morning even, I was really sweaty and kinda nauseous (9 months pregnant, due any day) so he got up and set up a fan for me without me asking. \n\nCould I have gotten the fan myself? Of course. That\u2019s not the point. \n\nI\u2019ve had migraines before. When I was single, there\u2019s no hell like dragging yourself out of your dark room to go to bathroom and get your meds, or to the kitchen to get an ice pack. \n\nSo for everyone commenting that she was able to make her own coffee so she should\u2019ve just done it to begin with, well yeah. She\u2019s able. But that doesn\u2019t she should have to imho. \n\nOP, I\u2019d just let him cool down a couple days and then try to chat again. If he\u2019s still digging in his heels that he\u2019s in the right, then maybe that\u2019s just a boundary in your relationship. But I\u2019m just going to tell you right now, if you want kids in the future, he\u2019s in for a rude awakening.", "I've been married 26 years.   NTA.   You help your partner when they're ill.   If my wife was in your situation, I'd have coffee ready to brew.", "Im going with NTA. If I asked my partner to do this, he would absolutely do it, and without attitude. I would too. If I\u2019m not well when we\u2019re going to bed, my husband tells me to wake him up if I need him or if it gets bad. I have only done that a couple times, but knowing I can is comforting. While I get the comments about being prepared when you\u2019ve got a medical issue, no one is ready 100% of the time. \n\nWhat I would do going forward - sit down at the dinner table and ask to talk. Tell him what you plan to do going forward (pre brew coffee, etc), apologise for anything if you feel you need to, but explain how the situation made you feel and also what it\u2019s like having migraines. If you aren\u2019t satisfied with conversation, therapy it is. Good luck and I\u2019m sure you can work through this!", "Nta. My mom will get migraines so bad that she can't walk straight. Both my dad and I would rather have her wake us up than struggle downstairs. When you love someone, you help take care of them. One of the benefits of being in a relationship is that you don't have to suffer alone.\n\nOp, you deserve someone who puts as much energy as you into a relationship.", "NTA. You were having a medical emergency, and why would he bother marrying you if he didn\u2019t want to help you when you\u2019re in extreme physical pain? It sounds like you would have helped him if the situation were reversed.", "You know what? All the people telling you, that y-t-a are dumb as f*ck. My husband went to another room( we slept in different rooms bc of a fight the night before) to tell me that he has really bad pain and if I can help him put some clothes on and call the ambulance. And I did. Without question. Thats what every loving person would do. I could have said \" if you can walk over to me and tell me all this things, you can call the ambulance alone\" but I didnt. Bc if you are sick, you want some empathy and the feeling of not beeing alone. \n\nSo, NTA but he is...", "I can't imagine my sweetheart throwing a tantrum for me asking for something to ease my pain, even at 3am.  If he woke me up in the middle of the night, I would do whatever he needed to feel better, and he would do the same for me.\n\nFind yourself a grown ass man who believes that taking care of each other is part of being together and leave that toddler to his tantrums.", "I'm going with NTA. My partner has migraines and has had a cluster headache so bad I needed to call an ambulance once. It was really scary for both of us. If my partner woke me up at 3 a.m. asking for some pain relief, I would of course be sleepy and drowsy, but I would still make the coffee without anger and then get back to bed.  \nI would somewhat get the anger if it was a regular occurrence and he had sleep deprivation from it, but you said he didn't have work the next day, so he could've just taken a nap later to compensate for it. You write that you had already gotten therapy after being married for so little time, so I am guessing there are other issues at play here like him thinking you are exaggerating your symptoms. Maybe in the future you don't need to drop everything that you are doing and take care of him when he complains about something. Remind him that it's a two way partnership.", "NTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t wake your spouse up in the middle of the night to help alleviate some awful, incapacitating pain, what\u2019s the point of being married?\n\nIt sounds like you do as much as you can to manage migraine yourself, and you aren\u2019t frivolous with your requests for help. I put myself in his shoes and if my partner woke me up at 3am for help, I\u2019d be concerned, wanting to help, maybe a little grumpy/annoyed but I would do my best to help him. \n\nAlso, interestingly: I spoke to a neurologist recently and apparently they\u2019re beginning to refer to migraines as a chronic condition called \u201cmigraine\u201d so that it\u2019s more likely to be treated as a chronic condition with multiple symptoms needing treatment, rather than as \u201creally bad headaches sometimes.\u201d", "All of these Y T A are baffling to me. What the hell are you expecting from a relationship? If I went downstairs  at 3 am in excruciating pain to try and make myself coffee, while I\u2019m unable to see very well mind you, instead of waking my husband he would be so mad at me for not asking for help. That\u2019s part of being in a relationship. Helping and caring for each other when you\u2019re sick or in pain. \nApart from that he had the next day (and the days prior) off and minimized her pain by saying \u201eit\u2019s just a headache\u201c. That is peak a-hole behavior right there. \n\nWould it have been smarter to keep a caffeinated beverage by the bed? Yes. But guess what, sometimes you don\u2019t see the obvious solutions. \n\nNTA.", "NTA- your husband can put on his big boy pants and say \u201cno, i\u2019m sorry, i can\u2019t make you coffee right now\u201d but instead he decided to throw a fit. sometimes people get woken up in the middle of the night. it can be for any reason, but it\u2019s never the end of the world. he was acting like a petulant child, and for what?", "NTA. I have a chronic neurological condition and one of the symptoms is migraines and headaches. most people out there have NO clue how difficult, isolating, and depleting it is to deal with chronic pain every single day while managing a full life. most people hear the word migraine and brush it off as \"just a headache\" like your husband did and most likely all of the people voting yta. Your husband is an ass for not taking care of you when you need it by doing a very simple task. sending you healing vibes \ud83e\ude77", "NTA I suffer from chronic migraine (daily for years). People who don't suffer will never understand.", "NTA. Helping your partner with a healt related issue should be a given in any loving relationship. Even in the middle of the night.", "NTA but this is just chaos. It's 3am and no one is going to be in the right mind. You're in a ton of pain and he's clearly exhausted. Then comes a fight and now you're both mad and sticking to your guns. I've learned that a \"I'm sorry but you...\" just never actually resolves anything. Just apologize and move on. You can't really use a 3am wake-up as a reason to be like \"See how this is a real problem with you?\"", "NTA - Your partner is. He didn't even have work the next day, but you did. And you're an absolute badass for going in with a CLUSTER headache. Not a regular headache or a migraine. A condition also referred as suicide headache! \n\nMy partner suffers from regular migraines and if he ever woke me up in the middle of the night, asking for help, I would do absolutely everything in my power to help alleviate the pain.", "Migraine is an emergency in my book. A thoughtful husband prepares the espresso machine on such days before going to bed.\n\nNTA big time\n\n(Black Espresso with a teaspoon of lemon juice eases it for me)", "Going through and seeing some of your replies, I think this is classic, it's not about the coffee. You wanted him to look after you, like you would for him. He failed. \n\nHow long were you together before getting married?", "NTA. Obviously, the coffee was health related and not just a random ask. It\u2019s okay to ask for help, especially from your family. But as you mentioned that you guys are going through therapy, it seems that there are other underlying reasons for why he got mad. Like things are just piling up and the 3am incident was the last straw for that day.", "NTA. This is what partners do for each other, out of concern, not duty. I used to get very bad migraines (less and less as I age) to the point where I would be so nauseous, I would vomit. My partner would be up and out of bed cleaning up and getting me water and medicine even if he had to work in the morning. Because you want to alleviate your partners pain. Expecting your partner to care for you when you are ill is not an asshole move, that's the good parts of being in a loving relationship. And it's what makes the annoying parts of your partner more tolerable. Because when you are together long enough, they will annoy you - but you should at least know they have your back always.", "NTA  \nI never had migranes, don't know the pain, but if my husband would wake me up in the middle of the night because he is feeling ill I would do anything I can to make him feel better (plus making some instant coffee is so easy) and i know he would do the same for me. Partnership is meaningless without empathy and care for eachother.", "NTA. \n\nAs a migraine sufferer, they really are no joke. I've had migraines so bad that I felt like a shotgun blast to the head is the only thing that would alleviate the pain and pressure. The pain is so intense, it takes away all ability to do anything and there is very little that can be done about the pain except to wait it out. It is not unreasonable to ask your partner for help, even at 3am. OP was attempting to avoid an ER visit, which would have been more disruptive of her husband's sleep. She was not at all being thoughtless. Despite her suffering, she was still trying to be considerate while asking for help.\n\nFor all of you saying \"jUst TaKe a CAffEinE PiLL\"... migraines of such intensity are usually accompanied by nausea which tends to escalate to vomiting when pills are taken for said migraine. It's not as simple as you YTA voters think.", "NTA. People don't realize how horrible these things are until they experience it themselves. He would no doubt crumple to the floor if he had what you had that morning, but he's just writing it off as just a headache. I suffered from extreme pain from a disk injury for years and I boiled over with frustration when anyone downplayed my pain. It got to the point where I stopped caring about those people and never helped them with anything out of pure resentment, which is no good either.", "Everyday this sub deteriorates my faith in humanity. These people are really saying YTA while she was in chronic pain because she asked her husband who is supposed to love her to make some coffee ONCE? When she literally says she goes out of her way to help her when he\u2019s sick? She clearly struggled to even get downstairs or finish the coffee herself, maybe she *could* have managed to do it on her own, but it shouldn\u2019t have been that big a deal to the husband in the first place, especially when he doesn\u2019t have work the whole week. People are also acting like she didn\u2019t say the other option was the emergency room.\n\nSometimes in life you actually have to do things that are unfavorable for people you care about. He way overreacted to such a simple request and sounds like a dick from this story. OP was even the relatively mature one and apologized for being rude. \n\nNTA, don\u2019t listen to the no lifes on here who have so sense of empathy whatsoever.", "NTA\n\ni keep thinking about how God forbid you had maybe passed out from the pain or had a  loss of vision and stumbled down the stairs. i wonder what he would have done then.", "NTA\n\nLol it's wild people think YTA. \n\nHave none of you ever been in a serious relationship? You take care of each other.", "NTA - I think this is a classic situation where a woman's pain is easily looked over, because our duties (wake up next day and go to work, take care of your family etc) never stop just because we are sick. Men can lie on the sofa for days because of a runny nose, but women have to soldier through because we are not believed. \n\n I see there are some good suggestions about how this could be handled better - but the people saying he had the right to be grumpy because he was waken from his sleep (in a week when he did not work and I presume had little else to do) - but you were not alowed to be grumpy because you were in such a pain? This is stupid and a double standard. If you make sure to take care of him when he is in pain or suffering or just stressed, then you have the right to demand the same kind of treatment from him. Who else is to help you, if not your SO?  Since you have been together for a while now I presume this is not the first time this has happened. \n\nTo me this is a huge red flag - this is not going to change through your marriage. The best predictor for future behaviour is past behaviour, imo. \n\nSo you have the option of forever taking care of this on your own, going through this pain on your own or maybe take a serious look at your life and ask yourself if this is the level of reciprocity you deserve?", "If my partner takes care of me when I\u2019m sick I\u2019d happily obliged to do that same 3am on a non-work day.

What if you had a medical emergency during the night, your appendix ruptured or something? Is he going to refuse to drive you to hospital because got forbid he\u2019d lose a few hours sleep?!", "Make coffee or cold brew ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator so this never has to happen again.", "NTA. You were sick. \n\nYes, getting awaken at 3 am would surely impact one's mood but it's for a sick person, nonetheless his wife. He could simply do it and get back to bed after. It's not like he was awaken to go outside and buy her Starbucks or something.", "Initially I was going with YTA. \n\nHOWEVER reading how your husband responded, and given the fact he had no work the next day, unlike yourself\u2026.My opinion is you are 100% NTA. \n\nYour husband however is TA.

Your husband is your person and it'd be nice if he had just made you the coffee this one off time. I'm tempted to say just ignore everyone here. I got married at 40 when my life was already settled and my husband and I have no issues, but we were never really tested. I can't imagine being married at 22 while also working and going to school. Life is going to be tough but you're committed to going through it together and you'll grow and change WITH each other. And I think it's fair to want him to become a bit more nurturing and do things for you when you are nearly debilitated and he can rest later. If you woke him up at 3 often, clearly you suck. This was a special one off you asked your special human to do for you. You're newly married, stressed and figuring life out. Ignore the grumpy jerks on Reddit. Cluster headaches are a nightmare, you're going to possibly deal with these for life, your husband signed up for sickness and health. Prove it. And I'm sure you will too.", "Healthcare worker here.\nNTA. In my opinion, if I have problems like this, at least I would expect my partner to be mad silently... if they would get mad over something like this.\nYou see I have very very bad period cramps, I would constantly throw up, crying and things like that, I couldn't even lay down without crying myself to sleep after(!) I took my prescribed painkiller, so I can understand your pain partially (because at least I can predict, when I'm going to be in pain).\nYour partner is childish, you wrote that you've been to therapy and still he behaving like this is just something I couldn't understand.\nAnd all of those who said YTA, OP is a human, she can forgot about coffee beside her bed, and she is in a marriage so I think it's okay to call for help from her husband, even at 3 am, if she's a really really bad migrane. Also, if you are in pain, don't you get irritated and start yelling at the smallest inconveniences?", "He's the asshole.\n\n I also get migraines and cluster headaches. I keep a mini bottle of Coca-Cola in my nightstand, along with instant cold packs. Luckily, I have warning signs when either are going to hit. I smell rotted oranges, smoke, or just a heightened sense of smell. \n\nPeople who do not have these issues do not have a clue.", "NTA, it sounds like you tried a few strategies then really felt like this was the thing that would help. You should be able to ask your husband of all people to help with this kind of health thing. He needs to learn about migraines if he doesn\u2019t believe how debilitating they can be. \n\nI would do this for my wife and she\u2019d do it for me (even though we wouldn\u2019t enjoy it haha)", "NTA! Chronic migraines are a disability and an invisible illness. I totally understand where you felt frustrated and got upset.", "[deleted]", "ESH I live with a partner with debilitating migraines I can understand both sides, but why would you not try to have things ready to help, ice coffee in the fridge means you just have to poor a glass something that you can do even with a headache.   \n\n\nyes your husband should have helped and been less of an asshole but are you preparing and thinking long term for how to deal with your issues without always having to rely on your husband at 4 or 5am  What things can you put in place to make it easier on you both.   \n\n\nAlso unrelated but have you tried an ice helmet it made a massive differnce for my partner", "NTA. \nI get period pains where I turn baby.

When you marry someone you commit to taking care of their needs and feeling loved cared and nurtured is their need so you provide. Goes both ways.

Being said I know how to deal with them a bit better now but with the stress of a full-time job and being a full-time student my migraines have turned into cluster headaches and even sent me to the ER twice in the past year. My husband (26m) and I got married a year and a half ago and it has been rocky but we\u2019ve been going to therapy and doing alright lately. \n\nI came home with a migraine I got during work and by the time I got home I barely wanted to open my eyes. I soaked my feet in hot water and put ice packs on my neck to relieve the pain but to no avail. At around 3 am that morning me and my husband are sleeping and I wake up to a stabbing pain behind my eye. I\u2019ve only had it one other time and It gets so bad my face swells up. I took the migraine pills beside my bed and tried to breathe it out. An hour past and I feel my face swelling and I feel nauseated from the pain so I decide to ask if he can make me coffee since sometimes caffeine helps me. I figured it was between that or asking him to drive me to the ER but thought I would exhaust all my options first. (Just a side note I had work at 6 am and he has been off all week so i was not waking him up when he had work the next day)\n\nHe got upset and stormed downstairs and started slamming stuff around which was just making my head feel worse. I decided to blindly walk downstairs to tell him that I would try to make it myself and to go back to bed only to see the water kettle on and him asleep on the couch. This upset me because although I\u2019ve always been more nurturing between the two of us (I work in healthcare), I always drop whatever I\u2019m doing when he is sick, hurt or even stressed to make sure he is okay and do what I can to help him relax. I told him to go upstairs and he said that I was extremely rude for waking him up. I tried to explain that I only asked him because I\u2019m in a lot of pain and I cant see very well and he just said its \u201cjust a headache and it doesn\u2019t hurt enough that I can still yell at him\u201d. I told him to go upstairs and I just tried to make my coffee in the dark and sip on it. I texted him apologizing for the angry choice of words I used but said that his lack of empathy concerns me, especially because that\u2019s what a partner is for. Someone to help in sickness and in health. He said I was being toxic and selfish and that he\u2019s never woken me up to ask for anything. I let it go and when I got to work I texted him around 9 am and asked if he was awake. He said yes and I asked if he would read through what he sent me just hoping it was him being grumpy and sleepy and he just said \u201ci know what I said and I stand by it\u201d I just didn\u2019t  respond and went to the ER for steroids for my migraine. I\u2019m over talking about it with him because it honestly just makes me upset to see how uncaring he can be but I like reading AITA post and thought.\n\nTIA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, as someone who was accidentally woken up by my husband around the same time last night (he went to check on our daughters and I woke up from the noise), I can tell you that few are ready to handle things well at that hour. \n\nI get that migraines are serious, I\u2019ve even had cluster migraines so understand that it\u2019s a lot, but if you can go in to work, you can make yourself 3am coffee.", "I nfo: how often have you woken him up like this?

Neither of you are going to be in a good place. In this case, if he's already upset that you woke him up, trying to continue having a conversation about it isn't going to make things better.

Admittedly yours sound worse than mine do, but I can at least relate to some degree \u2013 I end up laying in total darkness, in agony, and every sound makes my vision ripple. I get it.\n\nI keep my migraine meds and caffeine-containing OTC meds in four different places: bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, car. That way I nearly always have access to them, or can quickly. Some of it is redundant, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to leave the (dark, cold) bathroom floor to get something from the bright, sunny bedroom.\n\nHave you never lived alone? I get that you got married at 20 or 21, but have you never had to deal with this without relying on someone else?\n\nLike. Did you get married so that you had someone to take care of you? Yes, \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d, but that\u2019s not a substitution for being self-sufficient, that\u2019s for when you cannot be self-sufficient.\n\nIf you melted down over him making noise or turning in the light, I\u2019d get it. If he was awake already, I get it. But this is all self-inflicted \u2013 you know caffeine helps, but you don\u2019t keep it readily available. Yeah, I might be able to get off the floor and make coffee, but you know what? It\u2019s absolute hell. Floor to ceiling windows, I might as well be a vampire with a fear of streetlights when I\u2019m down for the count. That\u2019s why I take efforts to mitigate it before it happens.\n\nIf you\u2019re waking someone up at 3am, it\u2019s because you can\u2019t do it yourself \u2014 like driving to the hospital. Frankly, if you\u2019re so badly hurting all night that you made him get up and make you coffee at 3am, I\u2019m skeptical you should have even been driving to work soon after \u2013 both my father and I can\u2019t drive for shit for a good 6-8 hours after a migraine lets up, or at least 4-6 hours if it aborts after taking meds.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t on meds for your migraines, you need to be. There are plenty of options for abortive meds, which can spare you the worst of it.\n\nBut you really need to start planning for these better.

Have some time for introspection, then sit down and talked about all that after you get home. Just reeks of \u201cI was right, now tell me how you were wrong.\u201d Continuing an argument over text is just a bad idea in general \u2013 tone and body language play a lot in communicating \u2013 but man. I\u2019d lose my cool if I got woken up at 3am to go make coffee, then they followed me down to argue some more, then shortly after they left they tried to resume the argument in text.

I was diagnosed with migraines and cluster headaches since a kid. I have had brain scans due to the doctors thinking I was having strokes. I literally will take 12 liquid advil and 8 extra strength tylonal through a day and it won't help.\n\nI have been to the ER MANY times for these and I am on fluids for like 3 hours every single time.\n\nYou tell people it was so bad that your face was swelling, but then you went into work. Then you said you got fluids on break? Yeah, no.. if it's as bad as you're saying, fluids for 20 minutes is not going to help you.\n\nYou weren't in as bad of shape as you keep telling people (and yourself), that being said, a good spouse wouldn't respond like this. My wife waits on me hand and foot when I have a migraine and I even ask her not too because the best thing for me is to sleep in a dark room. If I asked her to fly a rocket at 3AM for me, she would get up and research it, and I would do the same for her. For these reasons ESH. I think you are being dramatic based on your behavior despite the alleged condition you are in, and I think that it shouldn't be that big of a deal to help your partner out even when tired", "Soft YTA but not because of the other YTAs here\n\nTo the ppl saying \"have caffeine capsules by your bed\" or \"you went downstairs\" you clearly haven't experienced migraines. They aren't \"just headaches\" they can feel like you're going to die. Yes you can move - you're not paralysed - but it is excruciatingly painful to do so and will make the migraine worse and last longer. For those saying why doesn't she have a caffeine pill - she took precautions before going to bed and had migraine pills on her bedside table. I'm the same. I have painkillers by my bed and if I can sense one coming before sleep, I do everything I possibly can to prevent it but it isnt a perfect science. Caffeine does help... sometimes... if you're at that point you're pretty desperate. Also vision is literally impaired by some migraines so yes you can fumble around but you are genuinely a falls risk. So yes she made it down safely on this occasion but that might not have happened otherwise. \n\nYour partner was incredibly unsympathetic. He's a husband, not a room mate. When I've been up with migraines in the night I always try and deal with them myself first, I only ever get my partner up if I'm really worried/sick and its been an hour. Likewise ge struggles with really bad (I mean excruciating) indigestion due to a life saving surgery that means he can't vomit. He also tries not to wake me up but his burping and gagging (even from the other room) sometimes wakes me up and I give him a back rub and some support. So no its not fun being woken up at 3am and its understandable you both got heated. His argument that you cld have got it yourself isn't kind but maybe its indirectly a dig at what I'm getting to...\n\nWhere YTA... a full time job and a full time masters is a lot to take on. Migraines are a stress related illness. If you know what you're doing rn is causing you so much stress its triggering them you have to re-evaluate that. *Your body is telling you something*  Your partner hasn't chosen for you to do 2 full time things that have increased your health issues, that's on you. Yes you can't control migraines but you can control what makes them worse. I would seriously think about cutting down the hours of one of them. I know that adds time but what's the most important thing here? Health. Don't take it for granted. Being this stressed is not good for your body now, and we know its not good long term either. Why do you need to do the masters full time? And an indirect consequence of this is the toll its taking on ur relationship. I think you need to speak to a dr, work OT and a masters professor. This isn't sustainable.\n\nListen to your body. You've only got one. \n\nAnd with marriage - its good you're in counselling. I think you need to bring this up. Maybe he really struggles with broken sleep (if I miss out on even an hour compared to usual I struggle the next day), maybe he's actually frustrated that your life choices (that you can control) are making you sicker or maybe he's a unempathetic arsehole, or something else or a combination of a few things... ultimately is this a battle worth continuing? Only you can decide that.", "Apologise for not having had the foresight to keep some caffeine next to your bed. Learn & improve. \n\nBut still, clear NTA.

Some migraine medicine has caffeine in it and taking too many tablets can lead to a caffeine dependency.

You both deserve to feel loved and respected in your relationship, but it\u2019s up to both of you to *clearly* communicate\n- what you both need & want in order to feel loved and respected \n- what that looks like in practice (i.e. to be cared for in xyz ways at xyz times etc.)\n- what your respective boundaries are (i.e. him saying no to getting you caffeine, or blanket rule about waking the other up, e.g)\n\nYou can never rely on the other person having the same understanding of what marriage/love/support looks like.

Even if he did have to get up to work the next day, we *all* have days when we drag our asses into work and unless he's working with volatile chemicals or the like, he can sacrifice some sleep to help care for a partner who's in significant pain and suffering.", "I think people who\u2019ve never had a migraine find it hard to understand just how debilitating it can be.

Is he always this dismissive of your needs? If so, you deserve better. If this is a rarity, maybe he had something else going on and he took it out on you (which also isn\u2019t ok, but maybe it\u2019ll be something you can talk through with him).\n\nIf he\u2019s going to be unhelpful or cruel when you\u2019re in agony, I\u2019d be rethinking how much I\u2019m willing to help him when he\u2019s sick.

When I had covid, he got my medication for me and asked what else I needed. \n\nI'd be happy to wake up in the middle of the night to do a simple task to make my partner comfortable.

I wonder if your health issue has consumed the marriage and your husband is just done. I am a caregiver to two family members with significant health issues. They do everything in their power to be independent and only ask for help when they are truly in need, even if it is uncomfortable for them. They are both both very careful about not using me as their therapist to constantly vent about their health issue. They communicate the status of their health issues, but don\u2019t victimize themselves and put that on my shoulders. Because of that, I have been able to care for them for years without any resentment. Your health condition will destroy your marriage if you let it. You have to understand how exhausting it is for your spouse to constantly hear about it and to constantly be put in a situation where they have to care for you. If your spouse has a genuine love and concern for you, they will gladly help you when you are in need. But if you are acting needy when you could be independently functioning, then testing them to see how they will react, that will turn anyone\u2019s heart cold. Your spouse also sucks here because he is doing a horrible job communicating. His poor communication is coming off as contempt instead of concern. That is a problem. If you both establish healthier roles in regards to your health condition and he still doesn\u2019t show softness and concern in a healthy way, then he is an A. If you have exhausted your ability and need your husband\u2019s help, you should be able to trust him to step up and help, if he won\u2019t- you will never have emotional safety with him. He also needs to feel that you are taking the appropriate level of responsibility for your own health issues and not using it as a tool to test his loyalty. In this situation, maybe you learned you need to better prepared (even my friend at age 7 kept a Diet Coke in his desk and backpack because of his migraines), but you should also be allowed to be human and sometimes not be 100% prepared without your husband throwing a fit, that\u2019s not ok either. Figure this out before you start trying for kids. Because introducing children into this situation will not be fair to them if you haven\u2019t done the work to be a team. If you can\u2019t find a healthy way of functioning with your health condition, try marriage therapy. Many people with chronic health conditions have to grieve the impact on their lives and renegotiate their role in relationships because of that health condition.
