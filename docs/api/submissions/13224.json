It also doesn't always happen).  When that head is appearing, that is what the focus is on.  He will be watching the baby come out, not thinking of your bits.  He will be watching you in your awesome strength bring his child into the world; a child that can be anything they want to be.  I have caught hundreds of babies.  I have no memories of the vulvas or who pooped.

Because of your age and newness of relationship I totally get what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re probably still at the stage where you run the shower so your partner doesn\u2019t hear you pee and poop! I don\u2019t want to come off as dismissing your feelings but after being with my husband for 20 years now\u2026I can tell you, all that shyness goes right out the door. You guys become extensions of one another.  There is a true bond and trust that comes with relationships and babies and making families.  I remember being concerned that I might poop the table when I pushed. I\u2019m almost certain I caught a quick look away from my husband and it was only years later that he teased me about it. He was truly so respectful and discreet at the time and the nurses quickly got rid of it in half a second so it was long forgotten in all the excitement of his seeing the baby crown and be born.  To this day, when I think of giving birth to our firstborn, I remember his excitement when he saw her crowning. When he saw her hair color and when she came out. He wasn\u2019t thinking about how gross it all was. He was singularly focused on our baby and my health. Your SO should and hopefully will be too. I\u2019m so glad my husband and I have that lasting memory. If you can try to get over the weirdness of being so vulnerable you would be giving you both the most incredible gift. \n\nAlso\u2026not sure how far along you are, but I will say I often joke with my girlfriends about how shy I used to be in my 20\u2019s and how pregnancy changed all that. By the time you\u2019re actively giving birth, a whole lot of strangers have seen your good and \u201cchecked\u201d your cervix.  You get over it all pretty quickly.", "Please don\u2019t take this way from him, almost 10 years later, and he still talks about how amazing it was seeing his first (both, but the first is the one that made him a dad.) child. I\u2019m not going to flat out say YTA, but\u2026 I do say YTA very lightly. You really need to think about this, and what you are talking away from him. You, nor anyone else will ever be able to give him the gift of seeing his FIRST CHILD come into the world. It\u2019s a super important bonding moment between some dads, and their kids, too. Also, to my shock s lol and horror, it\u2019s not like in the movies, they don\u2019t hang a blanket over your legs on the bed stirrups.", "[deleted]", "NAH.

I'm sure that all of the things you're worrying about happening with you happened with my wife. Know what I remember? I remember my wife's face, I remember holding her hand, and I remember holding my babies. That's about it. Oh, and for my oldest I got to cut the cord; I remember that, too. The rest of what I did or did not see wasn't important and didn't stick with me. What I most remember is what I felt in those moments - joy, amazement, fear, love. Overwhelming in the best way.\n\nAt a certain level, I think it's like someone helping you when you're sick. It can be embarrassing and gross in the moment, but by the next morning most of the details are forgotten.\n\nAt a different level, I'd encourage you to see it from his side as well. It's an emotionally heavy moment for **both** parents. For the dad, seeing that baby literally making its appearance in the world ... I can't explain to you how wonderfully small you can feel in that moment. I also worry that forbidding him to watch is going to communicate to him a lot about your trust in him (or, more properly, your lack thereof), and his place in your relationship. Those feelings could echo forward for years.\n\nNAH.\n\nI can see where both of you are coming from, and I think all of your feelings are relatable.

I say this as someone who has had two kids, my most recent 2 months ago.\n\nI completely understand not wanting your partner to see you give birth. It is an intense process. Lots goes on.\n\nMy partner watched for both - the first was a vaginal birth. He didn't see me poo, since at that point he was focused on helping me through the early practice pushes and watching the monitor to tell me when a contraction was coming (I had an epidural so couldn't always tell). When it came to the final few pushes, he did watch. He saw me tear.\n\nWith my second, I had a C-section since baby flipped the wrong way round. He watched them take the baby out.\n\nFor both - he said although it was intense it made him respect me and my body so much more. To see what I went through to bring our children into the world forget changed his view on my body - in an intensely positive way. I've got stretch marks, scars, beat up boobs, soft tummy. But he loves each and every part of me - each and every reminder of how I carried out children and brought them into the world. His attraction to me hasn't changed.\n\nBefore I had our first I was worried that him watching would make him less attracted to me, or that he'd see something \"gross\". But now on the other side, I can say there's so much your partner should support you through in postpartum.\n\nYou never know what you may need help with - I needed help showering, help cleaning incisions and tearing, help cleaning myself up sometimes. Since he had already seen the birth process, it was easier mentally to let him help with everything else I needed.\n\nNo matter what you decide, this is your decision. You may not even care once you're close to giving birth. But you allowed to voice your concerns.", " NAH but \u2026 your feelings of vulnerability sound like discomfort with having him see a gross part of you.

Labor is such s process that by the time you\u2019re pushing he won\u2019t think of it as gross. He\u2019ll probably just feel bad for you.

Everyone understands your fabricated situation. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. The sun would probably say she\u2019s the asshole if she denied him being present for the birth. But that\u2019s not the situation here at all. Read this very carefully: She doesn\u2019t not want him in the room, she doesn\u2019t want him staring at her vagina while the baby emerges. \n\nOne more time: If she was saying she didn\u2019t want him in the room then the subreddit would feel different. That\u2019s not the situation at hand. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between being present for your child\u2019s birth and watching your child come into the world and literally watching your child emerge from her vagina. They\u2019re very different things. My dad saw me be born, meaning he was in the room and even cut the cord. He did not watch me emerge from my mothers vagina. \n\nI can\u2019t believe I have to explain this to you.", "Because no matter what, SHE is the one having the procedure! You can not reverse that. So yeah she should be as comfortable as possible, whether she wants the husband there or not.", "Ok? I don't understand what you mean. The 2 people that originally started this comment thread were disagreeing about a wording issue and everyone is making it some sort of an argument of hospital birth versus homebirth which I'm pretty sure wasn't the point.", "Then that's your country.\n\nI want you to do your research, I want you to do what *you* want to do whatever that is, but I want you to have all the information at hand so that you can make your decision.  I don't want you to blindly follow what someone says because of who they are.  This is your life, your body, your autonomy.  You take charge of it, and if you want to know where to find the research then ask.", "I have been told by many people, I\u2019ve done my research, I\u2019ve experienced the loss of my nephew last year who would be with us now if my sister had been listened to by her doctors and had been induced. His heart failed because he stayed in the womb too long when they knew she was high risk. I know what I\u2019m doing, but to say there\u2019s no reason to be induced is dangerous when it can save lives."]}
