It's really his job to help you feel as at ease and supported as possible. If that means promising not to look or to leave the room when asked, he should do it.

It is beautiful in all this; the most everyday of miracles.  It is a room filled with feminine power and overarching love.  And your fiance is not going to care how your vulva looks, or if you squeeze some toothpaste-shaped poop out of the next hole too (the midwife or obstetric nurse will clean it up anyway; we are used to it happening.  It also doesn't always happen).  When that head is appearing, that is what the focus is on.  He will be watching the baby come out, not thinking of your bits.  He will be watching you in your awesome strength bring his child into the world; a child that can be anything they want to be.  I have caught hundreds of babies.  I have no memories of the vulvas or who pooped.  I have seen dads watch their babies born and they don't care about anything but the sheer strength of their partner and the love of their child.  \n\nAll this being said, you are the most important person.

You may feel differently when in the moment, so much is going on you may not care. BUT if you feel that way when you arrive at the hospital tell the staff. If they are a good team to you, they will make it happen. If your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t listen and it makes you uncomfortable, advocate for yourself and let them know. Labor is just that, labor.

My husband is the #1 person I\u2019m comfortable with and want in the room with me for support. I understand totally your husband wanting to be there for you and your baby.

Although honestly who knows what will end up happening once you're in the room.  My husband was with me helping me with rocking, breathing, letting me clench his hand, etc.   As things went on he did help with holding one of my legs when it was push time.   When it is really 'go' time you literally get tunnel vision and aren't aware of much other than the job you have to do.   \n\n\nMy point is, it's fine to have preferences but this is just going to matter so so little to you once the actual birth happens.    My kid is in their teens now and I could not tell you exactly how much my husband did or did not see.   I had a job to do and he helped me immensely and that's what matters.", "NTA. It's totally understandable that you don't want your fianc\u00e9 to watch you give birth. It's a very personal and intimate moment, and you have every right to feel how you do. That being said, it's also a special moment for him, and you could try to find a compromise that works for both of you.

My husband straight up is like, \"I am NOT looking. It's like watching my favorite toy get destroyed.\" He's an infant, lol. This is not my first. With my daughter, I can tell you that the only person who will know if you do shit yourself is the nurse or doctor. It is so discreet and fast the clean up. And you'll be freshened up so regularly that YOU won't know if you did or not. I actually asked for a mirror so I could watch. Found it helped me.
