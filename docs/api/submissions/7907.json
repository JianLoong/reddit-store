The floor isn't a designated place to store items, much less fragile items. If she really wanted to keep her phone safe, she should have kept it closer to her. It's a gym, there are weights, weights are heavy, heavy things crush lighter things.\n\nGiving her \u00a3100 is more than fair enough on your part, I'd argue you didn't owe her anything at all tbh, but it's a nice gesture from yourself.", "NTA\n\nAnd my god, how nice are you to even have to ask about this one? Lol\n\nYou're a gem dude, you got nothing to worry about here. You did more than mass majority of others would have.", "NTA. Gym floor is not safe place for phone. So it is hers resposibility if someone else damages it. 100% her fault. It is not your responsibility to look for things on floor at the gym that shouldnt be there in the first place.", "NTA, you quickly agreed to send her a good chunk of change to help cover what was essentially her mistake. Socially it feels a bit awkward seeing her doing the same thing again but I think you handled this fine. People shouldn\u2019t have their phones loose at the gym.", "NTA. You were more than fair. There is no way to construe this where you did something wrong.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would she want to keep her phone on the floor? Like you said, her phone is her responsibility. Besides, you already gave her some money towards her phone getting fixed and she tried to get more from you (which I don\u2019t think is cool)", "NTA giving her 100 pounds was generous as the phone shouldnt have been on the floor in the first place.", "NTA. You were more than generous with the 100 pounds. I would have been more likely to say \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry this happened. There\u2019s a phone shop across the road, let\u2019s go there after the workout, get your screen replacement done and I will pay for it.\u201d Your GF is right, you were more than fair.", "NTA, if she worries about her phone she shouldn't leave it on the floor. The $100 was more than enough.", "NTA\n\nShe was the person that left a fragile object in place around heavy weights that are capable of crushing object like phones easily like an egg, so it really on her for leaving it on the floor where you as a guest are using the training station with heavy weights.\n\nYou went out of your way to pay so that she can get it repaired for damages that was her own fault and not yours. You did your good deed and if she can't own up to her own mistake then that's her problem!!  \n\n\nEdit: You also went a step further and pointed out that she did the same mistake again which would have likely ended up with more damages then \u00a3100, so you did well there even if it wasn't your \"duty\" to prevent her from making the same mistake again.   \nOf course it was probably for the best that you pointed it out or else she may have tried to blame you again and \"demand\" you to pay for further damages on her phone!", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t have given her a penny. You were doing as the place intended: working out. She had her phone in the way of that, so I would argue the cracked phone was on her. \n\nAs an aside, I wonder if the cracked screen was the only damage.", "NTA - you were nice enough to compensate her generously for a mistake. Most people wouldn\u2019t be so kind. Seeing her committing the same act of leaving her phone on the floor is like driving near a damaged vehicle and realized by the way the other driver is maneuvering their vehicle that they most likely caused the damage to their car.", "NTA - The opposite of an AH; you were generous. She was irresponsible - why would anyone leave their phone on the floor by the weight rack? And of course, she could have had the insurance plan. She's a person who made bad choices and wants someone else to take responsibility.", "NTA", "Nta. I wouldn\u2019t have even seen it likely. Phone on floor at the gym is just an accident waiting to happen.", "NTA! \n\nI think it was more than nice of you to give her any money at all. Her phone, like you said, is her responsibility and if she puts it on the floor, she is just ASKING for it. haha. It's not everyone else's responsibility to look out for HER phone wherever she places it. Next time, maybe she can put her phone up somewhere higher, leave it in her locker, keep it on her person, or something. Personally, I wouldn't have given her more, if any, for her putting her phone somewhere where she KNOWS people walk, etc. Her own carelessness and (harsh to say, stupidity) broke the phone. You shouldn't have to pay for that. So, since you did, you are better than I! haha", "*Was* the  screen of her phone cracked before your weight slipped and landed on it? Was it, or does gym girl\nhave a little scam going on here? Hmmmmm?\n\nShe bears responsibility. here, too, for leaving her phone lying around like that. And it sounds like she hasn\u2019t learned her lesson, what with again leaving her phone lying around in a trafficked area. \n\nYou were generous enough NTA \n\nAnd maybe mention her to the gym attendant?

I leave my phone on the floor often depending on the exercise I\u2019m doing and have dropped a weight in my phone myself. If you leave it where it can get broken chances are eventually it will.", "NTA\nIf anything, I have a suspicion that she's trying a bit of a scam and the phone was already damaged. \nSomeone is unfortunate enough, this time it was you, to drop something on it or stand on it \"YOU BROKE MY PHONE.

You sent her \u00a3100 more than I would have.\nDon't leave your phone on the floor, especially not in the gym by a weights rack.\nIf you don't look after your stuff, you can't complain if something happens to it.  \nI've seen a few similar posts recently, why do so many people need phones in the gym anyway? Instagram pics? Tiktoks? Music? Just leave it in your locker!", " people put their phone on the floor next to the bench or machine they are using all the time. If the phone was within an arms reach of her and not across the gym you\u2019re the asshole.  You broke her screen, and $100 isn\u2019t going to get you a real screen replacement on your phone.\n\nEdit: judgment, revised to do to the information that the phone was below the weight rack. NTA", "I did think about sending her nothing but I was worried it would escalate. I didn\u2019t want her going to the staff and creating a problem. I like going to that gym and I worried that as a guy if she got upset I would seem like an AH for not giving some money - just wanted to avoid it all!", "Yeah she did say after that would have been fair but I said I didn\u2019t want to hang around. The girl is right, it is likely to be more than \u00a3100 but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay for all of it. My girlfriend also said if she has an expensive phone, she should consider insuring it if she can\u2019t afford to pay out of pocket, or at least be more careful with it", ">And maybe mention her to the gym attendant? They can keep an eye on her and see if this is a pattern.\n\nYes good idea.. this sounds fishy!", "Yeah, if her phone was a Nokia 3310 I might have tripped and died!

She wasn\u2019t looking for a new phone, we looked at the phone together and had a discussion about screen replacement. Overall she wasn\u2019t a horrible person or anything, she was upset and probably worried about not being able to afford to fix the mistake", "I get wanting your phone with you for listening to music- I keep mine with me but just make sure it is somewhere safe. Lots of machines have a space for putting your phone down - but yes I agree if that\u2019s not an option or you haven\u2019t insured etc best to leave it in a locker!", "It wasn\u2019t right next to her bench, it was at the base of the weight rack. If it was closer to her or slightly under the bench the weight would have completely missed. I understand people putting their phone on the floor to a certain extent but I wouldn\u2019t do it myself if it was a walkway or next to a rack people are constantly hovering weights over. I do see what you\u2019re saying which is why I gave her some money but overall I feel that accidents happen and if your phones on the floor someone might step on it for example. I personally wouldn\u2019t expect someone to pay me the full amount if the situation was reversed, I think we both had some culpability", "It's completely up to you whether you wanted to or not but most gyms should have CCTV, you could have reasonably explained your side of the story and chances are, the staff would probably not escalate the situation any further.\n\nI understand though and it's tough to be able to forsee the outcome of a situation sometimes, still, \u00a3100 is a lot of money to avoid confrontation, but hey if you feel like you did the right thing, then that's all that matters.", "Honestly the 100 was overly generous- fact is it was her fault and she was being completely entitled.", "Smart.", "I know. I'm saying. He payed for it. He's not an asshole. He broke it. He payed for it = not an asshole.", "It\u2019s still your fault.  The weight would not have fallen off if you had put it away properly.  I have been to many gyms and have a home gym.  Weights don\u2019t just fall off the racks unless they aren\u2019t put on them properly.", "OP broke a genuine apple screen.\n\nExpect the victim to get a cheap replacement.", "You make no sense", "\u00a3400 u wetty", "But then she did it again... I don't get it but you are definitely NTA. You'd think she'd learn! \n\nHave an awesome day!", "That makes a lot more sense. Putting it under the rack is dumb. I edited my comment.", "It wasn\u2019t necessarily to avoid conflict, I did feel like it wasn\u2019t really my fault but she was upset and I did feel bad in that moment, it was unfortunate the weight slipped off the rack but it was an accident and it does happen. I really just wanted to crack on with my session and go home, she was under 25 and seemed panicked so I just sent the money. It did then piss me off that she instantly said it wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover it. At that point I just said I\u2019m not sending more and I walked away", "I completely agree that it is my fault the weight slipped off and it was my responsibility to make sure it is secure. But there are foam mats around that area to mitigate the risk of damage to the surrounding floor. It\u2019s worth noting, the phone was almost touching the weight rack, it didn\u2019t have to roll at all to hit her phone and even if she just had her phone a little closer to her or under the bench it wouldn\u2019t have been the issue. The question is not whether it\u2019s my fault the weight fell, I take responsibility for that, it\u2019s more that I feel it is her responsibility to keep her belongings safe and not 2 minutes later I saw her with her phone on the floor where people were walking", "I'm thinking if it was worth so much she shouldn't have in on the gym floor. Twice.", "True. It's one of my flaws.", "I'm thinking if OP can't control the weights, OP shouldn't lift them.", "OP did mention the weight fell off the rack after he set it on the rack. I'm just thinking the lady was very careless with her phone.\n\nThat is all.", "As previously mentioned, if OP can't control the weights, OP shouldn't be lifting them.\n\nImagine he dropped the weight on a person. I think he should learn from this, put his ego to the side. Be the better person and take the phone to apple to inspect the damage and repair.\n\nWould you be happy if somebody vandalised your BMW and the insurance gave you a Fiat as a replacement?", "First off, I don't like BMWs (or Fiats). Second, this wasn't vandalism. Seriously, though, who would leave their phone on the floor in a public place? Thirdly,  you are entitled to your opinion,  as is everyone else (including me) that thinks OP is NTA.", "OK, I'm sure we can agree that OP broke her phone due to incompetence.\n\nPerhaps OP should seek therapy to find out why he feels the need to lift weights he can't control and maybe overcome his victim mentality.\n\nHave a great day.", "We can definitely agree that he broke the phone lol.", "You\u2019ve been scammed. She\u2019s deliberately putting her phone where people will step on it or drop things on it in order to extort money from them. Ask to see cctv if the gym has any and I bet you\u2019ll see her place it there and more than once.", "NTA.\n\nI would have given her nothing. Her phone was on the floor for crissake.\n\nNot only that, but you saw it there AGAIN. Obviously she learned no lesson from this.", "NTA, She should be more cautious about where she puts her belongings. The floor is NOT a place to put shit whatsoever.", "Honestly, it looks like a scam. NTA.", "I somehow feel like she's scamming people by guilt tripping them", "YTA. you shouldnt have given her shit.", "I don\u2019t think it was that sophisticated to be honest, this is really not that kind of place and if it is it\u2019s a ridiculous scam and there\u2019s much easier ways to scam people", "Just saw a clip where some dude was being stupid with his phone at the gym, poking it around weight machines and such, and....\n\nIt got crushed when dude working out released the weights.\n\nOf course, phone guy blamed weight guy for it."]}
