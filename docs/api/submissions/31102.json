I didn't really want it to happen and wasn't exactly looking to make them my new dad and sister. They never really became that either but I have accepted that they are family. With my stepsister, her mom chose not to be in her life and she always longed for a family, where she had a mom and maybe some siblings. It made us all living together uncomfortable with me and her wanting very different things and her dad and my mom really unhappy with how I felt about us becoming a \"real family\" as they would put it.\n\nWe're all okay now. Not so close. But no hate or animosity there anymore. At least it was hidden well until this.\n\nSo my stepsister married when she was 20 and had her son then too. She lost her husband 2 years ago. Her son is now 9. My stepsister has met a man, a widower, and he has two kids under three. They are trying to get to the point where they move in together but her son is not really blending with them, which is how she said it. He's not unkind or rude. But he's not really making an effort is how she views it. And he has said he doesn't want to be part of the new family she wants.\n\nThey decided to go away for the weekend together and see if that would be a good experience and whether it would help them bond. She said her son ignored when the 3 year old wanted to hold his hand and then he didn't want to sit with her partner who was also looking at the stars on their first night there. He also didn't want to take photos with them all.\n\nSo she decided I needed to talk to him as someone who also lost my dad. She said the adult me could give him a more mature insight into everything. I told her I would talk to him but I would not read from a script. She told me to just be honest.\n\nI did talk to her son. I assured him that how he was feeling was okay and that I had felt the same way. I told him it was okay for his feelings to change and I answered honestly that mine hadn't really, they had just softened so I could like them as people even if they weren't my dad and sister. He liked hearing that and he said he really did believe that would be how he'd feel and I assured him it was okay. He was honest with how he just didn't feel the way his mom wanted to and I related with him with that.\n\nMy stepsister did not like that and a couple of days later she was calling to curse me out and saying I didn't help her like I had said I would. She told me her son was more sure now that he didn't want to try and be a family with them and she told me I was so selfish to ruin her life the way I had ruined my mom's. I told her my concern was with her son and how he was doing. She told me to go fuck myself.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700164766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wvwx2/aita_for_telling_my_stepsisters_son_the_honest/", "score": 3274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem to be the only one thinking of the child's feelings here, mostly because you lived that experience and have empathy for it. Nothing about that could be asshole behavior.", "NTA. She asked you to tell the truth about your experience and you did. She could\u2019ve asked you exactly what you would tell him. You can\u2019t force an insta-family. My ex-husband, my two daughters, his new girlfriend and her four younger kids are learning this after blending families after 5 months of dating.", "NTA. \n\nYou did that family a favor. Your stepsister is trying to push some unrealistic \"one happy family\" narrative onto her son and it's creating tension and anxiety in everyone. By saying what you said, you let him know that he deserves time and space to get to know his new stepfather and step-siblings and that it's okay for him to take his time as long as he's not a jerk about it.\n\nYour stepsister then blew all that up, which is unfortunate.", "NTA\n\nYour stepsister asked for you to talk to her son about your experience, and you said you would, but not go off a script.

While I understand your stepsister\u2019s point of view \u2014 who doesn\u2019t want their family all together, and caring and happy \u2014 it\u2019s a little asshole-ish to be so engrossed with your vision of \u201chappy family\u201d, that you turn a blind eye to how others may be feeling.", "NTA\n\nKid deserves what you gave", "Info: \n\nI\u2019m curious if you and your step-sister have ever had a conversation since becoming adults about what it was like for you growing up in the combined \u201cfamily\u201d.

Then your stepsister could have said, \"You know what?  Never mind.  I'll talk to him.\" if it was a message she didn't want him to hear.", "Definitely NTA. You were just being honest and giving your step-nephew a different perspective. It's important for kids to know that they have the right to their own feelings, even if it doesn't align with what their parents want. It's unfortunate that your stepsister reacted that way, but you were just looking out for the well-being of her son.", "OP, I\u2019m having mixed feelings about it.

I\u2019m a daughter of divorced parents, so I haven\u2019t been through the same exact situation, but I know how it\u2019s like to hate having an absolute stranger into your life and your parent desperately wanting you to accept and bond with this person THEY CHOSE HAVING IN THEIR LIVES. So it can be extremely tranquillizing to know that we\u2019re not \u201cmonsters\u201d for not wanting to have any kind of relationship with that person.\nHowever, the way you approached this might have kinda backfired, since it only enforced the idea that he could just completely shut down to the guy and his children. Like, he can absolutely do it, he is in no way obliged to form a bond with the dude, but since he\u2019s just a kid who\u2019s hurting for losing his dad, he might have interpreted your talk as a validation for him to just hate the guy, you know? \nBut I definitely think that you acknowledging his feelings was valuable.", "NTA you did great and your step sis is trying to force her fantasy on her kid", "NTA, your sister lacks awareness though, why would she recruit the enemy to convince her so of a blended family.", "\"be honest, but not your kind of honest.

But pushing the perfect family narrative, on her son won't help it will just make him resentful. At the end of the day he is the only one who can make the choice of how he feels about them.

You can't just force someone to be family.", "NTA. Your sister didn\u2019t want you to tell him the truth.

Idk about the new bf is an A H if he isn\u2019t aware of the situation.", "NTA. but also, I can tottaly see how your stepsister feels like you did this to slight her.\n\nLike you made it clear to her and her son you never saw his mom as family and that it's ok for him to feel the same (and ya validating his feelings was right but I'm also assuming you didn't let his mom know just how honest you were going to be) so now it's kinda like she's back to having no family and you may have caused even more distance not just between the blended family she wanted but also between her and her son.It felt a little vindictive.\n\nIts posaible from her point of view it looks like \"this person who never wanted to be my family just took another opportunity to make sure I can't have a family\" could you have maybe suggested family as well as seperat therapy for her son so he could voice his concerns and they could possibly work through it to find a comfortable middle ground or at least one where your sister doesn't feel like your trying to turn her son against her and refuse to let her move on.\n\n (I'm not saying you are but she's a widow and a single mother and considering you tolerate her but don't seem to have any real affection for her I wonder if thats why you couldn't give her the same kindness and honesty you gave her son.

They don\u2019t even get that option when they\u2019re thrown together just before becoming family members.  It\u2019s chaotic and crazy.

We saw our bonus family members not as intruders or replacements, but as decent people trying their best, who made our loved ones happy.
