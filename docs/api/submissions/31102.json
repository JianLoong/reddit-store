I didn't really want it to happen and wasn't exactly looking to make them my new dad and sister. They never really became that either but I have accepted that they are family. With my stepsister, her mom chose not to be in her life and she always longed for a family, where she had a mom and maybe some siblings. It made us all living together uncomfortable with me and her wanting very different things and her dad and my mom really unhappy with how I felt about us becoming a \"real family\" as they would put it.\n\nWe're all okay now. Not so close. But no hate or animosity there anymore. At least it was hidden well until this.\n\nSo my stepsister married when she was 20 and had her son then too. She lost her husband 2 years ago. Her son is now 9. My stepsister has met a man, a widower, and he has two kids under three. They are trying to get to the point where they move in together but her son is not really blending with them, which is how she said it. He's not unkind or rude. But he's not really making an effort is how she views it. And he has said he doesn't want to be part of the new family she wants.\n\nThey decided to go away for the weekend together and see if that would be a good experience and whether it would help them bond. She said her son ignored when the 3 year old wanted to hold his hand and then he didn't want to sit with her partner who was also looking at the stars on their first night there. He also didn't want to take photos with them all.\n\nSo she decided I needed to talk to him as someone who also lost my dad. She said the adult me could give him a more mature insight into everything. I told her I would talk to him but I would not read from a script. She told me to just be honest.\n\nI did talk to her son. I assured him that how he was feeling was okay and that I had felt the same way. I told him it was okay for his feelings to change and I answered honestly that mine hadn't really, they had just softened so I could like them as people even if they weren't my dad and sister. He liked hearing that and he said he really did believe that would be how he'd feel and I assured him it was okay. He was honest with how he just didn't feel the way his mom wanted to and I related with him with that.\n\nMy stepsister did not like that and a couple of days later she was calling to curse me out and saying I didn't help her like I had said I would. She told me her son was more sure now that he didn't want to try and be a family with them and she told me I was so selfish to ruin her life the way I had ruined my mom's. I told her my concern was with her son and how he was doing. She told me to go fuck myself.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700164766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wvwx2/aita_for_telling_my_stepsisters_son_the_honest/", "score": 1474, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem to be the only one thinking of the child's feelings here, mostly because you lived that experience and have empathy for it. Nothing about that could be asshole behavior.", "NTA. She asked you to tell the truth about your experience and you did. She could\u2019ve asked you exactly what you would tell him. You can\u2019t force an insta-family. My ex-husband, my two daughters, his new girlfriend and her four younger kids are learning this after blending families after 5 months of dating.", "NTA. \n\nYou did that family a favor. Your stepsister is trying to push some unrealistic \"one happy family\" narrative onto her son and it's creating tension and anxiety in everyone. By saying what you said, you let him know that he deserves time and space to get to know his new stepfather and step-siblings and that it's okay for him to take his time as long as he's not a jerk about it.\n\nYour stepsister then blew all that up, which is unfortunate.", "NTA\n\nYour stepsister asked for you to talk to her son about your experience, and you said you would, but not go off a script.

While I understand your stepsister\u2019s point of view \u2014 who doesn\u2019t want their family all together, and caring and happy \u2014 it\u2019s a little asshole-ish to be so engrossed with your vision of \u201chappy family\u201d, that you turn a blind eye to how others may be feeling.", "NTA\n\nKid deserves what you gave", "Info: \n\nI\u2019m curious if you and your step-sister have ever had a conversation since becoming adults about what it was like for you growing up in the combined \u201cfamily\u201d.

Then your stepsister could have said, \"You know what?  Never mind.  I'll talk to him.\" if it was a message she didn't want him to hear.", "Definitely NTA. You were just being honest and giving your step-nephew a different perspective. It's important for kids to know that they have the right to their own feelings, even if it doesn't align with what their parents want. It's unfortunate that your stepsister reacted that way, but you were just looking out for the well-being of her son.", "OP, I\u2019m having mixed feelings about it.

I\u2019m a daughter of divorced parents, so I haven\u2019t been through the same exact situation, but I know how it\u2019s like to hate having an absolute stranger into your life and your parent desperately wanting you to accept and bond with this person THEY CHOSE HAVING IN THEIR LIVES. So it can be extremely tranquillizing to know that we\u2019re not \u201cmonsters\u201d for not wanting to have any kind of relationship with that person.\nHowever, the way you approached this might have kinda backfired, since it only enforced the idea that he could just completely shut down to the guy and his children. Like, he can absolutely do it, he is in no way obliged to form a bond with the dude, but since he\u2019s just a kid who\u2019s hurting for losing his dad, he might have interpreted your talk as a validation for him to just hate the guy, you know? \nBut I definitely think that you acknowledging his feelings was valuable.", "NTA you did great and your step sis is trying to force her fantasy on her kid", "NTA, your sister lacks awareness though, why would she recruit the enemy to convince her so of a blended family.", "\"be honest, but not your kind of honest.

But pushing the perfect family narrative, on her son won't help it will just make him resentful. At the end of the day he is the only one who can make the choice of how he feels about them.

Idk about the new bf is an A H if he isn\u2019t aware of the situation.", "NTA. but also, I can tottaly see how your stepsister feels like you did this to slight her.\n\nLike you made it clear to her and her son you never saw his mom as family and that it's ok for him to feel the same (and ya validating his feelings was right but I'm also assuming you didn't let his mom know just how honest you were going to be) so now it's kinda like she's back to having no family and you may have caused even more distance not just between the blended family she wanted but also between her and her son.It felt a little vindictive.\n\nIts posaible from her point of view it looks like \"this person who never wanted to be my family just took another opportunity to make sure I can't have a family\" could you have maybe suggested family as well as seperat therapy for her son so he could voice his concerns and they could possibly work through it to find a comfortable middle ground or at least one where your sister doesn't feel like your trying to turn her son against her and refuse to let her move on.\n\n (I'm not saying you are but she's a widow and a single mother and considering you tolerate her but don't seem to have any real affection for her I wonder if thats why you couldn't give her the same kindness and honesty you gave her son.

They don\u2019t even get that option when they\u2019re thrown together just before becoming family members.  It\u2019s chaotic and crazy.

We saw our bonus family members not as intruders or replacements, but as decent people trying their best, who made our loved ones happy.

You were honest with him, giving him your perspective of a similar upbringing. \n\nYour step sister asked you to help and you did; she didn\u2019t state what she wanted you to say and if she did directly tell you to say \u201cyour wrong and you should accept them\u201d that would have been vile. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want her son to be happy or care about his feelings; she only cares about herself and her image of this new family. \n\nMy wife passed when my daughter was 6 and she\u2019s 13 now. In anyone I dated, if they had kids or not, I always spoke with her honestly. I told her to just be herself; she didn\u2019t have to love them, be their friends or have any expectation other then being kind and respectful. If a real relationship between these new people would happen, it would happen organically and she would always be first in my life. I brooked no attempts at influencing her from any of these partners or their kids, and she has a healthy dynamic because of that. \n\nYou did the right thing OP. Be there for him as the voice or honesty and reason. Let your stepsister know she\u2019ll drive him away if she continues this behavior.", "NTA. He needed someone to validate him and your stepsister clearly has her own pain from your childhood which she's projecting onto her kid which isn't fair", "NTA. You told him the truth. You told him his feelings were valid. You told him that he could still come to like his Steps, even if he never came to think of them as family. \nKnowing he is allowed to feel the way he does and that he has someone he can talk to who understands that will support his mental wellbeing, and may even allow him to relax enough to maybe bond a little more than he would have if purely forced to blend in without having his real feelings acknowledged.", "NTA, we need to stop lying to children to try and show them the \"best way to live\". Life is messy and there are hard truths, but that doesn't make them any less true. Tricking kids into thinking everything always works out like a Disney movie isn't going to help them when they encounter hardships.\n\nIt sucks that your sister can cut you off from your nephew and that he'll end up going through the same BS you went through. Please try and be there for him when your sister does the whole \"idk what's wrong with him, all I ask is that he gets along with the family\" and kicks him out so she can go play house with her new family.", "NTA: She isn't hearing you, much like your mother refused to hear you. She asked for you to be honest, and you were. She didn't really want honesty, she shouldn't have asked for honest.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. I unfortunately think she's projecting her relationship with you on your son, and was under the erroneous impression that now that you are grown, you grew to regret your younger selfs decisions, when that's clearly not what happened.", "NTA. She's still butthurt that you dgaf about having them as family when you wete a child.\n\nYou did right by her son.", "NTA. You were honest with him. He'll remember that, and will respect you for it. Your stepsister was wanting you to be dishonest,  but if anyone can empathize with his feelings, it's someone who had the same experience. You did the right thing.", "NTA - Great job OP, I really hate it when parents force kids to accept some random person they like as their dad/mom. It widens the rift between them and I personally believe it weakens chances for the kids to even be friends as the one kid sees their parent get upset when the other one doesn't want to accept that parent the way they want and thinks of them as a mean person which with growth either is resolved when they both grow up or develops into hatred and they're not in each other's life anymore.", "NTA. In my experience, the easiest way to establish a relationship is to establish trust, and one of the best ways to do that is to listen to and validate someone\u2019s feelings and acknowledge them, even if you disagree. If your sister wants a more blended family, her best chance at it is to respect her son\u2019s feelings, and have her new partner and kids respect his feelings as well. That is the first step to making any sort of relationship, is to build trust. Without that, there\u2019s no way this will ever go the way she wants.", "NTA. She told you to be honest. You were. End of story. If she wanted you to lie, she should have said so. Not that you would.", "NTA.\n\nYou said what you did: Being honest and reassure him that he wasn't alone in this.\n\nYou stepsister clearly didn't notice how you felt about everything and might even have expected you to lie, potentially for your whole life whenever her son was nearby to hold up a front that doesn't exist and will fall apart in a blink of an eye.\n\nYou did well OP, be there for your stepnephew or just nephew since you seem connect so well.", "You were told to be honest. You were honest. Your nephew may have taken it a bit further by doubling down, but what he does with the information you gave him is up to him alone. NTA. But an awesome Aunt!", "Info. How old is your son? I didn't see it mentioned in the post", "NTA\n\nShe's making the same mistake that your mom and stepdad made. The mistake of not understanding that you can't force a family. And the more you try to force it, the less likely it is to happen.", "NAH\n\nDid you tell him you didn\u2019t see him as a nephew because she\u2019s not your sister? Did you tell him accepting them in his life wouldn\u2019t be disrespectful to his father?\n\nYou did right by validating what he is feeling. You did wrong by saying you would help her when you don\u2019t see her as a sister. You should have been clear to her that you don\u2019t see her as a sister, that your feelings haven\u2019t changed, and that you wouldn\u2019t tell him that being in a blended family is great.\n\nShe\u2019s out here trying to have a good life, and give him a good life, and you\u2019re here trying to make his issues with a blended family the same as yours.", "NTA. You didn't help her, you helped him, and that's a good thing.", "NTA. Bless you for being honest with that boy since everyone else just wants their way. When my dad got a new family, they really thought we\u2019d all be a family. I remember years later later my dad saying, Well there was the Brady Bunch; we thought we could do it. Truth is that you are talking about two sets of children raised by totally different people. And it probably doesn\u2019t work more than it does. Ironically, my step mother was the best parent I had, so there was that, but her kids were and remain disasters. You told your sister you were going to be honest with him & not read from her script. You\u2019re good and be there for the boy if you can.", "When will people realise that people can't change feelings?  They can change actions, but just telling someone to feel differently doesn't actually work.  If I don't feel love for someone, I can't just decide boom, that's it, I'm going to love them now.\n\nI could work towards it, and try to foster it, but I can't just change it by willing it.  This kid could be encouraged to take part in the family as much as he is comfortable with, but he can't be forced to feel like part of the whole family.  And he won't ever feel that way if they push him beyond his comfortable limits.", "Yeah, it really doesn't work the way people think it will. And a lot of kids can see when it's a lie vs the truth.", "OP's stepsister should hire an actor to read from her script. As much as I want to support my siblings, that's not my only duty or even the greater priority. The child's need is what I focus on because managing kids will happen differently from one adult to another.\n\nSo, if you just want someone to parrot your party line, you really don't want *me* at all. You want me to be you. And that's a whole bowl full of silly.", "Exactly. Validating a child\u2019s feelings is the most valuable thing one can do. The step sister is TAH.", "I disagree here, due to OP's stepsister saying OP ruined her mom's life and was trying to ruin stepsister's, too. OP was also asked to be honest, which was very clearly not what stepsister actually wanted, given that she cursed at OP over exactly that. OP's NTA, but stepsister is acting like one!", "Yeah and I think I'm the only one who really can, because I was right where he was. The only difference is my stepsister was the older of the two of us. The kids of her partner are younger and that might make things more tricky overall and might mean they try forcing him a bit more than I was. But his feelings are very familiar to me but they aren't to her because she wanted what she never really had while I didn't want to replace or find someone new for what I had lost.\n\nI do really feel for her. But I can understand her son's side a lot.", "I disagree. I feel like she is because she it seems to be that she loves that man more than her own son. It gives me that type of vibe. If she didn't, why would she push her son to accept his new stepdad and stepsiblings instead of letting it take the time it takes? Personally, i think she just jumped in way too early. Should have waited a bit longer. Her son has went through a lot and he needs space to process everything that is going on. I am not a parent so i don't wanna judge but i think that if you have kids, you owe it to them to put them first.", "> I don't really think your step sister is an AH either\n\nThis is why I can never take this sub seriously.\n\n1.

I always tell them \"hey I'm happy to carry on chatting but I need to tell your parent/aunt/uncle/grandparent what's going on because I'm worried and someone close by who loves you needs to know.

I hate to see a child being criticized for his feelings.", "I maybe would have made more of a point that he should give them a chance, though.
