That's not great friend behavior. \n\nYou are not obligated to be anyone's bridesmaid. If you agreed to do it and there was an episode she would blame you for that too. \n\nIf she is angry and unwilling to listen to your reasons and appreciate your honesty and consideration then they may not be a friend to keep around.", "NTA\nYour friends should understand and respect you.\nYou don\u2019t have to give them a reason.", "NTA at all. I have panic disorder, although after significant treatment it is almost completely under control. But if it's not? Nightmare.\n\nI don't think many people understand what an actual panic attack feels like, how overwhelming and terrifying it is, how embarrassed you feel when it's finally over. And they can hit completely out of nowhere. \n\nI think you're bring really considerate to these people (they are NOT your friends though) by not wanting to risk drawing attention away from them. And also being good to yourself, because it's significantly easier to slip out and get yourself under control privately as a guest than as part of the wedding party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They don't sound like great friends.", "NTA.  You have panic disorder and, honestly, from what I've read in this forum being a bridesmaid can be a thankless, grueling expensive ask.\n\nThat you would explain this to people who already know you have issues with anxiety in person and they would shun you tells me you need better friends.", " This is really a tough call - I think it depends on the other bridesmaid's feelings and your relationship with the bride. Maybe you should consider how it would make them feel if you weren't asked to be part of the wedding? It's not fair for you, but she might be upset too...", "NTA. Maybe to smooth it over you can ask if you can help with pre-wedding stuff, like prepping for a shower or helping plan seating or decorations. But no, you aren't under any obligation to do something that is that challenging for you.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m also neurodivergent and, although it sucks, most neurotypical people simply do not understand how debilitating a panic  disorder can be, not to mention the constant anxiety about having it rear it\u2019s ugly head at inopportune times. \n\nI\u2019m sure if you were to agree to be a bridesmaid, and did experience a panic attack during the day, or god forbid during the *ceremony* I\u2019ll bet your friend would be royally p*ssed off.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t really understand how friends close enough to you would ask you to be a bridesmaid without knowing about your panic disorder. If they aren\u2019t happy with you attending as a guest instead, are they really your friends? That seems like a totally normal compromise. Anyway, 22 is a young age for everyone in your life to be getting married\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have many more opportunities in the future to go to them if you can\u2019t tolerate them right now.", "NTA 100% and absolutely a guest has 0 obligations towards the wedding celebration, whereas so much is expected from a bridesmaid. If your friends can\u2019t understand that and how that will affect your mental health, they are the AH.", "NTA you are honest about why, and I respect that. I was recently a bridesmaid at my best friend's wedding. It was wonderful, but I essentially had an anxiety attack out if fear that I would have an anxiety attack. The difference is my friend knows me, and knows I'm sometimes a mess and wanted me there regardless, and if I run off the alter in tears mid ceremony, it wouldn't matter. \n\nI think you are doing the right thing by declining, tbh. And if they whine about being a guest and not a bridesmaid, tell them you can escape if an issue arises as a guest, but you can't just bail when you're a bridesmaid", "NTA, your friends should understand and support you in this decision. You have their best interests at heart, they don't. It's great that they asked, but as good friends they also have to understand this.", "NTA, not even a little. \n\nYou are not obliged to play the roles your \u201cfriends\u201d expect you to play. I understand they may be disappointed, and that\u2019s fine\u2026 but real friends would not only understand but care about your comfort.", "If it came down to their mental health, I wouldn't want to put that stress onto them if hypothetically- I had a wedding with bridesmaids at all. I'm fully aware of what being a bridesmaid requires, and honestly where I'm at with treatment at the moment- I don't see myself being a guarantee. It would just be added stress and pain if say I agreed, they did all this planning, and I bailed. \n\nI've apologized profusely over it. I would love to be their bridesmaid for them. But it just wouldn't be fair"]}
