He has a wife Pam (31F) and a best friend Rick (28M) since kindergarten. As long as I can remember Rick\u2019s always been around and my family\u2019s joked that he and Cole are platonic soulmates. He\u2019s invited to every family gathering, every holiday and sometimes just stays over without Cole there. Our family has welcomed SIL into the family (+ Rick) but she\u2019s a bit socially awkward and doesn\u2019t really fit in with our family. The only person she really gets along with is our mom and that\u2019s because she gets along with older ladies since she\u2019s practically one. She\u2019s a vanilla wife basically.\n\nRick\u2019s going through chemotherapy. Cole has been by his side the entire time. I don\u2019t think that SIL hated the idea but it\u2019s hard to know what she thinks. The place where Rick gets chemo is about an hour away from Cole and SIL\u2019s place. \n\nWhen Cole was at the hospital with Rick he got news that SIL had a minor car accident and asked me to check on her since I live close to the ER she was taken while he got ready to leave. \n\nI got there and SIL was recovering from the small surgery and anesthesia. She only had a few staples in her scalp and a broken arm. The doctors said she was very lucky to be so unharmed. \n\nSIL saw me and waved me over. She said \u201cTell your bro I wanna be loved. I want a divorce.\u201d and stuff about getting a gold medal in her own life. I didn\u2019t really think a lot about it since it was obvious she was still feeling the anesthesia.\n\nI called my bro and told him that SIL was fine and it was a minor surgery and the doctors said she was lucky. He was relieved and came to the hospital an hour or so later.\n\n I thought everything was fine until Cole called me the day after screaming his head off that SIL wanted to separate and I hadn\u2019t told him. Then my mom called and said SIL\u2019s side of the family was telling our side of the family that they were separating. She bit my head off for not telling anybody what SIL said. She also yelled at my brother for being with Rick instead of SIL even though she was there too. Either of them could have gone.\n\nI still think there was no point of telling them since it was clear SIL was still feeling the anesthesia. AITA?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know the details but it basically boiled down to Cole putting his family + friends before her every time. Honestly I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s talking about since Cole has always been a thoughtful, generous guy and she said that\u2019s why she fell in love with him. I think it\u2019s so sad that something that your partner loves you for is now why they hate you. She never even brought up these issues either. Cole\u2019s devasted and begged her to not leave him. \n\nEdit edit: the reason Cole was late was because Rick wasn\u2019t done with chemo and another friend was going thru a severe mental health thing so my bro had to calm her down and he couldn\u2019t do that in the car. So he was delayed getting to the hospital.

No accident that requires surgery is minor or the hospital wouldn't have you sign paperwork saying you knew something might go wrong.

He needed to finish up with his friends issues first.  Her issues second.  \n\nThe truth is that she could have died, and your brother still didn't put her above Rick's issues.  It was probably what gave clarity.  \"I'm in the hospital from an accident that the doctor said I was damn lucky to have survived... and my husband won't leave his best friends side to see me.\"  Yes, Rick is getting chemo and fighting cancer, but your brother literally ignored the emergency SIL was having (even if her injuries were \"minor\", a car accident/surgery/broken arm *are* an emergency) because of Rick's prescheduled appointment.  He should have asked you to help Rick and gone to his wife himself instead of the other way around.\n\nYour brother may be a kind person who cares about everyone, but that doesn't equate to being a good partner, a good husband.  When you have a partner, their issues become your issues.  Their pain becomes your pain.  You are supposed to support your partner, in sickness and in health.  Put them a step above others in your life (just a step or two, not a mountain above).  It sounds like your brother treats her like another one of his friends, not as a wife.

And she needed this, this time.  \n\nNow on to you, you seem very dismissive of your SIL and her feelings.  You describe her as not fitting in with your family cause she is in your words \"vanilla wife\" and socially awkward.  Just cause someone doesn't interact in social situations the way you do doesn't mean you should call her names like \"practically an old lady.\"  \n\nYou also dismiss her injuries.  Any time you have injuries that require a hospitalization, it is serious.  You say \"only had a few staples in her head\" like it's no big deal.  Staples are a huge deal, no matter how many you get.  Broken arms are a huge deal.  It may be \"minor\" as far as car accidents go, but don't minimize the fact she had to go to an ER for injuries.  \n\nYou then dismiss what she is saying.  She said straight to your face that she wanted to divorce your brother.  I dont know how more obvious you could be.  If you weren't sure, then you should have said to your brother what she said, and add the caviat that you don't know if it's serious or if it's due to anesthesia.  You are not a doctor who can determine that.  You lied to your brother that your SIL was fine when she said to your face that she wasn't fine.  That's on you.\n\nYour mother was right in chewing him out for not going to his wife.  You say either your mom or your brother could have gone, but you don't seem to understand that it was your brother's responsibility as a husband to go.  Your mom isn't married to SIL.  It also isn't her responsibility to tell her adult son to go to her side.    You say it want where your brother was needed most but honestly, it was.  It definitely was where he was needed most at that moment.  \n\nYou just don't seem to understand that and it seems to be because you don't care about her.  Maybe even dislike her.
