He has a wife Pam (31F) and a best friend Rick (28M) since kindergarten. As long as I can remember Rick\u2019s always been around and my family\u2019s joked that he and Cole are platonic soulmates. He\u2019s invited to every family gathering, every holiday and sometimes just stays over without Cole there. Our family has welcomed SIL into the family (+ Rick) but she\u2019s a bit socially awkward and doesn\u2019t really fit in with our family. The only person she really gets along with is our mom and that\u2019s because she gets along with older ladies since she\u2019s practically one. She\u2019s a vanilla wife basically.\n\nRick\u2019s going through chemotherapy. Cole has been by his side the entire time. I don\u2019t think that SIL hated the idea but it\u2019s hard to know what she thinks. The place where Rick gets chemo is about an hour away from Cole and SIL\u2019s place. \n\nWhen Cole was at the hospital with Rick he got news that SIL had a minor car accident and asked me to check on her since I live close to the ER she was taken while he got ready to leave. \n\nI got there and SIL was recovering from the small surgery and anesthesia. She only had a few staples in her scalp and a broken arm. The doctors said she was very lucky to be so unharmed. \n\nSIL saw me and waved me over. She said \u201cTell your bro I wanna be loved. I want a divorce.\u201d and stuff about getting a gold medal in her own life. I didn\u2019t really think a lot about it since it was obvious she was still feeling the anesthesia.\n\nI called my bro and told him that SIL was fine and it was a minor surgery and the doctors said she was lucky. He was relieved and came to the hospital an hour or so later.\n\n I thought everything was fine until Cole called me the day after screaming his head off that SIL wanted to separate and I hadn\u2019t told him. Then my mom called and said SIL\u2019s side of the family was telling our side of the family that they were separating. She bit my head off for not telling anybody what SIL said. She also yelled at my brother for being with Rick instead of SIL even though she was there too. Either of them could have gone.\n\nI still think there was no point of telling them since it was clear SIL was still feeling the anesthesia. AITA?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know the details but it basically boiled down to Cole putting his family + friends before her every time. Honestly I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s talking about since Cole has always been a thoughtful, generous guy and she said that\u2019s why she fell in love with him. I think it\u2019s so sad that something that your partner loves you for is now why they hate you. She never even brought up these issues either. Cole\u2019s devasted and begged her to not leave him. \n\nEdit edit: the reason Cole was late was because Rick wasn\u2019t done with chemo and another friend was going thru a severe mental health thing so my bro had to calm her down and he couldn\u2019t do that in the car. So he was delayed getting to the hospital.

No accident that requires surgery is minor or the hospital wouldn't have you sign paperwork saying you knew something might go wrong.

Not wait for chemo to finish and calm someone else down. His wife was in the hospital and had surgery, no matter how \u201cminor\u201d (according to you) it was. I can understand why she wants a divorce because this the straw that broke her back.\n\nNta for not saying anything.", "If your mom was also at the chemo session why couldn\u2019t your bro go and look after his wife after the session\u2026your NTA for not telling what you thought was anaesthesia coz it hardly would have changed what your SIL is feeling. \n\nBut your bro is definitely the AH. He\u2019s not a doctor to triage and decide his wife is not the priority, he\u2019s her husband and the expectation is she\u2019s the priority.", "Your dislike for Pam and your love for your brother and Rick are really clouding your judgement here. Your brother should have gotten his ass in the car as soon as he heard about his wife being in an accident. He prioritized his friends over her, and that, in a marriage, is doing something wrong.", "He didn't show up when she needed him. I wouldn't say that isn't doing anything wrong. \n\nIf I had just been in a car accident and my husband didn't drop everything to get to me I'd be pissed. \n\nI'm guessing this isn't the first time she is pushed down the pecking order of whose most important to your brother. I guess he doesn't exactly cherish his wife. He left her alone after surgery.", "Well, to your SIL, being neglected IS doing wrong. You decide what you're willing to accept from a partner, she's decided the same for herself. Her needs aren't being met, period. And honestly his relationship is his business and his problem. The way you're all jumping in as though ANY of your opinions matter here, makes me side with SIL. Y'all are cringey af", "You keep saying this over and over as this explains anything. Your brother put his wife at the bottom of his priority list. There\u2019s a difference between being thoughtful and neglecting his primary relationship with his wife. Your brother put his wife last for so long that she\u2019s got sick of it. If your brother wants to maintain a relationship with anyone, he needs to learn how to better prioritise those who should be most important to him. Your NTA for playing messenger, but stop defending your brother\u2019s actions because he was TA.", "Nope spouse trumps all else. He should have been with his wife. He chose her to be his life partner and now he is losing her because he didn\u2019t put her first. You don\u2019t triage when it comes to spouse and friends. Spouse wins. Every time.", "You know even going under for anesthesia is actually pretty risky, right? How would he feel if she had a bad reaction to the anesthesia and didn't pull through? Did it ever cross his mind that she was just in an accident and likely scared as well as injured? Why would she want the person who clearly doesn't like her there with her during that (you absolutely were judgemental and kind of mean in your description of her- zero chance that doesn't translate to real life, as an fyi)?\n\nYou keep parroting the same lines but don't understand none of that makes him a good husband. From the wife's perspective, he's absolutely TA. None of this was actually ok.\n\nAnd if he's unwilling to prioritize his spouse, he should never have gotten married in the first place", "And his wife was having a physical health crisis and wife > friend. You keep saying her I juries were minor, but have you ever been in a car wreck? They\u2019re pretty traumatizing. Cole didn\u2019t prioritize his wife, so now he won\u2019t have one. NTA for not relaying the message\u2014it wouldn\u2019t have been your place to do that even if she hadn\u2019t had anesthesia.", "This is just incorrect. Your brother is not a doctor, he didn\u2019t need to triage anyone, his wife should ALWAYS come first. Period. You both have your priorities mixed way up.", "And his wife was in the hospital after a car accident! No wonder she doesn\u2019t feel loved when she\u2019s literally the least important to him in a scary situation. ESH except SIL", "Sorry, nothing against you, but no.\n\nIf I were his wife I wouldn\u2019t be happy and it seems this isn\u2019t the first time that she\u2019s third+ tier rated by her husband.\n\nMental health crises suck. He could have said \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, you have to call someone else or a hotline as my wife just got in a wreck and I\u2019m in the hospital with her.\u201d He prioritized just in this one instance 2 people before his wife.", "For your question - NTA - not your job to be a go between\n\nFor your inability to understand that when one person marries another that person and the family they are creating comes before friends having mental breakdowns and friends that are like brothers having chemo - y t a and your whole family TA", "So he prioritized a female friend over his wife while she was in the hospital, and you don't see the problem?\n\nHe should have sent you or mum to the friend if he was that worried, not to his wife.\n\nYou marry the person you want to be your family. If you can't put the family you chose first, you kinda don't deserve  it", "Hard no. Friends do not come before spouse especially when spouse was just in an accident. She broke her arm. She was likely scared/shaken up, in pain, and needed support, but her husband was too busy supporting his friends. \n\nYou are NTA for not saying anything to him. You are TA for defending his behavior and describing her as vanilla and the other parts basically calling her old and boring. She's just been in a wreck and you are downplaying that and being derogatory. Yta for that.", "No he can just blame himself", "Sounds like there is more to her side of the story that you might not know.  Maybe she is jealous of Rick and feels like he gets the attention that she needs.  Either way, this is her dilemma and not yours.  If she wants to tell you, then that is on her.  It isn\u2019t your place to have to but in as it is her happiness on the line.  Let her deal with it as she sees fit.  \n\nEven if you had told your brother, the situation is the same.  She wants out.  That is on her and not your place to have to break the news to Cole.", "Cole loves Rick. Cole and Rick have a happy marriage, the wife is a beard.", "She had an accident that led to surgery and he arrived an hour AFTER the surgery. He didn't put her first when she really needed it. This is years of her not being put first by her husband capped off by him not even bothering to come to the hospital with any sense of urgency. Instead he sent you. Did anyone even ask her if she wanted you there or is it just accepted that since she is \"vanilla\" she will just put up with her husband's terrible behavior and choices?", "Mebbe lol", "Yep. I had 6 rounds of traditional chemo plus 12 additional infusions. Followed that with 30 rounds of radiation.\n\nDay one - yep - I appreciated having my husband with me because it was scary. Even then, I slept through most of the day. After day one, I only appreciated a companion to help with the boredom - again, when I didn\u2019t sleep through the infusions.", "The part that got me was she gets along with mom and the older ladies because she practically is one.  Practically is one at 31 Jesus.", "He does. He loves her so much. He just had to triage and it sucked for him because he had no idea SIL has a problem with who he was", "All of this. He wasn\u2019t there when she really needed him. That\u2019s a deal-breaker for a lot of people. And really, what good is a spouse if you can\u2019t count on them when it really matters?", "Trust me a mental health hotline wouldn\u2019t have helped. Only Cole is good at that kinda stuff", "It\u2019s kinda homophobic that you think two dudes who are best friends are gay\n\nFor the record both of them are straight.", "No but I was the closest person so I could give him an update. I swear he was really worried but Rick gets really weak after chemo + another friend has been going thru a severe mental health crisis and needed his support so when you triage it SIL needed the least help at the time", "Seriously- so much is resting or sleeping because of any meds delivered w the chemo. You need help to get down to a vehicle and be driven home afterwards, the rest is just general companionship which isn\u2019t more important than a spouse in surgery! \n\nHope you are well now hiketheworld50 \u2764\ufe0f", "I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I meant she had old lady tendencies and hobbies. J", "He's taken her for granted. You keep saying triage like it's some get out of jail free card. He felt his friends needed him more than his wife did. \n\nSo now she's triaging herself and putting her needs at the top. She's just found out that when she wakes up from surgery her husband won't put her physical and emotional needs before his friends. She's woken up to find out she doesn't mean as much to her husband as he does to her, and it's probably broken her. \n\nYou like to keep saying what she went through wasn't that bad, the drs said it could be worse. Well, yes! She could have died and her husband was more interested in helping his friends through stuff than getting to her side. Did you think that that could be what's going through her mind? \"I could have died and he didn't care\". And you're surprised she wants a divorce? \n\nYou weren't wrong to not say anything, again you didn't know how aware she was but clearly she meant what she said about wanting to feel loved.", "This isn\u2019t about \u201cwho he is.\u201d You can be kind and supportive and giving to the people around you without emotionally and physically neglecting your spouse. The reality is that he took her for granted and was so busy being there for other people that he wasn\u2019t there for the person who should\u2019ve been his number one priority. \n\nHe did need to triage, and the number one on his triage should always be his wife. You already said your mom was also at the chemo session, so he wasn\u2019t needed there, and if his friend was going through a mental health crisis, then that should have been handled by a mental health professional or by a different friend or loved one who didn\u2019t currently have a spouse in the hospital. He seems to have a savior complex, but when he\u2019s so busy playing the hero for other people, then he\u2019s not going to be around to save his own relationship. \n\nBut regardless, this has nothing to do with you, so it\u2019s not your fault for not saying anything. But you\u2019re not doing him any favors by continuing to idealize his behaviors and act like she\u2019s the problem. She\u2019s not.", "No, he didn't HAVE to \"triage.\"  He chose to prioritize other people above his wife, and sounds like it's not the first time.  She's clearly had enough, and I don't blame her.  I hope she finds someone else who will love her the way she deserves because it isn't your brother.", "He never makes her his priority. He is and has been doing something wrong over and over again. He puts everyone else before her. The fact that he failed to realize there was a problem is just further proof of his failure as a husband/partner.", "Your brother is a neglectful jackass to his wife. He faafo.", "anyone married who has their priorities right will triage as follows:\nTheir family (wife and kids)\nTheir outer family (parents, siblings etc)\nClose friends (Rick and the person having a breakdown)\nDistant family\nCoworkers, other acquaintances etc.\n\nSee how your brother is putting different people at his top? It is sweet he wants to help people but you can't help everyone all the time and the person you say you love more than anyone on earth, enough to marry and build a life with, should come before friends. Chemo is a routine practice and your mum was there. He should've been running to his wife. End of story.\n\nEDIT: typos", "HE DID NOT HAVE TO TRIAGE - HE CHOSE TO...be very very clear on that...there was NO gun to his head, he wasn't the Dr for all three people HE DID NOT NEED TO TRIAGE \\_ HE CHOSE TO...that may very well be his personality, But HE made the judgement call and he CHOSE to put his wife last...they were his choices...he now has to live with the consequences of what appears to be consistently de-prioritising his wife", "Perhaps if he spent time with her he could have showed her but he took her for granted and put her last. He is able to be the nice guy to everyone but her and she is supposed to just be thankful for whatever remaining sliver or crumb that\u2019s left over. That\u2019s not a marriage of partners. There is nothing worse than loving someone that chooses everyone in the room before you", "Ummm is Cole sleeping with her? Is that the relief his friend needed?\n\nWeird vibes all around. In a true mental health crisis Cole could have called 911 worst case scenario and his friend would have been admitted to the hospital to protect her from herself.", "Is a licensed therapist?  I'd say definitely not because a trained professional would have better priorities.\n\nI'm willing to bet he did get a license to marry Pam and then he took an oath under that license to be there for her.\n\nShe wants to be his VIP all the time and she realized that she will never even make the list temporarily.", "Mental health hotlines (if they are good) are training to help. Anyone. With whatever issue they have. If she needed him specifically I think that says more of the relationship between them. NTA for not saying anything and I don\u2019t blame Pam.", "So Cole has an unshakeable dedication to everyone in his life except his wife", "Well when you look at it that way. Cole should also be good with the divorce since he seems so good with stuff", "I see nothing whatsoever negative about being gay. Your insisting that \"no way they are!\", as in that's a bad thing to say about someone, shows *you* to be the homophobe.", "SIL is his wife. And this is why he will soon be divorced. She wants someone who will actually bother to care enough about her in an actual emergency. Triage it? This is his WIFE. Your mom was there for Rick and the other friend should not come before the woman he swore to stand by for the rest of his life.", "you know who was also probably going through a mental health crisis? The woman who left her house, got into a car accident, had to go to the hospital and have emergency surgery to then wake up to find out her husband was too busy helping others to show up and sent his sister whom Im sure she can tell doesnt really like her to send him an update. That would be pretty freaking mentally traumatizing for most people, but yeah keep making excuses for your Saint of a brother.", "Wording is important. You said she practically is an old lady not has those tendencies", "Yikes. Your brother apparently liked her old lady tendencies before because he married her. And you are very unkind.", "No? Why does everyone think Cole is sleeping with all his friends? He\u2019s just that kinda guy. \n\nA few weeks ago my dad pulled a muscle and Cole came over and without a word mowed the lawn and organized the garage that my dad wanted to do for weeks.", "I\u2019m literally bi.", "His friend was going through a MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. She needed him at the moment. \n\nSIL was fine and we were all looking after her.", "But he\u2019s not \u201cthat kinda guy\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s the kinda guy who lets his wife down when she\u2019s been in an accident severe enough to send her to the hospital and require pain meds.\n\nHe\u2019s apparently busy being there for everyone but the person he swore an oath to", "I don\u2019t think Cole is sleeping with Rick, or your dad.\n\nI do think this friend thing is sus. Again, I\u2019m not attacking you at all, this is just from your OP and comments.\n\nBest case scenario/conclusion I can come to is Cole doesn\u2019t value his wife as much as he values the rest of his friends and family. Which isn\u2019t good.\n\nWorst case is Cole is getting a little something on the side. Also not good.\n\nBottom line is SIL is completely justified feeling unloved and unwanted.", "Sounds like Cole wasn't ready to be a husband and have a wife. \nHe will learn this the hard way since no one around seems to acknowledge that his marriage wasn't a priority in his \"good guy\" schedule.", "Oh so your brother can prioritise people JUST NOT HIS WIFE\n\nYou are NTA for not saying anything, but you and your family are a'holes for diminishing your SIL and her feelings", "Op you are coming off as incesty in your defense of your brother. Major Lannister vibes here.", "Well, Pam will be single soon. Too bad you can't stand her! But she'd be better off getting far away from your deep in denial family.", "His wife was going through a MEDICAL EMERGENCY. She had surgery, she was in an accident. She needed her husband. Your brother is an AH. Period. \n\nYes, people should be there for their friends but not at the cost of their marriage or their spouse's sense of security or love. Your brother should have jumped up immediately and headed to the hospital. Again, this is why he will be divorced soon. And yes, he deserves it.", "Then he needs to call actual mental health experts to help her through it because that is not his wife, and if he cannot  safely leave this person alone to even be with his wife after an accident, this person likely needs serious medical help. Does your brother have a savior complex or something? He should not be the main support system for this person if he has to ditch his family to do it. Once he married SIL, she was supposed to be his family", "Once again, it was MINOR. \n\nSIL knew he was a generous loving person. Why is she choosing to punish him for being the person she married and loved?", "A broken arm and staples in the head (along with a likely concussion) are not minor. She realized he wasn't ever going to be there for her. He was generous to everyone but her. \n\nIt seems you are just stuck on blaming her for your brother's shortcomings as a husband. In the end, you were good not to tell him what she said but it is also pretty obvious he is incapable of self-reflection or self-awareness. Defending him isn't going to help his next spouse. He needs to know where he went wrong.", "Because he is all those things OTHER ppl but her. When she needed him most he wasn\u2019t there. Period.", "You are a seriously unreliable narrator lmao", "Ice cold. What a terrible family", "Her description of SIL is major shit.  Gets along with mom because she gets along with all older ladies because she practically is one.  She is 31 op is 24.  A basic vanilla wife.  Jesus."]}
