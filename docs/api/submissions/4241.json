You already know that your mum has a problem adjusting to new you but its HER problem, not yours.", "It is completely understandable that you would want to boost your confidence and feel more comfortable and attractive when you are around your cousins. You are not an asshole for wanting to feel more confident and for using makeup to help you achieve that.\r  \n\r  \nIt was not fair of your mother to ask you not to wear makeup or to \"not be too pretty\" in order to avoid making your cousin insecure. Your appearance and your confidence are not something that you should have to sacrifice in order to protect your cousin's feelings. You should be able to express yourself and feel good about yourself without worrying about how it will affect others.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, it is not your responsibility to make your cousin feel secure or to protect her from feeling threatened by others. She is an adult and should be able to handle her own insecurities and feelings of competition. It is not fair to expect you to change your behavior in order to protect her from feeling uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nIt is also important to remember that your worth as a person is not determined by your appearance or by how attractive others find you. You should not let the opinions of others dictate how you feel about yourself or how you present yourself to the world. You are a valuable and worthy person regardless of how others perceive you.", "Maybe the secret here was that you were actually beautiful all along and the confidence makeup gave you us what changed.\n\nNTA.

What next, you will srart being excluded from every family gathering because your cousin feel more comfortable having 'ugly duckling' next to her to look preety?\n\nI had classmates in college who were typical 'good looking' girls - make up, nice clothes, fit etc. and they somehow always had these unnatractive, usually bigger girls to hang out with - it was always my theory this was to make themselves look better.", "Your mum has just validated you -- you must be looking great. Congratulations. \n\nGet used to this feeling of unease. A lot of people who are conventionally attractive base a sense of superiority on the unattractiveness of those around them. It's disgusting. But you will likely feel this amongst your family and friends as you learn to present yourself better and better in your own way, and feel more and more confident. Others will see this as a threat to their own identity and image. Again, it's disgusting. But you will have to learn to ride that sentiment from others. \n\nNobody NOBODY can ever take away your right to look and feel amazing. You do you. It is NOT YOUT JOB to cater to other people's insecurities - especially if they have not even been expressed by said person. \n\nCONGRATULATIONS on no longer feeling like an ugly duckling. I hope you continue to feel more and more comfortable in your skin and attractive in general.", "NTA but feel like a bit of a back handed compliment in reverse.

Can\u2019t you just be you and feel ok like you are? Brands don\u2019t make beauty. Makeup neither, nor clothes. Imo at least. \n\nThe confidence I find ok though.
