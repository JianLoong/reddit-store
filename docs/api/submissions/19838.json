Assuming the car you had already planned to rent was a 2 rows kind of car (since you would have your baby with you), there's been no additional expense to accommodate your mom anyway and with your sister having her own car. \nHaving two more people (his mom and sister) would make it too crowded in the back and you would've had to rent a larger car, which by your comment would be an extra $300. Whether you rent a larger car or an additional car, it's gonna cost money. Why can't your mom ride in your sister's car so that his mom and sister can ride in your's? Or have his mom and sister split up so one ride in yours and the other rides in your sister's. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f that way you won't have to spending money upgrading or renting another car.
