Assuming the car you had already planned to rent was a 2 rows kind of car (since you would have your baby with you), there's been no additional expense to accommodate your mom anyway and with your sister having her own car. \nHaving two more people (his mom and sister) would make it too crowded in the back and you would've had to rent a larger car, which by your comment would be an extra $300.

Rent a bigger car orrr 9 people for  10 spaces seems good to me.  Also this is YOUR vacation so anyone encroaching or trying to boss you into their way is not cool. Good luck but have fun and that is really a non issue in the grand scheme.", "It's not exactly fair to say no then change your mind. THEN wanting to stay in a couples room for free, THEN saying they'd don't want to spend their money on a car after saying they aren't going. THEN just inviting another person. Dude why are you nothing sub if this is your concept of fair?", "Yeah, but MIL should pay the difference.", "How about the fact that MIL did want to go until she heard op Mom was going.", "So she should fork over 300 bucks for the upgrade? And yes op confirmed that's what the upgrade costs. Why can't Mil cover that?", "I looked at your comments and profile; I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t been banned yet. Almost 12,000 karma points for only nasty comments. I think YTA. Get some therapy loser.", "Yes, compromise by renting a bigger car, but they can not stay in your room.", "Make sure that each mom picks up dinner one night to compensate for the car being your expense.", "Found the MIL!", "You\u2019re a saint. It\u2019s not like you wanted any of them to impose upon you. This is already going to be a nightmare without having people in your space too. I feel bad people have \u201cchoice words\u201d for you because you definitely don\u2019t deserve that. Still, you are taking the criticism very well and seem to be a compassionate and generous person.", "Ops mom didn't expect to stay in her hotel room. And Mil didn't want to go until she heard op Mom was going.", "Can the teenager go with your sister, BIL and the little ones and sit between the carseats, then your MIL go with you, your husband,  mom and the baby? Maybe upgrade to a small SUV or larger sedan for both so it's not super squishy, but probably cheaper than upgrading to a minivan.", "Can you give her the kids and the baby and just have a nice calm adult car? That would be pretty nice hahaha", "Depending on the size of the cars eats that middle seat is probably not usable by even a teenager. Plus Sister/family are at a different hotel. I wonder how close thar hotels are if OP is going to be picking up her mom who is in the same place as sister?\n\nAlso, I agree with everyone saying get a larger car, however the cost of rentals has gone wild the past few years, there might not be an suv or minivan available and it will cost quite a bit *probably less than 2 cars but not necessarily). I think OP should call to see if the upgrade is possible, if so see the price difference. Then ask her husband/MIL to help cover the difference in cost.", "That\u2019s a pretty fair compromise!", "Not just 1 extra person, 3 extra. Sis has 2 kids.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! They should have just had a party. This is going to be an absolute nightmare trip. Good luck!", "OP did it to themselves.", "Info: why can\u2019t your MIL just ride with you two/ baby and your mom/sister/2 kids are in the other rental? \n\nEither way your own sister is gonna rent a car anyway. This way there would be 4 people in your sisters car (your mom/sis/ 2 kids) and 4 people in yours (you/ husband/baby/ MIL). \n\nHonestly I feel like you\u2019re being a little extra about the seating arrangements in the car.", "YTA\n\nJust rent a bigger car,  problem solved everyone is happy. Shoot for that matter,  have your Sis pitch in and rent a 15 passenger van. Then you're all together, unless sis wants to have the freedom to come and go as she pleases with her kids.  I hope you have fun on your trip. Happy first year! \ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf8a\ud83e\udd73", "I had a 6 person rental car situation recently, just upgrade to the mini van or an enclave or something.  Not really that extra expensive.\n\nThey should definitely get their own room though, piling on to someone else's vacation where you expect them to finance the trip is a-hole territory.", "NTA but a big van sounds like an idea. Also, not having all the in-laws. Yuck.", "Omg omg omg I fucking hate all of this. A sweet simple family trip turns into a clusterfuck because too many people are latching on to the trip teet. \n\nMy parents try this shit all the time. The snark, \" thanks for the invite\" guilt trip nonsense. Drives me nuts. \n\nThen they sit like lumps expecting me to do everything, pay for everything. \n\nI started saying NO. \n\nYou are not entitled to my vacation. You are not entitled to an invite. My car. My rental. My hotel. My peace. \n\nThat's not what all of this is about but it just hit me. Ugh. \n\nIf one half of the mom train is latching on then the other mom has to be allowed to latch on. Rent a bigger car. Set better boundaries in the future if you want to avoid this shit. \n\nWe don't tell people we travel until afterwards, these days. It avoids the hassle.", "Yasss OP understood the assignment! We love to see it!", "And you might have gone down the wrong path, so to speak, when MIL and SIL wanted to stay in your hotel room. That would've definitely put me off regarding any future requests from them!", "If only everyone inquiring here could be so open to their judgment!", "Tell your mother and mother in law to split their own rental car? Or do they not get along.", "A group this size and related in this way needs two vehicles. This has disaster written all over it.", "Agreed. All those people and there are already hints of competitiveness brewing. They are going to fight over activities, where to eat, when to get ready to go on the activities, etc. She is going to try to side with her family. He will try to side with his. Group vacations can be fun when everyone is on the same page. These people aren\u2019t even in the same novel.", "I still think it is VERY odd and entitled for MIL and hubby to even THINK that they should stay in the OP's hotel room.", "Definitely not the same travel guide!", "You typing \u201cIYKYK\u201d is why YTA", "Possible ESH. You\u2019re bordering on being TA for not at least trying to problem-solve a little (lots of people pointing out you could rent a bigger car), but at the same time she\u2019s being a bigger asshole by just expecting you to accommodate 100%. She should\u2019ve first asked if it would be possible to rent a bigger car, and inviting herself and a teenager into your hotel room is totally out of line. I\u2019m a big believer in \u201cyou do for family,\u201d so I think you should try and make it work, but it sounds like she\u2019s being incredibly entitled so I get your frustration.", "NTA. Had it been a group plan from the beginning, yes, you would be the AH. But since she added on only bc your family is going, and she has a teenager, so she needs her own space.", "You made a mistake ever to have encouraged anyone to tag along on your vacation. You got this mess started.\n\nBut who are these bizarre relatives who just invite themselves on your vacation, or who get snooty when you don't ask them to come along and try to make you feel guilty?  Invite them out.\n\nMore importantly, you need to put this petty dictator you married in his place. Tell him you want to cancel the vacation for everyone but the three of you.  If he makes a stink about not wanting to disappoint his mother, cancel everything and set up a vacation for yourself and your baby without him.  If he tries to prevent it, tell him to step aside, or you will file for a divorce so he can marry his mother.\n\nDon't repeat your errors the next time you have a vacation coming up.  You are not obligated to provide vacations for the rest of humanity.", "Yta", "Your first mistake was telling ur Mom and sister they could come. You thought they were joking. You should have said this trip was for you, husband, and toddler.\nDon't you even know your family?", "NTA at all.\nIt\u2019s a 5 seater car. If MIL wants a ride, that\u2019s fine, she can be squashed in the back with OP\u2019s mum and bub. That\u2019s fair - both mums in the car.\nBUT if MIL wants to take her daughter as well then they should find their own transport - just like OP\u2019s sister. \nHow old is this teenage sister? Is she old enough to drive?", "NTA.  Tell him.  \"I will be hurt.  But the baby and I are going.  You can stay if you want.  But we are going.  Your mom won't be in the car with us.  End of story.\"", "YTA\u2026get a bigger car.  Your mom and sister are going, but his mom and sister can\u2019t go?  That\u2019s a witchy move.  I understand the room sharing I would not that either, so they need to get their own room, but just rent a bigger car to fit everyone.", "Rent a van but everybody needs to book their own room.  Your room needs to be a space you can go back to and get away from everybody and relax.  I think that getting a van but they get their own room is a good compromise.  \n\nAnd if that isn\u2019t good enough for your husband then he can share a room with his mom and sister, and you and your child can get your own room. Or leave the husband, his mom, and sister at home.", ">Renting a bigger car would be significantly easier and cheaper than a whole extra car\n\nwould it? whenever i needed to rent minivan, it was always 4x the price of a regular car.", "Hahaha. You\u2019re not wrong. Noted.", "Most sane r/amitheasshole AH", "NTA. This woman wants to be and sleep in YOUR hotel room with her teenage daughter. 5 people crowded in one room. No freaking way. She\u2019s a bloody cheapskate and leech. Why is she coming if she doesn\u2019t have any money ??? \n\nWhat does your husband say? Is mommy and sissy sleeping in the same room as him? If they are, cancel the vacation and book a room in the same hotel as your sister. Because this reeks of unhealthy family dynamics. \n\nNTA.", "IKR? I'm really impressed by OP.", "MIL didn't want to come until she found out that OP's mom was coming. Then she expected to stay in OP's hotel room and be chauffeured in OP's rental car free of charge. I'd be mad too, as would most people. She's being needlessly competitive and inconveniencing everyone to do so.", "I don't even know how old you are but I can tell you are wise beyond your years.", "Pretty sure she said it\u2019s her sister that has 2 kids.", "You started this whole thing by letting your family muscle in on your vacation. Now it\u2019s snowballed. Cancel everything and go back to your original plan, maybe make a long term plan for extended family vacation some other time when there\u2019s time to plan properly and save", "I had a conference in Vegas once with 8 other people. They all wanted to use Uber until they had to pay at least $20 per trip from our location to the strip. I had rented a minivan. Charged each person $25 and it paid for the rental. We set up a time to leave our location and a time to return. \nThat being said, just get a bigger vehicle. It would be fair if they did chip in though.", "NTA. MIL didn't even want to come until she found our your mother is and she was entitled enough to say she wanted to stay in your room, does she not have ANY boundaries??", "You might be wrong about the car but NOT the room. Don\u2019t let them encroach on your room.\u2764\ufe0f", "Read her post again. Her sister has rented her own car with her husband and their 2 kids. It\u2019s ONLY her mom who\u2019s gonna be in the same rental car as OP. So her family does NOT get to share her rental car.", "Yeah she should 100% stay at home and cancel the vacation. Because which normal and sane adult woman would agree to share a hotel room with her MIL and SIL. Sounds like her in-laws are broke or just disgusting leeches.", "Love to rent minivans on vacation. Have three kids and it\u2019s so convenient.  Hate minivans other than vacations.", "Not me tho, I am different."]}
