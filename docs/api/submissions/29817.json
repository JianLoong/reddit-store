If they need money they should have asked for it, not take it from the funeral fund. Those who donated did so for the funeral, nothing else. To give it to them would have been fraud.", "NTA\n\nYou specifically earmarked the money as funeral expense.  Instead of being appreciative they tried to steal the money and spend absolutely little as possible for actual funeral.\n\nWith that kind of attitude, I hope you permanently stop associating with them in the future.", "NTA. Those little sh*ts can take advantage of someone else. It was kind of you to set up the fund and to think of charity with the rest. It was kind of those who donated. These parasites wanted to take advantage of their father\u2019s death?! Balls to them! Kudos to you for standing by your principles and for refunding the donors", "NTA.\n\nThey asked for funds on a funeral and received those, if they wanted something to help with their situation, they should've asked for that instead. You can't play on the goodwill of people and get away with it for your own interests.", "NTA \n\nGoFundMe has been in lawsuits before due to people lying about why they need help and then wasting the money. They have the right to audit now and show proof that the funds were not scammed from donors. OP might have gotten into trouble at some point for using the leftover funds as donations.", "Having just cremated my dad, there is more cost involved in a funeral than the $275 church service. The last expensive place to have him cremated was still charging $1500 for that service. What did they think would happen to the body after the church service that they wouldn\u2019t have to pay any more?", "Hell  not NTA -   What they wanted to do is literal Fraud .  Cut both of them off.", "People donated for a purpose,  and paying rent for the children was not it. As someone who has run GFM for a dogs' charity, I feel strongly that if you ask people for money you are responsible for the integrity of how it is spent. \n\nYour relatives have become greedy. This was not intended or asked for as spending money for them. Personally I would close the GFM and ask them to refund everyone who has donated. Let them sort the funeral themselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA - No good deed goes unpunished\u2026huh? I\u2019m sorry for your loss and that your niblings are acting  so horribly.", "Has everyone checked into the full cost of funeral/memorial service, plus either burial and casket, or cremation?  When my mom passed away it was still almost $2,000 to have her cremated and that was 20 years ago so I imagine it's more than that now.", "They could, you know, get a job in order to make rent.

Usually it is \"covers funeral expenses and the rest goes to support the family in their time of loss\"?", "How old are the kids? It\u2019s pretty common for gofundme\u2019s to be applied to the living expenses of the unexpected departed\u2019s dependents. Usually  funeral gofundme\u2019s have a line that states that excess funds will go towards basic family expenses as they adjust to losing the departed. Did you discuss the gofundme with the kids prior to starting it?", "I think YTA for setting up a go fund me with the excess funds going to charity instead of the family. I understand people might not agree but that is what most people I know do especially if the deceased had children. And how are you going to have your own wake if you\u2019re not the Next of Kin?Plus funeral expenses including a church are way more than $275( I work at a funeral home) the $275 maybe just for a priest or venue rental, not the entire bill so this has me thinking you are a unreliable narrator. Great job stressing out an already grieving family that you are not even blood related to.", "INFO Did you ask them prior to setting up this fund whether they wanted a go fund me and if so, what their financial needs were?", "YTA. They lost their dad who they relied on. You're family. Why are you being so cold-hearted? You said the rest would go to charity - isn't giving the money to the people who lost their provider, so they would have a few month to organise - charity? That they souldn't have to look for places to stay while they mourn after just loosing their dad? If the ledt-over afetr the setvice I donated to was going to the struggling relatives of the deceased whom he supported - I would consider it the charity I was promised it would go to.\n\nYou're their uncle, they lost their dad. I think you wers super AH here.", "If you created the go fund me for funds to be given to them, then You're wrong and can get in so much trouble for not handing over every penny to her/them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry for their loss, but they were quick to cheap out their Father's funeral so they could illegally cash in!! OP- very lovely of you to host a Wake, and to return the unused $.  N/C is definitely the way to go with those 2 kids for sure! NTA", "INFO: How old are the kids? Did you talk to them about setting it up?

How did someone who engendered your loyalty raise such horrible grasping children?", "NTA they wanted you to commit fraud and then falsely reported you for fraud. Also, do they not realize that their fathers estate is now responsible for the funeral costs or whoever signed the agreement at the mortuary is now responsible for those costs. They still didn't get rent money, they don't have the gofundme and they added more debt, they aren't the brightest are they?", "Nta", "The way they had the audacity to report the GoFundMe for fraud because OP wouldn\u2019t commit fraud\u2026I know they just lost their father, so they have my condolences there.

That they would want to spend next to nothing on the funeral and pocket most of it.", "I'm sure had OP known beforehand that their rental costs were funded by their dad and would thus face financial struggles, the gofundme would have been set up differently. If funeral costs were the thing they raised as struggling with, then that is what was being provided.", "Same. I think most people would\u2019ve donated to help the family out. At least that\u2019s how it was for me when my husband passed. It sounds like the kids are adults but if they were minors, setting up SS survivors benefits takes time\u2026..like a lot of time\u2026..so any help to tide them over until those benefits kick in is essential.", "???  They said it was stated it was for the funeral with any remainder going to charity so clearly not.", "why don't you re read the post one more time instead of making something up to instigate a fight . get well soon . \ud83d\ude09", "I am certain that both the people donating for the father's funeral and the father himself would rather see his living children taken care of than a lavish expensive funeral. That is what you usually see on such go fund me pages - especially ones where the father and main provider of the household had passed away - even if the mom is in the picture and working the switch from 2 salaries to 1 can have devastating consequences for the family's accommodation, healthcare, loans if they have car or mortgage. \n\nWhy did the sister set up the page if she wasn't aware of their financial situation or didn't talk with them at all. It can be as easily said that she could be the one profiting since she is managing the go fund me and how many people woyld audit a funeral expenses fund?", "Why did OP set up the go fund me without consulting or involving the immediate family?", "I don't take from the post, that no conversation was had. It seems to me that they spoke and the pressing concerns were the funeral costs. As OP states, the children was appreciative of the support until they realised the amount raised. I'm inclined to believe that perhaps they didn't understand/think that this level of support would be available and once they realised the amount raised, thought they would get it all. Either way, they aren't entitled to the funds just because they want it. Clearly the whole family had been affected by the loss of OPs brother and I'd say it's very rare for anyone to be rational/think straight 100% of the time when facing bereavement like this. But clearly the funeral isn't their main concern if they later decided for the cheapest option thinking they could pocket the remaining+5k. That's just downright scabby"]}
