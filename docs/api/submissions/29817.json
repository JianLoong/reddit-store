It seems to me that they spoke and the pressing concerns were the funeral costs. As OP states, the children was appreciative of the support until they realised the amount raised. I'm inclined to believe that perhaps they didn't understand/think that this level of support would be available and once they realised the amount raised, thought they would get it all. Either way, they aren't entitled to the funds just because they want it. Clearly the whole family had been affected by the loss of OPs brother and I'd say it's very rare for anyone to be rational/think straight 100% of the time when facing bereavement like this. But clearly the funeral isn't their main concern if they later decided for the cheapest option thinking they could pocket the remaining+5k.

Every damn person who donated did so in support of the family, I guarantee they didn\u2019t care where exactly the $ went as long as it went to help the family. Grief does crazy things to people but you gate keeping the funds so that this man\u2019s children may lose their housing is petty and your virtue signaling is disgusting. \n\nBe KIND. Jesus. I\u2019ve held a Go Fund Me for the exact same reason for a friend who died that received way more $ than anyone thought it would. Did I gatekeep how the family spent the $?!?! No. I just gladly handed it over and hoped it helped ease some of their stress.", "NTA but not sure how they thought they were going to get away with just a $275 charge for the church - most funeral costs are for the funeral home, embalming, casket, gravesite and stone.

Absolutely heartbreaking at an already devastating time. We went through something similar when my husband\u2019s brother died. His adult children had no interest in even helping. The daughter created a gfm page, raised less than $75. We were going to pay for cremation but it wasn\u2019t good enough. So we (w help of our family & friends) came up w the money to pay for a funeral & asked her to just use that money towards flowers. She told me she was too busy & didn\u2019t want to mess w it. I pressed. She gave me the info to use the money then immediately withdrew it for herself. Led everyone on social media to believe it was spent on her dad\n But not one penny went to him. Not once has she or her brother apologized or thanked us. It hurts. Now it\u2019s time to pay for the headstone & they don\u2019t really care abt that either.

How did cremation or coffin and embalming get paid for? Cemetery lot if buried? I can't imagine funeral with burial for $6k. In my area cremation alone runs $1k.", "NTA but your niece and nephew are.

They are irresponsible, that's not your problem.", "NTA. Honestly if I was donating I\u2019d be quite upset if the funds didn\u2019t go directly towards the funeral costs. Not being able to pay your rent is a result of poor planning not tragedy", "Definitely NTA.

If they want donations for their rent or bills then they can start a fund for that.", "NTA.

General funeral funds ARE donated to the surviving family in order to help them as they deal with the tragedy. If he covered their rent then this would have  helped them in the wake of losing their father AND financial support.", "Honestly, usually these are set up more vaguely like \u201cto help support the family\u201d.

It\u2019s always to support the family.\n\nThat said, niece and nephew went bananas here and acted very poorly.", "Maybe OP should have asked them what they needed and created a GFM aimed to help them??", "That's what I was wondering, the significant expense of a funeral is what is done with the body, not the memorial service.", "If they need rent money they can start their own gofundme! OP didn't have to anything more than they did. I also hope OP stops associating with them as much as possible.", "Oh OP 100% would have ended up in trouble. As a former PayPal employee (who holds GFM's treasury accounts and provides the payment facilitations in the background) we often investigated possible fraudulent fundraisers. From my own experience neither company fucks around and have a legal obligation to report suspicious activity, in good faith. OP has done the right thing through and through.", "OP says that the original GFM said that money beyond funeral expenses would be donated to charity. Why would OP be in trouble for doing just that? I think I must be misreading this.", "My dad died in April, and his cremation was $4000. I ordered his urn online. My aunt let me use her plot since multiple urns can be buried together. There was no service or wake at the funeral home. I had a celebration of life at a local place that charged me $100 to use their back room. My cousins made food. The cost was just for transporting his body from home where he died, to the funeral home cooler, and then to the crematorium and bringing his ashes back. A service would've added over $1000 and even more for a wake the night before. He wasn't ever embalmed or anything.\n\nFuneral costs are ridiculous.\n\nMy dad used to joke that I should just set him on the curb in a Hefty bag on trash day after he died. I made sure to get a beautiful black urn as a last little dark inside joke between us.", "It is,burials at my funeral home start at $6500 not including cemetery fees and cremation with church service $4900. Op seems to be leaving out the actual cost of the bill, no way is it $275. I understand the prices may be a little lower than I stated but nowhere near $275 total price.Plus how can OP have a wake with the deceased present when she isn\u2019t the legal next of kin? OP should\u2019ve consulted more with the family about where excess funds will go before creating the gofund me IMO and this situation wouldn\u2019t be happening.", "This is the question. If you took it on yourself without asking, you would be TA. That\u2019s overstepping.", "Because she doesn't like them and didn't want them to benefit in any way.", "I also noticed OP skipped over how old the kids are and where they live. It's not at all unusual these days to have a parent help pay rent in your early-mid 20s. Especially in high COL areas... which seems like is everywhere these days. OP, YTA.", "Took too long to find this. \nDef YTA.", "Yes good point! Everyone who has a job has enough money to make rent. /s", "What? Are the next of kin the only ones who can have a wake?", "Usually any excess funds from a funeral go to a nicer headstone, or a memorial plaque/bench/brick or whatever in the deceased\u2019s name.

It is right at the beginning of the post.", "Apparently you didn\u2019t read the post. It says funeral expenses and the remainder going to charity. If OP gave it to them instead of charity, what OP would be doing is committing fraud. Which would get OP in major legal trouble. Maybe you should read the whole post next time.", "Sadly it sounds more like these grown children seem way more concerned with having lost their source of funding than their father.  \n\nThe fact OP\u2019s BIL had no savings/funds to cover his funeral expenses would seem to indicate he was giving everything except what he needed for his expenses to the children.", "There are rigorous processes in place with GFM and the payment facilitator in the background (PayPal) whom both would be required to provide information in relation to information held on the accounts, when a formal request is made through appropriate channels. If it would come to it, OP can seek legal support and to request said information to help with any lawsuit/defamation case or whatever should they need it.", "One lesson I learned after making arrangements and sifting through final papers after my dad died two years ago was that family member\u2019s true colors come out when they hear of a death in the family and they think there may be any kind if money remaining.  It\u2019s appalling.", "It sounds like they were more upset that their cash bull was gone rather than their father", "This. We have one open right now to help our daughter with her cancer treatment (glioblastoma). It's purpose is \"to help <Daughter> with expenses associated with her treatment\". So -\n\nMeal delivery because she's too sick to cook - check.\n\nUber because she lost her drivers licence because of related seizures - check.\n\nRent because she's not working - check.\n\nNiblings are grieving, true, but their reaction is overboard. One wonders how much they were bleeding their dad financially overall.", "Support the family doesn't mean paying rent for the kids.\n\nSo now they have neither funeral or rent money.", "Exactly. Death comes with a lot of expenses, including outstanding bills, cleaning of the home, repairs, settling the debts of the deceased, food, travel, and of course, funeral or internment. Even the clothes you wear to a funeral and the food you serve after. OP could have planned and paid for the funeral herself and then turned the remaining money over to the kids, especially knowing that they depended on their dad for rent. But it wasn't about the funeral, it was about controlling them. \n\nESH, best case scenario. We don't know how old these \"kids\" are or what the father's actual wishes were for burial. Not everyone wants or can afford to put money in the ground. And if OP is any representative of the remaining family, maybe they didn't want to have to deal with everyone. There's no way to know. But the death was marred by ugliness and selfishness on all sides.", "Right, we went with someone who would do the service and the cremation and it was $5400 total. The cremation portion was $3500 I think. Maybe $3800.", "OP wouldn't have been in trouble if it went to charity. OP would 100% have been in trouble if it went to the kids' rent.", "I don\u2019t understand why OP wanted to donate the extra money to charity rather than to give it to the family for other expenses. It would suck for them to leave the funeral only to go to a homeless shelter.", "You didn't misread. Donating to charity is one thing. Giving it to family members to pay for housing is drastically different.", "Upvote for the hefty bag comment. You Dad sounds like he was fun.", "No comments by OP, no other posts.... this may be fiction.", "OP\u2019s husband (the deceased\u2019s brother) very well could have been next of kin. OP could\u2019ve made it to relieve stress off their husband.", "NTA.\nLawsuits against GoFundMe have already resulted from users fabricating their need for assistance before squandering the funds. They have the right to conduct an audit soon away and provide evidence that donors' money was not stolen. OP may have run afoul of the law at one point for donating the remaining cash.", "Nothing exposing the vultures like a funeral. I thought I would be spared this as my dad was poor as a church mouse, but it was not meant to. The little bit life insurance he left my mom was finished in a jiffy. People even asked for his clothes before the funeral happened.", "IF--and that's a big if--it had been talked about beforehand, I could see one month of rent being included in a 'support the family' thing. It'd allow someone who's financially stable to take a week or two off to grieve, unpaid, or someone who isn't financially stable the time to make arrangements to become so. But it wasn't discussed or even mentioned until the funeral was planned.\n\nI know absolutely nothing about funeral costs and hope I don't need to for another twenty years (my parents are in their sixties) but it strikes me as very odd they managed a funeral for under $300. You have to pay for whatever preparation is done (preparing the body for a wake, or the cremation costs, or whatnot) which probably costs a couple hundred alone; there's the cost of a coffin or urn or whatnot. Maybe you don't need a burial plot or tombstone if you go cremation. Usually also you'll need a building big enough to hold everyone there for the funeral... I feel like the niblings cheaped out on things so they could get more money.", "Why not? Who are you or OP to decide what their actual needs are? How could still having a place to live not fall under supporting the family? Dad handled those expenses and Dad is gone. It's a few days until rent is due. You want them to hold a funeral and then go to a shelter, because OP didn't respect her brother's choice to support his kids?", "There's no way a death cost $275.", "You can't just withdraw the funds willynilly and when you set up a fundraiser you state the purpose, as well as what you intend to do with funds that exceeds the target amount. So if you only need 2k and that is the target amount, then you will have to state (prior to the fundraiser going live) what the target excess would be used for. GFM also works with many charitable organisations and will provide an option to either select your desired charity or to disperse the remaining funds with charities that have open-ended fundraising goals.", "Seriously.  If I'm dead, throw me in the ground or cremate, whichever is cheaper.  Anything you can send towards my kids? Do so.\n\nI've never donated money to a funeral fund expecting any extra to go to a higher priced casket or bigger flowers.  I've usually hoped it would at least cover the cost of a few meals.", "OP\u2019s husband is immediate family. They could\u2019ve consulted their husband to relieve stress off of him.", "OP did note that excess money would be donated to charity, so he is covered there. Handing the money to the surviving family members to spend on whatever, however, would have been fraud.", "Or some of it was prepaid, that can happen.", "If you leave a body with the county coroner for long enough, they will ask next of kin to pay about that much for a pauper's burial.  It is literally just the amount needed to safely dispose of the body.  In some areas that is a communal grave. In others it is cremation.", "Even if you don't have a lavish funeral, it can still cost a lot of money.  You have to pay someone to dig the hole in the ground.", "Immediate family once you are adult with a family of your own is your partner and children. Most often, just the people in your household. In many countries this is actual legal definition because when immigrating you can support your immediate family to come with you but not mother, brother, etc.", "That's nuclear family not immediate family."]}
