We don\u2019t get along because I don\u2019t talk to my dad anymore. Apparently she owes my mom something so she said yes when my mom asked her to babysit Jack for two weeks. I didn\u2019t have to go but Jack begged me to come with.\n\nJack has a stuffed tiger that he takes everywhere. My mom thinks it\u2019s silly but he starts crying and she\u2019d rather not listen to that so stopped caring. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. Besides, Jack once told me that his tiger keeps him safe. I don\u2019t question it.\n\nAnyways, our grandma isn\u2019t really doing much. She mostly just tells Jack to shush and occasionally gives me the keys to her car to go out with Jack when she wants privacy. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t just let go of what happened last night. Jack and I share a bed because my grandma doesn\u2019t have space so I\u2019m always there before and after Jack falls asleep. But my boyfriend called me the second Jack closed his eyes so I stepped out for literally 4 minutes and when I got back Jack was crying and my grandma had his stuffed tiger in her hands.\n\nApparently she came by because she heard him whispering (he woke up a little bit after I walked out) and heard him talking to the tiger. She thought it was weird that he\u2019s 9 and still talks to his stuffed animals but was willing to walk away until she heard him say I love you. She walked in and snatched it out of his hands.\n\nI immediately got pissed off and sarcastically said that she really has her priorities straight. He can eat junk food, sleep whenever he wants, swear, cry, not shower, etc but she draws the line at him loving his stuffed animal. She stopped and threw the tiger back onto the bed but I was so upset with her that I kind of kept going. I told her that the tiger has done more for him than she ever has and if he loves the tiger then there is nothing she of all people can do about it. \n\nShe got mad and told me to get out. I wasn\u2019t leaving my brother so I called my boyfriend and we stayed the night with him. My mom called me later and said that that this whole situation is ridiculous and told me to relax and realize I created such a huge fuss over a stupid stuffed tiger. She\u2019s mad at me because my grandma\u2019s mad at her as well and is insulting both of us. They think that I went too far. I\u2019ve been trying to sleep all night but I can\u2019t stop thinking, AITA?\n\nJust wanted to add, I usually stay home alone with my brother but our mom forced us (or at least Jack) to stay with our grandma because of whatever agreement they had. We stayed the night at my boyfriend\u2019s house because his parents insisted but we\u2019re back in our own house now, and our mom still isn\u2019t back yet.", "created_utc": 1686984709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bjulz/aita_for_going_too_far_after_my_grandma_snatched/", "score": 974, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
