{"id": 19881, "submission_id": "14bjulz", "title": "AITA for going too far after my grandma snatched a stuffy out of my brother\u2019s hands?", "selftext": "My mom dumped me (18f) and my little brother Jack (9) off at my grandma\u2019s place. \n\nThis grandma is my dad\u2019s mom. We don\u2019t get along because I don\u2019t talk to my dad anymore. Apparently she owes my mom something so she said yes when my mom asked her to babysit Jack for two weeks. I didn\u2019t have to go but Jack begged me to come with.\n\nJack has a stuffed tiger that he takes everywhere. My mom thinks it\u2019s silly but he starts crying and she\u2019d rather not listen to that so stopped caring. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. Besides, Jack once told me that his tiger keeps him safe. I don\u2019t question it.\n\nAnyways, our grandma isn\u2019t really doing much. She mostly just tells Jack to shush and occasionally gives me the keys to her car to go out with Jack when she wants privacy. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t just let go of what happened last night. Jack and I share a bed because my grandma doesn\u2019t have space so I\u2019m always there before and after Jack falls asleep. But my boyfriend called me the second Jack closed his eyes so I stepped out for literally 4 minutes and when I got back Jack was crying and my grandma had his stuffed tiger in her hands.\n\nApparently she came by because she heard him whispering (he woke up a little bit after I walked out) and heard him talking to the tiger. She thought it was weird that he\u2019s 9 and still talks to his stuffed animals but was willing to walk away until she heard him say I love you. She walked in and snatched it out of his hands.\n\nI immediately got pissed off and sarcastically said that she really has her priorities straight. He can eat junk food, sleep whenever he wants, swear, cry, not shower, etc but she draws the line at him loving his stuffed animal. She stopped and threw the tiger back onto the bed but I was so upset with her that I kind of kept going. I told her that the tiger has done more for him than she ever has and if he loves the tiger then there is nothing she of all people can do about it. \n\nShe got mad and told me to get out. I wasn\u2019t leaving my brother so I called my boyfriend and we stayed the night with him. My mom called me later and said that that this whole situation is ridiculous and told me to relax and realize I created such a huge fuss over a stupid stuffed tiger. She\u2019s mad at me because my grandma\u2019s mad at her as well and is insulting both of us. They think that I went too far. I\u2019ve been trying to sleep all night but I can\u2019t stop thinking, AITA?\n\nJust wanted to add, I usually stay home alone with my brother but our mom forced us (or at least Jack) to stay with our grandma because of whatever agreement they had. We stayed the night at my boyfriend\u2019s house because his parents insisted but we\u2019re back in our own house now, and our mom still isn\u2019t back yet.", "created_utc": 1686984709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bjulz/aita_for_going_too_far_after_my_grandma_snatched/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re right to take up for your brother. I\u2019m sorry you both have to deal with the adults not having their act together.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you brother has you looking out for him when you are stuck with a mother and grandmother like these.", "I believe there are some studies showing that children being allowed to keep comfort items leads to a more well adjusted adulthood. I\u2019ve met a lot of people with similar memories of adults suddenly and seemingly for no reason removing these items, as they see it as a sign of weakness. You\u2019re nta op, and you\u2019ve given your brother the memory of being protected and defended rather than that of a trusted adult snatching away his (in all the ways that matter) friend. You may have saved him some on therapy, too.", "NTA 9 or 19 who the hell cares if he has a stuffed animal.", "Good on you for sticking up for your brother. That tiger is clearly important to him and he probably uses it to asses his own emotions. You clearly see this, it's a shame your mom or grandma done.\n\n100% NTA \n\nYou and your brother clearly have a very strong bond, always fight to keep this. You will never regret it.", " NTA I wish I had a big sister like you", "NTA\n\nMy brother still has his tiger.  I remember him putting it in his own son's crib. His son ended up preferring a different stuffed animal, so my brother took his tiger back. \n\nGood for you for standing up to the old bat. She's useless. Maybe you can talk to your mom about taking care of Jack if she needs a break instead of having him go to that horrible woman again.", "Definitely NTA.", "Your mother and grandmother sound horrible, I'm very sorry about that for you.  Great of you to stick up for your brother.  Is his name Calvin?  Sorry, had to ask.  NTA at all.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your brother! With such unsupportive adults around (except for you obv.) your brother has every right to having an emotional support stuffy.", "I'm 15 and nobody makes fun of me for talking to my fox plush.\n\nYeah, this grandma is treating your bro horribly.\n\nNTA.", "Op, you might be too young to have heard about the Calvin and Hobbes comics, but I\u2019ll bet your brother would love them. It\u2019s about a little boy (Calvin) and his stuffy Tiger (Hobbes) and their adventures. You can usually get the books from the library. \n\nDefinitely NTA. Thank you for looking after your brother and keeping him safe. I\u2019m 33f and have an emotional support stuffy. My 37m husband has some special stuffies too. Trauma sucks. You\u2019re never too old to need comfort and support. Especially when the grown ups that are supposed to take care of you have let you down. And yes, I\u2019ve told my stuffy I love him too. 100% NTA, you\u2019re your brothers hero.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're a hero for sticking up and digging in for him.", "No OP, in point of fact I think you've got a bright future ahead of you. You don't put up with unjustified bullshit from people older than you, and that's a good trait to have given the generation before even mind is so pompously full of itself that you can't hardly take some of them seriously. Your grandmother behaved like a bully over a stuffed toy and deserved to be thoroughly shat on over it. Your mothers also being completely ridiculous getting your grandmother to babysit the both of you, because you're an adult.
