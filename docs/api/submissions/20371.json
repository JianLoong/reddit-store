She even offered to pay, using the term \"take the olive branch\". I never wanted to, or had intentions to abort. I ended up cutting contact for 2 months. She reaches back out to me, and I decide to let the prev. convo go. After all, she is my mother. \n\nShe seemed excited for the baby. Things weren't great though. She would crap talk any ideas I had. Maternity pics by a popular photographer in my town, stupid. Her \"dance\" photographer should do my pics. Baby shower? Shes \"supposed to plan and throw it\", not me. Did any of it happen? ofc not. She begged me to be in the delivery room, and I never agreed. I wasn't comfortable with it. Not to mention, she treated me horribly the entire time. Lied and told everyone I'm already married, cancelled my baby shower, and so much more. Why would I let her? \n\nI hit my 35 week marker & was hospitalized for high BP due to preclapmsia. I told her i was in the hospital, and she starts berating me saying it is my fault bc i ate TX-Mex that day, & i don't take care of myself. Saturday, I'm hospitalized and put on the Mag drip. Monday at 6am, I'm induced. She blows up my phone saying she needs to be there and in the room, bc i promised her & am ruining \"her birth experience.\" I told her nobody is allowed except for my Fiance due to my health. She flips, texting my fiance & I rude texts, blasting my childhood trauma, telling my family members i had her banned from my room. (I did tell a nurse not to allow her in my room in case she did show up. My mom said she called & the nurses told her.) All of this is happening while I'm being induced for 12 hours straight, finally they end up having to do an emergency c section on me. I text her and say \" having emergency c section, love you. You can come see her after.\" in case something goes wrong, and get no response. Luckily that part went smooth. Healthy baby, healthy mom. At around 10 that night, I get a call from my little brother (16M) saying that what i did was wrong & how my mom was at my dads grave crying on the phone with my aunt bc of me. While hes telling me all of this, i can hear my mom whispering to him what to say. I tell him i love him & hang up. He texts me a super long scripted text, and she texts me more stuff while calling me non-stop. That night I developed PE and almost drown to death in my hospital bed for 2 days. During this time-frame she told my entire family that i had my fiances mother in the room, & there the entire time. Which none of it was true. \n\nSo I have had to clear my name slowly but surely, and she acts like she deserves to be able to have a relationship with me and my daughter. But i refuse to expose her to the narcissism and chronic lying. She won't even admit she was wrong or apologize. So AITA for not allowing her to watch or see my daughter? \n\nSN: The only reason I try to salvage our relationship is bc my dad passed away and shes my only parent left.", "created_utc": 1687488452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gmrvv/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mother_to_seewatch_my/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
