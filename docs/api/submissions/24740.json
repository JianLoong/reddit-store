Maybe check out r/emotionalneglect because he sounds like he has straight up abandoned you as a father", "NTA\n\nYour father is an entitled prick.", "NTA. It\u2019s about time they pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps. Cut them off, they\u2019ve been playing you for a mug. They\u2019re probably laughing at you, when they\u2019re on these little breaks together.", "NTA. It seems you view him as a father and he views you as an ATM. Your siblings will come to view you as such as well and become entitled. You\u2019ll be expected to put them through uni, pay for their weddings ( and not be invited) , and put a down payment towards their houses. Stop it now. May I ask what was your relationship with your dad before you got your high paying job? A father should have a relationship with his child no matter how old they are and no matter what assistance ( financial or the Reise) they provide. The onus is on dad to repair this relationship not the other way around.", "NTA: You are not HIS PERSONAL ATM. You work hard for your money so he doesn\u2019t have any right to it. Stop giving him money. If he wants to have \u201cfather-son bonding experience with his other boys he can pay for it. NOT YOUR KOB OR RESPONSIBILITY to provide these vacations. Just STOP! If any family is giving you shit tell them you are so relieved that they are offering to pay $20,000 for your dad to have the father-son experience with his  sons that you were never given, then let your dad know that these people are willing to step\nUp and provide the money for his vacation, then go NC with them and move on. Don\u2019t forget to block them all as well, they have no right to your hard earned money.", "Brah, you're being pimped.  I'm sorry for your loss of a father figure.  It's easier said than done, but go lo contact and care for yourself, because it's apparent to me that he's never going to care for yoy the way you hope him to.  At this point he seems to think he's your pimp or something...  :/", "Nta.  You aren't an atm.  Tell him to make money himself.  Or u may have to ghost him", "A grown ass man treating his own son this way should be both ashamed and embarrassed. Stop enabling him and don't give him anymore money. It may cost you your relationship with him, but if he can't come to his senses and own up to his improper behavior and apologize, there was nothing worth saving. We don't owe our parents for choosing to bring us into this world.", "20k for a trip??? Your old man either has a gambling or drug problem sorry. He doesn't want you to tag along because you would then realise the trip should only cost a fraction of what you would have given him. What benefit does your father bring to your life, being your sperm donor doesn't mean he's entitled to anything you earn.", "Ouch. NTA but man is he", "NTA. \n\n\n\nGod damn. My biggest fear is being a financial burden on my kids but with the way things are going it looks like that might happen. I got my first (and likely my second child, too) on a good trajectory; good grades, college bound (with some scholarships), healthy, and knowing they're loved and supported. If I (and/or my wife) end up having to live off of any of my kids I'll be horrified, ashamed, and guilt ridden. I can't imagine feeling this entitled to my children's wealth.", "Time for a new family cheers\ud83c\udf7a", "wtf NTA. does he hear how he sounds? who in their right mind funds a $20,000 vacation that they are not a part of???? like what\ud83d\ude2d", "He sounds like a bum. Nta", "NTA. So NTA. You're dad sounds like a spoiled brat.", "Wow. Definitely NTA. You are 100% in the right. Your dad is depending on you to pay for trips he won't include you in. Definitely treats you unfairly.", "NTA. you\u2019re being used. cut him off.", "20k on a holiday for someone else is a big chunk of money if you\u2019re only on 250k a year. 8% of the total salary. That\u2019s so much money, and for you to not even be allowed to join them? Nonsense.", "NTA. Your dad wants a father-son bonding trip (for $20,000) but doesn't want to include you - one of his sons? Focus on yourself and living your best life. Let your dad live on his own dime. Don't keep setting yourself up for this pain and rejection. You deserve better.", "NTA. He\u2019s the A. Simple.", "You are not denying him anything, he is more than welcome to pay for a vacation and go on it.  You are doing nothing to stop him.", "NTA. Your father expects you to pay for his vacations? He\u2019s young enough that he can get a better job and pay for his own vacations. I thought your story was about him depending on you for basic living needs and being disabled or something. What a mooch. You don\u2019t have to do anything for him.", ">You\u2019re his son, not his personal trust fund.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about time his father sees that. Pull the plug on giving him any more money since he\u2019s shown how little he actually cares about his own son.", "Insane behaviour from the dad, yeah. Sure, if you earn more than your parents it\u2019s nice to give something back, or help them out if needed. But he is acting really entitled and unreasonable. \nNTA, you were absolutely right to say no.", "But dad prolly sees him borrowing money from OP as father-son bonding!! Why is he being denied that!?!?\n\nNTA but definitely stop with being the personal ATM", "This is a ridiculous guilt trip. Your father is treating you like an ATM. NTA at all. Sounds like you have been too nice up to this point honestly.", "Father is a leech. Good thing that OP has had his wake up call, otherwise he would be bled dry.\n\nOP- NTA. And you owe your dad nothing. His relationship with his kids is HIS responsibility - not yours. So block everyone who tries to guilt you into this nonsense.", "Same!\nThe title made me think it was about emergencies. \nYou are his son, not his personal ATM. \n\nNTA!", "Context is so important on this one", "This could be on r/entitledparents", "\u201cbecause i know you\u2019ll pay for it\u201d \n\u2026.. wtf?", "If he or the other kids have a social media page actually make a crowdfund and link it in their feeds for the rest of the family to donate to the trip.\n\nETA: NTA", "Yeah at the salary op\nMakes 20k is too much to spend on vacation unless it is a very rare occurrence", "I like the idea of OP spending 20k on a holiday for himself and his half-siblings.", "I would be hard-pressed to justify giving my dad that much to spend of a vacation that I was going on! To promise his other kids bonding time, paid for by OP is insane. Op is NTA, dad needs a time-out.", "Where was he planning on taking his kids for 20K?!!", "As an Ohio native, please do not. My home state has enough issues, thanks. \ud83d\ude1b", "I was going to suggest North Carolina.", "I live in Texas, and let me cordially extend an invite to OP's dad here while it's hot as balls and humid as wet fart.", "My guess is Europe\n\nNot flying coach", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Hell for 10k he can do a lavish vacation.", "Yep! I've dealt with my dad being audacious and clueless,  not just *this* level as i dont have that kind of money.. They really do exist.", "Also who do you support I mean surround yourself with that would make YOU feel like the asshole in this?", "Except he\u2019s not borrowing, it\u2019s a gift. This guy has no intention of giving back a penny.", "NTA. Also the rest of your family don\u2019t sound like the sharpest knives in the kitchen. They may mean well but you may want to filter their advice in the future", "Honestly, I treat an ATM better than this.  I at least ask for the money first before I spend it.", ">yj5-193k-01 him??\n\n...a Kenmore Car Digital Media Audio Receiver....him?", "Couldn't agree with you more", "Mb *they* can give dear-old-dad $20000. /s", "And should be!", "Ooh didn't know about this one!", "I feel like this sub is going to get me heated \ud83d\ude02", "$20K sounds like romantic trip money (honeymoon suite style) now that I think about it.", "Seriously. We did a week in Disney for five people for less than half of that! (We stayed off-property)", "What has this world come to when a father won\u2019t even Kenmore Car Digital Media Audio Receiver his own son?!?", "Could agree with him Ken-more.", "Wedding money, maybe.", "I like that you specified, cause on-property over $20k is possible.", "My friend's dad would Bose 5.1 Home Entertainment System his son, but I knew money was tight and that my dad would Kenmore Car Digital Media Audio Receiver me with just as much love.", "It's a terrible shame", "I was Google Chromecast 4k with google tv'ed by my mom.
