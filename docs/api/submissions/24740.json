OK, we payed most, but it was because of his then wife.\n\nWe stayed in loose contact, phone from time to time.

But I was angry for my little brother.I was so angry about that, that I told him \"If you don't have any kids, then why are you here at a strangers home? Pack your stuff, I bring you to your parents.\"After that I broke contact to him.I just got some massages about him when a friend of him called me, that my father is in trouble in Zimbabwe (prison) and one time when I got a call that my father had a serious accident down there.
