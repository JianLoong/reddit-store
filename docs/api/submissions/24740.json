It\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for your father\u2019s vacation.  It sounds like he is just asking for more since you helped him out before.  It\u2019s probably time to stop giving him money.", "NTA.

It is inappropriate for your father to ask for large gifts from you.", "NTA.\n\nHe wants you to pay for a father and son bonding experience that he refuses to share with you. He's treating you like an ATM, not a son.\n\nIt is not your fault he is a deadbeat dad. It's not your fault he made a promise that he can't keep. Him promising to spend $20k of your money without asking you first is unbelievable. He must think you're desperate to win his approval. He's given himself way too much permission to treat you horribly.\n\nBare minimum, he should have apologized for mistreating you and never making time for a father-son trip with you. Instead, he doubled down on his AH behavior and yelled at you.\n\nCut off the flow of money. Spend your time, energy, and income on someone who treats you better. Consider spending time with your half-siblings without dad.\n\nETA: I make good money, and I don't spend $20k taking my wife and kids on vacation. Him asking you for that much money for a trip you aren't even allowed to go on is just mind boggling to me.
