Finances have always been mixed but then it was always easy - without really trying we'd be able to save 2-3k per month.\n\nWife was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago. All cured, caught early, Oncologist said she would still be able to work. Instead she quit on the spot and made us move to the other side of the country to be near her family. \n\nSince then, wife's recovered well, and instead of doing the job she was trained to do she's decided she wants to work 2 days a week as a librarian. And even that was at my insistence to get back into work really. To be absolutely clear, medically she's been absolutely fine for 18 months. \n\nOur finances have taken a hit and on of top we are now paying more on rent than we used to and are paying private school fees for our kids. It all adds up.\n\nI've stopped buying any luxuries but my wife refuses to adjust. She goes on overseas yoga holidays probably every 3 months. So many new clothes (I haven't bought any new clothes for myself in at least a year). She will however happily complain about how expensive our kids' lessons are but then go to the shop and buy herself an expensive bottle of champagne to cheer herself up. \n\nI feel no better than an ATM to her, and I'm absolutely sick of it. When we were both working we had equal say in our finances - whilst I earned multiples of her salary we both put equal effort into our work and home life. It seemed to work fine. \n\nBut she's chosen to work 2 days a week and earn about \u00a39k a year now and I can't stop thinking to myself she's choosing to sponge off me instead of going out and working. \n\nThis morning I had a notification from my bank saying 500 had left our account to an individual. I asked and when she denied knowledge I said \"ok no problem I'll call the bank and tell them it was a fraudulent purchase\" she then confessed that she bought herself a customised leather jacket, I said to her I was sick of her spending habits, that she didn't earn anywhere near enough to afford that kind of thing. \n\nShe told me \"well your salary can go on the bills, and then I would have enough money to buy that jacket\". I said to her I wasn't her dad, her salary wasn't her \"pocket money\", and that I expected her to contribute her own money to our bills.\n\nI never used to have a problem with her spending when we both worked equally hard. But I am really struggling not to be furious with her every time she makes a lavish purchase which only my salary (and my continued effort, working full time) could afford. I feel that if she wants to earn less than minimum wage then she should act like it when it comes to spending.

Are u living pay check to pay check? I mean private school alone on average is 20,000 per kid per year. IDK we live in a HCOL area and can't even dream of that lifestyle on 160,000. So maybe I'm not in line with reality of other places. I does make me think this post might be fake... Anyway if not she needs to curb her spending no doubt, it is not realistic and needs to stop. but I do have to ask, since you are working full time is she doing more of the child rearing and domestic stuffs? How is the domestic labor divided? Would she have any reason to find a full time job overwhelming? She may also still have residual fatigue from her bout with cancer.

So, no she shouldn't financially ruin you both as she recovers but I urge you to consider that she isn't feeling 1000% herself. You really are being generous in supporting her recovery and it will help you both if you can reframe what's happening to not be that she is totally fine now and acting out, she is recalibrating and everyone does it in their own way.
