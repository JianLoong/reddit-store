It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to pay less. You didn\u2019t get a room and would have been more comfortable in a hotel.", "NTA. I\u2019d discuss it ahead of time, and straight up say that you have no problem paying full share but you want a bed for that price like everyone else, and someone else can have the cot and pay half price. \n\nI think willingness to pay full price, if given full accommodations, changes the situation from just saying that you\u2019re paying half because you have a cot.  Everyone else will think about it, and then anyone hard up to save the money might take the cot off your hands. If not, no big deal and you\u2019re not paying full price.", "I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb's with friends. If you didn't get a private room you pay about half as those who did.

Are the hotels all booked up now?", "Nta", "Nta.\n\n\"I wish I had known ahead of time. I didn't want to tell you guys this but I have a medical issue with my spine discs which prevents me sleeping on a cot, unless someone wants to swap with me, i'll need to grab a hotel and use cabs to travel. \"\n\nWhoever organised this knew you were gonna spend 600 on a cot. Wasn't random. Else it would have been discussed as a group - the airbnb adverts are always clear about bedroom numbers and sleeping places available with types (bed, pullout, cot etc). Your \"friends\" are stiffing you", "NTA \n\nDifferences if you have a room versus not.\n\nBetter sleep with less incidents of hurting your back.\n\nPrivate place to get changed and be in your sleep clothes.\n\nPrivate place to feel sick, gassy, have a head ache if hungover.\n\nPlace that feels more secure, especially when you're asleep and don't know these people.\n\nWould be nice to have a private place for some down time because being around people non stop that you just met is draining at best and anxiety inducing.\n\nAn acceptable place to bring someone to, with ability to have sex.\n\nPrivate place to store your belongings.\n\nPrivate place where you control the light being off, blinds closed and have quiet.\n\nA private place to go to sleep and wake up when you like without being disturbed or being on everyone's time because you're in a common area.\n\nWithout a room, you will be the last to get to sleep and first to have to wake up.\n\nIf people decide to stay up late, drunk and keep partying or chatting or eating, this affects you when on a cot.\n\nIf people wake up early to eat, watch TV and chat, this affects you.\n\nOver all you're sleep is being impacted in multiple ways.\n\nI'm sure there's reasons I missed but yea, without a private room, I know many who would have planned their own place ahead of time.\n\nIf it's no big deal then someone else can step up and give up their room.\n\nThere's no way you should pay full price but even paying less, this isn't something I'd want to do, most especially with people I barely know.\n\n$300 a night is a lot to pay for that and naturally no one else wanted the cot. Likely no one else is willing to take the cot and if they did, they'd refute the cost.\n\nI will add the benefit of not staying in your own hotel, which I understand is too late to do now... Staying together in one place does create a fun dynamic and more opportunity to just let loose and have laughs with everyone. It just feels more united and will likely have more of the funny moments you all remember and more moments for good chats and an ability to get to know them.\n\nAs you flew in, I'm unsure if that matters any, maybe you never see them again outside the wedding. But it can make for some good fun!\n\nWe do tend to put up with all sorts of chaotic stuff like this for weddings and parties. And people get so busy thinking about themselves they don't notice others.\n\nReasonable people will hear you out and realize they hadn't considered that and likely agree with you. \nSpeaking up is good. I would guess the groom notices the sacrifice you made and appreciates you joining.\n\nWill be a chaotic couple days but roll with it, let it add to the fun.\nHave fun!!", "Yeah. Rep value vs saving $50...\nUp to you.", "I like this a lot\nEdit: I\u2019ve done exactly this, let\u2019s see what happens", "I like how you've approached this. It's fair to whoever gets the cot to pay less & I'm happy to pay full price for a room or less for the cot.\n\nNTA", "Thank you this helps", "Random AFAIK. All the women have rooms, and the two other men do.", "He\u2019s not asking for it to be free he\u2019s asking for it to be fair.", "The group as a whole yeah. I won\u2019t more or less than others", "They aren\u2019t but they\u2019re about 5 miles away and I don\u2019t know how transport will be. We arrive to the Airbnb in the morning.", "I really only know the groom to be plus two more of them. Never met the people organizing.", "Honestly, the owner is basing on likely each person a day/night, so to ask to pay less when it's not them setting the rate despite not having a bed, imo would be unfair.", "Well, then, why did you said you would\u2019ve booked a hotel had you known?", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s asking the AirBnB host to charge less, he is just asking that the total cost be split fairly amongst all the people staying\u2026", "I found out about this a couple hours ago. The hotel presents a whole set of logistical challenges, including the likely need for a rental car (many locations now sold out due to holiday) plus the room rate is likely higher last minute. These are things I could\u2019ve avoided if planning were adequate.", "NTA.  WTF?  This is so disrespectful.  I\u2019d be changing my flight and going home early.  I wouldn\u2019t be paying towards the Airbnb either.", "NTA. If I'm expected to pay the same as everyone else then I expect equal value. In this case that would mean I get a bedroom too.", "NTA.  Do a reverse auction for the cot.  Start at 600 and slowly lower.  First person to take it gets it at the discounted price.\n\nEveryone gets a fair shot.  If no one would take it at full price why should you.", "600 to sleep on a cot? Hell no, NTA. \n\nYou said you didn't know there was no room for you? I would not stay even with a discount. Incredibly disrespectful.", "Walk your hiney right to the nearest 4 star", "NTA and you should definitely be paying a reduced rate. How was it decided that you ended up without a bedroom?", "Hope they go for someone else saving money", "NTA! I feel so sorry you're in this situation.", "Same", "Update?", "Just get a hotel $600 for two nights at a Airbnb is such a ripoff especially when you\u2019re apparently splitting it with lots of other people. Me and 12 other people rented out a whole house in SoCal with like 8 bedrooms and each person paid around $140 for three days. Idk if you guys are staying in a mansion or whatever but there is no way it should cost that much. Get a hotel and Uber to the bachelor party you will save so much and get a nice bed to sleep in. NTA", "Absolutely not. Paying 600 for two nights on a cot is ridiculous. I'd book that hotel and leave them a box of rocks to kick.", "How many people are paying $600 each for two nights? That seems excessive this place better be a mansion...I don't get it.", "NTA- they better not be asking you for the full $600 \ud83e\udd74 I would gently let them know that I will be booking accommodations elsewhere. They didn\u2019t fully think about and prepare for the amount of guests and it\u2019s not fair you got the short end of the stick.", "By Cot do you mean like what a baby sleeps in or is this something diffrent like a pull out bed or something slightly comfused how a grown adult is fitting in a cot.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nPoor planning on the organizers fault.\n\nDo not go along with it.\n\nIt's only fair to pay substantially less than the others.\n\nI'd honestly leave and go to a hotel or a separate Airbnb where you'd at least have a bed and privacy. Not to mention a cot can really mess up your back.", "Nta unless the plan was that someone would draw the short straw and that was you.", "NTA, but you will be remembered for it. Is it worth saving those bucks for that?", "No but bringing it up may be socially uncouth. Should establish that before the room stay", "This! You have a medical issue with your back and need to sleep in a proper bed. If you can\u2019t have this then you need to make alternative arrangements!", "This is the exact kind of clap trap that encourages people to shut up and accept being exploited or unfairly treated. If something isn't right you get to say that.", "Info: did you get an answer back?", "I would honestly double check the price of the house where yous are all staying for what 2 nights? Even by yourself 300 for a night is hella expensive.", "They know each other already, I\u2019m guessing?", "There\u2019s women at a sleep over bachelor party?", "I agree. Just be socially uncouth. It\u2019s a fine option.", "He died. Welp we\u2019ll get \u2018em next time", "Not yet but I replied to the email after midnight (it came in during my cross country flight) and it\u2019s only just after 7am now. Sucks to have learned this while on the plane.", "Most of them do", "The groom is lgbt", "I\u2019d just leave if they still want you to pay full price.  Nta", "Keep us updated - we are invested now\u2026 sounds like a good solution. Just wondering though why you were the one that was picked to get the cot instead of a room - that stinks a bit. It would have been fairer to draw straws and then everyone buy the cot guy a free drink on the first night", "Doh. That was completely heteronormative thinking on my part. Thanks for the correction!"]}
