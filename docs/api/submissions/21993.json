You are allowed to choose the level of relationship you have with your biological relatives and don't owe anybody anything. \n\nI do want to gently push back on something you said, though. It would not be spitting in the face of your parents if you decided on contact with your bio relatives. You love your parents, they love you, and your relationship is based on years of commitment and support. Nobody is going to replace them. It would be more like looking up an estranged second cousin and getting to know them-- they're just somebody you have a genetic connection to, not an act of rejection. \n\nMaybe you'll never want to meet any of them, and that's absolutely fine. I had no desire to connect with my bio family until I had a baby myself, and then I wanted to understand more about why they made that decision. We have occasional contact but nothing deep or profound. Some people never feel that desire. I just want you to try not to think of it as an attack because if your feelings do change one day, it could give you unnecessary guilt.", "The only AH here are your biological parents.. twins have such a unique and intricate bond, keeping one and putting one up for adoption is so fucked.

Maybe one day you will reconsider. Either way, you are fine.", "NTA. I feel likes it's more your biological parent's fault so you can atleast meet up with the twin but your feelings are valid and if the twin is thinking you are an asshole maybe he isn't the best of people and maintaining your distance is better.

You have the right to decide for yourself who to let into it. But I won't call an 18 year old kid an asshole for wanting to meet his twin. And I cannot judge your biological parents.

Splitting up TWINS? I'm adopted, and I would rarely criticize bio parents unless they kids were taken away for abuse or something along those lines. But in this case, your bio parents are awful people and that is a form of abuse to split up twins. They should have kept both, or had you both adopted out.", "NTA! Not even a little bit. I grew up in the system and your twin has no idea what it feels like to be abandoned and left behind. I am so happy you had a good outcome. You may change your mind as you grow but you may not.

And they don't get an opinion either.\nI have a good adult life but my issues snuck up on me in my 30's and I wasn't prepared. I am also fairly self aware and happy.

Fellow adoptee and separated twin here, you don\u2019t owe your twin anything.", "NTA. That\u2019s a tough situation anyway you look at it but your twin had nothing to do with it.

I can imagine there being a lot of resentment. It must feel awful feeling like you were given up,  but,  I'm glad you ended up with a family who loved you deeply as their own.  Maybe your biological parents couldn't give you that themselves.  \n\nMaybe one day you'll reconsider a meet up.  You won't be disrespectful in any way to your adopted family by meeting your biological family.  You know who raised you.  You know who your parents are and who your family is.

That's not good if that's the case.\n\nYou don't owe them anything. I can understand having resentment and not wanting to meet your bio parents but your sibling is literally blameless in everything.

You didn\u2019t choose to be separated and adopted at birth, and your twin didn\u2019t choose to be separated from you and kept by your bio parents. \n\nI hope in time you will realise there may be positive benefits of getting to know your twin, and maybe your bio parents.", "It's completely understandable that you don't want to get involved into that. NTA. The people who raised you are your real family.", "I'm adopted too and while this whole twin thing is actually very interesting and unique, people who aren't adopted don't seem to understand the lack of desire meet biological family. My family is my adopted family. Those are my \"real parents\" and if I say no I don't want to find my biological family, Don't ask why. It's like asking why don't you want to meet some random strangers? Who wants that emotional baggage?", "I'm not adopted but I totally understand the viewpoint. In my mind your adoptive parents are your real parents and therefore there is nobody of any importance to meet. It's normally to give closure to the bio family or because they need a kidney", "This is why I don't want to meet my biological family because I don't want more questions and emotions that I am totally free of right now. \nI'm sorry that happened to you, I think that if you give up a child for a closed adoption, you don't get to reach out to them. The kid should have to come to you.", "Very well put. No reasonable adult going down the path to adopting a child does so assuming that their child will never want to seek out a biological connection. Some adoptees will, others won't, and in today's age of genetic testing, I think most will end up with some low level connections as described above. All of those are okay options, and OP may go through all of these options multiple times. Your journey in life is yours alone. \n\nI would suggest that OP seeks out an adoptee support group or network. These are the kinds of nuanced situations that can only be fully understood by someone who has been through it. \n\nWish you luck, peace, and understanding", "Additionally, knowing potential genetic conditions and family medical history comes in a hell of a lot of handy. You either die or become disabled, and when you do, you might want a few tips.", "They sound like cool parents who would support OP through the process if OP changed their mind", "I am not adopted.  I wondering if an adoptee might want to meet a sibling, especially a twin, as the sibling would not have been part of the choice to give up a child.  kt", "I have twins and I could have never fathomed giving one away. I happened to have identicals. Just because they're identical doesn't mean they're the same and one is disposable. They're both individuals and have their own personalities. I hate when people make it seem like \"buy one get one\" like you get an \"extra\". They are not an extra, they are a whole ass human being, valid as any other sibling/singleton.", "Idk, I'm a twin and I actually never talk to my twin. We text maybe once a year. I get a little tired of the \"twin bond\" stereotype, I often forget we're twins.", "Your take is 1 dimensional. If they put both babies up for adoption there is no guarantee they would stay together. If they couldn't afford two babies it would be cruel to have both babies suffer. This way both babies grew up comfortably (I hope). Op had a great life so the bio parents did the right thing for him.\n\nTwins have such unique and intricate bond....sometimes not always. Many people had their twins die in the womb or at birth and didn't know tell years later when it was revealed to them. They never felt something missing or wrong. The same for twins separated at birth or as toddlers that do not remeber each other. Even twins who grow up together may not like each other or have any emotional bond with their sibling.", "Twin is an asshole for not understanding why OP doesn't want to meet his parents.", "Gee, almost like being the unwanted child really fucks you up and builds a lot of resentment for the people that tossed you away", "I\u2019m now in my early 40s so unfortunately the anger doesn\u2019t go away, I am incredibly grateful though that I was adopted into an amazing family and try and focus on the positives \u2026. I went a lot further in life then they did", "I feel like every time you see someone meet their biological family on TV or in movies it goes positively, which is not always the case and I think it needs to be represented realistically.", "(Happy cake day!)", "Unfortunately MANY adoptive parents try to guilt their children into not seeking out biological family. You only have to look at reddit threads on adoption to see how pervasive that attitude is. OP is NTA for not wanting to meet their bio family, but it should be a choice they make for themselves, not something they rule out because of a sense of loyalty to their parents.\n\nIn this situation, I think a lot of people would feel like it was a can of worms, it's definitely valid not to want to go down that path.", "My mother has a twin sister. Unsolicited maternal wisdom comes in club packs around here, but I digress.  Every time my mother has been in the hospital, her twin sister has sensed it and contacted me to be part of whatever decision we make. It\u2019s crazy. They feel each other\u2019s pain.  They feel each other\u2019s pain, but won\u2019t share a hotel room with each other (but both are happy to share with me).   Twins are odd.", ">If they put both babies up for adoption there is no guarantee they would stay together.\n\nIn private adoption, they absolutely would have. There are far more waiting adoptive parents than there are babies available for adoption. Some adoptive parents would have been over the moon to have twins.", "They're 18 and he *just* found out that there's someone out there who is his *twin*. \n\nI mean, him wanting to know more is a totally normal response. He missed out on having someone who was supposed to be a huge part of his life.\n\nI'm going to say NAH\n\nHaving a baby is very overwhelming, even if you're an adult and choose to do it and studied what to expect, etc. So I can see why two young people would really struggle with one, let alone two babies. \n\nAlso, teenagers tend to not be able to make fantastic decisions because their brains aren't done forming. They don't foresee the long term consequences. \n\nThey may have rationalized it as giving one of the two babies a \"better chance at life\". I don't know.\n\nI just can't say they are assholes because they were kids who were in a situation they couldn't handle.\n\nAnd as for his brother...\n\nIt's possible he *did* think about how angry OP might be at their bio parents because *he's* angry too. He was never given the chance to prove that he wants to be brothers. That opportunity was stolen from BOTH of the twins and it isn't *either* of their faults.\n\nIt's a tough situation and I feel for both of them.", "Seems likely they didn't have a lot of choice in the matter, not that the story is actually known.", "Open adoption has been growing since the 1990s, and is now the norm. My kids will never \"find\" their biological families because they know them. We're ALL family. Over 90% of adoptions are open adoptions, according to the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, and open adoptions are better for adoptees.", "Designated driver/shitter", "Her dear son passed at 3 days old. Dear daughter, now 15, met another little girl at 3 and created a twin bond with her.", "What level of reading skills do you have ?  Read it again, slowly", "Some twins are odd...your mother just happens to be apart of a lucky/unlucky duo that experience such things.", "If his response was solely based on OP not wanting to see *him*, I would understand. But he has no right to force OP into seeing his parents, who, regardless of their reasons, did chose to give him away. OP not wanting to see them is understandable, and it doesn't make him an asshole. If the twin's angry, his anger should be completely directed to his parents. He shouldn't be name-calling OP.", "They literally chose to keep one of the two kids. That's going to fuck you up psychologically regardless of circumstance. OP wasn't ripped from their arms", "Does this mean something? Why not just say son and daughter?", "No, you're right. Fair enough. I went back and re-read it and I missed how the twin called him an asshole. \n\nThat's not cool. Its definitely an awful situation for both of the twins. Gonna be high emotions on both sides.", "As I said, we don't actually know the story. Apparently they were very young, and that could mean very young indeed. I basically assume they were minors.", "It's an acronym bled over from some other sub, something like r/justnoMIL, I think started with DH and DW for dear husband/wife.", "DD, DH, DS, and DW are very common abbreviations in adoption groups, and other parenting groups as well.", "Yet they kept one kid. OP will always be the unwanted one. You can't magically rationalize that away.", "I've been wondering about these terms for years, thanks for explaining it! From context it wasn't necessary to know what it stood for, in my head I always read it as DaHusband.", "Not a matter of rationalizing anything away. To some extent it's a matter of not caring. To some extent it's a matter of accepting that other people also have their difficult circumstances. It's also extremely likely that OP ended up in a much better situation, as anyone who's in a position to adopt is probably in a more stable situation both emotionally and financially than a child giving up a baby.\n\n\"Why did my birth parents give me up?\" Doesn't need to be a source of angst. The most likely answer is that they were poor.\n\nAt any rate, meeting your twin brother is something worth doing, Even if only for the sake of curiosity and courtesy.", "You're badly diminishing OP's perspective on all this. They could have far more easily ended up as yet another statistic and ended up in a shit group home. They won the adoption lottery. \n\nSo what if the parents were poor. They still kept the other kid!! They utterly rejected OP. \n\nAnd they don't owe their twin jack crap. The twin is family by blood only. Blood is worthless. Literally all humans are related via Mitochondria Eve. They have a real family that loves them."]}
