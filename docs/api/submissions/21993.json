You are allowed to choose the level of relationship you have with your biological relatives and don't owe anybody anything. \n\nI do want to gently push back on something you said, though. It would not be spitting in the face of your parents if you decided on contact with your bio relatives. You love your parents, they love you, and your relationship is based on years of commitment and support. Nobody is going to replace them. It would be more like looking up an estranged second cousin and getting to know them-- they're just somebody you have a genetic connection to, not an act of rejection. \n\nMaybe you'll never want to meet any of them, and that's absolutely fine. I had no desire to connect with my bio family until I had a baby myself, and then I wanted to understand more about why they made that decision. We have occasional contact but nothing deep or profound. Some people never feel that desire. I just want you to try not to think of it as an attack because if your feelings do change one day, it could give you unnecessary guilt.", "The only AH here are your biological parents.. twins have such a unique and intricate bond, keeping one and putting one up for adoption is so fucked.

Maybe one day you will reconsider. Either way, you are fine.", "NTA. I feel likes it's more your biological parent's fault so you can atleast meet up with the twin but your feelings are valid and if the twin is thinking you are an asshole maybe he isn't the best of people and maintaining your distance is better.

You have the right to decide for yourself who to let into it. But I won't call an 18 year old kid an asshole for wanting to meet his twin. And I cannot judge your biological parents.

Splitting up TWINS? I'm adopted, and I would rarely criticize bio parents unless they kids were taken away for abuse or something along those lines. But in this case, your bio parents are awful people and that is a form of abuse to split up twins. They should have kept both, or had you both adopted out.", "NTA! Not even a little bit. I grew up in the system and your twin has no idea what it feels like to be abandoned and left behind. I am so happy you had a good outcome. You may change your mind as you grow but you may not.

And they don't get an opinion either.\nI have a good adult life but my issues snuck up on me in my 30's and I wasn't prepared. I am also fairly self aware and happy.

Fellow adoptee and separated twin here, you don\u2019t owe your twin anything.", "NTA. That\u2019s a tough situation anyway you look at it but your twin had nothing to do with it.

I can imagine there being a lot of resentment. It must feel awful feeling like you were given up,  but,  I'm glad you ended up with a family who loved you deeply as their own.  Maybe your biological parents couldn't give you that themselves.  \n\nMaybe one day you'll reconsider a meet up.  You won't be disrespectful in any way to your adopted family by meeting your biological family.  You know who raised you.  You know who your parents are and who your family is.

That's not good if that's the case.\n\nYou don't owe them anything. I can understand having resentment and not wanting to meet your bio parents but your sibling is literally blameless in everything.

I don't know that that's a can of worms I'd want to (possibly) open.", "I would like to have met my bio parents given how atrocious my adoptive mother was.", "Same! I'm not adopted (though my mum has told me over 30 years I am, and I wish I was haha) but i don't think OP owes these people anything. OP's family are their adoptive family. That's it. They owe nothing to the biological family. \n\nMy father has been married 4 times, my mother was wife #1. Wife #2 didn't want her kids (my half sisters) to meet us. She was always jealous my father had a family before her. But i always said that she tells them we aren't family, even though they wanted to meet us, until one of them need a kidney lol. \n\nI have a relationship with one of them, which is great. Her mother constantly gives her shit over it", "My mom (I'm not adopted) always says that adopted children are more special. Biological children are born to their parents and the parents raise them because that's what they were given. So it's a situation of adjustment and compromise. On the other hand, an adopted child is lucky because the parents had all the time and options in the world to choose from, and out of everybody they chose that particular kid, so the adopted child is a chosen and wanted one. \n\nTbh I can never know how to process that statement. Feel happy for adopted children like OP, or simultaneously also feel bad for biological children like the rest of us? And is this something all bio parents feel about their children? Is it a feeling or just a statement? Does it mean anything? Who knows.", "What if OP needs a kidney - they should keep the twin in their pocket for spare parts even if they don't care about the relationship", "My uncle's were split up at birth. They were the result of an affair my grandfather had and the mom didn't want to keep them. My grandmother tried to get both but my uncle David was already adopted by the time she found out. She brought home my uncle Patrick who is developmentally disabled and had cerebral palsy. \n\nMy grandmother raised him just like he was hers, ignored doctors that suggested institutionalizing him and gave him a good life. He did eventually end up as a ward of the state because he became VERY strong and when he was upset he'd accidentally hurt people. He still came home every weekend and all holidays though and he and I were like siblings as he's only 10 years older than me but mentally much younger.\n\nIn 2019 his twin finally found him after searching for DECADES.  The adoption files were sealed and his adopted mom only knew his brother was named Patrick and he was disabled. When our state declassified old, closed adoptions he was finally able to figure it out. \n\nMy uncle Patrick ADORES his brother and they spend nearly every Saturday together now. They are 55 and I just think about how much time they lost being together.  \n\nSplitting up siblings should be illegal, but especially twins.", ">It's psychotic and awful to split up twins. They should have kept both, or adopted them both out. *I'm surprised they were allowed to split them up tbh.*\n\nI'm still trying to process this part of OP's post. Splitting up twins like that seems bizarre.", "I don\u2019t think there is a way to prevent it, really. If they don\u2019t want one of the kids there is no way the state can force them to keep OP. Push comes to shove they could always anonymously leave OP in a baby hatch. \n\nThe state wouldn\u2019t take custody of OP\u2019s twin by force since they wanted to keep him; they always prefer to keep biological parent and child together. so from the state\u2019s POV, better let them split the twins over the table than prevent something worse potentially happening.", "I\u2019m an adoptive parent and I couldn\u2019t agree more. I love my kids with all of my heart, and nothing would make me happier than to support whatever relationship they\u2019d like with their birth families. I would be devastated if my kids didn\u2019t follow their hearts for fear of hurting my feelings. I\u2019m their mother and nothing will ever change that. But I also know (and honour) the fact that they also have another mother, the first mother. Please do whatever is right for you\u2026put yourself front and centre of your decision.", "I can see wanting tips when you die, I don\u2019t know how useful they would be but it\u2019s worth considering isn\u2019t it? \ud83d\ude09", "That is why there is genetic testing and regular annual physicals.", "There are simple DNA tests that can screen for generic conditions.\n\nMy cousin contacted her birth mom out of curiosity and it was a disaster.  The birth mom expected my 20 tear old cousin to drop out of college to help take care of her younger brothers and sisters. She actually agreed to help out for a Summer but after two weeks of emotional abuse my cousin left.  Zero contact now.", "One of my husbands aunts was actually his first cousin. One of my FILs brothers knocked up his gf at the time when they were both teens. The uncle and gf both wanted nothing to do with their daughter. My FILs parents raised her as one of their own and told her for years she was their daughter. Eventually she found out but it didn\u2019t seem to affect her too much.", "What type of twins are you?", "I was a twin but the other child died very early on in the pregnancy, not sure exactly what happened but the joke has always been that I ate my twin. I always felt like I was missing something & it made sense when I found out about this potential sibling I could have had. You say that the comment you\u2019re replying to is one dimensional but yours is dismissive.\n\nClarification \u2014 there were two heartbeats & then there was one, things were never properly explained to my mum so I also don\u2019t really know what happened.", "My father had a twin brother.  They were nothing alike and often went for years without seeing each other.  There was no animosity .  My father was an emotionally lazy man and did not maintain contact, he expected people to reach out to him,  My uncle was a different fellow.  It was said that he fell out of a two story window when he was two, and he damaged his brain.  He was self supporting, but he never drove a car, never owned a phone, and married a woman not that much younger than his mother.  He was intelligent enough to serve in WWII and earn a Purple Heart.  He never had children.  They did not look like brothers. much less twins.  My dad looked more like Rock Hudson, 6'2\" and a full head of dark hair with green eyes.  My uncle was about 5'8\", and balding from my earliest memories of him.  kt", "But twin had nothing to do with that?! He just was told he had a twin! How is it the fault of the 18 year old that his parents are absolutely shit?", "I\u2019d really like to hope that a twin separation like this wouldn\u2019t happen *now*, especially with identical twins, but siblings should be kept together whenever possible imo.", "She\u2019s just illustrating that an adopted child is always planned for, so while their biological family may have chosen to give them up (for various reasons, some of which are extremely valid and for the child\u2019s own good) somebody still chose them. Being adopted can be hard for a kid because they don\u2019t understand the adult themes that outlined their parents giving them up. So knowing that they have someone who specifically wanted them still is an important thing for them to have. \n\nBut this works both ways. Biological children ARE chosen too. Because remember, they didn\u2019t have to keep you, they could have put you up for adoption if they thought it best. But they still chose you, to raise you and love you because that\u2019s what they wanted. In all scenarios of a loving home, the child is chosen and wanted, regardless of how they got there. \n\nI\u2019m the father of a two year old beautiful girl. She wasn\u2019t planned for, but she was chosen. She\u2019s loved. She\u2019s the best thing that I\u2019ve ever done and not only would I die for her, I will live for her.

I'm glad they were finally reunited, though. And yes, I agree it should be illegal to split up twins.", "It is. \nNTA.
