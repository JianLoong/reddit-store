I\u2019m adopted, too. It comes with a special set of privileges and challenges that people who were raised in their biological families don\u2019t understand. But please make sure your choice is about what *you* want, and not about your adoptive family.", "NTA. I'm also an adult adoptee. You are allowed to choose the level of relationship you have with your biological relatives and don't owe anybody anything. \n\nI do want to gently push back on something you said, though. It would not be spitting in the face of your parents if you decided on contact with your bio relatives. You love your parents, they love you, and your relationship is based on years of commitment and support. Nobody is going to replace them. It would be more like looking up an estranged second cousin and getting to know them-- they're just somebody you have a genetic connection to, not an act of rejection. \n\nMaybe you'll never want to meet any of them, and that's absolutely fine. I had no desire to connect with my bio family until I had a baby myself, and then I wanted to understand more about why they made that decision. We have occasional contact but nothing deep or profound. Some people never feel that desire. I just want you to try not to think of it as an attack because if your feelings do change one day, it could give you unnecessary guilt.", "The only AH here are your biological parents.. twins have such a unique and intricate bond, keeping one and putting one up for adoption is so fucked. I do feel for your twin though.. I imagine it\u2019s very confusing and sad and shitty to be in his shoes as well.", "NTA\n\nFellow adoptee and I was in your shoes at 18 as my biological family wanted to meet me literally the day I turned that age\n\nUnfortunately in my case it didn\u2019t work out and I had nothing in common with those people and I think it left me more angry and with more questions \n\nUltimately you need to do what is right for you OP\n\nDon\u2019t let them peer pressure you into this and you can say something like \u201cI\u2019m not ready for this right now and if in years to come I am I\u2019ll reach out to you\u201d \n\nIn the meantime you have every right to block them and ask them to stop harassing you", "NAH. Some people want to know their biological families and some don't. Your twin isn't an AH for wanting to meet you, and you're not an AH  for not wanting to meet them. \n\nAs a mom through adoption, though, I know that my children's relationships with their birth families aren't a reflection on me as a parent. I would hope that your parents wouldn't think it's \"spitting in their faces\" for their child to want to meet their biological family.", "NTA-and you don\u2019t have to explain to anyone why you don\u2019t want to meet a stranger.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to not want to meet them, and he\u2019s allowed to be upset by that. If he pushes it, for me, it would switch to N T A, though.", "NTA. You have your right to be left alone. Maybe one day you will reconsider. Either way, you are fine.", "NTA. I feel likes it's more your biological parent's fault so you can atleast meet up with the twin but your feelings are valid and if the twin is thinking you are an asshole maybe he isn't the best of people and maintaining your distance is better. But even if you try to form a relationship I don't think you would spitting on your family's face as they would understand. Do what you want and feel is right", "NAH. You have the right to decide for yourself who to let into it. But I won't call an 18 year old kid an asshole for wanting to meet his twin. And I cannot judge your biological parents. I am glad you have an amazing family. Keep it up.", "NTA\n\nHonestly this is your call to make no matter what decision you come to. It's 100% understandable that you feel the way you do given the situation you've been put in.", "NTA\n\nYou have valid feelings, are are in now way obligated to meet anyone you don't want to.\n\nHowever, keep in mind you can change your mind at any time.  Maybe 10 years from now you will feel like meeting them.", "NTA, though your twin isn't an asshole for the most part (he is an asshole for not understanding that you don't want to meet your bio parents). \n\nBut really, what the fuck was wrong with your biological parents? Splitting up TWINS? I'm adopted, and I would rarely criticize bio parents unless they kids were taken away for abuse or something along those lines. But in this case, your bio parents are awful people and that is a form of abuse to split up twins. They should have kept both, or had you both adopted out.", "NTA! Not even a little bit. I grew up in the system and your twin has no idea what it feels like to be abandoned and left behind. I am so happy you had a good outcome. You may change your mind as you grow but you may not. Either is ok and NOONE gets to have an opinion but you. There can be deep routed issues you may not even be aware of please seek a therapist that you are comfortable with. And they don't get an opinion either.\nI have a good adult life but my issues snuck up on me in my 30's and I wasn't prepared. I am also fairly self aware and happy. My point is this could stir some subconscious feelings, reach out if you need to to a trusted friend, family ot counselor.", "No nta meet them if you ever feel like it.", "\n\nNo, you are not an asshole. You have obviously gone through a lot of pain and confusion due to this situation and you have the right to decide what is best for you. You are not obligated to meet your twin or your biological parents if you do not want to. It is your life and your decision and you do not owe anyone an explanation for it.", "NTA. Over time you may need health information but if you don't want to meet them, you don't have to. Good luck to you.", "NAH. As an also adopted person I absolutely hate other people trying to force a relationship", "As a birth mom, NTA. Not in this universe or any other. Live your life without worries or guilt, that\u2019s why we (usually) give our babies up. Your true family loves you like crazy, don\u2019t worry at all about any similar DNA.", "NTA. Fellow adoptee and separated twin here, you don\u2019t owe your twin anything.", "NTA. That\u2019s a tough situation anyway you look at it but your twin had nothing to do with it. I get not wanting to deal with your biological parents, but you never know what you could be missing out on.", "NTA.\n\nIt's completely understandable you're not wanting to meet your biological parents or your twin.  I can imagine there being a lot of resentment. It must feel awful feeling like you were given up,  but,  I'm glad you ended up with a family who loved you deeply as their own.  Maybe your biological parents couldn't give you that themselves.  \n\nMaybe one day you'll reconsider a meet up.  You won't be disrespectful in any way to your adopted family by meeting your biological family.  You know who raised you.  You know who your parents are and who your family is.  Nothing will change that except,  your family may grow in time. \n\nAgain, NTA and you may choose to never meet your twin and that is OK. One day your twin may understand your reasons as well.", "NTA. Also your twin is not responsible for his parents actions; try to talk to him about how you feel, put him in your shoes.", "NTA. You don't need to owe an explanation to your twin or your biological parents.   \nGo enjoy your university, and you already have your chosen family being your adopted family.", "NTA, I am adopted as well.  My parents were wonderful to me. My dad's family spoiled me rotten growing up (Mom's family were AH). I have no desire to meet the bio family.  I have not done any of the DNA searches nor will I.  This is a very personal choice. If you are not adopted, you have no business judging this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Learning this information is huge, new and fraught with emotional power.  \n\nYour position is understandable and I believe you\u2019re absolutely within your rights to choose either way.

I never wanted to meet my biological family, and it wasn't great anyway.  My kid found me,  and it was fully their choice \n\nI had parents, and I didn't need more family. My adoptive family isn't perfect, but I love them, and it's enough drama frankly. And after what I went through with my biological family... it changed me.  I promised myself I would leave it up to my kid,   I felt that way before, but this solidified it for me.  \n\nI get what your brother is feeling and what you're feeling. You need to do what you need to do.  And frankly, the lashing out at you isn't cool. He needs to do some work on himself. Don't get me wrong, I get the anger.  But the lashing out isn't good. \n \nYou are allowed to cut this off if it invades your peace.  I had to,  after many horrible things, were said at me that had nothing to do with me and everything to do with them. I still get emails from them occasionally,  and I do read them.  Then delete them and move on.\n\nEdited to remove stuff that's not really mine to share.", "NTA \n\nCompletely your choice.  Other adoptees have given you great feedback so I won't bother with what I know from my mom's experience as an adoptee, it would just be second hand & repeating what others have said and said well....but I will urge you to discuss with your parents and a therapist the possibility of making contact for the purpose of obtaining your biological medical history. \n\nI'm sorry you're faced with this and I hope that whatever you decide,  you thrive as you move into your college career and beyond.", "NTA. It's fully your decision. It makes perfect sense that you'd not want to include that in your life.\nOnly thing I'd say is that it wasn't your twin's decision to give you up for adoption, so they shouldn't be on the receiving end of your displeasure. They did nothing wrong. If you can find it in your heart to see them (and not your biological parents), it could potentially open you up to a close friend.\nSeeing your twin would not be spitting in your real parents' face. It would be you wanting to connect with someone biologically related to you that had nothing to do with the BS of your biological parents.\n\nBut regardless, you don't owe anyone anything and you need to do whatever is best for you. If that means no contact with your twin, then so be it. I wish you a long and happy life.", "NAH.

But you also arent an AH for not wanting to meet him/ or your bio family.", "Just because time has passed, that doesn't mean they are entitled to a relationship.  You have a family and you gave your answer. They don't have to like it, but they do have to respect it. Block your twin, but let him know you can get a restraining order if they keep pursuing it.

It's psychotic and awful to split up twins. They should have kept both, or adopted them both out. I'm surprised they were allowed to split them up tbh.", "I gave birth to twins at 26 weeks. My ds passed at 3 days. My DD is 15 . She actually met someone at 3 and they have created a twin bond. Very odd. But I do feel that one day you may change your mind. Keep in mind it has nothing to do with him. He is as innocent in this as you are honey. And I'm sure your parents would welcome him. They love you and he is a part of you. Your history, genetics, hobbies etc. All I'm saying is give yourself some grace and think on it. Try to get past the anger at HIM.  Hugs and thoughts from an internet stranger", "\u201cIt left me more angry and with more questions\u201d I\u2019ve never been able to explain my feelings about meeting my biological mother but that line sums it up perfectly.

And when I met her I just have more questions and more anger and more\u2026resentment? Not that they gave me up, I\u2019m thrilled they did, best gift they ever gave me. More like I resent that this person is responsible for half my DNA. I don\u2019t want to be associated with her. I don\u2019t want to one day have to tell my children that they might have some nasty surprises lurking in their genetic code (yay hereditary mental health conditions and predisposition to addiction!) \n\nSorry this got to be a ramble.
