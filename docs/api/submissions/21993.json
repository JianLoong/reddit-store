You are allowed to choose the level of relationship you have with your biological relatives and don't owe anybody anything. \n\nI do want to gently push back on something you said, though. It would not be spitting in the face of your parents if you decided on contact with your bio relatives. You love your parents, they love you, and your relationship is based on years of commitment and support. Nobody is going to replace them. It would be more like looking up an estranged second cousin and getting to know them-- they're just somebody you have a genetic connection to, not an act of rejection. \n\nMaybe you'll never want to meet any of them, and that's absolutely fine. I had no desire to connect with my bio family until I had a baby myself, and then I wanted to understand more about why they made that decision. We have occasional contact but nothing deep or profound. Some people never feel that desire. I just want you to try not to think of it as an attack because if your feelings do change one day, it could give you unnecessary guilt.", "The only AH here are your biological parents.. twins have such a unique and intricate bond, keeping one and putting one up for adoption is so fucked.

Maybe one day you will reconsider. Either way, you are fine.", "NTA. I feel likes it's more your biological parent's fault so you can atleast meet up with the twin but your feelings are valid and if the twin is thinking you are an asshole maybe he isn't the best of people and maintaining your distance is better. But even if you try to form a relationship I don't think you would spitting on your family's face as they would understand. Do what you want and feel is right", "NAH. You have the right to decide for yourself who to let into it. But I won't call an 18 year old kid an asshole for wanting to meet his twin. And I cannot judge your biological parents.

Splitting up TWINS? I'm adopted, and I would rarely criticize bio parents unless they kids were taken away for abuse or something along those lines. But in this case, your bio parents are awful people and that is a form of abuse to split up twins. They should have kept both, or had you both adopted out.", "NTA! Not even a little bit. I grew up in the system and your twin has no idea what it feels like to be abandoned and left behind. I am so happy you had a good outcome. You may change your mind as you grow but you may not.

And they don't get an opinion either.\nI have a good adult life but my issues snuck up on me in my 30's and I wasn't prepared. I am also fairly self aware and happy.

Fellow adoptee and separated twin here, you don\u2019t owe your twin anything.", "NTA. That\u2019s a tough situation anyway you look at it but your twin had nothing to do with it.

I can imagine there being a lot of resentment. It must feel awful feeling like you were given up,  but,  I'm glad you ended up with a family who loved you deeply as their own.  Maybe your biological parents couldn't give you that themselves.  \n\nMaybe one day you'll reconsider a meet up.  You won't be disrespectful in any way to your adopted family by meeting your biological family.  You know who raised you.  You know who your parents are and who your family is.

They did nothing wrong. If you can find it in your heart to see them (and not your biological parents), it could potentially open you up to a close friend.\nSeeing your twin would not be spitting in your real parents' face.

That's not good if that's the case.\n\nYou don't owe them anything. I can understand having resentment and not wanting to meet your bio parents but your sibling is literally blameless in everything.

The bottom line, to me, is that you don\u2019t owe a relationship to people who chose to not ever have one with you. Nobody deserves the pain of feeling unwanted, nor should anyone be guilted into amplifying that pain for the sake of biological relation.

It sounds like they were very young, so it may not have been entirely their choice. Plus, at that young age, decisions are made with a completely different mindset than one would, as an adult. You don't know exactly what the actual situation was. Of course it's normal to resent them, and of course your parents, the ones who raised you and set you up on such a successful path, are always going to be your parents, but you might want to give things a bit more thought.

I will never understand his feelings and decisions but I sympathize deeply with him. I miss him too.", "Wait so does that make you feel better? There is truth to the statement yk", "Read his last sentence that his twin \u201cthinks I\u2019m an asshole for not wanting to me him or my biological parents\u201d. Twin can be disappointed but has no right to feel he\u2019s an asshole. I also wouldn\u2019t trust him to not have bio parents secretly show up if OP agreed to meet just with twin", "Your friend was really lucky overall because neonatal herpes can be life-threatening when left untreated, which is why pregnant patients with HSV-2 are usually monitored throughout the pregnancy and put on antivirals to make sure they don\u2019t have a flare during childbirth (when they do have one, a C-section is generally preferred). I\u2019m glad she has a great family!", "Twin is probably dealing with a shock of finding out a big lie his parents have been living and is not reacting well. Meanwhile OP has always known that he is adopted and is used to it so having sudden contact with strangers who insist being his family is somewhat a shock for him\u2026 But in any case twin should back out and ask just for random following each others on social media", ">And yes, I am aware how cynical I sound.\n\nI think reading this sub has made me significantly more cynical regarding the human race.", "I have two adopted cousins. Each adoption process was wildly different.\n\nSadly one of my cousins is a byproduct of SA- his bio mom couldn\u2019t go through with an abortion so she started trying to find adoptive parents for him as soon as she could. She watched hundreds of application videos and chose my aunt and uncle. David* has his mom\u2019s last name as a middle name, is in regular contact with her and her parents. He calls her by name rather than a parental title and they have a good relationship. \n\nHis little sister\u2019s adoption was quite different. My aunt and uncle wanted another child and they were in a long line up of prospective parents. One day they got a phone call, \u201cWe have an 18 month old girl, do you want her?\u201d And they immediately dropped everything and drove across country to meet her and adopt her. Kady*\u2019s mom was high on a bunch of street drugs while she delivered, and had abused alcohol as well through the pregnancy. Kady has never been interested in meeting her birth mother. \n\n(Cousins are both in their late teens now)", "They didn't abandon him. They used the support systems in place to ensure both children had the resources necessary to survive. They didn't put him on a rock in the countryside or some shit.", "My advice would be to do a ton of research. It sounds like you\u2019ve started, which is good. But listen to adoptees most often since they are the ones who will know what it\u2019s like to be adopted. Be willing to go out of your comfort zone during this research. In fact, I\u2019d say that if you are never out of your comfort zone during the research, you\u2019re not doing enough research and/or not doing the right research.", "Love and hugs to you.", "Which one was first: chicken or egg? Are we here because we already were cynical and read these for enjoyment or did reading these make us cynical?", "Yeah but your can tell which option better informed your doctor by the one he went with first. \n \nWhich sucks cause it's an unintentional adoptee tax on your money and time.", "Thank you, but I want to gently suggest that this advice was not asked for or needed. Partly because as I said, I am an adoptee myself, and partly because my comment already demonstrated my willingness to go beyond my comfort zone.", "It just happens! More people need to talk about this weirdly common happenstance.", "Can I get back to you on that?  \ud83d\ude02", "Yep, takes me back to the parenting forums of about 18 years ago.", "Can anyone explain to me why the comment above is being downvoted?", "Maybe clark can help them write a newspaper article"]}
