A lot of people in other countries are shocked by this but for many people who are used to it they find the idea of being a working adults not financially contributing to the household quite terrible. I paid my parents rent as a teenager/young adult. I can't imagine being an adult making money and have my parents pay for everything, I would feel ashamed. Sure its a family house but there are still bills to pay etc", "Depressingly common requirement to pay rent or get the boot at 18, sometimes sooner. It\u2019s rare to take care of family \u201cjust\u201d because you\u2019re related, it\u2019s all business.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s common.\n\nMy point is that OP doesn\u2019t have a lot going on. They should be appreciative they\u2019re able to live rent free and take advantage of that while they can. \n\nCurrently they\u2019re staying up late doing not much of anything, working 10 hours a week, and about to start working at a fast food restaurant with their newly earned college degree", "It's very strange to me tbh. I'm 27 and still home.", "I don't really know anyone who was forced to pay rent like that, or at least not anyone who talked about it.  The only time I really heard about it was when there was sort of a failure to launch kind of scenario, or if the family was really struggling financially and everyone bringing in money was expected to contribute.", "It depends on the family, my parents didn\u2019t make me pay rent but I gave ~$150 a month to add to the pay-bill pile. But I also was on the chore rotation, did all the grocery shopping and most meal planning, and helped out in the kitchen. \n\nI think most American parents don\u2019t want to have to charge rent but sometimes can\u2019t afford not too.", "Not uncommon. And it\u2019s not always in the form of money. Like my brother lived at home till he was 27. Basically, he needed to act like another adult member of the household with similar responsibilities AND work towards saving up for his own place. As long as he was working, helping out, and saving- he could live their rent free as long as he needed to. While my two siblings and I know we are welcome back at my parents home, it\u2019s still understood that it\u2019s *their* home. Not a family home that we can just come back to and expect them to accommodate us.", "It certainly can, and some of my friends never made it back either. And some of my friends that are back are just not the same. Sorry to hear abiut your husband though.\n\nI believe OP is in Australia, so a much slower rate of deployments and not to as many hot zones as the US and UK.", "Quality jobs take time to find. Are you looking for a restaurant job for minimum wage or a professional role in your line of work with a required skill set and a specific salary range in mind. One of those you can shoot off a few resumes in 15 min and call it a day. And the other takes considerable time to perfect", "I mean, assuming they go to bed at midnight or earlier, that\u2019s not unreasonable. Though when I last read the thread, OP was only working 10 hrs a week\u2026", "they\u2019re working 2 days, 10 hours a week, living rent free (i assume, since op seems to be dodging that question), and evidently staying up all night. \n\ni\u2019m a college drop out that works in the trades so i can\u2019t speak to the job market for jobs you need a degree for, but i do understand that depending on the field, you can\u2019t just waltz into a job in your work force. \n\nbut plenty of people have that issue\u2026 and they go and get a full time job in a different field to pay the bills until then. most parents would be frustrated seeing their kid live at home, working 10 hours a week, and sleeping the day away.", "Unless I am missing something, 10hrs of work a week isn\u2019t really what I am talking about.", "I\u2019m not in desperate need of one and also have a disability that makes certain jobs not possible for me. I\u2019m also applying mostly within my field and have a small bit of financial help. Thanks for your concern\n\nEdit to add: the fact that 75-100 applications is \u201clow\u201d shows that finding a job right now is not as easy as it seems or used to be.", "Good for them", "Are you putting genuine effort into applications and actually applying regularly? Doesn\u2019t add up", "No it actually does. When I was hiring, people sending their resume in the evening hours was a red flag for me. Why are you emailing at midnight? If there was current employment on the resume I might consider that as an excuse but otherwise it just seems like an unprofessional behaviour in my opinion.", "They had plenty of networking opportunities online I know this because I am working and going to school during lockdown they still had virtual events. Also linked in is a thing. You sound lazy tbh. Your parents seem to be pushing you because they want to you to be an adult .", "I didn\u2019t have networking opportunities in college and took any job I could. I\u2019ve worked really shit jobs, but it\u2019s all part of growing up. School doesn\u2019t guarantee a career out the gate, but a degree and a work history will help a hell of a lot more than what you\u2019re doing now", "Did you work an internship?", "I'm Irish too, as soon as I graduated mam was looking for rent, and it seemed common amongst friends", "In my experience a lot of American parents don't actually enforce the \"you're 18, leave\". Of course there are some that do but those tend to be households that have abusive elements already. Mine and my friend's parents used it more as a threat, as in follow the house rules or feel free to go. As for rent- some never had to pay anything, some were expected to contribute to grocery bills / a utility bill, and some were asked to pay a small amount (those asked to pay a full share would end up renting with roommates instead, because at that point why would you stay).", "Can I ask how much you paid if you don\u2019t mind telling me? My parents charged me \u201crent\u201d but to this day I\u2019m not sure if it was a reasonable amount or not. One thing is for sure - it made it very difficult for me to save enough to move out.", "interesting, thanks, made me glad i\u2019m not american lol", "So how much exposure are you offering OP?", "So it's not hard to get a job and be paid. Something is better than being a bum", "You know you'd also interact with your family less if you actually had a full time job", "I honestly don\u2019t understand why this was downvoted. It seems like an appropriate solution.", "If you want to interact less and not follow rules, then move out.", "Weird.", "I mean if you\u2019re willing and able to, sure. I am not able to, nor will I be exploited like many of those companies do to their employees. Excuse me for believing that someone with a college degree is worth a little more than fast food working conditions and pay. This isn\u2019t what this thread is about, but go and point fingers and call people names.", "A not insignificant number of redditors will go through and DV multiple posts from a person after seeing one thing from them that they didn't agree with. Honestly, that's not even how downvoting on reddit is supposed to work. People use it when they disagree with you, but it's supposed to be reserved for toxic people like the ones who are making racist, homophibic sort of comments. The subreddits rules even clarify that issue, but it's not like many people actually read through them.", "When was the last time you applied for a job? 1972? Go ahead and customize your resume for each job and write a tailored cover letter. Spend those hours doing that. Click your email inbox and you\u2019ll have an automated rejection from a no-reply within minutes.", "That's a great way to get banned from a store.", "Hi! Here in reality, getting a low level job is much harder with a degree because they know you'll leave when a better opportunity appears. They want people without options.", "Should bury this comment so people don\u2019t understand.", "Honestly. Hours tailoring your CV and cover letter to each job application? Wtf? lol. Serious Boomer energy. I haven't tailored my resume to any particular position in years, let alone drafted a cover letter.", "Depends on the job your applying to. If it\u2019s a highly qualified/professional job then it\u2019s 100% worth the effort. If it\u2019s a retail position then yeah, nobody cares. Tailoring your resume to get through the first automatic screening is more important than ever before. You need to get those keywords in", "Maybe region dependent, but in Ireland, if you are applying for a job, its incredibly common that they will run all applications through software, which screens applications for certain criteria and trashes the rest. A lot of the time, the phrasing in the advert is a huge clue as to what they will be screening for, allowing you to make sure you pass screening (or at least prevent your application being incorrectly dismissed).", "2022 and I got both of the jobs I applied for. Why would tailoring your CV to a specific job advert ever be obsolete?", "why? You don\u2019t have to be pushy, you can be friendly and obviously accept no for an answer. I know several people who got jobs this way", "Is that how it is in the US? Never heard of this where I'm from. In Norway you can stop by, say hi and give your CV to them. No problem here. Worst thing that happens here is that they say \"sorry, we don't have any openings\". Not saying she should go in and demand a job, just a quick, friendly hi, say your name and ask if they might be hiring soon. I don't know where OP lives, but I don't assume everyone on Reddit is American. Weird how different we react to strangers here and in the US.", "not sure where OP is located, but where i am, the fast food and retail industries are outright DESPERATE for workers. \n\nis the pay shit? yes. but the paychecks are a lot more than the paycheck of a 10 hour per week job. unless OP has glaring red flags, i have a very hard time believing they can\u2019t find a simple minimum wage job.", "It\u2019s surely the opposite of boomer energy. Getting a job these days is difficult so why on earth would you not put in any effort in an application?", "Glad it's not just where I live that it's ok to ask politely. I'm Norwegian though, and I guess it might be different in other countries, but it wouldn't be seen as harassment or anything like that where I live."]}
