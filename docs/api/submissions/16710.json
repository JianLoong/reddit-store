Everyone wants you to have a degree and have experience in that position already, even if you're a newly graduate.\n\nSo I can understand OP struggling to find a full time job related to their degree, especially as a newly graduate.", "I saw someone else say that; I truly don\u2019t see how it matters what time someone applies for a job. If most companies still did paper applications and one had to go in during business hours, that\u2019d make sense. If it\u2019s a red flag that someone is applying for a job at midnight because it means they\u2019re a loaf who stays up all night, it can also be said that it\u2019s a red flag someone applying for a job at 9 am because they\u2019re applying for other jobs while they\u2019re most likely at their current job; therefore, they are bad employees. It\u2019s arbitrary. We absolutely still hold onto this antiquated idea that getting up early means being more productive.", "I used to work nights and my parents would make me get up at 8 the next morning so I can \"get ready for the day\" when I would be extremely exhausted from not sleeping till like 3 and be in pain.\n\nNow I have a 9 to 5 job, and it's still a struggle to go to bed at a reasonable time and wake up to not be late because I'm a night person.", "She's working two days a week, not full time. It's not nearly the same thing. ND there's no reason to be staying up til 1a. In this situation. Been there,regularly did those off at closing shifts and was still in bed those days by midnight. Being up at 8 is still the recommended 8 hours of sleep", "10pm and a 5 hour shift is not late hours. Two kids under 4, work 10 hour days to support the family. Get up at 5am and go to bed around 11pm. It's not glamorous or ideal but it pays the bills and provides for the littles. Claiming getting up at 8am after getting off at 10 is horse shit. Even if you take 3 hours to relax after, that's 7 hours of sleep.", "In much the same way that paying another adult's living expenses so that they can work 10 hours a week or less is insane.\n\nPossibly after paying for that adult's college experience, as well.", "OP doesn\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t need to live there.", "OP said in an earlier comment that what they\u2019ve been doing for job searching is sending out 4-10 resumes on an online site in the evenings. I do that much sitting at my current job when ive got a slow hour lol. Sorry but it does not sound like OP is actively doing the most that they can to get a job. Yes finding a job is hard, no doubt there. But from OP\u2019s comments they haven\u2019t really been trying very hard", "So they aren't vacuuming when others are trying to sleep? Cleaning is actually fairly noisy in general.", "exactly this! i feel like i'm going insane reading all these YTA comments fully ignoring the context OP is providing. do all these people think you can just go get a job immediately because you put your mind to it?", "Why not? Unless they have a super long commute, that could easily mean some time to unwind and then get in a good night's sleep.", "The post makes the answer apparent and it\u2019s even from the perspective of OP.", "Do you even know where they live? Why would you assume they have the same graduation schedule as you?", "OP Said in another comment she\u2019s in AU, they follow the same schedule as the calendar year and she would have likely completed her study by June.", "I applied to a hospital job, no experience required or education over HS, ignored. Checked back a month later and the listing was still up along with about 2,000 other job openings. It\u2019s fucking stupid.", "10 hours a week? You must be doing a lot of chores each week to make up for the free rent.", "As someone whose worked 2nd shift for 9 years, this completely resonated with me. I have no choice but to look for a job that will start between 7-8:30am in a few months. Im utterly terrified.", "Yup, I'm a night owl and I work a day job that has me up earlier than I would like. It's not that I can't wake up at 4am sometimes when I need to, but I'd rather get up at noon and go to work at 3pm. I was much happier back then, but I can't afford to only work short evening shifts and getting to work at 11am is doable enough. I'm still a slug some mornings and I don't always get up when I want t get chores done, but it's way better than when I had classes at 8am. I COULD NOT FUNCTION FOR FOUR YEARS.", "Imagine having a child, helping that child grow and then, as soon as they become an adult, you decide \"I'm going to make arbitrary rules because this is just another adult I'm paying for.\" This isn't a random adult, this is their child. As a parent you are to help prepare your child and give them the best chance at success in life, that often includes covering their expenses while they are in college and shortly after because it takes time to find a job", "do you know what career counseling OP has had access to? do you know how long each of these applications takes them? if you don't, then what you're saying is based on assumptions and your personal experience, and you're not giving them a fair shake.\n\npersonally, i remember most of the applications taking at least 45 minutes *each* the first few times i had to find a job. low-level service jobs at fast food places and retail stores. they all asked several short answer questions and a lot of multiple choice ones, and required me to write out the same information i had in my resume. and that shit got exhausting fast. if that's similar to OP's situation, i think they are trying hard enough for their parents to get off their back.", "At target or Walmart or a restaurant.  Absolutely.  They can be employed at a job while they search for a career type job.  Instead of spending an entire year doing absolutely nothing.", "should a working person applying for a job send in resumes during their current job\u2019s hours instead of waiting until they\u2019re home?", "Yikes! I wish you good luck in this endeavor.  It will be rough and might be worth working with your physician earlier rather than later since you know it's going to affect you.", "And while you're covering their expenses (whether they are 5 or 15 or 25) you get to make \"arbitrary\" rules that you think will benefit them long term. As a child you don't have much recourse, but as an adult you can choose to strike out on your own if you disagree", "They\u2019ve been an adult for 5 years now. Allowing them to be a lazy slacker isn\u2019t helping.", "I'm imagine making a variety of financial sacrifices to put a child through college, perhaps while they lecture you about how you don't understand, and their majoring in whatever is far more wise than you know.  And then they can't get a job, and don't appear to show any interest in working more than 10 hours a week, and sleep in every day while you head off to work to pay the mortgage/rent/food bills that allow that child to slack off.\n\nI personally rarely showed up at the office before 10am (and often 11am) for 30 years, so I'm sympathetic about sleeping in.  But I'd then stay in the office 'til 7pm or 8pm.  Absent a job, OP doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.\n\nThe parents are obviously running out of ideas.  It may be that they contributed to this.  But OP, YTA.", "They forget they'll get old one day. My mother is 87. Her karma has swung full back.", "That seems similar to American families, or at least the families I know.  The \"rent\" is the equivalent of a few Bob/one-third of what they earn.\n\nMost families aren't going to charge more than that, but if they aren't going to school or training and they aren't working, Americans do \"incentivize\" their kids after a while.", "I've been in and out of school, 3rd degree incoming. It's pretty hard to get a job here as a graduate. Most people leave the country. I've held part time jobs but nothing in my field.", "Not necessarily but in the past I\u2019ve had the email prepped and on draft and then sent on break or lunch hour. Just one option.", "I wasnt talking about her directly. But we also dont know if she has those issues", "So if you\u2019re not at the point of being able to support yourself financially you\u2019re a child and therefore your body autonomy is no longer a thing? \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to gain employment which in some places can be ridiculously difficult and have a \u201ccasual\u201d (I\u2019m assuming this means either a part time or zero hour contract) and are living with your parent whilst this happens then that doesn\u2019t give them the right to tell you what time you need to be awake everyday unless there\u2019s an actually reason or is pre-agreed but saying \u201cyou need to be up by 9am everyday because you don\u2019t pay rent and successful people get up at 9am everyday\u201d is completely unreasonable and although I can see that the intention is meant to be motivating them to get more employment it doesn\u2019t change the fact that as an adult you can choose when to get up and no one has the right to tell you when that is", "Here people who pay rent need to pay for food and bills too besides rent. Rent is something you pay just to live somewhere", "But you help out around the house? Cooking, cleaning, doing your own laundry? \n\nThe problem with a lot of young people is they expect to be taken care of like they were before they became adult and their parents feel like they have no reason to leave.", "sometimes, people with really good work ethic are stuck in jobs that demand up to 16 hour days, and they go home and look for something that is more consistent. i know plenty of people who got stuck in a saturated job market who worked way above job description and never had any free time, or their company\u2019s hours went until late. applying at that time might mean they\u2019re looking for something that offers a little more stability in their schedule", "Is it their own bed they paid for? With sheets they bought with their own money? Which they then clean with water they paid for with the monthly utilities? While the lights are on because they paid the electric? If OP works 10 hours a week or less, I think not. As you pointed out, there is a difference between being an actual child and acting like a child.", "By \"end of day,\" I was not referring to  specific time. I was referring to a short activity that is not a large portion of your day and one that takes a short amount of time before your bedtime, whenever that is. \n\nThis job search should be a priority during OP's productive hours - whenever that is. It shouldn't be an afterthought near bedtime.", "Again I\u2019m not saying it was a deal breaker for me. I understand that it\u2019s difficult to juggle long hours while looking for a better option. Trust me! My point is, again, that OP is not having luck and needs to refine his practices. This is one small thing that OP could do, to increase his success. Furthermore, there are breaks in every job. If you have time to prep the email at midnight, it literally takes 2 seconds to save it in draft and another 2 seconds to hit send the next day. All this sounds like a lot of excuses and I also got a ton of that while hiring. Again, I won\u2019t apologize for being picky.", "Actually boomers didn't do that. When boomers were applying resumes and shit were supposed to be generic for all of them, because it was just to supposed to be skillset stuff and job history. Tailoring is a millennial job market thing", "Idk man, when I was trying to get my first job I applied to nearly every single fast food/retail job within a 10 minute drive (I was living with my dad at the time and he was my ride, I didn\u2019t want to burden him with a longer drive) and only one responded to me, and I wasn\u2019t hired. Give or take 100 applications and not even a response from most. In my experience it can just genuinely be difficult to get a job, even when the places appear desperate."]}
