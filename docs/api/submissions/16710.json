If you\u2019re sleeping till noon you\u2019re lying to yourself about how hard you\u2019re trying.", "All I'm seeing is a lot of excuses.  \n\nYou can find a job that doesn't require a college degree, get hired and still apply to more jobs that are appropriate to your education.\n\nEdit: downvote me all you like but part of a successful resume for an \"adult\" job is having a work history.  10 hours of week, which is the lowest end of part time employment, shows me someone who doesn't have much ambition to make money.\n\nAs of right now you have free housing and food, this is an opportunity that you won't have once you move out into the real world.  You should be hustling as hard as you can to save up because everything is expensive as hell.", "You should use that time in the morning, where you stated that you get nothing productive done, to try and find the job that will get you out and into your own place.", "I work shifts and have to deal with family not understanding that after a night shift im not being lazy being in bed at midday (which is effectively midnight for me) so i know what its like. Good luck finding jobs and hopefully you can find one you want to stick with for a long time.", "If they saw you \u2018do more\u2019 they may back off. \n\nMy parents were nightmares when I graduated.\nThey were pissed because they thought I was \u2018*choosing*\u2019 not to do more and would nitpick everything I did.\n\nThey backed off a lot when I got a volunteer role (one day a week) at a local charity.  They saw that as me \u2018taking things seriously\u2019. \n\nDoing volunteer work would also look great on your CV and give you the opportunity to network.", "What \u201cindependence skills\u201d do you lack?", "Maybe look for a night shift job?  Do you have a local hospital? Mine can't seem to keep night clerk and night cleaners, so there are often openings.", "OP works not even 10 hours a week. A WEEK. \n\n>I have a casual job that has shifts that start at 5pm on a weekday and result in me getting home around 10pm\n\nShift starts at 5pm. They get HOME at 10. That means they aren't working until 10pm. So more like 8-9 hours a week.", "That they work at 2 days a week. Doesn't even describe it as part time, but \"casual\"", "Less than 10 hours of work a week is technically a job but that's barely any income at all.", "Yeah I was going to say that if they're asleep by midnight and up at 8, that's still 8 hrs of sleep which for a 22 year old should still be more than enough.", "Literally nothing of what you describe has to be started at 8am. Some people just stay late and get up late.\n\nAlso - I have experience from finding a job for months when I switched careers. There is only so much effort you can give it every day/week, before you get crazy.\n\nSome things take time - recruiters consider it ok to answer after weeks if not months, new job postings don't appear every day. Once I even hurt my chances, as I learned - I was agile enough to respond to several similar postings only to later find out they were the same position posted by different recruiters. Getting the same CV from more sources is a red flag for whatever reason.\n\nAnd walking around and applying in person? Sorry grandma, that's not how it works nowadays...", "I really hope I get some more money and work soon. B has been threatening to kick me out a lot. C and B can be quite overbearing which I find draining and they aren't the easiest people to live with. \n\nSometimes I find C is trying to impose his idea of how he thinks I should be and that can make it difficult to determine whether what he is asking me to do is actually in my best interest. With the way things have been lately, I may as well be ahead of the curb and be prepared for when they kick me out so it doesn't harm me as much when it happens.\n\nThey aren't entirely reasonable. Like me, C is stubborn and has this idea in his head of how things should be and B at times can be emotionally abusive.", "I have actually offered to email them a copy of every job application I do but they always say no.", "I've seen this discussed many times, and the vast majority in charge of hiring have said they'll immediately toss your resume in the rejection pile for an inability to follow instructions to apply online only. I imagine that could vary depending on your location or career field, but walking in could genuinely hinder their job prospects.", "I don't dispute that. I don't expect my first full time job to be great. I'm turning down jobs. They are turning down me. The only exception was this one guy who wanted me to take naked photos and do sexual stuff with other people. I turned down that one pretty quickly and C and B were happy for me to turn that one down. Might reconsider it if I still continue to be unlucky with jobs and/or get kicked out.", "Yeah I had a younger relative living with me singing the \u201cno one wants to hire me\u201d song. I drove her one day while she was filling out applications. She was wearing her jacket with one sleeve on and one sleeve off, dragging behind her almost on the ground. They had a paper application and she didn\u2019t have a pen. After we made it clear that she couldn\u2019t stay with us anymore because she hadn\u2019t done her part (schoolwork, look for a job), she returned a paper application that she had in hand for weeks and had a call back next day. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this is you, OP. But I am saying that, if you were a judgmental person watching your actions from the outside, which of your behaviors might look like \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually want to get a job\u201d? Stop doing those. Sleeping until the afternoon is on the list.", "I have done volunteer work in past so I could definitely do it again. I guess for the last few years, I've been in survival mode and only thought of getting to the next stage which in my case was graduating university. I've just been concerned about the uncertainly I guess. I'm also what is known as a mid year graduate in Australia which is something that puts me at a disadvantage.", "Apparently waking up on time", "I should look into that. Thank you for the idea.", "And those 2 days a week aren't even a full shift. \n\nThey say they start at 5 and \"get home\" around 10pm. That means work is done before 10pm. So really working only 8-9 hours.", "Historically I would do it 2 days a week although earlier this year, they barely offered any shifts due to the nature of the business I have this job with. I got the job while I was in university and have kept it since. I graduated university mid to late last year. \n\nI have had other jobs while also having this job although those jobs have been temporary contract jobs and one job I had for a period last year with my uncle which I left because he was awful to work with and took the philosophy of 'figure it out yourself' to the extreme. \n\nFor example, putting me in a manual car and telling me to attempt to drive it despite me never driving a manual car and as a result, me crashing it into a bush.", "Asking for you to wake up at 9 and probably help out around the house and get you to apply for jobs and be more productive is not unreasonable. They are trying to push you to get work", "So it definitely sucks not getting along with your parents. But to me it really sounds like they're getting tired of you living in their home rent free and them seeing a lack of actual effort or change from you. That's why they're being so \"overbearing\" and naggy. you're 22, the excuse start to get old. \n\nI saw from some comments that you've been applying but haven't been successful in getting anything. What kind of jobs are you applying to?", "For what it's worth, I also went through this with my parents and my therapist said its more important to have a regular sleep schedule than one that conforms to societal norms. Perhaps look for night work it could suit you better and it means you interact with the people you live with less.", "That doesn\u2019t necessarily get to the point of my statement. Are you applying for 1 job a day? Or 1 job a week? Big difference in effort applying for 4 jobs a month vs applying for 20-30 jobs a month. You should be thinking of job hunting like a full time job. Spend 8 hours a day then relax just like you would if you were working. Or set a goal of 1 resume/day or something like that", "There are no retail jobs in your area?", "For real.  There's nothing stopping OP from finding a shitty job and shooting out applications at the same time.\n\nIt's never been easier to apply for things as it is now.  You can sit down on a website like indeed/monster/linkdn and fire off 5 or 6 applications in an hour.  Applying to jobs doesn't have to eat up an entire day.", "I hear you. I was exhausted towards the end of my degree. I was just trying to get through the day. I had friends with loads of post-graduation plans\u2026 honestly I couldn\u2019t think that far ahead because I was just so fucking tired and desperately just wanted to get past the *next essay/exam/assignment*. \n\nI think a volunteer role would be really good for you. I hope you don\u2019t mind me saying, but it sounds like your lacking a bit of confidence at the moment. Is that correct? \n\nIt will give you some certainty about your schedule, will help you develop new skills and allow you get out of the house. \n\nPost-graduation sucks. Sorry you\u2019re having a rubbish time.", "I can get myself up at a certain time if I need to. I have never had a problem getting myself to school, university, previous jobs, job interviews, etc on time. I just like to sleep in when I don't have those things.", "Okay? And?", "At the end of the day, I check this online website and apply for 4 to 10 jobs each night.", "There are and I have applied for them.", "Yes. I can get pretty anxious. It definitely works against me in interviews.", "So what are \u201cindependent skills\u201d that you lack", "Job searching is NOT an \"end of the day\" activity and don't limit yourself to a SINGLE website. That website isn't panning out. \n\nThis is your fulltime job, as the other person said. You need to be putting in several hours a day scouring the internet for jobs - LinkedIn, Indeed, company's websites, your university's career center, MonsterJobs, SimplyHired, Glassdoor, etc. Those are just ones I can think of off the top of my head. \n\nWhen you aren't searching, you should be seeking opportunities to improve your resume - fill in any gaps you have. You mentioned having a degree in Business. Universities typically have career offices to help. Have you done practice interviews? Had them review your resume? Have you done any networking?\n\nAre you personalizing your resume to the jobs you're applying for? Is it keyword optimized? Have you reached out to companies you may have worked with while in college (internships, projects for school, etc)? \n\nJob searching is SO much more than just sending a blank email with your resume attached.", "Then you should be able to show them this and they should get off your back. \n\nHOWEVER just some advice on the job hunt: 4-10 jobs a night is A LOT. And that doesn\u2019t sound like very high quality resumes are being sent out. You should tailoring your resume to every application AND  you should be writing a cover letter for each. (granted they are worth it ie. for professional jobs not for fast food jobs). I have about 4 different resumes that have slightly different tones in them depending on what I\u2019m applying for.", "Have you had many interviews? Have they given you feedback afterwards?\n\nI get really anxious during interviews. If you start to worry and get your words muddled, there\u2019s no shame in saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry, would you mind if start this answer again? I got my words mixed up\u2019.", "More how to pay a bill, how to apply for a rental and that type of thing. I seem to struggle with filling out forms and that type of thing.", "I've offered to send the email receipt for each application to B and C but they always say no and that they don't want their inboxes inundated.", "I have had quite a few interviews and have been getting more interviews recently. Recently I've started asking for feedback and they say I've done nothing wrong or say I'm a bit nervous.", "How does one struggle to fill out a form?", "Yeah I honestly wouldn\u2019t want that either\u2026 if you\u2019re applying for 4-10 a night that\u2019s a lot of emails I would never look at. \u2026. How about you just verbally give them a report in the morning? \u201cHi Dad and Step-mom, last night I applied for 4 jobs, 3 of them were fast food but 1 was marketing related.\u201d", "It\u2019s great that you\u2019re getting interviews and asking for feedback. \n\nIf they say you some across as nervous\u2026. Check your body language. Make sure you don\u2019t fidget, mess with your hair and keep your hands visible (no folding arms). \n\nAsk your friends what your nervous habits are and do practice interviews.", "I don't know. Sometimes I misread things and feel like the words and letters are jumping all over the page. It's just never been my strong point.", "We don't really interact in the morning. B is difficult to be around and I always feel like I am walking on eggshells around her. It's best I not interact from personal experience.", "If words and letters jump all over the page, you should look into whether you have dyslexia."]}
