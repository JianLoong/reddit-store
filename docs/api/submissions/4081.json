Your brother shouldn't get to decide her priorities.\n\nI get their frustration though and to them it was a small ask. You might ask your brother what he plans to do when this happens again in the future? What has he done in the past? Surely it wasn't the first time the baby needed changing at an inopportune time. What would he have done if your daughter had already left? It might get him rethinking making you leave. If you do stay, I would make it clear that you'll help when you're home, but your daughter isn't comfortable around babies and you don't want to force it. \n\nINFO: If you were in your brother's situation (your infant child and your daughter wouldn't change the diaper bc she was late for a party, causing you to miss out on a critical work event or let's say a chance at a promotion!), would you have tried to make your 18yo do it and been majorly pissed when she didn't? Or would you have accepted it and respected her choice?", "If you and your daughter have been staying with your brother for three months, both of you should have been helping out with the baby.

I imagine you're doing so at a reduced cost.  Because of this, the proper thing to do is help out with small things like changing a diaper from time to time.  Honestly, I don't care that your daughter is uncomfortable with babies.  In life, sometimes you have to deal with shit that's uncomfortable and no one is around to hold your hand.  It's your job as a parent to teach your child how to deal with those kinds of situations.  If she didn't know how to change a diaper, that's one thing and excusable.  But if she has done it and knows how, it wouldn't have killed her.  \n\nYou didn't need to go off and yell at your brother either.

Your daughter didn't *have* to help with the diaper in any legal sense, but in a \"just being a good person\" sense. No where in your post did you mention 1) paying rent, 2) going out of your way to do other things around the house, 3) anything previously agreed as off-limits.  \n\nA  diaper change is a 5 second, minimal task, and it sounds like your daughter\u2014who has not previously expressed an aversion to being around babies\u2014was making up an excuse so she could get to a party. At the very least, she hasn't been so uncomfortable around babies to make living in a house with her baby cousin a hardship before now.  \n\nI hope you read some of the comments in here and use them to form an apology to your brother and his girlfriend (preferably from both you and your daughter). Unlike some of the more callous assholes here, I don't want to see you thrown out on your ass for having a simple disagreement among family members. You were in the wrong, but that doesn't need to be the end of the story.

I did not grow up with babies in my life, I certainly had never been taught how to change one, I was highly anxious about ever hurting or dropping them or making them cry, and so I was always profoundly uncomfortable when people tried to hand me a baby with the expectation I would want to hold it and 'naturally' knew how to do so.\n\nWhat would your brother have done if your daughter had already left? What happens if his baby has a more urgent need when he's alone in the house and in a work meeting?

Do they have no plan for childcare??\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH -- everyone except that poor baby who seems to be an afterthought for all the adults in this household. And yes, the 18 year old is an adult too and more than capable of thinking of others before herself. \n\nI work from home and have a 15 month old. I usually have care arranged.

Old enough to find her own housing is she can't help out for 5 minutes.", "I see it as ESH because it\u2019s all being done in such a reactionary way. Brother needs a better childcare arrangement for his 9mo child than watching her on a monitor while he works from home, and then hoping he can draft his niece to help without any warning or agreement. But OP and their daughter are living there by his grace, and digging in with some kind of \u201cno right to expect help\u201d isn\u2019t an appropriate approach either.

There\u2019s no obligation to help with the baby, but there is courtesy to the folks housing you, especially when they\u2019re dealing with a baby.

Housing is expensive and requires maintenance -cleaning, repairs, etc. If the OP isn't paying rent or utilities, they aren't providing care for their own child, the brother is. To ask for a return of the favor, care for his own child for 5 minutes (all the teens 'waiting outside' have phones and can either give her tips or just chill on their phone before the party - not going to take SATs, not catching a plane, a party!) is not a big deal. She just didn't want to get her hands dirty.", "What baffles me is the way people are treating them as two different family units.. That kid in diapers is the OPs niece as well and the 18yo is her elder cousin.\n\nObviously this situation requires more context of previous interactions/arrangements but if you are sharing the same roof with a family for 3 months you better step up/chip in.", "I also wonder if brother would have asked the 18YO to change the diaper if OP happened to have a son as opposed to a daughter. A lot of men immediately defer to women for child care even when they are the father and the woman present isn\u2019t responsible for the child.", "My thoughts exactly. If he can't step away for 5min. Than there should have been a full time supervisor at home. Not an 18yo in a rush with presumebly no experience. Sounds like bad communication. Good that you stood up for your daughter. But there is something missing from the story. Please fill the gaps", "I share your concerns.  I WFH and my MIL watches my 5m old. When the baby was a newborn WFH without help was easier because the baby sleeps most the day. Now that the baby is older and stays up longer, interaction and constant supervision is required.  I wonder how this nanny-cam approach to caring for the baby will hinder her development?", "Thank you. I was amazed at how many people are justifying this in the comments. \n\nWhat dis the brother have for childcare before OP and OP\u2019s daughter moved in? \n\nWhy did he assume OP\u2019s daughter would be comfortable with changing a diaper without communicating with her beforehand?", "I'm honestly kind of concerned here about the number of people here who seen to think the daughter not doing this one thing (whether it was justified or not) is a genuinely a good enough reason to just kick out loved ones that need a place to stay. Like, if you're staying in someone's house, you should be grateful and help out when you can\n.... But do people really think this means if you can't/don't one time you deserve to be kicked out and homeless? If someone was staying with me and mostly doing the right thing and couldn't help out one time like that, I wouldn't think of berating or kicking them out. The number of people on here who think that's a reasonable response to someone staying with you as soon as you can't help them out genuinely concerns me.", "Yup.

What was the brother's contingency plan for childcare while he was alone in the house? Based on the post, he would have been kicked out of his meeting regardless.  \n\nIf the brother works in a position that is so rigid he cannot step away from the computer, he and his partner absolutely should have found a more sustainable alternate child care arrangement. If this was a super special one-off extra important meeting (thus why the brother couldn't step away and got booted from it for needing a personal moment), then he should have conveyed to OP and their daughter in advance that he really needs some assistance from 1-3pm (or whenever) because of an important meeting and then schedules could have been arranged. But shouting at the daughter as she was actively leaving the house for pre-arranged plans, with people waiting to pick her up outside, while she was likely dressed up for the party, and what sounds like no prior knowledge of how to change a diaper, seems like a pretty cruel thing to make two family members homeless over.", "Thank you, I was so surprised that no one else had pointed out that it seems that this poor baby was supposed to be just alone in her crib or play area while her dad was wfh. I am not giving judgment but I'm feeling sorry for the baby.", "I\u2019m wondering if her teen was his childcare plan and she\u2019s simply over it at this point?

I hope she and daughter find a better situation.", "This is what\u2019s important here. This is not a newborn that has the potential to sleep for a significant portion of the day, outside of feeds and changes; this is a 9 month old baby - that is absolutely not a situation you can mix with working from home. A nine month old needs interaction as well as near constant monitoring as they\u2019re more than likely mobile.\n\nIt seems that either brother and girlfriend have childcare that wasn\u2019t available that day, the child is left to entertain herself for a significant amount of time during the work days when the girlfriend has shifts (in a playpen/in the room with brother or whatever, one would hope at the very least) or brother isn\u2019t giving anywhere near as much time to his job as he should be when this happens.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say either way whether OP is paying rent to the brother, but it doesn\u2019t seem that any childcare was part of the deal for them living there.   I guess it would have been nice of the daughter to try to change the baby before she left, but I\u2019m not sure I even would have wanted a teen relative with no experience at all of caring for a child to change my baby tbh. As others have said, what would he have done if she\u2019d already left? What has he done other times that he\u2019s been working and caring for his daughter at the same time?\n\nIf this was literally a one-off, there\u2019s normally childcare in place or brother\u2019s working days never normally coincide with gf\u2019s shifts, etc then it\u2019s a different question.

I think the situation is a bit different when the one you're asking the favor to is a member of your family, specially if said member is crashing at your house rent free. Parents do everything for their kids without not taking care of the other aspects of their own personal/professional lives.

The 18-yo girl is being expected to be comfortable around babies and okay with changing a diaper (the figuring out how to do it part is actually rather irrelevant, cause obv she could find that out), which quite frankly is sexist as fuck (newsflash, not all women like babies or are okay handling them).\n\nAlso, this is so far from a clear cut case of infantilizing women that I don't think you even know what that fenomenon is about.", "This is often how assholes kind of win.

My husband has been doing a job he absolutely adores since about September. We live in a small community where living wages are impossible to find so he worked his ass off to find something remote and that he could commit to (he was also changing careers, it was a stressful time looking for that work). \n\nANYWAY. We were both very, very paranoid about the office expectations. Got into a couple fights because I take care of the three daughters and he doesn't have a separate office, it's our bedroom. He wanted to put a lock on from the inside and I was like - uh no, you're not going to lock me out of my own bedroom. And I do have two teenagers and I have a very small step daughter. So my husband is my helpmate, and I just have to get the timing right. Neither of us, have *ever* expected the older kids to do anything primary for the 5-yr-old. We *always* ask, and if they say no, that's their freedom and we move onto the next plan. (I think this comes from childhood. Where I had a younger brother who is only fifteen months younger than me. But I ran the household. I mean cooking, cleaning, making sure he's safe. Being the latchkey kid fucking sucked). \n\nMy god do I tell long winded stories. ALL OF THAT TO SAY - about maybe two weeks into my husband's training, they were in a meeting. And he gets up to go to the bathroom. And he starts hacking away at some phlegm. He sort of does that really loud nasal clear too. And then blew his nose (it's as a loud as a trumpet). He didn't have video on, but one of his coworkers in his ear goes: hey, not to interrupt your performance or anything, which was great, but would you mind muting yourself? \n\nGod I'm crying laughing just retelling this. I think my point is, most of us want to be team players. If you get punitive marks for needing to change a diaper... maybe it's time to find somewhere a little more adaptable \ud83d\ude33", "Not impossible, but his other reactions here don't fill me with confidence that this isn't his character paying dividends.", "Especially considering, the daughter wasn't supposed to be there when he asked.

Not running errands, not doing chores, not taking care of kids. Working. A friend of mine and a cousin both got fired for taking 'company time' to attend to 'personal needs'.

It\u2019s not about what the favor was, it\u2019s the fact the girl can\u2019t be bothered to help her uncle who is quite literally going out on a limb to help her and her mom. The fact they can\u2019t even help with a small thing would speak volumes in my eyes. I would also kick them out. Why do major favors for people who won\u2019t help you with a small one?  No one is an asshole in the situation. Obviously, they all have the right to act the way they did.

How do you even begin compare them?", "I mean, the tea cup doesn't move on its own, nor is it covered in shit.", "A few years ago I went to see a friend who had a school age child and a baby. When it was time to pick up her eldest it was raining heavily and as the school was just across the road from the school she left me with the baby and went to pick up the elder son. \n\nFrom the minute she walked out of the door the baby started screaming and me not having any childcare experience I had no idea what to do. He eventually stopped screaming as my friend came back in. It was probably less than 10 minutes but it felt a lot longer. \n\nIt took ten years before I trusted myself to be alone with a baby again and that was only with the birth of my son. If she wasn't comfortable she wasn't comfortable.", "Same, the idea of being left alone with a baby scares me rigid. If required I'd cook or clean, but I don't think it's right to ask a person to provide intimate personal care without making sure they're okay with it first.", "I agree.", "I think it\u2019s possible that there is no big omission.

If she hasn\u2019t and the babies dad isn\u2019t going to be there to teach her, she now needs to google it and teach herself how to do it and stumble through actually doing it all while people are outside waiting on her. \n\nNot to mention if she hadn't changed the baby's diaper before, she might have no idea where items are stored. Unless they've got it all laid out, she's going to have to search. Because inevitably, the wipes tub will be out or the diaper cream is low or its a blowout and baby needs another onesie. Any of those things will require the dad's attention if she has to ask where things are. \n\nI get E S H but I'm just hung up on baby's dad not having an arrangement for when he's in a meeting. Did he just assume his niece would be there? This is the one thing that kills me about WFH. If you're in a situation where you can't leave your desk, you can't care for a baby or young child at the same time. \n\nAlso, how did he even know a diaper change was needed? Did the baby shart loud enough to be heard on the monitor? I know some parents say they can tell the difference in cries (I don't have kids so can't confirm or deny) but what if kid was hungry? Gassy? Generally unhappy? If the baby wasn't crying and it was just time for a diaper change, I find it somewhat sus dude waits until she's about to leave to say something. He knew he had a meeting during that time, he could have said something. \n\nI will readily admit my own bias here because I've been in situations where people will purposefully inconvenience me as a power move of some kind.

It's the least we can do is help out occasionally. \n\nNow I don't think taking advantage of desperate people you're helping is appropriate, but asking someone at home a quick favor as they run out the door isn't muling or asking too much of anyone.

There's so many scenarios that could play out when it comes to changing children of this age because they do move a lot and they are kind of wiggly it's not like a newborn who just lays there. Unless previously stated and agreed upon that the 18 year old would be a part of the child care plan than OP's brother and his gf are definitely AH.  It actually seems quite neglectful for them to not have worked out child care during this meeting if it was so important it makes me question what type of parents they truly are.  And considering OP said this happened last Friday and you're giving them two weeks to get out which is a  week before Christmas, if they celebrate, that's really  extremely cruel. And also nobody seems to be taking into account that Op said that him and his wife just got divorced which is a huge transition for adult children. I was 24 of my parents had divorced it was traumatizing, so  maybe there needs to be a little more consideration for the 18 year old, and and the huge transition period she currently is in and now she has to have the burden to believe that she is the reason that her and her father may become homeless. She should be expected  to contributed around the house as she is old enough to do tasks such as cleaning or cooking etc, but I certainly would not feel comfortable with an 18-year-old changing my child's diaper if they were not comfortable doing.

At 9 months old children need more than just a diaper change, every now and then, they need to be stimulated they need to play and they need parental supervision. Also if I walked in and anybody was berating my child and they were crying I would not find that acceptable either the brother is blaming the 18-year-old daughter for him getting kicked out of the meeting when it simply comes back to him not properly planning.

The idea that working from home means anyone can work when is convenient for them and has all kind of flexibility to take care of kids or whatever is kind of predicated on the assumption that they doing project or data based work, that they don't have to work with anyone outside their organization to outside of prescheduled meetings, and that they are salaried.", "You can NOT work from home and be responsible for taking care of a child especially if you have a job which requires your ability to perform duties during specific hours. Many jobs require a statement of how you are handling childcare.\n\nThis is especially true since presumably the \"meeting\" was scheduled so the brother would have known that he would be unavailable for ANY child care during the meeting.\n\nThe circumstances of being kicked out of a meeting - who knows. From the company's point of view, having to change a diaper because you didn't get child care while working is not acceptable. The company assumes that people who are working from home are not also taking care of children. \n\nThis is completely different than if someone got a true emergency call that their child was in the hospital or very ill because then it is understandable why they need to take care of that emergency - changing a diaper is a completely foreseeable occurrence. And also during an 8 hour working day, the child would need to be fed; possibly comforted if crying. If the brother had NOT been at the meeting he would have been cheating the company in terms of time not spent working. For some jobs you aren't really on the clock so it doesn't matter so long as you get your job done, it doesn't matter when you do it but these are generally higher level salaried positions where you also are expected to work more than 9 to 5 when there is a time crunch.\n\nOn the other hand, if OP and his 18 year old daughter are staying for free, they should try to be as helpful as possible.

It is the parents' responsibility to ensure they have proper childcare in place while they are working and it doesn't sound like that was part of the agreement for the OP and daughter to move in.

There's no excuse for him not knowing this and arranging in advance. It is entirely predictable that an infant would need to be changed over the course of a call, and brother should have had a better plan. \n\nI totally agree that it would have been appropriate for niece to help and, if I were OP, I would have had a private conversation about how these are situations where, as guests, they should be willing to help out, and define what those boundaries are.

It would have been better to have listened to the account of what happened and said to the brother \"OK I'll handle this\" and taken the daughter into another room.  The brother would have felt he was heard and even thought the daughter would be punished whereas OP was free to do and say whatever they wanted with the daughter, punish or not punish.  \n\nIt would have been a perfect time to say to the daughter that it is perhaps wise when you are a guest in someone's home to help out when asked.  She is not obligated to provide child care h\u00f2wever when you are living off the generosity of someone else,  you should try to do things to help them in exchange.  I understand its her parents job to provide her with a home, food, and care. But she's not 10; she's old enough to understand they are living in someone else's home because of that person's  generosity.  If she had never changed a diaper and didn't know how, she should have told her uncle that,  not just give an excuse of \"I'm meeting friends\".  I think teens can be rather flippant in their responses even when that's not their intent. Meeting Friends sounds like she really doesn't care about him or his kid; she only cares about meeting her friends. In reality she may have never changed a diaper and didn't know how to but didn't say that to her uncle.  I can understand from the uncle's POV, he asked 1 small favor and given how generous he had been, when the niece wouldn't help out, he was angry.\n\nOP is upset that the brother told off the daughter but perhaps the uncle felt she is family and he had the right to reprimand her. I bet he was angry having to leave the meeting but probably frustrated to be in the position of WFH and having to care for a baby, an almost impossible feat.  No doubt that factored in his reprimand.  It might have been harsh but again, the niece is not 10; she's legally an adult.  OP tries to paint a picture of a young defenseless crying little girl who is being tormented by the mean, raging Uncle. Yeah he was pissed off, no doubt, but at 18 I think she's old enough to be told off about her behavior.  Whether we agree on that part doesn't really matter, the point is OP made it a big issue rather than just saying \"I'll handle it\". He decided to take on his brother over it which was a big mistake. He should have thought \"We're living it their home, let it go\". \nYTA OP, you made a little scrap into WWIII.", "This is what i was thinking as well.  OP says that her brother watches the 9 month old baby from a nanycam while he is working. Which I'm going to assume, the baby is locked in its bedroom to roam freely or in the crib/playpen for hours, while the dad works?  Probably works 8hrs, 2  15 minute breaks plus lunch. Seems like child neglect and probably happens all the time. Why don't the parents have a babysitter during these hours or asked the niece to watch he cousin while he was working or have a playpen/area for the baby to be in the same room as dad.", "Exactly this. At 18 my stepsister would often leave her baby with me and I had no fucking clue what to do with it. It scared me actually, I didn't like kids, poop made me feel like throwing up, ect ect. Maybe spending some time with daughter and baby to show her the basics, and maybe chill and have everyone talk out  helping each other out. 18 year old is not responsible for her father's situation either, is probably already pretty damn distabilised life wise, and being yelled at for something so minor? It's not helping anyone.", "I didn't have any much younger siblings so I was terrified of babies at 18. Not that they would hurt me, but that I would somehow drop them or otherwise hurt them accidentally. My solution was to never touch them", "The only reason I think ESH and not YTA is because, as some one else mentioned, if the daughter had left on time it would have been solely on him to figure that shit out. At the end of the day he sucks for not being prepared to care for his child when he was gunna be home alone, and she sucks for not taking 5 min to change the diaper, ESPECIALLY since they are guests. \n\nBut again what would he have just left the baby poop for the rest of the meeting? He's just as shitty.", "So, if you went to live with some family member (or friend) because you lost your place and they had 6 little dogs who growl and snip at you when you even try to pet them, it would be totally reasonable to expect you (or your child) to take them for walks if they are too busy, even if you (or your child) are uncomfortable with it\u2026 simply because they were kind enough to let you live with them?\u2026 I mean, for most people dogs like that are THEIR little babies and it\u2019s sooo cute when they get all growly and try to bite other people\u2026", "Thank you for introducing logic. He knew he had to work from home, he knew he had a meeting, he knew he had to take care of his child. He did not line up child care in case of an emergency, or ensure that the 18 year old was able to help out prior to joining the meeting. He is TA. Do I think Opie could help out with small one time things while living with her brother? Absolutely. His reaction to the Teen sounds indicative of his reaction to probably everything. If he blew up at her that big just imagine how he reacted in his meeting.

But I don't think OP is being an AH for defending their daughter so I'm going with NTA, the brother is the AH. This isn't asking if OP is the AH for the way tasks are divvied up, it's about telling the brother off for yelling at the 18 year old. \n\nWhat is OP supposed to do? Sit their daughter down and tell her she's a free babysitter now? They can have a discussion about helping out with the baby but if it wasn't discussed in advance and this 18 year old has never changed a diaper, nobody should be yelling at her.", "The one time I TRIED to, I puked. On the baby. Some of us just can\u2019t deal with that kind of biohazard horror \ud83d\ude39", "Oh I missed the part about them having been living there for 3 months. Assumed they had just recently moved in. How does the daughter not feel comfortable around babies when she\u2019s been living with one for 3 months??", "> or would have been more specific if she actually had a good reason for not being there helping her brother watch his small child while she flops for free at his house.\n\nI've had to be a long-term guest and in that situation, it's often polite to leave the house for hours on end so it's not like \"omg OP is ALWAYS HERE.\" Brother could've asked OP or Daughter if they could be available for childcare while he was at work, but he didn't. \n\nIt's highly possible that there's a whole host of issues due to no one talking or planning, but it's not OP's fault for not being inside the house, nor is it Daughter's fault for refusing when she had people waiting outside for her. Heck, if Daughter hadn't been running late, this wouldn't have even been a question.", "I agree. There\u2019s not a lot of information about WHY they\u2019re kicking them out. I doubt it has to do with the daughter not changing a diaper one time.", "9 months is not a fragile newborn. My second started walking at 9 months.", "The important details here are: take old diaper off, give them a few clean swipes, then put a new diaper on. Even if the daughter did the worst job on the planet, it's better than sitting in a full diaper. And would give the dad an extra half hour to \"fix\" any issues with the diaper afterwards.", "Omg. Yes! These people are acting like it takes a wealth of knowledge to change a diaper when all it really takes is some damn common sense. I changed plenty of diapers when I was 10. \n\nIf someone was allowing me to stay at their place for a bit while I got \"back on my feet\", I'd definitely be helping in whatever way I could to show my appreciation.", "> I bet this guy really is the AH and he is holding back the smoking gun.\n\nYou said \"this guy\" when op and her daughter are women so they assumed you were saying it's likely the brother is the AH. \n\n>:)", "It could only be for the duration of the work meeting. It\u2019s so rare for a meeting to last all day but quite common for half hour/hour long meetings scheduled at a specific time of day. Most of the time a nine month old baby is just sleeping, so setting up a monitor is fine.", "When I had my boat, they were the biggest menace I had to face other than weather.", "If you're starring for the meeting, shouldn't you make childcare arrangements? The daughter was supposed to have already been gone at the time of the request, so he would have been in the same position regardless.\n\nYes, changing the diaper would have been the best course to not make waves. But it's not a reasonable request for someone not comfortable handling the baby who is also on a time crunch. Babies will pee on people while being changed, blowouts can be entire ordeals to clean. If either of those happened, the daughter would have been forced to spend even more time after changing the baby in order to change clothes or clean herself up.\n\nIt doesn't sound like OP had a chance to diffuse the situation. She walked into her brother berating her crying daughter over an honestly minor issue that happened hours before. And the brother was evidently in enough of a lather that instead of allowing OP to handle that discussion, he escalated it until his girlfriend kicked OP and her daughter out.", "Similarly, he may not have been invited to the meeting (i.e. on the actual meeting invite) and most have waiting rooms to see if anyone in the meeting recognizes them.  If he was presenting, and whoever let him in took over presenting, they won't see the waiting room because they are presenting.  Or, tons of meetings I go to have everyone routed to a waiting room, but it only really gets checked near the beginning of a meeting.  Lot's of technical reasons to not get back in once you leave.", "I'm wondering if work doesn't know he's at home as the sole caretaker of an infant while he's working from home and he didn't want to have to explain why he had to step away for 5 minutes.", "It\u2019s not the best idea to have someone who\u2019s clueless change the baby. I don\u2019t think he thought it through. It certainly wasn\u2019t okay for him to berate her over it.", "It's literally just wiping an ass. It's concerning that there are a lot of people here who apparently don't know how to do that.", "What makes you think OP is a woman? I was picturing OP as the 18yo's dad.", "Wild levels of entitlement give people this notion that they can be incredibly selfish. Astounding that people would gild such a ridiculous take of \"abuse\" for letting a child nap in the crib.", "This sub is beyond ridiculous. It really is. I've been coming here less and less. The comment sections are fucking wild", "Right? The fuck is wrong with this sub haha. Acting like changing the diaper is like solving the damn Lament Configuration, putting a resting baby in a crib to watch with a cam while you work to pay for the house your grown ass relatives live in is abuse haha.", "Would they listen?  They're dhingbats after all...", "Getting \"kicked out after 5 minutes\" sounds more like it was a gaming session than a WfH meeting", "That\u2019s the expectation for the company I work for. We\u2019re still required to be on the phone during the times that we\u2019re scheduled. We have single parents still sending their young kids to daycare because of that.", "On the flip-side, there comes a point where you can be taking advantage of somebody's kindness if you aren't pitching in to help out the household you've been taken into. Eventually you can wear out your welcome, and your hosts can ask you to leave. It doesn't sound OP and her daughter were kicked out immediately for not changing the diaper, it sounds like OP and daughter continued to double down on why they were in the right, which soured the relationship.    \n    \nPerhaps the initial request was more of a demand, but even if so, it was pretty trivial. OP and her daughter decided it was a hill worth dying on.   \n   \nAlso, my judgment is NAH. The disagreement itself is pretty reasonable, even if the consequences were severe.", "If I'm holding a friend's baby, I hand it back if I have the slightest suspicion that it might need to be changed. If this dude had asked me to change the diaper he'd likely tell me nevermind as I'd be shouting asking for instructions the whole time and making exasperated noises. I'm twice this girl's age. \n\nEven if he and his girlfriend were upset about this one instance, they could have sat her down, asked her why she didn't, let her know that occasionally they might need help with the baby and ask if she'd be okay learning a few ways to help them out. People respond much better when you treat them with respect than if you just lay into them for not doing what you want without offering any understanding.\n\nThat last bit isn't directed at you, just generally at all these people getting upset at a kid not knowing how to change a diaper like it's ingrained in our genetic code or something.", "Not to mention you already reverse-engineered putting a diaper on when you took the dirty one off.", "Cannot believe people are gilding comments calling it \"abuse\" to let a child nap in the crib. Beyond ridiculous takes.", "So many self centered comments these days...", "I think we all know that people that work remote with children normally have a contingency plan in those cases but generally just hold the fort themselves. \n\n\nTo me that's another conversation for different time. At this time, he had someone who could have done him a solid for five minutes, they chose not to which is their decision. And now it's the bro and gf decision to kick them out for being unhelpful.", "Since baby is only 9months old, the uncle is likely feeling the strain of WFH while caring for an infant and still figuring it all out and got caught in a tight spot.", "The ghost of Kirsty MaCcoll coughs discreetly", "So companies denies employees visits to the toilet ?", "My thought process is if the same or more work gets done WFH than in the office, then they have no right to micromanage. \n\nI know people who when they work in the office get 1/2 the work done they get done at home, and when they are wfh, they get more work done, less errors, quicker and are able to attend to personal matters. And it amounts to lack of colleagues and manager interuptions in person. \n\nOne of the managers used to sit right behind them and ask them what they were doing, or if they could switch projects and do something else the manager deemed more important in that moment, every 5 minutes, and then ask them when they were getting their original work done. Would yell at them for taking a 2 minute personal call, but not care if the colleagues around them were talking Marvel for 30 minutes and not getting any work done.\n\nSo, I have little respect for micro managers inside or outside the office. The reason they micromanage is because they feel so insignificant and lack control in most other areas of their life.", "Exactly:\n\n1) Brother and his GF should have had a plan for childcare during working hours. Likely, they are trying to save money - but watching a nine month old and WFH are not compatible.\n\n2) Niece should have done a one off favor and had a conversation afterwards.\n\nESH", "I am still baby phobic and know having a baby is not for me. People for some reason see baby friendly on my face and I barely like to hold one. They try to shove it in my face and think I will be happy to hold them or change their diaper. It gets annoying but I set my boundaries and refuse. It\u2019s just rude that people try to push their baby on me. They need to respect that everyone is not going to be in awe of their baby", "If you empty your baby on a regular schedule you will never be caught by surprise *taps temple*", "Likely B & SIL assumed niece could/would just change a diaper as needed...\n\nAnd never once asked when it was happening in the moment when they both were there and suggest this as a means of helping niece on case the need arose.\n\nThen niece could have had an opportunity to discuss her discomfort...\n\nNew parents are so often in emergency mode, all hands on deck! \n\nThey forgot when they didn't have a baby and were grossed out by the bodily stuff, afraid of hurting or dropping the baby and certain to be harangued if she got it minuetly wrong. \n\nESH sounds like 1 over agreement- yes Bro & niece can stay, but no discussion about how to participate in the household. Unexplained expectations are mine fields.", "Yeah I have no idea of how to change a diaper and would literally not be able to do it in a scenario like this"]}
