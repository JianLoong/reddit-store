Your brother shouldn't get to decide her priorities.\n\nI get their frustration though and to them it was a small ask. You might ask your brother what he plans to do when this happens again in the future? What has he done in the past? Surely it wasn't the first time the baby needed changing at an inopportune time. What would he have done if your daughter had already left? It might get him rethinking making you leave. If you do stay, I would make it clear that you'll help when you're home, but your daughter isn't comfortable around babies and you don't want to force it. \n\nINFO: If you were in your brother's situation (your infant child and your daughter wouldn't change the diaper bc she was late for a party, causing you to miss out on a critical work event or let's say a chance at a promotion!), would you have tried to make your 18yo do it and been majorly pissed when she didn't? Or would you have accepted it and respected her choice?", "If you and your daughter have been staying with your brother for three months, both of you should have been helping out with the baby.

I imagine you're doing so at a reduced cost.  Because of this, the proper thing to do is help out with small things like changing a diaper from time to time.  Honestly, I don't care that your daughter is uncomfortable with babies.  In life, sometimes you have to deal with shit that's uncomfortable and no one is around to hold your hand.  It's your job as a parent to teach your child how to deal with those kinds of situations.  If she didn't know how to change a diaper, that's one thing and excusable.  But if she has done it and knows how, it wouldn't have killed her.  \n\nYou didn't need to go off and yell at your brother either.

Your daughter didn't *have* to help with the diaper in any legal sense, but in a \"just being a good person\" sense. No where in your post did you mention 1) paying rent, 2) going out of your way to do other things around the house, 3) anything previously agreed as off-limits.  \n\nA  diaper change is a 5 second, minimal task, and it sounds like your daughter\u2014who has not previously expressed an aversion to being around babies\u2014was making up an excuse so she could get to a party. At the very least, she hasn't been so uncomfortable around babies to make living in a house with her baby cousin a hardship before now.  \n\nI hope you read some of the comments in here and use them to form an apology to your brother and his girlfriend (preferably from both you and your daughter). Unlike some of the more callous assholes here, I don't want to see you thrown out on your ass for having a simple disagreement among family members. You were in the wrong, but that doesn't need to be the end of the story.

I did not grow up with babies in my life, I certainly had never been taught how to change one, I was highly anxious about ever hurting or dropping them or making them cry, and so I was always profoundly uncomfortable when people tried to hand me a baby with the expectation I would want to hold it and 'naturally' knew how to do so.\n\nWhat would your brother have done if your daughter had already left? What happens if his baby has a more urgent need when he's alone in the house and in a work meeting?

If your daughter is that unwilling to support and help the people who are housing her for free, she (and you) will have to find a place you actually pay for.", "Iunno, man, if someone was housing me during a difficult time, I might suck it up and do the small, 2 minute favor. You and your daughter sound pretty ungrateful. \n\nYeah, it's their baby, but now you have to find somewhere else to live. I don't really blame them, either. It doesn't sound like their along much in return for y'all living there. \n\nI guess YTA, though I'm tempted to go everyone is shitty because this is such a petty hill for everyone to die on.", "Yta. You are correct, his baby is his responsibility just as your young adult daughter is both her own and your responsibility yet your brother is supporting you both by letting you live there. So a ten second favor just made you homeless, talk about biting the hand that feeds you", ">I told my brother off and said that his daughter is his and his girlfriend's respondibility and he shouldn't rely on my daughter for her care\n\nYet, you and your adult daughter are relying on him for a safe place to live. You and your adult daughter are not his responsibility but he has taken you in in your time of need. YTA", "YTA you caused this yourself. You were living rent free. It's not as though you were being asked to provide all child care. Your adult daughter was asked to do a small thing to help out so the person paying the rent could do his work. You and your daughter suck for not recognizing that it costs something to live somewhere - sometimes money, sometimeshelpi g out the person that pays the rent. If she didn't like it she should go to her father's. If you don't like it the. You should have found and paid for your own place prior.", "what the fuck is wrong with so many people that you don't make small favours to anyone, let alone family? you're living in their house! he only asks for one diaper change, that she could do it, it wouldn't make her terrible late for her dinner. it could made a difference in his job, and it did! and i don't like babies either, doesn't mean my hands get rotten if i touch a kid. i don't get y'all. i can help a stranger on the street if it doesn't affect my life negatively, how could i say no to the person that is givin me a bed and shelter? lol ffs", "100%. I see this come up a lot on Reddit, where someone will move in with someone, and then refuse to do small things to help the person housing them. The person housing them throws them out, and they're SHOCKED because they have nowhere else to go.\n\nIf someone has turned their lives upside-down to house OP and their daughter, OP and their daughter should be doing EVERYTHING they can to show their appreciation.", "True but it\u2019s probably best they move for the sake of the relationships. The funny thing about these small one time favors is they never truly stay one time.", "I work from home in a technical field, and have done so for years. Most places have rules in place about childcare during work hours, especially for babies/toddlers. If OP's brother is, on a regular basis, simultaneously parenting a 9-month-old during working hours then he is 100% the AH here.\nHowever, I think OP has overstayed his welcome. He's had three months to figure out his living arrangements.", "Yeah, I'm wondering wtf is going on with this couple that they leave their 9 month old baby alone while they're working. Do they have no plan for childcare??\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH -- everyone except that poor baby who seems to be an afterthought for all the adults in this household. And yes, the 18 year old is an adult too and more than capable of thinking of others before herself. \n\nI work from home and have a 15 month old. I usually have care arranged. At times I've had to change/nurse the baby during a call. Just turn off the camera, mute, and take care of it.", "What would he have done if she had already left?", "You forgot to add that the refusal of this favor impacted his job which is apparently supporting ALL of them. I despise babies and never changed a diaper in my life, but if I was living with someone because I had no where to go I'd do it. She's 18, not 10. Old enough to find her own housing is she can't help out for 5 minutes.", "I see it as ESH because it\u2019s all being done in such a reactionary way. Brother needs a better childcare arrangement for his 9mo child than watching her on a monitor while he works from home, and then hoping he can draft his niece to help without any warning or agreement. But OP and their daughter are living there by his grace, and digging in with some kind of \u201cno right to expect help\u201d isn\u2019t an appropriate approach either. It\u2019s reasonable for the brother to expect help, if he were to make expectations clear ahead of time. But he needs to prepare better, especially since OP\u2019s daughter had almost gone out already.", "I think it\u2019s possible to guess their level of involvement in the house if the daughter hasn\u2019t changed a single diaper in months of living rent free (which I\u2019m assuming since there\u2019s no mention of being tenants with the standard 30 days). There\u2019s no obligation to help with the baby, but there is courtesy to the folks housing you, especially when they\u2019re dealing with a baby. I would bet that not lifting a finger to help with a 6-9mo old gets old fast and this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nYTA OP", "I had to scroll way too far down to find this. \n\nIt's not the 18 year old's responsibility, but Jesus, they're staying for free. What happened to people just treating each other nicely and family helping each other out? Like is it that hard to do someone a small favor or extend some grace?", "Probably nothing", "THIS! Housing is expensive and requires maintenance -cleaning, repairs, etc. If the OP isn't paying rent or utilities, they aren't providing care for their own child, the brother is. To ask for a return of the favor, care for his own child for 5 minutes (all the teens 'waiting outside' have phones and can either give her tips or just chill on their phone before the party - not going to take SATs, not catching a plane, a party!) is not a big deal. She just didn't want to get her hands dirty.", "What baffles me is the way people are treating them as two different family units.. That kid in diapers is the OPs niece as well and the 18yo is her elder cousin.\n\nObviously this situation requires more context of previous interactions/arrangements but if you are sharing the same roof with a family for 3 months you better step up/chip in.", "I also wonder if brother would have asked the 18YO to change the diaper if OP happened to have a son as opposed to a daughter. A lot of men immediately defer to women for child care even when they are the father and the woman present isn\u2019t responsible for the child.", "My thoughts exactly. If he can't step away for 5min. Than there should have been a full time supervisor at home. Not an 18yo in a rush with presumebly no experience. Sounds like bad communication. Good that you stood up for your daughter. But there is something missing from the story. Please fill the gaps", "I share your concerns.  I WFH and my MIL watches my 5m old. When the baby was a newborn WFH without help was easier because the baby sleeps most the day. Now that the baby is older and stays up longer, interaction and constant supervision is required.  I wonder how this nanny-cam approach to caring for the baby will hinder her development?", "Thank you. I was amazed at how many people are justifying this in the comments. \n\nWhat dis the brother have for childcare before OP and OP\u2019s daughter moved in? \n\nWhy did he assume OP\u2019s daughter would be comfortable with changing a diaper without communicating with her beforehand?", "I'm honestly kind of concerned here about the number of people here who seen to think the daughter not doing this one thing (whether it was justified or not) is a genuinely a good enough reason to just kick out loved ones that need a place to stay. Like, if you're staying in someone's house, you should be grateful and help out when you can\n.... But do people really think this means if you can't/don't one time you deserve to be kicked out and homeless? If someone was staying with me and mostly doing the right thing and couldn't help out one time like that, I wouldn't think of berating or kicking them out. The number of people on here who think that's a reasonable response to someone staying with you as soon as you can't help them out genuinely concerns me.", "Yup.  When I lived with a couple of friends we all had no problem helping each other out when there was a need for it - and that was a situation where we were splitting rent and bills evenly.  It's an arrangement that lasted for a decade with no issues.", "Give me a break!  It's changing a diaper, not rocket science.  Take the dirty one off, wipe their butt and clean them up,  put a clean diaper on, throw the dirty diaper in the garbage, go wash up.", "You know how I learned how to change a diaper? A 30 second wiki and common sense. It isn\u2019t rocket science, I\u2019m not sure why people are acting like it is.", "Do you want to be right? Or do you want a place to live?", "My dad said this to me all growing up! I still think about it now when I\u2019m having dumb arguments with my family.", "\u2665\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "This ^^^^ that\u2019s a wise grandma right there.", "I always say I'd rather be wrong & kind than right & an asshole", "And i would have told him we are not family and i'm not your brother anymore", "YUP.  It honestly is a case of beggars can't be choosers.  I 100% agree that it shouldn't be on niece to change the diaper. But like - they just lost free housing?", "What would he have done had she already left?  What did he do before they moved in?\n\nHe needs to get childcare. OP and daughter are NTA.", "[deleted]", "Also daughter was going out. Who was going to watch the baby once she left? NTA but it\u2019s not going to help you with your brother.", "I was thinking the same thing! Like if this whole situation happened literally just five minutes later, it sounds like the daughter would have been gone (considering her friends were already outside waiting for her) so what then? What was the brother's contingency plan for childcare while he was alone in the house? Based on the post, he would have been kicked out of his meeting regardless.  \n\nIf the brother works in a position that is so rigid he cannot step away from the computer, he and his partner absolutely should have found a more sustainable alternate child care arrangement. If this was a super special one-off extra important meeting (thus why the brother couldn't step away and got booted from it for needing a personal moment), then he should have conveyed to OP and their daughter in advance that he really needs some assistance from 1-3pm (or whenever) because of an important meeting and then schedules could have been arranged. But shouting at the daughter as she was actively leaving the house for pre-arranged plans, with people waiting to pick her up outside, while she was likely dressed up for the party, and what sounds like no prior knowledge of how to change a diaper, seems like a pretty cruel thing to make two family members homeless over.", "Thank you, I was so surprised that no one else had pointed out that it seems that this poor baby was supposed to be just alone in her crib or play area while her dad was wfh. I am not giving judgment but I'm feeling sorry for the baby.", "I\u2019m wondering if her teen was his childcare plan and she\u2019s simply over it at this point? They sound awful making a kid cry over their baby and then kicking out family going thru a divorce? Toxic so maybe they\u2019re doing her a favor. I hope she and daughter find a better situation.", "This is what\u2019s important here. This is not a newborn that has the potential to sleep for a significant portion of the day, outside of feeds and changes; this is a 9 month old baby - that is absolutely not a situation you can mix with working from home. A nine month old needs interaction as well as near constant monitoring as they\u2019re more than likely mobile.\n\nIt seems that either brother and girlfriend have childcare that wasn\u2019t available that day, the child is left to entertain herself for a significant amount of time during the work days when the girlfriend has shifts (in a playpen/in the room with brother or whatever, one would hope at the very least) or brother isn\u2019t giving anywhere near as much time to his job as he should be when this happens.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say either way whether OP is paying rent to the brother, but it doesn\u2019t seem that any childcare was part of the deal for them living there.   I guess it would have been nice of the daughter to try to change the baby before she left, but I\u2019m not sure I even would have wanted a teen relative with no experience at all of caring for a child to change my baby tbh. As others have said, what would he have done if she\u2019d already left? What has he done other times that he\u2019s been working and caring for his daughter at the same time?\n\nIf this was literally a one-off, there\u2019s normally childcare in place or brother\u2019s working days never normally coincide with gf\u2019s shifts, etc then it\u2019s a different question. I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s daughter was necessarily in the wrong but can see how it could be seen that way; I think brother and girlfriend have definitely overreacted based on the information given.", "People like OPs brother ruin work from home for everyone. They are the reason the option gets taken away and bosses want people in the office.\n\nYou can\u2019t be responsible for children (especially an infant) AND still be working. He was putting in a half assed work day and couldn\u2019t do the childcare duties either.", "He is probably supposed to have actual childcare while working. The parents are TA because they have a stupid situation set up that is ridiculous. Someone needs to take care of the child. A 9 month old is crawling, starting to stand up, needs interaction, etc. You can't just watch them with a camera all day.", "Right it makes me feel weird seeing people saying the brother isn\u2019t the A hole, like the niece should just do it because she\u2019s a woman and it comes \u201cnatural\u201d to them.", "I never changed a nappy (diaper) until I had my 1st at 33 years old.

So NTA and brother needs to sort out his life and figure out child care.", "What arrangements could they be doing? You want that on paper, supervised by a lawyer and signed with blood? I think the situation is a bit different when the one you're asking the favor to is a member of your family, specially if said member is crashing at your house rent free. Parents do everything for their kids without not taking care of the other aspects of their own personal/professional lives. If he opted for a nanny cam, I think it's safe to assume that it was on an adequate moment for the baby. And don't worry, they already got rightfully kicked out.", "An AH wouldn\u2019t provide literal housing and shelter for someone\u2026 their house, that\u2019s all that matters.

The only person being infantilized here is the dad who somehow was incapable of figuring out beforehand that his baby might need his attention while he's in a meeting and people are like \"yeah, that's normal dad behaviour\". The 18-yo girl is being expected to be comfortable around babies and okay with changing a diaper (the figuring out how to do it part is actually rather irrelevant, cause obv she could find that out), which quite frankly is sexist as fuck (newsflash, not all women like babies or are okay handling them).\n\nAlso, this is so far from a clear cut case of infantilizing women that I don't think you even know what that fenomenon is about.", "This is often how assholes kind of win.

The same as an in person meeting if you need to nip out you silence your mic (either tell them or add a comment) and nip to the bathroom. Could have done that easily and changed the baby quickly.

If he is regularly interrupting meetings or otherwise being distracted from work stuff to do childcare, this may not be the first time he has been spoken to about it.\n\nLikewise, if he wants his niece to do childcare  for him, he should have made arrangements for that with her, whether as a favour or paid.

I've never changed a diaper before. If they wanted my help, then they'd have to show me and do it with me a few times before I flew solo.

I also babysat from like 12-14 and then stopped once school and sports and clubs picked up and made it very hard to be a reliable option. Nobody was hiring a 13 year old to watch an infant alone because the people I babysat for were extremely reasonable people so I basically babysat kids <10yrs with older toddler age being the general minimum cutoff.\n\nIn my 30s and can't remember ever changing a diaper. Maybe I helped hold something in place for someone once? Can't even remember.", "Same I'm 36 and never have, closest is having to take recently toilet trained toddlers to the loo.\n\nThat said in a pinch I'm fairly sure I could figure out how to change a nappy even if it wasn't the most competent job.", "Same never changed a nappy.

My husband has been doing a job he absolutely adores since about September. We live in a small community where living wages are impossible to find so he worked his ass off to find something remote and that he could commit to (he was also changing careers, it was a stressful time looking for that work). \n\nANYWAY. We were both very, very paranoid about the office expectations. Got into a couple fights because I take care of the three daughters and he doesn't have a separate office, it's our bedroom. He wanted to put a lock on from the inside and I was like - uh no, you're not going to lock me out of my own bedroom. And I do have two teenagers and I have a very small step daughter. So my husband is my helpmate, and I just have to get the timing right. Neither of us, have *ever* expected the older kids to do anything primary for the 5-yr-old. We *always* ask, and if they say no, that's their freedom and we move onto the next plan. (I think this comes from childhood. Where I had a younger brother who is only fifteen months younger than me. But I ran the household. I mean cooking, cleaning, making sure he's safe. Being the latchkey kid fucking sucked). \n\nMy god do I tell long winded stories. ALL OF THAT TO SAY - about maybe two weeks into my husband's training, they were in a meeting. And he gets up to go to the bathroom. And he starts hacking away at some phlegm. He sort of does that really loud nasal clear too. And then blew his nose (it's as a loud as a trumpet). He didn't have video on, but one of his coworkers in his ear goes: hey, not to interrupt your performance or anything, which was great, but would you mind muting yourself? \n\nGod I'm crying laughing just retelling this. I think my point is, most of us want to be team players. If you get punitive marks for needing to change a diaper... maybe it's time to find somewhere a little more adaptable \ud83d\ude33", "Not impossible, but his other reactions here don't fill me with confidence that this isn't his character paying dividends.", "Especially considering, the daughter wasn't supposed to be there when he asked. Which means he didn't have a plan or childcare established", "Probably because he's not supposed to be the sole care provider of an infant while at work. I know during the initial lock down it was a bit of free for all but now that many companies have moved more permanently to work from home they are making policies that basically say just like you can't bring your baby in to the office, you can't be taking care of your infant during work hours, especially during meetings.", "As an FYI, for some companies WFH still means that you should be working. Not running errands, not doing chores, not taking care of kids. Working. A friend of mine and a cousin both got fired for taking 'company time' to attend to 'personal needs'. I think people were slightly more lax when there were lots of active infections with COVID, companies have conceded WFH as a point, but many want their employees to put in the required time. Besides, he was in a meeting.

It\u2019s not about what the favor was, it\u2019s the fact the girl can\u2019t be bothered to help her uncle who is quite literally going out on a limb to help her and her mom. The fact they can\u2019t even help with a small thing would speak volumes in my eyes. I would also kick them out. Why do major favors for people who won\u2019t help you with a small one?  No one is an asshole in the situation. Obviously, they all have the right to act the way they did. I see it as the consequences to OPs and OPs kids actions in play. \n\nNah technically but I\u2019m not a fan of the way OP and her daughter handled the situation. Definitely not cool.", "Because work is more important than hanging out?", "Are 12 years old? What kind of nonsense did you just spout?", "I think most likely they didn\u2019t know he had his daughter with him..", "Are you comparing a work meeting with a friends gathering? Hmmm, maybe things in other countries are weirdly different...", "Or even just call a bio break? Sometimes people need to leave a meeting, even in person, rather abruptly, and adults being adults can cope with a five minute break. What would brother have done if no one else was in the house?", "Why can\u2019t someone who is getting free housing instead of being homeless take five minutes to be helpful?", "Also, what would he have done if she wasn't there? I don't believe he got kicked out of a meeting for changing a diaper, something else had to have happened.", "They probably could, he just never asked. If the company offers enough flexibility that you can work from home, people there probably won't mind if you gotta leave for a few minutes to change a diaper.", "How did your wife learn?", "And this guy could have worn a bluetooth headset, muted himself and turned off his camera, and gone and changed the diaper. Nobody would have been the wiser.", "Pray you never find yourself in a desperate situation", "I can\u2019t imagine telling my sister to leave and only giving her two weeks to find a place. Fucking brutal. But you do you, baby boy.", "Is the rent OP is paying not reciprocation?", "They're completely different things. How do you even begin compare them?", "I mean, the tea cup doesn't move on its own, nor is it covered in shit.", "A few years ago I went to see a friend who had a school age child and a baby. When it was time to pick up her eldest it was raining heavily and as the school was just across the road from the school she left me with the baby and went to pick up the elder son. \n\nFrom the minute she walked out of the door the baby started screaming and me not having any childcare experience I had no idea what to do. He eventually stopped screaming as my friend came back in. It was probably less than 10 minutes but it felt a lot longer. \n\nIt took ten years before I trusted myself to be alone with a baby again and that was only with the birth of my son. If she wasn't comfortable she wasn't comfortable.", "Same, the idea of being left alone with a baby scares me rigid. If required I'd cook or clean, but I don't think it's right to ask a person to provide intimate personal care without making sure they're okay with it first.", "I agree.", "I think it\u2019s possible that there is no big omission. SIL may be tired of this arrangement \u2014 I would be \u2014 and needed a reason to pull the trigger.", ">Additionally, we don\u2019t even know if she has changed a diaper before. If she hasn\u2019t and the babies dad isn\u2019t going to be there to teach her, she now needs to google it and teach herself how to do it and stumble through actually doing it all while people are outside waiting on her. \n\nNot to mention if she hadn't changed the baby's diaper before, she might have no idea where items are stored. Unless they've got it all laid out, she's going to have to search. Because inevitably, the wipes tub will be out or the diaper cream is low or its a blowout and baby needs another onesie. Any of those things will require the dad's attention if she has to ask where things are. \n\nI get E S H but I'm just hung up on baby's dad not having an arrangement for when he's in a meeting. Did he just assume his niece would be there? This is the one thing that kills me about WFH. If you're in a situation where you can't leave your desk, you can't care for a baby or young child at the same time. \n\nAlso, how did he even know a diaper change was needed? Did the baby shart loud enough to be heard on the monitor? I know some parents say they can tell the difference in cries (I don't have kids so can't confirm or deny) but what if kid was hungry? Gassy? Generally unhappy? If the baby wasn't crying and it was just time for a diaper change, I find it somewhat sus dude waits until she's about to leave to say something. He knew he had a meeting during that time, he could have said something. \n\nI will readily admit my own bias here because I've been in situations where people will purposefully inconvenience me as a power move of some kind. Like, no one needs anything until I'm heading out the door or busy for fifteen minutes and *then* I'm in high demand. Repeatedly.", "Right? What would I do instinctually?

With that said I can't really fault the 18 year old for not doing it. I just think her excuse of not knowing how is just that an excuse. But yeah newborns are a whole different game. I do not blame or fault anyone for not wanting to change someone else's newborn due to the fragility. \n\nPersonally I think the biggest issue here is the Brother. He set up a situation where he left his 9 month old on Nanny Cam so he could work. That right there is neglect. No way that baby is getting all the stimulus needed. On top of that the 18 year old was already supposed to have left. So if she wasn't late he would have still been in the same situation.", "Changing diapers has nothing to do with being an adult. Being an adult has to do with setting your own boundaries, and this was a very reasonable one. Some people do not like babies. I don\u2019t mean people who wish harm on them, that\u2019s just ridiculous. I\u2019m taking some people find babies annoying, stressful, and uninteresting and find wiping someone else\u2019s ass gross. That is 100% reasonable, not everyone feels the sane about babies and kids and not everyone has to love them. While a diaper might not seem like a big deal to you, to me it would be a huge deal and would really bother me.", "You know there is a 3 steps instruction on each and every diaper box? I mean even by looking at a diaper you can tell how it's done. Its not like she was told to find a mathematical formula to calculate the hair strings of the baby", "Yes, but I just know a lot of companies, even if you are in person, if you step out of a meeting for a few minutes, it\u2019s not a good look. Happened at my old job to people. Not saying he should just dump the baby on his niece, he should have gotten someone to watch it while he works. But people saying just leave the meeting for a few isn\u2019t really doable for a lot of people. Especially if it was with higher ups or if he was running it.", "Agreed. He should have checked on the baby and changed the diaper before the meeting. \n\nMy comment was only concerning the fact that companies are cracking down on taking care of personal needs while employees are supposed to be working. The uncle and his gf need to re-evaluate their childcare plan if his work requires his full attention.\n\nUnfortunately, OP and his daughter are relying on the kindness of others to have a place to stay. Had I been in the daughter's position at that moment, I might have gone ahead and made a feeble attempt at changing the diaper and had a conversation with my parent after the fact and let them handle the situation with my uncle---especially knowing that we were relying on him. As it stands right now, the 18 year old and OP are out of a place to live...in the middle of very sparse inventory with regard to housing.\n\nAll that to say, sometimes you can be right but get the wrong results.", "I wondered this as well, if he can't actively care for their baby while working at home, he needs to make other arrangements.", "You can\u2019t claim neglect without knowing more details. 9 months old do not need as much stimulus as you\u2019re implying. His meeting could have been an hour long and he just wanted his child to have a fresh diaper. The fact he was so concerned about her diaper that he risked getting kicked out of his meeting shows he is not a neglectful parent.", "I do wish OP and daughter all the best finding new housing, but they are almost certainly better off without this uncle and his bad temper. If his extremely poor planning was an excuse to yell at his niece until she cried, he's probably been using her as his punching bag for weeks or months."]}
