That\u2019s way beyond a hormonal issue. Has she always been like that? Sounds completely bonkers. \nBut more importantly, who goes and spends $2000 on a cot they don\u2019t even like just because their twisted mind thinks they can\u2019t have the same cot as a family member - and then goes to attack that family member while they\u2019re doing them a favour? Someone needs to set her straight soon.\n\nETA You felt attacked because you *were* attacked. Over a non-issue. By your sister. While helping her out.

It shouldn't be a shock or a surprise sisters have similar tastes and order the same furniture item from the only reasonably priced store in the area.\n\nI wouldn't go the baby shower if she's just doing to turn your pregnancies into a competition.

It even holds true with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton where it's not about having something other rich people don't have, on the contrary its about rich people having all the same things so you find validation in your choices through that, while still getting a sense of identity through the fact that non rich people can't have them. \n\nStill NTA tho.

Your sister is about to become a mother and needs to learn how to control herself. Throwing a fit about something so arbitrary is ridiculous. \n\nDon't you apologise. You've done literally nothing wrong and it doesn't warrant it. She, however, *should* apologise. She's about to bring her child into the world and has more important things, by miles, to worry about you having the same cot when very few people are going to *see* the bloody things. It's highly likely no one would even notice because let's face who, other than your sister, gives a toss about a cot so long as baby has somewhere to sleep?\n\nETA: don't feel bad about the 2k she willingly spent on *another* cot.

She only has two months to celebrate the \"I have the only grandchild\" before the next one arrives. She has to share the spotlight,  so it's a complete disaster that they may have the same cot.", "You're not alone, as I was reading this I was like wtf is a cot? \ud83d\ude06 I've only ever known it as a camping bed (American here).", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
