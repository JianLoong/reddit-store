In a message she asked if I been looking at anymore baby stuff, and I said yes I had been looking at cots and sent a screenshot of the one I thought I wanted. She replied with oh the one I wanted? And I replied oh is it? I honestly hadn\u2019t remembered. She said yes but all good. So I left it at that and then ordered the cot a couple of weeks later. There was no more communication about the cot, and I thought everything was fine. I was wrong. \n\nA couple of weeks ago I was running errands organising things for her baby shower which is next month. She called and asked if I could come and pick her up to go shopping. I said yes and made the half an hour each way journey to go and pick her up and bring her back into town to go shopping. On the way in she said she had sent her cot back and got a new one and said she had spent $2000 on her new cot. When I replied that it was a lot of money she said she didn\u2019t really have a choice because I brought the cot that she had wanted and yelled and screamed at me the I\u2019m a mean unapproachable bitch over and over when I said she had opportunity to bring this up before I brought it. I ended up leaving her at the shopping centre, she got her boyfriend to pick her up. I left very upset (pregnancy hormones do not help).

That\u2019s way beyond a hormonal issue. Has she always been like that? Sounds completely bonkers. \nBut more importantly, who goes and spends $2000 on a cot they don\u2019t even like just because their twisted mind thinks they can\u2019t have the same cot as a family member - and then goes to attack that family member while they\u2019re doing them a favour? Someone needs to set her straight soon.\n\nETA You felt attacked because you *were* attacked. Over a non-issue. By your sister. While helping her out. This is *her fault* alone, all the way from being annoyed with it and not bringing it up all the way to going ballistic over it because she threw away her money to feel unique in her cot ownership.", "NTA, it's just a cot. The baby will only be in it for a short time.", "This was a one of a kind cot, right? That\u2019s the only way this makes sense.", "nta. none of this makes sense. you don\u2019t even live together and even if you did, none of this makes sense. at the same time, pregnant women are actually insane. but don\u2019t let her get away from apologizing for that tantrum. \n\nmy guess is she\u2019s taking some feelings out on you, hopefully she realizes that asap.", "NTA\u2026 again unless there\u2019s only 1 in existence it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just a cot, stays in each of ur respective homes, you are not showcasing it to the world.", "NTA. Why would it matter if you bought the same cot? I don\u2019t understand the problem.", "I have to assume she\u2019s mad about some other underlying stuff because this sounds insane. Of course hormones don\u2019t help like you said. Wonder how\u2019s your guys relationship is in general. \n\nAlso, when you say brought you mean bought, right", "NTA\n\nWhat the f--- It's a freaking COT. Who cares you have the same as your sister, cousin, next door neighbor? It's for a baby to sleep in!!! Does the cot is safe and comfy? That's all that matters!!!", "NTA. Let's hope it's your sister's pregnancy hormones that are making her act ridiculous.", "Why does it matter if you two have the same cot? You don't live in the same house. Also there are limited options for reasonably priced but good quality furniture. I imagine less so for childcare items. This is the equivalent of me and my sister are both looking for a bookshelf, and end up ordering the same book shelf from IKEA. It shouldn't be a shock or a surprise sisters have similar tastes and order the same furniture item from the only reasonably priced store in the area.\n\nI wouldn't go the baby shower if she's just doing to turn your pregnancies into a competition. And I would reach out and tell her that. \"I really want our babies to know each other as cousins. But I don't want our pregnancies to become a competition. When buying items on a similar budget, many Mums end up with the exact same items such as cots, especially as in online Mummy groups etc Mums will recommend the items that worked best for their family and child. I'm sorry you felt the need to replace your cot over this issue. I will be stepping back from your baby shower and the rest of your pregnancy so as not to cause you any more stress. I look forward to bonding over our babies in a few months time.\" NTA", "INFO:\n\nJust so we're clear about what has made your sister so angry:\n\nWas that cot a one-off, and you bought the only one in existence?\n\nOr does your sister believe you cannot both have identical cots?", "NAH - You're both pregnant and as you said yourself: \"pregnancy hormones do not help\". You'll probably look back at this and laugh about it together as your kids play together.", "You removed before I saw it so. Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like isn't that the point of sharing this stuff? \n\nId get it if it was stylish clothes or decorations. Things that are kinda personal.

Like in my family we have a red wooden cot that was once made by someone's granddad and we've kind of all been laying in there. My mom always said she's glad she never bought one because I didn't like staying there anyway. A baby has their own will, like you can't control if they like something you buy for them. Imagine spending $2000 on a cot and the baby just never really sleeps there lmao", "My 3yo still sleeps in it \ud83d\ude05. It's a big one tho, and can be converted to a smaller kid bed. Will convert it in a couple of weeks so they have a \"normal\" bed.\n\n\nNTA, it's a cot...
