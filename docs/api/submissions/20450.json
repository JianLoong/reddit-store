That\u2019s way beyond a hormonal issue. Has she always been like that?

It shouldn't be a shock or a surprise sisters have similar tastes and order the same furniture item from the only reasonably priced store in the area.\n\nI wouldn't go the baby shower if she's just doing to turn your pregnancies into a competition.

When buying items on a similar budget, many Mums end up with the exact same items such as cots, especially as in online Mummy groups etc Mums will recommend the items that worked best for their family and child.

It even holds true with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton where it's not about having something other rich people don't have, on the contrary its about rich people having all the same things so you find validation in your choices through that, while still getting a sense of identity through the fact that non rich people can't have them. \n\nStill NTA tho.

Your sister is about to become a mother and needs to learn how to control herself. Throwing a fit about something so arbitrary is ridiculous. \n\nDon't you apologise. You've done literally nothing wrong and it doesn't warrant it. She, however, *should* apologise. She's about to bring her child into the world and has more important things, by miles, to worry about you having the same cot when very few people are going to *see* the bloody things. It's highly likely no one would even notice because let's face who, other than your sister, gives a toss about a cot so long as baby has somewhere to sleep?\n\nETA: don't feel bad about the 2k she willingly spent on *another* cot.

Getting the same thing is good, especially if it is high quality!\n\n\nAlso, this post just reminded me that I need to buy my cousin some stuff off of her baby registry - thanks OP.", "There are expensive ones, but I really don\u2019t know why anyone would pay this much for a cot: https://www.johnlewis.com/boori-sleigh-royale-cotbed-with-mattress-white/p6300493", "Thank you for pointing that out, I definitely read the ages wrong \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05 I feel like that only makes it worse. Older sister wants to be the first one with the first grandchild and is jealous little sis is \u201cstealing her thunder.\u201d Either way, it\u2019s incredibly sad that instead of bonding with her sister and trying to be there and support one another that she chooses a cot to be the hill to die on.", "I think they are talking about a crib....but 2,000 dollars?\nIs it trimmed  in gold?", "I don't get along with my older brother but if I see something nice and practical that he vouches for, I'm getting it!\n\nLike with my sister (we get along), she bought an airfryer and swore by it. So we got the same type of model! Did she throw a tantrum? Hell no, she actually encouraged it!", "NTA. Your sister is out of her gourd. How utterly pretentious to have to buy a TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR bed for your baby because your sister purchased the same model you were going to buy. I feel bad for the baby.", "NTA. What am I missing here? You just ordered the same type of cot and she had a meltdown? Why? What could it possibly matter?\n\nIs your sister having g mental health issues? I'm serious.", "Is she going to fight every person that buys the same COMMERCIAL COT in the department store too? Like if she wants to be so special she can custom make EVERYTHING for her baby. She\u2019s being insufferable, but it could also be baby hormones making crazy crazier", "NTA. Is your sister always such a self-centred diva? There\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t get the same cot.", "NTA.\n\nShe is, however.", "NTA\n\nIt's a cot not a wedding dress", "INFO: So let me get this straight.... you bought a cot that she wanted and she felt compelled to buy a different model than the one you have, so she spent more money than she wanted to in order to have that different cot?  Then she yelled at you because of it?  Is that correct?", "NTA- as someone who is pregnant at the same time as a now former friend, it sounds like she\u2019s playing mummy Olympics with you. Making everyone thing big or small a competition.", "NTA.  It\u2019s a cot.  A place for your child to sleep in your own house.  Her child\u2019s cot is in her house.  They aren\u2019t going to be side by side (and in that case wouldn\u2019t it look better?).  What\u2019s going to happen if you get identical baby clothes? Is she going to have a meltdown if you use an identical burping rag?  Good grief your sister needs to get a grip, there are far more important things in life for her to worry about!", "NTA - its not like you took her baby name, its a cot. your sister may just be dealing with some intense hormones but that doesn't give the right to scream and call you names", "Even copying the room decorations.... who gives a rat's ass?\n\nThe child's room is going to change several times as they get older.\n\nA new bigger bed, a desk, dresser..... getting rid of the crib, change table, ..... letting your son build his own desk, because he broke his by pounding on it like a wild monkey when he was frustrated over something like school or video games or something..... patching the holes in the wall that they put in with their fists for being mad over something.....\n\nUhm... what was I talking about again?\n\nOh, yes.  Ahem.... things \\*will\\* change, hopefully for the better, but at least the furniture will be stronger. :-D", "I\u2019m Canadian and a lot of people call bassinets cots (Indian people for example I\u2019ve noticed) even if bassinet is more widely used.", "Oh, no, she stole the baby name.  Now I can't use it!  Because it was the only copy!"]}
