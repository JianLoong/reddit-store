{"id": 27241, "submission_id": "16n9gd7", "title": "AITA for having preferences over the sex of our child?", "selftext": "We are doing IVF, which means that we will know the sex of the embryos.\n\nI was born female. I am substantially older than the average Redditor, which means that when I was growing up there were no words to describe non-binary or trans people. The only word that existed in my community and the only word I could find in the earliest days of the internet when looking for it was \"transvestite\", which I was not, so I grew up as a girl/woman but hating every minute of it. \n\nTo this day, I present as a woman, because if I were to change now I would probably lose my career and my family.\n\nOn top of that, but separate from it, I also work in a heavily male-dominated industry. We are talking easily 90%+ male. At every step of the way, I have been discriminated against for being female. I was literally shut out from many opportunities, and I think the world is terribly unfair to quantitatively-minded females.\n\nThere are other traumatic experiences I can't describe here, but suffice it to say, I cannot personally recommend being female to anyone. I just can't see why it would be a good thing when you are objectively treated like shit.\n\nHowever, I am nothing if not fair: I recognize people have different preferences. I am lucky enough to have some mtf trans friends. So hopefully a female child would, statistically speaking, feel differently and actually like being female, and if not, hopefully they could do something about it and not have a life of misery like I did.\n\nBe that as it may, I do not think I am the right person to raise a female child because it would be too triggering. Sometimes when people have preferences over the sex of their child, it's because they imagine that if they have a female child they can do X with her while if they have a male child they can do Y with him. That's not it for me. For me, it's simply that I have too much trauma around having been born female.\n\nMy partner vehemently disagrees and thinks we should not care about sex at all. I agree that we should live in a world where sex does not matter, but I think that there are too many situations where if we had a female child, the world would treat that child horribly, and I would not be able to cope with that let alone help the child. I recognize that the world being unfair also means working with male children to teach them to do better, but I think I would find that less triggering. I also recognize that the child could always change their own sex, but I am not concerned about that because if they felt that freedom in a way that would be living my dream so of course I wouldn't be against that - it would be a beautiful example of how much the world has changed, even if it is still imperfect.\n\nGiven we are doing IVF, we have to make a choice either way. My partner knows about (some of) my experiences and why I feel this way but they don't really relate to it. AITA?\n\nEdit: For context, while this is a live issue and we disagree, my partner and I love each other very much and will stay together no matter what, even if that means not having a child because we don't reach agreement on this. We have been discussing this for what feels like a long time now with little progress. We're both committed to discussion and coming to a shared agreement and the default is that if we don't agree we don't have a child.", "created_utc": 1695176394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16n9gd7/aita_for_having_preferences_over_the_sex_of_our/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry, but there's a difference between having a weak preference and claiming trauma will prevent you from being a good parent.\n\nFrankly if having a child of a specific gender is triggering, you shouldn't be having a child at this time. Being a parent means being able to give them complete support no matter who they chose to be and putting every feeling you may have ever had to the side. I am sympathetic to your own struggles, but the moment you have a child that has to take back seat. What you are telling us is that it's not being put side; it's driving the hypothetical child off a cliff instead.     \nDoctors can simply be wrong. Intersex exists where regardless of what you want its not what you get. What if your child decides on its own that its a girl, - there's a difference to having friends and raising a child. Or what if they remain a boy but act in ways that you don't consider masculine enough and trigger you all the same? What if they're gay, or have autism, or a visual disfigurement that means they're going to be treated differently?", "Sorry but YTA  \nIf having a \\[female\\] child is bringing too much trauma, then you are not ready to have a child.   \nAnd by choosing a male baby, you are indeed doing this for sexist and mysoginistic reasons.

People all over the world have horrible experiences based on their gender, and other people have no issues with their gender. For example, I am a woman and have never really had anything negative happen to me that is gender based. \n\nI think before you go forward with having a child, you need to really work through your issues first.

I have landed on that I am nonbinary and genderfluid, and my presentation can shift pretty drastically, but when masc I am generally read as a more masc lesbian, not a man. And I'm not a man, and I don't want to be a man 90% of the time. I'm just also not really a woman a lot of the time. But no set of pronouns feels really *right,* and at least I'm used to she/her, so I just kind of go with the attendant assumptions on that most times. But I am a lesbian, so that's a different kettle of fish too. And like--none of this is *easy*\\-- being read as a woman isn't easy, being nonbinary isn't easy, etc etc-- but it's not like...oh I don't want to exist. It's like, ok, the world is shitty in a lot of ways, what can I do about it. And the world is shitty in a lot of ways that don't directly impact me, but which I care about, and I like to hope I'd care about all the stuff that does effect me even if it didn't, and approach it the same way. \n\nI'd also ask you to consider what happens if you have a male embryo, and a child assigned male at birth, and then that child tells you that actually she's a girl. Or they're not a girl or a boy. Or maybe he is a boy, but he's a gendernonconforming feminine gay boy. Or he's autistic or has ADHD, or a hundred thousand other things that could make life much harder than someone who doesn't have that characteristic. That uncertainty, those eventualities, those are all part of bringing any child into the world.

So I don't think you are an asshole at all, but I think therapy could help you get to a place where you have a better understanding of your own thoughts and feelings about this, and coping mechanisms that can help you with not projecting the trauma from your experience onto your child. It's very clear that you care about your future child and want to keep them safe from harm. There's no way in this world to do that completely.

I am substantially older than the average Redditor, which means that when I was growing up there were no words to describe non-binary or trans people. The only word that existed in my community and the only word I could find in the earliest days of the internet when looking for it was \"transvestite\", which I was not, so I grew up as a girl/woman but hating every minute of it. \n\nTo this day, I present as a woman, because if I were to change now I would probably lose my career and my family.\n\nOn top of that, but separate from it, I also work in a heavily male-dominated industry. We are talking easily 90%+ male. At every step of the way, I have been discriminated against for being female. I was literally shut out from many opportunities, and I think the world is terribly unfair to quantitatively-minded females.\n\nThere are other traumatic experiences I can't describe here, but suffice it to say, I cannot personally recommend being female to anyone. I just can't see why it would be a good thing when you are objectively treated like shit.\n\nHowever, I am nothing if not fair: I recognize people have different preferences. I am lucky enough to have some mtf trans friends. So hopefully a female child would, statistically speaking, feel differently and actually like being female, and if not, hopefully they could do something about it and not have a life of misery like I did.\n\nBe that as it may, I do not think I am the right person to raise a female child because it would be too triggering. Sometimes when people have preferences over the sex of their child, it's because they imagine that if they have a female child they can do X with her while if they have a male child they can do Y with him. That's not it for me. For me, it's simply that I have too much trauma around having been born female.\n\nMy partner vehemently disagrees and thinks we should not care about sex at all. I agree that we should live in a world where sex does not matter, but I think that there are too many situations where if we had a female child, the world would treat that child horribly, and I would not be able to cope with that let alone help the child. I recognize that the world being unfair also means working with male children to teach them to do better, but I think I would find that less triggering. I also recognize that the child could always change their own sex, but I am not concerned about that because if they felt that freedom in a way that would be living my dream so of course I wouldn't be against that - it would be a beautiful example of how much the world has changed, even if it is still imperfect.\n\nGiven we are doing IVF, we have to make a choice either way. My partner knows about (some of) my experiences and why I feel this way but they don't really relate to it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're not happy about either of those things, but that's still what you're telling us you're choosing to go by.\n\nSo I have another question; if you're reacting strongly to the term just here - how are you going to handle with having just given birth, being utterly wretched and exhausted, and hearing all of your loved ones tell your baby \"Oo, do you want to go back to mommy now?\" With being referred to in third person as 'mommy', rather than your name, by *absolutely everyone* important in your life for years and years going forward?", "Everything in your post implies that you still use female pronouns. You should\u2019ve stated that if you didn\u2019t want to be referred to as she/her. You are NOT capable of raising a child if you\u2019re this sensitive", "You were born female. Present as female. You did not at any point state your preferred pronouns. \n\nSo yes, she.\n\nAny child should be the biggest blessing to you, so if you don\u2019t feel capable of raising a child purely because she\u2019s female then don\u2019t have one at all.\n\nGo to therapy.\n\nYTA", "I literally said I am a woman and that my experience as a WOMAN has been positive. And yes, I\u2019ve faced all of these things you have said. But I\u2019ve also experienced lots of amazing things as a woman too, and to say that being a woman is so bad they would never want a daughter is quite sad to me. Because women are amazing.\nI would be curious to know if the op\u2019s partner is female too.", "And you are right, but it\u2019s not just down to women to fight for change. I\u2019m pretty vocal in establishing change with the men in my life too and challenging misogyny", "Same in Germany. Men aren't less intelligent or anything, girls as a whole are just pressured more into having good grades instead of playing computer games. \"Boys will be boys\". And when you have to have perfect grades, the good girls from next door have an \"advantage\" over the rowdy boys that go out and party. Stereotypes, I know, but they are mostly correct.", "It 100% will make her a bad parent.", "You're dodging the heart of the question here. You don't want a girl because of discrimination you faced for not being traditionally feminine/being transmasculine and closeted. How are you going to deal with it if you have a boy who isn't traditionally masculine according to the standards in your area (which the image in your head would've been shaped by) and faces similar discrimination?\n\nedit: small addition", "It's fair that they might encounter the same issues as a cis daughter, and then that could be an issue, you're right. I do think there would be a bit of a relief though that they could choose more freely than I did.", "OP can present as female but still have different pronouns, at least in safe spaces. They introduced themselves as not really female in this post, and I expect they use neutral or male pronouns with their husband and friends.", "Yea. We all need to fight for change and equality.", "They'd face more hardships than a cis daughter, you are making no sense. You are not prepared for this.", "Every trans person I know has faced so much shit because they\u2019re trans and coming out really isn\u2019t much easier nowadays on a personal level. You are so misinformed if you think it\u2019s easier for kids now that it would\u2019ve been for you when you haven\u2019t actually tried it", "Trans women did not choose to be women, they didn't \"choose more freely than [you] did\", the alternative was simply not existing as themselves, as a whole person.", "In safe spaces. Parenthood is not a safe space. It's raw and so is pregnancy and birth and all the other stuff that happens after.", "It doesn't mean people should misgender them on a Reddit post. I never said OP was ready to be a parent.", "Nothing in her post indicated she wants to be called him. She literally used words like mommy and that she lives as a woman. Really gotta wonder why use these words and then people trying to white knight on her behalf.\nWell cool, but you certainly try to reprimand people for using the same words she used.", "It isn't misgendering when they said they choose to present as a woman."]}
