I have a computer degree and work for the Ministry of education in my country. This is a very poor country, and most students have very limited access to technology. I started a program to teach programming and some basic of Linux to students, and has gone well so far. Part of the program also includes creating Kiwix (offline wikipedia) labs and in some schools, creating local clouds so files wont be lost of misplaced. \n\nIn one of the schools there is this student, a 15yo, who from the beginning has shown a lot of interest in learning. He is already doing some nice little projects, but his family is extremely poor so hi does what he can in an old Intel Atom notebook. I thought him how to use what little he can in that notebok using Linux and even upgrading to an SSD.\n\nI have many computers, but I think my favorite one is the Raspberry Pi 400, for those who doesn't know, it's a little ARM based computer built into a keyboard form factor, unaware people just see a keyboard with an unusual amount of ports, when they realize this is a full computer, their minds are blown. This might sound silly for people in the first world, but here this is top notch tech.\n\nSo, this one student has some fascination with this Pi. He touches as if it was made of crystal when I let him use it, and together we managed to do some cool stuff.\n\nHis birthday was this month, when I knew the date of his birthday, I decided to commit a sin. Buy a full Pi400 kit from a reseller (because these are nearly impossible to buy in official retails right now) and import it. It came right on time, and gave it to him as a birthday present.\n\nHe was so excited that started crying, and his family had no idea how to thank me. It melted my heart.\n\nThen I told this to my wife and my 8yo son, and they are mad at me. Apparently he wanted a pi for himself, just failed to communicate it, but they blasted me for giving a Pi to \"a random kid\" and when they saw the Pi arriving home, though I was gonna give it to him. They also told me that the student's family might 100% resell it since they're so poor. My son already has 3 computers, one of them a mid-budget gaming PC. He is also into software but is still too young to do more complex things. I dont know why he suddenly wanted a Pi so much. Neither of them are talking to me. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678841815, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rgxkf/aita_for_giving_a_computer_to_my_student_instead/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know what a Rasberry Pi is, it doesn't belong with an 8 year old anyway. The 15 year old will get more out of it.\n\nI hope he doesn't sell it. It doesn't sound like he will though. You must have made that young man's day. Good for you OP.", "While reading your post, your passion for teaching and inspiring younger people in your country was eye-catching. I am so thankful teachers like you exist, especially in countries where education, learning and inner motivation should be encouraged. I see, from my point of view, no problem with giving such a thoughtful en appropriate gift to one of your students, especially if they are as motivated to learn as you have told. I personally have worked with Raspberry Pi (still magic to me), so it is telling that your pupil and his family appreciate this thoughtful gift of yours. You likely changed your pupil's life, with your attention and the opportunities this creates for him. \n\nRegarding your wife and son's reaction, they expected you to give the Raspberry Pi to him without communicating this. Please consider why this is so! Is this normal behaviour for your wife?  I understand your very young son was expecting this new 'toy', especially when one of his parents might have told him it was a gift. But your wife's reaction regarding the student's family's acceptance of the gift was quite telling.\n\nShe might believe that a 'poor' family cannot appreciate this gift, and thus giving the Raspberry to your pupil is a waste of money. She expected you to always prioritise your children and thus assumed that you would have only bought such a gift for your family.\n\nConsider this point of view and make your own determination. With your son, take some time out of your day and talk to him. Try to explain how important teaching is to you and especially why, in an age-appropriate manner. Do explain that this student was very interested in the subject, and you wanted to foster his interest. And also considered the different ages of the people involved. \n\nRegarding your wife, your son is following her example of not talking. Short breaks to reduce emotions of tempers are okay ( 1-2 hours max.) however, extended periods of no communication are not healthy for relationships. I hope you can address this as adults in a healthy way. Do consider this, expenses as vast as the Raspberry Pi should be discussed in relationships, especially if children are involved.", "100 percent NTA - they saw it, presumably, and assumed it was for your son. I can understand your son being disappointed as a kid but your wife? \n\nPlus your son sounds a little bit spoilt with that much tech at his disposal. \n\nIt\u2019ll blow over. NTA and good luck.", "NTA, I feel like your wife should be more compassionate. This young boy shows a willingness to learn and this kit will be a game changer for him. Your son already has more then he needs.", "NTA I can understand an 8 year expecting a gift when it came to your home but his mother needs an adjustment. Talk with your son about how he is fortunate and others have less, some much less. Make him talk to you since you're the parent. It's sad if the other boy's family sells it but you gave it to him for the right reason. Your act was one for humanity.", "NTA for connecting with a student and helping him succeed by giving him a solid piece of hardware, but you should have discussed it with your wife and son first so you didn't blindside them. Your wife's suspicion about it being resold makes her TA. I don't care that she's mad you spent the money on someone else's kid without bringing her in on it, that's just a terrible thing to say. Your son though... how else is an 8-year-old supposed to take his dad 'secretly' buying a cool piece of hardware for someone else's kid? I'm not saying you were wrong to do it, I'm just saying him being hurt and mad at you isn't nessecarily unreasonable. He's eight.", "NTA. God bless you and what you did was beautiful. I love you and so does God. Please, never stop being kind. Thank you for posting this", "NTA - Does your family think you are only allowed to buy gifts for them? It's a good example for your son to show generosity to someone in need.", "Absolutely NTA!!!! You are an amazing teacher, and your students are lucky to have you. \n\nWhat a lovely, thoughtful gift for your student, and hopefully, he learns amazing things on the device. \n\nIt is a little disappointing to see your family not sharing in your joy, but I do sort of understand where they are coming from. It might seem you are going overboard in helping a student, and that is not something a teacher does. \n\nBut them framing it as you doing it at the expense of your son is unfair. Hope you can have a heart to heart with your son. I think he will understand soon. \n\nBest wishes, my friend!!!", "Your son suddenly wanted it because because he saw the box. I love the good deed but you didn\u2019t tell your wife?\n\nDo you guys not discuss big purchases?", "NTA. Sit down with your son and explain you are sorry for the misunderstanding and you never would purposely hurt him. That he is not ready for that computer yet. As a teacher you see children who you can help give them a chance to improve not only their lives, but the lives of their families and descendants. It is a great gift you have been given. If the roles were reversed, you would hope that your son would be blessed too.\n\nFor your wife, remind her that the energy she puts out comes back ten fold. She and your son are taken care of first and then you take care of others when given the chance. You obviously feel blessed and want to share what you are able to.\n\nThank you for creating knowledge and hope in our future.", "OP, you sure are NTA. \nI would like to share with you my experience as a daughter of a person who loves helping others. When I was child I too used to get jealous, but my mother and father had always instilled in me about sharing happiness. I would suggest you to talk to your child, and also your wife ofcourse. Discuss with them, how they already have everything they need and sharing happiness and helping others is very different kind of joy. Do not exclude them from your decision making process, because your son also needs to learn and to experience that everyone is not in advantageous position as them and it's a good habit to help others if you can. \nExplain to your son that when he will need the same kind of computer, you would give it to him too. If you don't talk to them, or explain them why you are helping others or who needs what, then your family might grow up to be resentful. \nHave you explained to your wife about that student and his talents? For your wife he might be a random child because she does not know him or feels any connection to him. If you talk about him, discuss about him, his hardships and also similar hardships faced by you, she might be able to connect with your decision.", "NTA- as a future educator I understand your stance and I think you did the right thing. You have a kind heart and the world needs more educators like you", "You sound like an amazing person and this is something he won\u2019t ever forget. The student that is. Your wife and son will forget about it soon enough.\n\nThanks for proving there\u2019s still some genuinely good people in the world!", "It's clear that your intentions in giving the Raspberry Pi 400 to the student were kind and generous. You saw a student with a passion for learning and limited resources, and you wanted to help him further his education and skills. It's natural for you to feel proud and happy about the positive impact you've made on this student's life.\n\nHowever, it's also understandable that your wife and son feel hurt and upset by this situation. Your son may have been excited about the idea of having a Raspberry Pi 400 and was disappointed when you gave it to someone else, even though he didn't communicate his wishes. It's important to remember that effective communication is key in any relationship.\n\nIn this situation, NAH (No A-holes Here). You were trying to do a good deed and support a student in need, but it's also valid for your family to feel hurt by your actions. The best way to move forward is to sit down with your wife and son and have an open conversation about what happened, acknowledge their feelings, and discuss how you can better communicate your intentions and desires in the future.", "You should have spoken with your wife about your plans.  Can you afford to buy your son one too?  Children can be very jealous of their parent\u2019s affection.  Don\u2019t ignore your students but put your family first.", "INFO - can you even do this without violating laws or professional ethics codes?", "Info: Are you aware that giving expensive gifts to minor students could be construed as unprofessional?

We celebrated his birthday in the classroom. I have a good relationship with his parents and I keep a good communication with them. Is not like I'm inviting him to take a coffee or going to his house when his parents are not there. Also both of us are men, so is weird to imply I might have any kind of grooming intentions with him.", "My thought the last time he posted this is why single out the one student for special attention?
