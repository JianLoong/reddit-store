But I don't get out much.  Lol", "I didn't know, but i am not an non pork eater so i would've been pleasantly surprised and happy xD", "My restaurant requires that from us! When I take an order, I will always ask if there\u2019s any allergies I need to share with the kitchen.", "With the current cost of food more restaurants will refuse to freely replace a meal. It\u2019s really not that hard to say we can\u2019t eat pork. Or pay for a new dish without the pork.", "I think it really depends on your cultural background. I didn\u2019t know what that was until I was in my early 20\u2019s (grew up and was educated in Canada)\n\nIf you\u2019re not of western descent I can see how someone wouldn\u2019t know the term", "Yeah, I've met plenty of people who had no idea lard even existed, because it's not a thing in their culture.\n\nI have also clearly stated to servers that I am vegetarian, and to please let me know if there is anything not veggie friendly. And they served me bacon \ud83d\ude11 (baked potato, had a green tick on the menu, served with bacon), or told us towards the end of the meal that the sauce actually had cow in it.", "It's almost like German stores would have a reason to know if something had pork or shellfish in it.", "Gonna get downvoted for this I'm sure but as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years, soft YTA.\n\n>On his way out of the restaurant, he told my manager that I was rude.\n\nYou were rude. How hard would it have been to say \"our apologies, I did not realize you couldn't eat pork. Prosciutto is a pork product, it's cured Italian ham. Let me check with the kitchen if we can remake this for you without pork\". You could have reacted to the situation much better than you did.\n\nThis could have easily been avoided with a simple question, as part of your due diligence you should be asking every guest (not only those who \"look Muslim\" whatever the hell that means) if they have dietary restrictions or allergies for this exact reason. This time it was thankfully something that wouldn't have made them sick. Next time it might be something that could have killed them. Yes, the onus should be on the customer to state their allergies or dietary restrictions but you need to take accountability for the fact that you also could have done something to prevent this from happening.\n\nYour customers are guests in the restaurant. They spend hard earned money (which includes your tip I imagine) to dine there. They could easily make pasta at home, but they chose to go out to pay higher prices because they are provided a service. You not only didn't do the bare minimum you can to prevent someone from eating something they're not supposed to, you also argued with them and blamed the customer. By no means do I think the customer is always right but in this case your customer wasn't wrong.", "I haven\u2019t eaten meat for 50 years and I know what prosciutto is.", "When you dine out do you ask if a dish is vegetarian? If not, you should. \nMuch like if you can\u2019t eat pork you should mention it.", "but they could have asked is the key here or googled.", "Eh, I've never heard of it either", "Agree, if you spend your whole life going to halal butchers then you would think it\u2019s some fancy herb or something.", "But, if you saw an ingredient you didn't know would you ask or Google?", ">The annoying part is people use coriander to mean cilantro when one means a seasoning derived from the seeds and one means the leafy bit.\n\nThe really annoying part is when a person who speaks a particular dialect assumes that their version is the only correct version.", "Coriander is the accurate name of the whole plant. \n\nThe seats are called coriander seeds, because it\u2019s a coriander Plant.\n\nBut it is commonly referred to as cilantro, and often labeled as such when sold in stores. So the leaves are both coriander and cilantro. But the seeds tend to only be referred to as coriander seeds.", "Exactly. Technically coriander is a spice made from the dried seeds, cilantro is an herb made with the leafy parts of the same plant.  I can taste the \"soap\" of cilantro, but coriander (the spice) doesn't bother me because whatever the alkaloid is that makes the soapy taste is dried up and mostly gone because of the drying process. I have heard some people use the term coriander in cooking shows when they are actually using the herb. \n\nIt USED to be, 40 years ago, nobody really knew what cilantro was, (where I lived at the time) but we always had coriander in our spice rack. It was always the full seeds, they looked a lot like pale, small smooth peppercorns to me the first time I noticed them. Didn't have an experience with cilantro until my first trip to Tiajuana at 27, and couldn't figure out why my taco tasted like a cross between wet dog and dish soap, but I will NEVER forget it! I found out a few days later when I asked my sister about it, she'd been living down in So Cal for a few years by then on the border, so was very familiar with wet dog soap tacos!", "Yeah... I don't think people realize how much animal fat or product exists in food. I have gotten into plenty of arguments with people when they tell me a dietary restriction and I didn't let them order food that has the ingredient in it. They insist I'm wrong.... Nope.... I know exactly what's in the food in serving and I'm happy to prove it to you.\n\nHopefully I don't ruin things for you...but when you go out to eat always check what the ingredients are in salsas. A LOT of salsas will utilize chicken bullion in place of salt.", "Same.got to always check", "They're wrong in that they blamed OP/the restaurant when they didn't ask about something they have a restriction for. This situation was entirely of their own making. \n\n>This could have easily been avoided with a simple question, as part of your due diligence you should be asking every guest (not only those who \"look Muslim\" whatever the hell that means) if they have dietary restrictions or allergies for this exact reason.\n\nI can't think of the last restaurant I went to that did this... Do I think that menus should be labelled and have an indicator for patrons to ask the staff if they have questions/concerns? Yeah. Do I think restaurants should literally spoon feed their customers? No. This seems like overkill to me. \n\nOn top of that, OP started off by advising them that it's literally listed on the menu, there's nothing wrong with that and it's not rude at all. Part of the problem in the industry is that we cater to people being shitty and entitled and remove all responsibility.", "I mean... Sure... but I'm talking about my part of the world?", "That\u2019s not actually true. The whole plant is actually called coriander.", "Lol, I had someone explain to me that the vegetable soup - made with chicken stock - was vegetarian because it didn't have lumps if chicken in it. Or there were just a few and I could pick them out.\n\nYeah, I practically interrogate restaurant staff.\n\n\nOh! And deep frying in lard isn't a thing in Italy, my Italian friends would never think to ask what type of oil was used for frying.", "Asking guests if they have allergies or dietary restrictions is hardly \"spoon feeding them\". Restaurant do have the responsibility to not kill their customers. Thankfully in this situation this wasn't a possibility, but it might have been. \n\nEvery restaurant that I have worked in, including those I have ran, ask about allergies. Why? Because when I first started in the industry I served someone with a nut allergy macarons. Guess what type of flour makes macarons? Almond flour. Everyone has probably had a macaron in their life but have you thought about what it's made with? \n\nThe whole point of the industry is to cater to the public, that's literally the definition of the word.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OP started off by advising them that it's literally listed on the menu\n\nObviously the dish would have had to be remade or something else would need to be offered regardless of who's \"fault\" this was. OP only said that to blame the guest. The customer paid for the food AND the service. They did not receive the service part of that.", "I would agree and I would say that trying to determine someone\u2019s religion based on their appearance, and then making suggestions to them based on the server\u2019s understanding of what some adherents of that religion do or don\u2019t eat, is not a good road for a server to be going down."]}
