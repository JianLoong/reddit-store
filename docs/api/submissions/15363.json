The responsibility of dietary restrictions falls on the person with the dietary restriction (or parents/guardians). Don't make assumptions about people especially based on how they look. However, to reduce incidents like this in the future, you could get into a habit of saying, \"Does anyone have dietary restrictions?\"", "NTA, I do not eat pork either so I make sure I read and re-read the ingredients of what I\u2019m about to order.

I didn't know there were two words for the same thing, I'd only ever seen cilantro, so it didn't occur to me to look it up- but the mistake was entirely on me. I did mention it to the waitress but just to explain that the reason I was ordering something else wasn't that anything had been wrong with the garlic knots.
