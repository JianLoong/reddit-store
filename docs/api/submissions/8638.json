My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister has a prescription drug problem. She dipped out for two weeks and ended up in another state. She called her mom in the middle of the night, begging her to come get her. Fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mom didn\u2019t feel safe traveling alone and asked if we could help. For multiple reasons, we decided to leave early the next morning and drive. \n\nAbout 3 hours away from our destination, we broke down and of course in the dead center of absolutely nowhere with a cell tower on AOL dialup. We took my truck, which is about 3 years old to actually prevent something like this from happening\u2026go figure. It ended up being a simple blown fuse but actually locating a replacement was the problem. My only option was to start walking to either pickup a signal and/or flag someone down for help. \n\nI walked closed to 5 miles before I hit some sort of fish farm. Someone there graciously gave me ride to find what I needed, then drove me back to my truck. After putting the new fuse in, because of course why not the battery was dead. My fianc\u00e9e was hot and had the key on to have air being pushed on her. Yes, I was irritated. Luckily, I always carry a battery charger. But it is slow as hell and took an hour to get it enough charge for the engine to turn over. \n\nWhat happened next, pushed me to my limit. We had brought a small cooler with 6 waters, a couple cans of Coke, some snacks in between stopping for actual sit down meals. It was all gone, not a single bottle of water left. What did my fianc\u00e9e say? \u201cI really need to pee.\u201d To be clear, I was thirsty as hell but I wasn\u2019t even worried about myself. Her mom has hypoglycemia, she had the shakes, she wasn\u2019t feeling good. This was NOT something we needed to happen along with the already miserable day we were having. \n\nI said something to my fianc\u00e9e about drinking and eating everything to which she said, \u201cI was bored.\u201d I could not find this woman\u2019s mother anything. Not even a crumb, not even a sip of water to take a pill. I couldn\u2019t get the truck started either of course. Out of frustration, I yelled at her for eating and drinking everything. I was nervous thinking things could turn worse. I arrogantly asked, just how entitled and selfish can you be not to set aside your own mother something when you know of her condition? She turned things on me and said I should have brought them food and water back. But I literally went to a fish farm and a auto parts store, plus I didn\u2019t know she was going to consume everything we had. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e\u2019s response\u2026\u201dI\u2019m 3 months pregnant you asshole.\u201d Her mom kept insisting she was ok, I could see in her face she was not. Finally the truck started, 7 miles later I find a gas station to get the poor lady some sugar and a drink. I\u2019m still disappointed with my fianc\u00e9e, if she doesn\u2019t care about her mom how am I going to know she\u2019ll care enough for our child?

I was shocked she didn\u2019t care enough about her mother\u2019s condition enough to at least save one can of Coke.

It never ceases to amaze me how many pregnant women turn into snowflakes,  use pregnancy as an excuse for anything and everything like they have multiple disabilities and like they are the only woman on earth that ever had a baby.

They were stranded on a hot day, it's understandable that they had the air on. It sucks that she ate and drank everything when her mom needed water to take her pills.
