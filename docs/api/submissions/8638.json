My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister has a prescription drug problem. She dipped out for two weeks and ended up in another state. She called her mom in the middle of the night, begging her to come get her. Fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mom didn\u2019t feel safe traveling alone and asked if we could help. For multiple reasons, we decided to leave early the next morning and drive. \n\nAbout 3 hours away from our destination, we broke down and of course in the dead center of absolutely nowhere with a cell tower on AOL dialup. We took my truck, which is about 3 years old to actually prevent something like this from happening\u2026go figure. It ended up being a simple blown fuse but actually locating a replacement was the problem. My only option was to start walking to either pickup a signal and/or flag someone down for help. \n\nI walked closed to 5 miles before I hit some sort of fish farm. Someone there graciously gave me ride to find what I needed, then drove me back to my truck. After putting the new fuse in, because of course why not the battery was dead. My fianc\u00e9e was hot and had the key on to have air being pushed on her. Yes, I was irritated. Luckily, I always carry a battery charger. But it is slow as hell and took an hour to get it enough charge for the engine to turn over. \n\nWhat happened next, pushed me to my limit. We had brought a small cooler with 6 waters, a couple cans of Coke, some snacks in between stopping for actual sit down meals. It was all gone, not a single bottle of water left. What did my fianc\u00e9e say? \u201cI really need to pee.\u201d To be clear, I was thirsty as hell but I wasn\u2019t even worried about myself. Her mom has hypoglycemia, she had the shakes, she wasn\u2019t feeling good. This was NOT something we needed to happen along with the already miserable day we were having. \n\nI said something to my fianc\u00e9e about drinking and eating everything to which she said, \u201cI was bored.\u201d I could not find this woman\u2019s mother anything. Not even a crumb, not even a sip of water to take a pill. I couldn\u2019t get the truck started either of course. Out of frustration, I yelled at her for eating and drinking everything. I was nervous thinking things could turn worse. I arrogantly asked, just how entitled and selfish can you be not to set aside your own mother something when you know of her condition? She turned things on me and said I should have brought them food and water back. But I literally went to a fish farm and a auto parts store, plus I didn\u2019t know she was going to consume everything we had. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e\u2019s response\u2026\u201dI\u2019m 3 months pregnant you asshole.\u201d Her mom kept insisting she was ok, I could see in her face she was not. Finally the truck started, 7 miles later I find a gas station to get the poor lady some sugar and a drink. I\u2019m still disappointed with my fianc\u00e9e, if she doesn\u2019t care about her mom how am I going to know she\u2019ll care enough for our child? She still says I\u2019m the asshole though, for yelling at her.", "created_utc": 1675033305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10oligo/aita_for_yelling_at_my_pregnant_fianc\u00e9e_for/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We had troubles along the way, broke down which delayed us by several hours. When I got our vehicle working, the battery was dead, the food was gone, as well as the drinks. My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mom was having low blood sugar symptoms. We had no way of helping her, I began yelling at my fianc\u00e9e for eating and drinking all the food while I was gone. I was shocked she didn\u2019t care enough about her mother\u2019s condition enough to at least save one can of Coke. She says I\u2019m the asshole because she\u2019s pregnant and that\u2019s no way to treat a pregnant woman.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her mother could have been in serious trouble and she selfishly ate because she was fucking bored. NTA. And pray she\u2019s not like this with the kid.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 had no consideration for anyone at all that day. Being bored and pregnant is not a reasonable excuse for what she did.", "NTA.  You were in a very difficult situation doing the best you could under terrible circumstances. Your fianc\u00e9e, pregnant or not, is a selfish person.  Her \"bored\" excuse is beyond lame.  Your fears about your child are well-founded.    Start thinking about custody now.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, being pregnant is not a free pass to be selfish. Her behavior was incredibly entitled. And then she got defensive??? This could have been a catastrophe for her mother and she didn't even care??? I'd be very concerned about your child's well-being if this is how she treats her mother", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is selfish af. Already feel bad for your future kid.", "NTA\n\nI thought I would be calling you one, however your fianc\u00e9's attitude is pretty gross. \n\nOut of boredom was her excuse? She's an AH.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is using pregnancy as an excuse for selfishness. It\u2019s not that hard to leave 2 bottles behind (seems like she drank at least 6) for her hypoglycemic mother and you, who had to walk 5 miles.  Are you sure you want to put up with this for the rest of your life?", "Being pregnant is not an excuse for endangering someone\u2019s life. NTA.", "NTA. She drained the battery while you were walking for help, and ate and drank everything so no one else, you the walker, or her own hypoglycemic mother could have anything on this crapfest of a trip.  \n\nShe was bored?  \n\nSelf centered people like her make terrible partners,and parents.", "NTA\n\nContrary to popular belief, pregnancy isn't an excuse for everything.", "NTA. Boredom, really?", "NTA.\n\nBeing pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entitled to everything. She knew how far you had to walk, didn\u2019t leave a water. She knew her mother had a medical condition, didn\u2019t leave a water. She also drank 6 waters and other beverages and ate snacks out of pure boredom\u2026 that\u2019s wild to me. Home girl wasn\u2019t even thirsty.", "NTA. She shouldn't be so Selfish. You told her that was all you both had. I understand she is pregnant but you did point that out.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough one, because I can imagine that being pregnant and having no idea when you'd be able to get underway again, after hours of waiting, would be damn frustrating. \n\nIt's not the decision to eat all the food that bothers me, that's a forgivable error. But -- assuming you are accurate in the retelling OP -- the complete lack of concern for her mother and you is the real issue. She's externalizing her decision and actions and blaming you, rather than holding herself accountable for her decisions.\n\nAnd that's pretty bad.", "NTA she said she was bored so her using the Im pregnant card is BS.", "NTA pregnancy esp 3 months! Is not a reason to be an arse even to her own mom! She's very inconsiderate and you better be ready for the next 6 months of hell! She's going to use pregnancy to justify her shitty behavior", "NTA I was expecting you to say she was 8-9 months pregnant.  3 months?  And she used that as an excuse to eat and drink EVERYTHING?  No no no. \n\nShe needs to check her attitude and realize the world does not revolve around her.  I hope her mom is ok.", "NTA. Three months pregnant?  Big deal.  It never ceases to amaze me how many pregnant women turn into snowflakes,  use pregnancy as an excuse for anything and everything like they have multiple disabilities and like they are the only woman on earth that ever had a baby.  Used to be pregnancy was a totally normal thing, and the woman might need a little extra sleep and some crackers.", "NTA but if pregnant and acting crazy, they will continue that behavior the entire pregnancy and there isn\u2019t much that can be done about it.", "NTA. Your fiancee is very entitled and self-centered. The further along this pregnancy gets the worse that this is going to get. Good luck", "Don\u2019t EVER think YTA in this! SHE is the ASSSSSSHOLE!\n\n\u201cI was bored\u201d??? Are you SERIOUS!?! Didn\u2019t offer your own MOM something to eat and drink?!? YOUR OWN SICK MOOOOM?????? Didn\u2019t even stop and think that you WALKED all that time just to get help and just MAAAAYYYBEEE you\u2019d be exhausted and hungry!! Why THEE FUCK would I bring YOU food back, have you lost your mind?? And you can\u2019t roll down the windows so you\u2019re not hot???????? WHY RUIN THE TRUCK MOOOORE??? This makes me mad just reading it, I know you were fuming!! \n\nAnd you\u2019re only 3 months pregnant, wtf?? Her actions are gross af. How in the FUCK you drink 6 whole waters??? That\u2019s a small case of water! I\u2019m confused af. So gross! You are in no way the asshole, only her!!", "In a couple hours time she drank six bottles of water and a couple cans of coke? This sounds made up.", "I was going to say E S H until you said she was 3 months. \n\nNTA. Pregnancy is no excuse for selfishness, especially when doing *her* a massive favour. She sat there, fat dumb and happy, nice and cool, running down your battery, eating and drinking all the food, while you sorted out your emergency. I'd have yelled, too.", "ESH except the mom. They were stranded on a hot day, it's understandable that they had the air on. It sucks that she ate and drank everything when her mom needed water to take her pills. Though you could have gotten more waters when you got the stuff for the vehicle. Yelling at her in an already unpleasant situation didn't make anything better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
