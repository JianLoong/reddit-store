I've been shopping for the entire family, not just the kids, wrapping all the presents and making sure everyone has a good Christmas, what mom's do.\n\nI told my husband all I want are earrings months ago, simple. I know he's been very busy at work so I was not worked up that he has not gotten me a gift yet, but then today I saw him hand our 22 year old female au pair a gift. I also got her multiple gifts, because again, the mom makes Christmas happen for everyone. The only person who does not have a gift under the Christmas tree is me.\n\nAITA for being upset at my husband for having the time to get the au pair a gift, but says he's been too busy to get mine. I had to ask him to leave the house today so I could have a gift under the tree before Christmas comes, I did not want to be embarrassed when Christmas comes and everyone opens presents except for me. And right when he left, I broke down and cried because forcing someone to get you a gift is so meaningless, I wish I didn't ask, or wish I didn't have to ask.\n\nWhen I told him how upset it made me that he got another woman a gift first and that I won't have anything, he told me to act \"like an adult.\"\n\nAITA for asking him to get me a present?  I would just break down in front of the kids if on Christmas they ask me why I don't have any gifts to open.\n\nINFO EDITS 1: for those of you asking how I know my husband did not get me anything - well, I asked \"am I going to get a gift in time for Christmas?\" - after I saw that he got the au pair a gift.  He said he would have to \"leave the house now\" if that were to happen, which is when I asked him to go and get me a earrings at a store before stores close for the holiday.  I'm not even asking for nice Tiffany's earrings, something at Banana's Republic or J. Crew would do.  It's just so I have *one* gift to open during Christmas.  \n\nINFO EDITS 2: he got her a $50 box of chocolate.  Not a necklace from Love Actually.

That is a big deal. Pregnancy and childbirth is extremely tolling. He should be worshipping the ground you walk on. You gave him a family.", "Nta.

Not quite willing to jump to assumptions, but it\u2019s definitely hurtful.

It could have been done in 5 minutes.", "NTA. Don\u2019t be surprised if he has feelings for her. How is she towards him? Is this the first inkling of something being off with your husband? My suggestion is to not make a big deal about this and in the new year tell him you are considering letting the au pair go as something wasn\u2019t done quite right. See what he says. If I ever needed an au pair I would make sure she is 20+ years older than me.", "Simple. Remove all of his gifts from under the tree and return them Monday.", "Coming from a guy, there's a 90% chance he's either cheating on you with her or trying to.", "NTA.  What he is doing is completely unacceptable.  He has no respect for you what so ever!   What did he buy the au pair.  Personally she would be getting a gift of a new job somewhere else.

I work full time, got to school full time, and have two part time jobs. \n\nMy Christmas tree is literally filled with presents for my partner just like it is every year.", "NTA and if you stay together do the one-year-no-gift diet. He gets squat for all gift giving events (anniversary, bday, etc.) until he gets off his ass and reciprocates. And use the money you would have spent on him on yourself.\n\nIf he doesn't change within the year, you can decide if this is a relationship worth staying in.", "I'm confused about why you are purchasing gifts for him? If he doesn't want to do adult gift exchange that goes both ways. My husband and I don't exchange gifts and only buy for the kids in our lives, nothing wrong with that. But it sounds like you are going all out for him even when he can't be bothered to reciprocate. I'd be taking all but one gift for him away from the tree so he can see what it's like to have one or no gifts to open.", "All I read was the title, my Uber is watching me type this.   Wtf.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd I\u2019m pretty appalled that that\u2019s the only gift you\u2019ll be getting.  All of the decent husbands I know not only shop for their spouse, if there are kids, they help the kids buy or make gifts for their other parent.  Hell, my dad did that every year until we were teens, and then he gave us money to shop for mom ourselves until we were young adults.  My sister and I almost always had more presents to open that my parents did, but I can\u2019t think of a single year where they didn\u2019t each have at least 5-6 presents on Christmas morning.", "Nta", "What did he get her?

He just doesn\u2019t care.  I would hate to blame the au pair but honestly she is in the cross fire now.\n\nYour husband\u2019s response is the problem.  You need to tell your au pair she needs to stay away on Christmas and explain why and explain this is now causing issues.  She might be completely innocent but until you and your husband can resolve this she needs to stay out of family time.\n\nThen demand couples counseling and demand he work less.  If he values the marriage he will do it.", "NTA. You should be asking the au pair if he's making advances on her, this is not okay. I feel like you're overlooking a major red flag here, your husband is being inapropriate and you have to find out if the au pair is welcoming this behavior or not.", "NTA.\n\nI guess I have both been on Reddit too long and watched Love, Actually too many times to not immediately think there's smth going on with him and the au pair.. \n\nWhy tf is he \"too busy\" to get YOU a gift but not HER??\n\nAlso, next year, if you're still with him, don't get him anything. See if he likes to be reminded to \"act like an adult\"...", "NTA but your husband is. You should be asking yourself why is he so attentive and generous towards the au pair, which btw, might be time to fire her and care for your own children. Don't accept this behavior from him. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but he's treating another woman much better than he's treating you.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou need to re-examine your relationship with him, are there ways he even makes you happy and lucky you're with him? Does he also make you feel like shit in other ways and gaslights you into thinking you're the unreasonable one?  If on a special occasion he is like this, what more the rest of the year. Such callous disregard. No one deserves to beg for genuine affection from their own spouse, OP. \n\nPay closer attention to your husband and the au pair's interaction. However, it's really your relationship with your husband you need to reflect on more, you cannot patrol him from other women forever. \n\nIf you do not feel loved, there is probably none.\n\nAnd, if you do (and most likely you did), stop shopping for his side of the family like you're his secretary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just can\u2019t with the idea of a spouse who can\u2019t be bothered to have ONE thing under the tree for their spouse, when I have such clear memories of my parents making sure that not only did they give good gifts, they taught their kids to give to both because everybody should feel loved/valued/thought about for Christmas.", "Au pairs are young women from foreign countries.

He of course bought gifts from himself, but he also took the kids shopping to buy presents for mom (and friends, and other relatives) every Christmas.

You shouldn\u2019t have to do ALL the work, and you absolutely shouldn\u2019t be made to feel immature for wanting your husband to get you a gift for Christmas. It is not okay for him to place another woman above you in importance. It is not okay for him to be so uninvolved with his kids that they literally wouldn\u2019t have any presents if you didn\u2019t get them yourself, and most of all, his reaction is very not okay. I know it hurts, but please take some time to reflect on things with your husband. Is he always like this? Are there other, similar instances of him dismissing you that you\u2019ve been overlooking? Is he involved with his children? And, I know you especially probably don\u2019t want to go here, but do you trust him? Could he be having an affair or looking to have an affair? Because I can\u2019t imagine placing someone else above my partner like this. I\u2019m really sorry about all this, OP. Your husband is not treating you how you deserve to be treated at all. You deserve much better.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that you mentioned in another comment that he usually gives you your gift after Christmas. Why is that? This makes me feel like you\u2019ve gotten used to his AH behavior and are justifying it to yourself. Someone who genuinely loves you can make the effort to get you your gift on time. Sure, if he was late one year, that\u2019s not a big deal, but if this happens all the time, that\u2019s also not okay. You put forth effort for people you care about.
