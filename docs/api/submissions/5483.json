If he doesn't want to do adult gift exchange that goes both ways. My husband and I don't exchange gifts and only buy for the kids in our lives, nothing wrong with that.

All of the decent husbands I know not only shop for their spouse, if there are kids, they help the kids buy or make gifts for their other parent.  Hell, my dad did that every year until we were teens, and then he gave us money to shop for mom ourselves until we were young adults.  My sister and I almost always had more presents to open that my parents did, but I can\u2019t think of a single year where they didn\u2019t each have at least 5-6 presents on Christmas morning.", "Nta", "What did he get her?

He just doesn\u2019t care.  I would hate to blame the au pair but honestly she is in the cross fire now.\n\nYour husband\u2019s response is the problem.  You need to tell your au pair she needs to stay away on Christmas and explain why and explain this is now causing issues.  She might be completely innocent but until you and your husband can resolve this she needs to stay out of family time.\n\nThen demand couples counseling and demand he work less.  If he values the marriage he will do it.", "NTA. You should be asking the au pair if he's making advances on her, this is not okay.

See if he likes to be reminded to \"act like an adult\"...", "NTA but your husband is. You should be asking yourself why is he so attentive and generous towards the au pair, which btw, might be time to fire her and care for your own children. Don't accept this behavior from him.

Does he also make you feel like shit in other ways and gaslights you into thinking you're the unreasonable one?  If on a special occasion he is like this, what more the rest of the year. Such callous disregard. No one deserves to beg for genuine affection from their own spouse, OP. \n\nPay closer attention to your husband and the au pair's interaction. However, it's really your relationship with your husband you need to reflect on more, you cannot patrol him from other women forever. \n\nIf you do not feel loved, there is probably none.\n\nAnd, if you do (and most likely you did), stop shopping for his side of the family like you're his secretary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unless the gift was along the lines of \u201cthe same $10 Starbucks gift card I gave the kids\u2019 sixty-five-year-old elementary school teacher,\u201d this is strong Alan Rickman in Love Actually vibes.", "Impress her by\u2026 being a shitty husband haha! Like what\u2019s this girl supposed to think? Wow, he committed to his wife and he treats her like shit, so yeah! Sign me up! Haha \n\n\n\nHow pathetic.", "I would have been fine if he didn't get me a gift or get a gift after Christmas, but the moment I saw him hand a gift to the au pair, my heart just stopped....", "Cf the Alan Rickman-Emma Thompson story in Love Actually.", "https://youtu.be/FOVCtUdaMCU", "LITERALLY MY THOUGHTS TOO OH MY GOSH.", "Ugh that movie! So depressing. \ud83d\ude29", "A movie", "I thought so!!", "Is that a good movie?", "This is worse. Alan Rickman bought his wife something (the Joni Mitchell CD) in addition to having an affair and buying his secretary a gift.", "At least she got a CD!", "We should ask if the au pair got a gold bracelet.", "Either something is going on or he's creepy.", "Get a new au pair*", "Nope I'm not getting involved in this one. Oh yeah NTA", "You'd think if he was cheating he would be better at making is less obvious??", "Keep the au pair, ditch the husband.", "That's what I was thinking. Get an older, uglier au pair and see what hubs does.", "probably a good idea to get rid of them both!", "Most of the time, it's after Christmas, so I was not upset that he did not get me anything yet.  I only got upset when I saw him give another woman a present.", "We both got kids presents first, and I knew he had the kids' presents ready.  I would have been fine if he really did not have time to get presents for me, but when I saw him giving a present to another woman, I just died inside...", "And maybe buy yourself earrings with the proceeds?", "Then buy yourself nice earrings with the money", "And hire a divorce attorney with the money!", "And buy yourself something nice with the refund money", "My father used to take me to help him pick out gifts for my mother. He actually had good taste and I think he just wanted the company. But I could see the love in his eyes. I just made myself cry.", "Love Actually", "And the age of his grandmother.", "I asked him if I'm going to have a gift by the time Christmas comes, and he says he would have to \"leave the house and buy a gift now,\" which is why I asked him to go out and buy me a gift before Christmas.", "Because I wrapped everyone's gift under the Christmas tree EXCEPT for his gift to the au pair.  So I had to ASK the husband to go out before the stores close to get me a gift.", "What a mean prank to play.", "How does having an au pair make OP an asshole? You seem to be using that as part of the justification for your judgement when it literally has nothing to do with the conflict.", "Former au pair here. There are a lot of au pairs that end up in the middle of family drama, and husband  doing stuff like this was number 1 reason of drama and rematches (au pair needs to leave the family). Your husband's behavior may be innocent, but it may also make the au pair uncomfortable. It's not a gift from the family, but from the husband. This seems to cross a line both with the au pair and with OP, the wife. NTA", "I wrapped every single gift under the Christmas tree myself, the only one I did not wrap was the one my husband got for the au pair.  He's getting me a gift now because i ASKED him, that's why I am asking reddit if i am the asshole for ASKING him to get me a gift.", "How about getting a gift for the woman who carried and birthed those kids of his? The live in nanny is just doing a job, that\u2019s it. Also when she asked him, he would have said \u201cof course I got you a gift, you are getting it Christmas\u201d instead of \u201cact like an adult\u201d. For that comment alone he is an AH.", "22 yr Olds often times become enamored when an older  man pays attention to them. The gifts and compliments...the shitty husband part won't even occur to her til it's far too late.", "The old \u201che likes me the most so he treats me like a princess\u201d shit. Some people really go for it sadly enough.", "I'm sorry to say, but gut feelings are often right.\n\nIf he can buy a gift for someone that works for you, he has time to buy one for the person he apparently loves.", "You should not be fine with not getting a gift. This societal expectation that \u201cmoms make Christmas happen\u201d is unbelievably toxic. It should stop immediately. If I have time to work, split parenting and household duties with my husband AND buy him a gift, he has time to buy me one too. The fact is, a majority of men have been ALLOWED to not make holidays a priority. I don\u2019t understand this at all. My husband gives me incredible gifts because he MAKES IT A PRIORITY and fits it into his schedule like every other adult.", "What did he get her?", "Haven't seen it, duly noted. Emma Thompson still shoulda seen that marinara everywhere and BOLTED \ud83d\ude02", "Amazing movie!", "Not to be \"that\" person but it was a necklace. One of Emma Thompson's lines was actually \"is it a necklace...and love?\". Saddest scene of all times! You could see her heart actually breaking \ud83e\udd7a", "That was so painful to watch.", "*get a new husband too", "The husband will probably sleep with the new one too.", "I don't get out much. What is an \"au pair\"?", "OP should wrap one more gift for the husband: a box of condoms.", "Nah. Some cheaters are bold or sloppy like that.", "Get rid of them both", "I can understand where it may not be the girls fault (depending) but yeah its shady", "I can understand that. You are definately NTA . And maybe make it clear that in future you want your gifts on Christmas day, just like the au pair gets!", "I'm so sorry that he can't even hit the very very low bar of buying you one (1) gift that you specifically picked out on time for the holiday. Unless he's this disorganized regularly, including at his job, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that he just doesn't make you a priority.\n\nWhatever is going on with the au pair, you deserve better.", "NTA op - You are absolutely right to be upset. You organised every gift, your husband only really had to organise one\u2026..and he instead got one for another girl? At best, it\u2019s insensitive and ridiculous and at worst it\u2019s kinda suspicious. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e thinks you should watch \u2018love actually\u2019 with your husband and see if he realises how bad this looks. I think your husband shouldn\u2019t get any presents if he can\u2019t even get one for you but I\u2019m petty.", "INFO WHAT DID HE GET THE AU PAIR", "Yes, found that, thank you!  It was gonna drive me crazy.", "You deserve better than this.", "Did he admit he hadn\u2019t gotten you anything yet?  Not sure what time zone you are in, but where I am I feel like I have a good 24 hours left to wrap gifts (and like true procrastinators we have wrapped almost nothing).", "It's the whole conflict.  He got a present for someone whose life for now is raising their kids. Not to mention, she is leaving out what the present was or his reasoning.  Just trying to make him look as bad as possible.", "If I were you I would open the gift (I assume it\u2019s still under the tree) to see what it is. It should be from both of you, and not a secret if he hasn\u2019t told you what he got her. Close it back up, have a great Christmas and sit him down the day after for a serious talk about respect and boundaries.", "I'm a little curious too. Husband is still the AH, but there is a difference between going out jewelry shopping and picking up a Wendy's gift card during lunch.", "Joni Mitchell CD", "That's a good question. And was it wrapped? If he took the time to pick something out and wrap it I'd absolutely be pissed!", "I saw the movie once when it first came out and I wasn\u2019t gonna go google to see if my bracelet recollection was correct. \n\nPoint being, the gold piece of jewelry was not for the wife.", "I got that heart-squeeze-pain thing as I typed it.  Brutal scene. :(", "Is this a reference?", "A live-in manny?", "It's like he wants to get caught.", "Also how hurtful it is when he's thinking of everyone else, but not his wife.  That's making a statement.", "I asked him that since he got the au pair present, am I going to get mine before Christmas day, he said he would have to \"leave the house now\" if I were to have a gift in time.  \n\nThere's always the remote possibility that he ordered online today and it would come after Christmas.  But still, having time to get the au pair a gift FIRST, and mine AFTER Christmas makes me upset.", "Yeah you get your nanny a joint family present. It is really weird that the husband got the nanny a present from just him and not from the family. Way to make the nanny uncomfortable.", "He doesn\u2019t need help looking bad - not getting his wife a Christmas present when he\u2019s fully financially capable of doing so is grade-A AH behavior. The fact that he got the nanny one just elevates it to a whole new level of AH. This is at best a thoughtless guy, but possibly much worse given the nanny angle.", "\"Someone's whose life for now is raising their kids\" ah yes, the children that just spawned and didn't just come out of OP after eight months of intensive physical soul sucking gestation. Get real, please. What reasoning could make him look good?", "The movie Love Actually. He bought his wife a Joni Mitchell CD and the bracelet she thought was for her was given to another woman.", "To Love Actually. So heartbreaking that scene", "Why will you now answer what he gave her?", "Is it possible your gift is a surprise?", "Info: did he select and purchase any gifts for the children or teachers or parents or friends or was that all left to you and the only person he got a gift for was the au pair?", "NTA. That hurt my feelings on your behalf. \n\nAll inquiring minds want to know: what did he get her?", "Ooooh snap. Is it worth a watch?", "Wasn't it a gold heart necklace? Not a bracelet.", "If you've reduced your wife to tears in service of a \"surprise,\" it's time for it to not be a surprise anymore, imo.", "It\u2019s actually set at Christmas time so you might want to give it a watch.", "I missed that part. Yeah sounds like a dick"]}
