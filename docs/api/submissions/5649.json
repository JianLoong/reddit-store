Instead of taking me home after, he stopped for an oil change because it was on the way. So I sat uncomfortable and physically exhausted sitting in a waiting room at a car shop. \nSo yeah, I\u2019m struggling to find a reason to stay. I feel some sort of way about the fact that he almost died from Covid and was hospitalized for 3 months. That\u2019s when I started therapy due to panic attacks from MIL horrid behavior. 6 months ago I had to save his life when he went into cardiac arrest and then fight to get him to a hospital that could save his life. He recently said he felt that was my destiny, why I came into his life\u2026was to be there to save him. I know he\u2019s been through hell these past couple of years with Covid and heart issues but he acts entitled like it\u2019s my job to wait on him. I\u2019m having a hard time finding the love for him right now.", "Truth.", "He should be worshipping the ground you walk on! You deserve better. As horrific as his medical situation was, it does not obligate you to stay with. \n\nGet yourself a divorce lawyer for the new year- then you know it will be a happy one!"]}
