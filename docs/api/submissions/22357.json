So that was frustrating but I let it go. \n\nI had asked my immediate family (mom, dad, brother, and our youngest sister) to wear colors to match our wedding theme (purple, black, or silver).

It must've been so hard FOR YOU when your brother got hurt. What a selfish guy.", "YTA. WTF! Your sibling had an accident with serious injuries and your whining about not having as much help and how his cast and stuff stand out in photos? Worst sibling of the year award right here!!!", "YTA. There's photoshop yknow. You can just use a photo editing program to change the colour of his casts. That's really cold of you to exclude him because of his medical accident. You could've also taken more photos too, some with all immediate family and some without. What's the problem if the photographer take a few more photos with him also in it.", "YTA. Your brother doesn't count as immediate family? Or your \"perfect photos\" wouldn't be so perfect with evidence showing of his near brush with death?", "YTA. I hope the color cohesion in the photos matters more to you in 10 years than your relationship with your brother does.", "YTA I understand \u201cmy  wedding my choice\u201d but your brother was in an accident for crying out loud!

You sound entitled and you have zero empathy. Yes, it\u2019s your wedding date  and you absolutely are welcome to ask family and wedding party to match your color theme.

This is sarcasm. Weddings are NOT the most important things in people\u2019s lives though the brides of today don\u2019t seem to understand that.

Who do you think will be displaying the photos except for you?  Your parents will probably be ashamed and replace the picture on the mantle with something that has all of their kids and spouses.

Where\u2019s your empathy? While it is your wedding and you do have the right to make decisions about the photos, you have to understand and accept your family\u2019s reactions to them. You prioritized aesthetics over your relationships.

How is this even a question.", "YTA. You have an ego, not an aesthetic.", "Gah! \n\nEver hear of photoshop you widgette?\n\nYTA", "OMG - YTA!!  GTFU......", "YTA.

I know your wedding day is important. But life truly isn\u2019t fair and you need to value your family relationships over your wedding day. I had my entire wedding day planned. Six weeks before the wedding my future FIL got sick and would no longer be able to travel to the wedding. I cancelled my entire wedding and replanned it in SIX weeks in the rural town where my husband grew up. Was it the wedding I always envisioned? No. But it was more important to me to have my husband have his parents in attendance than for me to have my perfect vision. It is a single day of your life. Your marriage and relationships are more important.", "YTA how nice of you to let it go though that the parents helped your brother! Couldn\u2019t you have had photos with him both with and without anyway? Like you would have had photos with just your parents anyway?

Dude was in multiple casts!!", "YTA if you care so much about the aesthetic of the pictures you should have just paid for color correction for the casts.", "YTA\nThe unmatching colors can be easily fixed by the photographer in the final edit. Not because he is in a cast, he is not part of the immediate family. I understand it is your wedding, but to make him an outcast, it's wrong.", "Wow!

Kicking your brother out of the family photos because his casts were red and blue was crappy of you -- Photoshop exists for exactly things like this. \n\nBut in your shoes, I'd have been hurt if my parents opted completely out of all wedding planning/prep to cater to my younger brother (though from the way you've worded this, I'm not sure if you're saying you wanted to relegate chores to your parents--not great--or if you wanted to do wedding stuff with them).\n\nYour wedding photos are something you're going to have for however long this wedding lasts -- your brother's casts were temporary.

Especially, since you didn't paint a picture of your brother being estranged or not on good terms with you or the groom. Like, wow! \n\nI hope this did not raise any red flags with hubby or the in-laws. I mean, a woman willing to ostracize her brother because his injuries did not fit her aesthetics does make you wonder how seriously she takes the phrases for richer or poorer, in sickness and health.

An unredeemable AH if you genuinely cannot see how anyone would think that of you, considering what you did (alienated an injured family member for the mere purpose of thought, because no matter how perfect you think your wedding photos are, someone will always find a flaw. In this scenario, I suspect it will be the missing injured brother). Be prepared to be the talk of both families.
