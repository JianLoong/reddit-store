I feel my intentions are being sorely misunderstood & dissimilar comparisons are being made. I\u2019m sorry if what I\u2019ve said is offensive to anyone. I was simply trying to find a way to include the youngest kiddos so they didn\u2019t feel left out. I was not implying the older ones don\u2019t deserve nice things. None of this is deep enough to fight about. Everyone should do whatever is best for them & each one of us has different perspectives. To each their own. I\u2019m done trying to explain my good intentions that were misconstrued as suggestions to take anything away from the older kids. I grew up with an older stepbrother who got whatever he wanted & a stepmother who neglected me so maybe I\u2019m just sensitive & don\u2019t want any kid to feel left out of simple things like hot chocolate.

This shouldn't affect your wife's bonding ritual with the older girls. My mom used to take me to the gas station almost every morning when she bought her treats for the day, and always let me pick one out to bring to school, too. It's a cherished memory, 30 years on.

You are sending the message that they are not worth the same as the other children. Children have such a sensitivity to fairness. You wife and older kids need to clean up the cups. Ewwe.

Stop giving them crap drinks and coffee!", "NTA I think with a large age gap, it's fair to say there are some things older kids can have that younger ones can't.

Is it easily affordable, or is this breaking the budget?", "NTA but the problem could be solved by a decent home coffee bar then everybody could have everything they want and it wouldn't be a point of contention.", "NTA - that is a colossal waste of money.  Should a 14 year old even be drinking coffee regularly?  It is important to teach kids good spending habits early on; your wife is really not doing them any favors by turning something that should be an occasional treat into a daily expectation.", "NTA, but I think you all could really benefit from a nespresso machine or something. They\u2019re kind of pricy but with the amount of money you\u2019ll be saving from skipping on Starbucks every single weekday, it\u2019ll pay for itself really quickly. It also doesn\u2019t take that much time in the mornings. If you get one with a steaming wand, you can do some steamed milk for the little ones and they won\u2019t feel left out", "NTA. Keurig, box of pots and reusable Starbucks cups and everybody gets \u201cstarbucks\u201d at home.", "I only read the caption...just based on that I would not only say NTA! I would also say what an enormous waste of money!!!!", "YTA\n\nStop wasting money at Starbucks. Buy a machine to make them hot chocolate.", "NTA. Consider making it a double-digits thing.
