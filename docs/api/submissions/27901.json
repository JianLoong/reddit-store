She was the first one that came to us and we spent nearly a month in the hospital and she needed a feeding tube when she came home. Mila has some special needs that are a direct result of that home. \n\nA few months ago we got a call asking if we could take a 14 year old girl, Cassie, from the same home that Mila was in. Cassie\u2019s needs aren\u2019t as severe as Mila\u2019s but between that and the fact that she\u2019s years behind in school normal schooling would\u2019ve been difficult for her. \n\nMy sister was a teaching assistant for special ed at our local school district. It was so bad that she didn\u2019t even last a year there.

My wife got a job in the office there so we got cheap tuition for Mila and eventually Cassie when she started school there. The girls are doing great at this school and we\u2019re considering moving closer to it to make life a little easier. \n\nThe issue is my wife, Mila, and Cassie are out of the house by 6:30 every morning. Cassie is up by 5:30 and Mila is up by 6. They\u2019re all tired when it\u2019s time to go to school and work so as a treat, they go to Starbucks every morning. Mila gets a hot chocolate, Cassie is allowed to get a small coffee, and my wife gets a coffee to help them get through the morning. \n\nThey are not always the best at getting the cups out of the car by the time the younger two see it and lately they\u2019ve been throwing temper tantrums every morning when we pass by a Starbucks. \n\nMy wife thinks we should just get it for them but I don\u2019t want to.
