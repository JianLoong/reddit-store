He was the main bread winner so SIL has been struggling but my mom and I help her out as much as we can. \n\nThis passed weekend I has tickets for a concert with my boyfriend in the city that I have really been looking forward too. SIL asked me to watch my nephew so she could run some errands. I agreed but I told her I had a train I needed to take and what time I needed her to be home by. That time came and went I called her multiple times with no answer. My train came and went. By the time she got home it would make no sense for me to go it would be over by the time I got there. My boyfriend was waiting for me in the city and never went in to the concert because he didn't want to go without me since I was so excited for it. Both tickets were wasted.\n\nWhen she got home she apologized and said she just has so many errands to run that she lost track of time. She said she never gets a chance to get things done because she works two jobs and she has a ton of things to get done. She once again said sorry and offered to cook me dinner I declined and went home. \n\nThe more I thought about it the angrier I got so the next day I texted her asking if she could reimburse me for the tickets. She replied that she simply didn't have the money and was struggling and once again she was very sorry. \n\nI asked my mom to say something to her but she won't. She asked me to just drop it because SIL is a window and has it hard enough and is struggling enough. She said is the worst thing in my life is missing a concert I am lucky and I have no idea how hard SIL has it. My boyfriend thinks she should pay and he is pretty mad about it because he paid for his own ticket so we are both out money. But also SIL is struggling and trying to take care of my nephew alone.", "created_utc": 1678121848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k4b98/aita_for_asking_sil_to_reimburse_me_for_concert/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No more helping out. No more benefits.  She was irresponsible.  There were consequences.  \n\nI know it sucks for her but this was super rude and she\u2019s acting very entitled.  She broke an agreement with you, violated your boundaries and didn\u2019t really seem to care because she expects you to just keep bending over for her. \n\nIf it was something that wasn\u2019t in her control (like the bus broke down) that would be one thing.  But the truth is she knew what she was doing.  You called her over and over and she didn\u2019t answer.  \n\nStop being her doormat.  Take your BF\u2019s side.  Don\u2019t involve your mom.

Being a widowed single mom is no excuse to abuse and misuse the people who are trying to help you.   \n\n\nIf this were me, I'd let the concert ticket fiasco go, because realistically, you'll never see that money.   BUT -  ***I'd never babysit for her again***.   She's proven she can't be trusted to show up on time or to answer her phone for her babysitter.", "NTA. Your sister deliberately abused your kindness by ignoring your calls and not returning on time. If she will not pay for the tickets, let her know you will not babysit again. Then stick to it.\n\nTell your mom that if she doesn\u2019t want your sister to pay for the tickets, she should cough up the money. Being a widow isn\u2019t a free pass to take advantage of others\u2019 kindness.", "NTA. At all. Why didn't your mother watch the kids so you didn't miss the show? And I agree with everyone else saying that your sil was super inconsiderate and that you'll no longer be available to babysit at a moment's notice; or at all. Let your mother do it.", "NTA. You won\u2019t get the money back, but I would consider it a kiss off gift to your entitled sister and go NC.", "NTA I don't think you will get the money back  but I don't think I'd be available for babysitting duties any time soon if she feels that entitled to be disrespectful of your time and plans.", "NTA. I get that she\u2019s struggling but it was really unfair of her to not keep better track of time. You did her a favor, you told her you had a hard stop time to leave, and she ignored it. That was disrespectful to you. I think requesting reimbursement was fair. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t like when parents don\u2019t answer their phones when I am watching their kids. My SIL does this all the time.", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing by helping watch your nephew. She didn't respect your time and made you miss something you were looking forward to.\n\nJust because she is a widow and mother does not mean she gets to ruin other peoples plans. Running errands is something you can do with a child. Is it easier to do it without them? Absolutely. But ruining someone's plans because you were too selfish to watch the time is an AH move.", "NTA.\n\nSucks for your sister, but this wasn't a doctor's appointment that went too long, or being stuck at work because the next shift didn't show.\n\nYou asked for reimbursement, she refused. I'd leave it there.   HOWEVER, she just lost her free babysitter, fool me once. I would no longer be her go-to free sitter.\n\nIf you were a paid babysitter, her ass would have showed up on time.  She doesn't see your time as having any value. She KNEW you had plans, but her alone time for errands was more important than keeping her word.  Again, sucks to be her, because now she will have to (likely hire) someone to have that free time.", "She can run errands with kids- people do it! \n\nShe\u2019s playing the widow card and using people.\n\nNTA at all! I\u2019d of told her off, I\u2019d of called someone to come get the kid. I\u2019d of taken the kid to the city and the concert. \n\nYou were kind and generous, but because of that you have to drop it.", "NTA I would stop babysitting. She used you after you told her you had to leave at a certain time. She didn\u2019t care.", "NTA. It was incredibly inconsiderate of her to be so late and to ignore your calls (!!). \n\nI don\u2019t think you can get your money back for your tickets, but I hope she got all her errands done for the next year or two, because it sounds like she\u2019s just lost a free babysitter for good.", "NTA \n\nI mean let go of the money but don't agree to babysit for quite a while.\n\nShe abused it and your mom can help out if she's so generous.", "NTA. \n\nYour SIL is in a terrible situation. But she might be milking it a little bit. What she did was thoughtless and selfish. And I'm pretty sure she knows that, and is using her status as a widow to justify her own bad acts", "OP, I am sorry for the loss of your brother. I am sorry you missed your concert. Whether you want reimbursement or not, don\u2019t count on getting paid for the tickets. \n\nSet up boundaries as she does not respect Your time. She stole your evening and your BF\u2019s too. I know she is suffering from grief, and maybe she was really running errands, but NOT ANSWERING THE PHONE when someone has charge of your kids\u2026.. BS bells are going off. At best she has a squeeze she is embarrassed to admit, at worst she has lost her mind and her Mom compass. \n\nOP, best wishes to you all.

Within context; your problem is petty compared to hers. She apologized, if she was more financially stable I\u2019d say it would be reasonable, but for the love of your family don\u2019t take money that she doesn\u2019t have to give.", "INFO: Why did you agree to watch your nephew when you already had plans that had the potential for conflict?", "Nta but your boyfriend could have went and gave your ticket to a friend or sold them at the concert so she doesn\u2019t owe him money.

If she can't afford it - maybe she can do services like clean or cook for you both? She sounds sincere in her apology so it would be really hard to hold it against her...", "NAH - It feels like it\u2019s just an unfortunate situation all the way around. Feels like you tried being helpful and she likely didn\u2019t have any malice. I feel for you and don\u2019t blame you for asking for reimbursement but probably also not worth harming your relationship with her for. Sorry you went through this", "No one is an asshole here.\n\nYour trouble is losing your date with your boyfriend and a concert you were excited about is bad.\n\nHer trouble is a need to work on 2 jobs to support and rise YOUR nephew after loosing her husband (your brother) is much worse.\n\nI get that you are mad at her not without a reason but your trouble and hers are on a completely different levels.\n\nI suggest you to make a pause for a certain time and try not to think about it for a time. And after that see how you feel about this situation. My assumption is that you may act right now based on your anger and not because you don't understand her situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can argue that it\u2019s still indirectly your SIL\u2019s fault, but it\u2019s too much of a gray area I think to say she owes him money. \n\nShe should reimburse you because she\u2019s directly responsible for you missing the show.", "NTA.
