SIL asked me to watch my nephew so she could run some errands. I agreed but I told her I had a train I needed to take and what time I needed her to be home by. That time came and went I called her multiple times with no answer. My train came and went. By the time she got home it would make no sense for me to go it would be over by the time I got there. My boyfriend was waiting for me in the city and never went in to the concert because he didn't want to go without me since I was so excited for it. Both tickets were wasted.\n\nWhen she got home she apologized and said she just has so many errands to run that she lost track of time. She said she never gets a chance to get things done because she works two jobs and she has a ton of things to get done. She once again said sorry and offered to cook me dinner I declined and went home. \n\nThe more I thought about it the angrier I got so the next day I texted her asking if she could reimburse me for the tickets. She replied that she simply didn't have the money and was struggling and once again she was very sorry. \n\nI asked my mom to say something to her but she won't. She asked me to just drop it because SIL is a window and has it hard enough and is struggling enough. She said is the worst thing in my life is missing a concert I am lucky and I have no idea how hard SIL has it. My boyfriend thinks she should pay and he is pretty mad about it because he paid for his own ticket so we are both out money.

Where and what your SIL where doing at that time, that made her not be able to answer your calls?\n2. Have this ever happened prior to this situation?\n3.

Just don't trust her in a time sensitive situation next time.", "If you\u2019re going to bring it up you need to be 100% certain you\u2019re going to stick to your guns and not give in later.", "OP, I would respond to her, \"The kind thing to do would be to repay me for my wasted tickets due to your actions. But if you're unwilling to do that, I'll make certain never to watch BLANK again, since I can't be sure whether you'll come back on time, or even if you'll answer your phone. I'm just not willing to risk it, since you've shown you don't care about my time or money, even when I'm doing you a favor.\"", "This 1,000%. I\u2019m a widowed from my husband (both male), and it was just less than 60 days ago. It isn\u2019t a free pass for me to shut out life. We had a dog together, luckily not kids, but I make sure she is taken care of and loved. I might be fatigued and depressed as shit, but I don\u2019t get a free pass\n\n\nALSO THIS BITCH WAS WIDOWED TWO GODDAMN YEARS AGO. CRY ME A RIVER YOU GODDAMN BITCH. \n\n(Grief is an ever changing, never ending process. It\u2019s more of how she uses it as an excuse. Her grief is valid, but not her neglecting her vital obligations. )\n\nI feel like she still cries from a melted popsicle from when she was 5, and that is why she has trouble \u201ctaking care of her kids\u201d. Totally unrelated things, but she is living in her own world.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss \ud83d\udda4", "Me too", "Tell mom and SIL, she could have asked you to babysit any other time but that day. You believed her and because you trusted her you took care if her child. Then you mussed the concert and stood up your boyfriend while your SIL knew that was happening.  Further, she made herself unavailable. Had their been an emergency, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach her.  What parent risks that.  \n\nSo going forward you will never trust her again.  Tell mom that she, mom, can take care of the widow because you are done.\n\nI\u2019m thinking she was meeting someone which was why she didn\u2019t want to be disturbed and didn\u2019t want to wait for you to be free.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t no offer to watch kids again - and do not hesitate to tell people why when asked.\n\nAlso, SIL prob went to a concert\u2026", "NTA. She knew she was late and made it worse by ignoring her phone. And what if something had happened to her child ??\n\nShe owes you the money. And sounds like she's going to need to find a new babysitter.", "Nta, I don't believe her that she lost track of time.  I think she just wanted to drop her burden onto you, which you weren't responsible for.  Good luck getting the money bc she won't pay, but you're not wrong here.", "You can\u2019t pay someone back if you have no money.\n\nI would suggest lessening the amount of favors you do her.", "NTA. nah, make her pay you back. she KNEW you were waiting and took extra long just because she could. get your money back!", "NTA.  Don't hold your breath waiting for her to repay you.  Never babysit for her again", "NTA. Give up on the money though. Youll lose more than concert tickets over that.", "I know it sucks but life sometimes sucks. Don\u2019t let this ruin your relationship. Let your sil make dinner for you and your boyfriend and let it go. This will not be your last disappointment I promise you. Continue to help with the baby but not when you have plans. Just no!", "NTA but honestly if she can't afford it I would just let it go she's struggling enough just don't do anymore favors for her in the future I would be upset too if I was in your position I would just let her know that the situation upset you and leave that", "Also forget the concert tickets ..what if something had happened to the nephew? How can she not pick up calls from someone who's watching her kids?\n\nYeah like no babysitting in the future\nNTA", "Understandable to lose track of time when out, but I bet you don't ignore phone calls from the person carrying for your child.  Her selfishness was disrespectful to OP's time and her own child if there had been an emergency.", "Also if something were to happen to the child you clearly would be unable to reach her.", "I don\u2019t think her problem is grief, it\u2019s lack of funds.", "Im sorry but, No. That's called lack of respect. \n\nShe obviously had the funds to \"run errands\" for hours while she was ignoring OP, *knowing* OP already had plans elsewhere. Knowing OP already had plans elsewhere, *WHILE* OP is doing her a favor.... \n\nThats 100% pure damn entitlement. Grief is valid but theres plenty of single moms out there, a whole damn bunch with living fathers not doin a thing to help just as single as the grieving ones as well while this woman caused OP to not only miss the concert but refuses to reimburse them for the money they completely wasted while she was off doin who knows what. \n\nThat shit was intentional\n\n& why the hell cant she run her errands *WITH* her kid like millions of people everywhere?? She was enjoying her free time & didnt care to sabotage OPs concert/date. If she actually appreciated the help, she would have came back when she said she would & either A. Took the kid with her for the rest of whatever she needed to do or B. Set up a time that was convenient for OP to finish the rest of the errands she sposedly cant do with her kid \n\nShe ignored *multiple* phone calls from the person who was caring for her child?? I'm not buying the \"Lost track of time\" garbage one bit. At the *VERY* least she owes for the tickets \n\nThat shit was intentional", "Definitely is a consideration. Probably somewhere inbetween", "NTA. Ask her to pay it back on small instalments. She gets a consequence without undo financial hardship.", "NTA. And I\u2019d never babysit again if it was me.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister does not value your time or money. Her hardships do not give her permission to take advantage of you and get a free pass by just saying sorry.\n\nI agree with the others who\u2019ve said you should put a stop to babysitting until you\u2019ve been paid back, but more than likely, this lesson about your sister\u2019s character is the price of those tickets.", "NTA to want to be reimbursed for your ticket. \n\nYour boyfriend's ticket is his own stupidity though, he had the chance to use it and that he didn't want to go without you was his decision.", "NTA", "NTA stop helping her. If she mentions anything simply tell her that you don\u2019t have the money or time to spare on her since you are making up what she lost you on tickets.", "Nta but just drop it. In retrospect would you agree that maybe you should have declined babysitting, if you had things to do. Set a hard boundary and move on. It will be a lot better in the long run", "NTA your SIL knew exactly what she was doing and deliberately made you miss the concert. She refused to answer her phone because all she cares about is herself. I\u2019d stop helping her out all together.", "NTA Agreeing with everyone saying she has a choice to pay back the tickets or you never watch your nephew again. I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t answer your calls! The only concession I might give would be to offer a payment plan if she can\u2019t give you the whole amount up front. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Don\u2019t take advantage of others kindness.", "I wouldn\u2019t blame OP for going to her mom. Her mom *should\u2019ve* been on OP\u2019s side and told SIL that what she did was unacceptable and that she needs to pay OP the money back. Her mom is an AH for not siding with OP.", "I\u2019d say don\u2019t agree to babysit ever again.", "Misery loves company.  SIL had no intention of sitting home with a kid while op enjoyed a concert with her boyfriend.", "Yea! I mean it was a huge dick move for her to force OP to waste the tickets. But like, wouldn\u2019t she want to know if OP had to call the ambulance cause the kid was having some sort of medical emergency? That was always my biggest fear when I was babysitting; that something would happen and I wouldn\u2019t be able to get ahold of the parent for some reason. I can\u2019t imagine the parent actively ignoring their phone while their kid is under someone else\u2019s care. It\u2019s crazy irresponsible.", "I don't think it was intentional??? Like, totally agree she's the AH but i wouldn't automatically think the worse. My theory would be that she miscalculated her time, got stuck in some place, realized she wasn't going to get back on time and ghosted OP because she didn't want to confront the situation. Still totally an AH move, but not cartoon-villain like evil.\n\nStill, she should have offered to pay for the tickets. If she can't pay the right now or in a single exhibition, she could compromise somehow.", "NTA. Widowed or not don\u2019t ever do her any favours again. She knew you had plans and still you decided to help her out because you know she\u2019s already struggling, you specifically told her a time she should be back and what did she do? She completely took advantage of your kindness, ignored you, didn\u2019t even bother checking her phone or answering any calls. Tell her to pay for your tickets, your poor boyfriend was waiting in the city all alone for you to get there. If your mom doesn\u2019t agree to let SIL pay then tell your mom to give you the money she uses to financially help your SIL with to make up for the money you and your boyfriend wasted for those tickets.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t sit for her if you have plans later. She took advantage", "NTA", "It sounds like she's started dating & used your babysitting to go on a date & that's why she didn't answer your calls & is being vague about what she was doing.", "So how many years is she going to ride the my husband died train? NTA", "NTA and tell her she can pay you back in instalments. You did her a favour, she shouldn\u2019t have taken advantage for it.", "Info: Did you agree on a time when she needs to be home before she left? Because it sounds like you didn't tell her about the concert until the next day. I also understand it like this, that you only asked for a time after she left.", "Your sister is a window..?", "NTA. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019re ever going to get your money back, but NEVER let her forget it. \n\nSIL \u201ccan you watch child at this time for an hour please?\u201d\nOP \u201csorry no can do, I\u2019ve got plans 12 hours later and I can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll be back on time\u201d.", "\"not returning on time\". Was the time set up before she left?", "Yep, this.\nA slightly different take on the money issue is that whatever the outcome, you\u2019d spent it regardless.  Obviously \u2018ideally\u2019 you\u2019d have been to the concert and had a great time, but the real issue is that you missed it and had a shitty time instead.  So the reason for being angry with sis is that you missed the concert, not that you lost the cash.  A slightly different take?\nNo more babysitting, anyway.", "I would do this much more passive aggressively. I imagine OP still wants to have a good relationship with SIL and the child. I would just drop the issue and in the future be much more selective about babysitting.  It sounds like OP enjoys babysitting and being a big part of the kids life. I doubt she wants to tell SIL she is never babysitting again..", "To what end? More drama? OP already knows they were being taken advantage of, and it's not like getting called on the lie will lead to an epiphany.", "What parent doesn\u2019t answer the phone when the person looking after their children is calling them? Their name pops up on your phone, you answer it straight away, no matter how important the job/appointment is. You have zero clue if your child has had an accident or an allergic reaction, etc. She definitely had some intention of not being back on time.", "I ignore phone calls all the time at work and at school, but I reach out when is an emergency/something important. How? Well, I can read the messages. When someone ignores a call and is something important, you usually send a message with something along the lines of \"hey, pick up, is important.\"\n\nIf is not important, I just ignore the calls.\n\nIf OP send a text saying something like \"hey, are you coming back soon?\" she probably knew what it was about\u2014not a life treating emergency.\n\nAnd, again, totally an AH move, but not an \"I explicitly wanna make OP unhappy\" situation.\n\nEdit: Also, I don't think a single mom that has a pretty limited support system would ruin things with her main baby sitter intentionally just because she was, idk, feeling particularly salty. I'm gonna say it again, because people on the internet find amazing ways to twist your words: I think she is the AH, but I don't think she plotted ruining OP's concert.", "How is it not an \u201cexplicitly wanna make OP unhappy\u201d? She knew that OP could only babysit for a certain amount of time and that she had plans that she was excited for. You\u2019d have to be completely self absorbed to believe that being so late that they would miss out on their plans would not make them unhappy.\n\nCalls = something important that they need an answer to straight away. Texts = non urgent. Don\u2019t need a reply ASAP.  Either way, if someone is looking after YOUR child, you answer straight away. I would point blank refuse to look after someone\u2019s child if I am never able to get ahold of the parents (only exception is if I know they are working in a rural area with no signal, they\u2019ve let me know that I will be unable to get ahold of them but give me other emergency contacts or they\u2019ve lost/broke their phone). Refusing to answer calls for hours on end, knowing the person caring for your child has prior commitments is 100% intentional and selfish.", "Oo I would be fuming.. It's not like u couldn't watch him another time so she could finish the errands another day. This is something that was worked hard for and been waited on for quite awhile. Something u cannot get back.\nI get loosing someone and I get struggling raising a child alone.. But that's no excuse to take advantage of someone who is doing u a favour and ruining their chance at fulfilling a desire they had..\nHad there been an emergency, I would understand that. Cannot help that if something happened preventing her from getting back.\n\nU do not ask someone for a favor and then change the length of time after the fact! I am so sorry that happened.. That's so sad.\n\nNTA although Idk if you'll get it back anytime soon.. Can only ask tho. No more free baby sitting and never b4 u have plans either!", "Just tell her that if she doesn\u2019t pay you , you won\u2019t help her anyway. And I think you should stop to help her , she is taking advance if you . NTA", "You're not really TA and I sort of understand what your SIL is going through. I don't think she abused your kindness in contrary to some comments here. Let's not jump into conclusions that will consequently upset you.\n\nA widow/widower with two kids won't get their sh** together for a while. It's not your problem of course but that's how life is. Life just keeps throwing you curveballs. I think she honestly forgot or was really busy.\n\nWhat you'll do next will depend on what type of family do you have. Some families value their bond/closeness and will keep it intact no matter what. The type that will sacrifice a lot of things. I'm not going to tell you what to do. If I were in your shoes though, I'll drop it. My family is the most important to me. I'll tell my SIL though that what she did is not nice and that my time is important too. But I won't ask her to reimburse me. I'll just forget about it.", "I don't believe she lost track of time or left you hanging maliciously (unless she's done this before). I do think she's probably stressed out of her mind. Working two jobs and taking care of a young child is a LOT. Plus having lost your partner, best friend and other half. I'm sure she DID take advantage of you - she probably felt like she wouldn't get another opportunity to have alone time. Maybe she went to a movie and didn't check her phone. Maybe she sat in her car crying until she put her head back and accidentally fell asleep. We don't know for sure. \n\nI think it would be really compassionate of you to not bug her for money over this and to give her some grace because it doesn't sound like it was from a malicious place. But I understand your frustration/anger about losing your own money, which is totally justified. You could say you'll never babysit again. Or, you could babysit, but not when you know you have plans later. Or agree to watch the child at mom's, knowing that you can leave when you need too. \n\nThe right thing for SIL to do would be to replace the tickets. I don't know her financial situation, but if it's really so bad that she can't afford it, would you want her and nephew to skip meals to pay you back? It's a lose-lose situation here. Yes, SIL is absolutely TA for losing track of time and not being responsive, no matter what the reason. But if this is the first time something like this has ever happened, don't blow up your relationship over a couple of concert tickets. I had a horrible couple of years when my dad and sister died. I can't imagine going through life as a widow and seeing a daily reminder in my son of the man I lost and the father my son will never have."]}
