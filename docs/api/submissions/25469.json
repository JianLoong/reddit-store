She applied for Psychology. The exam was pretty diffiulcult, because this year was the first year the exam included questions of critical thinking. This is where things get messy.\nMy gf found out that she can get extra time because of her bad sight. She has high myopia (aka she is very nearsighted) of around -7 in her worse eye. On top of that she has something known as anisometropia which means there is a big difference between her eyes' power (her better eye is at -4.50). Without her contacts there is very little that she can do, but with them she has 20/20 vision. \nNow back to the story. Because of these issues she applied and was given 2 extra hours on the exam, which lasted 2h for the other candidats. Given that she had 4h in total, she was admitted. In my opinion what she did is borderline cheating, at least on a moral level. What bothers me most is that she says she is actually bothered by her eyes (dizziness, eye fatigue), but somehow she never had any issues before knowing she could get extra time. I am nearsighted myself (admitedlly not as much as her, I'm in the -1 range) and never thought this would be grounds for extra time, as I never felt impaired in any way as long as I had my contacts. We fought about this multiple times, and it always culminated with me apologising and admitting that it was not about me, and that I should believe that her issues are real. I know I was the asshole because I made her feel bad. I accept my mistake, which was making her feel unsupported and invalidated. But at the same time I can't help it but feel my blood boil every time I realise what she did to get in the college of her dreams. I tried to just get over this, but I guess something is changed in the way I see her now.\nAm I in the wrong for feeling this way? Am I just an insensitive jerk? Or was this truly unfair for the rest of the candidates?\n\nEdit: Did I use \"blood boil\" wrongly? English is not my first language. What I meant was that I was hard to just move on and get over it.

Accommodations are pretty carefully allocated - the point is to make up for the disadvantage caused by a person\u2019s disability.  I\u2019ve gone from -1 to -4.5 over the last couple decades, and the difference is enormous.  My last set of glasses, I waited longer than I should have between getting new prescriptions, and I spent weeks misjudging distances and having dreadful headaches while I adjusted to the new lenses.  And that\u2019s with my eyes staying less than half a diopter apart in terms of prescription needed.\n\nYour gf probably never complained for the same reason lots of disabled people don\u2019t complain about issues they live with due to their disability - it can\u2019t really be helped or changed, and able-bodied people tend to be dismissive at best when you talk about it.  Sometimes they go so far as to get angry, especially if you talk about needing accommodations due to your disability\u2026like you did.", "YTA.\n\nI didn't read anything that indicates she was deceitful or lied. Did I miss something?", "YTA because why on earth would you give a shit about this even slightly?  Enough to fight about this multiple times and to the point your blood boils... good grief, you should seek some therapy.  A college has a program for people who qualify.... she literally qualifies, and you go nuts and argue and berate her and your blood still boils... because she qualifies for a program that is offered...\n\nYou should get some help, this is nutty.", ">Given that she had 4h in total, she was admitted.\n\nOr maybe because she's an intelligent woman who truly deserved admission? YTA, big time.", "YTA \n\nIf your blood boils and you\u2019ve had repeated arguments about something like this then look into anger management classes because your response is disproportionate", "YTA and why do you care what accommodations someone with a disability receives?  If only you would be able to try to do something that requires high levels of concentration while having very poor eyesight (and no, -1 is *not* very poor eyesight) for any length of time, you'd understand how difficult it is, and how stress can make it worse.  Giving someone like that more time is actually *more fair*, because people without her disability don't have to worry about that **and** the test at the same time, meaning it should be easier for them to do well.\n\nThe fact you are letting something like her disability make your blood boil says everything about you, unfortunately for you.  Life isn't fair, and that cuts both ways - she lives with a disability that would give a normal person a very hard time and doesn't complain, and you get mad because someone is accommodating that in what seems to be a pretty fair manner.  Get this into your head now, while you're still young - life isn't fair, and giving someone with a genuine disability a leg up is making that life *more* fair, not less.  If you can't see that, please step back from the chalkboard because you're standing too close to read what's on it.", "YTA\n\nBad vision comes in a variety of flavors, and her flavor happens to include dizziness and eye fatigue. That warrants having extra time. Her receiving this has nothing to do with you and is none of your business.\n\nYou need to learn to not get angry about people having academic accommodations. There are enough ableist jerks out in the world already who actively work to deny them.", "YTA.  Your girlfriend must have been required to provide medical evidence of her eye sight with her application for a testing accommodation.  Based on her medical records, and only based on them, the testing agency decided whether or not she deserved additional time. You have no business second guessing her asking for an accommodation; nor for that matter, does the fact that she was granted an accommodation a matter of cheating.  It's a matter of trying to provide some fairness in the testing.\n\nAlso, even though some people have learned to adapt to everyday life with a condition, it does not mean that they can handle the added stress of trying to function within unfamiliar and/or high stakes settings. So she may act okay with you; but you're not in her shoes when she's taking a test.", "YTA. I mean, you know she struggles with dizziness and fatigue but you still think that using the extra time is morally unacceptable. If this makes your blood boil, you're going to have a real hard time in this life. The world is full of little injustices like this.", "YTA she was awarded it based on her diagnoses dr eejit", "YTA, if the school decided this and she didn't fake her diagnosis I don't see how it's cheating and why it bothers you. She was well within her rights to ask for the extra time. Just because she didn't voice any issues before, does not mean she didn't have them. Some people don't like to complain as not to stand out or have others make fun of them. \n\nIn some countries, it's hard to even get a driver's licence with such issues, so I'm happy to hear they get some help in other ways. \n\nThe fact that she mentions her issues now, means progress, mean she feels validated and can safely express without fear. I know many people with even worse eyesight and they usualy don't talk about it because honestly non of us really understand what it's like for them. One friend didn't get to see the stars on the night sky only when he was around 30 and found the right contacts for his issues.\n\nMaybe she would have aced it even in two hours, but why live life on \"hard mode\", when there is help. It might just be some competitiveness from your end, but do you really think she does not deserve a spot in that college?", "-7? Damn, my -11 self could probably have gotten extra time when I was at school/college!\n\nYTA. The school knows that she would be wearing glasses/contact lenses, but still allows the extra time, therefore she did nothing wrong. Also, 4 hours is meaningless if you don't know what to write; she got in on her own merit.", "YTA  \n\n\nThat's a nasty, bitter and cynical reaction to her getting a pass. Ask yourself why you've reacted so negatively and address it.   \n\n\nAfter you've apologised.", "YTA\n\nStay in your lane.", "YTA. -1.0 isn't even in the ballpark of being -7. Without your glasses, you aren't legally blind. But your gf is without her contacts. \n\nYou don't know what it is like to live in her shoes. Stop being jealous and petty.", "Yta- I hope she dumps you so that way you can post about it later.", "Its pretty easy to get any diagnosis that give you extra time on exam. There are over thousands of them you prob have some without knowing. Check the list of acceptable diagnosis for extra time on exams. Bad vision is on that list.", "YTA.\n\nIf she gets dizziness and eye fatigue, then those issues would almost certainly be agitated by the stress of an exam and staring intently at an exam paper. Her diagnoses allow the extra time and she took it.\n\nShe was not at all deceitful and I don't think it's any of your business what accommodations she does or doesn't need.\n\nComparing your eyesight to hers would be like me saying my vision is -0.25 and I don't need glasses at all so you are lying about needing glasses. They are vastly different prescriptions with different effects on eyesight and related symptoms! -1 does not remotely compare to -7/-4.5.\n\n\n\nEdit to add: \"blood boil\" means to be completely enraged. Almost the most angry one can be.", "Yta she follow the rules to have extra time. All was legal.", "YTA. This does not affect you in any way so why are you going on about this? You are acting like they are taking time away from you to give to her. You have no idea what it is like for her, count yourself lucky for that.", "So the school doesn't think it's cheating but you on your high horse do? \n\nHave you studied the requirements to get the time extension? Were you part of the group that decides how the extensions are handed out. \n\nYou know why time extensions aren't actually that big of deal to most but do tend to help people with disabilities? Giving people more time generally doesn't help them, they either know the answers or they don't. Giving two extra hours to sit there and ponder will not help most of the time. But two extra hours to someone that truly has trouble with a physical aspect of the test and not the knowledge aspect will help immensely.\n\nPeople shouldn't be punished because they can't process the test as fast as others. Whether that be from dyslexia trouble with eye sight or anything else.\n\nHer prescription is 7x stronger than yours. So comparing your eyes to hers is ridiculous.\n\nYTA", "Yta- why are you so upset your gf was given more time for a legitimate reason? Major ah", "YTA. You don\u2019t just apply for consideration, you generally have to get a letter from your doctor or optometrist to support the request.  You sound incredibly knowledgeable about what her condition is without realising how debilitating those issues can be.", "I have exactly the same condition, including anisometropia and have never heard of anyone who has perfect corrected vision claiming this. I work with students with learning problems and disabilities. What your gf has is an accommodation (focus) problem which is easily corrected. It is not a visual impairment and it is not a specific learning disability (dyslexia, dyscalculia). In our country what she did is called pochle and well played.", "YTA- the other comments takes the words right out of my mouth for the reasons to why your TA. I think it's nice that you realise some of the mistakes you wrong tho, keep it up.", "YTA. She didn't mention her problems to you because she didn't think anything could be done to help, and had always assumed she'd just have to soldier on at a disadvantage. She also didn't mention them because they're normal to her - and that doesn't mean they aren't a problem; just that she takes the problem for granted because it's always there, like being asked to put on a second pair of shoes every day.\n\nWhen she found out there was help available, she reached out and asked for that help. That's exactly what people with disabilities are supposed to do. The help is available for good reason.\n\nAnd let's be clear here: she isn't using that extra time to gain advantage in the exam. It's there to level her up to a point of equality with everyone else by allowing her to manage her symptoms. She can now afford to take some time out in the middle of the exam to close her eyes and recover from the dizziness and eye fatigue, before going back to the question. Or she can use the extra time to compensate for the fuzziness of thought that comes with feeling sick and dizzy all the time.", "YTA you\u2019re jealous and scapegoating superior morals.", "YTA. While it is unfair to other candidates, who cares when it benefits you.", "I have myopia and astigmatism. My worst eye is -4.50. Contacts do not fix my vision to 20/20. It's a huge improvement because I'd be legally blind without them...but it's nowhere near what a person with naturally 20/20 has. \n\nMy eyes get fatigued easily. I have very poor night/ low light vision. My eyes dry out constantly. I need regular breaks from reading because my eyes feel like sand paper. I can only imagine what -7 is like. \n\nIs she deserving of the extra time? I can't say. But you *are* minimising her vision issues because at -1, you don't actually know.", "NTA, if her vision is correctable to 20/20, she has NO grounds for a test accommodation.  She's just gaming the system and is a bit of a sleaze. My vision is that bad and I'd never even think of asking for a time accommodation. Because I'd be prepared to take the test legit.", "Your vision means it's a bit harder to see things a bit further away. Your gf's vision means that if she doesn't know where her glasses or contacts are, she probably can't see to find them again. Don't be comparing the two of you, it's not the same.\n\nIf she is eligible for extra time, because of the disadvantage she is already working with, why wouldn't you want her to have that?\n\nThe problem with accommodations like this, is that people see it as an advantage that is putting someone ahead of them, not support that is bringing them from a harder position to the same place.\n\nBe pleased that she has the opportunity to excel, don't put her down.\n\nYta.", "YTA\n\nShe might be near sighted, but you're short sighted.", "YTA. Your gf has enough obstacles in her life due to poor eyesight, there is nothing immoral about using available accommodation. \n\nBesides, there are medical issues you would never actually even think that these things can be related to a poor eyesight. For example, I have similar eyesight as your gf and also have O neg blood type, perfect for donation. But I am not allowed to donate due to eyesight, because apparently it might worsen my health.", "YTA. Your vision is nothing like hers, the fact that you tried to say that you don't have issues so she can't have issues is goofy. \n\nHer eyes are way worse and she has two vastly different prescriptions for each eye. I also doubt her vision is even corrected to 20/20. When you have prescriptions like that, the doctors usually can't correct you to 20/20, it's too drastic for your eyes and brain to reconcile.", "YTA for 2 reason\n\n1 - Accomodations are not handed out willy nilly, if she qualified then she qualified. You are obviously not an education professional so your opinion is invalid.\n\n2 - If she is your girlfriend, you're supposed to be on the same team. If you are going to begrudge someone on your team for finding an advantage in life, you are not a good teammate\n\nin conclusion, you're young and you won't be together much longer. I'd take both of the above points to heart though, they will serve you well in life. (tl;dr stay in your lane, support your team)", "NTA - If the \"drawback\" is compensated with a disproportionately increase in time ( 2x ) then she has an unfair advantage.", "Hmmmmm INFO: Even though your gf has never told you she has dizziness and eye fatigue issues before the test, has she ever showed that she could have that type of problem? If not then I\u2019d probably say that you\u2019re not TA since even though it\u2019s not *technically* cheating, it\u2019s still morally questionable to use blurry vision (which is corrected by contacts, so really 20/20) to get double time on the test. However if she has shown symptoms of these two issues then yeah, you\u2019d be TA.", "Eh, I'm going to go with ESH because it honestly does sound like she took advantage of the college's accommodations even if they did approve them. I say this as someone who is a -7/-5.25 with astigmatism. With my contacts I see perfectly fine with no issues throughout the day. So unless she has some other sort of vision issue that you failed to mention, it does sound like she just wanted to get extra time by any means possible. That aside, it's really none of your business and doesn't personally affect you.", "NAH. In the US, a lot of upper class people go to certain doctors who will rubber stamp requests for accommodations due to very minor reasons to help their students to better in school and on admissions tests. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly unfair. However, without access to medical records, I can\u2019t say if she\u2019s being deceitful or she\u2019s genuinely at a major disadvantage.", "Since no one seems to have  said anything about it, yes. You used \"makes my blood boil\" correctly, although it might be a bit much given the circumstances.\n\nThe way I see your situation, she's doing what she can to make her dreams come true and not hurting anyone to get there.\n\nIt seems to me like you're actually jealous that she can get some extra time in exams because of the severity of her eye condition.\n\nJust sit down with her, talk about how cool it is that she's taking the steps to achieve her dream and sweep the jealousy aside. It won't get you anywhere.\n\nGonna say YTA but this is a situation you should learn from.", "YTA but I can also kinda see how that would be annoying to someone else.\n\nOn a separate note I\u2019m gonna check if I can get any accommodations at my school since my prescription is -11,-10 and my glasses are the highest level prescription my doctor can give me. I still have to squint to see sometimes with my glasses.", "YTA she rightfully used an accommodation for her disability and you got angry for it.", "YTA who the hell are you to judge what\u2019s a disability? She applied for extra time and it was approved. That\u2019s all that matters. Your opinion is irrelevant and you\u2019re being an AH to your GF.", "YTA. I have some similar eye conditions. Although my vision is corrected, sometimes things are out of focus, and I have to actively concentrate to bring them in focus. It does add time to reading activities.\n\nIn general, don't judge anyone with a disability you don't have. You might think you know what they're dealing with, and they might appear to function completely normally, but they might be handling a dozen extra challenges that are invisible to you.\n\nHaving extra time on the test isn't going to give her any answers she didn't already know. The time limit on the test doesn't exist to see if students can do high-speed psychology. It is likely set to the amount of time a normal person would reasonably be expected to need and only exists to prevent the people administering the test from having to wait indefinitely for stragglers. Giving a disabled student extra time is analogous to a wheelchair ramp; it costs the college slightly more to provide and makes the playing field for disabled students closer to level. It doesn't give them an advantage.", "YTA As some with severe sight impairment that is categorized as blind, (4% vision in one eye and can\u2019t see more than 12-15 inches in front of my face) sight loss can cause such a multitude of other issues and often it\u2019s hard to explain to people who don\u2019t have it because it varies on a lot of external factors like heat, tiredness, stress, overhead lighting, even the font or color of the paper can make it more difficult.  Accommodations are also not easily handed out and given, they require documented medical proof that\u2019s evaluated. Also you would be surprised by the number of people with sight impairment who learn to adapt to fit into a sight driven world out of sheer necessity and they don\u2019t complain because no one wants to be judged or mocked for a disability.", "A lot of people with disabilities make their own accommodations, because it\u2019s easier than asking for help and sometimes they don\u2019t realize how much extra work they\u2019re doing to have the same experience. There is also typically a cap on how much these self imposed modifications can help, so interventions often aren\u2019t requested until they are facing something extraordinarily difficult. \n\nWhy should she have to suffer through the mental drain of headaches, eye pain, and eye fatigue, when she can be given enough time to rest her eyes so she can focus on the test, not accommodating her disability? YTA", "Wow YTA\n\nJust be happy she got in", "YTA\n\nAsk yrself where the harm is? \n\nDid she hurt anyone by requesting and using extra time? Was this option not available to everyone who struggles with any impairment wether or not it seems justified or not to outsiders? \n\nAre you jealous because you feel she got an \u201cunderserved advantage\u201d? How does this specifically affect you? You weren\u2019t taking the same tests at that time, were you? And if you were how does her getting extra time affect your own ability to take the exam and do your personal best on it?\n\nAre you looking for a reason to be upset or fight? Does this issue really matter in terms of yr everyday life? Or maybe you just want to feel morally superior?\n\nMost people have slightly different views on morality. No two people see the same situation as exactly the same when speaking of ethics and morals. You have to remember that all morality is just a set of agreed upon rules. You obviously have a rule about not getting help or advantages unless you absolutely \u201cneed\u201d it, which is fine for you. It\u2019s not fine to judge someone else\u2019s need. Nor to judge someone else for using the help offered. There are already systems put in place to determine need, and as far as you describe she followed that system and did not lie to gain an underserved advantage. She was offered additional time and she accepted that offer. She did not just randomly decide that she could take as long as she wanted the exam, she didn\u2019t decide what disabilities qualify for accommodation, she didn\u2019t take advantage of a loophole or help that would be unavailable to anyone else.", "YTA. You can't even begin to understand the difference in your vision circumstances. You're in the -1 range. Which means that yeah things at a distance are blurry, but you can likely still recognize people and objects. If you don't have your glasses or contacts on, you can still see to drive. I'm -5.25 in both eyes. If I take my glasses/contacts off, I can't even see my computer screen at work less than a foot in front of me. Your vision issues probably AREN'T grounds for extra time. Hers are significantly worse, and her eyes are different vision diopters. Don't compare things which you have no clue about.", "-1?

I feel like you handled the situation well and didn't really even need to make this post in the first place.", "So she has diagnosed issues with her eyesight. That have been proven to cause issues like eye strain/fatigue. She has probably dealt with both most of her life and just gotten so used to expecting it she doesn\u2019t say anything.

So what is the harm?", "She made the administration aware of her visual impairment and asked for extra time, which was granted. I assume she had to show some sort of documentation. I appreciate that her contacts bring her up to 20/20 but eye strain and fatigue are real. Some times people with disabilities do not want to ask for considerations but recognize that not doing so might have negative consequences. She might be able to manage a one-hour test but recognize that a three-hour exam will be too much for her eyes.\n\nGotta go with YTA here.
