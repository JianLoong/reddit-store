That's $1500 in 1990.\n\nJanuary 10th, one of my Uncles died. I didn't care much for him and disliked my Aunt tremendously! She was SUCH a flaming narcissistic bitch! However, even though I wasn't close to my Uncle and couldn't stand breathing air within 10 miles of my Aunt, we moved our WEDDING DAY to February 10th.\n\nWhy? Because my niece and nephew were grieving the loss of their father. My other Aunts and Uncles were grieving, my grandparents were grieving, my father was grieving. \n\nIt wasn't about my wife and I. Neither my wife or I considered NOT moving our wedding date for ONE second even though it was another $1500 to reschedule everything. From invitations to rentals to flowers to venue to others travel plans, $1500 didn't cover others expenses but you know what?  Not a single friend or family member had an issue with the changes. \n\nAnd here you are all focused on the damned engagement party? \n\nMy wife and I consulted with our family and everyone was good with us having the wedding on this date.

My dad tried hard to contact everyone to cancel the party.  This was before cell phones so group texts were not a thing.

I don\u2019t understand why OP wants to be a glutton for punishment. The reality is that if the current date is kept, many guests will either not come at all, drop in quickly to be polite and then leave \u2014 or stay out of a sense of obligation, but be miserable the whole time. Both the family\u2019s grieving and the engagement celebration will be compromised. I strongly suspect that OP will be incredibly butt hurt when this engagement party turns out to be a total flop.", "And if they don\u2019t want to cancel totally, there is a date available in April - for god\u2019s sake, that\u2019s not far away.

I can bet most of your family won't attend the party if you leave, or show up grieving. Which is fun! Right? They'll cheer right up!

So thoughtful!\n\nSeriously, learn some empathy...", "I agree with you.", "Are engagement parties really a thing? We didn\u2019t have one when we got married. I\u2019ve never even been to one.

You haven't lived until you've pregamed a funeral.", "We have wakes after the funeral... that's not the same as an engagement party.  And her response was very callous.

It\u2019s just an engagement party. Assuming she\u2019s in the US and wants to have all of the events that now exist for weddings, she has still got the bridal shower and bachelorette party. And no one is saying to cancel it - just postpone it, which the venue is able to accommodate.\n\nThis is not denial. This is selfishness. This is prioritizing a party over a lost life, and thinking that other people care so much about that party that it will make them forget about what happened for the day.", "It\u2019s almost as though it\u2019s not all about her grief.\n\nMaybe she wasn\u2019t close to her cousin.

I partied a couple days after my fiance died. Went and got drunk with a bunch of people, which was something I'd never really done before at that point. I also did the same when my cat that I'd had for 18 years died. Why? Because ot was a distraction. It allowed me to deny what I was feeling and not have to think about or acknowledge it too much. I could talk about them in both cases. Acknowledge they had died. I didn't think I was in denial either, but I absolutely was in a way. I said I had accepted his death, but I didn't really do that for a couple years after. I've also seen MANY others deal with grief in that way. Just party it away and try your best not to think about it. The happiest and funnest event will surely make you forget about the worst one, right? It doesn't, but it's nice to just ignore it all. It can absolutely appear as insensitive, though. I got told off for that myself back then.\n\nI'm unsure if this is what OP is going through, but yeah. This is a possibility.

She is an AH for not empathizing with her mother, and seeing her mother's perspective and then coming on Reddit. \n\nShe has had many chances to realize that she is being ah AH, but the moment people start bringing in 3rd party to question their own sense of morality in a situation, it's hard to blame denial. They are actively seeking input on whether or not they were an AH..", "Yeah I mean I guess 90 year old grandma is fairly chill about her high school classmates dropping, but a young adult dying that hits kinda different.", "A cancer diagnosis being revealed on the same day by a parent/immediate family member and then being asked to not go back to a game you were previously playing because you need or want emotional support from your own children, is a lot different from a cousin's death that occurred a week ago and being told to hold off on an engagement dinner (in Feb) until April, which is months away. If OPs mom doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to and she isn't being forced. But OP likely doesn't have the same relationship or closeness with her cousin as a lot of the others for whatever reason.", "I really want to know if this OP has rules for their wedding and what they are. I have a feeling they probably have some ridiculous ones.", "This was my thought. For a whole entire wedding? Yeah that could be kept, with the understanding that some people may change their RSVPs last minute.

She lost her whole family and her supposed friend is playing games with her grief!", "Imagine if we celebrated losing our virginity like that, announcements, party, including favors.", "I mean lots of people have said they've found comfort in family events after tragedy so its not that presumptuous or is it insulting.

It was developed based on the experience of individuals with terminal cancer and I hope anyone can understand how that\u2019s not very generalizable to the greater population. It was so, so important to the field of grief work because it was some of the first direct research. But there\u2019s so much more now. \n\nIt\u2019s also not something that we can apply to anyone else. This is also a reason it\u2019s problematic\u2014it can force people to feel guilt/shame over not feeling what they think they \u201cshould\u201d in their grief.

Actually, she also said in several extensive interviews before her own death that it was \u201ccomplete bullshit\u201d, (she was salty, and yes used those words), and that she wished she hadn\u2019t ever thought it up. She felt that the way the psychology community and everyone else just glommed on with little examination or understanding that grief presents differently for different people. The 7 stages concept was meant to be helpful, but not for everyone like some kind of psychological law.
