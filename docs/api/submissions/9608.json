Not a single friend or family member had an issue with the changes. \n\nAnd here you are all focused on the damned engagement party? \n\nMy wife and I consulted with our family and everyone was good with us having the wedding on this date.

But living on as normal is unfortunately a part of death.", "NTA Some people will be grieving too much and unable to attend. I am sure that you will understand.

That said, an engagement party is obviously different.", "They should honestly being sad together doesnt help shit.", "They\u2019re called wakes and they are not meant to be celebratory.", "Well I'm on the fence here. \n\nCoz my family(and its huge with 13 aunts and uncles) does funerals, but immediately after the burial is a hearty lunch and a bit of a party. We get together and all catch up, we tell stories of the person who passed and remember them fondly. \n\nWe don't put things off either. People still did their 18th and 21st and baby showers all in the month of one of my uncles passing, and everyone was glad to get together again. it wasn't as raised as it would have been, obviously conversation does drift to the recently deceased and remembering them again, but we still do the celebration for what's going on. \n\nWe don't put life on hold, i know not everyone does this, but the world doesn't stop, your grief doesn't have to stop you and the world won't stop for it either, you have to carry it with you til it's not such a burden anymore.. inevitably some grieve in private more than others, or let it out when we get together but we don't stop family from doing things either. That's stealing their moments too, that's their life, those deceased won't mind, they'd be there too if they could celebrating with everyone else. \n\nIf it was an engagement party, a birthday or a graduation whatever it was, out family would let the celebration or meal go on as normal and after the big hurrahs have been done and things settled down, we'd have an announcement for a moment of silence to remember the recently deceased, then back to the party. Typically it would be after a cake is cut and all the guffaws are done but before anyone feels their social obligations are done and they can leave and just before the next thing is due to start(think after desert at a dinner get together over coffee and before you lay the bill to head to the next venue/bar. You get the moment then are ushered on to the next thing) \n\nI know other families who just implode, it's just different for everyone. So I cant say OPs mom is the AH or OP. \n\nBut certainly the way they are communicating to eachother they are assholes. Nothing wrong with a nice calm rational conversation and hash it out.", "Yeah, the 9/11 ragers on 10/11 were the best ever.", "If the venue wouldn't allow rescheduling or the date would be in like 2 years I would have a little empathy for OP. The new date is 2 months from now. If the venue allows it, it's because SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO reschedule these things, for example, when a tragedy happens in their family.

Thank you. What is even the point beyond trying to get more gifts and attention from people? Such a non-event and frankly a waste of resources.
