None of this is ideal. Sometimes life throws you for an unexpected loop and you have to adjust. I don't mean that flippantly, either. It's REALLY hard when life forces us to change big plans. But it DOES happen.\n\n\n\nAlso, the timeline is a bit off. An engagement party is typically done soon after you get engaged. Yet you are also getting married in just two months? These are not typically back-to-back events. Are you getting it confused with a bridal shower?", "Don\u2019t expect too many cheerful people at your (blech anyway) engagement party. What an inconvenience for you that your cousin died.", "YTA\n\n\nYou are selfish. So I\u2019m going to explain you in a way you can understand the reason why not postponing is going to be a bad idea.\n\nLet\u2019s ignore the suffering, the basic human decency and all these are trivial things (/s). Do ypu think that a party where half of the guests are morning is going to be a great party? You are going to be remember ad the future bride who threw the worst engagement party ever.\n\n\n(Mighty god of thunder, I feel like a monster for using this kind of argument. But I have the feeling it's the only kind of thing you care about)", "NTA - while it is sad, something\u2019s take huge amounts of planning and time. I would say the family could use a positive event.", "NTA  when a high school friend of mine passed, they bussed us to his funeral. We said our goodbyes and still went to the regularly scheduled prom & graduation with tributes to him.", "Those are great questions. OP, this would be really good to know in order to make a judgement. Also to add: when is the funeral and when is the party? Are there some days in between?", "I was sure when I read about how the hassle of rearranging a party trumps the shared grief of their family.\n\nBut yeah, it's just the thing to help them all move on.", "I think my eyes fell out of my head there-seriously lose a loved one-have a party", "Many funerals do end with a luncheon. OP didn\u2019t phrase that well at all but the family events we did in the aftermath of burying a cousin at 25 this past summer truly did help many of us quite a bit in starting to dig out of that helplessness you feel when grieving.", "YTA.  With the accident being so close, if family feels obligated to attend I would be shocked if it wasn\u2019t a somber event.  Who would want a somber engagement party.  \n\nOP next week: all my family came and they were gloomy.  How dare they.", "I'm sure OP is bitter, because the death is taking focus away from her.", "No show or comming?", "This.\n\nIt's tough but a lot of your family are grieving the sudden loss of a loved person who died far too young. They will simply not be in any mood to celebrate your engagement right now. Is that the energy you want in an engagement party? Either half your family wont attend or they will literally look like someone just died. Bevause that is exactly what happened.\n\n\nIf you don't postpone, I think you will get a very different engagement party than you are hoping for. Nobody on your side is going to be hyped.\n\nPeople postpone things all the time, and engagement parties are relatively minor. Since you can postpone with the venue with no massive loss, it really seems like the best thing to do. This is just a minor party in the grand scheme of things - you wi ne just as engaged if you celebrate it in 2 months' time.", "This comment wins, a lot of good points", "This is what I was thinking.  If it was the wedding, I\u2019d totally get not moving it.  But it\u2019s a party.", "I kind of wish OP WOULD continue. I'd love for her to get the awful, deoressing funereal engagement party her lack of empathy deserves, with half the guests looking like someone just died....because they literally did. And the other half quickly finding out why the family are all inconsolable and why half of them didnt attend,  and realising how much of an asshole OP is. \n\n\nBut i dont really wish that would happen because it would be awful for the family.\n\nOP should be careful what they wish for, though. This party won't be the one she is hoping for...", "This is the most important part. If it\u2019s in a week, the party should wait. Also because I can tell OP, you will be so annoyed that your engagement party ended up being an improvised grief group for your cousin if you don\u2019t wait. Now if it\u2019s in a month or so\u2026Well maybe you don\u2019t have too but I would still be prepared for the party being a very sad one.", "It really depends on cultural background. For instance in Greece and Eastern Europe in general, a death in the immediate family would be cause to postpone for 6 months minimum. For a parent or sibling death, festivities are inconceivable within a year of the death. (The party, not the actual engagement or the wedding)", "I think most people (like me) are concluding that it's pretty soon, because OP highlights that April is too far away.", "I think OP means that a family and friends get together around a happier subject can, and for some people almost definitely will, help change the mood and start to heal. Grief is such an all consuming thing it can be hard to get out of that space. We buried my cousin at 25 over the summer and the happy distractions (an engagement and pregnancy announcement) were a very welcome and beneficial distraction that helped start to move towards whatever normalcy was now going to be after that tragedy. \n\nTL:DR - OP didn\u2019t phrase that well but, for me, what he said would absolutely be right.", "The self-absorption is strong with OP.", "This. If I lost a sibling or a child or a grandchild, or a niece or nephew  or even an aunt or uncle, no engagement party would make me feel better.", "This. I\u2019ve never understood the need for additional parties to celebrate a life change.\n\nWeddings- engagement party, bridal shower, bachelorette/bachelor party, then finally the wedding itself. At least nix the engagement party, it\u2019s just self serving.\n\nPregnancy - gender reveal AND baby shower. Pick one.  Not both. \n\nYTA\n\nFamily tragedy trumps party you don\u2019t need.", "Come on. This bridezilla isn't sharing her party spotlight to have a tribute to her dead cousin \ud83e\udd23", "Nothing selfish there, right?", "Then she shouldn't expect people to go.", "They're grieving the recent, sudden death of a child, a sibling, possibly even a parent. A party isn't going to be the magic elixir you think it is. Bereavement doesn't work like that.", "Because the death of a family member is the same as the death of a classmate\u2026", "Not even close to the same as losing a family  member. Also, teens are, by nature, on the self centered side, so going to prom checks that box", "I understand that, but I would imagine that her engagement party will be rather different.", "The party would really suck if they give ahead\nLol", "Exactly, soon could be 3 months, or 3 days. Context matters.", "It's to get around the \"selfish\" thing.  The tribute could be as big or small as they want.  It could literally be a toast.  Or even just a bunch of flowers in the corner with a photo.", "Big ass assumption - I said a positive event not magically fix things.", "Right? The quota for basic empathy and emotions is so low today that it's basically 3 floors underground.", "Some family members you just don\u2019t mourn like genuine people you find out in the world, so yeah empathy is for those who you personally feel deserve it. I should expect to have seen you crying outside Buckingham Palace because her majesty passed\u2026 she is your majesty the world must cease to function!!!!\u2026. that is the fallacy you present here. Life goes on. The dead get their funeral and life goes on.", "Just another reason why op is YTA", "Bridezilla wants all eyes on her. There will be no sadness, just awe and wonderment for the bride", "If anything, should the family attend (they won't, obviously) it will turn into a wake for the cousin.", "Why are you calling her Bridezilla? She doesn't sound like one.", "Right? Presumably a few people will drink too much and start crying, people will be reminiscing about the cousin, telling stories, raising toasts to him, it\u2019ll just be a wake. I don\u2019t know what universe OP lives in that she thinks this is going to be a celebration.", "She wants to have a party right after a young cousin died. She doesn't want to reschedule because she \"can't wait.\" That is a selfish, bridezilla move. It is all about her and what she wants"]}
