But you can't make her be more invested. You can document all this for 6 months then apply for full custody but if you are hoping for her to step up more,   it sounds like she doesn't care. Do you want the kids full time?", "NTA but honestly I would just take her back to court for full custody. She gets visitation, but when she doesn\u2019t show up at least the kids are in a consistent place. Date night is more important to her then her kids, ridiculous.", "Honestly, sounds like she doesn't want the kids so maybe you need to get full custody before the kids gets hurt mentally and emotionally by their mom's constant pushing her responsibility onto other people. Oh FYI, unless that grandmother is deathly sick, age doesn't determine someone's ability to watch kids. My grandmother and great aunt were both very old when they were watching me while my mom was at work and they did a wonderful job.", "NTA, neither of you are obligated to say yes to the other. But shes not asking cuz she needs help, shes asking cuz shes court mandated to ask. You can say no if you want, but then youre missing out on the time with your kids that was so important to you that you insisted this rule be included in your agreement. Kinda backwards, if you ask me\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. This is absolutely baffoonery. If i were you, i would gather proof of all this bullshit and then bring it to the courts and get a higher level of custody and have her pay child support. She clearly doesnt want to prioritize her children, they should be with someone who clearly puts them FIRST and has their best intentions at heart 100% of the time. Good luck to you mate, thank you for being a good father.", "NTA. Are you keeping evidence of all this in case you want to use it in a possible family court case? You can choose what you want to do but this very much sounds like something you should document in case you want to change custody arrangements.", "NTA\n\nStart tracking how often this is happening and her reasons. Also document when you ask her and she refuses (and her reason). It will give you the data to reopen the conversation about custody in the future. And that doesn't have to be you demanding full custody. It could just be you approaching her with \"look, over the past x months you've passed on time with the kids x times. Do we need to revisit the current arrangement?\"", "Nta but seems like her new bf doesn\u2019t want the kids around and you might as well have full custody, if you have them  most of the time during her time", "NTA. if there is a plan, then make her stick to it. its unfortunate that she is taking advantage of your love for the kids, but you would need to put your foot down.", "Not the a-hole at all. Co-parenting means it should be about 50-50. Seems like your ex wants the enjoyment of being single at your expense and clearly isn't putting the kids first.\n\nHaving kids that age means one must make sacrifices and it doesn't seem like you ex is prepared to do that.\n\nPut your foot down and say no or ask for full custody.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your ex is shirking her parenting duties.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously your ex would suck more than you, and clearly she's being unfair-- but parenthood means that you have to prioritize your kids' safety and wellbeing over concepts like fairness. \n\nIf this continues, you should talk to your attorney.

You say you co-parent 50/50, but it seems like that ratio doesn't add up. Deny to watch the kids, and you could potentially have full custody soon enough if she continues to let a geriatric \"babysit\" your kids.", "NTA, but you need to start documenting some of this stuff and pushing for full custody if you want. She sounds like an unfit mother", "NTA. There is a plan in place and both of you need to follow it. The kids are very young and they come first. If your ex isn't doing her bit or is being neglectful you need to get the plan revised. The safety of the kids is most important..", " NTA                \nCompromise with your ex-wife on whom you can both ask to babysit if the other parent is busy, whether it be a relative, friend or babysitting service, etc.,.", "NTA.

Your CO says you need to ask the other parent first of all, not that the other parent has to say yes everytime the other asks.\n\nThat being said, I don't get why people feel the need to put something like this in a CO. This is just making co-parenting harder for everybody involved. \n\nAlso, sounds like your ex doesn't enjoy being a mother these days, so maybe trying to change custody so that you can have the kids more would be something to consider...", "You can say no. It sounds like she's doing what the custody order says by asking,  not trying to take advantage.  You don't get to complain about the babysitting arrangements she makes. Age is not the defining factor in whether grandmother can care for the kids; I know 80 year Olds who would be more than fine and 50 year olds who wouldn't.  NAH, just say no and then mind your own businesses unless there's an actual risk to the kids.", "YOU ARE THE AH BC YOURE LYING!!!!  your ex left the house bc she was terrified of u. You were abusive. She asked u to rotate days until she got a place. She left only when u physically hurt her. And left when kids were sleeping and home before up. \n\nYou cheated and tried blaming her. You are a narcissist that abused, belittled, and took for granted. She tried fighting for the marriage. She is v pregnant again and u threatened her if she did not be get an abortion. You never tried with here.\n\nYou were nasty and vile. And don't forget about his u left her and the kids bc u were tieed to drive home. She distance as her. Left her there to deal with seizure and post partum, kids, job. While u you having NUMEROUS AFFAIRS.

U have done enough damage dont you think?", "Does it really matter if your ex is partying or not? They are your kids.", "YTA \n\nShe asks because you insisted on that rule. You don't have to say yes and she doesn't have to say yes when you ask her. Unless the grandma is unfit to take care of children you can't dictate who your ex has babysitting your kids. Grandmas age alone is not an indicator whether she's fit or not to be babysitting. \n\n\nDrop the rule for first refusal and focus on your parenting", "DONT BELIVE THIS BS TRUST ME.\n\n\nActually you are. You left your wife while u where cheating on her v for 2 years. You cheated on her during both pregnancies. U are a narcissist. She would levee bc your would physically abuse her and she was scared. She fought hard for u. All you did was abuse, belittle, threatened. She is pregnant and you won't even try therapy. You were lucky how good my cousin was to you. U used and abused her then threw her away.", "NTA\n\nIf you keep track of how often you have the kids, you could use that to have custody/visitation and support revised.", "NTA at all put your foot down", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOffer to take more custody, but sotrp her exploiting you.", "NTA but it sounds like you need to be the primary carer for the sake of your children - some people are just too selfish and narcissistic.", "Been there. My ex first ran around wearing out tinder, leaving the kids with me. Not even asking. Telling. As they got older and after I confronted her, she just started leaving them home alone. That\u2019s when the real trouble begins. Thankfully I\u2019ve saved one from her and he\u2019s an adult now. The other is still using the \u201ctwo house manipulations\u201d one for parenting and one to do whatever the hell they want. \nYou\u2019re NTA. She definitely is.\n\nEdit: For everyone saying \u201cdocument\u201d, it\u2019s a great idea but going to depend on the state laws and terms of divorce.

It\u2019s your right.", "You need to say No every time until she starts treating this situation fairly. \nOr another option is to document how often you are responsible for the kids when it is supposed to be her turn and take that information to the courts and get your custody plan revised and maybe some potential child support coming your way. Idk what state or country you are in, but any ammo against her is good to have. \n\nNTA. You are being taken advantage of.

It all makes a little more sense why you would insist on the right of first refusal which is now bitting you in a butt", "You may want to transfer all communication to a co-parenting/custody app. Messages can't be deleted on there and there's a record of everything so nothing can really be falsified or claimed to have been \"cherry-picked.\" Just an idea, though.", "Take to your attorney.   With as much as she's asking you to take them maybe you can get a different split like 70/30 or something else", ">Why would he want full custody when he resents having them as much as he already does?\n\nHe resents the mother for her shirking her responsibilities to her children and the lack of reciprocity, not at having them as much as he does.", "He resents having them?

But what he resents, specifically, is that she keeps asking him to take the kids off her hands, but always refuses to do the same for him. There's nothing wrong with being angry at your kids' other parent for not stepping up, but \"I want full custody\" is literally the opposite of what he's saying.", "You\u2019re insane. He resents the imbalance in the relationship with his ex, not having his kids. OP gives absolutely zero indication that he resents having the kids. He resents that when he needs the same favor returned, even when he is sick, his ex does not accommodate.", "I couldn\u2019t agree more and I\u2019m quite astonished by the extent of the misunderstanding in this situation. I never expected anyone to assume that OP harbors resentment towards his children", "And you feel that his having full custody would eliminate that imbalance? And *you* think *I'm* insane?\n\nI'm not saying he's T A. I'm not saying he's wrong to feel resentful. I'm saying that there is absolutely no indication that what he wants is full custody. I'm actually paying attention to what OP says he wants, instead of to what random people on reddit think would be a good way to punish his ex. And that's insane, sure. \ud83d\ude44"]}
