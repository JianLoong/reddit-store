I'd ask a social worker, or get some library books or online research, about what to do to make your house safer for someone with dementia. \n\nSIL doesn't like it, she can make arrangements to find another place for MIL to live, but she's not going to find anything for less money and this kind of personalized care.  \n\nThis is different than just renting out a room and basics.", "NTA. You can tell some of these people have never taken care of anyone in their lives. As a full time caregiver while running my own business and family home, I know you have been giving your MIL a steal. Nursing facilities would cost your mom 8k-10k PER MONTH for a small room. Assisted living not much less. Have your sister-in-law figure out where she will go and let her get a damn good reality check on how much things actually cost when she does not want to step in.  You charging anything shy of 5k is a deal and gift for your MIL.", "NTA at all. I don\u2019t think they realize you are taking all of the mils living expenses and care", "NTA $1000 is far less than she\u2019d pay for care outside of your home. You need to properly explain the increase, but honestly it would be reasonable to take control of all of her income if you\u2019re providing all her care.", "Nta after reading extra comments. I\u2019m in England and in a care home I used to work in the residents pay \u00a31000 A WEEK!!! Even if they self care they still pay that x", "NTA.

Taking care of someone with dementia is a lot of work. I think 1,000 is not too much to ask.", "Nah.  Reading your comments it\u2019s clear that you were not aware of all the additional costs it would take to care for her.  You need to show mil and sil why you want to increase the rent.  He how much each utility went up, the amount you spend on food for her.  You should also include the hours out your day where you\u2019re driving her to appointments and taking care of her other needs.", "nta \nbring a caregiver is a tiring, all encompassing and expensive", "NTA.

I dare anyone to find any service for someone with her condition for $13 a day. $1000 is a large leap, but it\u2019s much more appropriate compensation for what you\u2019re providing.", "Full time assistance and housing for a dementia patient starts at 30k per year in the United States, I am hard-pressed to see how you are taking advantage. Heck, I think most adults would consider rent, utilities, food and transportation costing less than half of their monthly income to be a steal\u2026", "It sounds to me like maybe there should be an unbiased third party involved. It makes sense that you would increase rent at some point in 5 years, but that is a big percentage of her income. But, you are paying for all of her other expenses as well, it sounds like. There is probably an accountant or someone that works with elders or some other person you and your family could meet with to figure out what is a fair amount. It\u2019s hard for us to say since we don\u2019t live in your area or know what your expenses are. Also, SIL needs to take into account other services you provide like cooking and driving. I\u2019m going with NAH, giving everyone the benefit of the doubt.", "NTA - you should be charging your SIL too for her portion of assisted living costs.", "YTA - it\u2019s understandable that costs go up and things have to change, but your rent increase sounds really extreme and based on you explaining how much her income is, you probably know that.\n\n$400 of $1,800 means that 22% of her monthly income went to rent\n\n$1,000 of $2,100 means that you will be taking 47% of her monthly income\n\nYou may need to reevaluate and find something that works for your MIL and her budget", "NTA.

Mom looked up the cost of assisted living facilities and taxi's (this was way before Uber and Lyft) to get Nana to and from church weekly and her pinochle games with friends and what my mom charged was a pittance.

You have NO obligation to raise MIL's rent by only as much as MIL's income has increased, especially when paying for all her food and staples. You can't control MIL's income or inflation. $1,000 a month in the current environment seems like a reasonable amount for MIL to pay to cover all costs related to food, housing, utilities, transportation and entertainment for a senior, and she still has more than 50% of her disposable income left over. Many people would be relieved to be in that position. You seem fine to me OP.", "He income went up 300 and you upped the rent by 600.

Sister can take her or she can give you the responsibility of her finances.  I was over my mothers finances for a long time until my older sister took over as caregiver.  I gave her over the finances too because additional cost pops up all the time and if she has the money she doesn\u2019t have to contact me to pay for medical visits. Medicine or whatever else that my Mom wants or needs.", "NTA. If your SIL has such an objection she is welcome to price out care homes", "$400 is definitely not enough but $1,000, I\u2019m not sure. So if you are in the US, the room and board costs (mortgage/rent, utilities, food) per social security is divided by the number of people in the home. All other expenditures should be clearly documented and receipts kept. I audit people on social security and if we see any excessively high charges for room/board, food, gas, unusual or high expenses, etc. there could be consequences. Keep a ledger (basically like a checkbook register) of these expenses each month, receipts for purchase you make on her behalf for 2 years and document how much time you spend in a caregiving role for her. That way if anyone has questions, whether it be social security, sister in law, or you need to be repaid from her estate when she is gone, you can show where the money is going and account for it. Otherwise, I think NTA because the alternative like assisted living or memory care would cost about 6x as much at least.", "Not sure. My understanding of many assisted living homes is when the resident is on fixed income, they pretty much take all of it except a small allowance for the resident to purchase extras beyond the basic needs. So that's her alternative: pay you less than half her fixed income for providing her a home, utilities, all her meals, all her transportation needs, and making sure she takes her meds on time, etc.... or give up almost the entire monthly check to a professional assisted living center and have just a few bucks left over to herself every month.\n\nDefinitely sounds like you're offering her a super deal, but perhaps failing to explain it very well to her understanding. Can't call an old lady with dementia the asshole here; she's compromised in her rationality. Don't believe you're being assholes, either, because this is more complex than simply a seemingly 'outrageous' rent hike.\n\nMaybe create a big chart for her depicting all the 'pros' of what she gets living with you vs. every viable alternative situation you can research. I mean, unless you are miserable taking care of her as you've described but for feeling unfairly compensated. If you're attitude is positive and you make her life pleasant, that is worth a lot, too.  Maybe offer her various levels of 'care' for less rent such as not eating expensive red meat at every meal and other areas where you can cut costs.", "NTA.  Look up adult foster care. Around here it\u2019s $5000-8000 per month. I do not recommend taking on family as they can become very abusive and a strain on the family. There are services depending on state (USA) but it requires other monies be exhausted. If sister doesn\u2019t like it sister can take her.", "NTA. She is welcome to go to a home where she can spend the money however she wants. Honestly, I\u2019d say $400 rent, $200 utilities, $400 food, $30 a day for taking care of her, that is $900.", "Totally understand this increase. I am sure you didn\u2019t know what would be involved in caring for someone with dementia or the costs. I helped with my grandmother years ago and it was more than full time and we even had sitters to help. It is 24 hours a day plus the increase in everything in your home. Good luck. I am sending you good thoughts because it is a long hard battle that defeats your soul some days.  You and your family are in my thoughts.", "NTA. For $1000 a month you will provide her with room, board, laundry, cleaning, nursing care (giving her her pills, etc), taxi service, heat, water/sewage, and entertainment. All while SIL holds the checkbook. You and your husband should plan a month\u2019s vacation leaving MIL with SIL for that time. Then she might understand what exactly you are being compensated for.", "NTA\nI care for my grandparents full time and they have dementia and other health issues and shit is HARD.", "NTA. I took care of my dad until he had to go into a facility. The facility he is in costs $3200 a month. $1000 is cheap for room, board, taxi, and care.", "NTA. The cost of everything has increased at an alarming rate. More than that, caring for someone with dementia is very difficult both physically and mentally. \n\nIt might be time for her to move to a memory care facility. Has she been formally evaluated by a neuropsychologist?", "NTA, but you should really be framing this as her caretakers. She's not renting a room, you're her medical caregivers, and sil is in charge of her finances.", "NTA. Is the increase a shock? Sure, considering you haven\u2019t increased it in 5 years. However. Break down the $1000 a month and it\u2019s $250 a week for rent, food, utilities, transportation, and 24/7 care. When you break it down as care alone, it comes out to about $36 a day. Break it down further and that\u2019s $1.50 an hour. Yeah\u2026 NTA.", "What exactly is she spending that money on? \n\nIf SIL wants separate accounting of everything start charging $400 rent, then her groceries, add up mileage and pay yourself the government rate.

While I would understand a 10% or maybe even a 20% increase (because COL is going crazy right now), 150% is extreme.", "YTA. \n\nWhile \"the cost of everything going up\" may be reasonable when it comes to charging more, increasing rent by 2.5 times is not reasonable at all. It gives a strong impression that you are attempting to take advantage of your MIL's increased income.", "150% rent increase is huge. And greedy.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Taking advantage of a person with dementia, especially your family, is pretty messed up. If you really need to increase a little because of expenses that's one thing, but it sounds like you're increasing it because \"she has extra money and we want it\". Shame.", "YTA because there is no way in hell that she's costing you an extra $600/month.", "Info: how do you figure such a price jump?", "YTA. Why a 150% increase? What is costing so much that you have to increse 600 dollars?", "YTA\n\nYour justification is that the cost of living is increasing but by doing this you are leaving your MIL less money once accommodation is paid for.", "NTA", "YTA that\u2019s an excessive increase. This feels like you are taking advantage of her. 150% is outrageous.", "YTA.  You can't more than double her rent just because \"the costs of everything are going up.\"  Yes, they are, but not to the extent that you are charging.  A more modest increase wouldn't have raised an eyebrow.  They are right to question what is going on with your price increase.  That's a little insane!\n\nEdit: I've been seeing the other comments, and while it does seem that perhaps there is some other caretaking happening here, the MIL is still cognizant enough to be upset about the price increase, so it seems like she isn't fully dependent on these people for absolutely everything.  It still seems like a room and board situation to me, mostly.  I also commented elsewhere that if this is causing a family problem, it may be time to find an assisted living facility for MIL.", "A lot of people say YTA and I would agree the sudden increase would be this but what is standard rent prices in your area?  Does she need assisted living?\n\nTaking care of someone with dementia is not easy and it might be better to look into other options for her to live.", "INFO: Why such a sharp increase? $600 is excessive.", "NAH.

You are having your time and labor ripped from you and you damn sure should not have to go into the hole financially when your MIL has the means to at least help you break even.

(Sis won't let her move in because having to care for someone 24/7 is damn hard and while Sis will hold the pursestrings she does not want to be bothered with the actual \"work work\" and she does not want to pay for the \"work work\". She  wants her brother and SIL to do all the heavy lifting and go into the hole financially while she dictates what they should do for Mom while she does nothing. This is a very common experience in families and for caregivers. They get told what they will continue to do and how much it better cost by other members of the family who won't ever do it the heavy lifting  themselves because its too hard. It is Too Hard. Anyone who takes this role on deserves a lot damn more than 5 thousand a month. Very few get anything for their time and energy. Its a real problem happening in America right now and it is primarily falling on the shoulders of women who have to exit the workplace to care for these people. Off my soapbox now. :) )"]}
