Her backing out is detrimental to your viewing experience as well, diminishing your value as well. \n\nThe fact is, it's your ticket. She never took possession of the ticket, and cancelling a contract returns both parties to their respective initial possessions: her with the value of the original cash in hand, you with the ticket. The receipt is only with your name, and you have not written contract, and in either case she's trying to cancel any contract. If tickets are going for higher prices, then you probably either gained access to a limited market space, or you spent the time to get list pricing, something you wished to share with a friend.

She went to the effort of getting the tickets and they were always in her possession, I didn't think anything of it. \n\nIf you think about it your friend screwed you over, you bought the tickets with her so that you could experience it together, she then pulled out effectively changing the experience you thought you were going to have.", "NTA, if they want to set up a scalping operation they can do it without involving you.", "NTA.

With that out of the way, she payed for the ticket when you bought it so it's technically her. So what she do or want's to do with the ticket it's her business (again fuck scalpers) even if you don't agree to it. If you wanted to take your sister with you you should have consider 3 tickets instead of 2, your friend have nothing to do with you wanted to use her ticket to invite your sister, so yeah you're an asshole. And at the same time, for the way your friend reacted she's also an asshole.\n\nAt this point do whatever you want with the ticket, cause in all honesty in your friend position i'll gladly take the money back so you can go with your sister, but since she's too greedy (for the third time fuck scalpers) to not care about it then you can do good without her in your life.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Eh, whether or not friend should have bought the ticket herself I'd say depends on what type of tickets they are.

The friend must renege on the OP so the OP is returning the cash value. As a gift of no hard feelings, OP may be inclined to return more than the initial value as cash, but such a gift would not imply an unrealized potential from illegal activity vis a vis scalping. It's important to note if OP acquired tickets at list price from a highly competitive ticket venue, then they themselves were missing out on not charging their friend \"market competitive pricing\". OP either had exclusive access to a restricted marketplace to avoid scalpers, or invested serious time to acquire the tickets at list pricing. \n\nOP's friend would be tantamount to buying an item on extreme sale and returning it expecting the higher surge pricing in return.

This is a group activity which is not transferable to strangers.

Firstly, I do think that it is a dick move of your friend to expect you to just go to a show alone (I'm assuming) as a beautiful, young female. That could be dangerous! Especially if you plan on drinking alcohol there.. op runs the risk of getting roofied and kidnapped into a human trafficking ring!! \n\nOn the other side, OP is possibly pulling a dick move by forcing her friend to give up an opportunity to make a very small fortune- which could make a huge difference in her life. We really have no idea her financial situation. Maybe she's been seeing a Sugar Daddy to make ends meet, and by selling this ticket- she can stop seeing him forever! She will now have more financial freedom (for a short time), but more importantly, she will regain her body autonomy. As someone who did sex work for like 5 minutes- this could be a huge deal. Absolute Life Changer. \n\nSo I don't necessarily think anyone is the AH here. It's going to be a hard decision for OP to make. I do hope you take everything into consideration before making a choice. \n\n**Side note: I saw Taylor reallllly close up at her show back during the Speak Now tour, where I got tickets last minute at a great price.

Op could have brought their sister from the start, if this make believe nonverbal agreement were to be followed.", "So, do you now what the offer and agreement were? I dont see where op described it.

Im transferring you the money now\u201d.\n\nThe moment the money was sent, the contract was completed. The friend purchased the ticket and it should have been transferred to them, it no longer belongs to OP. \n\nFrom everything she said in the OP, they had a verbal contract for the tickets and a plan to go together.

It's absolutely insane that anyone disagrees with this. OP's concert experience is already being damaged by the greed of her friend, but now if she were to cave in and give the ticket then her experience would be dramatically different than the intentions of the original purchase. She would be completely alone. It was purchased as a group activity. OP did all of the legwork (obtaining the code, fronting the money, waiting in queue) for the event, and bought two tickets to go with a friend.
