Her backing out is detrimental to your viewing experience as well, diminishing your value as well. \n\nThe fact is, it's your ticket. She never took possession of the ticket, and cancelling a contract returns both parties to their respective initial possessions: her with the value of the original cash in hand, you with the ticket. The receipt is only with your name, and you have not written contract, and in either case she's trying to cancel any contract. If tickets are going for higher prices, then you probably either gained access to a limited market space, or you spent the time to get list pricing, something you wished to share with a friend.

She went to the effort of getting the tickets and they were always in her possession, I didn't think anything of it. \n\nIf you think about it your friend screwed you over, you bought the tickets with her so that you could experience it together, she then pulled out effectively changing the experience you thought you were going to have.", "NTA, if they want to set up a scalping operation they can do it without involving you.", "NTA.

With that out of the way, she payed for the ticket when you bought it so it's technically her. So what she do or want's to do with the ticket it's her business (again fuck scalpers) even if you don't agree to it. If you wanted to take your sister with you you should have consider 3 tickets instead of 2, your friend have nothing to do with you wanted to use her ticket to invite your sister, so yeah you're an asshole. And at the same time, for the way your friend reacted she's also an asshole.\n\nAt this point do whatever you want with the ticket, cause in all honesty in your friend position i'll gladly take the money back so you can go with your sister, but since she's too greedy (for the third time fuck scalpers) to not care about it then you can do good without her in your life.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Eh, whether or not friend should have bought the ticket herself I'd say depends on what type of tickets they are.

The friend must renege on the OP so the OP is returning the cash value. As a gift of no hard feelings, OP may be inclined to return more than the initial value as cash, but such a gift would not imply an unrealized potential from illegal activity vis a vis scalping. It's important to note if OP acquired tickets at list price from a highly competitive ticket venue, then they themselves were missing out on not charging their friend \"market competitive pricing\". OP either had exclusive access to a restricted marketplace to avoid scalpers, or invested serious time to acquire the tickets at list pricing. \n\nOP's friend would be tantamount to buying an item on extreme sale and returning it expecting the higher surge pricing in return.

This is a group activity which is not transferable to strangers.

Firstly, I do think that it is a dick move of your friend to expect you to just go to a show alone (I'm assuming) as a beautiful, young female. That could be dangerous! Especially if you plan on drinking alcohol there.. op runs the risk of getting roofied and kidnapped into a human trafficking ring!! \n\nOn the other side, OP is possibly pulling a dick move by forcing her friend to give up an opportunity to make a very small fortune- which could make a huge difference in her life. We really have no idea her financial situation. Maybe she's been seeing a Sugar Daddy to make ends meet, and by selling this ticket- she can stop seeing him forever! She will now have more financial freedom (for a short time), but more importantly, she will regain her body autonomy. As someone who did sex work for like 5 minutes- this could be a huge deal. Absolute Life Changer. \n\nSo I don't necessarily think anyone is the AH here. It's going to be a hard decision for OP to make. I do hope you take everything into consideration before making a choice. \n\n**Side note: I saw Taylor reallllly close up at her show back during the Speak Now tour, where I got tickets last minute at a great price.

Bad analogy. Tickets were bought with OPs access code and OPs CC and the intention of OP going with someone they knew. Two seats side by side not a single seat beside someone who purchased a scalped ticket. NTA F the friend take the sister", "You can't sue for illegal profit. Scalping is illegal.", "Are u sure? I don't think this applies for all states.", "Scalping is legal in most places.", ">Scalping is a black market.\n\nI'll take blanket statements that may or may not apply for $200 Alex!", "Yeah, but the general consensus was that since she paid for her ticket it was her ticket even though the friend used her code to get tickets for the group.", "well, technically, yes, anyone can sue anyone over pretty much anything. Whether or not she would win is highly debatable.", "Because this situation came up about a month ago, except interestingly it was a YTA vote. The ruling in that post was that since the friend paid for the ticket, it was theirs and OP didn't own it anymore. The fact that possession never left the OP is a consequence of the fact its a digital ticket, but the intent was clearly to buy a ticket on behalf of another person and to ultimately use their money for it (making them pay OP back after purchase).", "Scalping sucks, but that has nothing to do with ownership.The friend paid for the ticket and then is the owner of the ticket.", "So I am sure that is legal in all 50 states but do acknowledge that there are some states that\nHave various restrictions on resale. It can vary from the location (aka online resale vs on-site resale) or the limits above face value. I can say that the particular company I work for does abide by those laws in accordance to each state. I\u2019m not a lawyer I\u2019m just a lowly customer support agent who goes by the book and tries to assist where I can.", "It\u2019s probably the eras tour in LA and it\u2019s illegal in California.", "The consensus in a very very different situation. It's almost like circumstances matter.", "If it\u2019s the one I\u2019m thinking of it was a group of friends led by the OP who were leaving super early and a friend wasn\u2019t ready yet, was maybe a half hour delayed, they were still early and the OP sent the money back to the person to take their sister instead", "Assuming this is for California, scalping is illegal. Note resale and scalping are two different concepts. Scalping is for a price that exceeds the face value. There are lots of venues that specifically give patrons permission to resell through their own process, but that\u2019s for face value, not for profit. \n\n\u201cAccording to the scalping laws in the state of California, a person who scalps tickets to an entertainment event, such as a movie premiere or a sold-out concert, will be considered to have committed an illegal act unless they have written permission to sell a ticket from the owner or operator of the venue.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/ticket-scalping-lawyers.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20scalping%20laws,or%20operator%20of%20the%20venue.\n\nOP is NTA. It\u2019s beyond shitty that the \u2018friend\u2019 would make OP go alone just to illegally scalp the ticket.", "in some regards, the ticket seller (eg ticketmaster) is more important than the state. If it's a paperless ticket, there are serious restrictions on gifting and re-sale.", "I completely agree. Friend was trying to make a shit profit over a very popular tour. OP was smart not to transfer the ticket over to friend quite yet.", "Then explain being able to use stub hub, SeatGeek or any number of other services to sell tickets for whatever you want. Im I\u2019m CA and have sold tickets I couldn\u2019t use on those sites for over face value without any problems. I\u2019ve also bought tickets for more than face value on those sites.", "[here you go](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/opinion/who-owns-my-ticket.html?unlocked_article_code=0x1mEmUnjltUv9SSQi1KxK-UQ4vN2515wSQzzkL2V6mAygdedIAofUQruQYti3085dddDTHv3xSJJ11wBpK41JmdeH5wKr9ez4inZCDOSTBes6-KrX-KFEWB4U0uu-cTSysU2ALChBJ1DEV0att4s-6Gkeyl5hiJF6cO3F1pwKqU20r6yBaV3CbN-xXtDWMUvSPscxX-1A1NgXZWaRCtLWTvcd6Jzpng7sUwauRwGthAi1jmQ8lTeHS74Fw5JHNtsd3EUck1REHk4pD1smt_RUeEGmjQtmMwp8lRFugn8xlTk3JMhG_yIDz8c6aRa7xqcv04sWqVdfZUB5JS&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)"]}
