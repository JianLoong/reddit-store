Why does she not have the ticket already? Are you sure a conflict arose on the date or is she just motivated by making money on it? Either way she paid you for the ticket already so it is hers, it's no longer yours... So yes YTA if you don't give her her ticket.", "NAH. I understand wanting to go to a concert with your friend/someone you know but your friend owns that ticket. She can do what she wants with it.", "NTA but maybe you can ask her what price she'd like for the ticket and you can pay her more than the list price. Because you expected to be able to be seated next to someone you know. Her backing out is detrimental to your viewing experience as well, diminishing your value as well. \n\nThe fact is, it's your ticket. She never took possession of the ticket, and cancelling a contract returns both parties to their respective initial possessions: her with the value of the original cash in hand, you with the ticket. The receipt is only with your name, and you have not written contract, and in either case she's trying to cancel any contract. If tickets are going for higher prices, then you probably either gained access to a limited market space, or you spent the time to get list pricing, something you wished to share with a friend. By offering her the ticket at list price to her in the first place you were limiting your potential monetary gains.", "YTA - it's her ticket. Your sister can buy it from her at the higher price if she wants to go", "Generally yta. She gave you the money to pay for it. Just give her the ticket.", "OP it's not your ticket it's hers and legally you need to send it to her.  If this is the hill you want to die on for your friendship then so be it and say goodbye to her.  You have no moral or civic duty to tell her what she does with her private property, just like she has no right for you to do the same thing with yours.", "NTA. Just refund her money, and let her be pissed. No one wants to go to a concert solo, INCLUDING the person she'll be trying to scalp it to. She'll just eat the ticket anyway.\n\nIf she bitches, just show her the terms & conditions of the purchase, it definitely says illegal to scalp", "NTA. My friend bought her and I tickets for Ed Sheeran years ago. I couldn't go in the end, she gave me the money back. She went to the effort of getting the tickets and they were always in her possession, I didn't think anything of it. \n\nIf you think about it your friend screwed you over, you bought the tickets with her so that you could experience it together, she then pulled out effectively changing the experience you thought you were going to have.", "NTA, if they want to set up a scalping operation they can do it without involving you.", "NTA. You know you aren't, that's why you are willing to let it end a friendship. Forget the scalping. She selfishly wants you to be forced to go alone. That's not a friend.", "YTA - she paid for it and it\u2019s hers to resell if she wants. Don\u2019t hold it hostage.", "I'll say ESH.  \n\n\nFirst, fuck scalpers. With that out of the way, she payed for the ticket when you bought it so it's technically her. So what she do or want's to do with the ticket it's her business (again fuck scalpers) even if you agree to it. If you wanted to take your sister with you you should have consider 3 tickets instead of 2, your friend have nothing to do with you wanted to use her ticket to invite your sister, so yeah you're an asshole. And at the same time, for the way your friend reacted she's also an asshole.  \n\n\nAt this point do whatever you want with the ticket, cause in all honesty in your friend position i'll gladly take the money back so you can go with your sister, but since she's too greedy (for the third time fuck scalpers) to not care about it then you can do good without her in your life.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Eh, whether or not friend should have bought the ticket herself I'd say depends on what type of tickets they are. If it's general admission, sure. If it's seats, then no. If they bought them separately they'd be unlikely to be seated together.", "Transactions require an exchange of goods. If the exchange was not completed then the terms of the implied contract were not fulfilled. The ticket was never given to the friend. The friend is cancelling the contract, so both parties are to be restored to their original value: OP with the ticket, friend with cash on hand. \n\nThe fact is OP was offering a deal to their friend with implied guarantees: the friend must sit beside OP. The friend must renege on the OP so the OP is returning the cash value. As a gift of no hard feelings, OP may be inclined to return more than the initial value as cash, but such a gift would not imply an unrealized potential from illegal activity vis a vis scalping. It's important to note if OP acquired tickets at list price from a highly competitive ticket venue, then they themselves were missing out on not charging their friend \"market competitive pricing\". OP either had exclusive access to a restricted marketplace to avoid scalpers, or invested serious time to acquire the tickets at list pricing. \n\nOP's friend would be tantamount to buying an item on extreme sale and returning it expecting the higher surge pricing in return. That's silly and unethical.", "How is OP the asshole? His friend flaked on him and he\u2019s trying to not go solo to a concert where prices will be marked up. OP made the purchase. \u201cFriend\u201d is trying to make a quick buck and ruining OP\u2019s concert experience. \n\nNTA OP. friend is a def asshole", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ethical of her to back out of our plans and leave me stranded alone when we agreed to go together. I will send her the money she paid back so she\u2019s not taking a loss\u2026", "That's not how ticketmaster really works anymore.  I doubt OP even has the ticket yet.\n\nGenerally they don't appear in your account until a few days before the show.\n\nI have tickets right now for a concert in October, but I don't have access to them yet.  I can't transfer them to anyone, and I think I just recently got access to sell them.", "her friend is Definetely an AH for even thinking about ruining this girls night by forcing her to go alone after she planned it and put in the effort.", "I would usually agree with this, but the friend also got the sale price because of OPs code. So it's weird if she wants to resell full/higher price. Makes me wonder if she really wanted to attend the concert or use the ticket to make money. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: clarification", "I know she\u2019s expecting to get at least 1K more than what she paid so it\u2019s way too much for me to give to her.", "If it\u2019s her ticket then why doesn\u2019t she have it? \ud83e\uddd0", "[removed]", "If it was her ticket should have got online and purchased it, she didn\u2019t. She agreed to pay for a ticket to go with OP.", "It's not hers legally. The ticket was in OP's name on their credit card. If anything OP was offering a deal to sell the ticket to their friend for list price instead of demanding a market value scalping price. The deal was to be able to sit next to a friend at a concert, something most people would value more than money. \"legally\" the friend is reneging on a verbal contract asking for a refund. Cancelling a contract legally requires both parties be returned to initial terms. OP with a ticket, friend with cash for said ticket.", "Are you saying she can sue me over this?", "Yeah, you aren\u2019t leaving her out of pocket.

I'm just saying that if you're buying tickets for seats (as opposed to general admission where you'll typically be standing and just have to sort of find a place to be) and you plan to go with one or more friends, you need to do the purchasing in one transaction or you and your friend(s) could end up in totally different sections of the venue, which would make for a less fun experience and frankly isn't really much different than going by yourself. \n\nAlso, OP says that her friend had a conflict and now can't go. I wouldn't call that \"deciding to flake.\"", "That's a pretty blanket statement. Does that mean you know what state Op is in? The legality varies by state and is regulated in far fewer than half of the states.", "this would be wrong...dont listen", "They're saying that this was a Taylor Swift show and there is no general admission, only reserved seating. So yeah, buying separately would've meant one of two things: either the friend would've ended up in another section or the friend wouldn't have been able to get a seat at all. If this is indeed a Taylor Swift concert, it probably sold out really fast.", "Maybe not deciding to flake, but a conscious decision to be a scalper rather than just make her own money back from not being able to go. She could have just accepted not being out of pocket given the conflict is in her end,  but no she decided she had to profit off it as well.", "I know what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m saying if ownership of the ticket mattered that much to the friend, she should\u2019ve bought it herself and given the second one to OP. \n\nI would understand the friend\u2019s perspective a little better if her sole interest wasn\u2019t in flipping this ticket for a quick G", "here is a link to some info.\n\n[Who owns a ticket](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/opinion/who-owns-my-ticket.html)", "no shit sherlock... do you know the fine print on tickets sold to these events? go look it up", "No, you.", "Paywall", "go back to watching judge judy", "Sure thing buddy,"]}
