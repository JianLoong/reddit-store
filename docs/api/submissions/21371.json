She never took possession of the ticket, and cancelling a contract returns both parties to their respective initial possessions: her with the value of the original cash in hand, you with the ticket. The receipt is only with your name, and you have not written contract, and in either case she's trying to cancel any contract. If tickets are going for higher prices, then you probably either gained access to a limited market space, or you spent the time to get list pricing, something you wished to share with a friend.

She went to the effort of getting the tickets and they were always in her possession, I didn't think anything of it. \n\nIf you think about it your friend screwed you over, you bought the tickets with her so that you could experience it together, she then pulled out effectively changing the experience you thought you were going to have.", "NTA, if they want to set up a scalping operation they can do it without involving you.", "NTA.

If you wanted to take your sister with you you should have consider 3 tickets instead of 2, your friend have nothing to do with you wanted to use her ticket to invite your sister, so yeah you're an asshole. And at the same time, for the way your friend reacted she's also an asshole.\n\nAt this point do whatever you want with the ticket, cause in all honesty in your friend position i'll gladly take the money back so you can go with your sister, but since she's too greedy (for the third time fuck scalpers) to not care about it then you can do good without her in your life.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Eh, whether or not friend should have bought the ticket herself I'd say depends on what type of tickets they are.

The friend must renege on the OP so the OP is returning the cash value. As a gift of no hard feelings, OP may be inclined to return more than the initial value as cash, but such a gift would not imply an unrealized potential from illegal activity vis a vis scalping. It's important to note if OP acquired tickets at list price from a highly competitive ticket venue, then they themselves were missing out on not charging their friend \"market competitive pricing\". OP either had exclusive access to a restricted marketplace to avoid scalpers, or invested serious time to acquire the tickets at list pricing. \n\nOP's friend would be tantamount to buying an item on extreme sale and returning it expecting the higher surge pricing in return.

This is a group activity which is not transferable to strangers.

Firstly, I do think that it is a dick move of your friend to expect you to just go to a show alone (I'm assuming) as a beautiful, young female. That could be dangerous! Especially if you plan on drinking alcohol there.. op runs the risk of getting roofied and kidnapped into a human trafficking ring!! \n\nOn the other side, OP is possibly pulling a dick move by forcing her friend to give up an opportunity to make a very small fortune- which could make a huge difference in her life. We really have no idea her financial situation. Maybe she's been seeing a Sugar Daddy to make ends meet, and by selling this ticket- she can stop seeing him forever! She will now have more financial freedom (for a short time), but more importantly, she will regain her body autonomy. As someone who did sex work for like 5 minutes- this could be a huge deal. Absolute Life Changer. \n\nSo I don't necessarily think anyone is the AH here. It's going to be a hard decision for OP to make. I do hope you take everything into consideration before making a choice. \n\n**Side note: I saw Taylor reallllly close up at her show back during the Speak Now tour, where I got tickets last minute at a great price.

Which, it's fine to feel that way, but it still doesn't change the fact that the ticket flat out stopped belonging to them the second they accepted payment.", "You can't sell something you don't own. Op didn't own the ticket. \n\nImagine buying a house and the seller cancelling it because you haven't gotten it yet", "It doesn't matter whether the friend was going to sell it or to attend it. We're not debating that aspect. Either the ticket changes possession upon monetary exchange, or it doesn't until the ticket changes hands. Which is it? Can't have it both ways.", "Not a group experience. Not a shared purchase. Not plans for the future. You made a request, and I did it for you. There is also no point where you cannot use the ticket and demand to make a profit off it anyway. You have managed to make a hypothetical where not a single aspect of it corresponds to the original issue or my original post. That's impressive. I can't decide if you're a bot or just really really don't understand what we are talking about.", "Not a 1:1. Scalping is illegal, winning a lottery ticket isn't.", "If not all contracts have to be signed then why doesn't it work the other way in op's favor? Listen to why does this make believe contract only exists to favor the person who's being an a******? If we're going by the nonverbal agreement then it should be that op purchase the tickets so that two people could go together. Once the friend flaked two people were no longer going together. Op could have brought their sister from the start, if this make believe nonverbal agreement were to be followed.", "So, do you now what the offer and agreement were? I dont see where op described it. If their talk was like\n\"Hey friend, want to go with me to this show? I get us Tickets and you pay me back later\" friend would have violated the contract by not going with OP. So op still has ownership.", "Yeah but you get a receipt in those cases. Doubt OP gave friend a receipt. If it\u2019s her name on the tickets, they\u2019re her tickets in the eyes of the concert venue.", "How is the friend going to prove the ticket is hers then? It\u2019s in OPs name, and as soon as OP reimburses her, the friend\u2019s claim to ticket ownership is null.", "I am aware of that. But i am asking you, do you know what the exact wording here was? If it was along \"want to go to this show with me? I get the tickets, just pay me back later\", then op only would have to give away the tickets when friend comes to the show.", "and refunded. never left ops acct", ">if the friend had bought her ticket herself and decided not to go at the last minute, she would have had no obligation to sell the ticket to someone OP knows just so OP doesn't have to go alone. why is it any different here?\n\nBecause she didn't buy the ticket herself.", "And if OP happens to have any texts that say \u201cthank you for agreeing to purchase the tickets in exchange for me going with you\u201d then she has a slam dunk case. Seems unlikely though. The friend on the other hand probably does have texts that say something like \u201cthank you so much for buying my ticket for me! Im transferring you the money now\u201d.\n\nThe moment the money was sent, the contract was completed. The friend purchased the ticket and it should have been transferred to them, it no longer belongs to OP. \n\nFrom everything she said in the OP, they had a verbal contract for the tickets and a plan to go together. They\u2019re not necessarily connected unless OP\u2019s friend received additional compensation/consideration (like discounted tickets) in exchange for going together. You can have a contract and also have a plan on how to execute the contract.", "I don\u2019t know where OP lives but verbal contracts are legally valid in many states, particularly if you have any texts or emails that could back it up. She accepted her friend\u2019s money in exchange for the ticket she purchased, that\u2019s a verbal contract. However, the friend\u2019s damages would probably be limited to the original price of the ticket. Would be harder to sue for their actual value but not impossible, if you had the time or money to throw at a real court case.", "Verbal contracts by definition aren\u2019t drawn up but can still be legally binding.", "\u2018The law\u2019? Which country? Which state? Which region? Which - please don\u2019t bother, honestly if I weren\u2019t so bored you wouldn\u2019t be worth it.", "For sure, but at least in my general experience every time I've fronted money for a group concert it's because we were going to go as a group. This includes meeting up beforehand and getting ready together to make sure we all get there safely and on time as a group. But I am aware that my general experience isn't everyone's. \n\nI've also never had a friend expect me to transfer their ticket right away since we all knew the game plan going into it. But yes if something were to come up and they would need to arrive late I would absolutely send them their ticket if needed. If they wanted to resell their ticket though I would tell them to piss off (in a loving way) and find someone else who wants to go lol\n\n> I live 20 minutes or less from several major venues. \n\nAlso, why wouldn't everyone you are going with just meet up at your house prior in these circumstances?", "Dude could you imagine going to an unfamiliar city and venue completely alone? The friend is most definitely the asshole for wanting OP to do that. OP had no intentions of going to the show alone, but the friend wants to make her do that so she can profit. It's absolutely insane that anyone disagrees with this. OP's concert experience is already being damaged by the greed of her friend, but now if she were to cave in and give the ticket then her experience would be dramatically different than the intentions of the original purchase. She would be completely alone. It was purchased as a group activity. OP did all of the legwork (obtaining the code, fronting the money, waiting in queue) for the event, and bought two tickets to go with a friend. If the friend no longer wants to go then the friend gets refunded and replaced. You can't expect someone to dramatically alter their night to the point of going completely alone for something they did all of the legwork on just so you can profit.", "Am I missing something? Op didn't sell the ticket? Refunded her.\n\n>Imagine buying a house and the seller cancelling it because you haven't gotten it yet\n\nAs long as they refund the money that's totally fine.", ">the sub should agree collectively in both cases\n\nWhy? Different people responding means different opinions and nuance matters. The sub isn't a hive mind.", "The tickets were bought with the agreement that they would attend together. Judgement relies on who broke the agreement, not who paid or who possesses the tickets.\n\n\nThus different verdicts.", "Exactly. People keep arguing whether scalping is illegal or immoral, but that's not relevant to the situation. Either the ticket is the friend's when she paid, or it isn't. Can't have it both ways.", "The concert isn't a shared experience, it's individual tickets.", "Because money was involved. Once you accepted money for an item, it's no longer yours. Verbal contracts are a real thing, you know that right?", "No, that's not how this works. You can't simply reimburse someone to unilaterally cancel a contract. \n\nOP, whether you're TA or not, your friend can take you to small claims court and would likely win.", "Which is more likely though? Be real.", "the seller cant refund, as it isnt his anymore.", "That\u2019s not how it works. I sell you something and it is mine: a mutual agreement. You cannot just refund me the money and claim it is yours again: the mutual agreement part is missing.", "LMFAO, oh my god the children are out in force today and they think they know the law!!!!", "Copying and pasting my response from another comment of mine:\n\nIn this circumstance, the verbal contract included that they were going together. Why is that part not enforceable and only the friends \u201cownership\u201d? If the verbal contract outlined conditional ownership for the friend - they own the ticket *if* they go to the show - and the friend is not going to meet the condition, why should they then get to turn around and detract from OPs experience?", "In this circumstance, the verbal contract included that they were going together, then. Why is that part not enforceable and only the friends \u201cownership\u201d? If the verbal contract outlined conditional ownership for the friend - they own the ticket *if* they go to the show - and the friend is not going to meet the condition, why should they then get to turn around and detract from OPs experience?", "If the friend was injured in an accident and couldn't go because of that and wanted to sell the ticket to help cover medical expenses, would anyone even be having an argument about this right now? Or is it just because the friend doesn't have a sympathetic enough reason (despite no details actually being given on why said friend can't go) that every one wants to act like OP is entitled to lay claim to something that stopped belonging to them the second they received payment for said item?\nWhat about if the ticket had been transferred? Would she be an AH for not immediately transferring the ticket back to OP? Or is this only okay because OP didn't transfer the ticket already?\n\nIf the question being asked was whether or not the friend was a dick for scalping, then sure. Yeah. Dick move. Hands down. But what the friend does with the ticket isn't actually relevant to whether or not OP has a right to lay claim (or reclaim) to something that fundamentally does not belong to them.", "Ah yes... What's she's refunding her friend and then selling it to her sister.\n\nNo. The seller doesn't get to decide to refund something that's not theirs", "I honestly don\u2019t know who is legally entitled to the ticket in this case, but I think the previous person\u2019s point is that the verbal contract wasn\u2019t just the ticket but also the understanding that they\u2019d be attending the concert together and the friend violated that part of the contract. Now that may not be a legal thing, but as a friend that\u2019s definitely the understanding and to say \u201cI should get to make a profit on my ticket and screw my friend who now has to either go to a concert alone or sell their own ticket\u201d is def an AH move. Since this isn\u2019t \u201cis this legal\u201d but rather AITA I\u2019m gonna say OP is NTA.", "Do you have a moral compass inside you? This isn't the legal advice subreddit this is a i t a. \n\nYou're being the asshole for suggesting that it's unreasonable that OP take their sister to enjoy an extremely desirable ticket. OP took the time and effort to get the tickets early to ensure good prices. If one ticket sells, OP is forced to go alone and sit by a random person.", "That op bought the tickets so both of them could go there together. So my Interpretation.", "people do that all the time. ex. sorry you bought it and now or stock is out, your not entitled to the first pick of the new batch; order it again. \n\npoint is transactions finalize when you gain possession of the item you bought, not before, the order can be changed and canceled beforehand and it's fine. it never left ops account so the transaction never finalized, if friend cared that much she should've pushed gaining ownership on payment so there's no confusion, like everyone else does when they buy things..", "This is a digital ticket. It\u2019s not a thing that exists in the world, for all intents and purposes, until you scan it to get into the show.\n\nThe friend has no access to the digital ticket. It is through OP that they have it. If OP reimburses their friend, then the friend can\u2019t claim ownership.", "\nI\u2019ve signed and drafted contracts in three countries.

The friend did not receive anything for agreeing to go with OP. No consideration = no contract. \nIf she has it in writing that she specifically agreed to buy the tickets in exchange for her friend going with her, I guess a court could side with her. But I really wouldn\u2019t count on it. The ticket became the legal property of OP\u2019s friend as soon as the money was exchanged.", "While it is possible to have a verbal contract for appearances, social agreements between friends do not count because that\u2019s super weird. The ownership of the ticket would only be conditional if outlined at the beginning when the tickets were bought, (so basically OP would have to have made clear that they bought two tickets and the friend could attend with them in exchange for the monetary cost of one of them, and that if they could no longer do so then OP would make the same offer to someone else). \n\nThis appears to be what OP is trying to enforce now, but it does not sound like that was the offer made when the tickets were purchased. If it was then OP would have included it because it strengthens their case.", "Until it's handed over it's still theirs. Or maybe until contracts are signed etc. Different in this situation. Op's friend is just being an ah. That ticket was bought for her so they can go together. She didn't, she lost her right to the ticket so got refunded.", "What about the money OP prevented the friend from making? Is it moral to take that from someone without their consent?", "This is not correct. Plus it wasn't out if stock. The person just decided they wanted it back after selling it.", "I suppose I just fail to see how this would possibly be enforceable. It\u2019s a digital ticket. My understanding of most digital tickets is that they need to be accessed by the account that purchased them.\n\nUnless OP had already transferred the digital ticket to the friend, all access to it is still conditional since it needs to go through OP.", "If social agreements between friends don't count, then there was never a contract to sell the ticket.
