Her backing out is detrimental to your viewing experience as well, diminishing your value as well. \n\nThe fact is, it's your ticket. She never took possession of the ticket, and cancelling a contract returns both parties to their respective initial possessions: her with the value of the original cash in hand, you with the ticket. The receipt is only with your name, and you have not written contract, and in either case she's trying to cancel any contract. If tickets are going for higher prices, then you probably either gained access to a limited market space, or you spent the time to get list pricing, something you wished to share with a friend.

She went to the effort of getting the tickets and they were always in her possession, I didn't think anything of it. \n\nIf you think about it your friend screwed you over, you bought the tickets with her so that you could experience it together, she then pulled out effectively changing the experience you thought you were going to have.", "NTA, if they want to set up a scalping operation they can do it without involving you.", "NTA.

With that out of the way, she payed for the ticket when you bought it so it's technically her. So what she do or want's to do with the ticket it's her business (again fuck scalpers) even if you don't agree to it. If you wanted to take your sister with you you should have consider 3 tickets instead of 2, your friend have nothing to do with you wanted to use her ticket to invite your sister, so yeah you're an asshole. And at the same time, for the way your friend reacted she's also an asshole.\n\nAt this point do whatever you want with the ticket, cause in all honesty in your friend position i'll gladly take the money back so you can go with your sister, but since she's too greedy (for the third time fuck scalpers) to not care about it then you can do good without her in your life.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Eh, whether or not friend should have bought the ticket herself I'd say depends on what type of tickets they are.

The friend must renege on the OP so the OP is returning the cash value. As a gift of no hard feelings, OP may be inclined to return more than the initial value as cash, but such a gift would not imply an unrealized potential from illegal activity vis a vis scalping. It's important to note if OP acquired tickets at list price from a highly competitive ticket venue, then they themselves were missing out on not charging their friend \"market competitive pricing\". OP either had exclusive access to a restricted marketplace to avoid scalpers, or invested serious time to acquire the tickets at list pricing. \n\nOP's friend would be tantamount to buying an item on extreme sale and returning it expecting the higher surge pricing in return.

This is a group activity which is not transferable to strangers.

You bought the new tickets they are yours! \nI gotta ask tough\u2026 do you want to take me to watch T. Swift? \ud83d\ude02", "I think this is a hard situation. Firstly, I do think that it is a dick move of your friend to expect you to just go to a show alone (I'm assuming) as a beautiful, young female. That could be dangerous! Especially if you plan on drinking alcohol there.. op runs the risk of getting roofied and kidnapped into a human trafficking ring!! \n\nOn the other side, OP is possibly pulling a dick move by forcing her friend to give up an opportunity to make a very small fortune- which could make a huge difference in her life. We really have no idea her financial situation. Maybe she's been seeing a Sugar Daddy to make ends meet, and by selling this ticket- she can stop seeing him forever! She will now have more financial freedom (for a short time), but more importantly, she will regain her body autonomy. As someone who did sex work for like 5 minutes- this could be a huge deal. Absolute Life Changer. \n\nSo I don't necessarily think anyone is the AH here. It's going to be a hard decision for OP to make. I do hope you take everything into consideration before making a choice. \n\n**Side note: I saw Taylor reallllly close up at her show back during the Speak Now tour, where I got tickets last minute at a great price.

No states have that kind of super strict anti scalping laws unfortunately.", "The circumstances may be different here (OP in the other thread deliberately ditched their friend and used excuses like \"She didn't reply to my texts [while she was working]\"), but it is kinda funny how this thread is all \"fuck scalpers\" and in the other thread, there was a fair number of people suggesting OP's friend sue her for the big bucks she could've made selling *her* ticket.\n\n\nNTA - you didn't buy the ticket to go alone, and you're the one who has it on their account, so tough tooties. I would say N A H (the friend does have a point that the ticket was technically hers once she paid OP for it), except, yeah, scalpers do suck.", "The devil is in the details as the saying goes.", "Definitely an old post.", "I wasn't trying to use it as a 'gotcha', I just didn't remember the part about leaving early and blaming the friend for not being available. I can see why the judgement changed in that context. \n\n\nThe underlying fact still remains though - in both examples, a person has bought a ticket on behalf of someone else and taken their money - the sub should agree collectively in both cases that ownership belongs to the friend after they have paid for the ticket, regardless of what they then choose to do with it.", "Definitely a shitty move tbh.\n\nIt's shitty not to transfer it, and it's shitty to just take away all agency from the friend on how her ticket should've been used.\n\nYes, she only \"bought\" a ticket through the OP's special discount, but personally, that doesn't mean that the ticket's the OP's to fuck around and just withdraw/pull if she doesn't feel like it unless it's explicitly not paid for yet ( the friend asked OP to pay for it in advance and have yet to give the money )\n\nScalping is a problem - but it's a separate problem from the original post. OP is definitely AH, friend debatably so beyond the scope due to scalping.", "Some venues allow it. Some don\u2019t. Mostly the government turns a blind eye to it regardless of whether the venue grants permission to the ticket holder to resell over face value. \n\nBut here people were debating whether the \u2018friend\u2019 could sue OP in California for a scalped price. I think it shouldn\u2019t be possible given that scalping is illegal in California. \n\nWhether people can get away with scalping without being prosecuted is irrelevant to ability of the person to sue OP for value of scalping it.", "ohtani was pitching at Petco today and tickets for the grassy knoll area which is the cheapest part of the park were an obscene amount over face value on vividseats and stubhub.  I have no idea where these people even get the above ideas from.", "The same as with other illegal activities. Doing something illegal doesnt necessarily lead to being prosecuted.", "The friend wasn\u2019t looking to sell the ticket though, she wanted to go. The OP in that situation, having forced her into a sale to OP\u2019s sister, just owed the friend fair market value at the very least . If the friend was genuinely unable to go, and wasn\u2019t intending on going, reimbursing her the cost would\u2019ve been reasonable. It was less about the value of what the ticket could sell for, and more about OP\u2019s friend being deprived of the experience which was worth far more than what the ticket had cost.", "Not quite, that friend wanted to see the concert herself and there would have been plenty time for her to get to the concert in time, but OP took the ticket away from her without even giving her a chance to use it.", "100% on the scalping thing.\n\nPart of me (100% conjecture thoughts for sure) also thinks there's a huge probability that they both knew the code and they might have both been online to double their chances of getting Tix and the op happened to be the one to get in.\nYesss, I recognize that's a huge leap of faith on that but it's not outside the realm of possibility cause it's a very non nefarious thing that happens between friends literally always?"]}
