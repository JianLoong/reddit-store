It's important to understand fully and completely that this is your house. He maybe thier son but his house with his wife isn't their house. Most in-laws tend to think that just coz it's thier son/daughters house they get to do what they want. But No. It's not how things work. \n\nYou get to decide when they come over and when not. You get to decorate you own house and keep it the way you feel comfortable to live in it with your husband and kids if any. The in-laws can give suggestions and offer to help. And \"No\" is a perfectly acceptable answer. They are not entitled to nothing in this house and have no right to demand anything or be disappointing about anything that dint go their way. \n\nYour husband doesn't have to feel torn apart here. He needs to stand up for you and explain to his parents that this is not their house and they need to respect you and your choices/boundaries in this house. And most importantly they cannot decide \"what's best for youll\" that's for you and your husband to decide.", "NTA\nHow come when people tell you how to do things in your own home, rearrange your furniture, and generally make a nuisance of themselves... But op is the controlling one?\n\nHusband needs to not just agree with you he needs to tell his parents to stop coming over unannounced and that while he still loves them, you both need space to live your life.\n\nAnother line husband should say is you keep saying I'm doing everything wrong yet you raised me, please let me use the skills you taught me to live my life as you raised me.", "NTA.  If they want to help, they need to understand that they\u2019re going to be soldiers, not generals.  It\u2019s your house and your life, so you and your husband should be creating the plans, and they need to just help execute them.  If they can\u2019t accept that you two are the ones calling the shots, then maybe you should stop letting them in when they come over uninvited to \u201chelp.\u201d  As an acquaintance of mine used to say, \u201cthat\u2019s not help, it\u2019s hell.\u201d", "NTA It's important for you to have boundaries and reinforce them. From my experience it sounds like his parents are probably codependent and have never have boundaries put in place that they had to respect. People tend to link codependency with addicts but it is something that alot of parents struggle with, as their entire identity is defined by the person (child) they are codependent towards.\n\nYou're doing the right thing and it is a good sign that your partner recognizes that this is happening. If they continue to disregard your wishes I have always found it best to sit them down and just explain to them respectfully that you ad him need space. \n\nIf they don't respect you enough to at least attempt to do so it is sometimes necessary to cut ties to a degree and just not be available. Can be a difficult thing to do, but if their behavior continues it could start causing more problems for you two, as people tend to drag others down rather than change. \n\nHope I helped at all and good luck as I've been there.", "I forgot but ever time I would go to their house I would move furniture around and just never say a word about it and leave.

My FIL actually hired someone to come and put an attic floor up in the garage. He paid for it but still should have asked or even told us first.

Needless to say that was hubbys side now!!", "NTA. You know they were overstepping. People who really mean to help will offer suggestions and back off. They **don't** come by uninvited, they **don't** re-arrange your furniture, and they **don't** unpack paint! They also don't leave in a huff, call to complain and try to guilt people into giving in.\n\nYour husband feels torn because they've done this to him all his life, haven't they? You didn't overreact. They didn't want to 'help', they wanted to take over. \n\nYour husband has to understand that he's an adult and he has to make his own decisions, not let Mommy and Daddy run his life He also has to understand his wife comes first.", ">We thanked them for their suggestions but politely informed them that we had already decided on a color scheme and layout. **Despite this, they began moving our furniture and unpacking paint, insisting that they knew what was best for us.**\r  \n\r  \nFeeling frustrated and overwhelmed, I firmly asked them to stop and reminded them that we had everything under control.

Seems more of a husband probleM, since this is not new and he does not take your point serious.\n\nI have spoken to my husband regarding my discomfort with my in-laws' behavior, but it seems that we view their actions from different angles.

Boundaries with overbearing inlaws are necessary. Set them now and stick to them.\n\nIt's been challenging trying to maintain a harmonious environment while also ensuring our home feels like ours. Your words are reassuring, especially when it comes to establishing and maintaining boundaries. It's not always easy, and I've been struggling with feeling assertive without wanting to come off as rude. Your encouragement means a lot and helps me feel more confident in my decisions. Balancing family harmony and personal space is tough, but your validation has truly helped. Thanks again.", ">But your husband needs to stand up for you. Is he usually weak in the face of his parents?\n\nMy husband has always been incredibly respectful and loving towards his parents, and while he knows the importance of setting boundaries, he often finds it challenging to stand up to them. His parents have always been influential figures in his life, and he genuinely struggles when it comes to balancing their desires with our need for independence and space as a couple.\r I believe he truly respects and supports me, but it's just challenging for him to navigate that balance.

You\u2019ve had no input into those rules and deserve the opportunity to create your own set of rules, it\u2019s unfair that you are just being swept into his rules as his partner.", "NTA - Start dropping into their house unannounced and offer suggestions for rearranging their furniture and updating their color scheme.  I'm sure they'd put a stop to it really quickly as it's their house and they have it how they want it.\n\nTurning up unannounced to your house whenever they feel like it is unacceptable.  Rearranging your furniture when they do is even worse.  You and your husband need to set firm boundaries and he needs to support you.", "Don't  worry about being \"rude\" to rude people."]}
