(I thought to myself at one point that he really loved his drugs.) After I finished the cig, I went in, he got the same bottle and handed it to me, said \"Finish your drink'. I was surprised but excused myself to the loo. I poured the beer into the toilet (saw some white powdery stuff at the bottom), and pretended to finish as I left. I made up an excuse and left right away.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, I told my sister about what happened and I said that he should be cut out. I explained that I wasn't comfortable that he put something in my drink and didn't acknowledge it. It was a fiasco over the next few weeks leading up to the holidays.
