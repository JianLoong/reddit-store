But before that happened, Gia had been married to my Uncle Grant for five years. Gia had been cheating on him with John. Uncle Grant was serving in the military for a lot of this time, so he didn\u2019t know until he returned home after an eight month deployment to discover that Gia was already three months pregnant and she confessed everything. My grandparents sided with Uncle Grant at first, but after they learned John was going to marry Gia for the baby (Zoey,) they told Grant to \u201cthink of what\u2019s best for the baby\u201d and forget John and Gia\u2019s cheating. Uncle Grant doesn\u2019t talk to them anymore, but kept in contact with my Dad and our family. Uncle Grant doesn\u2019t have a relationship with Zoey or her younger siblings (John Jr. and Emmy.) He explained to me when I asked him as a teenager that he feels keeping his distance is the kindest thing, because he does feel resentment and he knows it wouldn\u2019t be fair to Zoey to bring that kind of energy around her, which I do understand.\n\nSince yesterday was Father\u2019s Day, me and my immediate family hung out with Uncle Grant in the morning and went to my grandparents\u2019s house in the evening of dinner. Zoey was at my grandparents\u2019s house with her parents and siblings. Zoey complimented my necklace and asked how I got it. I kept my response vague by saying \u201cOh yeah, I got it as a birthday gift,\u201d and Zoey responded \u201cIt was from Uncle Grant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Uncle Grant is the only one in our family who really has money, so I realize now that that would be obvious.) I couldn\u2019t avoid it anymore without lying since Zoey asked directly, so I told her \u201cYes.\u201d Zoey got angry, saying that she knows from her parents that me and my brother constantly do fun stuff and get nice things from Uncle Grant and she demanded to know why she and her siblings have never gotten that same treatment from him. Zoey then made a nasty accusation as to why Uncle Grant only treats me and my brother the way he does. At that point, I pulled Zoey into a private room and offered to tell her the truth but warned her that her parents did some bad things and knowing would probably change the way she looks at them. Zoey still insisted on knowing, so I told her what happened in as unbiased a way as possible.\n\nObviously, Zoey was shocked and upset. She ended up getting into a argument with her parents and they went home early. Several different family members called me after and apparently it\u2019s a shitshow at John and Gia\u2019s house. Zoey wants to stay with our grandparents and is giving her own parents the cold shoulder, John Jr. is suspicious and asking questioning, and Emmy is upset/confused because Zoey and her parents were all pretty close before. Only my parents, brother, and Grant have my back. All the other adults in the family said I ruined Father\u2019s Day and should have left the past in the past. Zoey will be 18 in August and demanded the truth. I felt she has a right to know. AITA?\n\nEdit for clarification: Uncle Grant, John, and my Dad are all biological brothers. Gia has no biological relation to me.", "created_utc": 1687209112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dqtym/aita_for_ruining_fathers_day_by_telling_my_cousin/", "score": 1436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin deserves to know it's not her fault that her uncle avoids her and her siblings, but instead the fault of his faithless ex and his brother.

And her cheating parents, who again were Uncle Grant\u2019s ex-wife and own brother, hiding the truth about Uncle Grant, led directly to Zoey thinking Uncle Grant was racist, whether they knew/cared or not (I suspect that was preferable to the truth).", "In the post OP says Zoey will 18 in about a month", "Yeah but is it really her place to tell?  Likely the parents never would but may have been best to just tell her to ask her parents why uncle grant doesn\u2019t like them. This may be unpopular and get downvoted but it should have come from them not cousin gossip.", "I knew a girl who's half brother was her half cousin because her mom was boning her uncle.", "Even Hunter waited until his brother died", "I didn\u2019t even think of Grant being on deployment. Jfc there\u2019s so many layers to Gia and John\u2019s AHness that they\u2019re truly terrible people. I really feel for Grant, he truly doesn\u2019t deserve the hand life has dealt him.", "Him being deployed doesn't make it any better or worse", "I figured it out without the edit. If Gia was the biological aunt, why would Grant still be around. If Gia wasn't the biological aunt, and neither was John, why would their family still be involved with OP's family.\n\nThe only logical solution was that Grant and John were brothers. I actually scrolled back to the top to see if I missed OP mentioning it in the first paragraph.", "I don't think so. I assumed they were brothers.", "Same, and honestly it\u2019s never worth it to get caught up in someone else\u2019s lies. 100% NTA", "No point in lying \n\nYour aunt and her husband are both shit people, you just told their daughter about the shit things they did\n\nIf they didn\u2019t want their children knowing, they shouldn\u2019t have been shit people and done shit things", "It's a miracle that someone didn't crack", "Indeed. I do genetic genealogy as a hobby, and surprises are common.", "OP answered further up that the accusations involved racism.", "Jesus, you should put that in the OP.\n\nNTA btw, its not your job to hide her parents secrets, especially since it was his own brother!", "Someone told him. Not necessarily Unc.", "> These same people, including the malicious gossiper, will likely likely have some sort of salacious affair(a) of their own.\n\nNo, people aren\u2019t likely to have salacious affairs of their own, especially not one where a wife is cheating on her husband with the husband\u2019s own brother, resulting in the victim of the affair, becoming estranged with the family, and the children of the adulterers, believing he\u2019s ignoring them because he\u2019s racist, not because their mom cheated on him with their dad, his own brother.", ">well only 3 people lived that story, only they knew all the glory details and only them should have told her, yes absolutly  she should have knowed why uncle grant didn;t like her parents, her and her siblings, but not like that, ofcourse she is furious, she has been punished all her life for something her parents did!", "They hid the truth from her for 18 years. If they tell her anything it won\u2019t be the truth. Plus, Zooey was starting to make accusations that Grant was being racist, which is far from the truth. Had OP not nipped that in the bud, rumors and gossip might have started to flow and Grant\u2019s character would have been assassinated.", "Yes, it should have.  Years Ago, the first time she asked her parents why she never had a close relationship with Uncle Grant and the others did.\n\n\u201cYour Mom and I both did something that really hurt Uncle Grant.  Being around us still makes him mad and sad.  Some things apologies can\u2019t fix.  So he doesn\u2019t have much to do with us or you and your siblings.\u201d", "What happened here is not gossip. The cousins weren't all hanging out one day talking about what happened 18 years ago and what a big scandal it was and Zoey happened to hear.", "They probably would have made up some story to make OP look like she would be lying if she did ever tell her the truth. These cheaters were never going to tell their kids", "Wtf? It's anyone's place to tell the truth, don't be ridiculous. \n\nIf you are embarrassed about your actions, then don't cheat, it's pretty simple.", "It's not gossip though is it? It's the truth.", "Indeed; it *should* have come from John and Gia.  They chose not to address the issue for nearly eighteen years.  What makes you think they were ever gonna give Zoey that heart-to-heart about why Uncle Grant is cold and distant to them?", "The are under no obligation to keep their secrets.  Why should she lie for them? All she did is state the truth.", "Or with the sibling of your spouse. Both are the worst of the worst.", "I was wondering if maybe he was like \"Next-door-neighbor-turned-basically-part-of-the-family\" and Grant kept in touch with Papa OP (John's brother), since they were best friends, and the \"Uncle\" title was one of respect (I've got like 5 guys I call \"Uncle\" because they were my dad's childhood friends). \n\nStill, Zoey's jealousy didn't make sense in that context and I was going to ask for an INFO about their relationship, but then I saw the edit. YIKES.", "Yeah, that's how I knew also.", "Yeah that math wasn't exactly rocket science.", "Had the exact same thought process and also scrolled up.", "Wonder who put THAT in her head\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nINFO: So, what kinds of reasons did everyone *think* the kids were given as to why Uncle Grant didn\u2019t have a relationship with his brother and his family??", "Skin color?  Whoa - I thought it was something - excuse the pun, *darker*.", "That\u2019s a significantly better accusation but honestly being accused of being a racist is still not something to be taken lightly. And while it certainly won\u2019t have the life ruining impacts that the other one would it could still affect Grant if it got out and was believed. So yeah you definitely needed to tell her what was really happening.", "Does your father still have a relationship with John?", "Are we to take it that Aunt Gia is a lady of colour - and thus accusing the man who loved her and who she betrayed of racism? Or that everyone is of colour and the ex and brother are accusing the man they betrayed of colourism?\n\nEither way, how low to go after someone they already wronged.\n\nNTA OP - you were defending your wronged and innocent uncle from calumny.", "Might be worth mentioning that in an edit", "I meant OP's mother. What I understood was the implication that something illicit took place between OP's mom and Grant concerning OP and OP's brother. I might have missed something.\n\nAs far as Zoey's mother is concerned, truth!", "Are you the type that thinks 18 is the exact age that someone completely transforms and becomes an adult?", "I was thinking something similar until OP noted that Grant was the only one in the family with money. Before that, I was thinking something similar (my parents stayed close with my aunt after she and my uncle (dad's brother) divorced).", ">John and Gia are super assholes. Cheating on your spouse, while they are deployed, with their own brother?!?! Yuck.\n\nAnd then throwing him under the bus by bitching to your kids that he doesn't buy them things! Absolutely zero self-awareness from either of them.", "Naw. Y\u2019all just automatically assumed that. Lol. I took nasty as \u201ca bad accusation that she did not feel like disclosing in her post and therefore i will not make assumptions\u201d \n\nYou all just have to learn to not jump to conclusions.\n\nEdit: poor proofreading skills.", "Does it? I though it was very obviously an accusation of racism (or some other bigotry)", "My assumption was that someone was biracial and she was accusing Grant of being racist. It never even crossed my mind that it would be abuse.\n\nAlso, how would an abuse make sense here? That's not something that Zoey would try to throw in her cousin's face about why Uncle Grant avoids them. \"He doesn't want to abuse us, he's a jerk!\" If you though Uncle Grant was abusive, you'd be happy to avoid him.", "Yeah nah I definitely assumed racism, maybe we\u2019ve had different experiences in life but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a given that the post reads like a grooming case", "Probably, considering the fact that the OP was at the same house as them.", "From OP\u2019s phrasing, I\u2019m pretty sure the whole family is Black. Colorism is a thing.", "No, but if you aren\u2019t the kid\u2019s parent you shouldn\u2019t interfere if they are under 18. The parents could tell her earlier. OP doesn\u2019t know her emotional capabilities", "I personally didn\u2019t think grooming off too either. I been groomed or tried..unsure of how one would look at it\u2026still didn\u2019t cross my mind. I thought she was being a angry kid just shooting in the dark. I\u2019m sure she had her own thoughts before this and it came to a head when she confronted her.", "I actually assumed the OP's answer, but I'm mixed and colorism is real even in the family :(", "Is being accused of racism/colorism that much better? Jumping to conclusions doesn't really change the core of the comment, which is that someone who throws out accusations like that doesn't need to have their feelings considered. \n\nIf anything, that type of thing is more likely to hurt your career.", "Seriously. I read it as racism and not grooming. People on Reddit are quick to jump to conclusions. OP I personally don\u2019t think it reads that way a \u201cnasty accusation\u201d can be a variety of things.", "It probably depends on the readers background.\n\nI have a lot more personal experience with grooming/creepy older men/assault than racism, since I\u2019m so pale I glow in the dark, and I read it as grooming too.", "I read it as an accusation of the uncle fucking em.", "I also read it as being he's a creep.", "Nah you can be emotional distance from people even if their in the same house but you got a point", ">From OP\u2019s phrasing, I\u2019m pretty sure the whole family is Black. Colorism is a thing.\n\nGia and everyone biologically from my Dad's side of the family is black. Me and my brother are blasian because of our mom.\n\nAs I said earlier, there's no truth to Zoey's accusation; Our skin tones have nothing to do with why Uncle Grant doesn't have a relationship with her.", "The parents **could** tell her earlier.\n\nWhy is it on OP for the mistakes that the parents made?\n\nThe only other option is just to tell the girl to ask her parents about their fuck up. But we all know they won't tell the truth or the whole truth. Better than letting someone shit talk someone who did nothing wrong.", "Yeah. Not saying anything about the voracity of the actual accusation. Really not sure what your point was here to me.", "I know this isn\u2019t funny and that you probably used fake names but when I saw \u2018Aunt Gia\u2019, I thought this was going to be an Italian American family drama. I must be watching too much of Real Housewives of New Jersey.", "It\u2019s not on OP because she\u2019s old enough to hear it. It\u2019s absolutely not appropriate to burden a child with emotionally sensitive information without the support of her parents to help her work through the trauma of that information. It\u2019s not about \u201cshit talking\u201d", ">You all just have to learn to not jump to conclusions.\n\nWell this isn't an example of that. Because the conclusion had no effect on their opinion.", "No, Gia's her actual name. We all have pretty common names, so I didn't really feel the need to change them for the post.", "Same \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", ">It\u2019s not about \u201cshit talking\u201d\n\nSo if you were in her scenario. You would be 100% okay with her implying her Grant is a racist? And just letting her live her life until 40 years down the road (because lets both admit that her parents won't tell her the truth) thinking that OP and her side of the family is \"chill hanging out with racists?\" \n\ncool", "Wtf? Haha. That is even more ridiculous than your previous comment. It was still an assumption and jumping to a conclusion. Regardless of if it changes the judgement/opinion. \n\nYou\u2019re not the sharpest tool in the shed, huh?", "Why are you inventing an imaginary scenario just to be pissed off?", "Wtf are you talking about.\n\nThats literally what happened...\n\nWhats imaginary about this?\n\nOP said her cousin implied Grant only hangs out with them because they are light skinned and shit..."]}
