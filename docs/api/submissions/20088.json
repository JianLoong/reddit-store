But before that happened, Gia had been married to my Uncle Grant for five years. Gia had been cheating on him with John. Uncle Grant was serving in the military for a lot of this time, so he didn\u2019t know until he returned home after an eight month deployment to discover that Gia was already three months pregnant and she confessed everything. My grandparents sided with Uncle Grant at first, but after they learned John was going to marry Gia for the baby (Zoey,) they told Grant to \u201cthink of what\u2019s best for the baby\u201d and forget John and Gia\u2019s cheating. Uncle Grant doesn\u2019t talk to them anymore, but kept in contact with my Dad and our family. Uncle Grant doesn\u2019t have a relationship with Zoey or her younger siblings (John Jr. and Emmy.) He explained to me when I asked him as a teenager that he feels keeping his distance is the kindest thing, because he does feel resentment and he knows it wouldn\u2019t be fair to Zoey to bring that kind of energy around her, which I do understand.\n\nSince yesterday was Father\u2019s Day, me and my immediate family hung out with Uncle Grant in the morning and went to my grandparents\u2019s house in the evening of dinner. Zoey was at my grandparents\u2019s house with her parents and siblings. Zoey complimented my necklace and asked how I got it. I kept my response vague by saying \u201cOh yeah, I got it as a birthday gift,\u201d and Zoey responded \u201cIt was from Uncle Grant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Uncle Grant is the only one in our family who really has money, so I realize now that that would be obvious.) I couldn\u2019t avoid it anymore without lying since Zoey asked directly, so I told her \u201cYes.\u201d Zoey got angry, saying that she knows from her parents that me and my brother constantly do fun stuff and get nice things from Uncle Grant and she demanded to know why she and her siblings have never gotten that same treatment from him. Zoey then made a nasty accusation as to why Uncle Grant only treats me and my brother the way he does. At that point, I pulled Zoey into a private room and offered to tell her the truth but warned her that her parents did some bad things and knowing would probably change the way she looks at them. Zoey still insisted on knowing, so I told her what happened in as unbiased a way as possible.\n\nObviously, Zoey was shocked and upset. She ended up getting into a argument with her parents and they went home early. Several different family members called me after and apparently it\u2019s a shitshow at John and Gia\u2019s house. Zoey wants to stay with our grandparents and is giving her own parents the cold shoulder, John Jr. is suspicious and asking questioning, and Emmy is upset/confused because Zoey and her parents were all pretty close before. Only my parents, brother, and Grant have my back. All the other adults in the family said I ruined Father\u2019s Day and should have left the past in the past. Zoey will be 18 in August and demanded the truth. I felt she has a right to know. AITA?\n\nEdit for clarification: Uncle Grant, John, and my Dad are all biological brothers. Gia has no biological relation to me.", "created_utc": 1687209112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dqtym/aita_for_ruining_fathers_day_by_telling_my_cousin/", "score": 3267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin deserves to know it's not her fault that her uncle avoids her and her siblings, but instead the fault of his faithless ex and his brother. If people don't want to be seen as shitty people, they shouldn't do shitty things. Cheating on a deployed partner with their sibling is a pretty shitty thing to do and easily avoided.
