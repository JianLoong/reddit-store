Everyone was on board except for my middle son (13). He said he wanted to stay home. He said it was too hot to go outside. I said okay and told him to call me if anything happened and to keep his phone on him and answer if I checked on him.\n\nWe left at 10AM and drove to the beach, which is an hour away. We got there at eleven and stayed until three. We then had a late lunch/early dinner, because everyone was hungry. At this point I called my son and asked if he was hungry. He asked when we would be home, and I said probably around five. He said he wasn't that hungry.\n\nWe got home at five-thirty. My son asked when dinner would be, and I said probably seven. He said he was hungry, so I made him a snack. He sulked in the living room the entire time and then after he ate went and locked himself in his room. At dinner, he was still upset. His oldest brother asked why he was upset, and he said it was because we all had fun together without him and seemed happy he wasn't there. He also said we shouldn't have eaten without him.\n\nI said we had to eat, because everyone was hungry after being in the hot sun and exercising, and he said he didn't want to go. He said we always have more fun when he isn't around, which I said wasn't true. Then he started arguing with his siblings, so I put a twenty minute quiet timer on the table. After dessert he went and locked himself in his room again. He wouldn't talk to me when I was driving him to school. I feel bad, but I'm also unclear on what exactly he wanted.

He's annoyed the beach plan went ahead without him.\n\nSame for food. You called him, he said he wasn't hungry. He's now upset you didn't eat with him because he assumed you'd just not eat because he didn't want to.\n\nAgain, he's 13. He's a teenager. You've got to teach him that \"doing your own thing\" actually means \"doing your own thing\". Not that the group you're in changes its plans for you.", "NTA.\n\nThis is very important growth moment for your child. Very. Important.\n\nHe learned the people in his life aren\u2019t going to be emotionally manipulated by him. They are going to take him at his word and aren\u2019t going to beg him to join in. He can participate or be lonely.\n\nThis is how you prevent / stop narcissistic tendencies (which all kids have and grow out of as they mature and experience moments just like this.)\n\nYou all are refusing to join him \u201cin the boat\u201d. \nThat\u2019s good!\n\nI would touch base and ask him what he thinks \u201cshould\u201d have happened differently. Perhaps his answers will give you additional insight to him.", "NTA\nClearly he didn\u2019t think you would ACTUALLY go without him lol.  And if you DID force him to go he probably\nwould have made everyone miserable.  \n\nHe\u2019s 13 and this is a good lesson.", "NAH\n\nAt first glance it looks like normal teenage behavior.\nHowever the line \"everyone has more fun without\" should spark some concern.\nIt sounds like he could be depressed.\nDoes his behavior show consistent change? Does he isolate himself from family? Stay quiet most of the time? Talk with a quiet voice? Show aggressive behavior?", "NAH. I think it\u2019s a good thing to let your kids do their own thing *sometimes.* If one member of the family doesn\u2019t want to participate in a certain activity it\u2019s okay to leave them behind if it\u2019s safe. 13 is an age that\u2019s perfectly fine to be on your own for one day and he should also be capable of feeding himself from his own kitchen. \n\nTeenagers push boundaries, it\u2019s kind of their job. I think it\u2019s an important developmental step for him to learn that sometimes the thing you think you wanted isn\u2019t all that fun after all. \n\nI can\u2019t call a 13 year old an asshole just for doing completely age appropriate obnoxious teenager stuff. You\u2019re also not an asshole for allowing him to test those boundaries a little bit. But just keep an eye on him and make sure this remains in the healthy-boundary-testing zone. It\u2019s hard to say based on this one day whether his comments about feeling left out are normal teen angst or whether they\u2019re signs of depression or low self esteem or something else going on. Keep observing and let him opt out sometimes if he wants to, but not all the time, and make sure you do some family activities that he *does* enjoy occasionally so that he doesn\u2019t always want to opt out.", "NTA for him staying home, it was his choice and you made sure he was safe. But you really need to check in with him. He's clearly feeling like the black sheep of the family. Maybe take him out for one on one time, or do a family outing where he picks the activity and let him drive the day. 13 is a tough time, especially as a middle child. He may push you away, but keep telling him you love him and trying to include him in things", "NAH. He\u2019s an angsty teen. He will hate all things all the time unless he doesn\u2019t. Stock up on wine or chocolates (for yourself, I mean).", "NTA. The way your son acted reminded me of when I was younger. I remembered my parents asking me if I wanted to go out during the weekend and I chose to stay home yet when I found out they went to my favourite fast food place(we don't usually eat fast food so it's a luxury thing) without me, that made me upset and thinking back, it was more so the fact that I was an overthinker and took things too personally. Thus, I ended up hurting myself.  So you shouldn't worry too much and just do your best to reassure that the things that happened were just coincidences and that if you forced him to go out, he still might've ended up feeling upset anyways. \n\nPS. I am also a middle child and typically, the middle child gets dismissed more often(My parents' reasons being I am independent and mature enough to handle myself)so do try to express your love to your son just as often", "NTA - He's old enough to choose for himself. Having made his choice, now he regrets it. He's still a child, so he hasn't quite learned that his feelings are a direct result of his choice, not the actions of the rest of the family.", "NTA but I used to do that kinda stuff when I was depressed as a teen. Make sure he's okay.", "NTA, your son is old enough to want to be more independent, being given that independence means sometimes making choices you regret", "Nah. You did as requested. \n\nBut.\n \nIt sounds like he has some esteem issues he needs to talk with you about. \"everyone has more fun without me\" is bigger than a day at the beach", "NTA. I teach sixth grade, so the kids my class are just a little bit younger than your son, and I see this kind of behavior all the time. At school it looks like this: \n\nMe: This (insert fun thing here) is what we\u2019re doing!\n\nKid: Doesn\u2019t participate in fun thing by choice \n\nMe: That\u2019s fine, I can\u2019t force you to do it \n\nKid: Sad that classmates did fun thing\n\nMaybe if more kids learned this lesson at home I\u2019d deal with less kids who sit and sulk during and after school activities.", "NAH. He\u2019s a kid, and this is a good learning moment for him. \n\n\u201cWe wanted you to go but you said you didn\u2019t want to, that means you\u2019re going to miss out on what we\u2019re doing. Next time consider if you\u2019re comfortable with being left out before you leave yourself out.\u201d He needs to hear point blank (but in a kind and loving tone, perhaps with a hug) that he is the reason he missed out on what you guys did. \n\nHe needs to learn he can\u2019t expect people to revolve their plans around someone who isn\u2019t going. He likely just regrets not going, and doesn\u2019t have the introspection skills yet to understand that he\u2019s being unreasonable about it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong! This is a good lesson for him. If you leave yourself out, that means you\u2019re going to be left out.\n\nI do think you should speak to him properly about his feelings. He seems to be feeling a little lonely and left out in general. He could have easily been testing you guys to see if you\u2019d bend over backwards trying to get him to go. It seems he\u2019s just upset that you guys were \u201cso happy\u201d to exclude him. I think it warrants a conversation about boundaries and expectations. People aren\u2019t going to go that far trying to convince someone to attend an event or whatever they\u2019re doing. No means no, in any context, and people are going to believe him when he says he doesn\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s very juvenile (makes sense lol) to expect people to say \u201cno no please go! We want you there!\u201d \n\nThis is a tricky situation OP, but I think you need to have a long conversation with your son and figure out where this is coming from.", "NTA, your son is learning the consequences of his choices but he is taking the consequences out on everyone else.  Sit down and talk to him about the choices he made through the day and how often you asked him if he wanted to join.  You took his wants into account.  Now your son needs to come to terms with what happens after his choices.  The family had a fun day and he chose not to join.  He wasn't wrong but he can't take his anger out on you for respecting his wishes.", "NTA - sounds like a typical teenager.  Just tell him that he was invited to some, and if he is upset, to come the next time.", "NTA.You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But my suggestion would be to find something he wants to do next time as well.\n\nHe might be struggling to put it properly but while you do things he can do have you ever picked something he actually wants to do?\n\nMy girlfriends daughter has this issue with her dad. He does things with everyone but it\u2019s never what she wants. Just what his gf wants or what his gf\u2019s daughter wants. She tends to feel overlooked and neglected there.\n\nExample if he likes bowling. Take everyone bowling next time.", "The natural consequence for staying home when invited out is\u2026.feeling left out. You should tell him one time that you wanted him there and he declined. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He sounds like a typical 13-year-old--SUPER sensitive to perceived slights, even when they're only in his imagination. What are you gonna do.", "NTA he sounds like a bit of a drama queen. If he didn\u2019t want to go that\u2019s his problem.", "NTA -  You gave him options to chose from, didn't leave him behind intentionally, were available to reach if he needed you, and made sure he had a snack once you got home. \n\nHonestly, this sounds like it could be normal teenage behavior.  However, since he feels like everyone was better and had more fun without him, I do suggest checking in with him to make sure everything is okay, or if there is something bigger going on.  It can be hard to tell at that age.  If everything else is fine, then you can have a conversation about how you gave him choices and he made his.  That it is important to consider this in the future.", "NTA. I'm guessing perhaps your son was expecting you to bring food back? Or maybe start making dinner immediately which you understandably didn't want to do cause you were all kinda stuffed. Regardless, that was an expectation that he created and not one that you implied. \n\nAt the end of the day, you invited him and he declined. Was he wanting you all to have a miserable time without him? The silent treatment needs to get nipped in the bud. He's old enough to use his words.", "NTA this is usual early teen attitude/mood. They don't want to participate but then expect no one else to have fun without them. I regularly have to remind my own kids that the family does not revolve around them and their feelings", "Totally NTA here and really you did an awesome job as a parent. You gave him an awesome lesson and you did it with grace. He is his own person and he deserves to be respected and treated as an individual and by leaving him home you did just that. Yeah he then realized that he should have gone with you and will think long and hard next time. \n\nBut he is still a child and his feelings of \u201cyou having more fun without him\u201d are SO valid. This is where your attention should be to make him know that you would of had way more fun WITH him. But you will still have fun of course because you were doing a fun activity. Make sure he knows that your fun with him gone had nothing to do with him not being there. He needs to feel important still.", "NTA. You tried to get him to go with you and he wanted to stay home. It's his own fault.", "NTA. He chose to stay home. You\u2019re not going to force everyone else to sulk because the teenager decided to sulk.", "NTA. You allowed him to make a choice and he did. He then regretted it, maybe. More likely, it sounds like he has deep seated issues about his place in the family dynamic and that\u2019s really what the issue is. \n\nSounds like a talk is in order to find out why he feels that way and what\u2019s going on with his self-esteem.", "Oh love, you are not the AH, you just have teenagers. They\u2019re absolutely irrational sometimes and perfect mini besties at others. Keep your head high mama.

You were actually being a considerate parent for allowing him to stay at home; I'm absolutely certain that my mother never offered a choice!\nTeenagers are curious and volatile creatures; sulking is inevitable. Make sure you do something fun soon to include him in the gang again - even though he snubbed himself; for now, though, you're the baddie I'm afraid.", "NTA. He\u2019s old enough to decide to stay home, and you\u2019re old enough to take your other kids out without him. He said he didn\u2019t want food when you called about it. Sounds like he just had FOMO but is a normal teenager so won\u2019t admit that, he\u2019ll just make it your fault (my two teens are the same)", "NTA. He\u2019s at an age where he needs to learn that he can make decisions for himself but he can\u2019t decide how others respond or decide anything for anyone else.

Bet they come back early anyways all sad and sweaty\"", "NTA I think this is why my dad always forced us all to go. There were times when I didn\u2019t want to go.

He might need reassurance that you all love him and want to spend time with him, and to carefully consider the choices he makes.", "NTA and 13 is the beginning of the teenager years, and most things will become a fight for then because no other reason than hormones naturally lol. You did everything you should have:\n\n1. You asked everyone who wanted to go and he said he didn't want to go.\n2. You let him stay home by himself (I'm guessing at that age you trust him to take care of himself which is great).\n3. You checked on him asking if he was hungry when you all went to grab food to include him.\n4.

He will get over it. Keep doing you mama.", "NTA he\u2019s flexing his manipulation wings. By saying he didn\u2019t want to go meant he wanted everyone to stay home. By going he wanted it to be a bad day for those who went and it wasn\u2019t. By eating since dining out is fun he resented that you had fun. Eventually the roller coaster of selfish feelings will end when he realizes the world won\u2019t stop on his whim.", "I had this exact experience. I didn't want to go on an outing with a long car journey involved when I was about 15. The rest of my family went, had a blast at a blues festival on a rare hot sunny summer day in ireland, went to a festival, and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. I regretted not going, but even as a teen, I recognised that other people were allowed to have fun without me and that I had made my own decisions. \n\nKids 13, so I'd maybe approach this with as much compassion as possible. As much as possible, try and turn it into a life lesson for him without making him feel awful? At 13, this might be his first proper teenage sulk and he's probably not able to think it through rationally in the same way you'd expect an adult to be able to. It's a very difficult time emotionally for even the most well adjusted kid, so I'd try not to make too much of it all", ">Same for food. You called him, he said he wasn't hungry.

He probably saw a day of time alone to game or watch TV but didn't realize that it seems less fun after 7 hours or whatever. A \"grass is always greener\" situation.", "I agree. It could be a case of intentionally leaving yourself out so you feel justified in your feelings. I think young teens and kids do this a lot. They don\u2019t understand why they feel left out and lonely when they\u2019re in the same room as everyone else, so they actually leave themselves out intentionally to justify the feeling and to make sense of it. \n\nSeems like he could be insecure in his place, and is self sabotaging in order to make sense of the feelings.

If I didn\u2019t like the weather, I didn\u2019t join in on outdoor family activities. In time, and with communication from my mom (the one who raised us), I learned that them having fun was not to spite me, and it was me who made the choice to not go.\n\nOP\u2019s son just needs a little clarification.", "Depends.\n\nSnacks? Yeah sure\n\nA lot of 13 year olds do not know their way around a kitchen.\n\nBut I'd argue the bigger issue is the fact that he said \"no I'm not hungry\" and thought \"well I said I'm not hungry so they'll change their plans\"\n\nAnd not \"I need to figure out what to do now, because I need to eat\". \n\nHe's 13.

Was it because it was too hot, or was there another reason? \n\nBecause everything else sounds like normal teen behaviour of wanting something (like a day alone to do whatever you want) and then realising it isn't what you wanted after all. \n\nBut the \"we always have more fun when he isn't around\" line worries me a little. He's at a stage where he can feel easily excluded if he is already struggling with something. \n\nEven though the exclusion was of his own doing, his parents must ensure he knows this isn't the case. He can tell them if he's feeling this way in other scenarios, like making friends in high school, etc.\n\nLife moves fast when you're thirteen.", "I think the manipulation is more after the fact not as much in the moment of that makes sense.\n\nBut likely a little bit of both.", ">A lot of 13 year olds do not know their way around a kitchen.\n\nand that is the parents fault", "Plenty of 13 year olds do not know how to cook a meal and that's not a big deal. \n\nThough I would argue that 13 is old enough to bodge a sandwich together.\n\nAnd you know what, he probably does.

It's absolutely astonishing to me. He didn't even have to make anything that complicated either - he couldn't make a sandwich for himself? Seriously?", "I'm a huge dork and started a \"cooking club\" with the other neighborhood kids when I was eight. We rotated houses and had to have an adult willing to give up their kitchen and supervise us for anything like cutting vegetables, but we did okay for ourselves. One kid taught us a recipe for microwave brownies that was an absolute god send. All of us were allowed to make them without supervision, and most of our households kept the ingredients on hand.

It this situation isn't about a kid being ignored. It's a kid choosing a different activity and regretting the decision.  \n\nMost of us have been in that very same situation. It sucks.  It's difficult to deal with as a 13yr old with possible raging hormones and all the changes that happen physically and mentally at that age. \n\nGiving a teen a choice, holding them accountable for that choice, and then reviewing that choice with them to help them learn better for the next choice is all good parenting in my book. \n\nThe one thing missing from the OP is that last piece. To which I would give a mild YTA to OP for not following up and learning why the 14 yr old *really* didn't want to go \" too hot \" is a lame excuse for the beach.  Likely there is something else going on there and hopefully is discussed.", "I think you're projecting just a teeny tiny bit, and I mean that with the greatest respect. This is not a child \"being ignored\". If he wasn't invited, you would have a valid point. But that's not what happened. He was invited, and he chose not to go. And then he got pissed at the natural consequences of his own actions: *because* he chose not to go, he didn't get to partake in the fun times everyone else had planned. \n\nHe could have avoided this, at any point, by going with them. But, because he's 13 and doesn't have a fantastic grasp of consequences, he didn't foresee this outcome where his family had fun without him - and, because he's 13, he's blaming this on his family instead of going \"Huh, maybe I should go with them next time!\""]}
