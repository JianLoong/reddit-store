Had a friend who went to a facility like you\u2019re sending your kid to. Instead of getting better, she picked up a pill and alcohol addiction. Went off the rails after getting out and is 1000x worse off than before. Just know that most people in jail are not there for stealing a couple hundred bucks, they are there for real shit. Scary shit. I hope you understand what you\u2019re exposing your daughter to. Drugs and other paraphernalia are quite ubiquitous in those facilities, it\u2019s quite surprising what you can smuggle in. Oh and don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse.", "INFO: What punishments had you previously used? (Usually there are a few steps between \"slap on the wrists\" to \"spending a full year in jail\" - but it sounds like you jumped from one to the other?)", "If this is true, and I sincerely hope it isn\u2019t, YTA. Do you have the faintest clue what happens to kids in juvenile detention, aka jail? I\u2019m here to tell you it sure as hell isn\u2019t rehabilitation. It\u2019s abuse, for girls often sexual abuse. It\u2019s isolation. It\u2019s cold. For $800, you take away your child\u2019s phone. You take away their privileges such as driving. You make them get a job to pay you back, so they learn how hard you have to work to net $800. You don\u2019t sentence your kid to a year of terror.", "all i gotta say is, i didn't learn about real criminal shit til after i got in trouble the first time and had to do community service with real felons...it didn't have the deterrent effect on my 13 year old ass, it taught me how to do more crimes lol", "Uh yeah. Definitely the asshole. There are better ways to have handled this, and trying to \"get her charged as an adult\" tells me you've lost your damn mind. \n\nDisciplinary actions, sure, have at it. But jail for your kid?", "Why do you not think community service or some other punishment other than jail time is sufficient for a 16 yo? If she's never gotten into serious trouble before, you have no reason to believe this wouldn't be sufficient punishment for her. \n\nI think you are bordering on asshole behavior. I don't like when parents expect the law and the police to fill in for their shortcomings as parents.", "YTA. Unlike in the movie, the stint in the prison rarely puts people on the right path. It usually results in inability to get job and life long problems.  The question you need to ask - what is your goal? to make a point and punish the daughter or to create the best opportunity for her to learn the lesson.  Maybe this is a time to either drop the charges or worked out the deal which does not leave her with permanent record", "YTA. You are lying to yourself if you thought scaring her straight would work. You've only introduced endless collateral consequences. You have changed her life for the worse.", "YTA because arrested? Sure. But keeping up charges and having her actually spend a year in jail- what?! Why couldn't you have told her to get a job and pay you back, have her do community service instead of jail time. Also a different therapist maybe if her current one isn't working?? When she gets out, she'll never want to see you again.", "I\u2019ve seen some good points here. On the one hand if you didn\u2019t do anything she could\u2019ve stolen more and it could\u2019ve escalated. I\u2019ve seen that happen with old classmates and friends of mine from school over the years and I\u2019ve seen what happens when it gets worse. It\u2019s not pretty. Almost always started with stealing money from their parents. On the other hand, the charges would go on her record and colleges and future jobs see that. It would essentially follow her for the rest of her life. I think pressing charges was a little harsh and more like a last resort kind of thing to do.", "YTA. Excellent plan- totally destroy her ability to get into college or get s solid job. Because that won\u2019t keep her from financial hardship and risky behavior in the future or anything.\nShe\u2019s your kid- maybe try parenting her. Do community service with her. Talk to her therapist. Make an actual plan with your ex about how to approach the situation. You basically went fro 0 to 5000 in a heartbeat. Good luck getting her to talk to you once she turns 18.", "YTA...dude cmon.. while I completely agree what she did was extremely wrong, $800 is a lot of money, but she's 16 years old.. SIX TEEN. She needed to learn her lesson, absolutely. I think the \"small penalty like community service\" along with the police scare would be enough. But clearly this behavior isn't a random rebellious act as you stated. I saw you commented what previous punishments you've attempted to enforce, like taking her phone away. Obviously that didn't work and you need to explore other disciplinary actions... but pressing charges, and refusing to drop them??? Now I'm not a parent, but that's probably not the next appropriate step to take. \n\nShe's your daughter.... do you want any sort of future for her? If so, these charges are not it...", "Sure if you think jail for your kid is a successful parenting lesson then you won. Doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any specific priors you mention to really warrant this tho. There\u2019s just an appeal to vagueness about a rebellious streak. She did a baaad thing and that does necessitate a response but sending your kid to juvie? I\u2019d be a fucking mess, not posting about it here. The amount of disappointment in me as a parent to get to this point would prevent me from posting it, rather than attempting to crowd source sympathy. YTA", "YTA.

Could you have taken her phone and grounded her until she paid the money back, with the threat of pressing charges if she resisted?", "YTA- this will go on her record and will actually mess up getting jobs for her in the future or into college. Her life will now be hard for her forever because of this and things will end up worse instead of better. \n\nNTA- for teaching her a lesson, still couldve used police, ask them to talk to her/scare her , possibly holding her for a few hours or overnight.

I only say this as someone who also had a rebellious phase. Speaking from my own experience a decade later, I don\u2019t believe that your approach will actually teach her the lesson you\u2019re hoping for. Instead, I think she\u2019s more likely to get involved with the wrong crowd. I also don\u2019t think she\u2019d view being detained as a consequence of her actions, but as a consequence of you. \n\nTake this route if that\u2019s what you feel you need to do, but I just thought I\u2019d try and give you another perspective.

It's a hard lesson to learn and maybe she'll think next time before she does anything stupid again.", "It\u2019s 50/50 with her. She probably won\u2019t learn anything either. Given that she doesn\u2019t listen to you two and therapy ain\u2019t working. She put herself on this destructive path", "I hope your wife takes you back to court and wins full custody over this manipulative and abusive behavior. YTA", "NTA", "EDIT: OP is divorced (I can see why). Everything else below stands. \n\nCongratulations. You\u2019ve ruined or significantly and long-term reduced the quality of your daughter\u2019s life, and most likely ruined your marriage, over $800 and relatively normal teenage rebellion. I hope you\u2019re happy dying alone. YTA.\n\nTo add more to this, there are really four issues here. \n\n1) Spending an extended period of time in juvenile detention will likely significantly harm your daughter. Since this is an obvious overreaction on your part, she will (justifiably, in my opinion) be angry the whole time and will be around a lot of other angry teenagers who have significantly less to lose than your daughter. This will be a real exposure to that kind of lifestyle for someone who is in a mindset to see merit in anger and escalation. She isn\u2019t going to meet people there who are dedicating themselves to be better after they leave detention. \n\n2) This will be on her record. Even if it is sealed or expunged, it will still come up in deep background checks. She probably won\u2019t be going to a normal high school, and will be behind on her education. \n\n3) You\u2019ve violated her trust. Even though she broke your trust first, there is an expectation that parents will protect their children. She is going through what sounds like a relatively bad, but not abnormal, teenage rebellion phase. This is a point in time where she really needs help from her parents showing compassion and guidance. She will either exit this phase of her life knowing what compassion and love can do when a person is hurting (she is hurting right now, which is why she\u2019s acting out) or she will exit this phase of her life learning that she can\u2019t rely on family or loved ones. What type of person do you want your daughter to become? This decision is bigger than anything else you have or could do as a parent, and will either reinforce any good, loving parenting you\u2019ve shown her in the past, or will destroy any past effort you\u2019ve made. Your decision.\n\n4) You\u2019ve betrayed your wife. Not only have you betrayed her trust in your, you\u2019ve negated all or much of the past effort that she has put into raising her daughter. \n\nI hope it\u2019s not too late for you to undo what you\u2019ve done. I hope so for your daughter\u2019s and wife\u2019s sake, as well as for your own, although I expect you\u2019ve already permanently damaged your own relationship with both of them no matter what happens now. I would never trust you again.", "Yes, YTA, and you have no idea what you've condemned your daughter to.\n\nShe's probably acting out because she knows you don't love her.", "YTA, this is gonna mess up your kids future, nontheless i find it super based xD.", "Nta if you don't stop now you don't stop never ever. It's not easy to be a father.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s the consequences of her actions.\n\nBut you are basically ending any hope of ever having a relationship with her again, so you need to decide if you want her to turn her life around, and maybe have a relationship with you again in the future, or send her to jail over $800", "Seriously, what country would put a teenager in juvenile prison for a year for stealing $800? Whilst I agree with going to the police if you go through with this you are going to ruin her life, all for $800. Dude calm the hell down, drop the charges, ground her and make her do all the shitty chores until she \"earns\" back the money.\n\nYTA if you go through with this", "YTA she has her wake up call already, now make her get a job and repay you every cent with interest", "INFO: it depends on what else she has done, and what punishments you have tried. If it has slowly escalated to this point NTA. If your going from grounding to jail, YTA.", "Yta.  That\u2019s normal kid teenage stuff. And you\u2019re going to really set her back. You and her need a therapist and you need to work out better rules and punishment. Your 16 year old doesn\u2019t need to go to jail for a year.", "OP, I hope this isn't true, but if it is, then it is extreme. She could have worked to give that money back to you. I know it is a lot of money, and stealing isn't okay, but she is your daughter. I don't condone what she did because it is fluffed up, but she is acting out for a reason. Therapy will only help if her environment is changing to the better, too. What is going on at your ex house? Are you working together in a healthy way for your child?\n\nSomewhere along the line, her behavior has been proven to be taught somewhere, and if your Ex hasn't been firm or you, of course, it will escalate.\nYou take her phone away. No driving with the car. No haning out with friends when she is at your house. \nThere are other stuff you could have done. You just made your daughter hate you more, and because she will be where she is, she will learn more of the bad stuff and won't learn a damn thing.\nShe will be traumatized too, because what I have heard, things happen in juvenile detention, and often it is sex crimes, so when she gets out, she will be a distant memory of herself.\n\nGreat parenting \ud83d\udc4d she is gonna resent you.", "YTA\n\nYou resorted to that because you don't even want to try to be a parent anymore.", "YTA. \n\nthey\u2019re right. she wont learn anything, other than the fact she is literally gonna hate you because you ruined her future in her eyes. yes she stole from you and that was wrong, getting her arrested was scary enough, but pressing charges on a teenager for a stupid mistake she made as a kid is gonna mess her up even more. dont press charges.", "Don't you think you escalated very fast on this?", "YTA\n\nYou are literally locking your daughter out of a number of future career paths with this.\n\nHonestly sounds like this girl grew up with a shit father, broken home. I doubt she stood a chance.\n\nJust having the police come, maybe a night in jail, maybe even community service if you hate your daughter.\n\nBut getting her sent to juvey for this? You are quite literally choosing to try and ruin her life", "YTA\n\nI agree what she did was terrible, and she needs a real intervention kinda moment, but a year in jail will only traumatize her. Being \"scared straight\" isn't really effective", "Something is missing from this story. For a first offense of a non-violent, low dollar crime as a minor, a year of juvy seems more than even a possible max sentence. Even a free public defender is gonna plea this down to a no juvy time deal. So does your daughter have a record?", "For $800 you saw fit to give your daughter a criminal record? Really?? You understand that her behavior & acting out speaks more about yours & your wife's parenting than it does about her, right? So you've doubled the damage and set her up for a more difficult future.", "Well you pretty much ruined all chances of a good relationship, her having a chance at college/good job  or moving abroad. Bit extreme for what appears to be the first serious offence.", "YTA \n\nWho needs enemies when they\u2019ve got a dad like you? You\u2019re about to ruin her life and she\u2019ll likely cut you off one day. \n\nYou\u2019re an awful parent. No wonder she is the way she is.", "You\u2019ve just ruined your daughter\u2019s entire life. If she\u2019s \u201clucky\u201d, she might be able to get gang protection. But she won\u2019t come out of this- not as the same person. \n\nWithdraw the charges- you\u2019ve scared her. Now leave her alone to recover from her own FATHER nearly throwing her to the criminal underworld. \n\nYTA.", "WOW, YTA.\n\nDo you really want to ruin your daughters life?", "YTA, this is a ridiculously cruel level of escalation. Also, have you never heard of putting money in a bank account wtf", "Yta - well done, you have turned a rebellious kid into a career criminal, this is not a hallmark movie and despite your obviously sheltered life causing a large misconception she will come out a lot worse than she was going in! In years to come when she is an addict commiting all sorts of crime to fund her habit....you and only you are the cause of it all", "You mean your ex has a daughter. You won\u2019t have one anymore after this. This isn\u2019t the act of a father, it\u2019s not \u201ctough love\u201d. This is monstrous. YTA \n\nI seriously hope karma catches up to you.", "You\u2019re literally ruining her life, YTA. You think she deserved to be raped and sexually abused for stealing $800? How could anyone want that for their CHILD? You\u2019re supposed to love her. But you\u2019re just a monster. She\u2019ll never be able to get a good job. She\u2019ll never be able to go to college. She\u2019ll be stuck at dead end jobs for the rest of her life with no future. Is that what you want? Do you hate her that much? She will never forgive you", "YTA big time!!", "YTA - you tried to get her TRIED AS AN ADULT??? What the actual fuck, man.", "Yta but i might get downvoted but I am curious though, would redditors feel the same way if she stole money from someone else and they press charges?", "Your daughter will regret having you as a father. And rightly so. You're no more than an egotistical sperm donor at this stage. YTA.", "NTA..better she learns now than later.", "I sincerely hope this isn't true.. You probably just lost your daughter forever..  Over $800. Hope it was worth it. \ud83d\ude10", "YTA\n\nYou had so many other options.", "Are stories posted here 100% true? I'm fairly new to Reddit and this sub. Often they seem like clickbaity stories that are written to guarantee a rabid response. Comment farming. \n\nIf it is true, YTA.", "NTA she is old enough to know the consequences for her actions. I don\u2019t understand why people think this is so bad. If this was a stranger doing this at the same age you would press charges.", "YTA - now your kid will have a record and thus screwing her over for jobs, you\u2019ve set her back at least a year and you\u2019ll be exposing her to other criminals as well. (Not to mention the abuse and assault that she\u2019s gonna face in there) \n\nand you did that to her. She\u2019s not gonna come out of it thinking that she needs to change her ways. She\u2019s gonna come out it thinking that you intentionally sent her in knowing exactly the type of abuse she\u2019s gonna get and she will resent you for life.", "You are not only TA but seriously a huge MF.\nHoly crap. You think you're the hero but in fact you are responsible for your childs behavior.\n\nYTA. I am so sick of \"parents\" like you.", "YTA.\n\nDude, you sent your daughter to jail. Do you feel good about that? Congrats, you really taught her a lesson. All it cost was fucking up her future. But hey, you got to make your point, so golf clap for that I guess.\n\nI actually would like to know the answer to my question above - do you honestly feel like you made the right choice here? Is your daughter really worth less than $800 to you?", "YTA. You not only gave up on your literal child, but have chosen to permanently destroy her life. Juvi won't rehabilitate her, but it will permanently affect the rest of her development and expose her to abuse. Where's the family therapy? Payment plan with interest? Asking her therapist the best plan?", "My nice career I just landed this year almost didn't pan out because of Juvenile convictions I had. These things can haunt you for a while. Kids will be kids. I see both sides here tho", "I wish I could hurt you for thinking the police are the people you turn to when you\u2019re not man enough to run your family. I guarantee you\u2019ve never been to jail it\u2019s always the weak little cry baby people like you that ruin things.", "YTA. I worked in juvie. Do not send your kid there as a lesson. What you will do is introduce her to a slew of criminals, a system that does not care about her, trauma, and perhaps physical and/or sexual abuse. Make her pay that money back with interest. Do not send her to juvie. Please.", "Absolutely YTA. \n\nOur daughter went through that stage. She stole 1400. Her phone and use of the car was taken away and she didn't get it back till she paid it back. \n\nShe did, after a year. She's a great kid, in college,  21 now and we have a great relationship.\n\nWhat your daughter did deserves discipline, not governmental punishment. She's 16, she's your daughter, and what you did will not only NOT scare her straight, she will resent you for years, if not for the rest of her life.\n\nThat is some lazy ass parenting.", "YTA. Congrats on destroying your kids life.", "Idiot", "YTA. Damn you wanted her charged as an adult? As a former social worker, girls juvie is just as bad if not worse than the boys side. It\u2019s dangerous and honestly unhygienic. Rampant sexual abuse and drugs as well. You want to be the one to make sure she has a criminal record? You actually want her to spend an entire year locked away? You\u2019re almost guaranteeing she\u2019ll be around the wrong people, abandoned, and traumatized by the system.", "I would put the kid into therapy if it was that bad. In no way do they deserve PRISON. Are you obtuse? Prison, for a girl especially, means SA and prison in general is just sh*t. You put her in prison if she\u2019s like a murderer or something, for stealing $800? Hell no.", "ESH \nWhy didn't you force all the friends who benefited to return the clothes and anything else they received from this theft?  I'm concerned that juvenile hall will only harden her!", "Forget asshole\n\nWorst parent ever\n\nRemove your scrotum\n\nDon't breed\n\nYou just lost your daughter", "Exactly. This is a ridiculous escalation. No allowance until she pays it back. YTA \n\nThat being said, I find it hard to believe the juvenile court is going to put her away for a year as a first offense over this. The judge who does that is an asshole too.", "I don't get the judge here. \n\nWhy do they try to get a 16y old getting punished with adult punishment? What's wrong with american judges", "Kids have re-offending rates of 34.2%....highest out of all categories. Kids are a sponge and will learn whatever you feed them. When my daughter had detention i jokingly said 'I hope you didn't make any friends!'. Good luck with that op. YTA.", "All the things you describe = parenting. As a parent, my first question is how do I do better here and seek help in that. OP, you can\u2019t outsource parenting. YTA for putting your daughter through worse and expecting a better outcome. Now she lost a parent and gained a rough edge in her life. Good job.\n\nIf I were you OP, I\u2019d go to therapy and talk to someone about how I affected my child or can do better. You raised her, if this is an example of how it makes sense why she\u2019s pushing to extremes with you.", "I have to agree. What she did was really bad, but a year in juvenile detention would probably make everything much, much worse.", "His (deleted?) reply would be hilarious if it wasn\u2019t so sad. Definitely one of the biggest AH to ever post here.", "Also, I dont think daughter will learn anything, the only thoughts she will have is her father put her behind bars over 800$........", "Lmao. Maybe she shouldn't have stolen $800 from a safe with plans to steal more. Sounds like she's ruining her own life just fine.", "stealing money shouldn't be normal kid teenage stuff lol", "I find it hard to believe that they would put her in a juvenile detention center for this. I interned at a juvenile detention center in graduate school and the kids \u201cbehind the fence\u201d as they would say were kids with multiple offenses and serious offenses like attempted murder or multiple drug charges, larceny, etc.", "Cause there is no inbetween? It\u2018s jail or no consequences?", "jesus you sound like one of those lazy yet reactive people who thinks \"oh this person is a problem, let's just lock them up.\" Angela Davis said \"prisons do not disappear social problems, they disappear human beings.\" How about investing in meaningful healing and rehabilitation? How about looking at evidence-based solutions to increase public safety /or better outcomes for youth? Prison only exacerbates poor social outcomes. It further traumatizes and disenfranchises people to the point where it is extremely difficult to ever really be able to participate in or contribute or even fully return to society (housing/homelessness, lack of job opportunities/upward mobility/hiring discrimination, poverty, food scarcity, lack of education, mental health, physical health, addiction, no voting, lack of support system). And we leave no alternatives. If your \"tough on crime\" mentality works so well, then why hasn't it eradicated crime? At the enormous scale we are incarcerating people in the US, it does not have the desired impact on public safety.

Again, my point is that this will NOT make her \u201cthink before doing stupid shit.\u201d It\u2019ll put her in the same circle as bad influences, and any sense of accountability will be overshadowed by the fact that her father pressed charges against her. This does not mean \u201cbecause he\u2019s her father, he should let it go\u201d - it means that no lessons will be learned, because he\u2019s her father.
