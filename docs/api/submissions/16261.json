Had a friend who went to a facility like you\u2019re sending your kid to. Instead of getting better, she picked up a pill and alcohol addiction. Went off the rails after getting out and is 1000x worse off than before. Just know that most people in jail are not there for stealing a couple hundred bucks, they are there for real shit. Scary shit. I hope you understand what you\u2019re exposing your daughter to. Drugs and other paraphernalia are quite ubiquitous in those facilities, it\u2019s quite surprising what you can smuggle in. Oh and don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse.", "INFO: What punishments had you previously used? (Usually there are a few steps between \"slap on the wrists\" to \"spending a full year in jail\" - but it sounds like you jumped from one to the other?)", "If this is true, and I sincerely hope it isn\u2019t, YTA. Do you have the faintest clue what happens to kids in juvenile detention, aka jail? I\u2019m here to tell you it sure as hell isn\u2019t rehabilitation. It\u2019s abuse, for girls often sexual abuse. It\u2019s isolation. It\u2019s cold. For $800, you take away your child\u2019s phone. You take away their privileges such as driving. You make them get a job to pay you back, so they learn how hard you have to work to net $800. You don\u2019t sentence your kid to a year of terror.", "all i gotta say is, i didn't learn about real criminal shit til after i got in trouble the first time and had to do community service with real felons...it didn't have the deterrent effect on my 13 year old ass, it taught me how to do more crimes lol", "Uh yeah. Definitely the asshole. There are better ways to have handled this, and trying to \"get her charged as an adult\" tells me you've lost your damn mind. \n\nDisciplinary actions, sure, have at it. But jail for your kid?", "Why do you not think community service or some other punishment other than jail time is sufficient for a 16 yo? If she's never gotten into serious trouble before, you have no reason to believe this wouldn't be sufficient punishment for her. \n\nI think you are bordering on asshole behavior. I don't like when parents expect the law and the police to fill in for their shortcomings as parents.", "YTA. Unlike in the movie, the stint in the prison rarely puts people on the right path. It usually results in inability to get job and life long problems.  The question you need to ask - what is your goal? to make a point and punish the daughter or to create the best opportunity for her to learn the lesson.  Maybe this is a time to either drop the charges or worked out the deal which does not leave her with permanent record", "YTA. You are lying to yourself if you thought scaring her straight would work. You've only introduced endless collateral consequences. You have changed her life for the worse.", "YTA because arrested? Sure. But keeping up charges and having her actually spend a year in jail- what?! Why couldn't you have told her to get a job and pay you back, have her do community service instead of jail time. Also a different therapist maybe if her current one isn't working?? When she gets out, she'll never want to see you again.", "I\u2019ve seen some good points here. On the one hand if you didn\u2019t do anything she could\u2019ve stolen more and it could\u2019ve escalated. I\u2019ve seen that happen with old classmates and friends of mine from school over the years and I\u2019ve seen what happens when it gets worse. It\u2019s not pretty. Almost always started with stealing money from their parents. On the other hand, the charges would go on her record and colleges and future jobs see that. It would essentially follow her for the rest of her life. I think pressing charges was a little harsh and more like a last resort kind of thing to do.", "YTA. Excellent plan- totally destroy her ability to get into college or get s solid job. Because that won\u2019t keep her from financial hardship and risky behavior in the future or anything.\nShe\u2019s your kid- maybe try parenting her. Do community service with her. Talk to her therapist. Make an actual plan with your ex about how to approach the situation. You basically went fro 0 to 5000 in a heartbeat. Good luck getting her to talk to you once she turns 18.", "YTA...dude cmon.. while I completely agree what she did was extremely wrong, $800 is a lot of money, but she's 16 years old.. SIX TEEN. She needed to learn her lesson, absolutely. I think the \"small penalty like community service\" along with the police scare would be enough. But clearly this behavior isn't a random rebellious act as you stated. I saw you commented what previous punishments you've attempted to enforce, like taking her phone away. Obviously that didn't work and you need to explore other disciplinary actions... but pressing charges, and refusing to drop them??? Now I'm not a parent, but that's probably not the next appropriate step to take. \n\nShe's your daughter.... do you want any sort of future for her? If so, these charges are not it...", "Sure if you think jail for your kid is a successful parenting lesson then you won. Doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any specific priors you mention to really warrant this tho. There\u2019s just an appeal to vagueness about a rebellious streak. She did a baaad thing and that does necessitate a response but sending your kid to juvie? I\u2019d be a fucking mess, not posting about it here. The amount of disappointment in me as a parent to get to this point would prevent me from posting it, rather than attempting to crowd source sympathy. YTA", "YTA.

She\u2019s going to have trouble getting a job, getting an apartment, you are very short sighted.", "ESH. What she did was bad. She\u2019s an asshole\nTeen. Your response was too extreme.

Could you have taken her phone and grounded her until she paid the money back, with the threat of pressing charges if she resisted?", "YTA- this will go on her record and will actually mess up getting jobs for her in the future or into college. Her life will now be hard for her forever because of this and things will end up worse instead of better. \n\nNTA- for teaching her a lesson, still couldve used police, ask them to talk to her/scare her , possibly holding her for a few hours or overnight.

She is 16 and sounds like she is hanging with the wrong crowd.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA as your daughter undoubtedly needs to learn her lesson, but I do personally think that there\u2019s better ways to handle this. I only say this as someone who also had a rebellious phase. Speaking from my own experience a decade later, I don\u2019t believe that your approach will actually teach her the lesson you\u2019re hoping for. Instead, I think she\u2019s more likely to get involved with the wrong crowd. I also don\u2019t think she\u2019d view being detained as a consequence of her actions, but as a consequence of you. \n\nTake this route if that\u2019s what you feel you need to do, but I just thought I\u2019d try and give you another perspective.

This isn\u2019t a scared straight program this is a year in Juvie with everything from dealers and petty thieves to actual killers and once you enter this life you usually don\u2019t leave it.
