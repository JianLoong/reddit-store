Had a friend who went to a facility like you\u2019re sending your kid to. Instead of getting better, she picked up a pill and alcohol addiction. Went off the rails after getting out and is 1000x worse off than before. Just know that most people in jail are not there for stealing a couple hundred bucks, they are there for real shit. Scary shit. I hope you understand what you\u2019re exposing your daughter to. Drugs and other paraphernalia are quite ubiquitous in those facilities, it\u2019s quite surprising what you can smuggle in. Oh and don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse.", "INFO: What punishments had you previously used? (Usually there are a few steps between \"slap on the wrists\" to \"spending a full year in jail\" - but it sounds like you jumped from one to the other?)", "If this is true, and I sincerely hope it isn\u2019t, YTA. Do you have the faintest clue what happens to kids in juvenile detention, aka jail? I\u2019m here to tell you it sure as hell isn\u2019t rehabilitation. It\u2019s abuse, for girls often sexual abuse. It\u2019s isolation. It\u2019s cold. For $800, you take away your child\u2019s phone. You take away their privileges such as driving. You make them get a job to pay you back, so they learn how hard you have to work to net $800. You don\u2019t sentence your kid to a year of terror.", "all i gotta say is, i didn't learn about real criminal shit til after i got in trouble the first time and had to do community service with real felons...it didn't have the deterrent effect on my 13 year old ass, it taught me how to do more crimes lol", "Uh yeah. Definitely the asshole. There are better ways to have handled this, and trying to \"get her charged as an adult\" tells me you've lost your damn mind. \n\nDisciplinary actions, sure, have at it. But jail for your kid?", "Why do you not think community service or some other punishment other than jail time is sufficient for a 16 yo? If she's never gotten into serious trouble before, you have no reason to believe this wouldn't be sufficient punishment for her. \n\nI think you are bordering on asshole behavior. I don't like when parents expect the law and the police to fill in for their shortcomings as parents.", "YTA. Unlike in the movie, the stint in the prison rarely puts people on the right path. It usually results in inability to get job and life long problems.  The question you need to ask - what is your goal? to make a point and punish the daughter or to create the best opportunity for her to learn the lesson.  Maybe this is a time to either drop the charges or worked out the deal which does not leave her with permanent record", "YTA. You are lying to yourself if you thought scaring her straight would work. You've only introduced endless collateral consequences. You have changed her life for the worse.", "YTA because arrested? Sure. But keeping up charges and having her actually spend a year in jail- what?! Why couldn't you have told her to get a job and pay you back, have her do community service instead of jail time. Also a different therapist maybe if her current one isn't working?? When she gets out, she'll never want to see you again.", "I\u2019ve seen some good points here. On the one hand if you didn\u2019t do anything she could\u2019ve stolen more and it could\u2019ve escalated. I\u2019ve seen that happen with old classmates and friends of mine from school over the years and I\u2019ve seen what happens when it gets worse. It\u2019s not pretty. Almost always started with stealing money from their parents. On the other hand, the charges would go on her record and colleges and future jobs see that. It would essentially follow her for the rest of her life. I think pressing charges was a little harsh and more like a last resort kind of thing to do.", "YTA. Excellent plan- totally destroy her ability to get into college or get s solid job. Because that won\u2019t keep her from financial hardship and risky behavior in the future or anything.\nShe\u2019s your kid- maybe try parenting her. Do community service with her. Talk to her therapist. Make an actual plan with your ex about how to approach the situation. You basically went fro 0 to 5000 in a heartbeat. Good luck getting her to talk to you once she turns 18.", "YTA...dude cmon.. while I completely agree what she did was extremely wrong, $800 is a lot of money, but she's 16 years old.. SIX TEEN. She needed to learn her lesson, absolutely. I think the \"small penalty like community service\" along with the police scare would be enough. But clearly this behavior isn't a random rebellious act as you stated. I saw you commented what previous punishments you've attempted to enforce, like taking her phone away. Obviously that didn't work and you need to explore other disciplinary actions... but pressing charges, and refusing to drop them??? Now I'm not a parent, but that's probably not the next appropriate step to take. \n\nShe's your daughter.... do you want any sort of future for her? If so, these charges are not it...", "Sure if you think jail for your kid is a successful parenting lesson then you won. Doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any specific priors you mention to really warrant this tho. There\u2019s just an appeal to vagueness about a rebellious streak. She did a baaad thing and that does necessitate a response but sending your kid to juvie? I\u2019d be a fucking mess, not posting about it here. The amount of disappointment in me as a parent to get to this point would prevent me from posting it, rather than attempting to crowd source sympathy. YTA", "YTA.

Could you have taken her phone and grounded her until she paid the money back, with the threat of pressing charges if she resisted?", "YTA- this will go on her record and will actually mess up getting jobs for her in the future or into college. Her life will now be hard for her forever because of this and things will end up worse instead of better. \n\nNTA- for teaching her a lesson, still couldve used police, ask them to talk to her/scare her , possibly holding her for a few hours or overnight.

I only say this as someone who also had a rebellious phase. Speaking from my own experience a decade later, I don\u2019t believe that your approach will actually teach her the lesson you\u2019re hoping for. Instead, I think she\u2019s more likely to get involved with the wrong crowd. I also don\u2019t think she\u2019d view being detained as a consequence of her actions, but as a consequence of you. \n\nTake this route if that\u2019s what you feel you need to do, but I just thought I\u2019d try and give you another perspective.

It's a hard lesson to learn and maybe she'll think next time before she does anything stupid again.", "It\u2019s 50/50 with her. She probably won\u2019t learn anything either. Given that she doesn\u2019t listen to you two and therapy ain\u2019t working. She put herself on this destructive path", "I hope your wife takes you back to court and wins full custody over this manipulative and abusive behavior. YTA", "NTA", "EDIT: OP is divorced (I can see why). Everything else below stands. \n\nCongratulations. You\u2019ve ruined or significantly and long-term reduced the quality of your daughter\u2019s life, and most likely ruined your marriage, over $800 and relatively normal teenage rebellion. I hope you\u2019re happy dying alone. YTA.\n\nTo add more to this, there are really four issues here. \n\n1) Spending an extended period of time in juvenile detention will likely significantly harm your daughter. Since this is an obvious overreaction on your part, she will (justifiably, in my opinion) be angry the whole time and will be around a lot of other angry teenagers who have significantly less to lose than your daughter. This will be a real exposure to that kind of lifestyle for someone who is in a mindset to see merit in anger and escalation. She isn\u2019t going to meet people there who are dedicating themselves to be better after they leave detention. \n\n2) This will be on her record. Even if it is sealed or expunged, it will still come up in deep background checks. She probably won\u2019t be going to a normal high school, and will be behind on her education. \n\n3) You\u2019ve violated her trust. Even though she broke your trust first, there is an expectation that parents will protect their children. She is going through what sounds like a relatively bad, but not abnormal, teenage rebellion phase. This is a point in time where she really needs help from her parents showing compassion and guidance. She will either exit this phase of her life knowing what compassion and love can do when a person is hurting (she is hurting right now, which is why she\u2019s acting out) or she will exit this phase of her life learning that she can\u2019t rely on family or loved ones. What type of person do you want your daughter to become? This decision is bigger than anything else you have or could do as a parent, and will either reinforce any good, loving parenting you\u2019ve shown her in the past, or will destroy any past effort you\u2019ve made. Your decision.\n\n4) You\u2019ve betrayed your wife. Not only have you betrayed her trust in your, you\u2019ve negated all or much of the past effort that she has put into raising her daughter. \n\nI hope it\u2019s not too late for you to undo what you\u2019ve done. I hope so for your daughter\u2019s and wife\u2019s sake, as well as for your own, although I expect you\u2019ve already permanently damaged your own relationship with both of them no matter what happens now. I would never trust you again.", "Yes, YTA, and you have no idea what you've condemned your daughter to.\n\nShe's probably acting out because she knows you don't love her.", "YTA, this is gonna mess up your kids future, nontheless i find it super based xD.", "Nta if you don't stop now you don't stop never ever. It's not easy to be a father.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s the consequences of her actions.\n\nBut you are basically ending any hope of ever having a relationship with her again, so you need to decide if you want her to turn her life around, and maybe have a relationship with you again in the future, or send her to jail over $800", "Seriously, what country would put a teenager in juvenile prison for a year for stealing $800?

Your 16 year old doesn\u2019t need to go to jail for a year.", "OP, I hope this isn't true, but if it is, then it is extreme. She could have worked to give that money back to you. I know it is a lot of money, and stealing isn't okay, but she is your daughter. I don't condone what she did because it is fluffed up, but she is acting out for a reason. Therapy will only help if her environment is changing to the better, too. What is going on at your ex house? Are you working together in a healthy way for your child?\n\nSomewhere along the line, her behavior has been proven to be taught somewhere, and if your Ex hasn't been firm or you, of course, it will escalate.\nYou take her phone away. No driving with the car. No haning out with friends when she is at your house. \nThere are other stuff you could have done. You just made your daughter hate you more, and because she will be where she is, she will learn more of the bad stuff and won't learn a damn thing.\nShe will be traumatized too, because what I have heard, things happen in juvenile detention, and often it is sex crimes, so when she gets out, she will be a distant memory of herself.\n\nGreat parenting \ud83d\udc4d she is gonna resent you.", "YTA\n\nYou resorted to that because you don't even want to try to be a parent anymore.", "YTA. \n\nthey\u2019re right. she wont learn anything, other than the fact she is literally gonna hate you because you ruined her future in her eyes. yes she stole from you and that was wrong, getting her arrested was scary enough, but pressing charges on a teenager for a stupid mistake she made as a kid is gonna mess her up even more. dont press charges.", "Don't you think you escalated very fast on this?", "YTA\n\nYou are literally locking your daughter out of a number of future career paths with this.\n\nHonestly sounds like this girl grew up with a shit father, broken home. I doubt she stood a chance.\n\nJust having the police come, maybe a night in jail, maybe even community service if you hate your daughter.\n\nBut getting her sent to juvey for this? You are quite literally choosing to try and ruin her life", "YTA\n\nI agree what she did was terrible, and she needs a real intervention kinda moment, but a year in jail will only traumatize her. Being \"scared straight\" isn't really effective", "Something is missing from this story. For a first offense of a non-violent, low dollar crime as a minor, a year of juvy seems more than even a possible max sentence. Even a free public defender is gonna plea this down to a no juvy time deal. So does your daughter have a record?", "For $800 you saw fit to give your daughter a criminal record? Really?? You understand that her behavior & acting out speaks more about yours & your wife's parenting than it does about her, right? So you've doubled the damage and set her up for a more difficult future.", "Well you pretty much ruined all chances of a good relationship, her having a chance at college/good job  or moving abroad.

Is your daughter really worth less than $800 to you?", "YTA. You not only gave up on your literal child, but have chosen to permanently destroy her life.

It further traumatizes and disenfranchises people to the point where it is extremely difficult to ever really be able to participate in or contribute or even fully return to society (housing/homelessness, lack of job opportunities/upward mobility/hiring discrimination, poverty, food scarcity, lack of education, mental health, physical health, addiction, no voting, lack of support system).

Not when you\u2019re 16 and have finished puberty like most girls. She\u2019s well past the age now to know what she\u2019s doing is wrong and she\u2019s well past the age of petty theft. At this age she knows to communicate her emotions properly not take it out on others like a baby. But that\u2019s what she did when she stole from you.

She was fuming mad and nearly beat me there and then, screw the cops surrounding us. A few of the other parents came around, but these kids were problem children from a young age, and at this point, their parents just couldn't muster the energy to care anymore. \n\nMy mom told the police that she didn't want me charged or sent to juvenile, but that I needed to learn my lesson. So, they sentenced me to 75 hours of community service. The rest of the parents, like I said, couldn't muster the energy. They told the police to charge their kids.\n\nI was scared straight from that experience. I was sent to an animal rehabilitation center where I had to spend 5 hours a day, every day, cleaning out cages and pens and disgusting shit-filled water. After I was done with the 75 hours, I stayed a straight-laced kid until this day. Got a job, became a productive member of society, and have made my mom proud.\n\nThe people who went to juvie came back worse than ever. Two ran away from home and haven't been heard of since. One came out with a major addiction and spent his days fighting for his next fix with an army of underage minions to do his bidding. Another one joined him on his drug-fueled crusade until he was caught with one of the underaged minions and was tried as an adult for statutory rape. At some point, five years later, they found God and have repented their old ways, becoming missionaries.\n\nJuvenile will, more than likely, destroy your daughters future. Job prospects? Forget about it. Respect for the law? It'll become contempt for anyone in a position of power. Also, your relationship with her? Ruined and never recoverable.

She\u2019ll almost certainly suffer from PTSD. The kids I worked with in the system had committed violent offenses (and I don\u2019t think they deserved to be treated that way either). She\u2019ll be with peers who have harmed and abused others and who aren\u2019t receiving treatment for the underlying causes but instead being treated like they\u2019re worthless and less than human. As you might imagine, when someone hurts they lash out at others and your daughter will be an easy mark. Guards and other staff aren\u2019t much better. Some might be fine but others seek out positions like this because they get off on having absolute power and control. There\u2019s no greater control than as a CO over children (two most powerless groups of people are those incarcerated and children). Reports of sexual abuse perpetrated by guards run RAMPANT and are not usually investigated.
