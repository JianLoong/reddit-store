That was a terrible way to talk to someone who is exhibiting (annoying but not harmful) signs of mental illness. Also, there are going to be some people that have the same diagnosis as you but are more severely affected, so your diagnoses and level of functioning have nothing to do with theirs.

There was absolutely no need to speak to her like that.", "YTA. Not that you shouldn't have asked her to be quiet, but for the way you went about it. Starting rudely just makes you the AH, even when your words are justified.

I'll never understand why people go right to aggressively yelling at others instead of just having a conversation. \n\nI'm not saying that the problem wasn't annoying or that you didn't have a right to be irritated, but your response was pretty devoid of basic human compassion which imo means it was a AH move", "YTA The mentally ill woman didn\u2019t need \u201claid into\u201d and insulted.

I'm on meds and have a good support system. Not everyone can say that they are as lucky as me. If I had it over to do again I would have just finished my smoke popped another Ambien and gone back to bed.

Yes, it was hypocritical of you to be blunt towards her on account of your own mental health problems and therefore perhaps there was an opportunity for you to talk her out of her episode.

People with bipolar manic/depressive disorder cannot help those swings unless they are medicated and under a doctor\u2019s care.

I would want you as a neighbor", "Harsh yes. But she was also being ridiculous. Her mental health isn\u2019t the responsibility of the entire neighborhood.

And when they are like that it\u2019s not a manic episode that should be exposed to the general public. \n\nPeople are going to lament how you need to handle people with disorders with kid gloves. But, the FIRST thing you learn in rehabilitation and therapy is that you are responsible not everyone else\u2019s. Your triggers, your moods etc are your responsibility not everyone else\u2019s. And it\u2019s abusive to take them out on others especially if you\u2019re aware of the issues at hand. \n\nThat said. NTA.

She sucks for making a ruckus when people are trying to sleep, the neighbor sucks for yelling at her and dipping, and you suck because you are in a similar boat and lacked empathy.\n\nThat being said, her mental health issues are not yours to take care of or care about.
