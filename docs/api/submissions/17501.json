It's a woman having an argument with herself and I don't know who was winning but there were points being made by both people. My neighbor who works nights had just gone to bed an heard the commotion and open his door and said fuck off and have some respect! And then he shut his door. She came around the corner and all she saw was me and she asked why I was being mean. She was clearly having a manic episode and even though I myself am bipolar manic and have GAD I laid into her and said shut the fuck up and move on, people are trying to sleep. Immediately I felt like I had been an insensitive shit and wanted to say sorry but I didn't.  She ended up talking to herself as she walked away and I went back to bed but couldn't sleep.

That was a terrible way to talk to someone who is exhibiting (annoying but not harmful) signs of mental illness. Also, there are going to be some people that have the same diagnosis as you but are more severely affected, so your diagnoses and level of functioning have nothing to do with theirs. Also also, it sounds like she may have schizophrenia or something else and perhaps legit was not aware of what reality was at that moment. There was absolutely no need to speak to her like that.", "YTA. Not that you shouldn't have asked her to be quiet, but for the way you went about it. Starting rudely just makes you the AH, even when your words are justified. An \"excuse me, but people are trying to sleep, so can you keep it down?\" would have been a much better way to start the conversation. Then, if stronger language were needed, you could have escalated later.", "YTA, you literally could\u2019ve communicated the same thing but in a nice way.", "NTA", "NTA - You're a good neighbor", "YTA. Not for wanting her to be quiet, but for rudely barking  and swearing at her without even trying to talk to her like a person first. Would it have killed you to say \"hey its really early would you mind keeping it down?\" Before resorting to rudly cursing her out? \n\nThe other guy wasn't very nice either but at least he was doing it quickly out his door without actually seeing the issue you were right there in front of her able to talk normally and able to identify that this was a mental health issue. I'll never understand why people go right to aggressively yelling at others instead of just having a conversation. \n\nI'm not saying that the problem wasn't annoying or that you didn't have a right to be irritated, but your response was pretty devoid of basic human compassion which imo means it was a AH move", "YTA The mentally ill woman didn\u2019t need \u201claid into\u201d and insulted.

They asked you why you were being so mean, you could have explained and maybe diffused the situation. I get it and as someone who has a mental illness I would hate to be treated that way. But I have had the same reaction to a person aggravating me while in the psych ward myself. So ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Crying and screaming? Would you want to be told to shut the fuck up and move on? I\u2019m gonna go with ESH.

If I had it over to do again I would have just finished my smoke popped another Ambien and gone back to bed.

I am on a ton of meds for my mental health and I take responsibility to make sure they are filled and taken. I guess in the moment I thought well everyone should be like me.
