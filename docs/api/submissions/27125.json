{"id": 27125, "submission_id": "16lzdgr", "title": "AITA for humiliating my cousin in front of our family and kicking him out of the venue?", "selftext": "\nI got married on Saturday. My husband and me, we planned the wedding together over a span of 1 and a half years.\n\nWe wanted something special and had a lot of friends from overseas (England, Scotland, SA, Colombia, Argentina etc etc). We invited 83 people. Of those 32 were family and the rest friends.\n\nMy cousin brought his girl of 3 years. I do not know this woman very well. So I have neither anything against her nor do I like her. I am (was) indifferent.\n\nThe ceremony went by as planned. We cried. My parents cried. His parents cried. We had a little \"champagne\" reception before driving to the wedding venue. \n\nAnyway. Times goes by. We eat, do the toast. Photographer comes go me to inform me,  he saw cousins practicing a proposal. Me, not wanting to escalate shit, send my maid of honor to tell him that he shouldn't propose at my wedding. \n\nShe goes, tells him, and he seems to get it. \nUntil it was time to toss the bouquet.\nShe didn't even catch the damn thing. My Grammy did. But when I turned around, my cousin was walking towards his gf with another bouquet, tells her she is next, and goes on one knee to propose.\n\nMy family was cheering, and everyone else looked deeply uncomfortable. His gf cries and jumps, and my cousin turns around to (and I kid you not) tell the DJ to play \"their song\"\n\nBefore anything else could happen, I snatched the microphone and began giving a speech.\nI don't remember it fully. As I felt rage taking over. So here is the gist of it.\n\nBut I said something like \n\"Congratulations, Mike and random girl I have never seen. May your marriage be as selfish as what you have just done. I see you guys don't care about the happiness of anyone but yourself . Even after asking you not to do this, you decided what you wanted was more important. Random girl, I hope you didn't have any sort of boundaries that misaligned Mike's. Because he is gonna bulldoze  yours like he did with me. Mike is gonna do what Mike is gonna do. Fuck you Mike. Leave\"\n\nI was crying by that point I was sobbing. I informed venue security to escorte Mike and random girl out. \n\nWhen I came back, my aunt and other cousin were gone. \nI managed to enjoy the rest and after that we went on a little spa weekend. \n\nWhen we came back today I saw that our friends absolutely blasted Mike. But I also got a lot of messages saying, that I went to far humiliating him in front of strangers(by my family). I feel like I am swallowing crazy pills.\n\nAita ?", "created_utc": 1695052693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lzdgr/aita_for_humiliating_my_cousin_in_front_of_our/", "score": 1276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He brought this on himself the moment he decided he wanted to propose at your wedding and didn't ask you and your groom first.", "Weddings suck \ud83d\ude02 I just learned that this is a big no no. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna dump thousands of dollars to play dress up and get mad when things don\u2019t go my way.

God I am so sorry he did that to your wedding.", "When will people understand that the only parties/celebration it is ok to propose at is x-mas party, New Years Eve Party, or the intended's party. In other words, when the focus isn't on specific people other than the person that will be  proposed to.", "NTA\n\nYou told him specifically NOT to do this, and he stomped all over that boundary, even having the grandes cojones to tell the DJ to \"play our song\".\n\nYou had every right to be livid! Glad you called him out on it and humiliated him in front of everyone.\n\nFuck you, Mike. That was a Dick Move and you deserve to be dragged for it.", "Looks like I am in the minority here, but YTA.  What your cousin did was wrong, but you should not revel in humiliating him in front of friends and family.  Maybe lashing out against him felt good in the moment, but can you really be proud of the way you acted?  You made the situation worse rather than better.  Doling out humiliation is never a good look.\n\nThe AITA Reddit makes me realize just how much weddings bring out the worst in people!  It's  depressing--said by someone who got married years ago.", "NTA. When someone proposing wants to get married at a huge expensive looking event where all the focus is on them with everyone they know..... but they don't want to pay for that they decide to propose at someone's wedding.\n\nThat's the thing, in essence the more someone pays for a party/event the more the focus should be on them. $50 back yard bbq where people bring their own drinks, you can hardly complain if the focus is not on you, it's just the garden the party happens to be in. 20k+ party event, yeah the focus is on them, they paid for it to be so, you're an ass if you try to steal that attention.\n\nShould become a thing, you propose at a wedding you get charged 20% of the costs, that way either people are too cheap to do it or they get permission from bride/groom and chip in for the party to take some of the attention.", "there was an aita recently where this same thing happened, down to the dj having the song, the difference was the grooms did not do what you did. their whole wedding reception turned into an engagement party instead, and the grooms, if i remember right, left early. the speeches, the dinner arrangements, everything just went up in smoke before their eyes. their wedding was ruined. you managed to salvage yours. good for you. mike is not any kind of family to you, and humiliation is exactly what he deserved after what he did. nta.", "NTA. AndTHANK YOIU for what you did. You stood up to them and you are RIGHT to do so. Sorry they threw a wrinch into your happy wedding. Forget about them and enjoy life.

Good on you for the presence of spirit to make the speech. You didn\u2019t humiliate him. He humiliated himself.", "NTA - You gave Mike a fair warning and he decided to make your day all about him. Worst part is that he had the nerve to tell the DJ to play \"their song\" at your wedding. I would have wrapped the mic cord round his neck at that point.", "You're the narcissist.  Just like the 4 or 5 other narcissists every week who post about the trauma of not being the center of attention every fucking moment at their wedding reception.  Weddings used to be a celebration.  Judging by this sub, they are now staged events where narcissists wallow in being the center of everyfuckingbody's attention every fucking second of the whole fucking day.\n\nOne thing is for sure:  More people will remember your tantrum than any other event from that day.", "In the words William Shatner \u201cI admire your moxie\u201d. Definitely NOT THE AH.", "NTA but thanks for reminding me why weddings are insufferable. You were sobbing over this? It sounds like being robbed of joy due to sheer perfectionism attached to the wedding production. Mike was in the wrong but geez. In some other weddings, Mike's proposal would be annoying and stupid but not the end of the world and definitely no reason for a bride to be rage-sobbing. Your rage speech at Mike and his gf is what people are going to remember at the end of the day so, congratulations for enforcing strong boundaries, but was it worth this spat eclipsing your special day? If you were mad that he would draw people's attention from your wedding ceremony, that already happened, because people remember conflicts. \n It's not a theatre production that's going to be reviewed poorly due to a bad actor (Mike) improvising, and it's not going to ruin your career or your marriage. Believe it or not, people do talk about stuff other than the bride and groom at weddings. No one got drunk and started a brawl. No one was shot or molested. It sounds like it went fine other than Mike getting kicked out. Isn't there any margin of error when you do these events?", "NTA\n\nYou are my absolute HERO. It\u2019s so easy to freeze in that situation and let the jerk get away with it. Bravo!", "NTA \n\nForget the aholes blasting you.  Block them.  Your cousin is an asshole and deserves what you dished out.", "NTA he was selfish, and you rebuked him in a crowd of witnesses, and even warned her about his apparent lack of listening. There are times when couples allow a proposal for close friends or whatnot, but the majority of guests have no idea who these people are. Heck I've gone to weddings where I thought I knew a lot of people, and i did not know alot of people", "NTA. Fuck Mike. I feel sorry for his GF, but maybe this will be a wakeup call for her. Good job standing up for yourself. If you hadn't, the bitterness would have eaten at you, probably forever.", "you definitely went too far, but they're still the bigger assholes.", "NTA- I love this for you and I\u2019m sorry that they did that on your special day. You had every right to be pissed. Ignore all the negative people because they didn\u2019t spend more than a year planning for this once in a lifetime special day. Fuck mike", "NTA and I wish I could have seen this. Sounds like something out of a comedy movie lol", "NTA. He proposed in front of everyone and got told off in front of everyone. He knew what he was going to do was rude, and you specifically didn't want it.", "NTA. \nHowever, you may have sullied the memory of your wedding to get your(well earned) revenge. \nWhile moronic Mike and his girl deserved what they got, you deserved better.", "NTA..... Bill them for a % of the DJ/venue hire/food, etc. Especially because they attempted to utilise your money/wedding as an engagement party.\n\nIf he wanted to propose somewhere beautiful, he should have put his hand in his pocket and organised his own separate event instead of attempting to steam roll yours.", "You are NTA, you're the legend", "NTA.  May you have children whose gonads are as big as yours.\n\nThis is the way.", "NTA...but might I suggest a pregnancy announcement at their wedding? lol", "I'm in awe of you to be honest lol   I wish I had your guts.", "NTA. You made the repercussion as loud and public as his disrespect.", "You probably won't be invited to their wedding but if can can convince someone that is on your side to announce their pregnancy at their wedding.

Photographer comes go me to inform me, he saw cousins practicing a proposal. Me, not wanting to escalate shit, send my maid of honor to tell him that he shouldn't propose at my wedding. \n\nWhy? Why not? \n\nWhat is it with people on reddit (Americans?) and insisting to the death that their wedding must be only about them and can't include ANYTHING that even has the potential to slightly distract from them? The horror of people remembering a cute engagement when they think back on your wedding party. \n\n>  I see you guys don't care about the happiness of anyone but yourself .\n\nBecause they (actually just he) dared to make a proposal at YOUR party? How is that not a giant asshole thing to say in front of a room full of your friends and family?", "NTA you were awesome!", "NTA.  You specifically said not to do this and he did it anyway.  He caused the humiliation by trying to make your wedding an event for him.  To anyone continuing to give you grief, simply say \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" and then change the subject.", "NTA", "NTA, but you sure give off asshole vibes even when you're right.", "ESH except the gf.  You were mad at cousin Mike but you publicly debased his gf. I understand it\u2019s considered bad taste to propose at a wedding, even worse when you warned him not to. It would not bother me to see a proposal, wedding guests already know you are the star of day and have \u201ccelebrated\u201d you for hours.  The uncomfortable part for me as a guest would be listening to your speech. You made a spectacle, your speech sounds corny as hell and you cried your eyes out.  Good job taking the attention back and enjoy the magic memories of when you also did not care about the happiness of anyone but yourself and called the gf of 3 years a rando.  That\u2019s how your wedding will be remembered.", "F Mike AND the rest of your family....they're selfish jackasses.", "Nta you don't propose in weddings", "He interrupted your wedding and I wish that he didn\u2019t and you spoke out of emotion that was understandable.\n\nWe can\u2019t undo the past but would it have been better to make a toast to your husband and or family for supporting you and ignoring them and their behavior\u2026. Yes. Still ask them to leave privately yes. But he shouldn\u2019t have done it. So you did what you could do in a moment notice. Your behavior and emotions were reasonable.", "NTA....SO NOT THE AH.  He wanted to do something, was told not to do it, and decided to hijack your wedding for his proposal. Great speech, great action, and block ANYONE who thinks what he did is ok. \n\nCongratulations!", "NTA, I am GLAD you tore him a new one!!", "NTA - Once he was told you did not approve,  he became the AH... You had every right to be mad, and I applaud you for standing up to a bully and tainting his proposal.

My husband and me, we planned the wedding together over a span of 1 and a half years.\n\nWe wanted something special and had a lot of friends from overseas (England, Scotland, SA, Colombia, Argentina etc etc). We invited 83 people. Of those 32 were family and the rest friends.\n\nMy cousin brought his girl of 3 years. I do not know this woman very well. So I have neither anything against her nor do I like her. I am (was) indifferent.\n\nThe ceremony went by as planned. We cried. My parents cried. His parents cried. We had a little \"champagne\" reception before driving to the wedding venue. \n\nAnyway. Times goes by. We eat, do the toast. Photographer comes go me to inform me,  he saw cousins practicing a proposal. Me, not wanting to escalate shit, send my maid of honor to tell him that he shouldn't propose at my wedding. \n\nShe goes, tells him, and he seems to get it. \nUntil it was time to toss the bouquet.\nShe didn't even catch the damn thing. My Grammy did. But when I turned around, my cousin was walking towards his gf with another bouquet, tells her she is next, and goes on one knee to propose.\n\nMy family was cheering, and everyone else looked deeply uncomfortable. His gf cries and jumps, and my cousin turns around to (and I kid you not) tell the DJ to play \"their song\"\n\nBefore anything else could happen, I snatched the microphone and began giving a speech.\nI don't remember it fully. As I felt rage taking over. So here is the gist of it.\n\nBut I said something like \n\"Congratulations, Mike and random girl I have never seen. May your marriage be as selfish as what you have just done. I see you guys don't care about the happiness of anyone but yourself . Even after asking you not to do this, you decided what you wanted was more important. Random girl, I hope you didn't have any sort of boundaries that misaligned Mike's. Because he is gonna bulldoze  yours like he did with me. Mike is gonna do what Mike is gonna do. Fuck you Mike. Leave\"\n\nI was crying by that point I was sobbing. I informed venue security to escorte Mike and random girl out. \n\nWhen I came back, my aunt and other cousin were gone. \nI managed to enjoy the rest and after that we went on a little spa weekend. \n\nWhen we came back today I saw that our friends absolutely blasted Mike. But I also got a lot of messages saying, that I went to far humiliating him in front of strangers(by my family). I feel like I am swallowing crazy pills.\n\nAita ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No matter the excuse and arguments from family, Cousin Mike was warned and Cousin Mike is paying the consequences of his actions. He is not the victim here", "NTA - everyone knows you don't propose at someone else's wedding- If Mike didn't want to be blasted, maybe he shouldn't have stolen the spotlight from someone else", "NTA first off, he did not ask to do this. that is very disrespectful. you are using someone else special day and turning into your own do that on your own time and with your own ideas.

Wait for his wedding. At his wedding, right after some significant moment (maybe after the couple's first dance), tell the DJ you have a little speech prepared. Act like you're going to toast the happy couple. Use that moment to announce that you and your husband wanted to share in their happiness by letting them know that THEY WILL SOON BE AN UNCLE AND AUNT and announcing that you are pregnant! You have to commit to the whole bit, and act like you're trying to make the moment about them. (It wouldn't even matter if you weren't really pregnant; if you weren't you could tell everyone in a couple of weeks about how devastated you were to have suffered a miscarriage.)\n\nThen there's no question about who's the AH at your wedding. He can't claim you're an AH for stealing his thunder on his wedding day without admitting his own assholery on your day.

Fuck you Mike!", "NTA. It's rude enough proposing at someone else's wedding, to be asked specifically not to and then doing it anyway is incredibly selfish.
