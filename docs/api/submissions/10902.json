Someone will always have an opinion regardless of what you do. \n\n- we did the same for our wedding (except I wore a tea length wedding dress and he wore a suit) but guess had no dress code. You want to wear khakis and a button up, go for it. Tye dye sundress, you do you. Initially it gave some anxiety but after a few yup thats good, people settled in. It also made the wedding easier because people were more relaxed and enjoyed themselves.

Best wishes to you and your new spouse!", "NTA maybe your guests need a reminder that the dress code is just a heads-up, not an enforced rule or something. If they want to dress formally and risk feeling overdressed, that's on them. Maybe like \"I'll be in a sun dress and he'll be in a Hawaiian shirt. The reception will consist of beer, lemonade, and barbecue, and we might run some sprinklers for the kids and dogs at some point if it's hot. So, take that as you will!\"\n\nThis sounds like a genuinely awesome, fun wedding that all your cousins will be secretly envious of. Don't worry about the complainers. They'd always find something to hate.", "NTA.", "The wedding is yours, you gave freedom to everyone to wear whatever they want. But , you break the usual traditions of a wedding where the wife and the husband dress up as a princess and a prince, which shows that you don't care about the ceremony and feel like it's unimportant. In the end, it's your wedding, but close people won't like it. NTA.", "NTA, you are totally doing the right thing, this will be one wedding where everyone can enjoy themselves.

Your wedding, your decision.  If that's what makes you and your fiance happy, then you do it that way.  No one has the right to make you comply with a formal dress code.

We wore our mix matched college football hoodies of my husband's favorite team & nice jeans. Granted we just went to the courthouse but still it was our wedding.

I was sweating so much.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, celebrate how you want to! It\u2019s not about what other people want. You shouldn\u2019t even have to justify it about the reasons why.

Do it how you want and forget everything else. If anything this will help make this more memorable for the guests. \n\nOn top of that, the wedding is so unimportant in the long run.

Congratulations! Hope your wedding is wonderful", "Honestly, I think the whole wedding \"dress code\" thing is insipid and overdone. People know how to address for weddings and special occasions.

Thats a them problem. \n\nStart your life together happy.\n\nCongratulations!", "NTA \n\nBut if a formal dress code is what makes a wedding \u201cserious\u201d (or not a joke) then I guess it\u2019s clear what happened to the boomers.", "NTA\n\nYOUR wedding.

You're encouraging people to dress casually but aren't requiring it.\n\nHaving been born back in the Pleistocene (or so it feels some days), I still have the outlook that a wedding and reception are supposed to be a celebration of a marriage, not a heavily-scripted, 2-part pageant.

NTA - your wedding is for you both - the only thing I\u2019d say is imagine yourself looking at the pictures in 20 years\u2019 time - would you still be happy? I said the same to the couple who wanted a nudist wedding - you might want to specify \u201csome\u201d clothing in case you have \u201dedgy\u201d friends!"]}
