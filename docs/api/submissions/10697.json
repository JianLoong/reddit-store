I just recently brought up the idea to my father who has multiple properties and since he\u2019s going into retirement, i thought it was the perfect time to slide the idea of me buying his property. At the moment i brought it up , there was renters in but recently their contact has ended. Just last week i had sat my parents down and told them that i wanted to buy the property and in my opinion i thought it went well with them agreeing and telling me it\u2019s a big step. So here comes the problem, my oldest sister (27) is currently roommates with one of our cousins due to the fact that she didn\u2019t like the rules my parents set on their house. I called my sister that night and told her the future family get togethers we can all have and she was ecstatic for me. the next day my sister comes over and says she has to tell me something. \u201cMom and dad are letting me rent the G**** O**** house !\u201d as soon as that come out her mouth my stomach had dropped and multiple months of hard work in savings had went down the drain. Yeah of course i can just move into another house and not whine about it but growing up i\u2019ve always helped my father make that small house become prettier and prettier each and every year. Helping him rip out the flooring to upgrade it, giving him ideas for renovations and etc. Just basically building a beautiful house from scratch with my father. So after the confrontation, i went straight to my mother for questioning. My mother immediately threw my idea to the floor and for her reasoning was \u201cOh your sisters older and needs a good home to start her own family ! i\u2019m sure you get it. You\u2019re young , why rush out of our house ?\u201d hearing those words completely crushed me and made me feel like my hard work was for nothing and completely jealousy took over as i watched my sister move her messy life into my dream home. Since then i\u2019ve been ignoring my mothers and sisters calls and texts. I\u2019ve been working doubles just to avoid my parents and even started dashing at night just to not think about it. My brother tells me im a asshole for making my sister feel guilt and my mom feel like a bad person and i know i should be an adult about it but i can\u2019t help to feel sad and jealous about it. My father claims my mother told him that i backed out on buying the property which makes this situation even more messy and idk what to do or feel.

It sounds as though your mother and sister conspired to get your sister what she wanted despite her poor life choices... you have every right to be angry. They have acted disgracefully. I hope you told your father your mother lied and you didn't back out.", "NTA, feel free to tell your Dad he was lied to.\n\nYou have every right to feel what you\u2019re feeling is grief, you put your heart and soul into that house to be ripped away by a lie, and you mom and sister it seems will not own up to what they did. It will take time for you to move on, but you have every right to go no contact with them if you choose to.", "NTA. Your mother lied and went back on her word. I wouldn\u2019t talk to either of them for a very long time. \n\nI know of sucks but there\u2019s other properties out there. I\u2019d find one that isn\u2019t tied to your family and work to make it into your dream home.

If your mother and sister have done nothing wrong, they shouldn't feel bad about it.", "NTA - your parents made a deal with you and then change of plans without even notifying you. That is a very AH move. And your sister, knowing your plans went behind your back to request the house to your parents, looks like she is self-centered.\n\nThe best you can do is take your time to process all the feelings that this betray has cause you, you dont own them anything so you can contact back when you feel it.\n\nMost importantly, your hard work is not worthless, you still have the money and the motivation. Use all your energy to build a new plan that doesn't involve your family and only talk to them (if you want to) when everything is done.\nYou can achieve big things with the discipline and hard work you have at that young age.", "NTA. Honestly, with the manipulation and lying you are better off remaining no and low contact with them. Tell father that mother and sister are dirty cheat liars, and refuse to have anything to do with them in the future until they make this right.", "Your mother even lied to your father? Wow shame on her , I would ask what your father says about this but your last phrase gives the answer. NTA shame on your mother, it's mostly her fault and then the sister's.", "NTA.\n\nI'd send them a message to your parents asking for a sit down. \n\nTell them you're hurt about the situation. You'd made a verbal agreement. Then they give it to your sister, fine its their property. You have the right to be disappointed. Then you need to address your mum lying. Tell her you're upset that she did this. She needs to explain where she heard this from. \n\nTake your time before making any decisions, but maybe start looking for another place to buy.", "NTA. You had an agreement and you trusted them because they are family and yet they betrayed you.", "NTA-you\u2019re always allowed to have your feelings, and you\u2019re allowed to spend time with whomever you wish. Just leave it where it is though. Don\u2019t discuss further. Don\u2019t get into an argument with your sister or your mother. Be sure to treat them with respect. They suck, you know that clearly now. Keep them at arms length, but don\u2019t stoop to their level. Buy another home-look hard for something you would really appreciate, (maybe even something that you and your dad can work on together) to help alleviate the pain of watching all your hard work ignored and your mother\u2019s favoritism. \n\nHave a private conversation with your father letting him know that you\u2019re feeling backstabbed but will do your best to get over it. It might just take a while. In the meantime, you want him to know that when the arrangement with your sister ends, that you do want to be told (from him because you don\u2019t plan on spending much time with your backstabbing sister) so you can then decide what you want to do. \n\nI suspect your father will fix this for you one day.

As you said your parents have some other properties too; can sister move to one of those?", "Your Parents are huge A H, you're not OP. They broke the trust, you talked with them before this. Your sister was jealous and couldn't let you have something. The age argument is stupid because they had no issue selling it to you before and I'm curious if your mom really told your dad you backed out. It's like your mom and sister planned this together. \n\nIs she always more caring about your sister?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nWas there ever any talk about her moving into that house? No? Then it's a classical case of a sibling taking something they don't even want just so the other one can't have it.", "NTA\n\nNot if sister and Mum are manipulative like that. Go to your father (just your father) and tell him what happened and why your so upset. Be clear and COMMUNICATE. It's the only way to deal with the lies. Be prepared to gain no traction and start looking to be absolutely independent.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you learned this lesson the hard way but it\u2019s an important one: no one will f*** you over harder and faster than family. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s true, but it is. Maybe because family expects you to sacrifice for them in a way that strangers won\u2019t, or they assume that you\u2019ll forgive and forget.\n\nForgiving and forgetting is NOT the way to go here. If you let it go, they will use what they did to you as a model for every future transaction - your sister have a right of first refusal on anything you seek for yourself and you\u2019ll be expected to let it go and be happy for her. Family dynamics become etched in stone very easily and if you give an inch on this, your role will always be to give up what you want for your sister. \n\nRefuse any contact with your mother and sister as long as your sister is in that house. Never tell your sister anything about your business or your wants and dreams because she will snatch them out from under you. Tell your father what your mother did, but don\u2019t trust him to be on your side - he wasn\u2019t looking out for you when he believed your mother and didn\u2019t bother talking to you before he rented the house to your sister. Tell your brother that your sister should feel guilty ( r she\u2019s she\u2019s a thief) and your mom should feel like a bad person (because she is) and to never bring them up with you again unless he wants you to go no contact with him too.\n\nFind your own place. Don\u2019t include your family in it at all. Make them earn your trust and give it to them sparingly. All of this sounds harsh and unforgiving, but that\u2019s the only way to protect yourself when family decides that what\u2019s theirs is theirs and what\u2019s yours is theirs too.", "If they agreed, then they went back on their word and it's worse because your mother lied to your father about the situation to favour your sister. I would also be quite upset if a house I thought was agreed to be mine was suddenly taken away from me. \n\n\nI don't think you're the AH in this situation, but if you want a relationship with your parents and sibling, you might have to be the bigger person here.", "Well it\u2019s messy. I absolutely understand your feelings. They can do with their property whatever they want, as you didn\u2019t sign a contract or whatever, but it still feels like a betrayal, because you agreed on something, then went behind your back.\nNTA, your mother and sister is, however. The timing makes them TA, and also because your mother went behind your back, and lied to your father\u2026 Well, now you know who\u2019s your mothers favorite child. I\u2019d hold a grudge too.", "NTA, but you do need to communicate with your parents, and especially your dad, what that house means to you, and how you were still planning on buying it. You need to communicate how being cut off from the property made you feel as their daughter and how your sister being given it from right under you made you feel. Most important, it must be done tactfully. \n\nIf they don\u2019t consider any of your feelings as important, then you know where you fall in importance to them. Dont be afraid to go NC after bc this could end up real toxic and you deserve better. Sometimes we have to cut family out of our life bc of their actions.", "NTA\n\n\nYou might be a tat overdramatic but generally it is really unfair and especially as their seem to have more than one property this also unnessary.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut why are you holding a grudge against your mom and not against your dad. They decided this together.", "NTA, especially as your family seems to be trying to put it behind them in a \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d kind of way. It\u2019s *not* done.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you are, but I bet that the law would allow them to make a tenant move if the property is being sold. If so, that means this situation could be fixed anytime. So every day they don\u2019t fix it is another day they are choosing to wrong you.", "NTA. your sister SHOULD feel guilty for the shit she pulled. your mother IS a bad person, for making you a promise and welching on it immediately, same with your father who also made a promise to you (Edited to add: missed in my first read that your mother lied to him too, which makes her twice the AH. TELL YOUR DAD.)  \nDid your brother get lied to and betrayed by your mother and sister too? No? then he can STFU. What a bunch of AHs.", "NTA.  Your mom and sis are MAJOR AHs though.\n\nI would start looking for homes, maybe you can find one that appeals to you. Then start YOUR life!", "NTA\n\nYour sister is your mom's favorite, and your mom couldn't stand you achieving something before her. So they conspired to screw you over. Your brother just parrots their BS.\n\nI'm just curious if your dad is going to let it all go through, knowing the deception.  If so, then OP, it's time to move on from the whole idea and brand out on your own. Your efforts deserve more recognition  and quite frankly, your family is pretty crappy.\n\nEdited to add: it's not jealousy to be mad that you got screwed over. If any of them say that, they're manipulating you into thinking you're the bad guy.", "> OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n> 1. holding a strong grudge against my mother and sister due to my jealousy \n2. it made my sister and mother feel guilty and bad\n\n\nYou might be feeling somewhat jealous, but the overriding emotion is betrayal.

And that hurt this causes might even steer you further away from your family. \n\nAnd since you made yourself a nest egg that you do not have possibility to put down on your dream house, maybe you should use that for something else at this time, maybe something for yourself?

Keep saving your money and get a place away from the family.  Tell brother to shut up, not his business.  Tell mom she\u2019s certainly showing who her favorite is and block all of them.

Sure, if your mother simply flaked it would be reason enough to be mad over long, but your mother outright lied about you because she favours your sister.

Make sure that your dad knows they lied. I think you should just block Mom and Sister for now.", "What they did was absolutely shit, and they shouldn\u2019t have made promises or at the very least discussed properly why they changed their mind rather than lying. But I actually think it\u2019s the timing rather than them trying to just take what OP wants for the hell of it. The tenants left so now that property is free. Either to be sold or used. OP\u2019s mom unilaterally decided that a better use was to move her daughter there rather than sell it to OP. I\u2019m guessing so that the daughter had her own place to move to rather than living with the cousin in a roommate situation. In her view, OP already has a home with the family and doesn\u2019t need it as much as the sister who isn\u2019t living under their roof. So now she has sister back under a property she owns and OP isn\u2019t worse off (in her opinion). Isn\u2019t that so nice for mommy that she now has both her kids under a roof she owns? /s\n\nI think OP should take this as a blessing because these are exactly the kind of family that doesn\u2019t respect sales to other family members. They\u2019d probably try to exert control anyways. I really hope they don\u2019t give up on buying and try buying from someone they aren\u2019t related to."]}
