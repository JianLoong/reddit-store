Just last week i had sat my parents down and told them that i wanted to buy the property and in my opinion i thought it went well with them agreeing and telling me it\u2019s a big step.

Helping him rip out the flooring to upgrade it, giving him ideas for renovations and etc. Just basically building a beautiful house from scratch with my father.

Just leave it where it is though. Don\u2019t discuss further. Don\u2019t get into an argument with your sister or your mother. Be sure to treat them with respect. They suck, you know that clearly now. Keep them at arms length, but don\u2019t stoop to their level. Buy another home-look hard for something you would really appreciate, (maybe even something that you and your dad can work on together) to help alleviate the pain of watching all your hard work ignored and your mother\u2019s favoritism. \n\nHave a private conversation with your father letting him know that you\u2019re feeling backstabbed but will do your best to get over it. It might just take a while. In the meantime, you want him to know that when the arrangement with your sister ends, that you do want to be told (from him because you don\u2019t plan on spending much time with your backstabbing sister) so you can then decide what you want to do. \n\nI suspect your father will fix this for you one day.

It's like your mom and sister planned this together. \n\nIs she always more caring about your sister?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nWas there ever any talk about her moving into that house? No? Then it's a classical case of a sibling taking something they don't even want just so the other one can't have it.", "NTA\n\nNot if sister and Mum are manipulative like that.

Be prepared to gain no traction and start looking to be absolutely independent.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you learned this lesson the hard way but it\u2019s an important one: no one will f*** you over harder and faster than family. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s true, but it is. Maybe because family expects you to sacrifice for them in a way that strangers won\u2019t, or they assume that you\u2019ll forgive and forget.\n\nForgiving and forgetting is NOT the way to go here. If you let it go, they will use what they did to you as a model for every future transaction - your sister have a right of first refusal on anything you seek for yourself and you\u2019ll be expected to let it go and be happy for her. Family dynamics become etched in stone very easily and if you give an inch on this, your role will always be to give up what you want for your sister. \n\nRefuse any contact with your mother and sister as long as your sister is in that house. Never tell your sister anything about your business or your wants and dreams because she will snatch them out from under you. Tell your father what your mother did, but don\u2019t trust him to be on your side - he wasn\u2019t looking out for you when he believed your mother and didn\u2019t bother talking to you before he rented the house to your sister. Tell your brother that your sister should feel guilty ( r she\u2019s she\u2019s a thief) and your mom should feel like a bad person (because she is) and to never bring them up with you again unless he wants you to go no contact with him too.\n\nFind your own place. Don\u2019t include your family in it at all. Make them earn your trust and give it to them sparingly. All of this sounds harsh and unforgiving, but that\u2019s the only way to protect yourself when family decides that what\u2019s theirs is theirs and what\u2019s yours is theirs too.", "If they agreed, then they went back on their word and it's worse because your mother lied to your father about the situation to favour your sister. I would also be quite upset if a house I thought was agreed to be mine was suddenly taken away from me. \n\n\nI don't think you're the AH in this situation, but if you want a relationship with your parents and sibling, you might have to be the bigger person here.", "Well it\u2019s messy.

The timing makes them TA, and also because your mother went behind your back, and lied to your father\u2026 Well, now you know who\u2019s your mothers favorite child. I\u2019d hold a grudge too.", "NTA, but you do need to communicate with your parents, and especially your dad, what that house means to you, and how you were still planning on buying it. You need to communicate how being cut off from the property made you feel as their daughter and how your sister being given it from right under you made you feel. Most important, it must be done tactfully. \n\nIf they don\u2019t consider any of your feelings as important, then you know where you fall in importance to them. Dont be afraid to go NC after bc this could end up real toxic and you deserve better. Sometimes we have to cut family out of our life bc of their actions.", "NTA\n\n\nYou might be a tat overdramatic but generally it is really unfair and especially as their seem to have more than one property this also unnessary.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut why are you holding a grudge against your mom and not against your dad. They decided this together.", "NTA, especially as your family seems to be trying to put it behind them in a \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d kind of way. It\u2019s *not* done.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you are, but I bet that the law would allow them to make a tenant move if the property is being sold. If so, that means this situation could be fixed anytime.

If so, then OP, it's time to move on from the whole idea and brand out on your own.

OP\u2019s mom unilaterally decided that a better use was to move her daughter there rather than sell it to OP. I\u2019m guessing so that the daughter had her own place to move to rather than living with the cousin in a roommate situation. In her view, OP already has a home with the family and doesn\u2019t need it as much as the sister who isn\u2019t living under their roof.

Isn\u2019t that so nice for mommy that she now has both her kids under a roof she owns? /s\n\nI think OP should take this as a blessing because these are exactly the kind of family that doesn\u2019t respect sales to other family members.

Your father and mother and sister should make it right to you by having sister move out to another one of the properties. And father should have a stern talking to with mother on the lies, but I get the feeling that this is not the first time something like this has happened.", "NTA- Just keep saving your money and buy your own place. You can do it! You don't need their help.\n\nPs- Don't let your sister move in though.", "Your mom screwed you over for the golden child. I'd be mad too. NTA", "NTA at all!\n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. But you learned some valuable lessons\u2026namely, that your sister can\u2019t be trusted to not put her interests above yours. She totally threw you under the bus.\n\nYour brother is a shit stirrer and has no dog in this fight.\n\nSounds like your mom picked the child who she felt had the greatest need and that superseded any prior agreements. And maybe she is even willing to lie to your father for what she sees as a child\u2019s better interest.\n\nNow your dad, maybe he knew and maybe he didn\u2019t. Either your mom lied to him or your dad felt very guilty in the moment and blamed your mom\u2026\u201dWell, your mom said\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat is your dad doing to right the situation now? If he is doing nothing than I kind of think he knew a lot more than he is letting on, and regardless, he certainly knows now. For example, he could give your sister 12 months to get herself together with the understanding that if you are still interested, that you will purchase the house at that time.\n\nI think all of this warrants further conversation.\n\nETA: Just some friendly advice, on your next deal, don\u2019t say a word to anyone until the papers are signed! And especially don\u2019t share with your family, but it could also be friends, significant partner\u2019s family, business associate, etc.", "NTA but it\u2019s time to move out and start building your own dream house. What they did was horrible. Do not listen to your brother if they didn\u2019t know what they where doing was screwing you over then they would not feel guilty. You are being more gracious then most would be.\n\nSo start looking for a place you can work on while living there. Start building your own dream house no one can steal from you. And go low contact with your mother and sister. It\u2019s obvious who your mothers favorite is. Your dad should be livid with being lied too. They manipulated him and screwed you over. And I am sure this is not the first time your sister and mother has screwed you over.", "NTA. Why didn't your dad confirm with you directly that you had changed your mind? That's so odd.\n\nKeep saving, don't burn yourself out though. When you have drive like you have, and with your savings, you'll be able to pounce on the next great opportunity. Maybe your dad can help you find your next property.", "NTA;  Your mother is a bad person and you need to remember you father's complicity in this bait switch after you worked on it with them.  Your anger is real and you can choose if or when to let go or forgive.", "NTA Your brother is wrong, they should feel bad about it. But you have learnt a valuable lesson in who you can trust. Work hard and find your own place not connected with them in any way.", " and multiple months of hard work in savings had went down the drain.\n\nWhy?\n\nHow did you lose your money when you weren't sold property you're not entitled to.\n\nBut I understand your frustration, especially since you've been making improvements to that house. \n\nBut the house has not been sold. And as you said, you're not entitled to buying it. It's still there waiting for you when the right time comes... but I don't think that's going to come because your parents will keep your sister living there - because she needs it more than you.\n\nWhich leaves you NTA and without a house to buy. \n\nWhich is why you're going to keep on saving money living FOR FREE with your parents until you can buy a fixer-upper which you will buy and remodel with your father, creating equity while at it.\n\nIf you bought your parents house you'd never hear the end of it from your sister, it would create drama. You are better off buying something fresh to make your own. Maybe some day the other house will be yours, that is not out the window, it's just on delay.\n\nAdjust and move on. And please don't use hyperbolic language like your savings or efforts have gone down the drain, they haven't and you know it.", "Well put, NTA.", "> It could be time to get everyone in a room to clear the air and for everyone to be honest.\n\nI disagree with this part. They've shown their colors, what good is a round of gaslighting and ganging up on OP going to do? That's what is going to happen. \n\nOP needs to keep focusing on themselves, get out, and put some distance between them and their family.", "Father's lying too.  Why wouldn't he talk to his own daughter about her supposed change in plans?  He knew, he's just trying to blame the mom.", "I suppose they have one of those toxic family dynamics where abuse is tolerated,", "I know it sucks but there's other people out there. I'd find one that isn't tied to your family and make it your dream home. It won't have have the years behind it but I bet you could still build something beautiful with people who aren't backstabbers and liars", "And investing your time in other relationships", "I would consider this a silver lining because frankly very few financial transactions with family end without someone getting shafted. OP needs to find a place away from home and with perfect strangers who, no doubt, will treat him with more respect and candor. It might seem like that house was \"the one\" but sometimes it isn't meant to be and actually can be a blessing - who knows what kind of problems OP has dodged here. NTA.", "Bingo, dad makes mom the bad guy but he knows that of course they'll lend the house to the kid who needs it more **at this point.**\n\nOP is much better off buying a fixer-upper and forcing dad to help remodel to repay the work OP put into their own home (repay? wasn't that fair contribution for living there for free though? I'd think so. )\n\nBuying that house, OP and the parents would never hear the end of it from sis. It would create so much drama, as it has done already.  Best get a place that's your own from the very beginning, then sis can lay no claim to it later.", "If sister can\u2019t pay for shelter, she shouldn\u2019t be having a family.", "I agree dad is just as guilty. Most men who have been manipulated like this and made to look like a lier would have slammed on the breaks of this planned. Told mom she had no right to play favorites and manipulate him into showing favoritism and told dear sister not to be packing cause the offer to rent is no longer there. That he doesn\u2019t reward conniving manipulative behavior."]}
