Your wife didn\u2019t say it was wrong or that she wanted anyone to do anything she only expressed her feelings. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with her feelings and she SHOULD be able to talk to you about then without you getting so hostile. Your wife literally has nothing to apologize for she just express natural sadness of her child becoming more independent of her/closer to other parent. She didn\u2019t say it was wrong or say it needed to be changed.\n\nYou need to get over yourself Jesus dude your wife literally didn\u2019t do anything", "Yes, you're an asshole. \n\nYour wife came to you with an emotional problem. You actually vowed to be there for her through such things. You, however, were so bitter that one of your *other* children was closer to her that instead of just listening, you decided to guilt her and call her a hypocrite.\n\nIronically you are carrying a grievance about another child not being close to you, so to critique *her* for doing something you yourself are doing is absurdly hypocritical. \n\nIf you did not turn this into a competition, you and her could have a united front, and if you wanted to spend more time with a child closer to her, you could talk openly with her about it and you guys could arrange that. But by turning the entire thing into a \"who loves who more\" competition, you preclude any possibility of that and, ironically, you create an environment in which kids will feel inclined to \"choose\" a parent (after all, one parent will *always* be upset) and where there's no possibility of rectifying that. Also, if your parents are a united front it's very hard to be more attached to one of them - they come as a unit, and are sharing all responsibilities, so there's really no criteria upon which a child can form a preference.", "YTA. It's one thing if a child has a favourite parent, it's another to not want anything to do with one parent. Your wife just seems to want a relationship with all four of her children and I don't see a problem with that.", "Maybe she just wanted to be close with him too.", "YTA. All she said was that she feels sad and you started interrogating her about her feelings. I think it's a pretty normal thing to feel sad about, you could have just consoled her rather than giving her a weird hypothetical. She probably gave you attitude because you made it in to some weird competition as soon as she brought up her feelings. The fact that you keep a tally of which kid likes which kid better is kind of strange. I get that kids tend to be closer to one parent than the other, but you seem weirdly fixated on it.", "YTA\n\n>She said that breaks her heart and I asked her what breaks her heart? That our son is closer to me than her?\n\nWhy can't she share these feeling with you without you feeling blamed or upset? She is sad she isn't closer to her son and he is rejecting her. That is a normal feeling and all you had to do here is be understanding and ask if she wants help. If she does then both can think of ways for her to bond with the child \n\n>I asked her if she'd be okay with having our 7yo being close with her and not me.\n\nWhy would you ask that? She is desperate for a connection and extremely sad and this question doesn't seem to help anyone.\n\n\n\nShe isn't jealous. She is **sad**. She doesn't blame you, she just wanted to share and talk about her feeling with her husband. Could she want some help from you? Maybe, but that would come after.", "YTA and the one overreacting. It sounds like she was just expressing sadness. All you had to do was say, \u201cI hear you. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a stage.\u201d Instead, you turned it into a fight.", "YTA. I barely understood a word of this, but you sound unpleasant to be around.", "You have such bitterness and resentment towards your wife it\u2019s like poison ouzing out of your post and your comments really cements that you have turned this into some sort of weird war on her. \n\nYTA. Get therapy.", "YTA. Sweet Jesus, heaven forbid she expresses how she feels to her husband. She wasn't attacking or criticising you; your response was absurd.", "YTA you need therapy. You jumped to aggression and defensiveness when you\u2019re wife told you she was upset. You are clearly bitter about the relationship you have with your 16year old that you\u2019ve become possessive of the relationship with 7 year old. You\u2019re supposed to be a partnership but when your wife told you she was upset you turned it into an aggressive accusation and because she didn\u2019t respond you think that confirms it? \n\nYou turned what would have been you comforting your wife for feeling down into an argument then blamed her for having feelings about it? Do you want her to be able to talk about her feelings with you? Because she won\u2019t with that kind of aggressive argumentative response. Kids go through stages, they sometimes cling to one parent or another. The correct response would be \u201coh baby you know 7 year old loves you, they go through stages you know what it\u2019s like. Remember when 16 yr old was younger?\u201d But you went straight for an argument then wanted her to apologise for \u201cher part\u201d. What exactly is her part? Feeling sad?", "Yes, YTA in this case. It sounds like she was just expressing her sadness and you turned it into a fight.  \nIsn't she allowed to feel sad that her son is actively ignoring her? She was not asking you to do anything, just saying how she felt because people sometimes need to talk about their emotions. You had the same right to say how you felt with 16yo being closer to her. You chose not to, but it doesn't mean she should stay shut too.", " YTA, strictly because I can not imagine talking that way to the person I\u2019m married to.

Act like it!", "YTA\n\nHer last baby and youngest child is going through a phase where he\u2019s detached from her and you\u2019re giving HER shit for not having empathy? Jesus.", "Yta.

Why didn't you comfort her?", "It\u2019s usually a pretty clear sign when someone will use this subreddit, and proceed to argue with anyone who doesn\u2019t take their side. Realize how this would sound if you were someone else reading this and relax dude.", "YTA - You are the one who needs to get \"over yourself\" and stop treating your wife as if she was your enemy or rival. You clearly don't understand how important is to prioritise a healthy relationship between everyone, otherwise it will have a negative effect on your kids mental health.\n\n And you def shouldn't have favorites or encourage your son to only spend time with you, just because he seems to only wanting to be with you lately.\n\nThey all will grow up hating each other or seeing that they were treated differently.

Don't ask if you're the asshole if you're unwilling to admit you might be. Your wife is sad not only for the lack of closeness with her 3 younger sons but somewhere in her mind she's blaming herself for that because she's associating it with the surrogacy. The only kid close to her is the one she birthed, even you pointed that out, and so whatever made her unable to carry the younger 3 is being compounded and she tried to express that to you. You turned it into being about you. It's not about you, it's not even about favorite parent. Talk to your wife, she's struggling and she reached out to you and you were horrible to her.", "Reading your replies and gosh... Do you even love this woman?", "YTA ... damn, would it kill you to have like SOME sort of empathy with *your own wife*?\n\n>That our son is closer to me than her? \n\nNO, that he literally *rejects* her as if he hates her or something. And you genuinely can't understand why this makes her sad and tell her to \"get over herself\" and call her jealous?\n\n>because she can't admit her part in our conflict\n\nBecause there is nothing for her to admit. She said it breaks her heart to be *rejected* by her own son. You are the one dismissing her.\n\n>I'm just ignoring her.

Grow up", "your TA my friend, and the only one I see that\u2019s looking jealous.", "yta. men literally need to start just listening and empathizing. she can feel sad about her son rejecting her and none of it is about you! she didn't say she wants him to be less close to you, or that you should do something about it! she just expressed an emotion and expected empathy!!!!", "YTA. She was just expressing a feeling. You could have validated her, but instead you decided to judge her.", "She is entitled to her feelings. As her husband, she should be able to come to you with what hurts her feelings and not be judged for it.\n\nIf she were asking you to make it change, that would be one thing. But her expressing her feelings to you should be met with acceptance of those feelings, not attacks.\n\nYTA, go apologize without immediately contradicting it with a \"but.\"", "YTA. A colossal one. You were jealous about her relationship with the 16 yo and instead of communicating your hurt to her and working it out, you chose to resent her for 9 years until it was your turn to have a child favor you and you could feel all superior about it like the child you are. Not only that, you're so lost in your feelings of superiority over a 7 yo liking you the most, that you're willfully ignoring that his behavior is unhealthy and that he is bordering on the line of codependency. But I guess as long as you're his favorite, you don't care about his well-being either.\n\nThen when your wife does the growned up thing and expresses HER feelings of hurt about the whole situation, you dismiss her emotions, put words into her mouth and cut communication. I thought mind readers didn't exist but apparently you are one. And I didn't miss that little sentence about how she didn't birth the last 3 children. What are you trying to imply by adding that? How is it relevent to the story? \n\nI hope you go to therapy because you really need it to avoid doing irreparable damage to your poor children, especially the 7 yo.", "YTA.

However, there's a real issue here that needs addressing: your approach to the emotional complexities of your relationship with your wife and your children isn't as nuanced as it needs to be.\n\nYour relationship (and your partner's) with each of your children will naturally vary, and it's essential to remember that these dynamics can and will change over time.\n\nHowever, the dismissive way you spoke to your wife about her feelings isn't kind or constructive. No one can dictate how another should feel, particularly about something as personal as a mother's relationship with her child.\n\nYour initial reaction to your wife's hurt feelings lacks love and empathy. Instead of acknowledging her emotions and trying to work through them, you turned the focus on yourself. Family dynamics aren't a zero-sum game. You don't have to 'win' at being the parent your children are closest to. This isn't a competition; it's a family. Your wife's feelings are valid and should be acknowledged.\n\nYou need to open a dialogue that isn't confrontational.\n\n\"Owning her jealousy\" is frankly, a stupid thing to say and isn't a practical solution to this issue. **There is no such thing as winning a fight in a marriage, if you want to stay married.** Instead, try to delve into the root causes.\n\nWhether it's more shared responsibilities or activities that involve both parents, work on it together. Ignoring each other only deepens the divide and ultimately will hurt your children. Consider shared parenting techniques, like joint bedtime routines, to help balance your son's affections. Rotate who takes him to school or helps him in the bath.\n\nThe more divided you are, the more children will pick up on this, which can affect their behaviour and feelings towards each parent. If your youngest senses tension or division between you and your wife, that could exacerbate his inclinations to favour one parent over the other. That is not healthy for your children.\n\nYour later apology for 'overreacting' fell flat because it was bundled with criticism. Telling someone to \"get over themselves\" isn't an apology; it's another attack. An apology should be an acknowledgment of wrongdoing, not a platform for criticism. You can do better than that.\n\nYou're not off the hook here; both partners in a relationship must continually work to keep it healthy. Ignoring the problem\u2014or worse, ignoring your wife\u2014won't make it go away. Show your maturity, your love and your emotional intelligence by taking the first step to mend this rift.", "YTA \n\nYour partner opened up to you about their feelings and you spat in her face about it and turned it into a huge fight. \n\n**You owe your wife a massive apology!

This is a classic case of, \"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.\"\n\nA child being closer to one parent than the other, especially for a few years, is completely normal and healthy.

I hadn't noticed it, but one day she told me that the puppy was showing more affection to me than to her and she was scared she would grow up into one of those dogs who only have one favorite person in the house. I started doing small things like making sure I wouldn't distract the puppy anytime I saw they were having a moment together, I'd let her go on walks with the puppy without me, I'd share with her whenever I found out there was something the puppy would respond to in an affectionate way, like sitting on the floor crossed legs would make the puppy lay down and cuddle on our legs. I let her feed the puppy for 2 weeks in a row. We made sure we'd both attend the training sessions, and we would skip them when I could attend but she couldn't. And so on.

Level 4 of emotional intimacy in marriage is expressing one's own emotions and it sounds like your wife is great at doing that. Like another comment said, you missed your chance at validating her emotions and most likely haven't for a long time.  She was being vulnerable with you.

Wow, I feel sorry for her. Have you never considered her real feelings may have been too complex to put into words? \n\nNot to mention if you're this snide and passive aggressive all the time, she may not feel safe expressing her feelings to you.

Because that's the only reason I can see you responding with such vitriol to a completely normal feeling that your wife expressed to you.\n\n\"How am I supposed to empathise with her\" - the answer is, because she is your fucking wife and the mother of your children.

Did you ever say \"I'm sad that 16yr old and I aren't super close but I'm happy you guys have that\"?. \n\nShe made a comment about her feelings, and in doing so poked a subject that you allowed to fester within yourself.

She didn't answer your question because it's a stupid question that pits you against her rather than trying to support her after she expressed how she feels.

It's clear she can't talk to OP without getting her head bitten off and deserves a safe space to share her thoughts without judgement. \n\nOP needs to get his head out of his ass and realize he can't treat his wife like this.
