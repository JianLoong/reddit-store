You\u2018re an amazing father and your daughter is blessed to have you.\n\nYour MIL is grieving, but she\u2018s not entitled to raise your children or enforce gender stereotypes. You\u2018re not \"replacing\" her mother, you\u2018re stepping up for two and I\u2018m sure that\u2018d be in your wife\u2018s interest.", "NTA. It's ridiculous to think fathers should not have that conversation with their daughter.", "NTA \n\nIt would be unreasonable for your daughter to get her period and for you to say \"period HALT we have to call grandma\".\n\nYou had to help her and explain things to her in that moment. \n\nYou didn't take a bonding opportunity away from her (also who wants to bond over periods? Periods are the worst). Callie will soon have many more changes in her body, she will need go to the gynecologist, talk about birth control and all that. Now you know that Callies grandmother is willing to help have these conversations that's great! It may make Callie feel more comfortable to talk with her grandmother about these things. \n\nIt sounds like you are a really great dad- Callie is lucky to have you!", "NTA\n\nYou are doing your job as a parent. Grandma saying you are interfering by being a good parent is waaaaaay off base, especially considering she had never even discussed this with you.", "NTA. \nYou did the right thing. You educated yourself and had a good conversation with your daughter. I *wish* my parents would have done this with me. I think her grandmother is overstepping a little. Just because you're a man it doesn't mean that you can't have these kinds of important conversations with your daughter and I think it will strengthen your relationship.\nGrandma needs to get over herself.", "NTA. Ultimately she\u2019s your kid, and you did the right thing by being there for her and giving her the info and resources she needs. She could\u2019ve asked to call Joan instead if she wanted to, but she didn\u2019t, and there\u2019s so reason why you should\u2019ve defaulted to calling Joan here", "NTA\n\nI really want to say You mister are a great father, You prepared yourself for this situation and talked with your daughter. Most fathers doesnt Even want to talk about periods with anyone or became flustered.\n\nYour mother in law can still talk to her about it there could be more questions, no one could know what day it was going to be her first period! You did great talking and teaching her! What a Mess it could be if You werent prepared and expected to wait for your in law to talk to her!", "NTA - it's not a special sacred moment  - it's a thing that happens to all girls, it's normal and mundane, though often a bit confusing for young girls - you approached it in the exactly the right way.", "NTA\n\nYou were a good parent. Next this woman will want to give *the talk*", "NTA here and it sounds like you were prepared and had done a little research on the subject, which is great.  The grandmother is likely a bit old school and didn't expect a male to have anything to do with that conversation.  Great job on being there for your daughter.", "NTA.\n\nYou did exactly what a parent should do.\n\nIf Joan had wanted to prepare and help her granddaughter, she should have had that discussion with you and asked you if she could do this well before now. Joan's failure to ask you if she could do this is what \"took away a bonding moment for her as Callie\u2019s mother figure\".", "NTA. You did everything right here. Telling her she should talk to her grandmother as Joan wanted would be indicating that the topic was \"secret\" and something she can't share with you, which is not the message you want to be sending as a parent.", "NTA - she never told you about that so how would you have known? She shouldn't have assumed you wouldn't help and would run straight to her.  \nYou seem to be a good dad - you researched and tried to help your girl as much as possible. That's sweet. Good job.", "NTA. You sound like a good dad dealing with a normal part of growing up with your daughter. If it was that important to her grandmother, she should have made it known. At the end of the day, you are the parent and she is not. \n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your wife! I bet she would be really proud of you in this moment, good job dad.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Too many men are afraid to discuss menstruation and puberty with their daughters. If you had told her to wait to talk to her grandma you would have been showing her it is something embarrassing.", "NTA - You were being a really good parent to your daughter! If her grandmother wanted to be the one to have that specific talk, she should have told you, so you could decide wether she should get to do it or not. You are her primary caregiver, and you helping her out in this new situation is what is expected from you, it's not gender specific. If you want, you can ask her grandmother if there's any other big things she would like to be part of - That way noone gets dissapointed in the future.\n\nYou did great in this situation, your daughter is lucky to have such a great father and grandmother who are litterally fighting over who gets to be there for her!", "NTA, you are her parent and were prepared.  You did the right thing. Grandma can get over it.", "NTA - like at all. \n\nIt's incredibly impactful that you took the time to prepare for this talk with her as her father. It's too often that fathers are seen as wholly incapable of having such conversations with their daughters and it sounds like you handled it very well.\n\nIt's understandable that Joan would be disappointed as she was looking forward to having that talk with her, but you have the right to discuss it with your daughter first.\n\nJoan can always be there to help her when other things come up, but I'm sure your daughter will remember that you were there for her in a big way when this time in her life  came up.", "NTA. There are so many girls in the world who wished they had a father like you. Joan is trying to fill the void of losing her daughter with Callie. While that is understandable, you are Callie's parent, and you absolutely did the right thing.", "Nta. Set more boundaries maybe. This is something for a parent. Is Joan going to be buying all of her products everytime she has a period? You are the one that needs to know", "NTA. It's cool that your daughter feels comfortable talking about these things with you, OP. It's important that she feels free to discuss private and potentially awkward things with her only living parent, especially as she gets older. \n\nI can imagine that losing a daughter would be difficult and that grandma might occasionally overstep or be eager to help fill in on \"mom jobs.\" It's not fair for her to make her big feelings your problem though.", "NTA...Joan didn't have the decency to bring this up until after the fact. You did fine, worry not.", "NTA - She is not her mother figure; she is her grandmother. She doesn't need a replacement for mom. She needs people to be who they are and love and support. The actions you took to be a dad who is stepping up for all facets of your daughter's life is awesome. If this was important to Grandma, she could have told you and you two could have had a discussion about it. You sound like a good dad and your daughter will appreciate that some day if she doesn't totally get it now.", "NTA. You are her parent, you did the right thing- great job by the way- and ignore Joan completely. She's not entitled to Callie's personal business unless Callie chooses to tell her.", "NAH. You ruined nothing. I think you hit nail on head she's angry looking for someone to blame. Perhaps being there for her granddaughter for this when her daughter couldn't be was important for her. She should come over and take her to lunch and maybe invite her to her first gyno? I dunno. But ask her if theres any other life moment she wants to be part of. \n\nYou did great dad.", "NTA  if her grandmother wanted to discuss these things she had plenty of time to bring it up before.  You as a responsible parent did your research & addressed your child's need.  When I child comes to you with something you don't respond with, let's call grandma,  you take care of it.", "NTA You're her parent and the one raising her. Although grandma Joan and her may have a special relationship and she was \"hoping\" to help and bond with her during something like this... it's still up to your discretion. You handled it as you should have. You prepared yourself for the inevitability this would one day happen, you researched it, and you handled it when it happened as you should. She can find other ways to bond with her granddaughter.", "NTA- you\u2019re doing a great job, Joan doesn\u2019t get to be mad over this.", "NTA. Tell Joan she's not Callie's mother figure, she's her grandmother figure. You did great in both preparing yourself, and handling it in a way that showed Callie she can trust you. (Which is important!) What happens if she has an accident through her clothes one day? What if she starts unexpectedly and needs you to bring her supplies? She can't call her grandmother, several towns away; you have demonstrated that you are there when she needs you, and she doesn't need to feel embarrassed. \n\nJoan is hugely overstepping. As the parent, female or not, this responsibility goes to you first and foremost.", "NTA. Joan is not her parent. Going forward, it might be good for your daughter to have a woman's perspective on the changes happening with her also, but I don't think that woman should be her grandmother. Someone closer to your age would be more appropriate. So far I think you have been doing a good job.", "NTA, and Joan can still help if she wants. I'm sure there's a lot more to learn!", "Nta. You are the parent and this is your job. Alot of people would pass it off to a female family member instead so she probably just assumed you would. I give you a lot of credit for researching what you need to teach her, she's lucky to have you.", "NTA. You are the dad, that trumps grandma.", "NTA\n\nKindly Tell Joan to get over herself\n\nShe can still have special moment with Callie. She's not local so what the hell were you supposed to do? Leave your daughter to figure it out for herself?\n\nAbsolutely not\n\nYou are a good dad and did a good thing. \n\nWhat you can do is have Joan pick Callie up on Friday after school, or if you're good with it, let her miss school on Friday and have them spend the weekend together having some \"Welcome to womanhood\" girl time.", "NTA , you did what you knew how to as her only really parental figure as joan is not always there and is not a parent to her, you did what any responsible parent would do .", "It's telling that Joan didn't ask how Callie was, and how she copes with her new \"status\". All she had to talk about was herself, and about how you did her wrong. \n\nNTA, you're a good father.", "NTA, You can't control when a period happens and when it stops so you did the right thing. What was Joan expecting? For Callie to hold her period and for you to be clueless about raising a daughter? You're the parent, not Joan. And you're a very good father, OP. More dads should be like you.", "YTA.  You didn't read her mind!  j/k, j/k, j/k!!!!\n\nNTA.  Because really, you didn't read her mind.  If she wanted that bonding moment, she should have said something.  You were prepared and had the goods, so you did your job as parent.  And well done, I might add.", "NTA if she wanted to have input she should have spoken up AND spoken to her earlier", "NTA.  You are an awesome dad to be able to have this type of conversation with your daughter.  The fact that she talked to you about it and not her grandmother first speaks volumes.  \n\nThis is your daughter.  If you need help then you will ask for it.  Seems like you got things under control.", "NTA\n\nImo in the pecking order a parent should always came before a grandparent (at least in a normal situation).\n\nA grandma is a grandma not a mother figure, sadly the mother is not here and you shouldered her part. You did well and I think you are a good father.", "NTA! Periods are not \u201ca sacred woman\u2019s secret\u201d so it shouldn\u2019t have been up to grandmother to solely provide your daughter with knowledge about her periods. In my opinion it\u2019s great that you provided help and support for your daughter, because it means she can trust you and count on you about *all* health issues and not have to hurry to her grandmother if her period gets late or something. \n\nYou also haven\u2019t deprived the grandmother of sharing an important moment with your daughter, in my opinion. If grandmother wants, she can create a \u201ccare basket\u201d with stuff that she finds/found helpful during periods (like little heating pad, sweets, a cozy blanket or plush) for her granddaughter to feel better on any period and know her grandma cares about her.", "NTA. You're her parent. Grandma isn't.", "NTA but it sounds like Joan built this moment up in her mind and is disappointed. Maybe approach it that way - \"I'm sorry you missed out on this bonding moment with Callie but I'm sure she'd love to talk to a woman about this so I think there's still an opportunity there\".  Joan is wrong to be mad at you but it may be coming from a good place.  Also, as Callie is entering adolescence, it may be very important for her to have a \"mother figure\" like her grandmother to talk about things.  Even if you're doing a great job - and I'm sure you are - she may want to talk to a woman sometimes about things. Prioritize that relationship for her and don't burn bridges with Joan (even if she's wrong on this one).", "NTA at all. You are the parent, not her.", "NTA. You sound like an amazing Dad by taking the time to educate yourself to prepare for this. If it meant that much to her grandmother, she should have brought that subject up to you previously. \n\nGrandmother can do something else special with Callie as a bonding moment.", "NTA.", "She\u2019s not a mother figure whether or not she\u2019s helping care for her. She\u2019s the grandmother. Her role is grandmother figure. She doesn\u2019t love with y\u2019all and is t helping with the day to day stuff, like a mother figure would. You\u2019re the dad. She lives with you and you do both roles as best you can. This was your job and you prepared and do a wonderful job from what you wrote. \n\nI however would be concerned about my mothers choice of words. Especially if she views my child as hers, and not as a grandkid. You should probably have that discussion with your mother.", "NTA. You did good, dad, you were prepared!  What were you supposed to do, have her sit on a towel until she could \"bond\" over it with grandma?", "NTA. When was Joan planning to have this bonding moment with Callie, exactly? Was Joan going to stock your bathroom with pads and tampons just in case? And how great of Joan to make this milestone of Callie's all about her.\n\nYou. Did. Exactly. The. Right. Thing. You told your kid what to expect. You got the things she would need. You personally made sure that she had information in accordance with your family values, and you established yourself as willing to talk about your kid's biological situation. All that needed to be done. You could not wait around for Joan to have her moment. That she never told you she planned on.", "NTA. You did good. Grandma is not the parent and has no say in anything,", "NTA. You did a great job. You were prepared, you were calm, you were present! Why would your MIL think that she's the \"mother figure\"? She's the grandmother. It's lovely that she wants to be an active participant in her granddaughter's life, but you are the parent, and you really are doing wonderfully.", "NTA- you have showed your daughter that when she needs you, you are there, And you are fine with the biology of her becoming a woman, and you won\u2019t hand that off to someone else she doesn\u2019t feel as comfortable or safe with. \n\nAlso if your daughter has really heavy periods please make sure she goes to see a doctor and gets birth control/treatment if possible to reduce the severity, I know a lot of men who haven\u2019t experienced periods don\u2019t know how bad it can be, but it definitely can be. You sound like you\u2019ve done your research and you really care so that\u2019s something I\u2019m putting out there because doctors/society do like to downplay how severe things can sometimes be. \n\nDon\u2019t use your mother-in-law as a reference point she sounds completely out of date about how she feels about women managing their own bodies, based on what she has said about this, she made it about her and not about her granddaughter getting what she needed. Your daughter getting her period is absolutely not about bonding with her grandmother it was selfish of the grandmother to act like that", "NAH - she probably definitely wanted to be the one to fill her daughter's shoes, but she should have told you that long ago. You guys could have even done it as a team. However, I congratulate you on being an amazing dad and doing your research and being prepared for your daughter! \n\nI don't think you ruined anything special, especially without knowing grandma would want to be a part. Maybe let her know that you were just trying to be a good dad and had no idea that it meant so much to grandma. Ask her what other milestones she would love to be a part of going forward so that you two can work together.", "NTA. Her grandmother is still grieving the loss of her daughter and trying to fill the void. You had no way of knowing she would react this way, or that she was looking forward to the moment.\n\nSometimes as a man you can do nothing wrong and you still gotta sit and listen to some woman yell at you.

A lot of women used to put a lot of excitement/ bonding around a girl having her first period and talking about it with her mom. Personally I don\u2019t even remember what my mom said to me it\u2019s not some precious bonding moment it\u2019s a bodily function that needs to be explained to a child.

That's a great dad move. 5*. \n\nUnless there's some religious component I'm missing... my mom is a nurse and gave it to me in a very clinical way. Helpful, but not really sacred or special.\nI don't think Joan is necessarily looking for something to be angry about. It's probably grief, missing her daughter. I would hope my parents haven't discuss led my cycle with anyone other than my doctor honestly.", "NTA. I am going to stand up for Joan a little bit tho. Every family is different and culture plays into those dynamics. The women in my family treated this first period as kind of a coming of age thing. It was treated with excitement and knowledge of what is yet to come. The hardships wrapped up in some familial understanding and support. Maybe it was like that with her daughter. Maybe she was sad her daughter couldn\u2019t have that moment with your daughter. It doesn\u2019t excuse her being rude, but I bet she is just sad. \nThat being said, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it is wonderful that you were here for her in that moment. Beautiful, even. \nI humbly suggest that if she brings up again, mourn with her a little. Don\u2019t apologize, but hold space for her to be a little disappointed. Have firm boundaries that you are the father and a good one at that. And if this was a bigger event in her family, maybe acknowledge that didn\u2019t occur to you. And why should it? You did nothing wrong. It\u2019s okay to be right and compassionate towards the other party. Ideally she processes it and moves on. If she doesn\u2019t, then have a bigger conversation about boundaries. She just might need to be heard a bit of that makes sense? Definitely some mourning wrapped up in this moment for her. Losing a child is brutal and grief is sneaky in its manifestation at times. And of course, so does losing a spouse and the mother of your child. Love and compassion for all of you. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I want to add to this:\nYou are a great dad to have the conversation with your daughter and NOT \u201ehanding it\u201c to a female relative or friend. Because the first thing your daughter learns here that menstruation is (and should be) a normal subject for the men she might have a relationship with in the future.\nAlso: I hated when my mother started talking to other people about me getting my period and making it \u201ea special\u201c thing.

She is YOUR daughter after all.\n\nIf you were a little closer, say if she lived with you, I might understand her stance a little more.

I actually said \"to SOME women and young women...\"", "It shouldn't be anything but a normal thing that all  girls go through to any girl, if any girl is being made to feel that it's not , that is a bad thing, Squishy. \n\nHer Dad did exactly the right thing by not making it some kind of female secret that 'a male' shouldn't know about.", "NTA. You are her Dad, and are an incredible one at that. You did something that, unfortunately isn't considered 'normal'.\n\nYou helped your daughter. And she'll never forget that, it seems she's your go-to for that stuff. You are awesome.\n\nMy Dad taught me to shave my arms. I'm female, but I'm closer to a son in behaviour and we do everything together. The female shit too, if he has to. Mum usually does that, but Dad doing it is even more awesome.", "You did great. \n\nLots of great books about puberty and other tween/teen related things (friendship issues and bullying, how to love her appearance, issues around social media, how to cope with hormones and changing emotions, building resilience, changes with her body, consent, romantic relationships etc etc) so check some out and let her read them or go through them together. You have a great open line of communication right now so keep it open. \n\nAlso check out period underwear. Wish it existed when I was young. \n\nMIL doesn\u2019t get to take on a mothers role. She is the grandma (also a special role). You don\u2019t need to run anything past her.

Her lack of communicating this desire with you is not your problem.", "NTA. You are her father. You do not owe a \"bonding\" moment to anyone. My daughter is sitting here and says we had much better things to bond over than monthly bleeding. Lol", "NTA. You handled it like a champ! She\u2019s fortunate to have a dad like you!", "NTA. I was raised by a single dad from the age of nine or so, he guided me through my first period, and you did even better than he did! I wish all dads were so comfortable and prepared to help guide their daughters through this transition in their life. When I got my first period, my dad was the person I went to because he was my PARENT and I trusted him. I'm not sure I would have wanted to be guided through that by a grandparent. Keep on rockin', dad!", "NTA and good on you! I\u2019m 64 and was raised mostly by my dad. Lol. He took me to \u201cThe Wonder of Life\u201d exhibit at the museum. Diagrams and a movie!!!

Keep on being the good dad you are!", "NTA\n\nYou're parenting your daughter. If Joan wanted to have this talk with Callie she a) could have told you in advance and b) could have had the talk with her at the many facetime opportunities. Kids are entering puberty earlier and earlier, so it wasn't beyond probability that Callie would start menstruating at 10 years old.\n\nKudos for being the dad that was able to have this talk with his daughter.", " NTA,  you did the right thing as you were her parent in a time of need.\n\nThis conversation needed to be had. MIL needs to take a step back", "NTA you're her FATHER. While it may be helpful to have a female who has gone through it for specific questions, you did great. If your daughter was fine with what you told her, that's all that matters. It's hardly a Sacred Female Moment. Now grandma may have wanted the bonding (as a female whose mom handled most of it for me I still think that's odd, my mother was the best but it was hardly bonding, it wasn't much different from her teaching me anything) but it's your daughter's event so it's up to her how it goes and who is involved. The whole 'becoming a woman' is overrated.\n\nI will say two things: one, you should not have let Joan know first. This is DD's decision. If my parent had shared that I had my first cycle with anyone I'd have had a fit. That's her business and no one else's. She chooses if and when to share. You did well. Two, as her parent this is your job (for lack of a better word) and she needs her parent to be the one who helps her through these steps in life. Having her dad there to help her is priceless. I had both parents but my dad was there for anything I needed and it meant the world to me.\n\nOh, and there's still a faction of females who feel this is sacred ground and no men allowed. That may be part of gma's problem. My grandmother was horrified when I asked my dad to pick up supplies for me, but I'm old and she was definitely a different generation.\n\nGood dad. Sorry you lost your wife but your daughter is lucky to have you.", "NTA it could not wait.\nGrandma probably expected she would have the opportunity but too bad.\nI will not ascribe any bad motives to grandma but she is ridiculous to get upset and", "NTA.

Why would you wait until after it happened?\n\nNTA.  Good job, dad.", "NTA. Good on you being a dad who learned this shit and helped her navigate it.", "NTA\n\nAnd your MIL is downplaying her own importance. You were there, physically, in the moment and you did your job.\n\nBut you can't talk about what it's like to deal with this every month, etc... MIL can do that and other things. I agree that she's itching for a fight. You need to have a conversation with her that she's important and you're counting on her, but that you're the parent and you'll be responding to and dealing with things as the come up and on the schedule you see fit.\n\nYour daugther might turn to her--especially when she's older and can reach out to Grandma on her own. But Grandma doesn't get to decide.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing as a dad of a daughter--you prepared yourself fir her future so you could help her prepare for it.", "NTA\n\nMy mother died when I was very young.

If you haven\u2019t already purchased any, the company that makes American Girl dolls has a few books regarding hygiene and puberty. I highly recommend them.", "NTA. Your daughter is exactly that your daughter. Your MIL is Grandmother only to your daughter. You need to set boundaries and be clear to her that you are the parent as there are lots more moments and stages in life to come.", "NTA. While these conversations generally go along gender lines, Joan was out of line in getting angry with you. You're mostly raising Callie alone, so she came to you. To refuse to answer her questions and refer her to Joan would make Callie nervous about coming to you with questions in the future.  If Joan felt so strongly  about the issue she should have talked to you a year or two ago, then you could have agreed . Joan may have thought she had time to do that.  I'm about Joan's age, and in our day it was rare for girls to get their period before age 11 or12.  But for whatever reason, girls are starting earlier now. Props to you for being there for Callie and making her comfortable.", "NTA", "Having my grandmother try and have a special bonding moment with me by talking about periods would have been an absolutely bizarre yet mortifying nightmare for me.", "NTA, wtf was Callie supposed to cross her legs and wait for Joan to be available?", "NTA", "NTA. How were you supposed to know what Joan wanted? You just rose to the challenge of the circumstance and did what you had to do. That's good dad territory, not A H in the least.", "NTA- great dad! Lucky girl!", "NTA. You did the right thing. \n\nMay I recommend Girls Stuff by Kaz Cooke for your daughter to read? It\u2019s really good and informative but funny as well", "NTA. Just be sure to cover all of the bases. There\u2019s period panties & diva cups & teen-size tampons that are way easier to deal with than pads. Pads also come in reusable form so they can be washed over & over. If her cramps get really bad please don\u2019t hesitate to take her to the doctor/gynaecologist. She may need to start on low dose contraceptives to ease the pain.", "NTA- you did well by your daughter in a) informing her and b) playing a part in destigmatizing talk about the menstrual cycle. It isn't \"special\" or miraculous - it's biological.   \nExtra bonus imaginary rewards for you.", "Nta", "Nope, NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for some moment Joan had made up in her head that she didn\u2019t even tell you about. Your daughter started her period, you were prepared and you helped her. You\u2019re a great dad!", "If I understand this neither of you talked to Callie BEFORE her period so ESH\n\nYou MIL is particularly the AH for castigating you when she had done NOTHING herself.

I'm embarrassed she decided to go off on you like that.", "Nah, if it had been important to her she should have communicated that to you.  You aren't responsible for something she wanted but never communicated.\n\nShe probably had some fantasy that you would come to her and ask her to take the lead on that one and that's why she didn't ask, so now she didn't get what she wants and she blames you for her ill-conceived plan.\n\nI'd just say *'Sorry, next time if you want to participate like that just tell me.'* then don't look back.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

We both learnt something. It shows how comfortable you daughter is in discussing this topic with you. Well done.", "NTA, you were perfect.  MIL needs to stay in her lane.  You are filling the role of both parents, and it sounds like you are doing a great job.  No, menstruation is not a \u201cspecial moment\u201d.  It\u2019s a normal part of puberty for girls, but also one fraught with a bit of a learning curve on how to manage it (pads, tampons, cramps, Midol, period-underwear, more vigilant hygiene, etc.). You did good, Dad.  Ignore MIL.", "NTA. Honestly I\u2019m guessing this moment brought back pain for Joan, as this is a moment and conversations a daughter typically has with her mother. \n\nI think you would have been an AH if you DIDN\u2019T prepare her for this and help her through this. Hopefully Joan\u2019s reaction won\u2019t sour the relationship moving forward, but you have been doing everything right!", "NTA. What were you supposed to do just let her bleed on the furniture until grandma stepped in?", "WTF is up with people thinking a girl getting her first period is something to bond over? Its a period. A normal bodily function and literally half the population has to contend with it. It is not some special magical thing. It fucking sucks and OP was a great dad who handled it perfectly. He educated himself so he could educate his kid. And he provided appropriate products to her so she could figure herself out.\n\nNTA OP, your MIL is grieving but she isn't your daughter's mother and she needs some therapy to deal with her issues and not take out her frustrations on you.", "NTA.  You were being a good parent for your daughter.  As a single dad I had to have all that stuff on hand for my daughter the first time.  I had to be prepared because it WAS going to happen.  It's natural and a biological reality.  It wasn't her grandmother's place or right.  You are her parent and there are no gender roles for taking care of your kid.", "NTA! You prepared your girl for the inevitable. This change to a girl's body should never come as a surprise to the girl! I was shocked in the '80s when my girlfriends did not know that periods can be tracked and predicted within a couple days. Today, I'm still shocked that my daughter has had to educate some of her friends with that same info.", "NTA. If Joan wanted dibs on that discussion, she could have called it before it happened.\n\nAnd I'm going to say this as someone who's been in Callie's shoes: When I got my first period, what I needed was an adult who I trusted and who knew more about what was happening than I did. It turned out to be my mom (which certainly helped because she had also been there), but I'd have taken anyone.\n\nI can sort of understand Joan's disappointment but it's not about Joan's needs. It's about Callie's needs. And besides, Callie is going to be menstruating for a long time. Like, once a month for several decades. While she'll eventually get a better handle on it, there will be many more learning experiences. I'm 27 and have been menstruating for about 15-16 years at this point and it still finds ways to surprise me. I'm sure other opportunities will present themselves for Joan to provide guidance for Callie.\n\nAlso, excellent dad behavior on your part. Can we clone you and give a clone to every kid who does or will menstruate?", "NTA. First off, it's your job as her parent; the grandmother who doesn't visit often is not her \"mother figure\".\n\nSecond, she could have talked to Callie about what to expect, 10 is a little young but not unexpected and you obviously knew well enough to prepare. What did she expect you to do, sit her in the bathtub and facetime grandma?", "NTA\n\nYou completely did the right thing, your daughter came to you not her grandmother.", "NTA - You didn't talk to your daughter to steal your MiL's thunder. You had the talk because you're her parent and she needed to know at that time.  \n\nMaybe if her first period had been kind enough to send an invitation or a two week notice, or something, you could have spent some time going down the list of people who might like to feel more important in your daughter's life.  \n\nAnd how dare you not magically know Joan needed to bond with your daughter more than your daughter needed to know about her first period on the day she got it?  \n\nYou need to return that crystal ball for a refund, and Joan might want to try her hand at this strange, foreign concept called \"communication.\"  I'm serious, man. The older you get, the less you will be able to read the future in your tea leaves.  It comes to us all, and there will come a day when you won't even be able to tell the phone is going to ring until it does.", "NTA\n\nYou did great dad.", "Were you supposed to panic and call your MIL like some helpless dimwit? Make your daughter feel like her father isn't capable of discussing her body's natural changes with her? \n\nYou prepared for this day and helped your little girl. I say GOOD JOB, DAD! You being a great dad does not make MIL a bad grandma. There are still so many things that this \"mother figure\" can do with your daughter. You certainly haven't taken anything away from her. \n\nAll you did was prove how dependable you are to the girl who NEEDS you most.\n\nNTA, let grandma take your daughter out to get their nails done as a special celebration, and you keep up the good work.", "NTA, and based on how grandma reacted, I\u2019m kinda glad it was you talking with her instead. I worry that with grandma\u2019s very traditional views, she might have dissuaded your daughter from discussing reproductive health concerns with you, her primary caregiver. \n\nGood job, dad \ud83d\ude0a", "Great job, OP!  So many men would run far, far away from that conversation, but you met it head on.  Awesome!!!  NTA...you did what you had to do.", "nta.  i love that you did this with your daughter, and i am certain your daughter will feel the same way.  i can\u2019t imagine feeling like this is a bonding experience. i was a 13 year old happy that my mom explained it all, but to this day i wouldn\u2019t call it a bonding moment.  we bonded over coloring together in my coloring books on the floor and laughing.", "NTA\n \nI hate to bust grandma's bubble but this talk isn't as memorable to the young girl as everyone thinks it is.", "NTA - \"Joan\" is living in the past, even at her age which isn't exactly old. I'm sure she had expectations as for her generation this was a rite of passage for mother and daughter.  People like Joan are why there are men (and some women) in this world that get offended by menstrual cycles and don't want to know about it, act like it doesn't exist.  I also say props to you not being afraid and going were few men of my generation have gone before.", "NTA. This ritualising menstruation is unhealthy. You talked about it with your daugher in a straightforward manner and gor her some stuff. Probably it would be good for her to talk more with a woman, and maybe your MIL can do that. But who gets to talk to her about it first is just a weird thing to worry about.", "Even if Callie's mother were still alive, a daughter should be able to talk to her dad about periods if she needs/wants to.\n\nIf it was a big deal to grandma, she needed to bring that up 4 years ago or so.

You did it exactly right. She needs to know she can come to you for anything and she does.", "NTA \n\nGrandma is overstepping. You are the parent, not her.", "You are Callie's parent. Joan is only a grandparent. I want to congratulate you for stepping up to the plate as your daughter's only remaining parent, and explaining the birds and the bees to her.\n\nHer grandmother is angry that you took this opportunity away from her, but it's your right and responsibility as the girl's only remaining parent. Joan needs to grow the hell up. You don't have to get Joan's permission every time you teach your adolescent daughter something in life.\n\nYou aren't the asshole. Joan is.", "NTA Maybe Joan is trying to relive a bit of her time with her daughter who passed away but you by no means did anything wrong. You were exactly what your daughter needed exactly when she needed it.", "NTA. The best person to explain such things to a child is the person present when needed. My sister taught my niece (not her kid) when she got her first period at my sister's place.", "I think this was wonderfully put. Growing up I had to learn these things from friends and what I saw on tv.

My mom's response to me screaming when I sat down on the toilet and saw blood, was to write a list on a piece of paper, give me some money, tell me to stuff a bunch of toilet paper in my panties, and walk the 5 blocks to the little pharmacy at the shopping center to purchase the items on the list.\n\nThe clerk was male, and it was a horrifying experience. Not to forget that she believed that using tampons might deprive me of virginity, and the list consisted of one of those damned elastic belts, and hospital sized kotex pads. No wearing pants during periods at high school, with those damned pads.\n\nAt least my bestie friend's mom taught me how to use tampons, and I could wear pants again without looking like I had a full diaper.", "Yes, and. Yes, having a female role model and/or influence is important, AND grandmother is mistaken to assume she is playing the role of a mother figure", "I was 12 when I got my period. My mom didn't like pads and used tampons, but had what I call the \"cheapo feels like a turd in your underwear\" pads for emergencies.

My Dad says hold on and he's got this. He asked what I used and I didn't know, so off he went to the store. He literally did a poll with the store employees to figure out what was the best to buy.
