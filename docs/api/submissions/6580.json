You\u2018re an amazing father and your daughter is blessed to have you.\n\nYour MIL is grieving, but she\u2018s not entitled to raise your children or enforce gender stereotypes. You\u2018re not \"replacing\" her mother, you\u2018re stepping up for two and I\u2018m sure that\u2018d be in your wife\u2018s interest.", "NTA. It's ridiculous to think fathers should not have that conversation with their daughter.", "NTA \n\nIt would be unreasonable for your daughter to get her period and for you to say \"period HALT we have to call grandma\".\n\nYou had to help her and explain things to her in that moment. \n\nYou didn't take a bonding opportunity away from her (also who wants to bond over periods? Periods are the worst). Callie will soon have many more changes in her body, she will need go to the gynecologist, talk about birth control and all that. Now you know that Callies grandmother is willing to help have these conversations that's great! It may make Callie feel more comfortable to talk with her grandmother about these things. \n\nIt sounds like you are a really great dad- Callie is lucky to have you!", "NTA\n\nYou are doing your job as a parent. Grandma saying you are interfering by being a good parent is waaaaaay off base, especially considering she had never even discussed this with you.", "NTA. \nYou did the right thing. You educated yourself and had a good conversation with your daughter. I *wish* my parents would have done this with me. I think her grandmother is overstepping a little. Just because you're a man it doesn't mean that you can't have these kinds of important conversations with your daughter and I think it will strengthen your relationship.\nGrandma needs to get over herself.", "NTA. Ultimately she\u2019s your kid, and you did the right thing by being there for her and giving her the info and resources she needs. She could\u2019ve asked to call Joan instead if she wanted to, but she didn\u2019t, and there\u2019s so reason why you should\u2019ve defaulted to calling Joan here", "NTA\n\nI really want to say You mister are a great father, You prepared yourself for this situation and talked with your daughter. Most fathers doesnt Even want to talk about periods with anyone or became flustered.\n\nYour mother in law can still talk to her about it there could be more questions, no one could know what day it was going to be her first period! You did great talking and teaching her! What a Mess it could be if You werent prepared and expected to wait for your in law to talk to her!", "NTA - it's not a special sacred moment  - it's a thing that happens to all girls, it's normal and mundane, though often a bit confusing for young girls - you approached it in the exactly the right way.", "NTA\n\nYou were a good parent. Next this woman will want to give *the talk*", "NTA here and it sounds like you were prepared and had done a little research on the subject, which is great.  The grandmother is likely a bit old school and didn't expect a male to have anything to do with that conversation.  Great job on being there for your daughter.", "NTA.\n\nYou did exactly what a parent should do.\n\nIf Joan had wanted to prepare and help her granddaughter, she should have had that discussion with you and asked you if she could do this well before now. Joan's failure to ask you if she could do this is what \"took away a bonding moment for her as Callie\u2019s mother figure\".", "NTA. You did everything right here. Telling her she should talk to her grandmother as Joan wanted would be indicating that the topic was \"secret\" and something she can't share with you, which is not the message you want to be sending as a parent.", "NTA - she never told you about that so how would you have known? She shouldn't have assumed you wouldn't help and would run straight to her.  \nYou seem to be a good dad - you researched and tried to help your girl as much as possible. That's sweet. Good job.", "NTA. You sound like a good dad dealing with a normal part of growing up with your daughter. If it was that important to her grandmother, she should have made it known. At the end of the day, you are the parent and she is not. \n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your wife! I bet she would be really proud of you in this moment, good job dad.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Too many men are afraid to discuss menstruation and puberty with their daughters. If you had told her to wait to talk to her grandma you would have been showing her it is something embarrassing.", "NTA - You were being a really good parent to your daughter! If her grandmother wanted to be the one to have that specific talk, she should have told you, so you could decide wether she should get to do it or not. You are her primary caregiver, and you helping her out in this new situation is what is expected from you, it's not gender specific. If you want, you can ask her grandmother if there's any other big things she would like to be part of - That way noone gets dissapointed in the future.\n\nYou did great in this situation, your daughter is lucky to have such a great father and grandmother who are litterally fighting over who gets to be there for her!", "NTA, you are her parent and were prepared.  You did the right thing. Grandma can get over it.", "NTA - like at all. \n\nIt's incredibly impactful that you took the time to prepare for this talk with her as her father. It's too often that fathers are seen as wholly incapable of having such conversations with their daughters and it sounds like you handled it very well.\n\nIt's understandable that Joan would be disappointed as she was looking forward to having that talk with her, but you have the right to discuss it with your daughter first.\n\nJoan can always be there to help her when other things come up, but I'm sure your daughter will remember that you were there for her in a big way when this time in her life  came up.", "NTA. There are so many girls in the world who wished they had a father like you. Joan is trying to fill the void of losing her daughter with Callie. While that is understandable, you are Callie's parent, and you absolutely did the right thing.", "Nta. Set more boundaries maybe. This is something for a parent. Is Joan going to be buying all of her products everytime she has a period? You are the one that needs to know", "NTA. It's cool that your daughter feels comfortable talking about these things with you, OP. It's important that she feels free to discuss private and potentially awkward things with her only living parent, especially as she gets older. \n\nI can imagine that losing a daughter would be difficult and that grandma might occasionally overstep or be eager to help fill in on \"mom jobs.\" It's not fair for her to make her big feelings your problem though.", "NTA...Joan didn't have the decency to bring this up until after the fact. You did fine, worry not.", "NTA - She is not her mother figure; she is her grandmother. She doesn't need a replacement for mom. She needs people to be who they are and love and support. The actions you took to be a dad who is stepping up for all facets of your daughter's life is awesome. If this was important to Grandma, she could have told you and you two could have had a discussion about it. You sound like a good dad and your daughter will appreciate that some day if she doesn't totally get it now.", "NTA. You are her parent, you did the right thing- great job by the way- and ignore Joan completely. She's not entitled to Callie's personal business unless Callie chooses to tell her.", "NAH. You ruined nothing. I think you hit nail on head she's angry looking for someone to blame. Perhaps being there for her granddaughter for this when her daughter couldn't be was important for her. She should come over and take her to lunch and maybe invite her to her first gyno? I dunno. But ask her if theres any other life moment she wants to be part of. \n\nYou did great dad.", "NTA  if her grandmother wanted to discuss these things she had plenty of time to bring it up before.  You as a responsible parent did your research & addressed your child's need.  When I child comes to you with something you don't respond with, let's call grandma,  you take care of it.", "NTA You're her parent and the one raising her. Although grandma Joan and her may have a special relationship and she was \"hoping\" to help and bond with her during something like this... it's still up to your discretion. You handled it as you should have. You prepared yourself for the inevitability this would one day happen, you researched it, and you handled it when it happened as you should. She can find other ways to bond with her granddaughter.", "NTA- you\u2019re doing a great job, Joan doesn\u2019t get to be mad over this.", "NTA. Tell Joan she's not Callie's mother figure, she's her grandmother figure. You did great in both preparing yourself, and handling it in a way that showed Callie she can trust you. (Which is important!) What happens if she has an accident through her clothes one day? What if she starts unexpectedly and needs you to bring her supplies? She can't call her grandmother, several towns away; you have demonstrated that you are there when she needs you, and she doesn't need to feel embarrassed. \n\nJoan is hugely overstepping. As the parent, female or not, this responsibility goes to you first and foremost.", "NTA. Joan is not her parent. Going forward, it might be good for your daughter to have a woman's perspective on the changes happening with her also, but I don't think that woman should be her grandmother. Someone closer to your age would be more appropriate. So far I think you have been doing a good job.", "NTA, and Joan can still help if she wants. I'm sure there's a lot more to learn!", "Nta. You are the parent and this is your job. Alot of people would pass it off to a female family member instead so she probably just assumed you would. I give you a lot of credit for researching what you need to teach her, she's lucky to have you.", "NTA. You are the dad, that trumps grandma.", "NTA\n\nKindly Tell Joan to get over herself\n\nShe can still have special moment with Callie. She's not local so what the hell were you supposed to do? Leave your daughter to figure it out for herself?\n\nAbsolutely not\n\nYou are a good dad and did a good thing. \n\nWhat you can do is have Joan pick Callie up on Friday after school, or if you're good with it, let her miss school on Friday and have them spend the weekend together having some \"Welcome to womanhood\" girl time.", "NTA , you did what you knew how to as her only really parental figure as joan is not always there and is not a parent to her, you did what any responsible parent would do .", "It's telling that Joan didn't ask how Callie was, and how she copes with her new \"status\". All she had to talk about was herself, and about how you did her wrong. \n\nNTA, you're a good father.", "NTA, You can't control when a period happens and when it stops so you did the right thing. What was Joan expecting? For Callie to hold her period and for you to be clueless about raising a daughter? You're the parent, not Joan. And you're a very good father, OP. More dads should be like you.", "YTA.  You didn't read her mind!  j/k, j/k, j/k!!!!\n\nNTA.  Because really, you didn't read her mind.  If she wanted that bonding moment, she should have said something.  You were prepared and had the goods, so you did your job as parent.  And well done, I might add.", "NTA if she wanted to have input she should have spoken up AND spoken to her earlier", "NTA.  You are an awesome dad to be able to have this type of conversation with your daughter.  The fact that she talked to you about it and not her grandmother first speaks volumes.  \n\nThis is your daughter.  If you need help then you will ask for it.  Seems like you got things under control.", "NTA\n\nImo in the pecking order a parent should always came before a grandparent (at least in a normal situation).\n\nA grandma is a grandma not a mother figure, sadly the mother is not here and you shouldered her part. You did well and I think you are a good father.", "NTA! Periods are not \u201ca sacred woman\u2019s secret\u201d so it shouldn\u2019t have been up to grandmother to solely provide your daughter with knowledge about her periods. In my opinion it\u2019s great that you provided help and support for your daughter, because it means she can trust you and count on you about *all* health issues and not have to hurry to her grandmother if her period gets late or something. \n\nYou also haven\u2019t deprived the grandmother of sharing an important moment with your daughter, in my opinion. If grandmother wants, she can create a \u201ccare basket\u201d with stuff that she finds/found helpful during periods (like little heating pad, sweets, a cozy blanket or plush) for her granddaughter to feel better on any period and know her grandma cares about her.", "NTA. You're her parent. Grandma isn't.", "NTA but it sounds like Joan built this moment up in her mind and is disappointed. Maybe approach it that way - \"I'm sorry you missed out on this bonding moment with Callie but I'm sure she'd love to talk to a woman about this so I think there's still an opportunity there\".  Joan is wrong to be mad at you but it may be coming from a good place.  Also, as Callie is entering adolescence, it may be very important for her to have a \"mother figure\" like her grandmother to talk about things.  Even if you're doing a great job - and I'm sure you are - she may want to talk to a woman sometimes about things. Prioritize that relationship for her and don't burn bridges with Joan (even if she's wrong on this one).", "NTA at all. You are the parent, not her.", "NTA. You sound like an amazing Dad by taking the time to educate yourself to prepare for this. If it meant that much to her grandmother, she should have brought that subject up to you previously. \n\nGrandmother can do something else special with Callie as a bonding moment.", "NTA.", "She\u2019s not a mother figure whether or not she\u2019s helping care for her. She\u2019s the grandmother. Her role is grandmother figure. She doesn\u2019t love with y\u2019all and is t helping with the day to day stuff, like a mother figure would. You\u2019re the dad. She lives with you and you do both roles as best you can. This was your job and you prepared and do a wonderful job from what you wrote. \n\nI however would be concerned about my mothers choice of words. Especially if she views my child as hers, and not as a grandkid. You should probably have that discussion with your mother.", "NTA. You did good, dad, you were prepared!  What were you supposed to do, have her sit on a towel until she could \"bond\" over it with grandma?", "NTA. When was Joan planning to have this bonding moment with Callie, exactly? Was Joan going to stock your bathroom with pads and tampons just in case? And how great of Joan to make this milestone of Callie's all about her.\n\nYou. Did. Exactly. The. Right. Thing. You told your kid what to expect. You got the things she would need. You personally made sure that she had information in accordance with your family values, and you established yourself as willing to talk about your kid's biological situation. All that needed to be done. You could not wait around for Joan to have her moment. That she never told you she planned on.", "NTA. You did good. Grandma is not the parent and has no say in anything,", "NTA. You did a great job. You were prepared, you were calm, you were present! Why would your MIL think that she's the \"mother figure\"? She's the grandmother. It's lovely that she wants to be an active participant in her granddaughter's life, but you are the parent, and you really are doing wonderfully.", "NTA- you have showed your daughter that when she needs you, you are there, And you are fine with the biology of her becoming a woman, and you won\u2019t hand that off to someone else she doesn\u2019t feel as comfortable or safe with. \n\nAlso if your daughter has really heavy periods please make sure she goes to see a doctor and gets birth control/treatment if possible to reduce the severity, I know a lot of men who haven\u2019t experienced periods don\u2019t know how bad it can be, but it definitely can be. You sound like you\u2019ve done your research and you really care so that\u2019s something I\u2019m putting out there because doctors/society do like to downplay how severe things can sometimes be. \n\nDon\u2019t use your mother-in-law as a reference point she sounds completely out of date about how she feels about women managing their own bodies, based on what she has said about this, she made it about her and not about her granddaughter getting what she needed. Your daughter getting her period is absolutely not about bonding with her grandmother it was selfish of the grandmother to act like that", "NAH - she probably definitely wanted to be the one to fill her daughter's shoes, but she should have told you that long ago. You guys could have even done it as a team. However, I congratulate you on being an amazing dad and doing your research and being prepared for your daughter! \n\nI don't think you ruined anything special, especially without knowing grandma would want to be a part. Maybe let her know that you were just trying to be a good dad and had no idea that it meant so much to grandma. Ask her what other milestones she would love to be a part of going forward so that you two can work together.", "NTA. Her grandmother is still grieving the loss of her daughter and trying to fill the void. You had no way of knowing she would react this way, or that she was looking forward to the moment.\n\nSometimes as a man you can do nothing wrong and you still gotta sit and listen to some woman yell at you.

A lot of women used to put a lot of excitement/ bonding around a girl having her first period and talking about it with her mom. Personally I don\u2019t even remember what my mom said to me it\u2019s not some precious bonding moment it\u2019s a bodily function that needs to be explained to a child.

That's a great dad move. 5*. \n\nUnless there's some religious component I'm missing... my mom is a nurse and gave it to me in a very clinical way. Helpful, but not really sacred or special.\nI don't think Joan is necessarily looking for something to be angry about. It's probably grief, missing her daughter. I would hope my parents haven't discuss led my cycle with anyone other than my doctor honestly.", "NTA. I am going to stand up for Joan a little bit tho. Every family is different and culture plays into those dynamics. The women in my family treated this first period as kind of a coming of age thing. It was treated with excitement and knowledge of what is yet to come. The hardships wrapped up in some familial understanding and support. Maybe it was like that with her daughter. Maybe she was sad her daughter couldn\u2019t have that moment with your daughter. It doesn\u2019t excuse her being rude, but I bet she is just sad. \nThat being said, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it is wonderful that you were here for her in that moment. Beautiful, even. \nI humbly suggest that if she brings up again, mourn with her a little. Don\u2019t apologize, but hold space for her to be a little disappointed. Have firm boundaries that you are the father and a good one at that. And if this was a bigger event in her family, maybe acknowledge that didn\u2019t occur to you. And why should it? You did nothing wrong. It\u2019s okay to be right and compassionate towards the other party. Ideally she processes it and moves on. If she doesn\u2019t, then have a bigger conversation about boundaries. She just might need to be heard a bit of that makes sense? Definitely some mourning wrapped up in this moment for her. Losing a child is brutal and grief is sneaky in its manifestation at times. And of course, so does losing a spouse and the mother of your child. Love and compassion for all of you. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I want to add to this:\nYou are a great dad to have the conversation with your daughter and NOT \u201ehanding it\u201c to a female relative or friend. Because the first thing your daughter learns here that menstruation is (and should be) a normal subject for the men she might have a relationship with in the future.\nAlso: I hated when my mother started talking to other people about me getting my period and making it \u201ea special\u201c thing.

She is YOUR daughter after all.\n\nIf you were a little closer, say if she lived with you, I might understand her stance a little more.
