The problem lies in the fact that he stays up super late until 3/4am. \n\nHe has to be up at 5am for work and we have a baby and toddler so our sleep is often broken. My husband is always complaining about being tired and it affects him in the daytime.\n\nTo encourage him to sleep at a reasonable time I ask what time he will come to bed. He will always agree to a midnight/ 1am bedtime which is always at least an hour and a half of gaming. He always breaks this and is much later. \n\nI know I am not his mother or in charge of him but it more than bothers me that he doesn\u2019t keep his agreement. He\u2019s making himself more tired and complaining about it. It\u2019s irritating that his words mean nothing and to me he is consciously lying. This is not a one off accident, nor is he only a little bit late. It\u2019s hours. He says he thought I\u2019d be asleep so wouldn\u2019t notice but him coming upstairs wakes me up.\n\nThe most hurtful thing is that I was married before and my first husband died in a car accident on his way home from a night shift. I was woken traumatically by police pounding on my door and my worst memory is looking to his side of the bed and him not being there. \n\nWhen I wake in the night (baby/toddler ensure this) and look at the time realising my husband hasn\u2019t come to bed I have the same panicked feeling. He knows this and it really upsets me that his game is more important than my feelings.\n\nIn my eyes he\u2019s being irresponsible and selfish. He has time to unwind and enjoy gaming but he takes the piss with it. He should be able to stop and come to bed instead of acting like a teenager.

This may require compromise on his part. \n\nHowever, his behavior is being affected by his lack of sleep, and that is a problem.

This is unfair to you.\n\nNot during a fight, but sometime during the day, sit down with him and come up with an actual plan to mitigate this. Ask him if he really *wants* help to stop, or if he\u2019s going to continue doing this. If he agrees to help, you two might want to set up controls for the system or Wifi (is FIFA an online game?) to shut off at a certain time so he has to go to bed. Per his agreement, you can have access to the code.\n\nSometimes people need help getting themselves into healthy habits.

Some people can\u2019t unwind until they\u2019re on their own. For some, 30 minutes of solidarity is enough. For others, 3 or more hours are needed. \n\nFrom what I understand, the only thing your husband has done *wrong* in your opinion is say he\u2019ll be in bed at a time and then stay up later than that time.

I don\u2019t know. I do know that I sometimes do that when I stay up late working and my husband feels similarly to you. He thinks I should be in bed with him and it\u2019s bad for me.

Don't leave the throttle rule enabled all the time so he doesn't get suspicious and start tinkering.", "NAH. You're not wrong - that's an unsustainable amount of sleep. But he's not doing it because of the game, he's doing it because he's needing to unwind and he uses the game to help do that. He's an adult, he can and will make his own choices.\n\nThe only slight inclination towards YTA is making your trauma about him. Your trauma doesn't give you an excuse to control him. You can mention to him why you don't like waking up and he's not there, but it's not a reason to demand anything from him.

You night as well be a single mother.", "Soft YTA for me. The trauma you've experienced is tragic, and I'm very sorry, but that's something you need to address with therapy (perhaps EDMR?). He's not always going to be in bed beside you and it's not good for your mental health for that to panic you.\n\nThe bedtime is his to figure out. He's a grown up. What's more, for a lot of people, staying up late is \"revenge sleep procrastination\" so pressuring him to come to bed is going to have the opposite effect you want it to. This isn't something he's necessarily doing on purpose or knowingly, but the dopamine he gets from staying up late and playing games is going to have decidedly more appeal than going to bed just to avoid being tired the next morning.\n\nBut, you do get to hold him accountable for sharing night time wake ups with the kids and managing his own energy without complaining. He's your partner, and he's a father. You shouldn't have to listen to him complain about being tired when it's wholly his own doing. In your shoes, I'd bring that up with him in a matter of fact way -- that when he's already up, it's fair for him to get up with the kids, and that if he's in bed, you can split the duties (or whatever works out to be fair given your life and partnership). Bring the focus back to how the two of you need to work together to tackle the childcare piece, let him work out his own bedtime, and address your trauma with a professional so that you can release as much of that as possible for your own health.", "Why do you tolerate your life partner summoning you to bed for his damn video game?
