He always breaks this and is much later. \n\nI know I am not his mother or in charge of him but it more than bothers me that he doesn\u2019t keep his agreement.

What's more, for a lot of people, staying up late is \"revenge sleep procrastination\" so pressuring him to come to bed is going to have the opposite effect you want it to. This isn't something he's necessarily doing on purpose or knowingly, but the dopamine he gets from staying up late and playing games is going to have decidedly more appeal than going to bed just to avoid being tired the next morning.\n\nBut, you do get to hold him accountable for sharing night time wake ups with the kids and managing his own energy without complaining. He's your partner, and he's a father. You shouldn't have to listen to him complain about being tired when it's wholly his own doing. In your shoes, I'd bring that up with him in a matter of fact way -- that when he's already up, it's fair for him to get up with the kids, and that if he's in bed, you can split the duties (or whatever works out to be fair given your life and partnership).

And I don't mean that to diminish it, but \"his game is more important than my feelings\" is such a manipulative line in this situation. I could say in turn your need to control where he is at any given point is much more important to you than his mental health needs. You maximising of the weight of your wants, while minimising his, is an issue. You calling his behaviour \"acting like a teenager\" is an issue. Those other five or six nights a week, I'm assuming he is where you want him to be... You're unhappy with his lying, but you'd be unhappy if he told the truth too, which makes the whole issue of his lie almost irrelevent.

If him staying up means he's not doing a reasonable share of childcare or housework throughout the week, that might be an issue.

From my understanding, the revenge part is more like - to get back at the fact that they lack personal time during the rest of the day.

Since it's been at least a few years (based on them being married and having kids) at this point, without professional treatment, it's unlikely to improve on its own.", "Yeah nah what he's doing is disrespectful and insensitive in the first place. I have similar trauma from when my previous partner and I had an argument and then he left the house and suicided so I never got to say goodbye.

All he needs to do is to let me know he's leaving and I'd be fine with it, instead I get this dreadful panicky feeling when I wake alone. I've discussed my feelings and the reason with him to no avail.

In OP's situation, as long as it is discussed and agreed upon, disabling the ability to play FIFA excessively late at night could be a great solution.", "It appears you don't understand what a PTSD response would look like in this situation. It's an automatic trauma response, not rational at all. In that second when you wake and realise all of a sudden that your partner isn't there it's an immediate, disorienting rush of emotion. The feelings override your thinking brain so in that moment you wouldn't even have the capacity to ascertain whether your partner is in the house or where he may be at all.  That comes later, too late, after the retraumatisation has already occurred. Feelings overriding logic is literally what a trauma response is. In the OP's case, when she wakes and he's absent, in her mind she's right back in that moment when her husband didn't come home and she was to never see him again, can you imagine how that would feel like for her each and every time this happens?\n\nI've explained this to my partner in these exact terms and he either doesn't understand or just doesn't care. It hasn't happened for a while now, possibly because I made it clear it's kinda a dealbreaker for me at this point ie next time you just up and disappear like that without reason or warning don't bother coming back.", "OPs husband isn't setting boundaries. He's agreeing to do something and then not doing it, which is lying.", "Did we find the husband?", "No offense but the point they were making is that if doesn\u2019t matter what a PTSD response looks like. The response is her own, unrelated to her husband, and as such should not be used to dictate the behavior of her husband. \n\nHusband should keep to his word, and if the lack of sleep is impacting their relationship, these are the only points here. \n\nHusband could decide to make it a priority because she has a PTSD response, but by no means is obligated to. The reason this distinction is important is because people have PTSD responses for variety of reasons - if logically every person needed to accommodate their demands to avoid triggering them, then they dissolve their own agency and give control to the other person - this isn\u2019t healthy and can easily turn abusive."]}
