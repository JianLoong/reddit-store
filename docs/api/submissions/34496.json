He's your partner, and he's a father. You shouldn't have to listen to him complain about being tired when it's wholly his own doing. In your shoes, I'd bring that up with him in a matter of fact way -- that when he's already up, it's fair for him to get up with the kids, and that if he's in bed, you can split the duties (or whatever works out to be fair given your life and partnership).

Then he should have no excuses about coming to bed at 1am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people in the coments make it sound like he does this daily or every 2 days which is not true from what you said so Im pretty sure that for that once a week or twice a week you can find a common ground and talk openly about it. The man wants to do his 10 games of fifa a week + maybe some climb.", "I\u2019m not really understanding why he feels he is able to \u201csend you to bed\u201d so he can play games\u2026 and why you have a requirement for his bed time. \n\nI get that he wants alone time, but why do you need to go to bed for that? \n\nI also get that you have trauma, but respectfully, as someone who also has loss trauma, you have to work out how to manage that without putting boundaries on the behaviours of others. He isn\u2019t intentionally being callous about your trauma or doing something uncalled for, he just isn\u2019t coming to bed when you want him to. \n\nYou\u2019re both adults, these aren\u2019t choices that someone else should be making for you. I don\u2019t want to vote here particularly because I think nobody is an asshole particularly, but there are some unreasonable expectations causing resentment. I think you need some compromises here, and maybe sit down with each other and have a chat about how these things make you feel.", "ESH, but edging towards N T A. \n\nAs others have said, you need to think about therapy to deal with your trauma response. \n\nHe is displaying the symptoms of gaming addiction (is it interfering with his work and private life? Yup x 2. Is he losing track of his gaming? Yup.) so he really needs recognise that and get it under control. For some people the easiest way to control it is just not to game - certainly that\u2019s my approach as I\u2019m very bad at putting the controller down if I pick one up.\n\nThe defensiveness is typical addict denial behaviour - it may be easier to get your head around and to be able to discuss it with him if you recognise that it\u2019s the addiction talking for him when he gets like that.", "  \nNTA- something clearly needs to change here.\n\nSomething that\u2019s helped me be more aware of the time when I\u2019m gaming is a digital clock positioned just under the TV. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll magically solve everything, but it may help remind him that bedtime is coming up.", "NTA. People are saying you should deal with your trauma yourself. But you\u2019re in a partnership, your partner should be helping you with your trauma if he cares for you. And why do you have to leave the room for him to game? Is he really gaming? Is he in a cyber romance with someone in the game? Is he doing something else? That is what really concerns me - along with the childish \u2018lack of sleep\u2019 tantrums the next day.", "Don't try to give a grown man a bed time. YTA.", ">In my eyes he\u2019s being irresponsible and selfish\n\nYes he is. You shouldn't have to be his mother. He sounds like a bit of a dropkick, really.\n\nNTA. He needs to grow up sharpish.", "NTA, I\u2019m a gamer and married so often my game time is often limited to later in the evening if I want to play on the main TV. It\u2019s not that hard to self police how long you spend doing it to fit around your work/life schedule. I know for example when I need to be in the office the next day so an early night would be a wise choice.", "YTA, just leave him alone. He\u2019s coping with life one way or another and you nagging him is only making it worse. The dude has the world on his shoulders and that\u2019s something you\u2019ll never understand.", "ESH You should not impose a curfew and your husband should be more caring.\n\nIn these types of situations I like to practice the choices vs consequences game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your choice if you stay up but I don\u2019t want to hear any grumbling tomorrow - not a single complaint.\u201d\n\nAnd then when they inevitably try a grumble, \u201cNO! We agreed no grumbling. You stayed up late and you knew what you were doing so I am not listening to any grumbling today.\u201d And don\u2019t back down or get drawn into issues.", ">Your trauma regarding your late husband is entirely understandable, but it does not mean that your husband's sleep schedule should be dictated by it. That is something you need to learn to handle. This may require compromise on his part. \n\nyes, the compromise would be him going to bed at the time they agreed. I don't think it's a big ask of your partner, the father of your children, to do something that avoids triggering a PTSD panic response.", "He's 100% watching porn/paying cam girls. I would definitely put a stop to that ASAP. Makes the worst partners and fathers", "I assume the house only has so many rooms so she goes to the bedroom to hang out or watch TV while he plays. If he\u2019s using the TV in the living room then there might be nothing else for her to do in there if she wants to watch TV.", "Yeah, I don't think he's lying - at the time they're discussing bedtime, I'm sure the idea of getting 1-2 hours sleep sounds awful and of course he'll come to bed at a sensible time. But then once he's actually in the procrastination cycle it doesn't feel like that anymore.", "Yea, my partner and I both do something similar just to have some alone time\n\nI also wonder how much he\u2019s losing track of time. When I game, I feel like it\u2019s been a couple of hours, and I look at my watch and realise it\u2019s been twice that", "This is the point which should be taken most seriously.  It sounds as though he's developed an addiction which he's choosing over his own health.  \n\nBe careful - if he's not getting any happiness or success, is working long hours, and the relationship has significantly changed due to a young child, he may feel like he needs a daily dopamine fix from video games to avoid sinking into depression.  If this is true it is unlikely that he's aware of it.  \n\nThis sounds like it could be a band aid that he's placed over an imminent mental health crisis.  \n\nDoes he enjoy his job?  Has the relationship significantly changed?  Was he getting enough sleep before the fifa addiction?  Does he socialize with friends or just watch your tv shows with you?  Does he have any goals in work or his social life? Or is his fifa campaign his only progress in life?", "I don\u2019t have to actually go to sleep but there are no other rooms in the house where I can sit/relax. Our house is very small. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s \u2018sending me to bed\u2019, more a \u2018would you like to go and have some peaceful time to read/ scroll/ etc while I do this because I know you aren\u2019t interested in my game\u2019. I am a sleepy girl so am happy to retreat to bed while he plays and think it\u2019s nice for him to have some time to himself.", "Don't make it so dramatic. Staying up that Kate is a massive issue, but asking her to move to a different room so he can use the lounge room to game is perfectly fine. It's ni different to asking her to move out so that he could do woodwork or paint. He's probably fine if she stays in the room, but would feel more comfortable with her not distracting him. \n\nVery sad that your not open minded to people having different hobbies to the ones that you like. Especially a hard working man like OPs husband. Again, staying up as late as he does is a major problem, but wanting a little space while he enjoys a hobby alone is perfectly fine.", "Honestly, the fact that he wants her to go to bed before staying up so late .. Idk. I dated a guy who would sit up on his phone and look like he was just doing normal stuff, but would message camgirl accounts / etc when he was alone. I've never had a guy insist on privacy for playing video games with friends. The fact that this guy is already for-sure struggling with compulsive, self-destructive behavior makes me skeptical that he just wants that many hours of privacy to play Call of Duty or whatever.", "lol between work, daily commitments, chores, a baby, there\u2019s almost certainly no \u201cmore reasonable time\u201d than when the baby is asleep, and chores have been completed.", "The smartest responses are being down voted \ud83d\ude02 dumbasses as usual.", "Holy fuck, finally someone else who see the real problem here.", "It's not about her \"emotional well being\". She's trying to use her trauma as an excuse to control him. She needs help from a professional. Giving him a bedtime doesn't change that fact.", "Best time to play a game is when everyone's in bed, it's better for immersion. But like you said yea loose track of time is easy too. I'm always in trouble for this.n", "There's a difference between helping someone with their trauma and letting trauma rule everyone's lives. She needs to get help herself and deal with her issues. It's no one else's problem to deal with other than her own.", "Agree but maybe an ESH. It\u2019s once or twice a week. If that\u2019s his choice he needs to not complain about it and still take care of his responsibilities. (Source: Stayed up until 3-4AM for like 3 weeks when Baulder\u2019s Gate came out. Worth it!) \n\nBut OP needs some help with her trauma. What if she wakes up and he\u2019s in the bathroom? Or he got up to take care of the baby. Or because he couldn\u2019t sleep. There are lots of reasons he might not be there. I hope she can work through it.", "OP asking him to go to sleep earlier so he's not driving while sleep deprived is totally reasonable, yes. \n\nOP asking him to go to sleep earlier because she gets agitated if she wakes up and he's not next to her is clearly something she should be working on, not something that should control his sleep schedule.", "lying indicated intention.  He probably just gets caught up in the game, he's not \"lying\".  Why is his wife trying to give him a bedtime?  That's just weird.", "this is a huge leap we have no evidence for. nothing in this post points to that. you seem to be projecting.", "What a wild and incredibly stupid thing to say.", "Wtf, lol.", "It really depends on the game I play. If i play something like LoL or R6 i feel like i can keep track of it better because you have to get into a new match every 20-40 minutes. But if i play Rimworld or cyberpunk i just lose track because you never really get thrown out of the game. But for judgement I'd go for an ESH because he needs his sleep but she needs a therapist and get over that trauma of hers", "There is a chance that this is happening but it\u2019s kind of a bold accusation. OP doesn\u2019t mention cheating at all. And just because you don\u2019t know people who want privacy when doing things for themselves, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. I personally don\u2019t want anyone in the room when I\u2019m working on any of my hobbies. And I\u2019m not using that time to message cam girls lol. \n\nI suggest you to be careful in your personal life with making these \u2018claims\u2019 where the only shred of evidence is your own past experience. If we would be in a relationship and you would project your toxic past relationship onto our healthy one I\u2019d be out. And I have been out a few times because of this. \n\nThere was this girl that I was close to and she had an ex that was disapproving towards her race and family for some reason (she\u2019s Muslim). And therefore asked me if I\u2019m going to be racist towards her & her family considering I\u2019m a Jew from Israeli descent. She assumed 1. That because her ex was racist I was too and 2. She was being racist herself and I feel like I dodged a bullet here.", "Ah I see the problem", "She says she is willing to hive him his me time. A couple of hrs of gaming after she is in bed is fine. But he needs to get up at 5, staying up to the wee hrs of the morning and only getting a hr or 2 of sleep is going to lead to a lot more issues then just triggering her trauma. As my post states I am speaking from personal experience", "Yeah, I know, but he is a husband and father with a full time job, sooner or later you have to prioritize, I was looking to see if there was a way for everyone to be happy.\n\nETA and everyone was getting so bent out of shape over his \"gaming addiction\".", "Once you've done it twice a week for weeks, you're not just getting \"caught up\". \n\nIt's not weird for a person to want their spouse to be moderately well-rested, especially not when his lack of sleep is affecting her.\n\nAlso she probably doesn't want him to die in a car wreck from driving on two or less hours of sleep? Because that's super dangerous.", "She doesn\u2019t have to go to bed for him to be alone in the other room.\n\nMy husband is a very serious gamer.  Most of the systems and accessories he has were bought by me as gifts.  I want him to enjoy his time on his game with his friends. He makes me, our home and his job priority.  Most of his off time is spent gaming, and I\u2019m ok with that.  He gives me my quality time first, and after that, I make him easy meals so he can eat while playing whatever game he and his friends are currently playing.  He pauses and they wait if I need something which rarely happens, but what never happens is him telling me to go to bed so he can be alone to play.  That just sounds ludicrous.", ">She doesn\u2019t have to go to bed for him to be alone in the other room.\n\nKinda does depending on how many rooms they have. I mean he probably doesn't literally mean \"go to sleep this instant\". Just means go to their room.", "Opinion and fact aren't the same thing, and your opinion is extremely wrong.
