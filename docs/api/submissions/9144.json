You\u2019re the asshole and how do you see your niece once a week and not know what she likes. \n\nI have a niece on my husband\u2019s side and I\u2019ve only spent some time with her for a couple months because they live on the other side of the world and I know her enough that she likes adventures, and hello kitty and food.\n\nHow are you so much of an asshole, truly??", "Wow! The mental gymnastics your employing to justify your behaviour is astounding. YTA", "YTA.  All you cared about is if YOU thought it was funny, right?  Shame on you.  Buy her a decent gift and apologize to your niece.  Grow up.", "You see her once a week but don\u2019t know what she likes or dislikes? So much so that your only recourse is to get her a gag gift? That doesn\u2019t add up. If nothing else you could have googled \u201cgifts for 8 year old girls\u201d. I don\u2019t think you meant any harm with your gift but it was a bit of a faux pas to give a gag gift to an 8 year old.

No. Then it wasn't a joke. \n\nI support my state's team, same state I've lived my entire life. Same state my children were born in and lived. They all however go for another state's team.

YTA jeebus. You get off on hurting 8 year olds.", "YTA you bullied a literal child. You\u2019re fucking weird.", "Yta, look gag gifts arent bad as long as you actually have a real gift after. If it's just a gag gift do it to someone who loves those and not on a special occasion or when they are feeling down. I wouldn't do it to a child either. You should've at least gotten her a serious gift to open either, especially one related to the gag gift. Then she most likely would've just laughed and itd be a funny lil memory. But now it's just disappointment. Yta. But seriously most eight yr olds wont like the gag gift.", "YTA. Who TF does gag gifts anymore?", "Honestly, it really seems that those who get enjoyment out of giving gag gifts, especially gag gifts to kids\u2026 are just bullies", "Yes! YTA.

THAT would have been a gag. This was just asinine.", "Yep! I am generally not into sports but I have fond memories of watching sports with my dad so when people ask middle-aged me what my favorite teams are I rattle off his favorite teams. I did the same as a child and would have been upset if someone gifted me a Mets jersey when we were a Yankees family. And despite not being into sports would have worn a Yankees jersey happily.", "She probably likes spending time with her dad and he likes sharing his hobbies with her.

YTA.", "She likes watching the team with her dad you absolute laundry basket. It's bonding time. Most people like sports at least in part for community/family bonding. And 8 is a prime age to start following a team.", "What was the gift? If it wasn't the same jersey for her favorite team,  YTA.", "You really don't see how it might be sexist? OK, try this: It's sexist because OP apparently believes that young girls can't actually care about sports. Their fathers can \"push\" sports on them, but that's it. And if they actually do care about sports, they can only do so in general \u2013 by supporting all teams, not just one \u2013 whereas it's perfectly fine for men like Max and OP's boyfriend to support only one team. \n\n\"I was told the sports team that Kay and Max follow (I doubt Kay is interested it seems likely Max just is). ...

An 8yr olds birthday party is not the time to pull cruel bait and switch \u201cpranks.\u201d Even worse you then completely minimised and belittled the upset YOU DELIBERATELY CAUSED, because jokes. This is the kind of prank and justification a bully uses to out other people down. Given the way you talked about your niece, before and after you decided to let her down on her birthday, using a bully\u2019s prank seems right on brand. \n\nYTA.

You played a joke on a 8 year old child and are now mad because your being called out on it. \n\n\"My(24f) sister, \u201cAva\u201d and I don\u2019t have the best relationship\"\n\nShocker. Who would have guessed that a person shitty enough to play a trick like that on a 8 year old child, doesn't have a good relationship with her sister...

What do you do? How do you not know anything about an 8 year old you see once a week?", "YTA for so many reasons. You assume she doesn\u2019t like sports because she\u2019s a girl.

Can you get our hopes up for nothing a gag gift is never a good idea.", "YTA if you don't understand why Kay doesn't want to see you, you are clueless.

I'm a lifelong Red Sox fan, and my son is a Yankees fan. Am I thrilled that he likes my team's biggest rival? Hell no. Do I get him Yankees stuff as gifts? Yes I do - because I love him and want to get what HE likes. And now I also have a grandson to buy Yankees gear for.", "This isn\u2019t funny at any age.", "So what?  Lots of kids root for the same team as their parents, especially when young.

How dare you insult the potato--a potato can become chips or fries and offer comfort in the form of delicious delicious food.
