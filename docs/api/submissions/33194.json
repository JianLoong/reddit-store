Everything went smoothly except one thing that we constantly butted heads in: what we will do with my bird. I love my bird, he's my precious baby but my fianc\u00e9 HATES birds to his core. He hates EVERYTHING about them, he thinks they should not be pets and also has some bad things associated with them which I won't go into details about.\n\nHe would not agree to letting me bring my bird with me and wanted me to leave him with my parents, I did not want that but it would've been  difficult to keep them there because of the apartment he lives in (he was worried about noise complaints because of shitty neighbors) and the fact that I would not be able to bring my other bird because she is my parents birdie and both of them are bonded.\n\nIt was possible but not easy and he did not agree to even TRYING to see if it would work out so I eventually relented and did not bring my bird with me and he is at my parents but I told him that he did not even try to do anything for my pet and doesn't care about him so I will not do anything for his dogs either, they will be 100% his responsibility and under no circumstances, will I do ANYTHING for them. (unless he's sick or something then I'll feed and walk them but that's all I do, the bare minimum) and only then will I agree to not bringing my bird with me.\n\nHe happily agreed and it's been a few months now and his work has picked up due to holidsy season and he has had to do 60-80hrs/week and he is extremely tired when he gets home and then has to take care of the dogs. I work 40hrs/week and he asked me if I would be willing to walk them before he gets home so he can relax and I said I won't bc I only said I'd help if he was sick and we have been fighting about it a lot with him calling me petty and selfish and me sticking to my guns, AITA?\n\nEdit: I've read most of the comments and I will reply to them later but just to clear up some things I saw in the comments, I had to remove a lot of the details because it was well over the word limit and wanted to make this post not too long.\n1. when i said it was hard but possible and I was upset about him not letting me try to make it work out, what I meant to say was that I wanted to talk to my parents about letting me take both birds (the other one is technically their bird but I'm the one who took care of all of its needs they just played with it now and then) I would never separate my bonded birbies + I was hoping we could work out the problems with his apartment and hoped he would learn to like them too.\n2. The part I said about bad things being associated with birds but I won't go into details is according to his wishes because this AITA thing was his idea and he read this post before I posted it and he asked me to remove the details about it.\n3. I knew he didn't like birds but I never thought that it would be bad enough that he wud make me leave them behind because I don't like dogs either but I'm more than happy to have them because it's his dogs and he loves them so I was willing to learn to love them too.\n4. Also I do everything around the house lately because he's been working so much so I took over all the chores and tasks basically Im just refusing to do stuff regarding the dogs due to our agreement.\n5. it's not like I just ignore the dogs, they chill in the same room as me and if they come for pets I don't just dismiss them I just don't do anything related to taking care of them, they're not being abused, they get walked twice a day, once in the morning before he goes to work and once after and they're always fed on time.", "created_utc": 1702803815, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kdbda/aita_for_sticking_to_my_word_and_not_helping_my/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As far as the bird is concerned, I don\u2019t know where to start, but you didn\u2019t ask for comments about that. One thing I will say though is that I would never consider a relationship with anybody who didn\u2019t accept my children or animals 100% and I would never abandon my animal for a human relationship (I initially refused to date my husband because he was allergic to my pets). In this case, your bird is probably better off with your parents and its buddy but still - he has shown you his true colors.", "If he was alone, who would  be caring for those dogs after work? Not you. Nta It was nice for him because he got what he wanted, till he didn't.", "NTA.  It would be nice if you could walk his dogs when he works long hours, but that is a courtesy on your part, not a responsibility.  You made it clear from the beginning that his dogs are his responsibility.  If you were not there, they would be his responsibility regardless of how much he works. \n\nI am, however, concerned about his dogs having to wait all day to be let out to pee and poop.

If not, the resentements will be so bad, the relationship fails sooner or later. And he already prooved now that he expects you to be the compromising partner while he only pretends to compromise and then goes back on it after a short time (and never planed to stick to the compromise) and expects you to be fine with it. His pov is very simple. He counts on it that now that you already gave up your home and moved to his country and already gave up your pets, you have already invested a lot so you will accept whatever new BS he comes up with bc you won't go back due to investing so much already.

That feels like you care more about yourself being happy than your pet. Which puts you into AH territory for me.\n\nI think you're justified in sticking to an agreement you made.

If he hates birds this much, you aren\u2019t the right girl for him.  This really sounds like basic incompatibility.\n\nJust break up now.", "NTA. He made his boundaries clear on your pet and you made yours clear when it comes to his pets. Both of you accepted that, so how could you possible be the asshole for sticking to your agreements. I find it funny that he's worried about noise complaints with your birds while owning dogs, but perhaps his dogs make less noise then the ones my parents and sister have, because those are all quite noisy.\n\nReading all this I do have to say, the start of you moving in with him comes over as very aggressive between the two of you, as both of you took pretty extreme stances towards each others pets and since he wasn't willing to give an inch you decided also not to give an inch. It really doesn't sound like a very healthy and constructive start to that phase of your relationship. Even more so now that he's showing that he doesn't respect this agreement and is calling you petty and selfish for sticking to it. That shows a lack of respect for the established boundaries and a lack of respect for you. He's willing to ditch an agreement and cross your boundaries the moment it becomes inconvenient for him to stick to it.\n\nAre you sure this is the kind of relationship you want in the long term and that he is who you want to marry? Because you aren't painting a very positive picture of your fiance and your relationship with him here.", "NTA. \n\nYou made clear to him you would only feed and walk his dogs if he was sick.

He loved them, even tried to keep one in the end, but that last day, I was done. Both are grounds for leaving each other. My animals are nonnegotiable, and would hate myself for abandoning them.

Doesn't sound like a compatible relationship. Sorry about your bird.", "ESH. There is nothing to be proud of in first being ready to break a pair of bonded birds apart and put the bird through the stress of moving, and then to take out your frustration by refusing to care for dogs that clearly don't get enough attention. \n\nYou're being so self-absorbed and petty. Get over yourself and do what's right for the innocent dogs who have no part in your unhealthy power struggle with this man you aren't suited to. That part's on you. It's not the fault of the dogs.", "YTA. More than half your post is about the bird (you couldn\u2019t take it anyways if he is bonded, so I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so relevant). I understand if you don\u2019t want to take care of the dogs because you don\u2019t like them or whatever, but you are doing it out of resentment.

If you hadn't moved he would still have to take care of the dog whether he was exhausted or not. Maybe he shouldn't have a pet he can't take care of.

That's just incredibly selfish, and cruel AF.\n\nYour fiance's TA for not taking a mutual agreement between you seriously, and frankly, because no one working 60-80 hours a week with the dogs at home alone should be keeping dogs unless they have a care system for the dogs, e.g. doggy day care, dog walker.\n\nNeither of you should have any pets at all until you learn that to be a responsible pet owner, you need to consider their needs before your own comfort.", "YTA to yourself for agreeing to marry this man. Your post reads of two incompatible people playing tit for tat with lives of animals. You both sound exhausting. End this farce now and stop dating asshats who don't like birds if you want birds. Taking out you displeasure on his dogs is pretty vile - they aren't the ones acting disrespectful and taking advantage of you.", "YTA.\n\nYes, you made the agreement of no non-emergency help, so you are perfectly in the right to hold to the letter of that. But at the same time, a caring partner will make small sacrifices to help their partner when times are hard for them, whether they 'have' to/'should' or not.\n\nYou were considering taking your bird away from it's mate (bad), and when you couldn't you resented your bf for something you surely knew before move-in discussions would be an issue (also bad, and pretty unhealthy). If the bird was that important to you, why had you continued the relationship past the point his aversion was unveiled? Honestly? It sounds like on some level you always knew leaving the bird behind was the only option, but rather than seeing it as choosing to let it be happy, you saw it as abandoning your pet, so let things play out and then dumped your guilt onto your boyfriend. That's unfair, and, again, pretty unhealthy. Do you plan on resenting him forever? Is every dispute going to somehow include \"well, I gave up my bird for you!\" armtwisting? \n\nYou need to either move back, break up, and ensure your next love interest is pro bird and able to wait on your parents dying so you can take both...or deal with your resentment in a healthy way, talk to your partner about your feelings, and move on as a team.

I dont think you are an asshole, you did make your position clear and he would have had to care for them 100% before you. He also agreed to this. \n\nThe only thing i would say is i think there is some balance here. There is a need to find middle ground in relationships and it sounds like both of you arent the best at this. Maybe there is something in helping him if he is at a certain very high level of busyness like 70/80 hours. I am assuming in these peak periods hes out at work till late, then he comes to sort the dogs out,  eats and then  crashes so you get pretty much no quality time together in these periods. I think you should think about the bigger context of your relationship long term than about an agreement you made due to the bird argument.", "I am here, just to say that, of course, birds shouldn't be pets. Why people still insist on putting a creature that flies hundreds of miles in nature in a cage is beyond me.\n\nIt's like a whale in a tank.

It was both to see if it would work, or none if parents said no or bf would not relent.", "Worst take out of all of them lol", "If he's getting paid overtime, he can get a dog walker.", "Literally I\u2019m so scared of birds especially in the UK with massive sea gulls, pigeons and lots of swans and geese it\u2019s a common fear- I actually agree with the boyfriend on this (especially as the bird is mated). It sounds like she\u2019s more angry that she moved country and wants to blame it on someone.", "She'd have to live with her parents until it/it's pair died. This is why people shouldn't buy themselves pets while living with their parents!!", "She'd have been a real AH if she'd taken it! It's pair bonded!! The bird cares way more about the other bird it has bonded to than the woman who sometimes puts food in it's cage.", "This. This is so important and people dont talk about it enough. Men often start doing some chores so you move in with them. And as you are trapped there they do less and less. I am stuck in a loveless marriage where he treats me like a maid. It started with \"we will be equals\", to \"can you do x i dont like it\". To me doing 100% of the housechores even if now i am disabled and very ill. He doesnt even walk the dogs and i can barely walk!\n\nThis is important for two reasons. First to the typical people who dismiss women saying \"then why did you move in/married?\". Its because it was better before. And second to show women when they need to run before it becomes too difficult.", "\"Of\"!\n\n\"This situation reeks of breakup.\"", "\"like\"?", "like a?", "Where did she do that?", "If OP hadn't moved with her boyfriend the dogs would be in the same situation as now.\n\nHow is she cruel to not care for some dogs she doesn't care about? Do you adopt all dogs on the street and care for them?", "Why doesn\u2019t it make the bf the  asshole since they are his dogs??? She never had responsibility for them so she is NTA. He is. What if she never moved in with him! The dogs would still be there with no walks or food due to the dog\u2019s owner choosing to be away for that long. If you can\u2019t take care of the dog due to your schedule, don\u2019t have the dog.", "It\u2019s the bf\u2019s choice to work so much and not hire a dog walker", "[deleted]", "maybe he won't even be taking on long hours if she wasn't there, food for thought, most men don't start super hardwork like that till they get a fiance/wife to make sure they are secure.", "I agree thats a good suggestion as a way forward.", "Yeah, my wife is the same. It\u2019s like every year more and more chores end up on my plate, while I\u2019m the only one working too. She just sits and knits and watches tv. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve started to just let things get gross until she finally takes care of it. Especially the things that are 100% her mess, like hair in the drain.", " In this case, your bird is probably better off with your parents and its buddy but still - he has shown you his true colors.", "He should either put them in doggy daycare or get someone to walk them during the day.", "In her edit to the post", "In the edits to the original post.", "That's not necessarily true. I will walk half an hour multiple times a day to feed my sister's cat when she's away. I absolutely wouldn't do that if her husband was home. The dogs may have been offered additional help if OP hadnt been living there. Ignoring dogs in your house that are hungry and need a piss is cruel.", "[deleted]", "That's what I said.", "To be clear, I don't think she SHOULD be responsible. But by her presence, she is. That's how  animal care works. If you won't do what an animal needs because you're hung up on whether you're right or not, you absolutely suck. There is no grey area about that in my mind. Sort out an alternative. Have a conversation with your partner. But DO NOT neglect the animals in the meantime to make some sort of point.", "Why are you still with her?", "Oh, it wasn't showing when I got your comment.", "So you're saying you'd walk if she's away not when she's too tired or doesn't feel like doing it.\n\nIt's certainly your right to decide that your help is conditional.", "Read the edit", "Commitment to the person I love, kids. I took that \u201cfor better or for worse\u201d vow seriously.", ">It's certainly your right to decide that your help is conditional.\n\nIt is. But if i was exercising that right when the animals were inches from me, hungry and desperate for a piss, I'd be an AH! \"It's my right\" and \"I'm in the right\" are two quite different things.\n\nThere are many hours when she is home, and he is away. Not doing it when he's there is understandable, it's the hours of ignoring the dogs that aren't.", "In OPs situation he is right there, he just doesn't want to do it", "In OP's situation, she's at home for 30/40 hours a week that he isn't. And he isn't usually away from the dogs in those hours."]}
