No need to post on Reddit for a literal 10 minute solution to your problem.", "I've used shot glasses to pit my contacts in because I didn't have a case, but I was given permission. Not that big a deal, wash them problem solved, also I'm sure OP has had worse in their mouth, like body parts for example", "honestly i don't think anyone is an asshole, but you're overreacting. boo hoo, she soaks her nipple in the glass. and then cleans it after? you do realize what CLEANING does, right? \n\nsucks that she has to deal with the infections and has a roommate on her ass about using a shot glass that is readily available to help alleviate her pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nagain, no one is an asshole, but grow up mate", "Wow. Definitely NTA. I\u2019m actually a body piercer and these \u2018saline soaks\u2019 can be done a lot easier than holding your tit in a fucking shot glass lol She needs to get a spray bottle and store the salt water in the fridge, make a fresh batch every 7 days.

And she should designate one for it, because that would make sense\u2026. but also what\u2019s the difference between soaking your piercing and having random people put their mouths on the shot glasses\u2026 Often getting their bacteria filled spit back into the shot glass? Either way it gets washed (hopefully)", "NTA, ewwww she's disgusting! I can just picture  graphic images of crusty nipple piercing debris swirling around & drying up at the bottom of your shot glasses \ud83e\udd22.", "If they are cleaned it doesn't matter one bit.", "NTA that's just disgusting doesn't matter if they're cleaned afterwards or not.", "Oh no that made me almost vomit up my lunch. NTA she\u2019s inconsiderate and filthy", "I\u2019ve had my nips pierced three times and I\u2019m pretty sure the shot glass soaks for the first two made the tissue irritated and dried out. The third time I practiced the LITHA method and the only used running water in the shower and they\u2019ve healed much better. Nipple piercings have a very long healing window (up to a year) and can produce a decent amount of discharge, which is different from an infection. If her piercings aren\u2019t healing properly, she should see a piercer. And get her own damn shot glasses if she wants to keep soaking the things.

And how are they getting infected so frequently that she's doing this often enough for you to have an issue with it? \nAs someone with pierced nipples, I didn't have this issue.

Haha. Where is the picture? Haha", "Probably just that...
