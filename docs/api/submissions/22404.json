It would be okay if she used two designated ones of her own to do this with, but it\u2019s the one we frequently use to take shots out of. I know the dishwasher is an option, but still just grosses me out. We have always had an issue where she doesn\u2019t respect my things or me at all. I asked her if she could maybe just use hers for it or even just use the same two every-time and put them off to the side, and she got extremely defensive and annoyed with me and has still been using them, sooo AITA for being grossed out by this? Our living together has not been smooth and I think just was the cherry on top for two years of nonsense.", "created_utc": 1689515447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1516sun/aita_for_confronting_my_roommate_about_using_our/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
