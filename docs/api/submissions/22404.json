I know the dishwasher is an option, but still just grosses me out. We have always had an issue where she doesn\u2019t respect my things or me at all. I asked her if she could maybe just use hers for it or even just use the same two every-time and put them off to the side, and she got extremely defensive and annoyed with me and has still been using them, sooo AITA for being grossed out by this? Our living together has not been smooth and I think just was the cherry on top for two years of nonsense.\n\nedit: thank you for the validation that i\u2019m not crazy everyone, this is the smallest issue we have rn out of many and just needed to get it off my chest because it\u2019s for sure the grossest one.-moving out in 3 months", "created_utc": 1689515447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1516sun/aita_for_confronting_my_roommate_about_using_our/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have had 9 piercings in my life (let a few close up now) and I've never used anything other than disposable cups or bowls to clean them.

I have two piercings in each nipple. Never got an infection. She shouldn't have piercings at all in this case. Especially nipples which tend to be more temperamental. If she keeps this up they're going to reject I imagine. That shit scars", "Oh I misread the part where it belong to OP, sorry, NTA in that case.", "It can be cleaned. You never use a glass or any dish as a receptacle for various things, be it a cleaning mixture or such ?", "Too true. Op needs to get/bleach the ones DRM (disgusting room mate) contaminted and lock them in her own room.", "Because  she still has to live with the person.
