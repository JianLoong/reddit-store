My MIL only buys one brand of cornflakes, she needs gluten-free and whilst there are alternatives to her preferred brand, they aren\u2019t the same. The fact that her brand is not sold in many supermarkets complicates things even further. Plus it is the cheapest gf cornflakes and ORGANIC makes it even more difficult to get. We have even discussed with one of the supermarkets whether ordering it online would solve our difficulties to be told \u201coh no, we substitute\u201d.

You buy the Target brand because it's cheaper.\n\nIf you compared the sugar content, side by side, you'd see that the Target brand has 10 Grams more sugar per serving than Welch's.\n\nYour wife specified the brand for a reason. 10grams more sugar, means more sugar for the children.

We don't have a lot of money, but there are things that I refuse to skimp on because of quality. Dish soap, laundry soap, pads, tampons, shampoo, etc. Sometimes even foods like certain soups, ravioli, coffee and tea. Cheap is great, but if it tastes like shit is it really a good deal? Same for dish soap. You'll have to pry my Dawn and Platinum Cascade from my cold dead hands, store brands simply do not compare. I know this because I tried them.

You don't think she's tried off-brand cereal?   \n\nKids are notoriously picky eaters, and the cheap brand isn't worth the 0.40 cents you saved. \n\nLaundry detergent, soap, and bodily products are often chosen based on the families' dermatological needs. \n\nIs the 0.40 cents worth this argument? I think not. \n\nIt's fine. You tried to save money and you didn't get the \"gold star\" of approval you wanted OP.  Don't double down on your decision.

When called out on it, you had to defend your authority and assert your budgeting intelligence by cutting her down in a childish manner. \n\nThis isn't about the groceries and brands.

Here is an example of why the cheaper brand  can end up costing more. Cheap one-ply  toilet paper costs less than Brand 2-ply toilet paper. But you need twice as much Cheap as  Brand when you use it.

The solution to this is a compromise, both parties are happy/unhappy with.\n\nThis sort of thing escalating to this level tells me there must be something else wrong (camel's back situation).

Brand loyalty is important to most women.\n\nHow would you feel if she bought you cheap supermarket own brand beer instead of the premium brand you like\n\nCheaper products don't generally taste as good, or are of even a similar quality. Cleaning products are generally not as good and last less time making them a false economy.\n\nYou need to apologise and grovel if necessary for the nasty name and jibe about her ex and promise you will never do this again. re do the shopping if necessary", "YTA and she's not wrong, you should look for an apartment...\n\nWhy do you want your meager finances weighed down by her THREE children and inconsiderate spending habits?", "Info: does buying the brands she usually does create financial issues? Basically; can you two afford it?\n\nA lot if the times there's reasons why people buy brand name items. For example;\n\nThe brand of chocolate milk we buy tastes by far and large so much better than the cheaper kinds it's insane.\n\nThe brands of pasta sauce we buy don't only taste better than the cheaper stuff, but they're also healthier and contain far less sugar and salt than the cheaper stuff.\n\nThe brand of apples I buy may not be the cheapest (also not the most expensive), but they taste far better than the watery cheaper apples.\n\nSame for clothes, I try to find a balance between costs and quality.\nThe cheaper clothes might cost less but they might also not fit right, shrink too much after a few washes, fade too much after washing or tare too fast. If I buy those, I'd be spending more money on clothes over time than I would if I bought a little higher quality of clothes. \n\nSo if you're not getting in any financial trouble by buying those brands, sit down and have a conversation with your wife about why she likes them and what you like(don't focus too much on \"it's just cheaper\", come up with actual reasons about the quality and/or taste) and just keep buying them or find a compromise on the things you disagree on.\n\nIf you are getting into financial trouble by buying them, still sut down with her and talk about the finances and that you should try replacing them by good but cheaper alternatives. It's trial and error to find something you like, but still.\n\n\nBut what you don't do is call her names. Dude. You're a teacher.

Secondly YTA for the way you handled such a trivial dispute", "Y A probably T A, but I will reserve judgement. It truly depends. Did she ask for cheddar and you bought American cheese? Did she ask for Hellman\u2019s Mayo and you bought the store brand? Did she ask for Bluebell ice cream and you bought store brand? Did she ask for specific brands the kids like and you got generic? We try to be very frugal and have a grocery rule: If there is a cheaper/generic option, we will try it. If we don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll stick with the name brand. We have often been pleasantly surprised and have switched to the cheapest options for many things. (Our store\u2019s cheapest brand feta is AWESOME and I will buy nothing else!) However, the cheapest options of some products are just terrible. The cheapest chicken nuggets, for example, are horrible. My kids won\u2019t touch them. The meat is brown/grey. We buy the more expensive, white meat option. If a person is a Hellman\u2019s or Duke\u2019s mayo person, there is no alternate option. Some store brands of specific cheeses can be just as good as the name brand. Switching to a different type of cheese, though, is unacceptable. Some of these things might have been for recipes and getting an off brand will screw it all up. Kids can be picky and will not eat different brands or want to take specific brands in lunches. If your wife wrote down specific name brands, you know that is what she wanted you to buy. If you want to try the cheaper stuff, have a discussion about it. That\u2019s the bottom line.

I (35M) was asked to go some major grocery shopping for my wife (36F). We have been married for about 8 months and she has 3 young children from a previous marriage. She gave me a long grocery list and I bought what she wanted. However, instead of the specific brands she wanted that she put in the list, I just bought what was cheapest. She was really upset about this, saying there were certain brands she likes to buy. I thought this was ridiculous and we got into an argument about it. Keep in mind we are both on teachers' salaries. Her ex-husband is a businessman and she doesn't seem to realize she isn't married to a businessman anymore. I called her a nasty name and she told me I need to go look for an apartment.

Her for not listing the brands, you for calling her a nasty name.", "I am going to hold off judgement because idk what their expense\u2019s actually are. \nI will say i understand where OP is coming from. When it comes to shopping for groceries (which can be expensive) it is better to go with what\u2019s on sale and what\u2019s inexpensive.

Stay classy, Reddit.  \n\n\nThat said... this reads like a whole lot of missing context. Given that, and how you're singling out a single brushstroke on the painting of your marriage for judgement is a bit... concerning. I don't know how we can judge this without knowing the general financial stability of your home, how income and expenses (and housework/workplace workload is broken down), etc.   \n\n\nIf you both are on such different pages about money, well you probably need to start with financial counselling and possibly couple's counseling as you two don't seem to disagree well. I say financial first because it feels like you need to get on the same page there before anything; it IS one of the leading causes of divorce after all.   \n\n\nAnd don't resort to name calling if you don't want to escalate. You're the AH for that, be better if you want to stay married.", "She has 3 prior kids? Ya, maybe divorcing would be in your best interest. Let the gal work her way into debt.

My mom and me wanted to make some dessert, we bought mascarpone cheese and out of 4 of them only one was good for this. Other ones were just trash. Sometimes brand do matter.

Where was that delicacy and restraint earlier, champ?", "Store brand dish soap can never compare to Dawn Dish soap.
