My MIL only buys one brand of cornflakes, she needs gluten-free and whilst there are alternatives to her preferred brand, they aren\u2019t the same. The fact that her brand is not sold in many supermarkets complicates things even further. Plus it is the cheapest gf cornflakes and ORGANIC makes it even more difficult to get. We have even discussed with one of the supermarkets whether ordering it online would solve our difficulties to be told \u201coh no, we substitute\u201d.

You buy the Target brand because it's cheaper.\n\nIf you compared the sugar content, side by side, you'd see that the Target brand has 10 Grams more sugar per serving than Welch's.\n\nYour wife specified the brand for a reason. 10grams more sugar, means more sugar for the children.

We don't have a lot of money, but there are things that I refuse to skimp on because of quality. Dish soap, laundry soap, pads, tampons, shampoo, etc. Sometimes even foods like certain soups, ravioli, coffee and tea. Cheap is great, but if it tastes like shit is it really a good deal? Same for dish soap. You'll have to pry my Dawn and Platinum Cascade from my cold dead hands, store brands simply do not compare. I know this because I tried them.

You don't think she's tried off-brand cereal?   \n\nKids are notoriously picky eaters, and the cheap brand isn't worth the 0.40 cents you saved. \n\nLaundry detergent, soap, and bodily products are often chosen based on the families' dermatological needs. \n\nIs the 0.40 cents worth this argument? I think not. \n\nIt's fine. You tried to save money and you didn't get the \"gold star\" of approval you wanted OP.  Don't double down on your decision.

This escalation immediately makes me think that you have insecurities about her former spouse, your lower salary, feeling inadequate in your new role as stepfather/other head of household. She specified brands on the list and you decided to override her decisions because you thought you knew better. You vetoed her specifications without consultation, and made the overarching choice as supreme decision maker. When called out on it, you had to defend your authority and assert your budgeting intelligence by cutting her down in a childish manner. \n\nThis isn't about the groceries and brands.

Here is an example of why the cheaper brand  can end up costing more. Cheap one-ply  toilet paper costs less than Brand 2-ply toilet paper. But you need twice as much Cheap as  Brand when you use it.

The solution to this is a compromise, both parties are happy/unhappy with.\n\nThis sort of thing escalating to this level tells me there must be something else wrong (camel's back situation).

Brand loyalty is important to most women.\n\nHow would you feel if she bought you cheap supermarket own brand beer instead of the premium brand you like\n\nCheaper products don't generally taste as good, or are of even a similar quality. Cleaning products are generally not as good and last less time making them a false economy.\n\nYou need to apologise and grovel if necessary for the nasty name and jibe about her ex and promise you will never do this again. re do the shopping if necessary", "YTA and she's not wrong, you should look for an apartment...\n\nWhy do you want your meager finances weighed down by her THREE children and inconsiderate spending habits?", "Info: does buying the brands she usually does create financial issues? Basically; can you two afford it?\n\nA lot if the times there's reasons why people buy brand name items. For example;\n\nThe brand of chocolate milk we buy tastes by far and large so much better than the cheaper kinds it's insane.\n\nThe brands of pasta sauce we buy don't only taste better than the cheaper stuff, but they're also healthier and contain far less sugar and salt than the cheaper stuff.\n\nThe brand of apples I buy may not be the cheapest (also not the most expensive), but they taste far better than the watery cheaper apples.\n\nSame for clothes, I try to find a balance between costs and quality.\nThe cheaper clothes might cost less but they might also not fit right, shrink too much after a few washes, fade too much after washing or tare too fast. If I buy those, I'd be spending more money on clothes over time than I would if I bought a little higher quality of clothes. \n\nSo if you're not getting in any financial trouble by buying those brands, sit down and have a conversation with your wife about why she likes them and what you like(don't focus too much on \"it's just cheaper\", come up with actual reasons about the quality and/or taste) and just keep buying them or find a compromise on the things you disagree on.\n\nIf you are getting into financial trouble by buying them, still sut down with her and talk about the finances and that you should try replacing them by good but cheaper alternatives. It's trial and error to find something you like, but still.\n\n\nBut what you don't do is call her names. Dude. You're a teacher.

Secondly YTA for the way you handled such a trivial dispute", "Y A probably T A, but I will reserve judgement. It truly depends. Did she ask for cheddar and you bought American cheese? Did she ask for Hellman\u2019s Mayo and you bought the store brand? Did she ask for Bluebell ice cream and you bought store brand? Did she ask for specific brands the kids like and you got generic? We try to be very frugal and have a grocery rule: If there is a cheaper/generic option, we will try it. If we don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll stick with the name brand. We have often been pleasantly surprised and have switched to the cheapest options for many things. (Our store\u2019s cheapest brand feta is AWESOME and I will buy nothing else!) However, the cheapest options of some products are just terrible. The cheapest chicken nuggets, for example, are horrible. My kids won\u2019t touch them. The meat is brown/grey. We buy the more expensive, white meat option. If a person is a Hellman\u2019s or Duke\u2019s mayo person, there is no alternate option. Some store brands of specific cheeses can be just as good as the name brand. Switching to a different type of cheese, though, is unacceptable. Some of these things might have been for recipes and getting an off brand will screw it all up. Kids can be picky and will not eat different brands or want to take specific brands in lunches. If your wife wrote down specific name brands, you know that is what she wanted you to buy. If you want to try the cheaper stuff, have a discussion about it. That\u2019s the bottom line.

I (35M) was asked to go some major grocery shopping for my wife (36F). We have been married for about 8 months and she has 3 young children from a previous marriage. She gave me a long grocery list and I bought what she wanted. However, instead of the specific brands she wanted that she put in the list, I just bought what was cheapest. She was really upset about this, saying there were certain brands she likes to buy. I thought this was ridiculous and we got into an argument about it. Keep in mind we are both on teachers' salaries. Her ex-husband is a businessman and she doesn't seem to realize she isn't married to a businessman anymore. I called her a nasty name and she told me I need to go look for an apartment.

In school, we put,bullies in time out. Time to go sit in the naughty corner and write some lines. You also got a fail on your shopping assignment. Please repeat the grade.", "Yeah, YTA a whole lot.", "YTA", "Easy YTA\n\nIt\u2019s be one thing to have an adult conversation about whether or not the family should pay extra for specific brands, calling her nasty names because her opinion is different than yours is uncalled for", "You don\u2019t even want to type it here, but you\u2019re comfortable calling your wife that when she (rightly) points out that you botched the errand?\n\nDefinitely YTA.", "Calling your wife a b\\*tch over a dumb fight about groceries is actually b\\*tch behavior. You're projecting. You are not mature enough for marriage.", "Wow you\u2019re pretty thick in the head for a teacher.", "Ahh, that's usually a non starter. For that YTA, however if this is a one off situation then communicate with love and respect. And don't do it again! I hope everything works out in everyone's best interest.", "She should divorce you\n\nYTA", "Oh, then I love she wanted you to leave. That's good on her for not being willing to deal with a verbally abusive and immature partner.", "Its a joint household, joint income, joint expense so he does if buying more expensive brands creates debt.", "it also depend on country like where I live stuff have gotten expensive as hell and brands are as much crazy that's why I'm asking brand I might have forgotten to ask the country tho", "Oh, I briefly dated a teacher who spoke to people this way. He was great with kids and horrible with everyone else. We were done after a few short weeks. I totally believe this guy could be a teacher.", "I feel like this is true for most cereal. Store brand cereal usually tastes like cardboard. I'd rather have something totally different than a store version of my preferred cereal.", "swiffer is one of mine. i tried buying store brand and was shocked at the difference.\n\nsome things- like toilet paper- i'm perfectly happy, or even prefer store brand.", "Also unlike many of the \"off brand\" oat circle cereals, Cheerios is certified gluten free.", "Yeah, 8 months is a very long time for never having done the groceries. If my husband called me a b**ch for pointing out he didn\u2019t follow the list I took a lot of time making (hello mental charge!) I\u2019d tell him to find a new place too.", "Depending on what he called her, it might have been an honest dealbreaker.", "He sounds like a 13 yr. old, not 35.", "Somehow I suspect he will be eating some of that food, so he was doing it for himself.", "The teacher did *not* understand the assignment.", "There wasn\u2019t even discussion around compromise . He made the decision  and called her ridiculous and verbally abused her when she called him out on it", "No, if it's a Joint household\n\n\nThen it's a Joint decision on what gets brought,", "Absolutely and there are some brands that while they are significantly better --I'm looking at you Rao's pasta sauce-- I only splurge occasionally and only if it's on sale.", "Oh he called her a b**ch, it\u2019s he\u2019s only comment", "Especially if he brought yucky brands nobody will eat!", "Underrated comment.", "well ya that's why I didn't give like a judgement yet because like in Canada right now brands are crazy but just a apartment is like twice my paycheck per month so that's why I'm asking such too I don't make massive money but a teacher where I live barely make 2$ more then I do"]}
