That did not, and eventually a year passed. I have seen him pay other people on Venmo, so he must have seen the request. \n\nI brought this situation up to my other friends and said I wanted to text the guy to remind him about the Venmo, but my friends told me I should just drop it, since it\u2019s only two dollars.  They had told me that pestering someone about 2$ was cheap and unnecessary. It was my friend after all, and they argued that friends should spot each other for stuff like this. While this person was in my friend group, I wasn\u2019t particularly close to them, so it\u2019s not like they were ever covering me for anything, nor did I expect them to. I was quite frankly shocked that anyone thought it was ok for someone to just ignore the fact that they owed money, regardless of how small.\n\nI get that it\u2019s only 2$, but that applies both ways. If it\u2019s only 2$ why can\u2019t he pay me?

You can decide what course of action you're going to take because of this, i.e stop being friends with this person or having them buy you something and not paying them back(which could also cause more issues and drama, but it would be fair imo; as long as its the monetary equivalent and you make a point to ask for your 2 bucks back first before you pay him back his ) but you cant keep going on and on about it expecting him to just pay it.
