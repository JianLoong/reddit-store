The problem is that she refuses to take it off before bed and it smudges into all the linen when she sleeps. I\u2019ve tried to talk to her and get her to remove the makeup before bed but she refuses. Today after she left for work I went to the bathroom and found her makeup bag there. I took out her foundation and threw it in the bin. The next morning when she was getting ready for work, she asked me if I had seen her foundation and I replied honestly that I had thrown it away. She went ballistic at me and threw the entire makeup bag at my head. She stormed out of the house and went to work and she hasn\u2019t talked to me since.

I have known her for over 40 years and I have seen her without make-up exactly once. I don't know what the circumstances are with your GF, but she may have something similar. Or she just may not see the big deal. Or want to be pretty for you.

How you feel if she threw away your things just because she was aggravated or mad? That doesn\u2019t give her the right to throw something at your head, but it does justify her not talking to you at all.

Give her the money to replace it.\n\nIt is bad for her skin to sleep in heavy makeup, not to mention the mess on the pillowcases. She seems insecure about her looks or skin.\n\nI don't know if she will talk to you again, the makeup seems to be pivotal to her sense of herself. Maybe she can sleep at her own apartment for a while.", "Not all, but some, some women spend $100 on a bottle of foundation. Some women\u2019s makeup bags hold $1000 worth of makeup.

I would be 100% on your side in that argument, because there's no reason why she should be soiling the sheets. (Not to mention it's bad for her skin health to leave all of that foundation caked on her face 24/7.)\n\nBut your method of dealing with it was passive aggressive and inappropriate. Makeup is expensive, and even if it wasn't expensive, it's an AH move to dispose of someone else's property. There must have been a better solution - maybe ask her to buy her own pillow linens and not allow her to use yours, or agree to make it her chore to clean the bed linens.", "She\u2019s too insecure to let you see her without makeup. It\u2019s unhygienic, but did it ever occur to you that the fact that she won\u2019t talk about it means there\u2019s something a lot deeper going on?\n\nYTA, and not just because you stole her property and threw it away. YTA because your pillowcases and getting your way mean more to you than her trust.", "YTA and most likely the ex. Makeup is incredibly expensive so you owe her possibly around $200 or so. In the future, if you encounter this type of problem, instead of throwing away someone else\u2019s things, go to target and buy a pack of makeup wipes. If she doesn\u2019t want to use them, than she needs to be doing the laundry and buying the linens.", "**YTA** for throwing out something that does not belong to you and was valuable to your GF. \n\nSame as theft.", "YTA! That stuff costs a small fortune!  How would you feel if she threw your stuff away!?", "Just from the title YTA. don't throw away my stuff, ever.

Or her mind, or any other part of her.  You don\u2019t get to control any of it.

You would do better to buy her a night time cleansing balm or oil. Tatcha is a good brand. As a very mature woman, my advice to her would be always wash your makeup off at night. Your skin will be much younger looking when you\u2019re old if you do.", "YTA. It was her property and you stole it and threw it away. That was unkind and immature.", "ESH , While I can understand that wearing the makeup to bed is messy and a bit frustrating\u2026 I don\u2019t think doing the laundry a little more often is equivalent to throwing away your partners personal possessions. You have proven you are untrustworthy and make rash decisions with little care for the outcome. On your girlfriends side lashing out by assaulting your partner is not a good move either and should not be her first reaction. Either you guys need to work on effective and honest communication in a healthy manner so you can talk things out, or walk away from the relationship.", "Why would you *want* to talk to her again?

Hope you've got a spare bunch of cash lying around.  But it is pretty rude to mess up linen you share like that. She also got violent. Not on.", "ESH. I'm sorry she's so inconsiderate, but maybe just ask her to get a special pillowcase / wash the pillowcase instead of throwing her stuff away.  \n\n\nETA from reading more comments: ask her to replace the pillowcases, and if she won't, I wouldn't let her sleep in your bed.", "Dude you don't wanna talk to this one.

Apologize to her buy her what you took from her and try talk to her about taking care of her skin for the night to see if it works! Have you ever seen her without makeup? Or you are in a catfish type of situation?", "Your relationship should be over on both your parts. I hope for both your sakes you split.", "Or tell her to bring her own pillow", "Or break up with her and find a girl who wear\u2019s less makeup.", "I\u2019ve brought it up before but she refused to talk about it at all", "I\u2019d hope we are made for each other I mean she\u2019s the loml man", "This one, and you can buy pillow cases on Amazon cheap too. Buy her pillow cases for her and then keep yours.", "Fr the silk ones are great for avoiding stains, ur skin and hair. Buy her a nice ass one too", "This. This is an example of problem-solving\u2014as opposed to what you did, OP, which is an example of stealing. You have probably lost your GF over *checks notes* pillow cases. YTA", "Wearing makeup is not catfishing, moron.", "Maybe because she doesn\u2019t see you as someone she can feel completely insecure too.  Which, I don\u2019t blame her considering you threw all her make up away rather than be patient with her.", "did you read and understand what i said or did you simply fixate on that?", "Loml? You just had to throw away personal property cause she's the love of your life right? But you're upset she chucked her make up bag at you? 10/10 way to go bro \ud83d\udc4f", "lol jfc, YTA. You\u2019re mad that she \u201cstill wears heavy makeup 10 months in.\u201d \n\nYou don\u2019t love her. You\u2019re in love with having a girlfriend. You don\u2019t even like her if this is how you deal with things.", "You threw away her personal property. I hope you're going to be paying her back before she leaves", "I\u2019d be surprised if you go around throwing out her shit and you turn out to be hers. YTA, man. She isn\u2019t the love of your life if you only respect her when she does what you want her to or speaks on your command."]}
