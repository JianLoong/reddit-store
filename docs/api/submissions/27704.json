I backtracked and said I wasn\u2019t allergic I was just not comfortable with big dogs but her dog was ok. We did go on that date and then dated seriously for a few months.

You can choose to disallow any sort of pets on your property. You can\u2019t fake a medical condition to get your way. \n\nYou have violated your friends\u2019 trust. If you had said from the beginning that you simply don\u2019t like dogs, they probably would\u2019ve been happy to negotiate (and if not, then maybe you were simply incompatible).", "YTA for lying. There are people with legit allergies, but no one believes us because of folks like you.

You lied to your date because she wouldn\u2019t have dated you if you\u2019d told the truth (which strictly speaking negates consent, though it\u2019s a side-issue since she ditched you). And then you got caught and you\u2019re still trying to lie your way out of it.\n\nYour boundary should have been reasonable but you didn\u2019t actually tell anyone about your boundary or try to enforce it, you just set up a false boundary as a blatant power play instead of going and finding friends you actually liked and had things in common with.\n\nThe issue here is not dogs in your car. It\u2019s dogs in your life in any context - your car is a reasonable line to draw but having friends who almost all have dogs and then trying to keep dogs out of your entire life is a weird attempt to control others instead of just avoiding that situation yourself by finding other friends.

It\u2019s also one thing to lie about yourself (being allergic) but when your lies spread and start involving other people it\u2019s a problem. \n\nAside from that the relationship was pretty much doomed from the beginning - with dogs being banned from you property moving in together would be impossible unless she got rid of the dog and that was never going to happen, so how exactly did you see this working out?", "YTA, quit lying, man up and say you don't like dogs or animals in your car.", "I almost went with N A H, but I am sorry to say that this is a YTA situation.

You're just obviously not someone she wants to share a future with. \n\nI would not be with someone who kinda \"tolerates\" my dog while being a jerk about it. It's important that my wife loves our animals as much as I do.", "If it's time to consider moving in together, she knows that there will be no compromise from you regarding the dog.\n\nPersonally, I think she's a smart person. She understands that she wants a boyfriend who enjoys dogs as much as she does.\n\nETA: and, yes, YTA. Mostly for being a liar.", "Because you\u2019re old enough that marriage, or at least building a life together, becomes a natural goal in relationships. There\u2019s no point of spending more time dating you if she knows she\u2019s not willing to budge about dogs. Her breaking up with you WAS her respecting your boundaries.", "Completely wrong.
