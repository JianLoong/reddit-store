My nephew loves Maverick and always begs my sister and BIL to let him visit us so he can play with Maverick.\n\nMy gf sleeps with Maverick pretty much every night. She claims she has a hard time sleeping without him. My nephew was recently diagnosed with Epilepsy and has several seizures a day. He has been trying different drugs to see which would work. He was suppose to come over and visit us last week but my sister didn\u2019t want him to travel in case he had another one.\n\nI had a few days off then anyway and asked my gf is I could take her dog and drive the 4h to visit him and surprise him with Maverick. I already checked with my sister who said he would be so happy since he has been sad at missing school and seeing his friends do to his health problems. \n\nI asked my gf who said she didn\u2019t want him going with me because she wanted to keep him by her side and she has problems sleeping without him. I told her she should come with me to my sister\u2019s place and bring Maverick along but she said she already bought lift tickets to go skiing with her friends. The fact she would choose to go skiing with her friends over spending time with a sick kid is pretty selfish to me.\n\nI took Maverick with me to visit my sister and left my gf a message saying he\u2019s fine and we will be back the next day. She called me to scream at me to bring him back and I told her I was halfway there already and I\u2019ll bring him back. She didn\u2019t say another word and when we got to my sister\u2019s place my nephew was so happy and spent the evening cuddling Maverick. \n\nI brought him home like I said I would and already had her bags packed and immediately loaded Maverick in her car and drove off. I know she\u2019s mad at me but I think she is overreacting to spending 1 night away from her dog. It\u2019s been a few days and she\u2019s ignored my calls and texts.", "created_utc": 1672686244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101kko2/aita_for_taking_my_gfs_dog_without_her_permission/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s dog for one, and she literally has trouble sleeping without him.  Why are you entitled to your girlfriend coming with you to see YOUR nephew?  That\u2019s not her obligation at all.  I\u2019m sure she booked her skiing trip well in advance, canceling on her friends for this wouldn\u2019t have made sense.  \n\nSo where on earth you decided that running off with her own dog that she loves and can\u2019t sleep without was a logical and moral choice, flabbergasts me.  This is after you asked and received direct orders not to run off with him.  You\u2019re girlfriend correctly has reached the conclusion that a partner who\u2019d make a choice like that isn\u2019t a beneficial one.  YTA.  I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you, I really shouldn\u2019t, but this was a terrifically terrible thing you did.  You are an asshole.", "YTA.\n\nYou stole her dog dude. What the hell is wrong with you ?\n\nI would have called the cops on your ass.\n\nYou can stop calling her your GF and start calling her your ex.", "YTA. You fucking stole her dog and you have the audacity to say she's selfish? WTF is wrong with you.", "YTA - you took her dog after she specifically told you you couldn\u2019t? YOU STOLE HER DOG!!! I would lose my mind. If I were her I would file a police report and never speak to you again.", "YTA\n\nMaverick is not a medical service dog for your nephew. They have to be trained for that. It's HER dog, not yours.", "YTA You asked, she said NO. That should have been the end of it. Instead you stole, yes stole her dog to take him far away from her. The circumstances on your end don't matter. You're a thief. You stole a living creature from its owner.", "YTA\n\nEverything you describe is fully in the knowledge that you should not do it. You had no permission, you had the opposite of permission.\n\nYou are an asshole because you totally ignored the reasons given being your GF's needs because you took it on yourself to judge her selfish for your own selfish behaviour.\n\nWhat a total asshole you are for doing this and also trying to paint her as selfish 'because of a sick kid'. You are not the hero for robbing her peace 'to make a kid happy'.", "YTA. Its not about spending a night away from her dog, its about you TAKING her dog without permission.\n\nEvery dog person I know would dump you for that.\n\nETA. four hours. Do you even know if the dog gets carsick? Did you have an appropriate enclosure in your vehicle? I know three people who have lost animals after minor car wrecks, so sticking the dog in the backseat isn't an option. Do you know if the dog would listen to you? If the dog likes children, or is afraid of them? If the dog needs any special food? Or did you just throw him in the car and think you'd be the hero here?\n\nYou're the worst. Just the absolute worst.", "YTA. You asked permission, she said no and then you proceeded to steal her dog. She should have called the cops on you", "You knew about her difficulties sleeping without her dog, you planned a trip with her dog without consulting her (you know, the ACTUAL owner of the dog), she outright said \u2018NO\u2019 when you finally deigned to tell her what you had planned for HER DOG, you called her selfish for not agreeing to your plan, and then you went ahead and STOLE her dog anyway. \n\nYou\u2019re an AH for even doubting that YTA.", "YTA dude it\u2019s not your dog. You just committed theft after being explicitly told you couldn\u2019t take her dog. Expect the next thing you here from her to be that you\u2019re breaking up, you\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t report her dog stolen. Quite classy to call her selfish for not abandoning her plans with friends while you\u2019re literally stealing from her. I\u2019m glad you seem to care about your nephew, but you need to learn to see women as actual people instead of lesser things that you can use and abuse, whose thoughts and feelings currently don\u2019t matter to you in the slightest. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you end up in prison in the next few years if you keep acting like this.", "YTA. This is her dog, not yours. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t report the pet abduction to the police. If your nephew needs a companion so badly, his parents should adopt one. If someone took my dog after I said \u201cno\u201d, they would be dead to me.", "YTA\n\nMaverick is your (perhaps soon to be ex-) girlfriend's dog, not yours. You don't get to take things that aren't yours, even if your nephew loves the dog. What part of this don't you comprehend?\n\nYour girlfriend is also entitled to keep her skiing engagement.", "Seriously?  YTA.  She's reacting because she said NO and YOU DID IT ANYWAY.  The little poke about her skiing trip suggests you were possibly trying to punish her for what you perceived to be a selfish decision.  How is that selfish?  She'd already paid for the ticket.  The kid is sick, not dying (I assume).  She's not obligated to pay special attention to your nephew, and it's 100% inappropriate to use HER DOG for your purposes without her explicit permission.  Don't be surprised if she ignores your calls and texts forever now.", "YTA, she said no, you decided to do it anyways. She's not over reacting to you taking the dog for one night. She's reacting appropriately to someone expressly ignoring what they were told and not caring about her comfort vs entertaining a third party. The third party being a sick kid does not change the fact that it's not your dog.", "YTA. \n\nYou stole her dog. You are lucky she didn't call the police. Your nephew is not entitled to your girlfriend's dog. If he wants/needs a dog your sister can get him one. You were told no and no is a complete sentence. \n\nAnd you should say ex-girlfriend because she has dumped you.", "yta\n\nhonestly, if this was me, i had called the cops on you. you bloody *stole* her dog!! what the fuck were you thinking whats going to happen?! Maverick isnt a trained service dog, the only selfish person here is you.", "YTA. I knew when you said she \u201cclaims\u201d to have a hard time sleeping without him. Then it just kept coming. You abducted her dog, ignored her request, and have the audacity to play the \u201cit\u2019s for a kid!\u201d card? I hope she dumps your butt.", "YTA. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t call the cops since you literally STOLE her dog.", "You stole her dog. Taking a dog without her permission, no matter the reason, is stealing, even if it's just a day.\n\nI have nothing more to say that YTA here.", "YTA. Your the selfish one not her. It sucks your nephew has epilepsy, but that doesn't mean you can just take someones dog. Especially as you know how much she needs it. Hope she breaks up with you.", "You stole her dog and you treat her like a pet. Super YTA", "YTA - and you don\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore thief.", "YTA. I would\u2019ve called the police and had you arrested", "YTA. You took HER dog without permission when she had categorically stated not to do so. I would dump you in a heartbeat for that. You are a colossal AH.", "#YOU STOLE HER DOG AFTER SHE SAID NO\n\nWhat you did was stealing. Theft. Took without permission.\n\nI think you\u2019re now an ex. \n\nYTA", "YTA - Maverick belongs to your girlfriend.  Your girlfriend needs Maverick at night.  She said, \"No.\"  You decided to take Maverick anyway.  You stole her dog.", "Easy peasy. YTA. \n\nTaking someone's dog without their consent is terrible any way you cut it. It's made even worse when she explicitly said no.\n\nEdit:  If an animal's welfare is on the line - it would be ok to take someone's pet.", "YTA. You stole her dog. Visiting a sick kid does not \u201ctrump\u201d plans she already had. She said no. Your lucky she didn\u2019t call the police in you. I only hope your EX girlfriend is smart and never returns your calls or texts again.", "YTA. That\u2019s HER dog. She was far nicer than I would have been to you.", "Yta wtf dude", "YTA NOT YOUR DOG.", "Dude, you can't just take someone's dog. YTA. Thief.", "You do understand what you did was illegal right?\u2026.come on..", "YTA she is underreacting to you STEALING her dog and now you and the kid can kiss Maverick goodbye forever. I'd have called the cops.", "YTA, you ignored her wishes. It\u2019s not like you were borrowing a toy or something.", "Woah you\u2019re a huge asshole\u2026 and probably single now too. Nice job dummy", "YTA it's her dog. And your reasons isn't good enough.She was far more kinder then I would have done. I would have called the cops on you and dumped you..", "YTA.  And a single one at that.  I applaud your ex-gf for dumping you - it\u2019s SO deserved.\n\nUntil you understand that No means NO, do not date any more women.", "> she already bought lift tickets    \n    \nYTA. She had already purchased the tickets, so it's not her choosing her friends over your nephew. It's you minimizing your girlfriend's needs.", "YTA.\n\nShe should break up with you.  You specifically disregarded a boundary about her companion animal, who she probably loves more than you (and rightly so!).\n\nI would go full John Wick in her position.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your dog. \nShe could have pressed charges for animal theft.", "Obvious YTA. Not sure how you think you aren't. You abducted her freaking dog.", "YTA You stole her dog. If it was me, I wouldn\u2019t come back.", "YTA and single   \ncongrats", "YTA\n\nShe told you no.\n\nWhat other no of her do you ignore?", "Wow... I personally would have drove to your sister's to retrieve my dog!! That being said, I see she made good use of her time and packed, now that she knows you have zero respect for her and her boundaries. \n\nYTA - a massive one.", "YTA. Post title should've been \"aita for taking my ex-gf's dogs after I asked for permission and she said no?\"\n\nI think it's very uncool to call her selfish for \"choosing to go skiing over spending time with a sick kid.\" Bruh, that sick kid is *your* nephew, not hers; and he has a lifelong condition, not a terminal illness. That just seems tacked on to make her look worse, which didn't work at all.\n\nSo, if I'd been her, and just had my partner straight up ignore me when I say no, and also expect me to drop my life and plans just to hang out with their family because one of them has a condition... Well, I'd be packing my stuff and leaving, too.", "Think she's your EX-gf now. Nobody wants a manipulative, controlling thief for a BF. YTA", "YTA. You had no right to take her dog without permission. Have you not seen John Wick? Ppl don\u2019t play about their pets.", "YTA. You can't just take someone's dog without permission, even if you think it's for a good cause. She told you that you couldn't take her dog but you deliberately went and did it anyway. It doesn't matter that you only took him for a day. You stole your gf's dog and are surprised that she is pissed at you for it. To put it in perspective, how would you feel if she took something important of yours, like your car, without your permission after you already told her no?", "YTA. You took her choice away and made it for her since you didn\u2019t like what she wanted. You gave her a glimpse of what it would be like to live under your thumb and she said no thanks.", "YTA. Now that you are single because of the dognapping, you will probably have time to invest in helping your nephew or just keeping him company. Look into service dogs that can detect seizures, if it\u2019s feasible for his family to get one.", "YTA I hope it\u2019s ex girlfriend now. She\u2019s better than me because I would have called the cops on your thieving ass.", "YTA and your gf should break up with you.\n\nIt's not your dog or the kids. It's hers.\n\n You don't listen. You thieved her dog and just generally sound like a massive A", "Yta you asked, she said no, and you took the dog anyways.  That's literally stealing.", "YTA. She literally already told you no. And considering it\u2019s your nephew, not your girlfriends, I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re all bent out of shape she had previous plans. Honestly, if it were me, that would be the day I tell you not to let the door hit you in the ass on the way out", "YTA. Would it be nice for you and your gf to visit your nephew with Maverick? Of course. And you could have done that in future at a time that worked better for your gf. Epilepsy is a long-term diagnosis; he will be learning to deal with it throughout his life. An immediate visit wasn't needed, and she certainly isn't 'selfish' for having other plans. Someone is definitely being thoughtless and selfish here, but it ain't your gf.\n\nHe is NOT your dog. She said no. I would have called the police on you.", "Hope you\u2019re ready to explain to your sick nephew why he\u2019s never seeing Maverick ever again. YTA.", "YTA- do you generally struggle this much with the concept of consent?", "YTA\u2014this isn\u2019t about the dog. It\u2019s because you basically ignored her NO answer and if you\u2019ll do this about a dog you\u2019ll do it throughout the relationship because you think you know better", "YTA. She had already bought the skiing tickets. It\u2019s her dog, and she said no. You completely disrespected her decision over HER pet and took him anyways. It\u2019s HER dog and that\u2019s final.", "YTA. How do you think what you did was even a tiny bit okay? Sounds like she\u2019s done with you and rightfully so.", "I feel like I'm piling on here because it's quite obvious to everyone except you, but clearly CLEARLY YTA. And this girl is your ex, in case that also wssn't clear.", "YTA- I would have had you arrested.", "Your ex (I suspect) said \"no\" and you should have respected that.\n\nI feel sorry for the kid, but this was theft nonetheless. \n\nYTA", "[removed]", "NO means NO! You stole HER dog. \n\nWhat made you think taking HER dog to see YOUR nephew without permission is acceptable?\n\nMavrick isn't a service dog and has no training plus your (most likely ex) girlfriend has trouble sleeping without HER dog. \n\nIm sorry your nephew isn't well but that's not on your girlfriend. She is not selfish for not cancelling her ski trip with her friends. If your nephew needs a dog so bad your sister needs to get him a service dog.\n\nYou took a living creature away from it's primary caregiver which is wrong on all different levels. \n\nYTA and that's putting it mildly.", "YTA. Your gf didn\u2019t leave due to an overreaction\u2026she left because you totally disregarded her feelings and her authority over her property. You. Disregarded. Her. You decided you knew better\u2026that what you wanted to do took precedence. You took her dog AFTER she told you no. You realize she could have had you charged with theft?", "YTA\n\nYou asked and she said no. Taking Maverick after the legal owner said no was the wrong choice. This relationship is over. I hope your nephew at least had fun, because neither you nor he will ever see that dog again.", "YTA. You stole her dog.You asked. She said no. You took him anyway.  She isn\u2019t ignoring. She is dumping you.", "YTA. It\u2019s her dog not yours. And for the record your nephew is not sick. Your nephew has epilepsy and they are trying to find a drug that will control the seizures. My kid has epilepsy too\u2026she\u2019s not sick.  You can\u2019t steal other peoples dogs bro.", "YTA\n\nMaverick is her dog, she told you not to take him with you, you took him regardless. And now she has dumped you. Good on her, she deserves better.", "YTA. She said no and you did it anyway.", "It was so kind of you to show her you don't care about how her feelings and you wants come before hers.   YTA.", "YTA asshole. She\u2019s \u2018selfish\u2019? You are one delusional dog thief.", "YTA. And I hope she sees the red flag that you don't take 'no' for an answer and will take what you want when you want it. Because that's definitely what she wants in a life partner... Jeez dude...", "Real question: AITA for STEALING my girlfriend\u2019s emotional support animal?\n\nThe answer? YTA. You should be grateful you only left this situation single as opposed to in jail for theft. I\u2019d have called the police as soon as I realized you took my dog. She\u2019s not gonna call you back.", "You know YTA. \n\nYou asked.  She said no. No is a complete fucking sentence. The fact that you think you know better than she does about her OWN DAMN DOG tells her everything she needs to know about the level of respect you have for her. \n\nI hope she leaves your ass for someone who treats her like a person.", "YTA. You essentially \u201cdognapped\u201d Maverick. You don\u2019t seem to understand the gravity of what you did because your nephew was \u201chappy\u201d. \n\nAlso, if she had plans already why can\u2019t you understand her decision NOT to go with you.  She was well within her rights to be upset and leave.", "You are a colossal AH for this. You stole her dog, cut and dry. She verbally said no to you taking him and you did anyway. I would have called police on you asap if you\u2019d done that to me. I\u2019m hopeful she doesn\u2019t stay in a relationship with you because you cannot be trusted in the slightest.", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t your dog and she told you you couldn\u2019t take him and you did it anyway. What is so hard about understanding that? You think she is selfish for not dropping her prearranged plans to visit your family just because you decided to go? You\u2019re selfish to not consider her plans and feelings. \n\nDid it ever occur to you that your girlfriend might sleep with a big dog because she\u2019s scared of break ins?!  Women are OFTEN told to get dogs for home security. Why do you think she sleeps better with him there?", "YTA, it is not your place to take a dog that doesn't belong to you. The one being selfish here is you. You do not get to do that. I understand the kid is sick, but his epilepsy doesn't entitle him to a dog that doesn't belong to you.", "YTA \n\nShe told you not to take her dog. You stole her dog, plain and simple.", "YTA. She said no and you went against her knowing that it was important to her.\n\nShe\u2019s seen those red flags from you and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be coming back", "YTA. You took her dog after she said no.", "YTA and a thief. You stole her dog after she told you no. It\u2019s HER dog!

I would have called the police.", "YTA - You're lucky she didn't call the police on you.

He just misses him but your ex needs him to have peaceful nights.\n\nMaybe consider she can't sleep well because she had trauma and her dog lets her feel safe?\n\nYou ignored your ex s/o comfort, boundaries and stole something what belongs to her for a child. THAT IS SELFISH.\n\nShe is not selfish for not wanting to visit a sick child she not feels connected to just yet. \n\nWhy not just buy your nephew his own dog instead of steeling someone elses dog?\n\nHope she reports ya for theft.", "I hope she is your ex now.

If your nephew had developed epilepsy and you didn't have access to a cool dog, do you think that nothing else would have calmed your nephew down? Your nephew is not the only child with epilepsy. Maverick is not the only Australian Shepherd. People find ways to make things work with the resources they actually have every day. So what is driving your desperate need to be the hero here? Why do YOU have to be the one who swoops in to save the day for this little boy even if it means being a dog thief? Because let's be honest - you weren't through, were you? If your (ex)gf hadn't taken Maverick with her, you would be trying to guilt trip her into giving Maverick to your nephew, right? What have you done that you need to atone for with this microwave cure - meaning you would short circuit the process of finding and training an appropriate dog for your nephew by just taking someone else's dog? I feel like there is more going on for you here than what has been said.\n\nAs much as it's good to help your nephew, your (ex)gf does not owe it to you to pay your emotional debts.

Your significant other (SO) does not. Your SO has some scheme to take your pet far, far away for a period of time you cannot guarantee they'll stick to. It has to be noted again that your SO, for some reason, does not have a pet of their own, which makes you feel even uneasier about how yours could be treated. You instruct them not to take your pet, but your SO sneaks into your residence and abducts your dog anyway, literally committing a crime.  They then ignore your request to return their dog while they still aren't that far away.\n\nWouldn't you think that your SO, who is also accusing you of being selfish and overreacting, is an AH?

Taking something without permission is stealing. If you took my dog, I\u2019d have called the cops on you. Do you even know if the dog has any special needs or meds? Did you buckle the dog in?

I'm sorry about the health issues of your nephew but you had no right to take her dog after she told you no.

From the look of it you weren't even prepared to fully take care of the dog, it was just for your nephew who is not entitled to have her dog on a whim. He is not a support dog and had you talked things out with your girlfriend prior to planning the trip, she might have agreed.  \n\nYour gf does not have to justify why she'd rather go on something she had planned in advance with her friends and your nephew can wait another day.

And you now have an ex-GF.", "YTA since you don\u2019t get it, let\u2019s try flipping the script:\n\nSay you have a supercar and love to take it to the track every night. Your girlfriend\u2019s nephew is obsessed with your car and wants to come to track day with you all the time. Now he\u2019s sick & in sore need of cheering up, and she has a few days off & asks to take your supercar to them for a track night. You said no because you want to keep it safe, and can\u2019t go a night without it (you don\u2019t have to race but she *has* to sleep), and besides you have plans. She thinks you are a ridiculous selfish AH for depriving a sick kid and it\u2019s Only For One Night, especially when you won\u2019t cancel on your friends to see the kid. When you get home from work, the car is gone. You call her, demand she brings it back, and she blows you off saying she\u2019s half way there and will come back tomorrow. Shouldn\u2019t you be proud: the kid was so happy and spent the whole race night in the passenger seat. You\u2019re pissed off that she lied to and stole from you, and when she gets back, you take it and the rest of your stuff somewhere she can\u2019t steal it.\n\nIt\u2019s just a car, not even an emotional support animal: why are you so angry about not having it for only one night? You spent the day with friends anyway so why do you care? Why don\u2019t you just get over it and make up with the thieving liar?", "You committed a crime by stealing her dog. You didn\u2019t borrow it; you stole it. I would\u2019ve sent the cops after you. Her dog didn\u2019t belong anywhere near your sick nephew. he needs a service animal.

I would have shown up at your sister\u2019s house with the cops and had you arrested for theft. Because you\u2019re a thief. \n\nYou think she\u2019s selfish for not wanting to visit a sick kid. How many sick kids did you spend time with before your nephew got sick? You have a vested interest in this sick kid. She had plans and no obligation to him, your sister or really even you. If your nephew wants a dog to spend time with, his parents should get him one. Your girlfriend owes him nothing but has been kind to let him enjoy his company. What if something had happened to the dog on your little trip? \n\nI have a diabetic dog and while most people know she needs insulin, the only people who take it as serious as it must be and know what symptoms to watch for are my husband and myself. How do you know maverick doesn\u2019t have an issue that your (hopefully now EX) girlfriend is the only one who knows how to manager BECAUSE HES HER DOG? \n\nJesus Christ. Of course you\u2019re the asshole.", "YTA what you did is a crime.", "YTA.  You broke her trust! You showed her that her opinion and feeling don't matter. Pretty sure that's your EX-gf now", "YTA. You also just confessed to a crime. You STOLE her dog. It\u2019s not your dog. You were told no. You don\u2019t respect her boundaries. And I guarantee she\u2019s not your girlfriend anymore", "You deserve to be single, it's not your dog, full stop. Your Ex had nothing to do with your sick nephew, I know it sounds harsh, but if we helped out everyone who needed it we'd have nothing left for ourselves.

Your family can get their own dog for your nephew, not steal someone else\u2019s.", "You really have to ask this? YTA!!! You not only destroyed boundaries she placed, you abducted her dog! She said no. No means no!

You kidnapped her dog after she explicitly told you that you weren\u2019t allowed to take him with you.

Im glad she dumped you. YTA\n\nNo means no dude", "YTA.", "YTA. You didn't have permission to take the dog. Also it sounds like that dog is an emotional support animal for her and you removed her access. She should dump you for this.", "YTA. You\u2019re the one who is selfish. She\u2019s now your ex gf & you stole her dog. Get your nephew his own dog if that means so much to you.", "YTA.\n\nJesus Christ OP, you can't just help yourself to your girlfriend's pet. Against her explicit permission, no less. Her anger at you is NOT an \"overreaction.\" That's exactly how someone typically reacts when you steal their dog!\n\nDo you think that you're the main character, or something? Your choices are the only ones that matter?", "YTA. You literally stole her dog... to take it to visit a kid hours away. I would also have packed my bags and left ASAP. Your lack of respect for ANY boundaries is a huge issue, and I'm absolutely *certain* you did this knowing it would be an issue, but wanted to punish her for having the sheer nerve to have a social outing instead of spending every free second with your nephew.\n\nIt's sweet you like him that much, but not everyone does or needs to.\n\nCount yourself lucky your EX is nicer than I am, because I'd have absolutely left fish to rot in your vents too.", "YTA. \n\nIf I was your gf I'd give up a good night of sleep and let you take my dog to your nephew to brighten his day. A lousy night would be worth it. \n\nBut... she didn't give you permission and you took her dog, her buddy and support, without permission. For that I vote YTA", "YTA. You're lucky your gf is a lot calmer than most dog owners, myself included. \n\nI hope she and Maverick have a wonderful life together without you.", "You disrespect you gf.

It's YOUR FAULT she didn't know about the spontaneous family trip, you didn't tell her until after you made the plan. She was not available. You asked for permission to take Maverick to visit your nephew. She said no. THEN YOU STOLE HER DOG.\n\nI'm glad she left you, she knows she can't trust you anymore.", "YTA - You're The Asshole. You just lost your girlfriend and Maverick.", "YTA. Legally speaking she probably has grounds to sue, not even mentioning your backwards morals.", "YTA. And the red flags are flying. This is about so much more than the dog. She had a boundary and you stomped right over it. Because your view on the matter is right and hers is wrong. Her thoughts and feelings didn\u2019t matter. What you thought and felt was most important. Huge asshole.", "YTA. Period.", "YTA. The entitlement here is beyond my comprehension.

You're not entitled to make your own decisions on her animal. Seriously grow up", "YTA. You took the dog without permission and as as an epileptic that is extremely irresponsible to take a dog to someone having uncontrolled seizures when you have no idea how the dog is likely to react to that. The seizure could have injured dog or nephew if the dog had reacted poorly.", "YTA. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s upset that she spent one night away from the dog. It\u2019s that you STOLE her dog after she told you no. It is her dog, not yours. She said no don\u2019t take the dog. You took it anyway. As far as her going skiing instead of visiting your nephew, she already had plans and paid for those plans.

After all, you only went up because you happened to have time off.", "YTA, obviously. You didn\u2019t just take her dog without her permission, you took him *after* she expressly told you not to. At best, you stole her dog. At worst, you kidnapped her fur baby.

Not to mention how my dog would would react to a carride and overnight away from home/me. \n\nA lot of dogs can't handle being in the car for long periods of time, or at all, without medication. They become very stressed and sick. My dog/mom's dog would get so stressed about having to ride in the car to go to the vet he would vomit just being near the car.

YTA obviously.", "But guys. He brought Maverick back the next like he said he would. That totally makes up for asking permission, not liking the answer, stealing her dog and being pissy towards his (now ex) gf. /s obviously \n\nI would have had the cops ready at the door for when he came home. \n\nOP YTA.\n\nThe only good thing to come out of this is your (now ex) realized you were a liar and couldn't be trusted.", "This is one of the worst posts I\u2019ve ever seen on here.

You could have easily planned the trip at another time when she\u2019s available and able to come. Instead, you decided to prioritize your wants over hers and KIDNAPPED her dog after you\u2019d already been told no. Not your dog, not your choice.

Get your own \n\nYTA", "It also says a lot about how much you respect your girlfriends consent", "Hopefully she dumps you because if you could do this to her dog, you'd do it to your kids. You disrespected her wishes. Better it ends now.", "Also your ex is an angel compared to how most others including me would react", "I love how someone gave a \"wholesome\" award to this, lol.", "Let's face it, I'm sure OP will blame everything on his ex as to why the dog isn't visiting anymore.", "It's full of dogs that can be trained to be actual service dogs for epilepsy too.", "Ay, OP's wants, desires, or in this case what he THINKS is important take precedence over GF's.\nYTA OP.", "Giant, blinking marinara flag right there. \n\nShe does not need to justify her actions to you (going skiing for the day instead of visiting your nephew) and for you to make such decisions without her consent as just a boyfriend and not something more is precisely why you're now n EX boyfriend. \n\nJust know that you'll always be the villain in this story. Always. You're the asshole and you suck.", "I would not be surprised to learn this is not the first of the girlfriend's \"no\"s that have been entirely ignored because \"OP knows best\".", "OP seems the type to just go buy a puppy for the kid without asking the parents and then get confused about why he's not the hero of the situation.", "Notice how he hasn\u2019t noticed she dumped him yet. The boys such a fool he hasn\u2019t realised he\u2019s blocked on everything and he\u2019ll probably never see her again.", "Same. Mine was on prescription food, insulin, and epilepsy meds. Him not getting any of those would result in a very sick doggo and very expensive vet bills", "Also a dog can act very differently without their owner, especially if they have to do something that is stressful like driving long trip without the owner. And sleep without the owner.", "SAME. I think she should have called the police on him.", "I mean, I feel like she did (rightly) leave him? All her stuff was packed up when OP got back and as soon as she had the dog she left.", "Given how he phrased his post and how he behaved, I\u2019m not sure he was actually asking her permission. It feels like he was just telling her what he was going to do just to cover his ass if she did call the police. He could just claim that he had her permission\ud83e\udd14 \n\nBut his phrasing of how she\u2019s \u2018selfish\u2019 for already having plans to go skiing and won\u2019t change them to go visit a sick kid and how she\u2019s \u2019overreacting\u2019 for being away from Maverick for \u2018just one night\u2019\u2026he\u2019s nothing but a field of \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "I definitely got that vibe as well. He gave zero f\u2019s for his gf\u2019s well-being or for Maverick\u2019s\u2026.OP only cared about himself.", "And not to minimize epilepsy, but I have two friends who have it and they are living full and healthy lives. It was a process of getting on the right meds. It is not one of those conditions where you're having to get your affairs in order.", "Not to mention those tickets are never refundable or transferable. It's not like she could have just kept a voucher and gone another time.", "I hope she doesn\u2019t!", "You obviously lack a sense of humour.", "..and he planned the visit last minute without consulting his gf. When she said she can't come because she already has plans he calls her selfish \ud83e\udd28", "Not even just without her consent, but after she has said NO.", ">She does not need to justify her actions to you (going skiing for the day instead of visiting your nephew)\n\nAlso, it's not like he said 'what do you want to do today, A or B?' She'd already made plans! It's pretty common for people to not want to let down friends they'd made plans with, and if he'd instead asked 'if we work around your schedule, would you be willing to do this?' he might have had a very different conversation, and maybe they could have gone on the trip on another weekend (assuming she's comfortable with taking her dog on that long of a trip). Instead, now OP has an ex girlfriend, I hope.", "I think the only thing that would have stopped me from calling the cops would be sending them to OP's sister's house. It's not their fault they're related to an a-hole. \n\nBut if she had called the cops I absolutely wouldn't blame her either.", "Oh for sure, but she hasn\u2019t said the words/made it official. Some people just leave to cool off with space, I just hope that\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing here. What he did is unforgivable and shows what he\u2019s capable of in the future.", "Actually, I thought it was hilarious. Tone often isn't captured in Internet comments.", "That is a good point! That being said, I don't trust OP to be a reliable narrator and say if she said anything about the future of their relationship, if that makes sense? I think it might be more wishful thinking on OP's part that we don't know how she feels about the matter.", "Very true, but honestly I would\u2019ve blame her if she said absolutely nothing to him other than calling him an AH when she left. She may want to process and collect her thoughts before ending it. But who knows because OP is so blind to how horrible everything he did here was."]}
