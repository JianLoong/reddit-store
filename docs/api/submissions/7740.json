My brother was really excited and asked if our grandparents, our aunts and cousins could be there and mom said it was just for her side and that our grandparents would probably do their own thing with him. He asked if our stepdad's ex-wife and her kids (two from before her time with our stepdad, and three came after) would be there and she said of course, because they're family and they're our stepsiblings bio siblings. He said that wasn't fair because they aren't his family and why are we trying to include them. My mom said they are family and we all want to get along and make sure everyone is treated just like family should. My stepdad said it would mean a lot to his kids, our stepsiblings, who are 10 and 8. My brother said if his family couldn't be there than the stepsiblings didn't get to have THEIR family at his birthday party. I said I agreed and I told them I wouldn't want them at mine either because they are not family to us. Our stepsiblings were there and got upset and asked why their mom and siblings couldn't be there. Our mom and stepdad assured them they would be there. My brother said it wasn't fair and said he didn't want them there and didn't give a shit about them. Mom was furious and yelled at them and I told her she couldn't expect him to want them there or to have strangers there just for our stepsiblings when she literally just said we couldn't have our family there because it was just for her side.\n\nMom was angry at me, told me I'm the oldest and should be responsible and not encourage him. She said blended families should be about inclusion and welcoming everyone in. I told her that she was going against what she said by excluding our dad's family. She told me that's different because they are no longer anything to do with her. I told her that didn't mean they weren't something to do with us and that dad's death did not erase the loving grandparents and aunts we had on his side. She told me I was being unfair and should not have agreed in front of my stepsiblings because now they're upset and don't understand why we don't like their family.\n\nAITA?\n\nThe people my brother does not want at his party are not our stepsiblings. But their mom and their siblings from their mom. They are not related to us. It's their dad who is married to our mom and his ex wife and her other children with different men are nothing to do with my brother.", "created_utc": 1674138166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g2xog/aita_for_backing_up_my_brother_in_saying_our/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like there is a blended family due to death, not abuse or neglect or anything, so it seems weird for her to exclude half your family.", "NTA. She is just upset that you used her logic against her. The birthday should be about the child, not about the adults. Sad that the adults cannot be civil to each other for an evening.", "NTA , ur mother is a major asshole tho , i literally thought ur parents were divorced and there were bad blood between them , but that would still no excuse not inviting ur family without a valid reason.\n\nJust cuz her late husband isn't alive dose not mean ur family aren't related to u or her , and honestly it doesn't make any sense for her to exclude them. Unless ur step father had put that in her brain , i cant even imagine why she would do that", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right, and it's good you stood up for your brother.\n\nThe wrong thing here is that your mother is limiting this to \"her side\" of the family, completely excluding your deceased father's side. She isn't even considering inviting your grandparents, aunts, cousins etc, despite the fact that you and your brother love them and would like them to be there. Let's keep in mind that the party is supposed to be for *your brother*. \n\nThe other weird thing is for your mother to be so fond of her husband's ex's children, who aren't even his children. I hope I didn't get this wrong:\n- your stepdad has some kids from a previous marriage (your stepsiblings)\n- your stepdad's ex got remarried and had additional children - those children have an active father in their life, right? \nWhy is your mother so desperate to include some other family's children??! Why does she want to include the ex-wife of her husband to her child's 14th anniversary? That's far-fetched. \n\nShe needs to decide if the party is small, just a few close family members, or if this is a huge party with just about everyone, in which case your father's side should also be invited.", "NTA.\nThat's the strangest thing I've seen on reddit today.\n\nI'm sorry they're so weird.", "NTA. I understand your mother\u2019s rationale with wanting to include step-siblings\u2019 bio siblings, but they went about it wrong. You\u2019re right to want your side of the family over if your step-siblings can have theirs over. This is more true on a big birthday celebration.", "NTA\n\nYeah sorry your mum is being incredibly hypocritical here. If it was a case of the grandparents can only come if the others were invited, sure. But your brother is going to want his grandparents at his party and excluding them just seems so so weird", "NTA. You and your brother are absolutely right! It\u2019s his day! And HIS family should be there. You hit the nail on the head when you called out your mom that if the step-kids get to have THEIR family, then you guys should have too. It\u2019s not a family event. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s birthday being celebrated after years. Blended family does stand for inclusiveness, but you didn\u2019t choose it. And your mom is absolutely being a hypocrite in this matter. Good for you for having your brother\u2019s back and standing up for up. Proud of you OP!", "NTA. Why is your stepsiblings family, who's not even blood related to you or your stepdad, just your stepsiblings, invited but your biological family is not? It's your brother's birthday party, not your stepsiblings. How are people who aren't even related to your stepdad, and through him your mom, considered family but your dad's family is not?

Your mum is being a hypocrite and your mum and step dad are raising the 8 and 10 year old to be very self centred if they are bothered that you don't want to invite their half siblings of no blood or marriage relation to you. \n\nTo me that's like inviting my cousin's cousin on the side not related to me. I don't know my cousin's cousin lol why would they be there.", "NTA - And you mother is a big ole\u2019 hypocrite!", "Oh wow. \n\nAt the start of the post I assumed your parents were divorced, not that your dad had passed. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. \n\nYour mother is being cruel and unreasonable. There\u2019s no reason why *your* grandparents shouldn\u2019t be able to attend while your step father\u2019s ex does. \n\nI would absolutely die on this hill if I were in your position. \n\nThis is just cruelty. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt really sounds like your mom wants a party and is using your brother's birthday. She is hijacking his birthday.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA but can you clarify the family relations for me? \nSo if I read this right. Your dad passed away and your mom remarried. Your mom is not inviting your dads side of the family (grandparents, aunts etc) but is inviting your Stepdads side of the family which includes Stepdads ex wife (oddly surprised your mom is okay with the ex wife being there but not her dead husbands side) and several children that are not your bio siblings or step siblings but are in fact your step siblings, bio siblings? That about get it right? Yeah NTA it\u2019s your brothers party and he should be allowed to invite the family he wants to see there not the family your mother wants to see there.", "NTA", "NTA your mother is making this party about her.\n\nIncluding your stepsiblings is perfectly fair but their extended family from their other side is excessive, especially when you've been told you can't have your own Dad's family at the party.\n\nIt sounds like for whatever reason your mother didn't get along with her first set of in laws, but it's not okay that she's content with you being kept from them if you want to still know them.", "NTA.  She\u2019s inviting people that your step siblings and Stepfather would want to be there, and not who your brother wants to be there.  I would encourage your brother to simply say \u201cI don\u2019t want a birthday party if it\u2019s not going to be for me.\u201d", "Nta. If I were your brother, I wouldn't even show up. It's not a party for him, it's for your mom.", "NTA if she insists on them coming I'd go out of my way to show my displeasure loudly at the party.", "NTA. You are absolutely right.", "Woah woah woah!!!!!\n\nSo your mum doesn't want your dad's family at the birthday party because they no longer have anything to do with her but she wants to have her husband's ex-wife and her other children there that are not related to her son or her!? Wow your mum is delusional.\n\nMaybe just send her the link for this thread. \n\nIt would make way more sense to invite your dad's family so you guys can have your big united family because at the end of the day, your step-fathers ex-wife and her kids will never be your family. Your mum's reasoning is flawed.", "NTA. You are right to point out your mom\u2019s hypocrisy.", "NTA.\n\nSo he\u2019s not allowed to have friends come to his own birthday party? They\u2019re not related to *anybody*. \n\nAt this point this isn\u2019t his birthday party, it\u2019s a party his mom wants to throw with him as an excuse. If I were him, I\u2019d ask if I were required to attend her party or if I could go have my own birthday party somewhere else while she\u2019s busy with hers.", "NTA. But Little brother should say do as you want. No longer my birthday party. Then spend the day with who he wants at a park. Everyone brings food. Might not be fancy but it will make it his party.", "NTA.  Stand your ground with mom, if dad's family doesn't come, neither do you.", "Nta she is being ridiculous forcing everyone she wants but not considering her children's feelings. However some families have a difficult time like grandparents and aunts and uncles seeing their family around someone else even years after their family passing. There could've been issues she had with them comments made about your stepdad that she never told you. Maybe she's just worried there will be fights or awkward issues inviting them with your stepdad family too. But your step siblings are your family now and for your sake I hope you and your brother start to grow bonds with them", "I had a similar argument with my mother for ages, she didn't consider my half-sister as part of her family. She may not be YOUR family, but she sure is mine. So, in that regard, your mom is definitely the AH and you're NTA.\n\nHowever, i do believe your brother saying \"i don't give a shit about them\" with your little stepbrothers there was a bit harsh (imagine you're 8 and your older brother says \"i don't give a shit about people you love\") and you should both talk to THEM about it. Tell them you care about them and that your anger is with your mother, not them.", "I mean, you're obviously quite young, but I think your last paragraph summed it up perfectly and was a great take. It really isn't fair on your brother to have to include your stepsiblings if he can't include his loved ones from your dad's side of the family. In this scenario, it's your mum being selfish. \n\nThat being said, that doesn't really absolve your brother from not wanting to include your step family.\nSeparate the 2 scenarios - \n\n1. Your paternal side not being invited. \n2. Your step siblings not being invited.\n\nThese events are mutually exclusive, in other words, they don't rely on each other. You don't need your paternal side to be there to have your step siblings there too.\n\nSo whilst you were mostly right in agreeing with your step brother, it seems clear that he was being unwelcoming to your stepfamily out of malice. If your grandparents were invited, he would probably be fine having stepsiblings there too. He's essentially taking out his anger on them and that's not fair. Sure it's his party and he deserves to have the grandparents there but whether you like it or not, your families are now one and you should treat stepsiblings like family. Divorce is a hard thing on children, try and make your lives easier for each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
