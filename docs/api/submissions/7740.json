My brother was really excited and asked if our grandparents, our aunts and cousins could be there and mom said it was just for her side and that our grandparents would probably do their own thing with him. He asked if our stepdad's ex-wife and her kids (two from before her time with our stepdad, and three came after) would be there and she said of course, because they're family and they're our stepsiblings bio siblings. He said that wasn't fair because they aren't his family and why are we trying to include them. My mom said they are family and we all want to get along and make sure everyone is treated just like family should. My stepdad said it would mean a lot to his kids, our stepsiblings, who are 10 and 8. My brother said if his family couldn't be there than the stepsiblings didn't get to have THEIR family at his birthday party. I said I agreed and I told them I wouldn't want them at mine either because they are not family to us. Our stepsiblings were there and got upset and asked why their mom and siblings couldn't be there. Our mom and stepdad assured them they would be there. My brother said it wasn't fair and said he didn't want them there and didn't give a shit about them. Mom was furious and yelled at them and I told her she couldn't expect him to want them there or to have strangers there just for our stepsiblings when she literally just said we couldn't have our family there because it was just for her side.\n\nMom was angry at me, told me I'm the oldest and should be responsible and not encourage him. She said blended families should be about inclusion and welcoming everyone in. I told her that she was going against what she said by excluding our dad's family. She told me that's different because they are no longer anything to do with her. I told her that didn't mean they weren't something to do with us and that dad's death did not erase the loving grandparents and aunts we had on his side. She told me I was being unfair and should not have agreed in front of my stepsiblings because now they're upset and don't understand why we don't like their family.\n\nAITA?\n\nThe people my brother does not want at his party are not our stepsiblings. But their mom and their siblings from their mom. They are not related to us. It's their dad who is married to our mom and his ex wife and her other children with different men are nothing to do with my brother.", "created_utc": 1674138166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g2xog/aita_for_backing_up_my_brother_in_saying_our/", "score": 1729, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like there is a blended family due to death, not abuse or neglect or anything, so it seems weird for her to exclude half your family.", "NTA. She is just upset that you used her logic against her. The birthday should be about the child, not about the adults. Sad that the adults cannot be civil to each other for an evening.", "NTA , ur mother is a major asshole tho , i literally thought ur parents were divorced and there were bad blood between them , but that would still no excuse not inviting ur family without a valid reason.\n\nJust cuz her late husband isn't alive dose not mean ur family aren't related to u or her , and honestly it doesn't make any sense for her to exclude them. Unless ur step father had put that in her brain , i cant even imagine why she would do that", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right, and it's good you stood up for your brother.\n\nThe wrong thing here is that your mother is limiting this to \"her side\" of the family, completely excluding your deceased father's side. She isn't even considering inviting your grandparents, aunts, cousins etc, despite the fact that you and your brother love them and would like them to be there. Let's keep in mind that the party is supposed to be for *your brother*. \n\nThe other weird thing is for your mother to be so fond of her husband's ex's children, who aren't even his children. I hope I didn't get this wrong:\n- your stepdad has some kids from a previous marriage (your stepsiblings)\n- your stepdad's ex got remarried and had additional children - those children have an active father in their life, right? \nWhy is your mother so desperate to include some other family's children??! Why does she want to include the ex-wife of her husband to her child's 14th anniversary? That's far-fetched. \n\nShe needs to decide if the party is small, just a few close family members, or if this is a huge party with just about everyone, in which case your father's side should also be invited.", "NTA.\nThat's the strangest thing I've seen on reddit today.\n\nI'm sorry they're so weird.", "NTA. I understand your mother\u2019s rationale with wanting to include step-siblings\u2019 bio siblings, but they went about it wrong. You\u2019re right to want your side of the family over if your step-siblings can have theirs over. This is more true on a big birthday celebration.", "NTA\n\nYeah sorry your mum is being incredibly hypocritical here. If it was a case of the grandparents can only come if the others were invited, sure. But your brother is going to want his grandparents at his party and excluding them just seems so so weird", "NTA. You and your brother are absolutely right! It\u2019s his day! And HIS family should be there. You hit the nail on the head when you called out your mom that if the step-kids get to have THEIR family, then you guys should have too. It\u2019s not a family event. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s birthday being celebrated after years. Blended family does stand for inclusiveness, but you didn\u2019t choose it. And your mom is absolutely being a hypocrite in this matter. Good for you for having your brother\u2019s back and standing up for up. Proud of you OP!", "NTA. Why is your stepsiblings family, who's not even blood related to you or your stepdad, just your stepsiblings, invited but your biological family is not? It's your brother's birthday party, not your stepsiblings. How are people who aren't even related to your stepdad, and through him your mom, considered family but your dad's family is not?

Your mum is being a hypocrite and your mum and step dad are raising the 8 and 10 year old to be very self centred if they are bothered that you don't want to invite their half siblings of no blood or marriage relation to you. \n\nTo me that's like inviting my cousin's cousin on the side not related to me. I don't know my cousin's cousin lol why would they be there.", "NTA - And you mother is a big ole\u2019 hypocrite!", "Oh wow. \n\nAt the start of the post I assumed your parents were divorced, not that your dad had passed. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. \n\nYour mother is being cruel and unreasonable. There\u2019s no reason why *your* grandparents shouldn\u2019t be able to attend while your step father\u2019s ex does. \n\nI would absolutely die on this hill if I were in your position. \n\nThis is just cruelty. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt really sounds like your mom wants a party and is using your brother's birthday. She is hijacking his birthday.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA but can you clarify the family relations for me? \nSo if I read this right. Your dad passed away and your mom remarried. Your mom is not inviting your dads side of the family (grandparents, aunts etc) but is inviting your Stepdads side of the family which includes Stepdads ex wife (oddly surprised your mom is okay with the ex wife being there but not her dead husbands side) and several children that are not your bio siblings or step siblings but are in fact your step siblings, bio siblings? That about get it right? Yeah NTA it\u2019s your brothers party and he should be allowed to invite the family he wants to see there not the family your mother wants to see there.", "NTA", "NTA your mother is making this party about her.\n\nIncluding your stepsiblings is perfectly fair but their extended family from their other side is excessive, especially when you've been told you can't have your own Dad's family at the party.\n\nIt sounds like for whatever reason your mother didn't get along with her first set of in laws, but it's not okay that she's content with you being kept from them if you want to still know them.", "NTA.  She\u2019s inviting people that your step siblings and Stepfather would want to be there, and not who your brother wants to be there.  I would encourage your brother to simply say \u201cI don\u2019t want a birthday party if it\u2019s not going to be for me.\u201d", "Nta. If I were your brother, I wouldn't even show up. It's not a party for him, it's for your mom.", "NTA if she insists on them coming I'd go out of my way to show my displeasure loudly at the party.", "NTA. You are absolutely right.", "Woah woah woah!!!!!\n\nSo your mum doesn't want your dad's family at the birthday party because they no longer have anything to do with her but she wants to have her husband's ex-wife and her other children there that are not related to her son or her!? Wow your mum is delusional.\n\nMaybe just send her the link for this thread. \n\nIt would make way more sense to invite your dad's family so you guys can have your big united family because at the end of the day, your step-fathers ex-wife and her kids will never be your family. Your mum's reasoning is flawed.", "NTA. You are right to point out your mom\u2019s hypocrisy.", "NTA.\n\nSo he\u2019s not allowed to have friends come to his own birthday party? They\u2019re not related to *anybody*. \n\nAt this point this isn\u2019t his birthday party, it\u2019s a party his mom wants to throw with him as an excuse. If I were him, I\u2019d ask if I were required to attend her party or if I could go have my own birthday party somewhere else while she\u2019s busy with hers.", "NTA. But Little brother should say do as you want. No longer my birthday party. Then spend the day with who he wants at a park. Everyone brings food. Might not be fancy but it will make it his party.", "NTA.  Stand your ground with mom, if dad's family doesn't come, neither do you.", "Nta she is being ridiculous forcing everyone she wants but not considering her children's feelings. However some families have a difficult time like grandparents and aunts and uncles seeing their family around someone else even years after their family passing. There could've been issues she had with them comments made about your stepdad that she never told you. Maybe she's just worried there will be fights or awkward issues inviting them with your stepdad family too. But your step siblings are your family now and for your sake I hope you and your brother start to grow bonds with them", "I had a similar argument with my mother for ages, she didn't consider my half-sister as part of her family. She may not be YOUR family, but she sure is mine. So, in that regard, your mom is definitely the AH and you're NTA.\n\nHowever, i do believe your brother saying \"i don't give a shit about them\" with your little stepbrothers there was a bit harsh (imagine you're 8 and your older brother says \"i don't give a shit about people you love\") and you should both talk to THEM about it. Tell them you care about them and that your anger is with your mother, not them.", "I mean, you're obviously quite young, but I think your last paragraph summed it up perfectly and was a great take. It really isn't fair on your brother to have to include your stepsiblings if he can't include his loved ones from your dad's side of the family. In this scenario, it's your mum being selfish. \n\nThat being said, that doesn't really absolve your brother from not wanting to include your step family.\nSeparate the 2 scenarios - \n\n1. Your paternal side not being invited. \n2. Your step siblings not being invited.\n\nThese events are mutually exclusive, in other words, they don't rely on each other. You don't need your paternal side to be there to have your step siblings there too.\n\nSo whilst you were mostly right in agreeing with your step brother, it seems clear that he was being unwelcoming to your stepfamily out of malice. If your grandparents were invited, he would probably be fine having stepsiblings there too. He's essentially taking out his anger on them and that's not fair. Sure it's his party and he deserves to have the grandparents there but whether you like it or not, your families are now one and you should treat stepsiblings like family. Divorce is a hard thing on children, try and make your lives easier for each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP and OPs brother object to this as their mothers \"blended family\" argument seems to be being used to justify the presence of people that OP and his brother have no relationship with but being disregarded in order to exclude their fathers family who they love and want to see. \n\nBased on this I can see a few interpretations \n\n1. Having her late husbands family around is painful for OPs mother so she avoids it and is trying to move on\n\n2. There is more to the dynamic between OPs mother and late fathers side of the family than OP is aware of\n\n3. The stepdad, behind closed doors, feels threatened by continued involvement of his wifes late husbands family in their lives and is against it \n\nIn all three of these scenarios OP and his little brother are being severely let down. They are either being distanced from their dads family by their mother based on her feelings. Or they are being kept in the dark about the relationship ultimately causing hurt and confusion on their side. Or stepdad is driving a wedge between them and their dads family and mum is allowing it. \n\nAny way I look at this OPs mother is letting them down. This whole scenario just has me sad for OP and his brother caught in a situation where all they want is that feeling of connection to their dads family.", "NTA you \u2018mom\u2019 is being both a hypocrite and a shit parent.", "1.\tIf mom wants to throw a random party for her husband\u2019s extended family, she shouldn\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a birthday party for her son. \n\n2.\t Mom is the one who decided to discuss the guest list in front of others.

Her husband dies, and probably feels like showing interest in his family still shows poorly towards her new husband/family. My recommendation, work towards not being dependent on her for ANYTHING, get out of the house and if you have children limit her interactions. Let her know since your father's blood is running through your child's veins you just assumed she wanted everything from his line cut out from her life. I'm sorry you have such a crappy mother.", "ESH\nYour mom appears to be continuing the practice of separate family parties/holidays with your grandparents.  If they cannot be civil with your mom for the length of a party after the passing of their son, then I get it. Some people can't emotionally handle their dead child's living spouse remarrying. It can get ugly, and it is easier for your mom to shield her kids from that than to handle your and your brother's distress from fighting in front of you, especially if she does want to protect your relationship with them.\n\nAttacking the step siblings in retaliation for not getting the combined party your brother and you wanted is also unkind.\n\nBut this really sounds like there was a big falling out between your mom and her former in-laws.  If she's unwilling to host them, will not talk to them, and returns gifts they try to send?  Then expecting her to have them at a party she is organizing and paying for is a huge ask.  They will interpret that as forgiveness/reconciliation, and it does not sound like she wants that at all.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like the party is for her and her family, not him and his family.

And if she won't explain she should expect this fight over and over until she does.\n\nPlease understand that your grandparents can love you and still not like your mom. And that you may never see it.

It is fair only to have everyone's family or no one's family at the event. She doesn't get to be hypocritical. \n\nYou should probably try to negotiate calmly with her and also maybe make the step siblings feel that its not them you are mad/upset with but rather the way your mom created the situation.", "NTA I completely understand why you backed up your brother.\nIs your brother even able to invite some of his friends to HIS party?\n\nI'd be pissed if my mom hyped me up for a big birthday party then decided to tell me that she invited my step dads ex wife and her 3 young children because they're \"family\" but my grandparents, aunts, and cousins from my deceased dad's family weren't invited.", "If it were my party I'd tell my mom to invite whoever she wanted, i wouldn't be there.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

That\u2019s like 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon weird. Or in the south, a regular family. Lol. So the mom doesn\u2019t want to invite biologically related people that are close to her son to her son\u2019s birthday but wants to invite people who aren\u2019t? But says she wants to keep it close family? WTF! Might as well invite the ex wife\u2019s new husband\u2019s grandma.

That sucks, especially being so young.  I may be wrong, but when a spouse passes, the reason for them not being together isn't anything someone has done. It's not an ex, no divorce. There was still love there. It got cut short. This can cause some insecurities in new spouses, like your step dad.

You may not either, because these are adult issues. \nThat being said, it is your brother's birthday, and it should be his guest list mostly. And while I can see maybe leaving your dad's side to do their own thing with you guys as one issue, like a boundary your mom and step dad have, not great, but I can understand it. I do not think it is ok to have to have your step siblings, half siblings, and their mother at your brothers party. They are not a part of his life, and it is not the step siblings' party. It is his party. You were right to stick up for him. Blended families take work and have to happen organically.

That's just weird that she's insisting on including them but refusing to include her deceased husband's family who you guys know and love.  Your a good brother for sticking up for your sibling.  Hopefully it all works out and your brother can have all the people he loves there to celebrate him.", "NTA, I am a step parent myself. I wouldn't be comfortable if my partner and I had a bio child and my step daughter (5) was made to bring her mum and all her siblings along with her to the kids celebrations. (I'm sure she wouldn't be comfortable with it either). \n\nPersonally due to it being your brother's birthday I wouldn't find it appropriate. \n\nThere are times my SD has asked if we can have sleep overs at her mums and vice versa. We have all usually said unfortunately no as we have to go back to our own homes.  I'm not comfortable with staying at my partners ex's place nor having her stay with us. My partner understands and respects this. If my step daughter wants us all to hang out we usually will take her out somewhere together. Mind you the four of us (both step parents and bio parents) are good friends. We just have our own personal boundaries. \n\nHowever your step siblings family on their mums side aren't generally yours or your brothers family. They don't have to come along to every celebration and event your brother has. And it is about your brother. If your brother doesn't want them there (the step siblings mum and other siblings) then they don't have to be.\n\nAlso blended families don't usually include the ex's and their families too. That isn't always the case though because it does depend on each situation.

It makes perfect sense to me that she and your SF would want to have all the siblings together, half, step and bio. I think you both reacted without thinking of how it would make other's feel and that can create some real problems. \n\nPersonally I think you just pretty much messed up what was supposed to be a happy and fun occasion.
