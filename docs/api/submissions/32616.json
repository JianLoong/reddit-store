While living with MIL I paid \u00a3500 a month rent, food and utilities. We are a family for 4 we had one room for all of us. When we were moving out MIL told my husband she didn\u2019t know what she was going to do without the extra money. I told MIL I\u2019d pay her \u00a3150 a month for her to help with the kids and for her took cook for us. (We\u2019re a blended family. My daughter is with me 3 nights a week same with stepdaughter.) after we move out I change jobs and get paid better so I started giving MIL \u00a3200. MIL stops helping with the kids. I keep paying \u00a3200. MIL refuses to cook for my daughter. I still pay her \u00a3200. Last month I told MIL I could only pay her \u00a3150 as work had slowed down MIL was really unhappy about this. My hours at work changed and iv asked MIL not to cook for me as my break is 2-6pm and MIL likes to have tea at 6. I told her this morning I\u2019m only giving her \u00a3100 this month as I\u2019m buying more food for me and my daughter.
