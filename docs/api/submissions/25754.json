What you describe occurs only in the more affluent circles and is usually a need for a few months in which single mom can pay back child rather quickly. \n\nI stick with what I said. There is NO instance where TAKING money from a child is okay. I intentionally didn\u2019t say the word \u201cborrow\u201d. \n\nIf a parent were to borrow from their kid, I would hope that they would pay kid back first (as the other commenter wrote on this thread) and potentially with a reasonable interest. The lesson the kid would learn about the transaction would be invaluable in preventing said kid from being taken advantage of later in life.\n\n\n\nEdited to add: I apologize for the rant. Your comment set me off, because I\u2019m so dang tired of going to bat for these kids whose parents just keep TAKING. One of my students just this past Friday sent home his \u201ctuition refund\u201d after enrolling in his first semester college classes, and I really went ballistic with my team. It PAINS me that this kid just LOANED $3000 and wired it 300 miles away for his family to have. He doesn\u2019t understand that he just put himself 3K in debt for them.
