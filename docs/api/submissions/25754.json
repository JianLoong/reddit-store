Thankfully, they now know that thanks to you. \n\nFinally, ask your grandparents for money for shoes.", "NTA, you're a badass for making that facebook post and I'm glad your grandparents have your back. People like your parents like to put on happy smiles for the outside world and their worst nightmare is being exposed for the rotten human beings they are.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty confident that **babies don't decide to be born.** \n\nIf your parents didn't want to raise a child, they should have given you to a family who actually wanted you. They were the only ones who made the mistake, and it's their problem, not yours.", "Your parents are abusive. They decided to have you and they have the obligation to take care of you.

I do wish this long post wasn\u2019t one very long run on sentence.", "NTA - As someone who can relate with your situation, Your parents are greedy mfs who are gaslighting you so you will feel bad and give them all your money. I know you're only 15 but you should really consider leaving, Is there a family member you can go with? Otherwise my advice would be to save as much cash as you can for 3-years, Whether its in a shoebox or bank account etc. just get money saved-up so you can leave at 18.\n\nYou did the right thing exposing them to the rest of the family, Now they will have no choice whether its to give you your money back or become better parents (doubtful tho).", "NTA. Your parents acted unfairly by taking your money and using hurtful language. You were trying to stand up for yourself and address their behavior. It's natural to seek support from family when faced with such a situation. Your parents' actions caused the fallout, not your response.", "NTA. You are the child and your parents are the adults.

You are not a bad daughter. They are shyster parents and you deserve repayment down to the penny. You were being generous because you thought they needed help. They took advantage of your kindness to live it up. That is NOT ok.", "NTA. If your parents thought what they were doing was okay, they should have had no problem with you sharing the info with your family. They now know that what they did was shameful, that's on them.

She said truthful statements about what her parents have done. If they didn't want everyone finding out what they did, they shouldn't have done it.", "What does being young have to do with anything. If she was 35 and her parents did the same thing involving birthday cash, at least she\u2019d be old enough to say no. It\u2019s worse her parents did this while she was young! The power dynamic of a child and their parents is huge! She likely had very little recourse to get her money back. But what her parents did was financial abuse. She should not have to ask for money that is already hers. Replace parents with husband, and I think you\u2019d be singing a different tune. Now, if her parents decided, they wanted to put her money away and save it for her, that\u2019s a different story. But that\u2019s not what her parents did. They asked her for cash spent it and then refused to pay it back. The National Domestic Violence Hotline describes says financial abuse can take the form of \u201cYour partner takes any money earned from you and controls where you spend it.\u201d That\u2019s what they did! Her parents were not thinking about their daughter. They were only thinking about themselves. I\u2019m glad her grandparents stepped up to parent their own adult children. It\u2019s sad it got that far.
