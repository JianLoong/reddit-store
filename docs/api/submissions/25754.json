If she was 35 and her parents did the same thing involving birthday cash, at least she\u2019d be old enough to say no. It\u2019s worse her parents did this while she was young! The power dynamic of a child and their parents is huge! She likely had very little recourse to get her money back. But what her parents did was financial abuse. She should not have to ask for money that is already hers. Replace parents with husband, and I think you\u2019d be singing a different tune. Now, if her parents decided, they wanted to put her money away and save it for her, that\u2019s a different story. But that\u2019s not what her parents did. They asked her for cash spent it and then refused to pay it back. The National Domestic Violence Hotline describes says financial abuse can take the form of \u201cYour partner takes any money earned from you and controls where you spend it.\u201d That\u2019s what they did!

It happens. Our parents had to borrow money from us once when we were (working) teenagers. But they paid it back promptly.", "I disagree. If someone gave that child money for their most recent birthday, similar to this timing, that was done knowing the situation and that the kid was going without because their parents can\u2019t fully cover everything.
