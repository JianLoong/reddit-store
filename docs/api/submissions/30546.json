From the description you describe a purely social event- did you leave something out?", "NTA. Figuring out the tab takes communication. I'm not sure how you were expected to figure out the split of the bill without asking.", "NTA. That\u2019s very common in my industry for the people eligible to use their per diem towards the bill and others to give a nice tip.\n\nIf a boss is there they expense the whole bill as \u201cteam building\u201d", "YTA. You accompanied your wife to her job related dinner with her co-workers. It would have been better to let them sort things out themselves. The same goes for the correction \u2013 was it really necessary? Unless you're all very familiar with each other, the correction could have been awkward.", "NTA - why is your wife expecting you to socialise and pay for dinner with visiting colleagues if her company doesn\u2019t even care enough to cover the bill.\n\nSeems your wife embarrassed herself by acting like a big shot inviting all the visiting colleagues to dinner assuming you would just pay for it.", "NTA, but if YOUR WIFE invited them, she should have assumed that she/ya'll would be paying (unless it was a mutually agreed upon dinner).", "sounds a bit like ESH\n\nsince you should have clarified with your wifer beforehand who was going to be covering the bill or how.\n\ni go on work trips also and the company usually does pay for my meals while travelling out (away from home) although where i am (in australia) 50 miles does not count as away from home USUALLY, as well we could drive home. So there can be exceptions but that would have been made clear.\n\nif your wife was a manager with the ability/facility to authorise company paid dinners that would be different as this could be assumed a possibility but again should have been clarified before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She also complained that I had corrected her when she said a Midwestern state only had one state college. Ugh I feel like I can't say anything right \n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou quite possibly sounded all upity and proud of yourself for being a know it all when correcting her i presume", "YTA-I think the college thing is kinda minor, but why did you have to open your mouth about the bill and make assumptions while opening said mouth? Your wife coordinated this dinner. Butt out and let her handle it, or be diligent enough to ask her while in the car on the way over. \n\nWhen my extended family goes out to eat my husband and I always discuss whether we are offering to pay before arriving. We are a one check family and people generally just rotate. Having that discussion ahead of time prevents us from having the awkward glances with everyone at the table itself.", "Your wife invited them. Additionally, she's (I assume) senior to the grad student. Unless the other one was her boss, she **should** pay. Regardless, asking who is paying is very uncouth. Let them figure it out.\n\nSo yes, YTA.", "NTA. Your wife invited her colleagues, so she should pay for them. Or, if she expected you to pay (I assume she expected because nobody said anything about the bill until you asked if her job is paying), she should talk to you in advance about this and make sure you agree and don't mind to pay.", "Honestly with both comments I think it depends a lot on how they were said. \n\nIt seems like this wasn't an official work event, but something your wife invited them to so work would not pay, but asking isn't all that terrible, and your wife saying that made her uncomfortable isn't an asshole move either. \n\nThe comment correcting her could swing either way, it really depends on the context and the tone. \n\nI'll say NAH", "NTA.", ">She also complained that I had corrected her...\n\n\"Ugh\" is right.  Another one like my ex-wife.  If you don't have kids yet, GTFO **now**.  There is no \"things might get better\" with a partner like that.", "Did they assume you were going to pay their tab?\n\nLike these are her coworkers completely capable of paying their part or did she/they/somebody mention these two were going to cover their meals?\n\nEdit: NTA - it was a group work event that only 2 people came to.", "Why would the company pay for a dinner your wife invited her colleagues to? That's a bizarre assumption to make. It still doesn't make you an AH, but it's a bit random. Going with NAH", "NAH - kind of odd to assume her work would pay for it since it was not a work function. Doesnt make you an AH tho.", "YTA.\n\nYou embarrassed your wife twice. The correction about the college is a little thing but, trust me, people do not like to be corrected - especially when the correction isn't very relevant.\n\nThe more important thing here is that *your wife* invited her colleagues to dinner. Her office didn't ask her to do that, she did it of her own volition. And you made it seem like you were out for a free meal on her company's dime. \n\nFWIW, when you *invite* a person somewhere, you should pay their way.", "NAH. Often when multiple people from a company go to dinner and at least one of them is traveling, that person picks up dinner and expenses it. Not always but most of the time in my experience. So the question wasn't out of line. \n\nWithout details on the other comment, no way to know how it was said, what context and if it was an issue or not.", "I dont think you did anything wrong, but I think your wife might be the AH.\n\nYour wife organised a dinner for her work colleagues after a work conference. Only 2 people came. I think your question was fair as you were not sure if her work wanted her to organise this dinner and were covering the meal cost. \n\nHowever, it seems your wife wanted a social dinner, so work would not cover this, but did the other colleagues know this wasn't covered by the company? Did your wife specifically tell these colleagues that she was covering the cost or everyone would cover their own meal?\n\nAlso, how did your comment about the bill make her uncomfortable? Was everyone just supposed to stare at the bill on the table indefinately? Was she wanting you to cover the cost of the whole bill? I don't get where your wife is coming from.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Why would work pay for your socializing?", "Yta", "NTA.  Some time had elapsed and the issue of the bill needed to be addressed.  It was a function for HER colleagues so she should have taken action as soon as the check was put on the table.  By this point it should have been clear who was paying for it anyway.  It seems like she was expecting you to pay without asking even though that hadn't been discussed.", "NAH\n\nDinner with co-workers is not a fun time, usually uncomfortable to begin with. She probably just wanted to look good in front of them. I don't think you said anything wrong from what you wrote but correcting someone in front of company is kinda meehhh.", "LAO", "She organized the dinner for some people who were visiting the area for a conference her office helped put together.", "Dude. OP said no one was taking the bill until he asked.", "Buy clearly the wife didn't communicate who was to pay or there would be no reason no ask. Also NO ONE grabbed the bil til he asked whose paying.", "The college thing isn't even minor, thats part of normal discussions. People find out new things or that they might have been incorrect. Being mad about that is insane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd \"why did you have to open your mouth about the bill and make assumptions while opening said mouth\". Reverse the roles and say that about the wife. HOLY SHIT that's a stupid thing to say. Nobody is reaching for the bill from the whole table. You say to butt out and let her handle it, but NOBODY WAS HANDLING IT.   \n\n\nAnd why does he have to be diligent to ask her about it when she is the one who apparently organized it? It's an honest question, so can you say how it is harmful or anything? Why should that make someone uncomfortable?", "wrong nta, an adult pays for their own meal unless told \"my shout\" by the other party. Otherwise if you can't afford to go out for a meal you don't go out for a meal.", "I would add: your wife might have low self-esteem because she is making issue from innocent correction about state college ( I would thank and forget) and blame you for asking about the bill.", "If it was a company meal, then it should be company who pays for it. If it was just a nice meal between colleagues, then you should pay for yourselves. The fact that Op was invited, means that it\u2019s more than likely a nice meal between colleagues.", "I was thinking this exactly. It all depends a lot on quite a few things, mostly tone both ways. Won\u2019t lie, this is one of the more boring AITAs haha", "That\u2019s the only thing I think OP was an AH about. Why would you embarrass your partner in public, in front of coworkers? Sounds like maybe you were the poor spouse if you\u2019re complaining about that\u2026..", "It seems so as he said no one went for the bill until he brought it up. All the ytas are nuts.", "Um its standard its a work dinner\u2026. \n\nOtherwise why would her colleagues be sat there pretending the bill doesn\u2019t exist? They expect a colleague to buy them dinner since they\u2019re in the area for work ?", "My company pays for happy hour every week with employees.", "My company pays for events when we have out of town colleagues, it\u2019s part of team building expenses", "That happens all the time.", "I caught it as a question.  Something to break the ice with when nobody said or did anything when the bill arrived.  I can get how this can be awkward and anything that breaks the ice is welcomed.  Or is it just me that thinks this?", "Dude, he just didn't want to pay for her coworkers. What's wrong with that?", "My job pays for my team dinners so we can drink wine with each other and socialize. Not an unreasonable question in any way.", "It's very common for businesses to pay for a meal when a colleague visits or even just a \"team building\" dinner. Spouses may be included.", "very common.. every country office I visit we will have dinner on companies dime", "\"So, who is gonna pay for this?\" is terribly cringy bordering on rude. Even if it's not those exact words.", "So \"oh actually there's two state colleges for XYZ state.\"\n\nThat's meehh? Nah wtf that's conversation.", "Some people? In the story you told there were only two colleagues and one was local. Which is it?", "Given \"my shout\", I'm just going to assume we run in different circles.\n\nAs an adult, if I ask a work colleague to dinner and I'm senior to them, I pay or the company does. If it's a group of friends, of course it's different but this is not that.", "Low self esteem and maybe not a lot of experience with work-related dinners. Perfectly fine to ask if the meal is hosted/no-host. Companies often have their own unique rules on hosting.", "Sometimes it's nice to see a relatively wholesome, boring problem where someone is just concerned that they upset their spouse though.  Like a palate cleanser after some of the wilder AITA posts", "Nope. Facts are facts. If I'm wrong, I don't give a shit if my partner \"corrects me\" in front of others. My ego isn't that fragile.", "OP has said it was a group thing where only 2 people showed up. \n\nGonna go with NTA because either\n\nA) Some office group outings do have a job pays bill or you pay what you order and it's not out of the question to ask\n\nOr \n\nB) They assumed OP's wife was paying when they didn't grab for the check.", "Maybe after a work event. Not just because coworkers want to hang out.", "He didn't ask who is going to pay for it. He asked if work was. The next obvious assumption if it isn't covered by work is probably that its being split. What a reach.  \n\n\nIf nobody is reaching for the bill should everyone just sit there in silence until one person volunteers to pay the tab, since it would be rude to ask/confirm that its being split then? It's called communication.", "More we're invited but only the two showed up.", "Yea but OP stated no one went for the bill, including his wife until he asked.", "Haha that\u2019s a completely fair assessment", "Yeah, being insensitive and inconsiderate will lead to being alone\u2026.", "During my 30+ years in business my various jobs paid for many social events. I don't know what kind of company OP works for, and free dinners might not be as popular as they used to be. But it is absolutely a very real practice.", "Not a very good work function, is it?", "Personally I don\u2019t know anyone who immediately reaches for the bill when it gets to the table, unless the bill was specifically requested to be brought over at that time. Usually people are still talking, nibbling the last bites of food, finishing up drinks and conversations. \n\nUnless the check was sitting there being ignored for awhile (say 5-10 minutes or longer), and everyone was just sitting there staring at one another, OP was very much jumping the gun on the situation.", "It's a fair question.  Dinner that the colleagues were all invited to after a conference would normally be paid for by a business."]}
