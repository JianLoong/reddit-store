You accompanied your wife to her job related dinner with her co-workers. It would have been better to let them sort things out themselves. The same goes for the correction \u2013 was it really necessary? Unless you're all very familiar with each other, the correction could have been awkward.", "NTA - why is your wife expecting you to socialise and pay for dinner with visiting colleagues if her company doesn\u2019t even care enough to cover the bill.\n\nSeems your wife embarrassed herself by acting like a big shot inviting all the visiting colleagues to dinner assuming you would just pay for it.", "NTA, but if YOUR WIFE invited them, she should have assumed that she/ya'll would be paying (unless it was a mutually agreed upon dinner).", "sounds a bit like ESH\n\nsince you should have clarified with your wifer beforehand who was going to be covering the bill or how.\n\ni go on work trips also and the company usually does pay for my meals while travelling out (away from home) although where i am (in australia) 50 miles does not count as away from home USUALLY, as well we could drive home. So there can be exceptions but that would have been made clear.\n\nif your wife was a manager with the ability/facility to authorise company paid dinners that would be different as this could be assumed a possibility but again should have been clarified before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She also complained that I had corrected her when she said a Midwestern state only had one state college.

Your wife coordinated this dinner. Butt out and let her handle it, or be diligent enough to ask her while in the car on the way over. \n\nWhen my extended family goes out to eat my husband and I always discuss whether we are offering to pay before arriving. We are a one check family and people generally just rotate. Having that discussion ahead of time prevents us from having the awkward glances with everyone at the table itself.", "Your wife invited them. Additionally, she's (I assume) senior to the grad student. Unless the other one was her boss, she **should** pay. Regardless, asking who is paying is very uncouth. Let them figure it out.\n\nSo yes, YTA.", "NTA. Your wife invited her colleagues, so she should pay for them. Or, if she expected you to pay (I assume she expected because nobody said anything about the bill until you asked if her job is paying), she should talk to you in advance about this and make sure you agree and don't mind to pay.", "Honestly with both comments I think it depends a lot on how they were said. \n\nIt seems like this wasn't an official work event, but something your wife invited them to so work would not pay, but asking isn't all that terrible, and your wife saying that made her uncomfortable isn't an asshole move either. \n\nThe comment correcting her could swing either way, it really depends on the context and the tone. \n\nI'll say NAH", "NTA.", ">She also complained that I had corrected her...\n\n\"Ugh\" is right.

That's a bizarre assumption to make. It still doesn't make you an AH, but it's a bit random. Going with NAH", "NAH - kind of odd to assume her work would pay for it since it was not a work function. Doesnt make you an AH tho.", "YTA.\n\nYou embarrassed your wife twice. The correction about the college is a little thing but, trust me, people do not like to be corrected - especially when the correction isn't very relevant.\n\nThe more important thing here is that *your wife* invited her colleagues to dinner. Her office didn't ask her to do that, she did it of her own volition. And you made it seem like you were out for a free meal on her company's dime. \n\nFWIW, when you *invite* a person somewhere, you should pay their way.", "NAH. Often when multiple people from a company go to dinner and at least one of them is traveling, that person picks up dinner and expenses it. Not always but most of the time in my experience. So the question wasn't out of line. \n\nWithout details on the other comment, no way to know how it was said, what context and if it was an issue or not.", "I dont think you did anything wrong, but I think your wife might be the AH.\n\nYour wife organised a dinner for her work colleagues after a work conference. Only 2 people came. I think your question was fair as you were not sure if her work wanted her to organise this dinner and were covering the meal cost. \n\nHowever, it seems your wife wanted a social dinner, so work would not cover this, but did the other colleagues know this wasn't covered by the company? Did your wife specifically tell these colleagues that she was covering the cost or everyone would cover their own meal?\n\nAlso, how did your comment about the bill make her uncomfortable? Was everyone just supposed to stare at the bill on the table indefinately? Was she wanting you to cover the cost of the whole bill? I don't get where your wife is coming from.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Why would work pay for your socializing?", "Yta", "NTA.  Some time had elapsed and the issue of the bill needed to be addressed.  It was a function for HER colleagues so she should have taken action as soon as the check was put on the table.  By this point it should have been clear who was paying for it anyway.  It seems like she was expecting you to pay without asking even though that hadn't been discussed.", "NAH\n\nDinner with co-workers is not a fun time, usually uncomfortable to begin with. She probably just wanted to look good in front of them. I don't think you said anything wrong from what you wrote but correcting someone in front of company is kinda meehhh.", "LAO", "She organized the dinner for some people who were visiting the area for a conference her office helped put together.", "Dude. OP said no one was taking the bill until he asked.", "Buy clearly the wife didn't communicate who was to pay or there would be no reason no ask. Also NO ONE grabbed the bil til he asked whose paying.", "The college thing isn't even minor, thats part of normal discussions. People find out new things or that they might have been incorrect. Being mad about that is insane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd \"why did you have to open your mouth about the bill and make assumptions while opening said mouth\". Reverse the roles and say that about the wife. HOLY SHIT that's a stupid thing to say. Nobody is reaching for the bill from the whole table. You say to butt out and let her handle it, but NOBODY WAS HANDLING IT.   \n\n\nAnd why does he have to be diligent to ask her about it when she is the one who apparently organized it? It's an honest question, so can you say how it is harmful or anything? Why should that make someone uncomfortable?", "wrong nta, an adult pays for their own meal unless told \"my shout\" by the other party. Otherwise if you can't afford to go out for a meal you don't go out for a meal.", "I would add: your wife might have low self-esteem because she is making issue from innocent correction about state college ( I would thank and forget) and blame you for asking about the bill.", "If it was a company meal, then it should be company who pays for it. If it was just a nice meal between colleagues, then you should pay for yourselves. The fact that Op was invited, means that it\u2019s more than likely a nice meal between colleagues.", "I was thinking this exactly. It all depends a lot on quite a few things, mostly tone both ways. Won\u2019t lie, this is one of the more boring AITAs haha", "That\u2019s the only thing I think OP was an AH about. Why would you embarrass your partner in public, in front of coworkers? Sounds like maybe you were the poor spouse if you\u2019re complaining about that\u2026..", "It seems so as he said no one went for the bill until he brought it up. All the ytas are nuts.", "Um its standard its a work dinner\u2026. \n\nOtherwise why would her colleagues be sat there pretending the bill doesn\u2019t exist?

In the story you told there were only two colleagues and one was local. Which is it?", "Given \"my shout\", I'm just going to assume we run in different circles.\n\nAs an adult, if I ask a work colleague to dinner and I'm senior to them, I pay or the company does. If it's a group of friends, of course it's different but this is not that.", "Low self esteem and maybe not a lot of experience with work-related dinners. Perfectly fine to ask if the meal is hosted/no-host.

My ego isn't that fragile.", "OP has said it was a group thing where only 2 people showed up. \n\nGonna go with NTA because either\n\nA) Some office group outings do have a job pays bill or you pay what you order and it's not out of the question to ask\n\nOr \n\nB) They assumed OP's wife was paying when they didn't grab for the check.", "Maybe after a work event. Not just because coworkers want to hang out.", "He didn't ask who is going to pay for it. He asked if work was. The next obvious assumption if it isn't covered by work is probably that its being split. What a reach.  \n\n\nIf nobody is reaching for the bill should everyone just sit there in silence until one person volunteers to pay the tab, since it would be rude to ask/confirm that its being split then?

I don't know what kind of company OP works for, and free dinners might not be as popular as they used to be. But it is absolutely a very real practice.", "Not a very good work function, is it?", "Personally I don\u2019t know anyone who immediately reaches for the bill when it gets to the table, unless the bill was specifically requested to be brought over at that time. Usually people are still talking, nibbling the last bites of food, finishing up drinks and conversations. \n\nUnless the check was sitting there being ignored for awhile (say 5-10 minutes or longer), and everyone was just sitting there staring at one another, OP was very much jumping the gun on the situation.", "It's a fair question.  Dinner that the colleagues were all invited to after a conference would normally be paid for by a business.", "Being your wife's work colleagues and you being a tag along, I would've just shut up and let the work people worry about the paying. Whether your wife's working was picking up the tab or whether it was a social dinner that you were personally on the hook for should've been left for your wife and her work colleagues to worry about.\n\nI would've stayed right out of it and not risk coming across like an asshole by asking. Not that asking makes you an asshole, but I would've said nothing and not risk putting your wife in thw position of possibly wing the one with the Scrooge husband who worries about whether work is pay8ng for his dinner or  not.", "The problem with your question is, it's likely strongly against expenses policy to charge for anything that isn't 100% work related, up to and including your guests at dinner, even if your own meal is claimable. What classes as 'entertaining' is also often carefully controlled. Errant claims are simply not tax deductible and your company ends up paying for the full price of whatever you claim that wasn't a legitimate expense.\n\nAsking it out of the blue, when it obviously wouldn't be an expense (to anyone at the company, admittedly), your wife might be worried that her colleagues will get the impression that you often go out and expense your personal meals. Depending where you are in the world and the attitude of her colleagues, they might see this as outright stealing, or at least a big no-no that needs reporting.\n\nIf your wife works for a big enough corporation, it could cause a significant amount of unwanted attention, maybe even an investigation into her prior expenses etc.\n\nAnd if that sounds ridiculous, it's really not. There's many an example of people losing their jobs for expensing their partner's meals and other non-work-related things, when when they were legitimately travelling themselves.\n\nDon't fiddle expenses, and definitely don't make jokes (or innocent comments) about it in front of colleagues!", "NTA. If you have the ability to getting your or someone\u2019s company to pay for dinner or anything is something to take full advantage of. I\u2019m not saying abuse. It\u2019s literally there to use.", "NTA. This falls on your wife as she was the hostess.  You\u2019re not responsible for her feelings or lack of knowledge. Don\u2019t take on that burden.  Remember, you can\u2019t help stupid", "Sounds like a work dinner to me if of assumed my company would pay", "YTA for thinking her work would pay (you shouldn\u2019t expect to feed off the company dime when you clearly have no value to their business), but NTA for eventually splitting the bill and doing your part.", "NTA, but your wife is the one and only Ahole.\n\n1. If she was organizing this on behalf of her company, then she needed to have their agreement to pay for it.\n2. If the company wasn't going to pay for it, then it was up to her to make clear to everyone that this was informal and everyone was paying their own way.\n3. It's not clear from the post whether wife gave the others the impression she was paying for the meal. But she should have told the server at the start of the meal that it needed to be split by the different parties. Failing that, she should have been the first to say something when the bill arrived... something like, \"*I'm sorry I didn't ask the server to split the bill for us. I'll figure out our (hers and OP's) share and hand you the bill to figure out your own.*\"\n4. Regarding the college comment. If wife's statement was incorrect, and she's upset that you didn't allow her mistake to stand as truth... well, then it just fits a pattern here.\n5. Your wife needs to be right (maybe especially with work folks or just with others in general). Her mistakes are always someone else's (i.e., YOUR) fault. Maybe she has a moderate case of this. It's still not great, nor a great look on her. But you will be hard-pressed for her to see that in herself. Not sure how much success you can have addressing that with her, but - at least - you can rest assured that you are N-T-A in that regard, just married to someone who is a bit of one.", "NTA just a regular PITA", "So your wife expected you to pay for her work colleagues why would you she invited them not you. You paid half which is more than you had to do.", "NAH. There was nothing wrong with you asking that question. It seems she just wants to get mad at random things. It\u2019s also fairly standard for a company to pay for work dinners, so I can understand why you asked the question. It just seems that your wife wanted her own social function.", "NTA, Since she was the organizer of the function, people must assume the company is picking the cheque, hence the silence and non-movement, there is nothing wrong with asking the question,  \n\nYour wife's attitude is the most unpleasant, in what way was she not comfortable? I am not really getting the point, if anything she is the AH for not communicating with her co-workers and her hubby, she wants people to think and act the way she wants magically, mani hate woman like that", "NTA, you just made random comments after probably not thinking too hard, happens to everyone and it'll happen again, it's normal", "Nah always discuss the bill before ordering. Idk why would your wife feel that way unless she promised them you or her would pay. You said nothing wrong.", "you are dealing with.....a woman. you are always TA. but not really. hang in there mate!", "INFO I have no clue why anyone is mad or why you would ask if work would be paying", "YTA.\n\nIt's not a work function.  The purpose isn't work.  If someone offers to pay using a Corp card, that's on them, but asking someone to abuse company funds on behalf of your wife the employee is a terrible look.  Plus, you look cheap.\n\nSituation like that, just assume split bill.", "This is just weird.

In fact, this type of \u2018work social\u2019 is encouraged, because I\u2019m not in the same city as most of my colleagues, and an organic dinner with colleagues would never happen. Building relationships within teams/orgs is good for companies (usually), so money spent on a dinner would definitely be reimbursed.
