We have a loving, easy relationship. My gf is a vet tech and we have a 1 year old dog. It was time for his yearly vaccinations and we were going to bring him into her work place to do them but her workplace told her to just draw them up and take them home after work to do them and I thought this was ideal as he would be home and more relaxed. \n\nOur toy poodle dog is very smart and doesn\u2019t like needles or anything vet related so my girlfriend told me how to \u201csafely\u201d restrain him while she did the vaccines quickly. We put him on our kitchen table and she told me to wrap my arm around his neck but not fully, and to put my hand under his jaw. My other arm would be behind his butt so he couldn\u2019t back up but the main thing was to apparently keep his head from coming back and biting her, but restraining him safely the way she told me to do it. \n\nI did what she told me but I thought it was traumatic for him. As she went to inject him my worst fears were confirmed. He yipped and I let go and he bit her. \n\nShe became irate and told me she was an idiot for not doing it at work and that I don\u2019t trust her education and clearly think she doesn\u2019t know her own profession\u2026that dogs do upset at the pinch of the needle but it\u2019s only one second. That I argue and don\u2019t listen to anything she says. I was just worried that I was hurting our dog but she clapped back saying she\u2019s been doing this for a long time and I was doing a good job until I decided to contradict her, like I apparently always do. \n\nI\u2019m pretty hurt but want to make it right. So, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: \n\nYES. I am a huge asshole. A huge, gaping asshole. \n\nI went out last night and bought my girl some expensive wine and her favourite snacks. We sat at our dining table. I took ownership fully. I told her that I DO disregard her and I don\u2019t know why but it\u2019s not out of disrespect. She amazes me constantly with her drive, the way she gets what she wants, the shit she\u2019s put up with her in her life and keeps fighting. I am a truly lucky ass man. She is a weapon of a woman. \n\nI told her how I fucked up in detail. She cried and told me she needs me to stand behind her at all times and to trust her because she knows things too\u2026I\u2019m not some all knowing being. I agreed and it wasn\u2019t difficult to agree with her when I saw firsthand just how much damage I was doing. She told me that when she tells me to hold the fucking dog, just hold the fucking dog and trust that she\u2019s doing it so neither of us get bitten. \n\nThe bite didn\u2019t draw any blood. He snapped out of it quickly when he realised he was biting mum. Our relationship isn\u2019t ending. I\u2019m going to therapy and doing the work. I fucked up but I\u2019m doing to work and that\u2019s what matters.

However, you decided that you knew better than this person and didn\u2019t bother. Then the scenario that the gentle restraint was for, happened. The vet tech was injured and your dog experienced more distress too as a result. That makes you an asshole. \n\nNow add back in that this professional is your girlfriend, who was injured as a direct result of your disrespect for her. That makes you an even bigger asshole. Add on the fact that she mentions you never listen to and always contradict her, well \u2026 \n\nYOUR feelings were hurt by hearing the truth? How do you think she feels?", "Bro your girlfriend is a literal vet.

Not only did you decide to ignore your girlfriend\u2019s valid instructions based on her experience, you did so without warning, at the last minute, and at a point in the process when she was most likely to get hurt \u2014 and she did get hurt. Doesn\u2019t matter if your dog\u2019s a toy poodle, your actions caused her to be on the receiving end of a bite. In other words, you prioritized limiting your dog\u2019s \u201ctrauma\u201d over your girlfriend\u2019s safety. Personally, I\u2019d have a VERY hard time ever trusting you again and if this is truly a repeat behavior on your end, I hope your girlfriend realizes that this is just who you are and leaves.

Instead, you freaked out at the first yelp and let him go. \n\nThat a) let him bite your girlfriend, and b) opened him up to further injury, by moving while there was a needle in him. You did the worst possible thing that you could have chosen to do. And you did that even though your girlfriend told you why it was important to hold him still and checked that you were okay to do it. \n\nAnd then you have the absolute gall to come and check with random internet strangers about whether your girlfriend is right that you acted badly?! Wow, dude. You can't even trust her that much?! Even though she's a vet tech and literally does this all day as part of her job?!\n\nYes. Of course you're the asshole here.", "YTA what you did was dangerous and could've also hurt your dog you were so concerned about too.

She is aware dogs can get grumpy and bite, thus why she needed you to keep the dog in a specific position. The dog was not in any danger. At most he was a bit uncomfortable for just a minute. He wasn't traumatized. But because of you letting go, she got bit.\n\nYou have shown you cannot be trusted to help. I sure wouldn't trust you to keep the restraint for just a second. Dogs can get upset at needles, just like humans do, but it wouldn't have been trauma.\n\n>I\u2019m pretty hurt\n\nYou are hurt? You weren't the one bit. You litterally are not being helpful for your own dog's well being.  \n\n\nETA: I shadowed a vet tech as a teenager cause I wanted to be one once. While I wasn't allowed to do anything but help give food/water to the kitties/puppies, maybe help hold something for em, etc...they did have me help retrain a dog the same way your gf described as their partner was in the middle of something. Yes, I was a 16 year old and technically untrained, but if you listen to dirrection anyone could've done this right. It's not rocket science, not some super hard complicated thing. OP just lacked the most basic common sense in this event.", "Lmfao. 31, can't follow instructions, and makes it about himself.

It's harmful to trust anyone who has weaponized incompetence and a victim mentality\n\n2. \"No good deed goes unpunished\"", "YTA. Held properly, the dog would have felt secure, and she wouldn't have been bitten.

Still needs restrained tho if he moves wrong he could get hurt worse", "YTA. She\u2019s a professional, not you. She\u2019s aware of what will and will not hurt the dog.

Time for you to grow up, and learn that in some circumstances, you have to follow the directions of the professional in the situation.", "As a fellow vet tech, yes YTA.\nThe entire purpose of proper restraint is to keep every participant safe, including your dog. Animals sometimes cry when poked with a sharp needle. It happens all day, every day. Anyone performing treatments places all of their trust into their restrainer to keep control over the situation and keep everyone safe.

We have a loving, easy relationship. My gf is a vet tech and we have a 1 year old dog. It was time for his yearly vaccinations and we were going to bring him into her work place to do them but her workplace told her to just draw them up and take them home after work to do them and I thought this was ideal as he would be home and more relaxed. \n\nOur toy poodle dog is very smart and doesn\u2019t like needles or anything vet related so my girlfriend told me how to \u201csafely\u201d restrain him while she did the vaccines quickly. We put him on our kitchen table and she told me to wrap my arm around his neck but not fully, and to put my hand under his jaw. My other arm would be behind his butt so he couldn\u2019t back up but the main thing was to apparently keep his head from coming back and biting her, but restraining him safely the way she told me to do it. \n\nI did what she told me but I thought it was traumatic for him. As she went to inject him my worst fears were confirmed. He yipped and I let go and he bit her. \n\nShe became irate and told me she was an idiot for not doing it at work and that I don\u2019t trust her education and clearly think she doesn\u2019t know her own profession\u2026that dogs do upset at the pinch of the needle but it\u2019s only one second. That I argue and don\u2019t listen to anything she says. I was just worried that I was hurting our dog but she clapped back saying she\u2019s been doing this for a long time and I was doing a good job until I decided to contradict her, like I apparently always do. \n\nI\u2019m pretty hurt but want to make it right.

The first time my dog got vaccinated he reacted like we stabbed him, he\u2019d limp and look at his leg then at us (and the vet) like we had ripped his leg off, very offended. Nowadays, he yelps and then he\u2019s fine, because as long as you don\u2019t make the experience worse than it needs to be, the dog just kinda gets used to it.", "I dunno - my pooch had to get a series of xrays for a leg she injured, and she got bitey, and they asked me if they could put a muzzle on her, and I said, \u201cAbsolutely, yes,\u201d and put it on her myself, so I know bitey little bastards.

Apparently you keep deliberately missing the part where she was told to do it at home.", "It is actually a very valid concern.  We tend to only refer to grown women as children.  We don't do this to men.  Infantilizing women contributes to a lot of issues, including scenarios like this where a basic man thinks he knows better than his professional partner.\n\nLanguage matters.", "It\u2019s not an argument, it\u2019s pointing out how women are often infantilised or subtly belittled by being called girls instead of women in inappropriate contexts. Think about how strange it would feel to call an adult man a boy.", "This is how language is used to infantilize women.", "What an absolutely inane reply. Do you still call them \"colored people\" too? Language matters.", "Muzzles, literally every vet demands muzzles so her professionalism is not all that great either.\n\nAnd in vets office, the setup does NOT require the owner to perfectly restrain stressed dog.", "I was with dog for vaccination and every single time muzzles was required and I did not had to perfectly restrain the dog. All of the vets handled vaccination with only minimal cooperation from me.", "A bite can still cause damage, regardless of size.", "Well, you see, his girlfriend was the one upset, and she's got a vagina, which immediately makes her criticism invalid. He only accepts criticism from people with penises (or with unknown genitalia, here on the internet), so he had to hear the exact same thing his girlfriend said from a couple hundred strangers of indeterminate gender in order for the criticism to be valid.\n\nI'm exaggerating for comedic effect, but between his response of suddenly Getting It once people here told him off, and him mentioning in the OP that she says he never listens to her...our buddy here has a selective listening problem at best, a major sexism problem at worst.", "More to the point, why didn't he listen to his girlfriend when *she* told him how he fucked up?  I think OP has revealed that this isn't a one-time occurrence but his normal behavior toward her.", "The dog still could\u2019ve caused damage when it but her. The dog could\u2019ve got hurt in the process.", "Not everyone.  That's not common for mine.  The vets around here have a second employee help restrain.", "And was responsible for making sure it was done. \n\nLiability isn\u2019t about who did it, it\u2019s about who is responsible for what happened. Sometimes it\u2019s the one who did it, often it is someone else who had a duty to prevent it. \n\nI say it\u2019s the latter. You can disagree, but that just means you\u2019re an idiot for thinking I\u2019m an idiot for thinking she\u2019s an idiot. \u2764\ufe0f", "Really? He even admitted that he thought holding the dog would be traumatic for the dog. He tried to defend his actions against someone who actually happens to know what she\u2019s talking about.

Not because he didn't trust her.", "Vaccinations aren't the same thing as stitches, and OP wasn't being asked to hold the dog down for stitches. If you think they'll bust out table restraints to give an infant the size of a toy poodle a vaccine then idk what to tell you.", "It\u2019s pretty common to restrain your own dog during vaccinations. Your dog trusts you and knows they\u2019re safe with you so being restrained by a stranger usually freaks them out more. You also don\u2019t need a degree in veterinary medicine to restrain your own pet.", "Sadly, there are tons of people who will tell their mechanic how to fix their car.

There are people who think they know better than everyone, always.", "If you've found a hidden portal to the alternate reality where social gender dynamics don't exist, can you let me know where it is? I'd love to visit sometime.\n\nUntil then, here in the real world, there are patterns of behavior that frequently fall along gendered lines, and there's nothing wrong with noticing that when it's applicable. As it is here, since \"man decides he knows more about a topic than a woman who literally studies/teaches/is a SME in that topic\" is one of the most common gendered behavior patterns out there.", "That's a really great question. Why IS this always a man thing? You hear about men doing this all the time but rarely hear about women doing it. So yeah, why is it a man thing? What does gender have to do with it?

A good thing about it imo is that it\u2019s never too late, you just need the right approach and a grown dog can easily get around to it. All you have to do is introduce the crate as a place of leisure for your dog. Have the crate available, open, with blanket/cushion and a bone or toy at all times of day and night.

Notice that if you were to call men 'boys', they would likely be offended and feel emasculated.  In fact, it's often used as a way to imply that they are behaving like children.
