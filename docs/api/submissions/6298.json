Because if this was me, I would've at some point made a joke, or even a comment at-least, to my friend regarding them mispronouncing my name. It would've given me the chance to explain that I *know* they are pronouncing it the best they can, but so they could be aware that that is the acceptable name they call you, but not your correct given name. But then I realised, *this person is not your friend, they are your colleague.* WTF! It's valid to not have corrected them, especially when you had already (kinda) done so by pronouncing your name correctly every time. Although one thing that strikes me at the ending, is that you didn't comment on confronting this colleague, perhaps to settle the tenseness in the team that you mentioned. Are you maybe a little non-confrontational? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but if thats the case it could bring a little clarity on how these people perceive you.\n\nNot the asshole.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt is your name and if you don't care about how it is being butchered, what is the problem.  \n\n\nPersonally as a south Indian person with a weird name (for foreigners) working with the team that is from both China, USA.  \n\n\nConsider giving yourself an nickname (preferably in English) which is easy to pronounce.  \n\n\nThe foreigners take offence if you misspell their names, and assumed it was the same with others also.  \n\n\nSit down with your team and inform them about why you did not care before and ensure they understand it.", "NTA.\n\nI think people with easy to pronounce names take it for granted that you'd want to correct mispronunciations.\n\nMy name is easy to pronounce but people get it wrong a lot since it's not from the country I live. I've hard people argue with me about the pronoun caution of MY name -.-\n\nI just stopped correcting some people like teachers/ randoms and I've had them be upset I didn't correct them. I just stopped caring so I don't know why it's upsetting for them", "NTA. As another Indian, I can understand the pain of getting your name mispronounced and not wanting to correct people all the time. I used to try to correct people at least once or twice but even that has become so tiring and often I feel as if I'm coming off as pretentious. It's perfectly fine to not be able to pronounce a difficult name. If they can't get it in one or two goes, it's likely they won't be able to catch on that quickly either. If no party has a problem with the way your name is being pronounced, it should be totally fine.\n\nOn the contrary, the way your friend lashed out saying you set them up for embarrassment seemed weird and unnecessary. It's like they're blaming you for having a name that's difficult for them to pronounce. That's no one's fault at all, especially not yours. You're definitely not the asshole here.", "In my world (social justice nonprofit) the repeated mispronunciation of a colleague\u2019s name is considered a micro-aggression. Here\u2019s the thing: it is NOT your responsibility to convince your colleagues to get your name right, it is THEIR responsibility to give you enough respect to learn it properly. Your colleague acting like you did something wrong is displacing blame for their own bad behavior onto you. Don\u2019t accept that! You were more than gracious this whole time. NTA", "NTA, if you have a name that's foreign to the country you're working in, there's always a trade off between people getting your name right vs. how it looks to them. Different people choose differently \u2013 I have a very difficult last name for English speakers and I don't correct anyone, if it's even vaguely similar I let it slide.\n\nEspecially in Eastern European countries, which tend to be ethnically homogeneous and people are already working in English which is not their native language, people let a lot slide \u2013 the Indians I know in Warsaw certainly do. Your colleague overreacted.\n\nI sorta see where she's coming from \u2013 she was made to look a little foolish in a work situation and got defensive, but she should have reacted better and accusing you of doing it intentionally is way out of line. Your friend could *maybe* have not pointed it out in front of her but come on \u2013 she overreacted and is the AH here.\n\nAnd it's Eastern Europe, expect everyone to be a bit miserable all the way through April, that's just the way it is :).", "NTA \nI've got an 'ethnic' name as well. I realized early that different languages use sounds and letters differently. The original pronunciation didn't make it out of kindergarten. Some sounds just don't exist and letters can mean something completely different in different languages.\n\nI use the standard Anglicized pronunciation in English. People have a hard time using that. I now use the common English short form professionally and have found people even have issues with that. \n\nMaybe it's because I realise that it's silly to be upset about people trying their best or because I've had my name mispronounced my entire life but feel free to butcher it as long as I can tell you're referring to me. I can easily tell when someone is being disrespectful, and it's never my name that is the real issue anyhow.", "NTA. Would it help to let your colleagues know that you weren't bothered by the various pronunciations of your name as your first languages differ, and you hope they aren't bothered by your accent or pronunciations of their names?  Maybe this will let them look at this in a different light.\n\nYou sound like a very nice easy going person, and it is lovely that you let stuff like this not affect you.  These folks are being AHs, and I hope they knock it off.", "NTA, it is your choice how you accept to be addressed. Your coworker is an AH for expecting you to lie to the new person to help her keep face. If it bothers her that much she should learn how to pronounce it better. It is your name and your experience. You have the input here", "Bizzare indeed! NTA.", "NTA. I have a five letter name that is mispronounced more often than people get it right. It's rarely worth it to correct people anymore.", "NTA and the colleague that said that you were setting her up for failure is being dramatic. \n\nI understand the reaction from the others on the team though. They didn\u2019t realize they were saying your name wrong, and now they\u2019re embarrassed. You\u2019re still NTA though!", "NTA\n\nThis is gonna sound stupid but if people can not only learn to say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious but also sing it, they can learn to pronounce your name. May take them a few tries as they have to relearn how certain letters go together that make new sounds that they arent used to. You like these people enough to give them the title \"friends\" if they werent friends i wouldn't be bothered enough to teach em.\n\nAlso I think them saying \"setting them up failure\" ect makes them the asshole and you can do better because all you were doing was trying to make it easier for them. Its kinda stupid them taking something that is your personal thing and making it their issue and about them.", "NTA. It's your name and if you choose to not correct it that's your business.", "NTA. If they were your friends it could be worth coaching them further, but coworkers? Nope. That's just extra work for you that may not pay off and could backfire. \n\n\nI have a LOT of trouble with d's that sound like th's or with the pulled back r, and even hearing them correctly is difficult, but I'd do my absolute best to get it right for a coworker or friend. I've been practicing some of it already since I saw a video where a guy was explaining it with where your tongue should be in your mouth and everything - your friends should too!", "NTA.   I think that it\u2019s quite gracious to allow people to mispronounce your name.\n\nMy brother married a woman from France, with a very French name.  She was patient teaching me how to pronounce it, but the first time I heard her say it I had a tongue tied moment when tried to work out how to make my mouth form that sound.  I don\u2019t know *what* I spat out, but it definitely was not her name!\n\nIf I\u2019d been meeting her as a colleague instead of a sister-in-law-to-be, I\u2019d definitely have appreciated a bit of grace in my monolingual fumbling.", "NTA. People mispronounce my easy name all the time and I don't correct them.", "NTA, with a caveat. I have never been able to produce a rolling \u2018r\u2019 sound, so it\u2019s understandable that there are certain sounds that might be difficult to produce if you haven\u2019t learned them when young but it\u2019s a different matter if they are using the wrong inflections or letters entirely.\n\nAs someone once said - if we can learn Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s name without issue we should be able to learn other longer names and saying they are from a different culture and too difficult to learn is disrespectful and basically racist. \n\nIf they can\u2019t take the hint that you say your name in a particular way and they don\u2019t use the same pronunciation then at best they are tactless idiots. It would be fair to correct them once, but you shouldn\u2019t have to do it more than that.", "Nta I get that it's embarrassing for them to have messes up your name. I worked with a lovely Doctor for 3 years and said his name wrong for 2.5 of them.  I mostly saw it written down.  A nurse finally corrected me.  When he came in next I asked why he never corrected me, and he said it was a common mispronounceation and not a big deal to him. I still felt like a dick, but he didn't think it was a big deal so I didn't make a big deal out of it.", "NTA, as someone with a difficult to pronounce name, I honestly don't care if coworkers pronounce it slightly wrong. They also act really weird when I do correct them even when they're pronouncing it completely wrong (like interposing letters)... And then they continue to mispronounce it so after I correct them. It's such a pain in the ass and honestly just awkward. I only care if friends and romantic partners pronounce it correctly, because I just don't have time or energy to correct and re-correct people over and over.", "My last name is commonly mispronounced. It would be exhausting to correct it all the time. I do exactly as OP, and say my own name correctly. Occasionally someone will pick up on it. Sometimes they\u2019ll act surprised and then go right back to mispronunciation. OP is not responsible for their colleague\u2019s embarrassment due to ignorance. Totally NTA", "NTA.  I would tell them just what you said here- \"My name is hard to pronounce. That's fine, I'm not offended when people say it wrong.   I don't make a big deal out of it if it is said incorrectly but I always say it correctly.  What would you prefer me to do in the future? \"  and wee what they say.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know that English speakers won't pronounce my name really correctly because they don't have all the sounds. The vowels just aren't the same and the double consonant is a bit iffy. I know I probably don't pronounce names from other languages correctly either because my language doesn't have the sounds. It took me years to \"get\" the English sounds that we don't have and I think I'm still butchering schwa and my /a/ probably isn't quite where it should be. Same with French (the nasals and the two /e/ sounds...). And that is after practicing with IPA charts. Or something like Japanese long vowels that a lot of westerners may not even hear (or they mishear) because they are like 1.5 vowels long.\n\nSo that said, I don't think we can expect perfection from others.
