It would've given me the chance to explain that I *know* they are pronouncing it the best they can, but so they could be aware that that is the acceptable name they call you, but not your correct given name. But then I realised, *this person is not your friend, they are your colleague.* WTF! It's valid to not have corrected them, especially when you had already (kinda) done so by pronouncing your name correctly every time. Although one thing that strikes me at the ending, is that you didn't comment on confronting this colleague, perhaps to settle the tenseness in the team that you mentioned.

I just stopped caring so I don't know why it's upsetting for them", "NTA. As another Indian, I can understand the pain of getting your name mispronounced and not wanting to correct people all the time. I used to try to correct people at least once or twice but even that has become so tiring and often I feel as if I'm coming off as pretentious. It's perfectly fine to not be able to pronounce a difficult name. If they can't get it in one or two goes, it's likely they won't be able to catch on that quickly either. If no party has a problem with the way your name is being pronounced, it should be totally fine.\n\nOn the contrary, the way your friend lashed out saying you set them up for embarrassment seemed weird and unnecessary. It's like they're blaming you for having a name that's difficult for them to pronounce. That's no one's fault at all, especially not yours. You're definitely not the asshole here.", "In my world (social justice nonprofit) the repeated mispronunciation of a colleague\u2019s name is considered a micro-aggression. Here\u2019s the thing: it is NOT your responsibility to convince your colleagues to get your name right, it is THEIR responsibility to give you enough respect to learn it properly. Your colleague acting like you did something wrong is displacing blame for their own bad behavior onto you. Don\u2019t accept that! You were more than gracious this whole time.

Your colleague overreacted.\n\nI sorta see where she's coming from \u2013 she was made to look a little foolish in a work situation and got defensive, but she should have reacted better and accusing you of doing it intentionally is way out of line. Your friend could *maybe* have not pointed it out in front of her but come on \u2013 she overreacted and is the AH here.\n\nAnd it's Eastern Europe, expect everyone to be a bit miserable all the way through April, that's just the way it is :).", "NTA \nI've got an 'ethnic' name as well. I realized early that different languages use sounds and letters differently. The original pronunciation didn't make it out of kindergarten. Some sounds just don't exist and letters can mean something completely different in different languages.\n\nI use the standard Anglicized pronunciation in English. People have a hard time using that. I now use the common English short form professionally and have found people even have issues with that. \n\nMaybe it's because I realise that it's silly to be upset about people trying their best or because I've had my name mispronounced my entire life but feel free to butcher it as long as I can tell you're referring to me. I can easily tell when someone is being disrespectful, and it's never my name that is the real issue anyhow.", "NTA.

These folks are being AHs, and I hope they knock it off.", "NTA, it is your choice how you accept to be addressed. Your coworker is an AH for expecting you to lie to the new person to help her keep face. If it bothers her that much she should learn how to pronounce it better. It is your name and your experience. You have the input here", "Bizzare indeed! NTA.", "NTA. I have a five letter name that is mispronounced more often than people get it right. It's rarely worth it to correct people anymore.", "NTA and the colleague that said that you were setting her up for failure is being dramatic. \n\nI understand the reaction from the others on the team though. They didn\u2019t realize they were saying your name wrong, and now they\u2019re embarrassed. You\u2019re still NTA though!", "NTA\n\nThis is gonna sound stupid but if people can not only learn to say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious but also sing it, they can learn to pronounce your name. May take them a few tries as they have to relearn how certain letters go together that make new sounds that they arent used to. You like these people enough to give them the title \"friends\" if they werent friends i wouldn't be bothered enough to teach em.\n\nAlso I think them saying \"setting them up failure\" ect makes them the asshole and you can do better because all you were doing was trying to make it easier for them. Its kinda stupid them taking something that is your personal thing and making it their issue and about them.", "NTA. It's your name and if you choose to not correct it that's your business.", "NTA.

I think that it\u2019s quite gracious to allow people to mispronounce your name.\n\nMy brother married a woman from France, with a very French name.  She was patient teaching me how to pronounce it, but the first time I heard her say it I had a tongue tied moment when tried to work out how to make my mouth form that sound.  I don\u2019t know *what* I spat out, but it definitely was not her name!\n\nIf I\u2019d been meeting her as a colleague instead of a sister-in-law-to-be, I\u2019d definitely have appreciated a bit of grace in my monolingual fumbling.", "NTA. People mispronounce my easy name all the time and I don't correct them.", "NTA, with a caveat. I have never been able to produce a rolling \u2018r\u2019 sound, so it\u2019s understandable that there are certain sounds that might be difficult to produce if you haven\u2019t learned them when young but it\u2019s a different matter if they are using the wrong inflections or letters entirely.\n\nAs someone once said - if we can learn Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s name without issue we should be able to learn other longer names and saying they are from a different culture and too difficult to learn is disrespectful and basically racist. \n\nIf they can\u2019t take the hint that you say your name in a particular way and they don\u2019t use the same pronunciation then at best they are tactless idiots. It would be fair to correct them once, but you shouldn\u2019t have to do it more than that.", "Nta I get that it's embarrassing for them to have messes up your name. I worked with a lovely Doctor for 3 years and said his name wrong for 2.5 of them.  I mostly saw it written down.  A nurse finally corrected me.

I still felt like a dick, but he didn't think it was a big deal so I didn't make a big deal out of it.", "NTA, as someone with a difficult to pronounce name, I honestly don't care if coworkers pronounce it slightly wrong. They also act really weird when I do correct them even when they're pronouncing it completely wrong (like interposing letters)... And then they continue to mispronounce it so after I correct them. It's such a pain in the ass and honestly just awkward. I only care if friends and romantic partners pronounce it correctly, because I just don't have time or energy to correct and re-correct people over and over.", "My last name is commonly mispronounced. It would be exhausting to correct it all the time. I do exactly as OP, and say my own name correctly. Occasionally someone will pick up on it.

Like you, the different pronunciations don\u2019t bother me, and I often think they\u2019re quite pretty. Not one single time has anyone ever gotten mad at me when they don\u2019t say my name correctly. Frustrated, sure. But mad? That feels like some next level entitlement.", "English speakers sometimes have trouble pronouncing French and Spanish names.  Been curious about it.  Find that Spanish requires a rolling of some letters and a difference in the treatment of some letters (j pronounced as h). French seems to require a very distinctive muscle action of the lips not present in English. Is this an issue for English speakers learning Indian pronunciation.  If so, it may be that inattentive people hearing your name automatically take the easiest and most familiar pronunciation of unfamiliar words.  \n\nWhen i first speak with an English speaking person with a different native language, their accent makes their speech hard to understand.  Doesn\u2019t take long for that to go away and the ear and brain adapt.  One has to focus though.\n\nThinking the person who was embarrassed was so because she knew she had not made the effort and that you let it slide.  You didn\u2019t see the point in constantly making an issue of it so she just doesn\u2019t want it to be her fault that she was lazy.  \n\nYour tolerance is diplomatic.  No matter what you do, someone will be resentful.  How do you handle pronouncing names unfamiliar in your language?", "NTA. I have a rare last name that almost everybody mispronounces in the same way. Close, but not quite. I stopped correcting people when I was 12, I'm not bothered by the mispronunciation, and I barely hear it anymore. Every now and then a long time friend will overhear me say my last name, and they're usually shocked, but I've never had anyone get angry at me for never correcting them. Your colleague is being unreasonable.", "For the entire time I went to college a guy called me Steve. My name is not Steve.", "I'll vote NTA, as that wasn't your intention. I also have a name that people often say incorrectly, and I just respond to however they say it. I even joke and tell people they can just say \"hey you\" and I'll probably respond.\nThat said, maybe talking to some of the worried coworkers and offering a breakdown pronunciation of your name would be nice. I've done this with some of my friends, who hate getting names wrong, and they appreciated it.", "NTA...I have a fairly uncommon but straight forward spelled name that people have butchered since infancy. Unless it was a name that bothered me, I don't think I really need to correct them. BTW, did any of the other coworkers ever try to make an effort at looking up/investigating your name? I'm a very curious person and I would have asked you a million questions and looked it up if you didn't have time to explain.", "I'm in sales and can't stand when coworkers use misprounounced last name for clients. I find it disrespectful. I would spell the name out phoenetically for the subcontractors and office staff so they know the correct pronunciation. Maybe this would help your coworkers with your name??", "Like Uzoamaka Aduba\u2019s mom said \u2018If they can learn to say Tchaikovsky, Dostoyevsky, & Michelangelo, they can learn to say Uzoamaka\u2019 - it\u2019s not that hard to pronounce peoples names correctly.", "Sometimes the best they can IS the best they can.\n\nI worked with a guy who immigrated from India (not sure when) and he had a VERY heavy accent.  My name is Sandy, simple to pronounce, like sand on a beach.  The closest he could get sounded like \u2019sawn-DEE\u2019.  Mispronounced?  Maybe by native English speakers, but the his language construct, it was the best he could do.  He knew my name, I knew he was talking to me, and it was close enough.\n\nOur work place had many immigrants from all over the world, all with their own language rules.  Some names can\u2019t be proper said without rolling letters, or sound like you\u2019re coughing up phlegm.  So long as someone is doing their best, why shame them?", "Some lady was trying to tell me how it was pronounced I was like ur putting the syllable break wrong ur meant to pause here and she looks at me and says 'I don't think so' \ud83d\udc80", "Exactly! Unless it's someone I'm gonna  meet multiple times I don't care haha", "Same lol. I don't really care how people pronounce it", "I have this problem and I hate it . Like you correct people and it doesn\u2019t go anywhere so you just give up , but then people are upset after they realize it\u2019s wrong and you end up comforting them for mispronouncing your name - no win social situation. I did start spelling my name differently a few years ago so at least on zoom meetings people are more likely to get it right. Good luck!", "Long Hindi surnames are so beautiful and poetic though - it\u2019s not unfortunate!", ">so, yes OP is uncomfortable with taking on an English name,\n\nHey, I am not forcing anyone to do anything, Just giving suggestion based on what I have experienced.  \n\n\nYou like the suggestion, take it. Otherwise ignore and I have No problem with that.  \n\n\nI Just explained to the OP as to why taking a English nickname is not the start of identity erasure and explained from POV.  \n\n\n>I do believe that expecting people to take on English names for the comfort of their co-workers is unnecessary, rude, and forced erasure\n\nDid I ever mention anywhere it the comments that the nickname I have taken is for the comfort of the co workers?  \n\n\nAgain if you go through the post and this thread properly, you will understand that we never had the issue with the co workers butchering the name.  \n\n\nWe know that with the different language barrier, expecting the foreign co workers to properly pronounce the names is a exercise which is just wasting time and effort unless they are sort of like constant and not meeting them one off.  \n\n\nBut atleast in the OPs case, it was the co workers who thought they were properly pronouncing the names and started guilt tripping the OP once it got revealed that the pronunciation was not proper thus creating the drama.  \n\n\nHaving a nick name which is easy to pronounce will ensure that the introductions will be done quicker when meeting new people, get down to business and finish the conversation quickly.  \n\n\nOther wise we should try spending 5 to 10 mins (min) going back on forth on the pronunciation of the name reaching a dead end (they still are not able to pronounce the name properly) resigning our self to the butchering of the name or give a nickname which is easy to pronounce so that the talk can proceed further.  \n\n\nAnyway with the nickname, you avoid all this issues from coming up and wanted to convey that taking up a nickname is just a business decision (which does not mean that if you do take it, causes you to lose your identity) which will help reduce the issues in the workplace and prevent them from coming up in the future.", "NTA it\u2019s your name they shouldn\u2019t be upset because they can\u2019t say it right", "NTA. As someone who has had her name mispronounced for 40 years I get it. Half the times I don't even think about it lol. The people who matter to me know how it's pronounced and the rest will learn if they want\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I had a teacher in HS all 4 years and twice a day for my junior and senior year and to this day she still mispronounces my name no matter how many times I corrected her\ud83d\ude44.", "NTA. When I deal with difficult foreign names, I write them out phonetically in a manner that I can remember and understand. Works every time. Do your colleagues a favor and offer them the correct pronunciation of your name. Most people do embrace foreign cultures and names more than you might expect.", "\"If they can learn to say Tchaikovsky and Michelangelo and Dostoyevsky they can learn to say Uzoamaka.\"\n\nI love this quote from Uzoamaka Aduba because my name is also \"difficult\"- my name has a w that is pronounced like a V, and people often mistake the first letter for an E rather than an A. Your coworker could have asked again. It's my habit to repeat the name and have the person correct me so I get it right. She didn't want to make the effort and is embarrassed to look ignorant. NTA.", " NTA! This is your *name* and you\u2019re allowed to pronounce it correctly!!!", "NTA. It gets exhausting correcting people at work. My last name is one syllable and very easy to pronounce. It\u2019s a common word in the English language, but it\u2019s spelled differently so no one ever gets it right on the first go (except when I was in France, which was cool!). After correcting people a few times it gets very awkward when they continue to do it. I don\u2019t blame you for not correcting it.", "As a teacher, I really do try to pronounce everyone\u2019s names correctly. We have kids from over 40 different countries, so some have difficult sounds/pronunciations for me as someone who primarily speaks English. I continue to try and do encourage them to correct me. As someone who has a last name that is often butchered, I understand getting tired of correcting people too! I let it go after a couple times because it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s worth the effort.", ">Can you provide them with a phonetic version of your name to help them sound it out?  Not saying you have to, but that might be easier for them to \"practice\"."]}
