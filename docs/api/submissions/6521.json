Every year our familly is celebrating christmas at my parent's house. Never ever have they requested that we pay for anything or for any event. But they are are starting to get old.

Because my sister host last year, this christmas was supposed to be at my place or at my parent's. But my parents we're in the middle of moving out so their place wasn't an option. At that moment, my sister offer to host for the same reason as last year. I was fine with it. In exchange of not hosting, I offered I would come early to help with preparation and bring dessert. But 3 days before christmas my sister texted me telling me it would be 165$ per family for the food and to bring my own alcohol. My mom and I were livid. Never have she warned us about this and never has it been a \"familly thing\" to pay the host. She told me that because she already hosted last year christmas and was in a lot of student debt (which i am too) and it was a normal thing in her boyfriend familly to pay the host. I told her i wouldn't come if I had to pay and that she was disrespecfull after all the time I invited her for events and never made her pay a pennie. I also told her that if she had the money to go on trips (mexico etc) every year she should have the money to pay for christmas dinner and that she was a cheap hypocrite.

And what the hell is she cooking that it costs $165 per family?", "In this case NTA\n\nI get that hosting a holiday dinner isn't cheap, but then the cost should have been discussed ahead of time and action taken then and not sprung on you 3 days prior. \n\nAlso - wtf?  165$ per family?  What are you all eating?  Prime rib and caviar?  You sure they're looking for \"help with the cost\" and not just looking to pad their own pockets?", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t discussed ahead of time. What if the $165 was too steep for someone? Had she said she\u2019d need financial help, or that she\u2019d provide the space if someone else provided that food, that would\u2019ve been fine. \n\nAlso: Since she hosted two years in a row it can be inferred that she wouldn\u2019t expect to do it again until everyone else caught up.", "NTA. I have a sister that charged me for wrapping paper and tape on gifts for my mom, I stopped splitting gifts with her.", "Nta. You dont invite people over and charge a fee like its a club. If you cant afford it, dont host. Or ask people to bring a dish or two so everyone contributes. 165 is ridiculous and abitrary as well", "Nta\n\nJudgement is entirely because she offered. If she didn't have the money to do it, she shouldn't have offered. \n\nAnd her logic of why everyone owes her x amount isn't because that's a breakdown of food costs, she wants people to pay extra because she has bills, which is pretty tacky on her part.", "This is when I would have said, \u201c*Not no- but ***hell*** no. Everyone can just come to my house. I\u2019ll host Christmas this year, and your butt can stay home figuring out exactly when you\u2019ll need to start filing for bankruptcy.*\u201d\n\nNTA.", "Nta - but only because your sister tried to change the customary way your family does things at the last minute and without getting input. Asking (not telling) people to help with the costs of a family dinner is reasonable - especially if people are struggling financially. But you don't get to unilaterally decide to change things.", "NTA-to start of she was the one who offered! but it is totally ok to ask people to chip in and bring something, let\u2019s be honest hosting any party is not gonna be cheap. but asking you to pay for each family is absurd! \n\non the other hand i do think you were rude in calling her a cheap hypocrite, that was insensitive. and you did already offer to help.  you could have instead worked something out or had a talk with her. but over nta", "NTA It's family and if she needed money she could have called you and explained situation and ask if you can contribute something. But demanded it, that's crossing a line. In which case even if you payed that amount it better be best meal you had and obviously you wouldn't helped cuz if you pay you kinda ina restaurant so you just eat.", "Nta, sounds like it was your sister bf idea/brought it up to her. Since his family does that your guys should to. You are allowed to choose if you want to pay to go someone\u2019s event.", "NTA\n\nfamily events being free is a pretty big draw. \n\nIts almost like they didn't want anyone to come.", "NTA, there is nothing wrong with her wanting people to chip in for Christmas, but that is not a last minute, unilateral thing to spring at Christmas. \n\nShe should have discussed before hand and the three of you could have agreed to it or another arrangement.", "Nta.\n\nMy family divides the tasks between us. \n\nEach person has a task:\n\n1. All the bread,\n2. Dessert,\n3. Lamb or Pork,\n4. Veggies. \n\nDepending on how many of us are attending, we may add more food, but we share it, and it's swapped in each year.  We are also starting to do two events each Christmas because of family members visiting in-laws, etc. \n\nWe never ask for money. It's rude and causes fights.", "NTA.\n\nI would never, ever charge anyone anything when inviting people over for any reason.\n\nThis is also a family dinner, a once-a-year occasion. The one time you guys are all together. It's unacceptable.", "NTA. If she offered to host the party and her sister offers to help out I think she should pay for it or at least ask the whole family pay some too.", "ESH. She should have made it clear that she could only host if all families split the cost and then found a mutually agreed amount people could afford.  You for turning this into a respect issue and calling her cheap instead of just telling her the dinner is too expensive for you and you\u2019d have to decline to go. I don\u2019t care how many vacations she goes on. That information is not relevant.", "ESH\n\nMy family done potluck.\n\nMaking up a bill 3 day as head unexpectedly is ass hole\n\nInsulting is ass hole.\n\nYou do not have to go, that is your choice.", "Um... ESH... Christmas dinner is not cheap, and inflation has really taken it out of people this year. Your family should communicate about the cost much farther ahead of time, and everyone should have been contributing something. \nJust because your sister has gone on a vacation, does not mean that she should carry the burden of a $500 dinner by herself. \nIn my family the host prepares the main dish, and the guests divvy up which sides to bring. Everyone contributes.", "Need more info...  how many families was she asking money from, and how many people were expected to attend?  Also, what was the menu?  If it was just your family, your parents and your sister and her boyfriend, that's 8 people/3 families, so $495 total.   My Christmas was 4 adults and 2 kids with a menu of ham, mashed potatoes, sweet potato casserole, deviled eggs, corn, and green beans, and my grocery bill was about $250 (only so high because I got a honey baked ham instead of making my own) and I live in a high cost area.  Well, now that I have written this out, I am really wondering what in the world she was planning on serving?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Menu: bruschetta, charcuterie board (cheese and meat), tourtiere (that my mom did), turkey, potato salade, pasta salade, mashed potatos and dessert (that I paied beforehand that my father was suppose to pick up from the local bakery). It's all traditionnal family recipies. I was suppose to arrive in morning to cook everything since my sister does not know the family recipies.

If your family told you that you had to shell out $165 just to come to Christmas at their house, you would do it?", "Do you not think that peraps she shouldn't have volulinteered then?\n\nHosting comes with expectations and responsiilites. If she can't meet those, she shouldn't host. \n\nAnd as far as working it out, she could have sugessted a putuck or everyone brings a dish. That helps greatly, and its pretty common.\n\n\nAnd what are the chances she'll get the $500ish dollars and buy the minimal cheapest shit she can at walmart/go light on the courses just to pocket the cash? After all, she (but not just her) need the money.", "No, you don't charge people to spend the holiday with you.", "Asking for $165 per family is fucking ridiculous. When my husband and I host Christmas at our house, we don\u2019t ask our families for a dime. We cook dinner for everybody because that\u2019s our treat since we\u2019re hosting.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to explain any of this. What she\u2019s asking for is extremely rude and entitled. That money she\u2019s asking for probably wouldn\u2019t even pay for a dinner. The amount she\u2019s asking for sounds like a scheme to get you all to pony up money to keep her from drowning in debt. There is no way she needs *that much money* to fund a family event at her own house unless she\u2019s milking it from your family for her own selfish reasons.", "Dessert is not enough contribution, usually parents can afford Xmas diners, but now you should all contribute to expenses. Hosting is not easy or cheap, but ask her to break down the costs and to ask for opinions in advance.", "Definitely NTA, the menu sounds yummy, not $500 worth of amazing.  You probably could have worded the 'no' better.  Maybe say something about how much you thought it should have cost and the price seeming high.  But a host pretty much demanding money (especially what is more than most families' weekly grocery bill is) that close to an event is an AH.  Christmas is an expensive time for everyone, and that amount sounds like she was also adding any gifts she got you in the amount as well!", "If my sister said she couldn\u2019t afford to host Christmas unless I paid $165 for me, my husband, and my daughter to come, you bet your ass I would. We were in a tight spot, financially, this year, but I would have made it happen. \n\nIf I really really could not, I\u2019d have asked her how else I could offset it. Bring the main dish or the alcohol. Pay her back over time. Basically anything before calling her \u201ca cheap hypocrite.\u201d", "I mean, It\u2019s pretty clear that parents couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t make the 1.5h drive for Xmas dinner. So, if you don\u2019t care about getting the parents there, okay, sure, sister could have not offered. \n\nOP also could have suggested a potluck as well, instead of throwing a tantrum and calling her sister a cheap hypocrite. After she\u2019d hosted Xmas the year before, when OP didn\u2019t pay anything. There are relatively few dishes of substance that will survive a 1.5h drive, so I can see why sister suggested payment instead.", "Glad to hear that your family has infinite money. Wish it could be the same for all of us.", "So if parents can afford xmas dinner children shouldn't pay.... but if a child host... the parents should pay?", "Let's not forget that this is the second year in a row that she has hosted. With OPs math she's out $700. OP is more than happy to let her host because they are also paying back student loans. I don't care how many vacations the sister takes. If OP wants to be the saint in all this they can offer to host for the next two years but I don't see why the sister has to always foot the bill just because her place is more convenient. She did offer to host but if I were her I wouldn't any more because in this family not hosting means free food and booze.\n\nI think ESH and the sister only because she sprung up the bill last minute.", "She only did that cause she thinks its ok because it happens in her bfs family. He probably wanted the money, she shouldnt have offered to host if she cant afford to and should have asked the family about other alternatives if she cant, as opposed to charging a fee to come to christmas. Thats ridiculous. Its also never said she cant afford it, just that she has student debt, which makes her equal to OP, who has to probably pay 50$ in gas just to drive there if its 90 mins away", "What in the world is your family cooking for Christmas that costs 165 per household to make?", "I understand it can feel out of limit i called her cheap hypocrite. The reasonning is because she have money to afford a lot of trips and holidays with her boyfriend but cried out she's in debt for christmas and that she know that my parents are struggling financially and they never ask heyr for money everytime she go eat at their place for all other event. i also host a lot and never made her pay for the events i invited. Me and my sister are both student with the same amount of debt. The main difference is that her husband make more money than mine.", "Probably different countries but I paid $350 AUD (240 approx for USD) for our family dinner of 7 people. The amount of leftovers. There was a giant ass ham, 2 lamb roasts, a Turkey and a whoooole bunch of sides.\n\nEven if we factor in difference in food costs over there, no way that much money is needed.\n\nI've made like 10 litres of soup, Turkey pies to be frozen. Repeats of dinner for 3 days so I didn't have to cook again, meats been used for lunches...honestly I could have fed 20+ people comfortably with what we had. Your sister is acting weird about this money.", "It\u2019s up to the parents, usually they don\u2019t ask for contribution but if they can\u2019t afford it they can as for it. Your sister is not your parent and for that she should ask for your contribution (and not your parents), usually children can\u2019t afford it until much later in time, it\u2019s not her obligation to pay for all, specially when, as you said, you both have debts.\n\nBut she has to come clean with all the costs and should\u2019ve said it in advance.", "followup question: is it possible for your parents to just spend the night at your place, if you hosted?\n\nIf your sis couldn't afford to host, she shouldn't have offered, that part is totally cut and dry.", "I\u2019m really skeptical that you know her financial situation as well as you claim to. \n\nThat said, even assuming you do, why were you \u201clivid\u201d? Why did you not just say, that\u2019s not an expense I planned for, how can we shift things around to make it work?", "Not for this year since my GP is to old to travel.
