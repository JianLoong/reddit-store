I was thinking she was just making small talk with me, and I said I wear the backpack for people to give me some distance since I\u2019ve experienced creeps before behind me. The backpack is also smaller than a regular sized bag, so no one has ever complained about me having it at a concert.\n\nShe then suggests that there is a coat check.  I tell her I don\u2019t want to do that but thanks for the suggestion. She then insists again, now a demand to take my backpack to the coat check. I was frustrated, we are not super close to the stage and told her that another guy standing near us had a massive hiking backpack on too. She just ignored what I said and insisted I needed to coat check my bag. I simply told her that she can always move. I was technically standing in the same place since the first band and was there before her. \n\nWell then my guy friend decides to stand in between me and this girl, as to make it easier to not deal with her. She talks to my guy friend and apparently tells him that I\u2019m a \u201cbug\u201d for not checking in my bag.\n\nI was pretty ticked off, but my boyfriend told me that when I turned around to talk to him, he did notice my backpack hit her slightly.

He immediately apologized and turned it around to wear on his front. Ever since then, he wears it on his front and no one has ever complained about it.  \n\nI think both of you were a bit of an AH.

People are going to crowd together, and personal space is essentially non-existent. That's the whole point. If you didn't want people invading your personal space, you should've chosen another type of ticket/seat.  \n\nNow I would make an exception for a small fanny pack or cross body bag if you have to have something critical with you like medication or sugar treats if you're diabetic.

If they do it\u2019s fair game (where I live the most you get is a small clear bag).", "NTA\n\nIf security cleared your bag, you're fine. It's not up to her to add to the rules.

You hit her with your backpack at least once.

If you are dancing at all, then you are probably hitting innocent people that paid to be there too.  I've been behind and next to that person who may be a little under the influence with a backpack on and when they dance, they whack everyone around them.", "Yes. Yes you are. Please stop doing that.", "Light yta, it is just a bit rude for anyone to have a big bulky backpack as it impedes the view. But with you dancing you likely hit her a lot. I know she was also rude. But I would have been pissed off at you too", "NTA. I get it about being freaked out by people who crowd right up on you at shows.  I think the backpack is a genius idea.  I just wear circle skirts with ginormous crinolines under as a natural barrier to keep people a couple of steps out of my personal space.", "NTA. Maybe you have a medical issue that requires you to keep needed supplies on you at all times. Maybe you have something in the backpack that is too valuable to leave at coat check. Maybe your backpack is full of stuffies. The point is, it\u2019s none of her business.", "NTA\nYou are allowed to have an backpack and it is non of her business.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like the bad was blocking her view. You gave a very valid reason for wearing it, so you needed to leave you alone after that. Actually, she had no business confronting you about it in the first place. I think that is a brilliant idea by the way. After attending a general admission concert this summer, it would have been nice to bring in a backpack to provide some buffer space between me and the guy behind me who kept hitting me in the back of the head trying to record the concert.", "If you\u2019re a bug, then she was a gnat. \n\nNTA. If the venue allowed you to enter with it, then how is it her business?", "NTA\n\nAs long as she was just a concert seer and not a staff, you're good. She can move if it's such a problem.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing you have a backpack and are the one squeezing past groups who showed up before you to force yourself into a more crowded area, that\u2019s not ok. But if you were in that spot first and your backpack is hitting someone, they could simply not be so close to you. Small backpacks, crossbody bags, fannypacks, and Camelbaks are super common at festivals and long concerts.", "NTA. I'm a diabetic and bring a small backpack literally everywhere. I absolutely will not hand my lifesaving medication into a cloakroom.", "ESH, but she sucks way more,\n\nI understand wearing it to avoid people behind you, but if you do wear one you should be really mindful and careful about moving around so it doesn\u2019t hit people. You\u2019re invading other people\u2019s space by hitting them with it, so it becomes her problem really.", "LOL, troll girl is pissed that the back pack is doing exactly what OP intended...keeping people from being to close.

We were not in the front at all and actually I stood behind quite a few people who had backpacks. I didn\u2019t have a big backpack, but it\u2019s not extremely small. Its not big enough for a standard 8.5x11 notebook, but is big enough that I can put a small umbrella inside.

He always got a tiny bit of space at least around his front, even if it was middle of rush hour on the subway. I have people get in my space even if there's tons of open space. And I've gotten grabbed/groped and shoved, leaned on, pushed, run into accidentally, and intentional attempts to try to force me to move - most of which doesn't happen to him and certainly doesn't happen to him frequently. I will intentionally take up as much space as possible because people think they can just take space from me. \n\nOP is NTA for taking up extra space with an allowed backpack. Crowds suck but she is entitled to take up as much space as she wants (as long as it's within venue rules.)", "I\u2019m also not obligated to accommodate just one person in the crowd.

This isn\u2019t a deep issue, this is Concert 101. \n\nGeneral admission is insanity. You will be plastered to the people around you. That\u2019s how it goes. Everyone wants to get as close as possible, so everyone pushes up. And people are dancing and jumping. It\u2019s chaos. The last time I was in the pit, I was knocked down and trampled.

People wearing the bags usually notice and apologize on the tenth time it happens.", "The ones near me, you can have a small bag, but it's got to be clear. I have a clear purse specifically for concerts and I know a lot of people do. I've never heard of being able to just wear a backpack in.", "I don't know about OP but most of the venues I've been to allow small bags (about the size of OP's). They all require a \"bag check\" (done in a special line as you enter along with the regular scans) and most require the bag to be clear.", "Depends on where the concert is. In my experience, outdoor venues are fine with them under certain restrictions, but indoor venues are typically much stricter about it. The arena I work security at contracts with a third-party company who acts as our bike and bag valet (the arena only allows purses below a certain size in).", "Depends on venue size. My favorite small venue allows purses and backpacks, my favorite big venue has a size restriction and requires bags to be clear. Either venue would have allowed a bad the size that OP is describing though. I\u2019ve been going to shows for 25 years and usually do have a backpack type purse.", "Yeah, Share the space. If troll girl was so close that she is hitting OPs backpack, then troll girl needs to back the f up.  And besides having a backpack on, what exactly was OP being a dick about? They weren't swinging it around or dancing around bumping into people. Op said there was a dude with a full hiking backpack on...did troll girl go up to that person and demand they check in their backpack? Did troll girl demand that of everyone else? Did the security demand OP check in their backpack? Did op say ANYONE Else have an issue with OP having a backpack?  No? then the problem isn't op, the problem is troll girl.\n\nAre you one of those weirdos that like to stand a few inches behind someone in line?", "tbh if i saw someone wearing a backpack in the pit my immediate thoughts would be that either this is one of the first few concerts they've been to and they haven't figured that that isn't really something that people do, or that they just don't give a fuck about anyone else. are you saying you've never been in the middle of the pit when things really get going, and unintentionally end up close and personal with someone you never meant to? it's just the way things happen when everyone gets swept up in the music. \n\nit's not an excuse for creepy guys to grope or stand with their full fronts pressed up against some girl's back, but when you go into the pit you have to accept you will be close with other people."]}
