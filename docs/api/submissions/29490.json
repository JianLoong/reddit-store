That\u2019s from my perspective, I didn\u2019t grow up eating intestines and eyeballs, but I do like a lot of different foods. I love most of her cooking.  Not everyone who is used to a \u2018white diet\u2019 is going to be able to eat authentic Chinese food.

It would annoy the hell out of me as a cook but I think it would be mean for you not to invite him to an annual family celebration over this. It would be better to try to ignore it or make jokes about it and move on. Not inviting him because he brings his own sauce is an over reaction, it makes you wonder if there\u2019s another reason you don\u2019t want him to come.

She sounds more like the Ah than ur dad and yes you\u2019re being an Ah by the sounds of it, you want to uninvite your dad from Chinese new years because he brings his own sauce.
