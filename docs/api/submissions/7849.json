It was 10000% unexpected. She was only 10, and appeared healthy until she nosedived. She was gone within 2 days. \n\nI am shell shocked and grieving while feeling like absolute crap. The only thing I ask of my roommate is to please leave me be for the weekend as I don\u2019t feel like interacting. I just want to crawl in a blanket Fort with my remaining cat and cry. \n\nShe texts me this morning that she\u2019ll be having friends over and one will be spending the night but they\u2019ll be quiet as she knows I want to rest. I immediately say no. I don\u2019t want other people in the house right now and she didn\u2019t give the required notice so it\u2019s not ok. \n\nShe\u2019s pissed calling me a jerk.

Take care of yourself. Also, does she want to expose her friends to whatever ails you in addition to the loss of your fur companion?", "NTA\n\nGive her a 30-days-notice. Problem solved.", "Honestly, soft YTA. I don't think that sounds reasonable.", "INFO: if she had asked 2 weeks ago, would you be okay with it? Or would revoke it on account of your grief? If she had asked yesterday (24 hours notice), would you have vetoed it anyway?\n\n I think you\u2019re justified in any of these scenarios but just trying to point out that the issue isn\u2019t her asking in a timely way, it\u2019s her not respecting your no.", "YTA. If she\u2019s paying rent it sucks that you just veto her having friends over because you\u2019re sad your cat died. Also out of curiosity why are you living on a college campus with a 23 year old when you\u2019re 32?", "YTA. I'm sorry your cat died, that fucking sucks and my heart is with you. But this is also your roommate's home. She pays for it. Why pay for a place you can't depend on using? I doubt you'll need the entire house to grieve in.", "ESH. It has s both of your home and you both have the right to have people over. The agreement you have about guests should be changed. The agreement should be more about the noise level of the guests and how long they can stay.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  A - she knows the rules.  B - she was expressly asked to refrain from having guests this weekend due to OP grieving - which is quite reasonable.  C - lastly, no chance college kids hit the bars and come home at night and are quiet.\n\nAfter the roommates reaction, OP should not renew the lease and if she doesn't have a lease, let her know it's time to find another place to live.", "We don\u2019t know for sure but I think it was trauma related. She was a rescued at around 5 years old from a back yard breeder and had an umbilical hernia the size of a soft ball while in active labor- for context she was a 5.5lb cat so very small. She had to have 2 reconstructive surgeries as over 60% of her organs were outside of her abdomen. That was 5 years ago. \nThe vet found it odd that she declined so suddenly but thinks perhaps she was compensating for the damage all along and her body just couldn\u2019t compensate any more. She\u2019d never been a high energy cat so I didn\u2019t notice any weight loss or lethargy over the past couple months, but it could have been happening. \n\nI am going to be on high alert with my remaining cat, but he\u2019s 4, perfectly healthy, I\u2019ve had him since he was 6 months old, he\u2019s eating, and going for a checkup Monday", "Ty. That\u2019s my thoughts too. Like I wouldn\u2019t want to bring friends over if she\u2019d been coughing up a lung for a week- I tested negative but still. What if I need to puke and her friends are taking up the bathroom getting ready And I\u2019ve had a migraine for 2 days so noise of any kind sucks. If I was only sick I could lock myself in my room with a bowl and suck it up, but add the loss and grief I just can\u2019t handle it", "I can give her 2 months notice  but I\u2019m hoping this was just a knee jerk reaction to me saying no for the first time. Usually she\u2019s pretty good, she gives short notice like once a month and then I remind her and she\u2019s good for a while. This is the first issue and that\u2019s partly why I came here. I\u2019m exhausted, sick, and not thinking straight so I couldn\u2019t tell if I was actually being unreasonable. A couple of my friends told me earlier I should just be in my room for the night and not ruin her night- but I really can\u2019t handle people being around in general and others said that\u2019s fair. So time for impartial internet people lol", "So I try to be reasonable. This is the first time I\u2019ve said no. Yesterday I lost my cat so I would have said no as well. If she had asked even monday when everything was fine I still would have asked her to change her plans to show me some compassion, but would have been more open to a discussion since things suddenly changed and might be more inclined to suck it up for a night as I\u2019d have known her plans well in advance. I feel I\u2019m in the right here as she knew 1) I\u2019m pretty sick 2) I\u2019m actively grieving a sudden loss 3) I asked her yesterday to please not talk to or bug me this weekend as I\u2019m not really up to human interaction and just want to be left alone 4) she once again did not give proper notice.   She\u2019s never had a pet so doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m impacted so much. To me it\u2019s as simple as she didn\u2019t follow our agreements and knew there\u2019s issues going on before making last minute plans.  Your right, it is more the lack of respect and compassion that\u2019s bugging me, but I feel her not respecting our agreements makes me nta regardless", "I\u2019m not. My home is 3 blocks from campus and I rent to students to subsidize income after I lost my job during COVID. I work now but am rebuilding my savings. \nAlso as said she broke our agreement by not giving notice, and like I said the veto goes both ways. She\u2019s vetoed me having a guest when she was studying for finals and I respected that. \nBut I accept your opinion", "We do have agreements on noise levels and length of stay as well. My agreements aren\u2019t for everyone and I get that but they are there for a reason. \n24hours means one night stands can\u2019t be brought back to my home, and I insist on this as I\u2019ve been assaulted by a roommates guest after the roommate passed out. I have cpstd and I do explain this and the reason for these clauses before someone rents from me. It\u2019s not for everyone and that\u2019s fine but I want to feel safe in my home. Same with my roommate. I don\u2019t want them to be struggling and have to deal with me having a party. It\u2019s about respect and open communication. Rent is cheaper than the average for my area to compensate.", "Well, is their house and they both agreed to that rule. I don't thing it's a silly thing to have a saying over who and when you have people in your house.", "Yeah, could be the flu or another nasty virus. I am sure her friends will appreciate not catching it. They can always postponed their get together if they don't want to pay anything.", "lol. We all have opinions. It's not reasonable, in mine, to be expected to stay in your room in your own home in these circumstances. You're ill and grieving. A decent person would want to give you some space when you asked for it, even without you having to rely on a technicality in the roommate agreement.", "I totally agree. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA I'm sorry about the loss of your beloved cat. You've been more than kind letting your roommate have say, but this is your house and you can put your food down and create boundaries, especially around your mental health. No guests. your room mate isn't very nice or empathetic.", "NTA. Sorry about your beloved.", "NTA. In any way, shape, or form. I'm so sorry about your cat, liver failure can happen so fast, and it's such a shock when it does. You deserve support and empathy, and you deserve time to grieve. A weekend is nothing to ask for, in a time like this. I hurt for you, and your other cat. They're such wonderful family members. Your roommate is completely lacking in empathy here, and that's the last thing you need right now. Hope you find some peace, and can cuddle up with your other cat. I imagine you're going through the residual shock, empty tiredness, and grief, and you deserve to deal with it in peace, and in a way that works for you, especially in your own home.\n\nTake care of yourself the best you can <3", "NTA \nNot only are you grieving, but you are sick.  The friends should not want around the germs from you being sick. Tell your roommate that all she has to tell her friends is that you are sick and she doesn't want them to get sick.", "NTA. I\u2019m saying the same thing as everyone else but I\u2019m so sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f This is a horrible thing to have to go through and your roommate should understand that and respect your wishes.", "NTA", "Tysm. Shock and empty is exactly how I feel, plus I\u2019m sick as a dog and just struggling. I have a video of her happy and playing Sunday night and she was gone Thursday morning. And the grief comes in waves- ill be ok and then spot her favourite toy and I\u2019m a mess for hours remembering that she\u2019ll never hunt it and bring it to me chirping that her hunt was successful. the last thing I want is to have to worry about disturbing people by bawling for an hour or being sick in the bathroom. My baby boy squeak has barley left my side and gives me lots of snuggles so that\u2019s helping", "Roommate thought it was perfectly reasonable when she both agreed to the rule and vetoed OP's guests before. Why is it unreasonable when OP does?", "I'm sorry for your loss.", "I'm glad you have him, and he you. You should never have to feel worried about disturbing others with your grief. Being sick on top of it, and ugh. I have no words. \n\nWe expect to have more time with our cats, of course this hit you out of the blue, in more ways than one.", "SHE'S NOT REALLY ASKING IF YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY NO!!!\n\nJeez, NTA, and I'm so so sorry about your cat.", "Definitely on your side. Roomie needs to find a plan b for this weekend", "Your rule is a super reasonable one and it probably saves you both from a lot of trouble. She is being massively disrespectful. You have respected her veto and yet she doesn't respect yours. Nope. Not how that works. \n\nAfter this week and once your feeling up to it you need to have a serious conversation about how this wasn't ok and how it cant happen again. \n\nAlso it may be a good idea to test if she will follow your no at a later date. \n\nIf she still doesn't or she gets argumentative over something this big it may be a good idea to rethink letting her resign another lease next year. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Grieving AND sick.  Either is good enough, and so is the lack of notice.\n\nsorry about your cat.  Those sharp little claws really dig into a person\u2019s heart.", "When my darling cat was found dead on the road, nobody would've wanted to be around me. I wandered the house going, 'I don't understand. I don't understand.' I was inconsolable, especially as my father had also died only a couple of months before (not on the road tho). Perfectly reasonable not to want people around when you're in that state. And I'm sorry. It seems to hurt so much more when you don't have time to prepare.", "All circumstances aside, the fact that this is your first time veto-ing when she herself has veto-ed is reason enough to inform my judgment.

I\u2019ve done palliative care and them passing is awful knowing it\u2019ll happen, but this is just another level for me. She wasn\u2019t outwardly sick, she was safe in my home, and there was nothing I could do\u2026 I keep forgetting cause I\u2019m in and out from cold meds. I\u2019ll wake up looking for her cause I\u2019m always used to checking for two. I put out her food this morning and cried for at least an hour. I\u2019m a mess", "I lost a cat in 2017 and I still miss her and get weepy if I think about her too much.  You need your space. NTA", "NTA. You pretty much gave your reasoning right off the bat. It\u2019s your house. You have the right to say no.", "NTA.  You're sick and lost your loved pet. I have 3 kitties (and 2 human kids) and would be devastated if one passes even though only one is \"my\" cat (the other 2 are attached to to a kid apiece). And it's your house and you've been gracious enough to be extremely fair with vetos.", "NTA at all- you deserve space in order to not only recover from your grief but your illness as well. My former roommate\u2019s former friend used to spring herself to our house without notice all the damn time and eventually it gave me a breakdown as a natural introvert. You respected your housemate\u2019s veto so it\u2019s totally unfair that she won\u2019t respect yours. Also I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your kitty.", "YTA- grieve in your own room? Tf.", "NTA I'm sorry about your cat, that's so hard, and I hope you feel better (meaning not sick anymore) very soon", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t give it another thought. No guests this weekend period. End of story.", "NTA. First, I am so sorry you lost your fur baby. Second, even if that hadn't happened. You are sick and no one needs to be there. If she is so immature that she can't understand that then she needs to go home to mommy and daddy so they can educate her in common sense and empathy. They must have skipped those lessons. Another thing. She isn't talking about one friend.

I just had something very similar happen with my feline best friend, who was also only 10. It was devastating. \n\nThe thing is, everyone who knew about it was very kind and gave me space and did their best to console me. That's how friends and family are **supposed** to react.

My mind is boggled. \n\nIf OP wants control over who comes and goes from the house then don\u2019t rent it out! But OP rented it out and gave away that power so live with it.

This is pure abuse of power.", "That's not remotely what your parent comment focused on; OP herself acknowledges she's trying to make sure she's thinking clearly; you're either ignoring or don't care about the fact that roommate has continuously abused the notice rules that she herself has used in her favor against OP. \n\nSo I guess you're saying, OP should be a doormat roommate because otherwise, the fact that she holds the lease and can evict a selfish roommate makes her empirically shittier than the roommate who disregards their mutual agreements however it benefits her?"]}
