I do the majority of the housework and childcare and I don\u2019t mind as I understand he has a hard job and works a lot. He gets the kids on the bus every morning because he leaves for work about 10 minutes afterward. All I ask of him is to do his laundry as his clothes are covered in oil and grime and need to go in by themselves and pick up after himself because the kids destroy the house enough. A couple times a week he\u2019ll help with dinner and cleanup at the end of the day as well. \n\nOver the last 2 months, he\u2019s completely stopped helping. He dumps his clothes on the laundry room floor, his half of the bedroom is a mess, he leaves cans and wrappers all over the living room and he\u2019s even stopped getting the kids up which has upset them as they love their mornings with dad. He\u2019s also been coming home hours later than usual. I\u2019ve been letting it slide as he seems very stressed out, but a few days ago he snapped at me for being a \u201cshitty wife\u201d for letting his clothes go unwashed. I reminded him that he always did his own laundry, and he hadn\u2019t asked me to do it (I\u2019ve been doing it I just hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet) He just grumbled and went to go watch TV. \n\nLast night I made chicken alfredo, we have it about once a week because the kids love it and no one\u2019s ever complained. Well, he bitched and moaned through the whole dinner. Said that since I\u2019m not taking care of the house I should at least put a good meal on the table, that I\u2019ve just been letting the whole family go to shit and I should be ashamed of myself for treating him and his children like that. Called me a bad wife and mother in front of our children. I told the children to go to their rooms and snapped, I screamed at him about how much I do for the household, that if it wasn\u2019t for me the place would be trashed and he has no right to treat me like this over chicken alfredo. We went back and forth for a while before he left, and I have no idea where he went and he isn\u2019t answering my calls or texts. \n\nI feel bad now, as I shouldn\u2019t have reacted like that, especially because I know he\u2019s just stressed from work, but it all just kind of built up and came out at once. I just want to know if I was wrong for freaking out on him like that.", "created_utc": 1679517489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yvtzr/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_over_chicken/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think a 60-80hr a week job is sustainable in the long run if you want a father and husband to be present. That schedule barely gives time for self care and sleep.

Then you have him getting the kids up and ready, himself ready, doing his own laundry, cleaning up parts of the house, and who knows what ypu haven't shared, probably yard work too. \n\nYou're both equally asses about the dinner blow up but you, OP, are putting a lot on him with work and housework. If it were equal between the two of you, the work hours and the house work, it would be different. But it's not. You have made the conscious choice to work part time while your kids are in school and not do the household tasks that generally fall on the SAHP.

Possibly an affair or something. I apologize if this will cause you to have thoughts that will make you miserable but think about it. To me it sounds like he\u2019s taking something out on you. I seriously doubt it\u2019s his work. If it was a simple \u201csorry babe works been rough on me as of late\u201d would suffice. But instead he\u2019s been an asshole for no fucking reason. Sounds like he\u2019s taking it out on you because he\u2019s guilty and he needs a reason to justify his actions. His justification is now that you don\u2019t do his clothes, you don\u2019t take care of the house, and that you can\u2019t put a decent meal on the table. He\u2019s detached at the moment and there\u2019s a reason. He\u2019s also not sharing this reason with you so an affair seems possible.\n\nAgain I\u2019d like to apologize if this makes you worry yourself but it makes sense to me.

Your husband is being a bit of a jerk and I get the feeling you may have been trying to give him some space initially and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that but definitely force a sit down or couples therapy. You need to clear the air.", ">or possibly having an affair.\n\nThat was what my mind went to. Being burnt out might lead to not wanting to do chores but lashing out about the alfredo made me feel like he was comparing her to someone else.", "Guess what I do for work, mate. Work a 60 hr a week, physically demanding job. Get real.", "To clarify, I meant with home duties.", "No that's not why. It's because your husband can handle that pressure of possibly be the primary earner. Now if he's not and you contribute evenly that may be the difference here.\n\nLet's remember this man is a human, who's working 80 hours a week. He's the primary earner in his home so he can't just say well ill quit and get a new job.  He's probably forcing himself to go everyday to make sure his family have a roof over their head and sadly he's hating it. But won't say anything. \n\nOP and her husband need to talk not have strangers tell her husband is cheating because it happened to them", "That\u2019s interesting I\u2019ve burned myself out and I usually feel angry or just shitty all the time. But yeah it\u2019s no excuse for sure.", "The kids are in school at least three days a week. So yes OP is doing hosuework but when doing that housework she deliberately skips what she considers his share of housework and wants him to do that when he gets home even though he is working 60-80 hours and probably longer now since she stated he's been coming home even later.\n\nKids can destroy a house in seconds but with them being in school mutliple days a week from probably 8-2:30 the house should be fairly easy to keep picked up from the children's mess", "I'm not arguing who works more or who works harder. I'm saying that it's not OP's money or her husband's money... It's THEIR money.", "Projecting much?", "The rare reddit comment with complete logic. \n\nI'm a fan of communication can solve just about anything, but he probably just doesn't have the bandwidth to communicate properly. If he's working consistent 80 hour weeks he's probably getting little sleep and is in a bad place mentally.", "That I agree on yelling is not how to solve problems but shit does it let you release all that pent up stuff. Op and husband should\u2019ve had a proper discussion before it blew out of proportion.", "So how would you like to add another 20 hours on top of that. But let me guess you actually work 85 hours outside in the snow and you walk to work and its uphill both ways. \n\nTaking care of a modern household isnt hard if you dont let things pile up. Give me 20 hours a week and ill show you a clean well kept home.", "They just both suck at communicating", "I\u2019m sorry but I disagree. It doesn\u2019t really matter what is going on in your life you do not look at your wife and say those things. It\u2019s verbal and emotional abuse. I understand that he\u2019s exhausted and stressed and he would be well with in his rights to tell his wife he needs help financially providing. But we are not excusing verbal and emotional abuse with \u201che\u2019s human\u201d and \u201che\u2019s providing\u201d. Absolutely not.", "[deleted]", "She works outside the home while the kids are in school, though.\n\nHis job is to do his own laundry and get the kids out the door, so that he can spend some time with them. She does everything else. \n\nI do not put \"throwing away your own trash\" down as a household chore, because that's something every member of the household who can walk and talk should do for themselves. I don't give a fuck how many hours you work, you put your trash in the bin. \n\nHe verbally abused her in front of the children because he was mad about dinner. That's what resulted in this conflict\u2014not her asking him to start helping out more, which is a thing *she didn't do* because she knows he's stressed.", "I\u2019m not the one who started this chain but \u201cyour\u201d can refer to more than one person. If you were only asking for clarification, why did you need six question marks?\n\nThe husband\u2019s behavior has changed in a way that is detrimental to the family. If OP hasn\u2019t been keeping an eye on the family\u2019s money before now then she needs to start. It\u2019s good advice.", "No. Just being practical.", "Agreed.", "It\u2019s very clear from your other comments you have a deep-seated hatred for women.", "I didn't excuse it. I gave a reason.  You claimed your husband doesn't do it because he loves ans respects you implying OP husband doesn't.   I'm saying people react to stress differently. I'm not saying that his behavior is acceptable but as a married couple it can be fixed. \n\nIt's like if SAHM feels overwhelmed with the kids and house work but never complains. Than one day snaps. Is her reaction wrong, absolutely.  But doesn't mean she doesn't love her husband or her kids. It means they're struggling and didn't know how to express it. \n\nLike to repeat hes wrong. I was responding to the original person saying her husband a cheater and to you saying her husband doesn't love her. I disagree with those two statements.  I agree his reaction is wrong.", "Are you saying in your life never witnessed someone be angry with other if their stressed with work, going through a break up, or dealing with a sick family member. \n\nPeople are human and react differently.  If you never met anyone who handled stress badly you been really blessed", "There's nothing \"practical\" about what you said. You made an assumption with zero evidence or implications from the OP that he's cheating or anything even remotely of the sort.", "Nah my mom just actually parented me so that she didn't need the equivalent of a full time job to pick up after me. My mom kept the house clean, I didnt mess it up, dad cooked dinner. My mom didnt want to have to work the longer hours and grueling work that my dad did. He was used as the example of why studying and getting a better job was necessary because it sucked doing what he had to.", "I hear you. It sounds like the husband has a lot going on and somethings got to give. The division of labor here isn\u2019t adding up. I would also like to add that he may not be working those hours because they need the money, it might just be the requirement of the job in which case it would be a choice. That\u2019s my husband\u2019s situation. \n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from I just don\u2019t want anyone walking away thinking that just because your partner is having a hard time they can be this way. It\u2019s not cool and that\u2019s like a text book DV excuse. But I recognize you never expressly excused his behavior it\u2019s just how I interpreted your comment.", "I get that and actually want to thank you.  I know we have different first opinions on this but it's rare someone actually step back and look at what someone is saying here. It's refreshing, I honestly wish you an amazing rest of your day"]}
