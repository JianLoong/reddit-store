I do the majority of the housework and childcare and I don\u2019t mind as I understand he has a hard job and works a lot. He gets the kids on the bus every morning because he leaves for work about 10 minutes afterward. All I ask of him is to do his laundry as his clothes are covered in oil and grime and need to go in by themselves and pick up after himself because the kids destroy the house enough. A couple times a week he\u2019ll help with dinner and cleanup at the end of the day as well. \n\nOver the last 2 months, he\u2019s completely stopped helping. He dumps his clothes on the laundry room floor, his half of the bedroom is a mess, he leaves cans and wrappers all over the living room and he\u2019s even stopped getting the kids up which has upset them as they love their mornings with dad. He\u2019s also been coming home hours later than usual. I\u2019ve been letting it slide as he seems very stressed out, but a few days ago he snapped at me for being a \u201cshitty wife\u201d for letting his clothes go unwashed. I reminded him that he always did his own laundry, and he hadn\u2019t asked me to do it (I\u2019ve been doing it I just hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet) He just grumbled and went to go watch TV. \n\nLast night I made chicken alfredo, we have it about once a week because the kids love it and no one\u2019s ever complained. Well, he bitched and moaned through the whole dinner. Said that since I\u2019m not taking care of the house I should at least put a good meal on the table, that I\u2019ve just been letting the whole family go to shit and I should be ashamed of myself for treating him and his children like that. Called me a bad wife and mother in front of our children. I told the children to go to their rooms and snapped, I screamed at him about how much I do for the household, that if it wasn\u2019t for me the place would be trashed and he has no right to treat me like this over chicken alfredo. We went back and forth for a while before he left, and I have no idea where he went and he isn\u2019t answering my calls or texts. \n\nI feel bad now, as I shouldn\u2019t have reacted like that, especially because I know he\u2019s just stressed from work, but it all just kind of built up and came out at once. I just want to know if I was wrong for freaking out on him like that.", "created_utc": 1679517489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yvtzr/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_over_chicken/", "score": 2675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it were equal between the two of you, the work hours and the house work, it would be different. But it's not.

Possibly an affair or something. I apologize if this will cause you to have thoughts that will make you miserable but think about it. To me it sounds like he\u2019s taking something out on you. I seriously doubt it\u2019s his work. If it was a simple \u201csorry babe works been rough on me as of late\u201d would suffice. But instead he\u2019s been an asshole for no fucking reason. Sounds like he\u2019s taking it out on you because he\u2019s guilty and he needs a reason to justify his actions. His justification is now that you don\u2019t do his clothes, you don\u2019t take care of the house, and that you can\u2019t put a decent meal on the table. He\u2019s detached at the moment and there\u2019s a reason. He\u2019s also not sharing this reason with you so an affair seems possible.\n\nAgain I\u2019d like to apologize if this makes you worry yourself but it makes sense to me.
