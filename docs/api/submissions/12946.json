I do the majority of the housework and childcare and I don\u2019t mind as I understand he has a hard job and works a lot. He gets the kids on the bus every morning because he leaves for work about 10 minutes afterward. All I ask of him is to do his laundry as his clothes are covered in oil and grime and need to go in by themselves and pick up after himself because the kids destroy the house enough. A couple times a week he\u2019ll help with dinner and cleanup at the end of the day as well. \n\nOver the last 2 months, he\u2019s completely stopped helping. He dumps his clothes on the laundry room floor, his half of the bedroom is a mess, he leaves cans and wrappers all over the living room and he\u2019s even stopped getting the kids up which has upset them as they love their mornings with dad. He\u2019s also been coming home hours later than usual. I\u2019ve been letting it slide as he seems very stressed out, but a few days ago he snapped at me for being a \u201cshitty wife\u201d for letting his clothes go unwashed. I reminded him that he always did his own laundry, and he hadn\u2019t asked me to do it (I\u2019ve been doing it I just hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet) He just grumbled and went to go watch TV. \n\nLast night I made chicken alfredo, we have it about once a week because the kids love it and no one\u2019s ever complained. Well, he bitched and moaned through the whole dinner. Said that since I\u2019m not taking care of the house I should at least put a good meal on the table, that I\u2019ve just been letting the whole family go to shit and I should be ashamed of myself for treating him and his children like that. Called me a bad wife and mother in front of our children. I told the children to go to their rooms and snapped, I screamed at him about how much I do for the household, that if it wasn\u2019t for me the place would be trashed and he has no right to treat me like this over chicken alfredo. We went back and forth for a while before he left, and I have no idea where he went and he isn\u2019t answering my calls or texts. \n\nI feel bad now, as I shouldn\u2019t have reacted like that, especially because I know he\u2019s just stressed from work, but it all just kind of built up and came out at once. I just want to know if I was wrong for freaking out on him like that.", "created_utc": 1679517489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yvtzr/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_over_chicken/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it were equal between the two of you, the work hours and the house work, it would be different. But it's not.

Possibly an affair or something. I apologize if this will cause you to have thoughts that will make you miserable but think about it. To me it sounds like he\u2019s taking something out on you. I seriously doubt it\u2019s his work. If it was a simple \u201csorry babe works been rough on me as of late\u201d would suffice. But instead he\u2019s been an asshole for no fucking reason. Sounds like he\u2019s taking it out on you because he\u2019s guilty and he needs a reason to justify his actions. His justification is now that you don\u2019t do his clothes, you don\u2019t take care of the house, and that you can\u2019t put a decent meal on the table. He\u2019s detached at the moment and there\u2019s a reason. He\u2019s also not sharing this reason with you so an affair seems possible.\n\nAgain I\u2019d like to apologize if this makes you worry yourself but it makes sense to me.

Like I knew it was still me and those actions (or lack thereof) would come back and bite me, but I felt like I was watching myself. I just assumed I was bored at my job until I was telling my therapist about it and she was like \u201cmy friend. That is called burnout.\u201d The human brain is weird.", ">Lol we is not a correct statement. I have headaches virtually every day while it may be stress, dehydration, or lack of sleep I can be an ass to my gf at times and say something in a snappy manner but it takes about a minute or two for me to feel guilt and realize I was unjustified.\n\n\nAnd that's great. You know that headaches are an issue for you, so you can spot the problem pretty quickly.\n\n\nBut when you have a new problem, that you don't yet realise is bothering you and then some minor issue presents itself it's pretty easy to snap at the little problem and spend hours overreacting to that same detail without seeing the underlying issue.\n\n\n\nHe's almost certainly sleep deprived. He's clearly struggling to stay organised (hence him falling behind on his laundry). Someone has left his work place adding more work to his pile. Odds are there's one huge problem at work that got added to that pile recently and the weight of it all is bubbling to the surface.", "I think most people would agree his anger mostly likely comes from the stress of working 80 hours a week for 8 years.  \n\nSo outside OP working more hours so her husband can work less hours what other options would there be outside of him sucking it up?", "Lots of people have separate finances.", "OP says in another comment they keep separate financial accounts, then have a joint account they move money into for bills/household expenses. Before anyone jumps on this, it's not unheard of for couples to arrange their finances this way.", "On the paystubs point, my company hires a different company. I have to do a few steps to get them and it\u2019s all connected to my work credentials. So giving someone else access is not always easy. The bank account is a whole separate issue - red flags all over", "Some couples have separate accounts with one joint account for the bills", "I\u2019ve experienced that sensation as well, a numbness and just doing things you do. Scrolling through your phone mindlessly, sitting at my desk for hours not doing anything, or just driving to work and all of a sudden I\u2019m at my job but I don\u2019t remember the drive. Shits scary.\n(Or they could be different symptoms for other things at this point who tf knows)", ">d can work less hours what other options would there be outside of him sucking it up?\n\nI don't know, Im not involved in their finances. perhaps a job change or changed car situation- this is an AITA for one specific instance, and OP is NTA but her husband is. a lot of people are overworked or otherwise suffering and aren't assholes to the people around them. (and OPs non-paid domestic work is still work)\n\nI agree overwork is a problem and they should look for a change,  but a reason for anger is no excuse on verbally abusing your spouse in front of your kids.\n\nand OP has tried (possibly poorly) to find out what's wrong but has gotten no real response - capitalism is an asshole but so is OPs husband.\n\nedited typo", "To me that's the only smart way to do it. I 10000% trust my husband but why all the sudden would we need a sole joint acct? Seems unnecessary so idk why everyone is saying that's a red flag?\n\nBut it is quite sus OP that he did such a hard 180\u00b0 and the disparaging comments.", "This is how I experience burnout. Unfortunately,  when left untreated,  it turns into full-blown panic attacks and increased severity of the episodes of my costo(chondritis).\n\nI had two small ones, a husband who wasn't an equal partner and a job that made me miserable. It took a month of panic attacks in the parking lot to decide to find a new job. Found one, and I love it. Or, I did. Now, I'm starting to notice the disconnect and the apathy to most everything - and it sucks because it's not just affecting my job. it's everything. \n\nI know it's time to figure out my sitch, or I'll be back to panic attacks soon, but it's so scary to look in this economy.", "I mean, it could be a brain tumor or early onset dementia /s", "Ok but my whole point wasn't defending the husband ls actions just giving a reason for it. \n\nJust like if OP was to snap one day because she feels child care is too much on her.  If she curses out her husband infront of her kids she would be wrong but there's a reason behind why she did it. \n\nWhile the reaction is wrong the feelings are valid. That's my point.", "This may be out of line considering I\u2019m no expert or knowledgeable on the subject but wouldn\u2019t it be good for you to not associate burn out to panic attacks? I think if you begin to associate them it\u2019ll bring them in a lot sooner since you very likely fear the panic attacks. I know I\u2019m not a fan of how helpless I felt when one of them hit me. But I hope you find treatment and hopefully a job you love.", "This is the most civil back and forth I\u2019ve seen on Reddit in a long time! Bravo to you and Top Practice!", "You're probably right. That's why I think I have to start getting serious about my job search before that happens. On the other hand, this job isn't even in the same league as my last in terms of burnout.  I'm just starting to feel the apathy, and I was hoping I'd have more time before I actually had to address it. (Hiding my head in the ground, essentially, and hoping it won't happen)\n\nThank you for the advice! I will try it."]}
