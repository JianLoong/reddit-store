I do the majority of the housework and childcare and I don\u2019t mind as I understand he has a hard job and works a lot. He gets the kids on the bus every morning because he leaves for work about 10 minutes afterward. All I ask of him is to do his laundry as his clothes are covered in oil and grime and need to go in by themselves and pick up after himself because the kids destroy the house enough. A couple times a week he\u2019ll help with dinner and cleanup at the end of the day as well. \n\nOver the last 2 months, he\u2019s completely stopped helping. He dumps his clothes on the laundry room floor, his half of the bedroom is a mess, he leaves cans and wrappers all over the living room and he\u2019s even stopped getting the kids up which has upset them as they love their mornings with dad. He\u2019s also been coming home hours later than usual. I\u2019ve been letting it slide as he seems very stressed out, but a few days ago he snapped at me for being a \u201cshitty wife\u201d for letting his clothes go unwashed. I reminded him that he always did his own laundry, and he hadn\u2019t asked me to do it (I\u2019ve been doing it I just hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet) He just grumbled and went to go watch TV. \n\nLast night I made chicken alfredo, we have it about once a week because the kids love it and no one\u2019s ever complained. Well, he bitched and moaned through the whole dinner. Said that since I\u2019m not taking care of the house I should at least put a good meal on the table, that I\u2019ve just been letting the whole family go to shit and I should be ashamed of myself for treating him and his children like that. Called me a bad wife and mother in front of our children. I told the children to go to their rooms and snapped, I screamed at him about how much I do for the household, that if it wasn\u2019t for me the place would be trashed and he has no right to treat me like this over chicken alfredo. We went back and forth for a while before he left, and I have no idea where he went and he isn\u2019t answering my calls or texts. \n\nI feel bad now, as I shouldn\u2019t have reacted like that, especially because I know he\u2019s just stressed from work, but it all just kind of built up and came out at once. I just want to know if I was wrong for freaking out on him like that.", "created_utc": 1679517489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yvtzr/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_over_chicken/", "score": 4864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it were equal between the two of you, the work hours and the house work, it would be different. But it's not.

Possibly an affair or something. I apologize if this will cause you to have thoughts that will make you miserable but think about it. To me it sounds like he\u2019s taking something out on you. I seriously doubt it\u2019s his work. If it was a simple \u201csorry babe works been rough on me as of late\u201d would suffice. But instead he\u2019s been an asshole for no fucking reason. Sounds like he\u2019s taking it out on you because he\u2019s guilty and he needs a reason to justify his actions. His justification is now that you don\u2019t do his clothes, you don\u2019t take care of the house, and that you can\u2019t put a decent meal on the table. He\u2019s detached at the moment and there\u2019s a reason. He\u2019s also not sharing this reason with you so an affair seems possible.\n\nAgain I\u2019d like to apologize if this makes you worry yourself but it makes sense to me.

Lying like that, to the people who house and feed you, who provide you with every/any opportunity they can...", "And giving head everyday on lunch break on top of that?!", "I don't think I could even manage *once* every single day. Don't get me wrong, it's fun - but sometimes you're just too tired, ya know?", "And don\u2019t forget the cheeky lunch time blowie!", "she already works more than 80 hours a week if she is working 3 days a week \\*and\\* doing  80% of the housework and nearly all the childcare", "But OP is already responsible for 3 young kids, a household and 3 days a week work. She's working 80 hours at least as well. Lots of women do when you count unpaid domestic labor.", "In an urn on the dresser, huh? You are quite possibly the coolest person on Reddit. Maximum respect to you.", "Payed is a nautical term.", "Some people can drink every day and be fine, others can't. Drugs affect everyone differently", "I wasn't referring to weed, my brother was a crack/heroin addict", "Hell, masturbating once a day is exhausting.", "This is a partial comment copied form u/photogypsy  below.  This  account  is  likely  a bot.", "I can drink/smoke anyone to the point where they're questioning reality, and I'm fully cognizant, coherent and comfortable.\n\nThe thing is, there's NO WAY that cannabis rewards ANY adult with a modicum of tolerance enough that it makes sense for them to burn bridges with their parents.\n\nThat's addiction, though... I guess.", "I know, that was my point.\n\nHow does mid-20s adult commit such betrayals just for weed?\n\nA high-school kid, maybe... But an adult?\n\nLike, you literally do not get 'stoned' or 'high' once your tolerance hits a certain point. There's no way a person who is 'addicted' to weed isn't at that point.\n\nI'm convinced he was stealing to buy more than just weed...\n\nOtherwise, it just doesn't make sense.\n\n(also, sorry about your bro... Addiction is as serious a mental illness as there is)", "No matter your degree, if it takes 12 years to get it, and you aren't finishing with a fucking PHD... It's a mistake.\n\nIt literally doesn't make sense.\n\nI have an Associates and it took me 2 years to get it PART-TIME.\n\nI have friends who drive forklifts for a living. Getting their cert costed way less money than my degree, and took months, instead of the years I wasted on my degree.\n\nThey earning nearly six-figures.\n\nI'm treading the poverty line", "I dated a guy like that who got progressively crazier with accusations until I was \u201crunning a drug ring out of his house with his father who I\u2019d known longer than I\u2019d known him\u201d (all from his imagination) and had \u201cconspired with my ex-husband I\u2019d been divorced from for 7 years before we met to one day meet him online in a chat room so I could ruin his life\u201d (also his imagination), among other things. I believe he is schizophrenic, as it runs in the family and he showed all the signs his grandfather had shown. He became increasingly violent and less empathetic as time went on. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you got away from that. Mentally ill or not, people like that are scary and you don\u2019t deserve it.", "Ohhh I didn't realize that's what you were trying to say. Idk. I know weed isn't technically addictive per a physical sense, but I can imagine the physiological part could be a monster all on its own. But yeah, all that lying for weed doesn't seem normal", ">...but also if the worst happens I can still pay the rent and utilities from hubby's account if I need to since he takes care of the big payments cause he is the main house income.\n\nI hope you never need this information (or at least won't for many, many years), but it's SUPER important to fill out some paperwork at the bank. \n\nAt least in the US, after someone dies, you can *not* use their accounts (the bank will freeze them once they find out about their death), unless you are named as a joint signer on the account. If it's not a joint account, you can get access if you're the payable-on-death beneficiary, but *only after probate is complete*.", "Oh ya, my ex-husband was probably bipolar. his step-mom was always breaking into the house and moving his stuff around and smoking his weed. pretty sure that last one was a lie to pretend that he wasn't smoking a shit ton of weed. like dumping his adhd meds (I don't think he had adhd) down the toilet when it started to get out of hand... pretty sure the toilet was his mouth. he was out from abusing it.", "We do have a joint account as well so if he is on life support or any accident really, I just need his phone to transfer into that account straight away and then if he does pass I still have access. (We mainly use the joint account for passing money anyway)"]}
