I had said for about a month that there was this one specific show I wanted to go to, that happened on my birthday in our city. She knew I wanted to go to this show, and she said that because it\u2019s my birthday, she would buy the tickets.\n\nOn the night before my birthday, I asked her \u201chey, what row are we for tomorrow?\u201d And she said \u201coh shit I haven\u2019t booked them yet\u201d. She immediately pulled out her phone and a few minutes later, sheepishly told me \u201cit looks like they\u2019re sold out. I\u2019ll call them tomorrow and see what I can do\u201d. Then she rolled away from me and her was silent until she fell asleep.\n\nWe have a tradition of getting up early to decorating the house for each other\u2019s birthdays before they wake up. It\u2019s cheesy, since it\u2019s just the two of us, but it\u2019s sweet and I\u2019ve come to look forward to giving and receiving it. Well, tomorrow comes and I wake up at 9:00 (she knew I\u2019d be getting up then) to find her sound asleep next to me. More than an hour later, she gets up. She says \u201coh noooo I woke up so late I didn\u2019t mean to get up so late\u201d. (She\u2019s a chronic over sleeper). I\u2019m doing yoga in the living room while she blows up like 5 balloons and sticks a few sad pieces of crepe paper on the ceiling. It felt so embarrassing and stupid to be there while she hurried around sheepishly putting up the saddest birthday decorations I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nI went out to get some McDonald\u2019s breakfast for us, then I ask her if she was able to get our tickets. She said \u201cI called them but they were really rude to me\u201d. Then she went out to go buy a cake for me. While she was out, i guess she also booked tickets for a different show. She didn\u2019t ask me, and this new show didn\u2019t have the one thing that made me pick the original show to begin with (which she knew).\n\nWell, we go to the show she picked, and she spends the whole ride there talking about how it\u2019s actually better than the one I picked. She also booked herself a trip with \u201cthe homies\u201d that left the following day. She was pretty quiet the whole event. When I asked her what was wrong, she said she was stressed about her vacation trip the next day.\n\nWhen we get home, she gives me my gifts. I love a nice gift, and so I did truly appreciate them. If there was anything that disappointed me, it was that they were all off my Amazon cart (not even a wishlist, she actually just took my phone 3 days before my bday and looked through my Amazon app). But, they were all things I wanted (obviously) and I appreciated that, through her, I now had them.\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s been a couple weeks now and I kinda can\u2019t stop thinking about what an awful birthday I had. I just felt like a last thought.\n\nSo since I haven\u2019t gotten over it, I figure I should either GET over it, or bring it up with her. That\u2019s why I posted.

It\u2019s not productive. Tell her how you felt and still feel rather than making an accusation. \u201cYou ruined my birthday\u201d is inflammatory and unlikely to lead to a positive resolution. \u201cI felt sad and unimportant on my birthday because everything felt like an afterthought\u201d is far more conducive to a productive conversation. You have a legitimate grievance, and you should express it, but you should be mindful of how you do it.", "The way I read this is that it's been two weeks, you are still feeling negative emotions about the situation which you are struggling to deal with or find a place for. Your missus let your down, you still love her but it feels like she should have at least recognised that you weren't a happy bunny so here you are not knowing which way to go.\n\nIf there is a precedent in your relationship (an unwritten agreement) to do each other lavish colorful birthdays & this is your thing then subconsciously the negative emotions you are feeling may be bigger than just a birthday. perhaps you are questioning your entire relationship and the reasons behind the lack of enthusiasm and planning.\n\nI think in this instance I would say that you are not the asshole because the expectation has already been set & so your feelings and emotions about the situation are perhaps your inner protection mechanisms churning away trying to understand what happened and why & if this is still a relationship you can safely attach in.\n\nI think you need to acknowledge that there is an issue, have a chat with the missus and hopefully the two of you can hammer it out and resolve the problem.", "NTA - You act like she cares if she ruined your birthday. You are looking for her to show real regret and she hasn\u2019t done so for weeks. You are ignoring the bigger issue.\n\nDoes she have a habit of being this thoughtless and sorry after the fact? It sounds like she does and you\u2019ve either ignored it or nagged her about it. I suggest you seriously consider if you\u2019re more invested in this relationship than she is.", "NTA. Talk to her, but its more like you\u2019re  disappointed and hurt. Not that she ruined your birthday. Tell her that how her lack of preparation comes across to you. You spent time telling her the specific show you wanted to see. The fact she didn\u2019t set a reminder or put tickets in a cart shows that she either thought \u201cehh I can do that later\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal, tickets will be there\u201d.  \n\nTell her the fact she could just move on after saying \u201che was rude to me, and still sold out/ so I picked something\u201d showed she thought \u201cthis is just as good, because I think it is/ convince you\u201d. The person was rude because she likely was annoyed and short with them on the phone OR she\u2019s one of many people calling trying to \u201csee what they could do\u201d believing that there\u2019s some tickets being held for special call-ins\u2026\n\nShe overslept, does she not have an alarm? Tell her that you felt hurt that she didn\u2019t try to do something to ensure she\u2019d get up early OR knowing she oversleeps stay up the night before.  She rushed around and you felt that the effort was \u201cthis will be fine\u201d. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019d rather her take ownership and apologize for how things turned out. You\u2019d prefer \u201cbabe, I\u2019m sorry. I know you wanted to see the show and I forgot. I know you have been excited to see it and I dropped the ball. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t wake earlier because I overslept. I could\u2019ve decorated last night but I thought I\u2019d be fine and wake up. This new show doesn\u2019t make up for the other one, but I wanted to do something for you on your birthday. Let\u2019s plan something, I\u2019ll look into more dates for the show. We may be acme to turn it into a weekend trip for and do a mini getaway for the show.\u201d\n\nTell her how you understand she was trying to fix things and make the best of each instance but it felt like she was just putting a band-aid on it and not getting why your were hurt.\n\nShe may feel hurt too. You didn\u2019t see all the good she was trying to do and still make your day special. Y\u2019all should talk about this.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I know disappointing birthdays. My family once threw me a surprise party. But they thought it\u2019s be best if everyone went about there day as if it was t my birthday. No traditions: waking the birthday person with singing \u201chappy birthday\u201d, no picking family dinner and no choosing fun family activity for the weekend. They thought it\u2019d make the surprise that much better, but it hurt me and when the time came for convincing me to dress nice and go with them, I had been my room crying.  They were shocked and kept trying to convince me but I was angry. I got dressed and was upset. The party was nice but I couldn\u2019t just turn off the hurt. Later, I told them how their actions appeared to me. That their planning didn\u2019t consider the emotions of \u201cthey don\u2019t care/ how did they forget\u201d because nothing was acknowledged. They were hurt but were able to see it from my perspective. Because \u201cof course we wouldn\u2019t forget\u201d changed quickly when I asked them to imagine that it was their birthday; so excited & going to sleep early. Only to feel ignored all day. \n\n\nTalk with her", "NTA\n\nI read the other post you made about your relationship, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much to say other than, ending a relationship is never pleasant but it\u2019s better than being with someone who does not appreciate you and does not care about your wants and needs.", "Ntah. Sounds like girlfriend is done trying. I don't know if this is a one time thing but I would definitely talk with her", "I think you should bring it up and let her know how you feel keeping in is not gonna solve anything and I don\u2019t think she really cared enough to put in any effort for your birthday", "NTA. I would talk to her but leave out inflammatory statements. I would tell her how you feel (hurt, sad, neglected, questioning, etc.). Nothing will change until you communicate with her. It might not have been intentional but your gift and the whole day seemed like an afterthought instead of a priority.", "Just think of it like this: you may not have gotten everything you wanted, but she did put some effort in, even if it was just looking at your Amazon shopping cart.", "Oof, NTA\n\nBut sounds like she hadnt really prepared herself. Being a oversleeper, i could let slide. Forgetting the tickets kinda pushes it. Waking up and speedrunning decorations because she woke up late sounds like someone who realized they f'd up, i can see shes trying to make up for it.\n\nThat being said, i'd let it slide. Telling her she ruined your birthday while she really was doing her best to manage the day could spark a argument. Also, i personally find the older you get, the less important birthdays really become.", "Not the right woman for you OP, I think you\u2019re harping on this because somewhere deep down you know this.

Hoping is one thing, expecting and getting pissed when you didn't get a gift you assumed you'd get.... Entitled brat.   I don't blame her for needing a trip with the homies.", "Your GF seems like she was unprepared, which sucks, but your attitude about everything seems very focused on the material stuff you were expecting. When things didn't go perfectly, you figured your birthday was \"ruined.\"\n\nNo. Your birthday was not ruined. You know what actually ruins birthdays? Sudden deaths in the family, or breakups, or huge fights, or your partner going to jail, and stuff like that. Your birthday might not have been the greatest one, but it was far from \"ruined.\"\n\nGet some perspective and appreciate the fact that you woke up next to someone who loves you (probably), you're both healthy, you spent time together, you got cake, etc...\n\nESH", "You didn't have a perfect birthday, get over it.", "YWBTA if you put it like that. You two obviously don't talk with each other about anything, you just think the other one will read your mind. Once you start talking to each other things will get clarified.", "Yta.
