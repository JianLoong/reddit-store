We believe maintaining a relationship with our grandchildren take priority over our son, he is an adult.\n\nFast forward several years and my son marries the lady he was seeing (F, 34). A couple of years later, they have a child. We send presents (Christmas, birthday), but have not invited them to family events. It has been 16 years that we\u2019ve had his ex as part of our family and we don\u2019t want to change that or make it awkward. My wife and I want a relationship with our new grandchild, of course.

We aren\u2019t interested in having separate family gatherings at holidays, nor are we interested in having our son dictate who we invite. My son and his wife say our decision hurts them, but they won\u2019t change their position either. They have asked us not to contact them, so they couldn't be invited now anyway.

You chose to exclude *your son* from *family* gatherings because you like your ex DIL and don't like your son...it's just that simple.  There was no reason not to include your son and his girlfriend from holidays, you just wanted to make the point that he was not welcome.   And you've been sticking it to him for **sixteen years**.

After a few months, they were married and pregnant with a child.\n\nShortly before their 3 year anniversary, my son separated from his ex. We learned a few months later that he was dating again. The divorce took several years to finalize, and we kept close with my son\u2019s ex. We had her and her children (she has an older child from a previous marriage) over for family events (Easter, Christmas, birthdays, just hanging out). We did not invite our son and his girlfriend. We believe maintaining a relationship with our grandchildren take priority over our son, he is an adult.\n\nFast forward several years and my son marries the lady he was seeing (F, 34). A couple of years later, they have a child. We send presents (Christmas, birthday), but have not invited them to family events. It has been 16 years that we\u2019ve had his ex as part of our family and we don\u2019t want to change that or make it awkward. My wife and I want a relationship with our new grandchild, of course. But our son and his wife insist that we need to invite them first, and ask his permission to invite his ex. We aren\u2019t interested in having separate family gatherings at holidays, nor are we interested in having our son dictate who we invite. My son and his wife say our decision hurts them, but they won\u2019t change their position either. They have asked us not to contact them, so they couldn't be invited now anyway. I feel like my son and his wife are the AH, but they seem to think my wife and I are the AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
