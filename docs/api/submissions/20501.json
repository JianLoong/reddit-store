I'd like it to be known that my room doesn't smell of piss (I make my boyfriend come in and check - I'm so self conscious about it). Little brother leaks and doesn't scrub his mattress particularly well. I do it sometimes but I think our parents are so used to it they don't often think to help him out with it.\n\nSister I don't even know. She won't have a mattress protector because it crinkles and so I think her mattress just needs replacing, but our parents won't replace it.\n\nI do think her friends were exaggerating a little.

I had a similar problem growing up, due to some involuntary bladder issues that I won\u2019t go into detail about. Let\u2019s just say it took my body and my brain longer than that of the average developing person to learn how to control it. I don\u2019t know how it affects this family or what may be the exact cause in their case, but usually it tends to be like any other developmental delay that a person will eventually and naturally grow out of. It just takes longer. For me, it was around 12 or 13 years old. For others it may be a longer or shorter amount of time.", "I'm just about stopping I think. Like a couple times a week now.

She just picks on our brother because he won't stand up for himself.\n\nShe has always been a little mean to him, though.", "Yes.", "They make adult incontinence pads/underwear. Some period panties can also hold a lot of liquid, are reusable/eco-friendly, comfyand look like regular underwear. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s reusable incontinence underwear.

I don't know if he's right, but he might be.\n\nI don't know if she would have apologised, just changed the subject, but continued to let them think he was the reason for the smell.", "> have CPS at the door. \n\nNo. They wouldn\u2019t respond to just the house smelling of piss, if there were actual signs of neglect or abuse they would respond. Also CPS have such a huge work load that they\u2019ve dropped the ball in serious cases. \n\nI guarantee your family are \u201cnose blind\u201d to the smell.", "Very informative thank you!", "Yes absolutely. I've pondered getting some to sleep in myself overnight for periods", "I\u2019d be inclined to agree with your bf. Families normalize things, your parents\u2019 unusual attitudes about bed wetting could\u2019ve impacted that stage of your development and now you don\u2019t respond as strongly to signals you need to wake up to use the bathroom. Counseling/therapy can benefit anyone.", "I was referencing if I went to school smelling of pee. CPS comes then. I used to skip my shower in the morning in lieu of more sleep & CPS showed up bc my teachers said I smelt of pee.", "You can order different brands/styles online to find what\u2019s best for you.", "The weirdest part to me is they say it was a family thing, they get it from dad, but apparently mom had it too?

Family thing, as in, genetic. From our dads family.", "I was like, 8. I promise I shower now lol.", "Sorry I misread one of your replies, but yea I agree with other guy, this seems like a therapy thing.\n\nYou also admitted to blaming it on your brother in the past, and now your sister is doing it. Still cruel on both of you. It's really not normal to do that to a younger brother, who I guarantee will remember it.\n\nJust saying, he came to you hurt because of what sister did, did you even consider how much it would hurt him if he knew you did the same at one point?", "In my defense he was like, three, when I did it. And like, toddlers are allowed to pee the bed. Basically in their job description. I did plan on telling her he was too old to blame now.\n\nTypically if someone comments on it, that doesn't already know, I tell them its the cats. They usually can't tell the difference between cat piss and kid piss lol.", "The people who suck here the most are your parents. You all are far too old to be wetting the bed.

Just like she can be bullied so can the brother wtf . Now she know next time to keep her mouth close . And those aren\u2019t real friends if they ran to school and told her business . \n\nNTA , and I hope y\u2019all get help and figure out what\u2019s going on", "ESH. Your parents should not just be brushing this off. They are responsible for making sure the home is safe. I understand it would get old after a while but making sure mattresses/beds do not reek of urine is something they should be helping with. This is more than just a social issue, but a sanitary one. Also the fact that they won\u2019t buy her a new mattress is disgusting. Who wants to sleep in their own pee? She should not be punished for something she cannot control.", "NTA. She knows better than to humiliate someone else to make herself look better", "ESH\n\nThanks to your sister, it's possible that your brother will be bullied next year and thanks to you your sister will very likely be bullied next year. That being said, she shouldn't dish it if she can't take it.\n\nThey make mattress protectors that don't crinkle anymore. In addition, I don't know if you use disposable incontinence underwear or reusable ones. They make panties that are reusable for incontinence (much like period panties). Sadly, I don't know if they make boxer briefs or not. I know they make boyshort ones, so I would image there are some others like that somewhere.", "YTA. Your bro has his own friends that he didn't just become embarrassed around. Your sister is gonna have a tougher time.", "I disagree. She was fine with telling her catty friends about her brother and letting them laugh at him. She got what she deserved. OP was not bullying anyone, she merely stated a fact.

There are plenty now that don't crinkle.", "Have you been checked for sleep apnea? Sleep apnea will cause bed wetting and can be hereditary.", "Thinx has a line in particular for bladder leaks. The sister might be able to use those.", "Right? I didn\u2019t want to ask because it\u2019s not our business or relevant, but I\u2019d have thought they\u2019d mention I\u2019d it was medical. All they said was \u201cit\u2019s weird.\u201d \n\nDefinitely something to check out.", "Yup! No sleep apnea.", "There\u2019s medication to help with it DDaVP, and the use of night pads. Your family out to use them.", "Forgive me and please disregard if advice is not wanted.  You may want to look into constipation as the cause of your family's issues.

She was ridiculing her brother, violating his privacy, and letting her friends laugh at him. It will be a hard lesson but I hope she learned it well.", "ESH. I understand that you wanted to stick up for your brother. But you should have done that away from her friends.", "Is this a kink? This is the second or third \u201cfamily of bed wetters\u201d story I\u2019ve seen this month.", "And most of all\u2026. the parents for allowing things to just get to the point where things are smelly enough for company to notice (eg 8 year old going to school smelling so strong of pee CPS gets called, teenager with a room strong enough it embarrasses her in front of her friends, etc)", "I've read before about this, it can be genetic and apparently there's medicine for it, but most people don't think to go to the doctors.", "I wet the bed as a kid. Sleepovers were so embarrassing. I finally went to a urologist in the 4th grade. They fixed the issue within a few months. I highly suggest you guys get a doctor to look at this because it\u2019s a medical problem and it\u2019s really treatable. Your life will improve so much.", "i was around 10, both me & my siblings. my mom was asking drs about it until my dad said that he'd wet the bed til he was 10-12, too. i figured out that every time i had a dream about using the bathroom, i wet the bed, so i trained myself to wake up when i was dreaming about peeing", "They work really well for that as well!
