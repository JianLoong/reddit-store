One of my sisters also lives in the same city as do my wife's parents. On Saturday my wife invited my mom, brother, and sister, and my wife's parents to a dinner/get together at our home, as our parents haven't seen each other since our son was born 6 years ago. I did not like the idea, but my wife was set on it.\n\nOur parents have never gotten along well. My in-laws are wealthy whereas my mom has always been poor and myself and my brother help support her now. At 51 my mom is also young compared to them (70+). In the past my in-laws have said some things about my mom that have upset me, but I\u2019ve tried to not let it bother me.\n\nThe night started badly when my wife asked my mom about her boyfriend and her dad started asking her questions about him. \"Why didn't she invite him? What's his job?\" But then getting more invasive and essentially implying single moms shouldn't date and making a suggestive remark about her kids having different dads. I was already irate at this point, but my wife was able to deflect the conversation.\n\nOver the course of the night, they continued to make negative remarks that were directed at my mom. Even when my MIL was congratulating my sister about getting into law school, she used it to backhand my mom by saying how impressive it was considering where she came from. MIL also kept trying to police how my mom interacted with my son. A couple of times she told my son off for how he was playing with my mom despite the fact I was right there if he needed disciplining.\n\nI could see my mom was getting upset and because she was staying with us, she couldn't even leave. I was able to talk to her privately and asked if she was alright, she said she was fine, but she seemed very distressed. My mom has a history of mental illness and has an anxiety disorder that often leads to her struggling in social situations. My mom silently went to our spare room without saying anything to anybody else.\n\nI decided to politely ask my in-laws to leave and explained to them that I wouldn't tolerate them speaking to my mom the way they had that night. My wife & FIL tried to talk to me about it, but I told them I didn't want to discuss it right now, I just wanted them to leave. I didn't want to talk because I was already very angry and didn't want to lose my temper. After they left my wife and I started arguing.\n\nShe tried to downplay how her parents were treating my mom and make it seem like I was reading too much into their words. She also argued that even if I wanted her parents to leave, I should have discussed it with her first (ignoring the fact I couldn't have done that without extracting her from a conversation with everyone) and I was disrespecting her by not getting her permission. She now thinks I'm treating her family badly when it was her parents that wouldn't stop disparaging my mom, and I know she noticed because she kept trying to intervene.

If your wife didn't think her parents were doing anything wrong, why was she changing the subject or direction of the conversation when they were insulting your mother?", "Oh my goodness NTA!! Your mom deserves respect just like anyone else and is as much apart of the family as your in laws. Like you said, your wife clearly saw how their comments were affecting your mom because she tried to deflect. It sounds like they've done this before, and you set a boundary that hopefully will stop it from continuing. I can understand why your wife might feel defensive of her parents, since they are her parents, but it is your household as much as it is hers. That is not ok to treat your mother like that, and she was clearly affected by the conversation since she isolated. \n\nHave you and your wife ever explicitly talked about how they treat your mom or the class differences? If she's been aware of this issue before, her response is surprising....", "NTA Absolutely not!!! Forget trying to spare your wife's or your in-laws feelings you should have thrown them out earlier. Your wife and her parents seemed to have forgotten that your Mom have feelings too. In the future keep your Mom and your wife's parents apart even if you have to stand up to your wife.", "NTA. You were right to stand up for your mother and ask your in-laws to leave when they were making derogatory comments towards her. It's understandable that you were angry and didn't want to discuss it at the time, and your wife should have been more supportive of you in that moment. It's not disrespectful to her family to address their hurtful behavior towards your own family member. Your wife should have taken your concerns seriously and been more understanding of your feelings. It's important for partners to have each other's backs in situations like this.", "Absolutely fair for you to defend your mother - the InLaws were being biased and mean. In effect, lording it over her.\n\nAs to how you asked them, there was no good way to tackle that. Whatever you did would have been wrong, simply because you were kicking them out.\n\nLet her calm down. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife knows she and her parents are wrong. That\u2019s why she kept trying to redirect conversation. Did she ask permission before deciding everyone was invited? It\u2019s your home too right. You said you didn\u2019t like the idea but she was set on it. So did she steamroll you into this was what was going to happen or did she unilaterally decide and just let you know the plan?\n\nRegardless, you stood up for your mom. They made enough comments that she left the get together. As already said, your wife knew it was bothering you and kept changing the conversation. I\u2019m guessing it was obvious to everyone that them being AHs was bothering you. \n\nUnfortunately AHs with money very rarely don\u2019t get their way and it seems your wife may be like her parents. You did nothing wrong asking them to leave and you didn\u2019t need her permission. She was aware but was willing to allow it to continue because it was her parents that were in the wrong. I have a feeling if it was your mom causing the issue she would have had no problem asking her to leave without your input.", "NTA\n\nYou had to do it to protect your mom.   \n\nYour wife not seeing the harm her parents were doing to your mom is disgusting.   Minimizing the pain they put her through is the same as agreeing with what they were saying . \n\nSnobs will never see that they're in the wrong.   They will always put others down in subtle and not so subtle ways and blame it on upbringing and class.   They're  blame your behavior on your upbringing by a single mother.   \n\nThey're cruel and callous and they raised their daughter to be the same way.", "NTA. Your wife DID noticed her parents being rude to your mom and changed the subject of the conversation.  She didn't bother to talk your IL's about the matter and let them continue in their obnoxious path against ypur mom, so it isn't like she didn't knew what was coming. I admire your patience in the situation, you were very polite with your IL's.", "NTA, they were horrible to your mother and deserved to be asked to leave. Your wife is the AH for putting your mom through her mother's asinine bs. Your MIL is beyond AH. She's an effing c~nt.", "NTA- Your in-laws sound elitist and horrible. Your wife should be taking your side, especially since she was deflecting their rude behavior.", "NTA and you really need to have a conversation with your wife about setting some boundaries because her parents can\u2019t continue to treat your mother like this", "NTA.  That is your home as much as hers.  She needs to work with you to develop boundaries with her parents.  Definitely get a marriage counselor for you and your wife to discuss this matter.  She won't see how damaging this is to your marriage until she is therapeutically confronted.", "NTA.\n\nBut I do see why your wife felt disrespected. That's her house and her family.\n\nIf something like that ever occurs again, it's perfectly reasonable to say \"Babe, I need to speak with you privately for a moment.\" And have the conversation. \n\nOn a petty note - start doing it back to her parents whenever they start behaving like assholes.", "NTA, but that is not how I would have handled it.  Your mom was already in her room, the damage was done.  I would have rode out the evening, then had a frank discussion with your wife about them.  But NTA.", "This is a tough one because you did everything right but talk to your wife first (you could easily have called her aside.)\n\nI can see why that bothered her and why she feels disrespected.  \n\nWish I could give you the N T A.

I\u2019m sure this will be downvoted, but I suspect that we are only hearing one side of the story. However, that\u2019s the nature of this subreddit.  Obviously, the in-laws\u2019 passive aggressive insults were rude and disrespectful. That being said, I agree that a least a heads up should have been given to OP\u2019s wife. Imagine, if the next day, something happens bw the wife and OP\u2019s mother, and there\u2019s and argument or incident. How would OP feel if she makes the unilateral decision to kick his mother out of their house without at least giving him the heads up or discussing it with him?  OP\u2019s argument that he couldn\u2019t tell her because he would have to extract her from the conversation is a weak excuse.   A simple request to speak to her in private would have been an easy request and would have resulted in not her not being blindsided.", "Nta! Good of you to stick up for your mother", "NTA. Her parents were being butts, and your wife was fully aware of this fact. She needs to form a united front with you against this type of behaviour. It\u2019s not ok.

Your wife shouldn't have let her parents talk to your family like that.", "NTA. You do not need your wife\u2019s \u201cpermission\u201d to ask them to leave after they disrespected and insulted your mother. Clearly your wife is siding with her parents rather than with you. You did the right thing. Unfortunately some rich people are tactless and lack any sort of empathy and need to be humbled once in a while. The world is not their playground.", "NTA! What is wrong with your wife?  She is the biggest AH of all if she thinks her family's behavior was acceptable. \nShow her this post OP.", "Not at all.

They even sound like they  lack  self restraint and have no idea of minimum manners how to  act in company. So have to ask...

They needed to leave. She should have been the one to do it. She saw the way the were hurting your mother. She knew they were being rude and mean. She is wrong in this case.", "NTA. Is your wife making nice with her nasty parents because she knows she's going to inherit, or because she wants to inherit but doesn't know where she stands? That uncertainty is the only rational excuse for her suckup behavior, since she admits that her parents were in the wrong.", "There are so many ways to pull yourself out of a conversation; some excuse to talk to your wife . . OR made a statement and just ask to speak with her in private. The statement being made with \"Honey, I need to talk to you in private.\" would have been like a cracked whip to the conversation.   \nI agree that it would have been better to speak in private first with your wife . . BUT . .   \n\n\nThat said, NTA, there's a limit to how much anyone can take, and social nitpicking your mom into removing herself IS very Uncouth.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAsking them to leave after that much was likely the BEST thing to do, if they were that rude to her face, I'd hate to imagine what they would have been like when she was in another room.", "NTA, you're more even keeled than I. I'd have been fighting a geriatric man by nights end. You have a major issue with your in-laws because they're shitting on you too. You've also got an issue with your wife. There were so many red flags there it looks like a slalom course.", "NTA. You need to have an in depth conversation with her. Also, when it comes to who stays over in your house it's a two yes one no rule. You don't want in laws there then they need to go.", "NTA your wife is actually worse than your in laws because she didn\u2019t speak up and defend your mother when she was actually the one in the best position to do so being their daughter.", "Tell them to get the F out!!\n\nNTA", "NTA I am sick to death of people pandering to the people who will kick off and make a fuss if told their actions are unacceptable at the expense of people who are too nice to 'cause a scene' by objecting. Her parents did it precisely because they know if they're called out they can go ballistic and try to put everyone else in the wrong. People like that need to be publicly humiliated by having their actions called what they are, or they will carry on forever.", "another reason to despise wealthy ppl, they make me sick.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And get a divorce. Your wife seems to be just like her parents", "It's really time you and wife had some serious discussions about this, perhaps mediated by a therapist. You should both be both eager and anxious that crap like this never happens again in your home.", "Exactly. And they were treating her like this in front of 2 children,  teaching them that it's ok to speak too/about others this way. Teaching the 12 year old that he is less than is incredibly cruel. Teaching the 6 year old that he is more than is going to lead to a 3rd generation cruel and callous person or a very confused one as he is a mix of more/less than. OP is NTA and was protecting more than just his mom, in my opinion", "Also, the brother is supporting her. As in the literal 12 year old? WTH", "Most of these N T A comments sound like they come from teenagers with no actual life experience. like yes wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could tell everyone who you want to F off and get out of your house but in the real world, people have actual relationships and social interactions that need to be managed appropriately. Wife should\u2019ve had opportunity to be involved in how to address the situation. \n\nSame commenters who tell every OP to get a divorce for minor relationship conflicts and find a new job when they have a problem at work.", "I mean that\u2019s all well and good in concept but it isn\u2019t how adult social situations happen in reality is it? OP should have spoken to his wife, she may have preferred to ask them to leave directly and ultimately she is the one dealing with the fallout.", "It boils down to your wife being afraid to correct her parents, so she thinks it's easier to just argue with you to deflect. Make her face this or make it very clear that you will continue to remove her parents if they aren't capable of treating your family with respect.", "And your wife didn't stand up for her MIL at that time either?", "NTA. I had a similar experience with in laws and my husband always took their side.", "Actually, it could. Probably one of them leads the conversation that direction more eagerly, and I would suspect that one as being closer to dementia.", "YTA for not discussing things with your wife. It sounds like there may have been different ways to interpret what was going on. Her parents are probably annoying and insensitive, and you and your mother are sensitive about certain topics. Kicking her parents out just compounds the issues and is going to create more problems. Instead of coming at this like a bull in a china shop, you should have sought your wife\u2019s help in managing her parents. A show of strength/power was not needed here. You should have set boundaries with your wife and allowed her to set them with her own parents. You steamrollering in says you don\u2019t trust her to manage them. Respect your wife\u2019s relationship with her folks and give her an opportunity to defuse things, rather than escalating.", "I'm going to say something that we usually see on this Reddit when the poster is a woman. You don't have an Inlaw problem, you have a wife problem. Your wife and sat in the room with her parents and instead of policing them and telling them to stop she let them make backhanded, rude comments to your mother. That is never appropriate regardless of which set of in-laws is doing it. The first time her parents said something derogatory to your mother she should've stopped them sharply. You are NTA, but she is definitely TA.", "NTA next time (is there is a next time) say something immediately after they are rude. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a super rude thing to say\u201d call them out on it right on the spot. Good on you for sticking up for your mom. Your ILs are pieces of work", "NTA", "NTA, but your wife needs to support you on this", "Nta your wife and her parents sure are.", "NTA and not a good sign that your wife doesn't think her parents' behaviour merited intervention... like, if she can't set boundaries with her parents, she has some stuff to think about in terms of he relationship with them.", "NTA, your in-laws are bullies and your wife is an enabler. Knowing her parents she should never have asked your mum about her boyfriend during dinner. Your wife is probably in her parents' back pocket because of their wealth, period", "NTA, your wife is ridiculous for her reaction. You need no permission from no one to kick someone out that was hurting your mom. Also it's kind of hypocritical for her tk be mad at ylu for disrespectjng her family.", "You don\u2019t need your wife\u2019s permission when it\u2019s your house too, it seems she is defending her parents because she low key agrees with them about your mom. If I were you I\u2019d probably reanalyze your life with her and see what kind of person she is. NTA!", "NTA\n\nThey sound like really nasty people.  Sorry that you have to deal with this", "NTA, but you really should start calling your inlaws out on thier crappy behaivour and remarks the moment they spew it from their mouths. If you just wait and try to go about it \"nicely\" they'll fail to see what it is they did wrong and will continue with that kind of behaviour. Thinks of your inlaws as adult sized children in this situation. If your son had said something of the same sort, would you just wait a couple of hours and then when the victim has left, then you polietly tell your son those words weren't nice? I doubt it, you would have told them it was wring right then and there, or I should hope you do, so he can correct the behaviour quickly and hopefully learn from it. Likewise, do the same with the inlaws. It's about time they learned how to act like good adults in normal socitey. They're too old for playground/ high school bullying and need to grow up.", "Idiot", "I\u2019d threaten divorce honestly given her attitude", "Not only brave but smart - I can lose my temper too, and know how hard it can be to hold back and defer discussion until another time when my emotions are more in check. OP's mom (and the future of this in-law relationship) wouldn't have been well-served by a loud argument happening right at that moment. NTA", "He called the 12 year old his younger brother so I would assume he has another older brother. He also refers to his sister as one of his sisters. How many siblings does he have damn"]}
