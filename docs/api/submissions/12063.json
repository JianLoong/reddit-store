One of my sisters also lives in the same city as do my wife's parents. On Saturday my wife invited my mom, brother, and sister, and my wife's parents to a dinner/get together at our home, as our parents haven't seen each other since our son was born 6 years ago. I did not like the idea, but my wife was set on it.\n\nOur parents have never gotten along well. My in-laws are wealthy whereas my mom has always been poor and myself and my brother help support her now. At 51 my mom is also young compared to them (70+). In the past my in-laws have said some things about my mom that have upset me, but I\u2019ve tried to not let it bother me.\n\nThe night started badly when my wife asked my mom about her boyfriend and her dad started asking her questions about him. \"Why didn't she invite him? What's his job?\" But then getting more invasive and essentially implying single moms shouldn't date and making a suggestive remark about her kids having different dads. I was already irate at this point, but my wife was able to deflect the conversation.\n\nOver the course of the night, they continued to make negative remarks that were directed at my mom. Even when my MIL was congratulating my sister about getting into law school, she used it to backhand my mom by saying how impressive it was considering where she came from. MIL also kept trying to police how my mom interacted with my son. A couple of times she told my son off for how he was playing with my mom despite the fact I was right there if he needed disciplining.\n\nI could see my mom was getting upset and because she was staying with us, she couldn't even leave. I was able to talk to her privately and asked if she was alright, she said she was fine, but she seemed very distressed. My mom has a history of mental illness and has an anxiety disorder that often leads to her struggling in social situations. My mom silently went to our spare room without saying anything to anybody else.\n\nI decided to politely ask my in-laws to leave and explained to them that I wouldn't tolerate them speaking to my mom the way they had that night. My wife & FIL tried to talk to me about it, but I told them I didn't want to discuss it right now, I just wanted them to leave. I didn't want to talk because I was already very angry and didn't want to lose my temper. After they left my wife and I started arguing.\n\nShe tried to downplay how her parents were treating my mom and make it seem like I was reading too much into their words. She also argued that even if I wanted her parents to leave, I should have discussed it with her first (ignoring the fact I couldn't have done that without extracting her from a conversation with everyone) and I was disrespecting her by not getting her permission. She now thinks I'm treating her family badly when it was her parents that wouldn't stop disparaging my mom, and I know she noticed because she kept trying to intervene.

If your wife didn't think her parents were doing anything wrong, why was she changing the subject or direction of the conversation when they were insulting your mother?", "Oh my goodness NTA!! Your mom deserves respect just like anyone else and is as much apart of the family as your in laws. Like you said, your wife clearly saw how their comments were affecting your mom because she tried to deflect. It sounds like they've done this before, and you set a boundary that hopefully will stop it from continuing. I can understand why your wife might feel defensive of her parents, since they are her parents, but it is your household as much as it is hers. That is not ok to treat your mother like that, and she was clearly affected by the conversation since she isolated. \n\nHave you and your wife ever explicitly talked about how they treat your mom or the class differences? If she's been aware of this issue before, her response is surprising....", "NTA Absolutely not!!! Forget trying to spare your wife's or your in-laws feelings you should have thrown them out earlier. Your wife and her parents seemed to have forgotten that your Mom have feelings too. In the future keep your Mom and your wife's parents apart even if you have to stand up to your wife.", "NTA. You were right to stand up for your mother and ask your in-laws to leave when they were making derogatory comments towards her. It's understandable that you were angry and didn't want to discuss it at the time, and your wife should have been more supportive of you in that moment. It's not disrespectful to her family to address their hurtful behavior towards your own family member. Your wife should have taken your concerns seriously and been more understanding of your feelings. It's important for partners to have each other's backs in situations like this.", "Absolutely fair for you to defend your mother - the InLaws were being biased and mean. In effect, lording it over her.\n\nAs to how you asked them, there was no good way to tackle that. Whatever you did would have been wrong, simply because you were kicking them out.\n\nLet her calm down. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife knows she and her parents are wrong. That\u2019s why she kept trying to redirect conversation. Did she ask permission before deciding everyone was invited? It\u2019s your home too right. You said you didn\u2019t like the idea but she was set on it. So did she steamroll you into this was what was going to happen or did she unilaterally decide and just let you know the plan?\n\nRegardless, you stood up for your mom. They made enough comments that she left the get together. As already said, your wife knew it was bothering you and kept changing the conversation. I\u2019m guessing it was obvious to everyone that them being AHs was bothering you. \n\nUnfortunately AHs with money very rarely don\u2019t get their way and it seems your wife may be like her parents. You did nothing wrong asking them to leave and you didn\u2019t need her permission. She was aware but was willing to allow it to continue because it was her parents that were in the wrong. I have a feeling if it was your mom causing the issue she would have had no problem asking her to leave without your input.", "NTA\n\nYou had to do it to protect your mom.   \n\nYour wife not seeing the harm her parents were doing to your mom is disgusting.   Minimizing the pain they put her through is the same as agreeing with what they were saying . \n\nSnobs will never see that they're in the wrong.   They will always put others down in subtle and not so subtle ways and blame it on upbringing and class.   They're  blame your behavior on your upbringing by a single mother.   \n\nThey're cruel and callous and they raised their daughter to be the same way.", "NTA. Your wife DID noticed her parents being rude to your mom and changed the subject of the conversation.  She didn't bother to talk your IL's about the matter and let them continue in their obnoxious path against ypur mom, so it isn't like she didn't knew what was coming. I admire your patience in the situation, you were very polite with your IL's.", "NTA, they were horrible to your mother and deserved to be asked to leave. Your wife is the AH for putting your mom through her mother's asinine bs. Your MIL is beyond AH. She's an effing c~nt.", "NTA- Your in-laws sound elitist and horrible. Your wife should be taking your side, especially since she was deflecting their rude behavior.", "NTA and you really need to have a conversation with your wife about setting some boundaries because her parents can\u2019t continue to treat your mother like this", "NTA.  That is your home as much as hers.  She needs to work with you to develop boundaries with her parents.  Definitely get a marriage counselor for you and your wife to discuss this matter.  She won't see how damaging this is to your marriage until she is therapeutically confronted.", "NTA.\n\nBut I do see why your wife felt disrespected. That's her house and her family.\n\nIf something like that ever occurs again, it's perfectly reasonable to say \"Babe, I need to speak with you privately for a moment.\" And have the conversation. \n\nOn a petty note - start doing it back to her parents whenever they start behaving like assholes.", "NTA, but that is not how I would have handled it.  Your mom was already in her room, the damage was done.  I would have rode out the evening, then had a frank discussion with your wife about them.  But NTA.", "This is a tough one because you did everything right but talk to your wife first (you could easily have called her aside.)\n\nI can see why that bothered her and why she feels disrespected.  \n\nWish I could give you the N T A.   But ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Overall you still did the right thing.", "This!!! Came to say the same. \n\nThere is no need to deflect conversation if there is nothing wrong with what is being said. \n\nOp NTA, it would have been nice if you wife stood up to her parents too", "We've talked about class difference between us but never much in relation to our parents and how they interact.

Previously, they had been making comments about her while she wasn't present but I was.", "Funny how it didn\u2019t bother her to sit there and watch her parents be insulting towards her MIL.", "Yeah she sucks.
