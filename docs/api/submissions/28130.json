We\u2019ll call him Matt. We started dating when I was 16, and he has spent a lot of time with my family since then. Everyone in my family seems like to him and get along. Because of this, our families also know each other pretty well. We own a house and two cats together. Recently we\u2019ve been talking about getting engaged, and I am really excited about this.\n\n However, about a week ago my mom decided to let everyone at family dinner know that she has recently started dating Matt\u2019s father. Obviously, I was very upset and confused. She acted completely clueless as to why I was upset and said she thought I would be happy for her. I tried to explain to her that it was inappropriate and that this is wrong considering my relationship with Matt, and she said that she thought it was obvious that I would be expected to break up with him because it would inappropriate for us to interact like that when we \u201cbecome step siblings\u201d. I tried to communicate with her but she just kept saying it was a silly teenage romance and not as serious as her new \u201cadult relationship\u201d with his father so I should just let it go. After that remark, I couldn\u2019t take the frustration and I yelled at her that she was being entitled and selfish. Everyone saw the whole thing and were mad at me. I left and haven\u2019t spoken to her since, but apparently she\u2019s telling all my family members that I\u2019m being childish and immature and some of them seem to agree.\n\nI know that yelling probably wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it, but am I really the asshole in this situation? Me and my boyfriend both think that this is ridiculous and are standing firm about not breaking up, and I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole here, but she\u2019s acting so surprised by me being upset that it\u2019s making me think im missing something here. so, AITA for yelling at my mom?", "created_utc": 1696324746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yn0v6/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_because_she_wants_me/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your mother that her 'silly middle age romance' has nothing to do with you and then continue to live your life with Matt.  The fact that you own a home together indicates the maturity of your relationship.  Ignore her.", "NTA. *Damn*, your mom is moving fast -- they just started dating! And NO just because she thinks or wants or expects you and Matt to break up doesn't mean you actually have to. You are both adults, living in a home that you own together and are caring for two cats. Just because many people don't wind up with or marry their first loves, doesn't mean no one does, and you and Matt are clearly committed to each other. It's weird that she and your boyfriend's dad decided to date, but hey, if they want to tell people when they ask how they met that they met through their children who have been in a committed relationship for 4+ years than that's their choice and they are the ones that are going to get a raised eyebrow.", "NTA  \n\nI would have the same reaction if I was in your shoes. \n\nI can't understand how she says you should break with him just because she's RECENTLY dating his father, who is going to be your father-in-law. They are being unconsiderate to you and your soon-to-be-fiance.\n\nIt's weird they started dating now, knowing that you two were in a relationship. However, even if it's weird, I don't see any problem them dating because they don't share the same blood. But still, it's weird.", "Honestly, I don't see what the big deal is here. Yes it is weird for your mother to date you FIL but other then that I see no issue. Nobody needs to break up with anybody. \n\nStill, NTA mainly because your mother expects you to break up with your long-term bf. I would get mad at this too.", "Nta. Even if they will marry etc it doesn't make sense to end the relationship to Matt. But your mother sucks for dating Matt's father.", "NTA - Sounds like the plot of Gossip Girl", "ESH. Your initial reaction was inappropriate - assuming your mum and Matt's dad are both single, there's no reason they shouldn't date if they want to. It may feel a bit odd but there's nothing preventing them having a relationship and you and Matt having a relationship.\n\nHer assumption / expectation that you and Matt would break up is equally ridiculous. So much so that I have to wonder whether she was serious, or was saying it to point out how daft your own objection to her dating was.\n\nEither way, the obvious answer is that all 4 of you grow up and accept that you and Matt are n a relationship an that your mum and Matt's dad are now also in a relationship, and that as you are all adults and capable of making your own choices, there's nothing wrong with that and no one has to break up unless they want to.", "ESH your mother firstly because she has no place to expect or make you break up just because she\u2019s dating your boyfriends dad. \n\nHowever there is no way you\u2019d be like step siblings in the way that is gross or ethically questionable. You didn\u2019t grow up with each other raised in the same house, your relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend came about from outside the home. You also have no right to expect she can\u2019t date your boyfriends dad.\n\nBoth of you need to calm the farm down and not expect each other to break up. Your mother is more an AH than you for downplaying your relationship (though I get it bc you\u2019re both so young), I mean you both own a home together and in it for the long haul. Don\u2019t break up but remember as much as your mother is out of line to expect you to break up so are you for her.\n\nYou both clearly need to go LC right now and cool off.", "ESH. No one gets any say over other people's adult relationships - regardless of their age or how they know each other. You are entitled to date whomever you want - AS IS YOUR MOTHER.", "NTA/BTA...? Like 70% NTA, 30% BTA maybe?\n\nFirst up, no you're NTA for going off at your mum because she expects you would break off your relationship because of hers. You said this was a recent development, your mum dating you BF's dad so it's more than a bit presumptuous of her to decide her relationship is going the distance while yours won't.\n\nBeing step-siblings is as 'real' a relation as being inlaws. It's a social convention. Obviously context is important and not saying the step-siblings can't be just as close and have the same relationship as actual siblings but it doesn't make you and your BF actually related. If your mum and his dad are attracted to and care for each other cool, but it doesn't suddenly make you brother and sister.\n\nOn to the BTA take. Telling your mum it's inappropriate for her to date your BF's dad is a bit out of line. Just like them dating doesn't make you and your BF's relationship somehow incestuous, you two being in a relationship doesn't somehow make their relationship inappropriate. I get the gut reaction, it's not a situation you'd ever think you'd be confronted with but you are all adults.\n\nIf your mum is out of line for thinking your relationship is inappropriate you're out of line for thinking the same thing but her expectation that you'd end your relationship because of hers is what swings this one in your favour.", "Mild ESH - no one needs to break up with anyone, mom is fine to date whomever she chooses. Your response should have been, \"weird, but ok\", and thinking that if they break up, it will really poison the well for the two families getting together.\nBut your mom's position is hilarious. She's delusional and she deserves to be roundly ignored.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, she acted entitled and selfish, putting your engagement and your 4 years with your boyfriend down the drain like it never happened. You get a NTA for that. \n\nAs you said, you tried to engage communication with her and not only did she brush you off, but also fail to realize that you're a 20 y.o woman now, and not a teenager anymore. \n\nLeave her be if she's happy with your boy's dad, there won't be anything you can do about it and the same applies to her. She has no right to order you around over such things.\n\nI'd try one last time to mend bridges but is she or Matt's dad insists, talk with your boyfriend about going no-contact with them. \n\nDon't ruin your life over someone who expects things from you so she can be happy, rather for someone who expects you to be happy.", "Nta just elope an see what happens.", "What does you partner and his dad think about the situation", "NTA - Your mom is a bit messed up in the head girl, sorry. You absolutely do not have to break up with your boyfriend because of them. You seem like more of an adult than she is.", "ESH and immature. Your relationship has nothing to do with her and your BF's dad.\nThe dating doesn't make you siblings. There is nothing inappropriate in your parents dating.\nYou are with your BF for years and your mum is self entitled for even thinking that you should break up.\nAgain, her relationship with your BF's dad has nothing to do with you guys.\nIf neither of you can be an adult and see that then perhaps neither of you should be dating. You're obviously not ready. BTW, by neither of you I mean you and your mum!", "\"middle age\"????\n\nSounds more like a last gasp effort to me.", "I understand where everyone is coming from but I suppose it was a shock to me because if the roles were reversed I would have never even considered getting into a relationship with someone like that, I wouldn\u2019t want to cause her to be uncomfortable like that if she was dating him first. It just seemed like common sense to me so I was caught extremely off guard when she didn\u2019t even consider how it would affect me. However, after talking with Matt\u2019s dad, (my mom won\u2019t answer my texts so I\u2019ve had to communicate through him) he said that although he personally understands how weird of a situation this is, and despite us telling them we are willing to try to get used to this new arrangement, my mom is still making snide remarks about how once we come to our senses and see how inappropriate it is for \u201cstep siblings to be intimate\u201d, we better break up at some point over the next few years. If she does not get over it, I will be going no contact with my mom. Probably not with Matt\u2019s dad though", "I mean yeah any adult can date any adult but there are always ethical concerns.\n\n\nLike legally a 40 year old can date an 18 year old but that's creepy af\n\n\nIt's not 1 to 1 with this but like, there's millions of people in the world and the mom chooses the one person that would cause complications in her daughter's relationship? Like what if the bf is extremely uncomfortable with having his MIL also be his step-mom? And hell what if she becomes pregnant by his dad? The bf and the daughter would share a half-sibling \ud83e\udd22", "this actually makes me feel better than the NTA responses bc it shows me that I\u2019m right about this situation being so unreasonable, that you dont even believe it lol", "my boyfriend completely agrees with me, we both view it as very weird that our parents are dating. it just makes the entire family dynamic feel uncomfortable, i can\u2019t imagine them introducing us to someone.. what would they say? \u201cthis is my daughter, and her boyfriend, who is also my son\u201d?? it just feels wrong. my boyfriends dad has been a lot more reasonable than my mom, he understands this will be an adjustment for us and is very against us breaking up but he can\u2019t seem to get my mom to understand it", "I admit I may have overreacted at first but it was mainly because if I had a daughter I would never even consider dating her father in law so it was difficult for me to wrap my head around. But legally, not biologically, we would be married step siblings.. this makes both me and my boyfriend extremely uncomfortable. Especially considering if they could end up having children, me and my boyfriend would share a sibling as well\u2026", "my mom is too old to get pregnant (i think so at least lol), but thats the issue that bothers me and my boyfriend as well. it just creates a very strange dynamic in our families and i don\u2019t understand why, of all people, she wants to get with my future FIL..", "i understand there\u2019s no blood relations going on, but i just would never even consider doing something like that to my daughter when i have one, so im struggling to wrap my head around it", "[removed]", "Hopefully she is too old for it in this case but human anatomy is weird sometimes", "Exactly it's really inconsiderate. Whether people like it or not, kids will always be part of choosing a good romantic partner, even if those kids are adults. Like obviously if you just disliked the person she chose, that shouldn't affect her love life. But this is a whole different situation", "yes, and i think the whole thing is absurd. my boyfriend\u2019s dad seems a lot more understanding of us being uncomfortable with it though, unlike my mom who is dead set on us breaking up"]}
