Just because many people don't wind up with or marry their first loves, doesn't mean no one does, and you and Matt are clearly committed to each other. It's weird that she and your boyfriend's dad decided to date, but hey, if they want to tell people when they ask how they met that they met through their children who have been in a committed relationship for 4+ years than that's their choice and they are the ones that are going to get a raised eyebrow.", "NTA  \n\nI would have the same reaction if I was in your shoes. \n\nI can't understand how she says you should break with him just because she's RECENTLY dating his father, who is going to be your father-in-law.

So much so that I have to wonder whether she was serious, or was saying it to point out how daft your own objection to her dating was.\n\nEither way, the obvious answer is that all 4 of you grow up and accept that you and Matt are n a relationship an that your mum and Matt's dad are now also in a relationship, and that as you are all adults and capable of making your own choices, there's nothing wrong with that and no one has to break up unless they want to.", "ESH your mother firstly because she has no place to expect or make you break up just because she\u2019s dating your boyfriends dad. \n\nHowever there is no way you\u2019d be like step siblings in the way that is gross or ethically questionable.

You said this was a recent development, your mum dating you BF's dad so it's more than a bit presumptuous of her to decide her relationship is going the distance while yours won't.\n\nBeing step-siblings is as 'real' a relation as being inlaws. It's a social convention. Obviously context is important and not saying the step-siblings can't be just as close and have the same relationship as actual siblings but it doesn't make you and your BF actually related. If your mum and his dad are attracted to and care for each other cool, but it doesn't suddenly make you brother and sister.\n\nOn to the BTA take. Telling your mum it's inappropriate for her to date your BF's dad is a bit out of line. Just like them dating doesn't make you and your BF's relationship somehow incestuous, you two being in a relationship doesn't somehow make their relationship inappropriate. I get the gut reaction, it's not a situation you'd ever think you'd be confronted with but you are all adults.\n\nIf your mum is out of line for thinking your relationship is inappropriate you're out of line for thinking the same thing but her expectation that you'd end your relationship because of hers is what swings this one in your favour.", "Mild ESH - no one needs to break up with anyone, mom is fine to date whomever she chooses.

It's apparent that your mom doesn't see you as an adult or respect your relationship with Matt. You had every right to be mad especially her telling you that it was  \"Obvious\" your relationship should end. Sorry, what???\n\nPersonally speaking, it's weird to me that she and  Matt's dad would hook up as if nothing else it brings about those \"inbred\" jokes even though that isn't really the case. But really, one would think you'd consider your potential in-law's parent off-side to date. I actually know of people where this happened and it just seems weird to me. Same with if a sibling liked a partner's sibling. Again, that's just me.\n\nYou mom, Matt's dad and anyone who sides with them are major AH.", "NTA but I\u2019ll can see FP and Alice form Riverdale \n\nAnd if you update I need to know what going on Because you\u2019ve been together for 4 years that\u2019s not a high school romance meanwhile your mom just started his dad so wtf  it seems your mom is the one with the teenage romance", "Go elope.

She\u2019s free to date whoever she wants, although it\u2019s pretty bad form to date Matt\u2019s father IMO. But expecting you to break up because of it is completely out of line. You\u2019re an adult to, I\u2019d be telling her she\u2019s seriously damaging your relationship with her and you won\u2019t be in contact with her / consider her your parent until she acts like it.", ">silly middle age romance\n\nThis!!! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\n\nT-shirt this if you have too!", "Does Matt's father know that the mother wants to break the couple up?

Maybe dating apps are intimidating. You meet someone single through your kids and hit it off. I'd imagine people might raise their eyebrows for a second, but once you establish a quick timeline of the relationships, is it really weird? If the OP was just friends with the son  or instead a daughter this would be a Disney show.\n\nTo be fair, this situation exists in my distant family.
