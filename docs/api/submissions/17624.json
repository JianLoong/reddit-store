After a little pushing, Pat said that he and Sam won\u2019t be around because of it. \n\nAbout a week ago Pat and Sam came our parents house. I was there and was happy to see both of them so I came out to talk. I was wearing a pair of green leggings and a low cut green crop top. The top showed my sternum tattoo and a tiny bit of my side boob. The shirt kinda requires to go bra-less or you\u2019d see it. When I came out Sam looked uncomfortable but she is normal very awkward so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. After a short time of talking they slowly made their way back to the car and hovered around it whispering. My mom and I found it very weird but just assumed something was going on between them. \n\nToday was our sisters birthday and I was surprised he wasn\u2019t there. He is always at every birthday so I asked him why he wasn\u2019t there today. After pushing he told me that Sam was uncomfortable with how I dressed and no longer wanted to be around the family if I was there. I was very hurt and honestly shocked to hear that. I have been very welcoming and kind to her since she started dating Pat (about 2-3 months). After learning this information I talked to my mom who said that Pat and Sam called her to vent their concerns and my mother blew up on him saying that Sam was projecting her own insecurities onto me and that Pat should be ashamed to be allowing this behavior. I confronted Pat and completely blew up. \n\nAfter Pat continued to back Sam\u2019s opinion I snapped. I told him that both of them can fuck off because I am not going to dim my light to comfort a girl I barely know. I then told him she\u2019s just upset that she doesn\u2019t have a body and can\u2019t hold the fact that I have one over my head. It was maybe a step too far but truthfully I\u2019m not sorry I said it. After absolutely exploding on him, Pat asked for me to just keep the peace for \u201cthe family\u2019s sake\u201d and to not trash talk Sam. I told Pat that for now on I will dress like a \u201cslut\u201d when he and Sam are around just to twist the knife a little. \n\nMy mother has my back but my father said I should\u2019ve been the bigger person and went about it in more of an adult manner to keep the peace. Am I the asshole by airing out how I truly feel to Pat and Sam?\n\nThis is the shirt I was wearing [green shirt](https://imgur.com/a/d1PmSs9)", "created_utc": 1684467381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ljvpj/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_brother_and_his_gf_for/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not saying I would have necessarily had the patience to have done it maturely and I'm 50 lol.  Sounds like a 'Sam' problem to me.

If it bothers her that your brother sees you dressed that way then maybe she has some serious jealousy issues.", "NTA - dress how you like and in what makes you feel comfy, but telling him you will be putting in an effort to get his gf out of her comfort zone is a bit of a childish move.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t see why she cares how you dress. It\u2019s also weird your brother would let her talk about you but doesn\u2019t want you to talk about her?? The fact he skipped his other sister\u2019s birthday is crazy. She could\u2019ve stayed home. She didn\u2019t have to be there. It\u2019s weird and disturbing she\u2019s comparing her body to the body of her bf\u2019s sister, and demanding he stay away. I\u2019m sure he knows not to hook up with his sister.", "NTA. She took issue with your body first and made that everyone\u2019s issue. You may have gone a bit too far but as someone who\u2019s been in similar situations regarding how I dress I can completely understand how frustrating it is.

I mean yikes. Not exactly a win for women everywhere or intersectionality with this one but I guess that isn\u2019t the point of this post. She is very weird to sexualize her boyfriends sister. It kinda sounds like she see you as someone she has to compete with sexually for her boyfriend\u2019s attention which is bizarre. From what you said it sounds like they do not have a stable relationship and they are moving way to quickly. Hopefully they burn out soon and breakup because she sounds like an absolute piece of work. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nWeird. I can see being upset about a scantily clad ex but a sister?", "NTA.

You're definitely not in the wrong, but sometimes it's good to be the bigger person, you know? It seems Sam's got some insecurities, and your brother is kinda stuck in the middle, even if he doesn't see it. So for his sake, maybe just let it go. That being said, you should totally keep wearing what you've been wearing! You shouldn't have to change your style because of someone else's issues.", "NTA.

So he's choosing to kick you to the side to make his Gf of 3 months comfortable. \n\nBy telling you they won't come if you're there, he's essentially telling you, and the people around you, to make sure you're not there if they want him there. He's not even giving the option of coming alone instead of with his girlfriend.\n\nAlso, I love the shirt. It's hella cute, especially with your tattoo \ud83e\udd70", "nta. lol why do you have to \"not trash talk sam\" when that is ALL sam has done to you?\n\nI get your bro is going to side with her because of sex. Now that Sammykins has gotten rid of sexy sister she will go after sexy cousin, then sexy bff, then she will go after Pat's best friends girl friend because she wore a bikini once at the beach when it was hot.\n\nPat is after it for the vagina. Sam will make sure she is the ONLY female in his life, and then will cut him off of the vagina, and he won't even have a sister to help him with his shitty boring life, that has no friends because she ran them all off.", "NTA.

Same with the 'keep the peace'. Your dad is backing up a girl he just met over his own daughter.", "NTA. You were lounging around your own home. Had you known they were coming over possibly you would have put something more modest on, but even if not, Sam sounds insufferable. \n\nYou have every right to dress how you wish and for your brother to tell you about Sam and her issues with the way you dress is definitely a her problem.\n\nYou must have hit the nail on the head with the comment about Sams body and her inadequate feelings but your brother pushed you into saying it. \n\nI hope you do dress slutty when you know they are coming over, that's the job description for siblings, to make their siblings uncomfortable.

The blowing up, while unfortunate is not assholish.", "I'm leaning toward ESH, just because of the way you went on about Sam not having a body.  That was kinda harsh.  And saying you'll purposefully dress slutty to twist the knife is a bit immature.  \n\nObviously your brother & gf are WAY out of line. Your parents didn't seem to take issue with the way you were dressed.  And it's not like you were showing up on Sam's doorstep in your underwear.  \n\nKeep doing you.
