After a little pushing, Pat said that he and Sam won\u2019t be around because of it. \n\nAbout a week ago Pat and Sam came our parents house. I was there and was happy to see both of them so I came out to talk. I was wearing a pair of green leggings and a low cut green crop top. The top showed my sternum tattoo and a tiny bit of my side boob. The shirt kinda requires to go bra-less or you\u2019d see it. When I came out Sam looked uncomfortable but she is normal very awkward so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. After a short time of talking they slowly made their way back to the car and hovered around it whispering. My mom and I found it very weird but just assumed something was going on between them. \n\nToday was our sisters birthday and I was surprised he wasn\u2019t there. He is always at every birthday so I asked him why he wasn\u2019t there today. After pushing he told me that Sam was uncomfortable with how I dressed and no longer wanted to be around the family if I was there. I was very hurt and honestly shocked to hear that. I have been very welcoming and kind to her since she started dating Pat (about 2-3 months). After learning this information I talked to my mom who said that Pat and Sam called her to vent their concerns and my mother blew up on him saying that Sam was projecting her own insecurities onto me and that Pat should be ashamed to be allowing this behavior. I confronted Pat and completely blew up. \n\nAfter Pat continued to back Sam\u2019s opinion I snapped. I told him that both of them can fuck off because I am not going to dim my light to comfort a girl I barely know. I then told him she\u2019s just upset that she doesn\u2019t have a body and can\u2019t hold the fact that I have one over my head. It was maybe a step too far but truthfully I\u2019m not sorry I said it. After absolutely exploding on him, Pat asked for me to just keep the peace for \u201cthe family\u2019s sake\u201d and to not trash talk Sam. I told Pat that for now on I will dress like a \u201cslut\u201d when he and Sam are around just to twist the knife a little. \n\nMy mother has my back but my father said I should\u2019ve been the bigger person and went about it in more of an adult manner to keep the peace.

It\u2019s also weird your brother would let her talk about you but doesn\u2019t want you to talk about her?? The fact he skipped his other sister\u2019s birthday is crazy. She could\u2019ve stayed home. She didn\u2019t have to be there. It\u2019s weird and disturbing she\u2019s comparing her body to the body of her bf\u2019s sister, and demanding he stay away. I\u2019m sure he knows not to hook up with his sister.", "NTA. She took issue with your body first and made that everyone\u2019s issue.

I mean yikes. Not exactly a win for women everywhere or intersectionality with this one but I guess that isn\u2019t the point of this post. She is very weird to sexualize her boyfriends sister. It kinda sounds like she see you as someone she has to compete with sexually for her boyfriend\u2019s attention which is bizarre. From what you said it sounds like they do not have a stable relationship and they are moving way to quickly. Hopefully they burn out soon and breakup because she sounds like an absolute piece of work. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nWeird. I can see being upset about a scantily clad ex but a sister?", "NTA.

You're definitely not in the wrong, but sometimes it's good to be the bigger person, you know? It seems Sam's got some insecurities, and your brother is kinda stuck in the middle, even if he doesn't see it. So for his sake, maybe just let it go. That being said, you should totally keep wearing what you've been wearing! You shouldn't have to change your style because of someone else's issues.", "NTA.

So he's choosing to kick you to the side to make his Gf of 3 months comfortable. \n\nBy telling you they won't come if you're there, he's essentially telling you, and the people around you, to make sure you're not there if they want him there.

Had you known they were coming over possibly you would have put something more modest on, but even if not, Sam sounds insufferable. \n\nYou have every right to dress how you wish and for your brother to tell you about Sam and her issues with the way you dress is definitely a her problem.\n\nYou must have hit the nail on the head with the comment about Sams body and her inadequate feelings but your brother pushed you into saying it. \n\nI hope you do dress slutty when you know they are coming over, that's the job description for siblings, to make their siblings uncomfortable.

World doesn't revolve around Sam and op is ok as long as she  covered intimate parts - this from someone who dresses rather conservative but it's MY DECISION on MY BODY I didn't have the right to push this on anyone else.\n\n\nWomen faught for years and years for equality and the right to decide for themselves. Sam needs to work on her mental issues cause it's a HER problem", "What comfort zone? Her comfort zone shouldn't be dictated by what clothes OP wears, and if it is that's completely on her.", "She literally said she know she went too far. Repeating it to her doesn't help.", "Yeah, I was N T A until that line. That's way over the line and fucked up. ESH.", "THIS says it all\n\nOP you keep saying in comments how you regret what you said, you regret being a bully, you could have gone about it better. Okay, you bodyshamed a woman for simply saying she was uncomfortable, now what are you going to do about it? Do you truly regret and believe that you mishandled The conversation around your right to dress however you want?\n\nThe opportunity exists to do better, yes you can absolutely dress and do whatever you want to do with your body, no, you really can't run your mouth and abuse others, hiding behind the excuse that others hurt you is terrible. Pull up your big girl panties, reach out to your brother and tell him you've reflected on this and while you regret how you reacted You stand by your position that how you dress is completely up to you, you should not have said anything beyond that and certainly not have body shamed his girlfriend. Tell him it would be nice to have a relationship with the two of them, but they have to understand you're not going to shift your wardrobe as this is how you like to dress but you do understand their perspective.\n\nYTA.... Body shaming anybody says far more about you, your defense about doing it and lashing out because others have hurt you in the past, screams You need to unwind those issues in your head before you permanently damaged some relationships that you might regret damaging in the future, it's a hard thing to push away a sibling, whether the girlfriend stays around or not, siblings are forever, do you want him out of your life? Do you want the dynamic to shift like this?", "Been looking for this one. Yes it is none of her business how she dresses and she can dress how she wants, but people are perfectly allowed to remove themselves when they are uncomfortable. Not everyone is comfortable around people dressing like that and it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not necessarily an insecurity. OP handled this poorly and is projecting her own insecurities. I\u2019d lean towards ESH just because of them venting behind her back.", "Yea honestly, expecting *everyone* to be comfortable around someone that barely has 3 inches of cloth covering their tit, would be like expecting *everyone* to be comfortable around a man in a banana-hammock. Its a barely covered, sexual organ! Of course some people would be uncomfortable? I don\u2019t understand why people are shaming that and calling it prudish.", "lol ew like it's any of your business", "Can confirm. My boobs destroyed 3 villages before I could wrangle them into a proper bra and calm down.", "Actually, before the children part, it sounded like a legit old wife's parable from the old days. Like, describing a home wrecker in a more exaggerated fashion. Lol.", "Oh no! Where?\n\nOP. NTA.", "I let my small children eat my untamed boobs, and I never knew I was doing it the wrong way around. TIL.", "Sounds like a fun way to go out.", "*spongebob voice* I LOST SOMETHING ONCE", ">After pushing he told me that Sam was uncomfortable with how I dressed and no longer wanted to be around the family if I was there. \\[...\\] I talked to my mom who said that Pat and Sam called her to vent their concerns\n\n1) Sam has declared she \\*no longer\\* (i.e. indefinitely, not just for this one event) wants to be around the whole family because of how OP dressed on a specific occasion.\n\n2) Sam (and Pat) decided to complain to OP's mother about \"their concerns\", rather than discussing it with OP like the adults that all three of them are. I can't really see what they did that for, if not because they wanted OP's mother to intervene and make OP dress differently.\n\nSam does not have to be around someone with whom she is uncomfortable, sure. I might personally think she's a bit snowflake-y for feeling that uncomfortable with someone else's clothing. But to interfere in OP's relationship with her family (by ensuring that Pat does not go to his sister's birthday, and by trying to cause friction between OP and her mother), that's where she becomes the AH.", "I agree with you. There isn\u2019t really much in the post about Sam and why she feels uncomfortable. She just wasn\u2019t comfortable with what OP was wearing and OP and her mom are lashing out calling her jealous and deliberately trying to make her uncomfortable. Because of that OP is definitely an AH, but not enough info to know if she\u2019s the only one.", "I agree with you.

You just be you and continue to be fabulous and lovely. It's literally her problem. Just keep looking like the better/nicer person.", "He deserved it for the unreasonable ask", "I was with you until the \"she doesn't have a body\" comment. Everyone has a body and they're all equally valuable.\n\nShe doesn't have the right to dictate what you wear according to her insecurities but it sounds like you also have a shitty attitude about bodies.", "Poor brother's never gonna be allowed to go to the beach.", "But what does it mean?\n\nNot having a body?\n\nIs she a ghost? \n\nIf I was Sam I'd totally show up dressed in a big white sheet with two holes for the eyes for the next family event(s). I'd purposely they to sit on top of you or walk right into you, because since I don't have a body, we can't touch and I can float right through you.\n\nEverybody has a body (the last part of the word everybody is a big hint here).\nYou now how to get a bikini body? Put a bikini on. Tada! Bikini body. \n\n BTW. Sam would probably be offended by me in any shirt. My bra size is 70-I (European), so anything short of an oversized hoodie makes me look like booberella. I don't really like sleeves. I've at some point stopped trying to find shirts that show zero cleavage or side boob. The world is just going to have to live with seeing a bit of my side or top boob or both. \n\nNTA for wearing what you did.", "It was rude, but fuck her. We both know that her whole attitude was implying you were a nasty ho. Call people names and get called names.", "One of the Clerics in Iran actually blamed earthquakes on woman not wearing bras", "Seems like you're filling in a lot to make this conclusion. This lady is around a family where OP even says they talk shit about her and have tried convincing the brother to leave her, id say there's just a good chance she's just over OP and her family and picked a random thing instead of dealing with the fallout from saying any real problem.", "OP's mum is lashing out because Sam brought OP's mum into it, by calling to voice her \"concerns\".\n\nOP is lashing out because her brother isn't going to their sister's birthday due to Sam. Sam doesn't have to go, but why does Pat also have to stay away?", "Further detail, via one of OP's comments: brother and his gf have been dating for 3 months, and moved in together after 2 months of that; there is already talk of marriage. Hmm. I guess brother is not thinking clearly because he's head over heels, and/or gf is using this issue as a wedge to isolate him from his family.", "Lol was definitely thinking of the children when I got mine reduced.", "She literally said she would not attend a family event if OP was there because of how OP dressed one time. That is unreasonable, ridiculous, & controlling.", "That doesn't give you the right to be an asshole. Her trauma is hers to deal with.", "The advice is always don't put yourself in situations you're uncomfortable in until someone doesn't like what makes you uncomfortable.", "Sam has clearly met OP on other occasions & has never had an issue with how OP dressed until this one time. So assuming she's going to be uncomfortable every time? Yeah, that utterly nonsensical. Also, based on OP's comments, it's wildly clear Sam is trying to isolate Pat from his family & OP just provided an excuse.", "Weird seems to me that OPs family are AHs to the GF and she doesn't want to be around them so made up a reason instead of saying she doesn't like them.", "Yeah, typically when you try to isolate one family member from the rest & concoct bullshit reasons to do so, the family responds poorly. She got what she deserved & I hope OP's family leaves channels open for him to escape when the time comes.", "It's pretty much the definition of \"prude\" to be shocked/offended by any hint of sexuality. I'm friends with an asexual couple that don't bat an eye at the rest of our group's mini skirts and halter tops but when our other friend brought around his new girlfriend she had plenty to say about everyone else's choices in clothing. She wore a lot of beige and long sleeves/pants/turtlenecks in July. If she hadn't opened her mouth we wouldn't have cut them off from the group. That shit gets real old real fast."]}
