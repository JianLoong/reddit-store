{"id": 17624, "submission_id": "13ljvpj", "title": "AITA for blowing up on my brother and his gf for shaming my clothes", "selftext": "I (24f) got a text from my older brother (25 who I will call Pat) today saying that him and his gf (who i will call sam) will not be coming to celebrate our sisters birthday because Sam doesn\u2019t want to hang out with me. After a little pushing, Pat said that he and Sam won\u2019t be around because of it. \n\nAbout a week ago Pat and Sam came our parents house. I was there and was happy to see both of them so I came out to talk. I was wearing a pair of green leggings and a low cut green crop top. The top showed my sternum tattoo and a tiny bit of my side boob. The shirt kinda requires to go bra-less or you\u2019d see it. When I came out Sam looked uncomfortable but she is normal very awkward so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. After a short time of talking they slowly made their way back to the car and hovered around it whispering. My mom and I found it very weird but just assumed something was going on between them. \n\nToday was our sisters birthday and I was surprised he wasn\u2019t there. He is always at every birthday so I asked him why he wasn\u2019t there today. After pushing he told me that Sam was uncomfortable with how I dressed and no longer wanted to be around the family if I was there. I was very hurt and honestly shocked to hear that. I have been very welcoming and kind to her since she started dating Pat (about 2-3 months). After learning this information I talked to my mom who said that Pat and Sam called her to vent their concerns and my mother blew up on him saying that Sam was projecting her own insecurities onto me and that Pat should be ashamed to be allowing this behavior. I confronted Pat and completely blew up. \n\nAfter Pat continued to back Sam\u2019s opinion I snapped. I told him that both of them can fuck off because I am not going to dim my light to comfort a girl I barely know. I then told him she\u2019s just upset that she doesn\u2019t have a body and can\u2019t hold the fact that I have one over my head. It was maybe a step too far but truthfully I\u2019m not sorry I said it. After absolutely exploding on him, Pat asked for me to just keep the peace for \u201cthe family\u2019s sake\u201d and to not trash talk Sam. I told Pat that for now on I will dress like a \u201cslut\u201d when he and Sam are around just to twist the knife a little. \n\nMy mother has my back but my father said I should\u2019ve been the bigger person and went about it in more of an adult manner to keep the peace. Am I the asshole by airing out how I truly feel to Pat and Sam?\n\nThis is the shirt I was wearing [green shirt](https://imgur.com/a/d1PmSs9)\n\nEdit:  I need to clarify a couple things. 1. Sam wasn\u2019t just saying she was uncomfortable, she said that I needed to actively change how I dress because of who I am. I don\u2019t know what the \u201cwho I am\u201d part means but it\u2019s not for me to understand. 2. I see no issue with me vilifying my brother. He wasn\u2019t an innocent by stander trying to mediate. He agreed with Sam that he didn\u2019t want to be around me with that much skin showing ONLY because Sam doesn\u2019t like it.

She could\u2019ve stayed home. She didn\u2019t have to be there. It\u2019s weird and disturbing she\u2019s comparing her body to the body of her bf\u2019s sister, and demanding he stay away. I\u2019m sure he knows not to hook up with his sister.", "NTA. She took issue with your body first and made that everyone\u2019s issue.

I mean yikes. Not exactly a win for women everywhere or intersectionality with this one but I guess that isn\u2019t the point of this post. She is very weird to sexualize her boyfriends sister. It kinda sounds like she see you as someone she has to compete with sexually for her boyfriend\u2019s attention which is bizarre. From what you said it sounds like they do not have a stable relationship and they are moving way to quickly.

So he's choosing to kick you to the side to make his Gf of 3 months comfortable. \n\nBy telling you they won't come if you're there, he's essentially telling you, and the people around you, to make sure you're not there if they want him there.
