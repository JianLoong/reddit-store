Now you'd have to arrange for your own food, plus spend the whole time avoiding everything there. It's too much to ask of a guest. \n\nIf I were uncharitable, I'd say your friend didn't care to do a simple thing to make your presence more for you, so I doubt he cares that much if you're there not.", "NTA ma che cazzo di amico \u00e8 questo \ud83e\udd0c", "NTA its kind of weird to not at least have a veg option at a wedding", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty standard to accomodate guests' food restrictions at a wedding reception. \n\nI see a lot of comments from americans usually on this site who say people should take the responsability to their own food restrictions. So maybe this is a cultural difference but I'm french and when I invite someone I accomodate them, it's basic hospitability imo. If someone don't want to do that, then they should not bother hosting anything.", "NTA This is ridiculous. The caterers would have asked about dietary restrictions. I wouldn't go either.", "I'm torn.  There's a lot that goes into a major wedding, and there's always something that gets forgotten.  I think had it been myself, I'd have made it clear to the groom that I'd be bringing my own meal, since there was nothing there I could eat.  As long as they were OK with that, I'd have attended.  But I don't mind making a point in public.", "NTA\n\nIf you invite someone to dinner, you need to provide food that they can eat. This isn't a case of catering to everyone's whims and taste preferences - you have coeliac disease, so will get very sick if you eat even a small quantity of gluten, and you're a Muslim, so are religiously prohibited from pork and alcohol. Presumably you'd also have to avoid other meat unless you knew it was slaughtered in a halal fashion.\n\nThat's a lot of restrictions to cope with, but the bonus is that all the restrictions are in the same person - you - so producing a gluten-free vegetarian meal shouldn't be beyond the capabilities of the kitchen.", "NTA...\nI have celiac disease. If I wanted to go to the wedding I'd eat ahead of time as I try not to inconvenience others with my diet restrictions.  However if it's not something youd enjoy, then catch a headache and skip the event.", "I understand feeling like an afterthought.  You likely were.  I don't understand why they couldn't make a last minute meal without the pork.  Surely the caterers have made a vegetarian option. If they can and he never even tried then NTA.  \n\nBut I think that if it's really just an oversight due to simply forgetting in the storm of a million different things maybe offer him a little grace and eat before or after or bring your own?  I've seen lots of weddings second hand and things can get so hectic that important things get forgotten.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe there isn\u2019t at least an accommodation for vegetarians, because this is very common.  But since there isn\u2019t, combined with the travel I wouldn\u2019t attend.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t take it personally.  Planning weddings and just getting married itself is high stress, high focus on self & families only.  Trying to accommodate both sets of parents is sometimes too difficult, much less all the friends, coworkers, extended family.  \n\nI\u2019d give the actual wedding a miss but not let it negatively impact my friendship.", "Folks saying \u201cjust being a sandwich\u201d might not be aware that many venues restrict people bringing in outside food for health and legality reasons, so that might not be an option for her.", "NTA, but i'm pretty sure your friendship will suffer. If you are fine with this, no problem. \n\nTbh, I get some main character vibes here. Planning a wedding is stressful, forgetting about diet restrictions for one single guest can happen. \n\nA good friend would say don't worry, i know my restrictions are a lot (they are, sorry) i will just eat before and still enjoy the wedding and be there to support you. \n\nA rather selfish friend would say since i was not your top priority when you planned your wedding i'm butthurt now and punish you by not attending. \n\nChoose for yourself which kind of friend you want to be. It depends a little how close you are and how important your friend is to you.", "I'm going to go against the grain and NAH. Should he have done better? Yeah, but also, wedding planning is hard, and it's entirely possible it was just a genuine mistake.

But I think you don't go to a wedding to eat. You go to celebrate a big milestone. If you can't eat anything on the menu then you can still bring a sandwich. A wedding is difficult enough to organize, you don't know what happened. Maybe his fiancee was more involved in choosing the menu, or his MIL was adamant about this main dish etc... I have dietary restrictions but I never expected to be catered for at a wedding. If it happened, great. If it didn't, nevermind, I always had a sandwich+protein bars ready just in case.", "NTA", "NTA they didn\u2019t want you there.", "NTA", "NTA.

You\u2019re a friend to one, and a friendly co-worker that they don\u2019t work with anymore to the other. \n\n It\u2019s kinda laughable to me that you \u201creminded\u201d the couple of your diet restrictions as though their menu should in any way, shape, or form revolve around you. It\u2019s funny to me cause Honey, your restrictions are LOWER, then the last thing on their minds. Let THEM pick the menu and if you can\u2019t eat anything on it, don\u2019t go. \n\nSure it stinks you couldn\u2019t go, but I\u2019m not sure why your upset at THEM, for not making their menu about YOU. Hate to break it to you, but this will NOT be last (and kinda doubt it was the first if I\u2019m being honest) event you\u2019ll get invited to where you will have to (or could of in this situation) just sip the complimentary water and nibble on a salad if your want to be able to show up for occasions.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA I don't understand how he asked for you to have gluten free but not halal?

That is too many things, be one less thing. /s", "Go to the ceremony, and skip the reception.\n\nOr, just demand that the wedding be cancelled because you're offended.", "NTA- the host should accommodate any guests eating restrictions. 4 weeks out is not too late to arrange for a meal for you.

I've neve been to a wedding without a vegetarian option.", "NTA.  If your presence was that important to them, they would have made dietary accommodations available for you, assuming they knew about them in advance.", "If yall are actually friends and not just former coworkers, they're the asshole. I abhor religion as a whole and even I would know to make pork and alcohol free options available for a Muslim friend if I invited one. That just seems deliberate if they know you're Muslim.", "NTA  for not going.  As far as forgetting, it's fine to feel feelings about it", "NTA.  That's odd to have every dish with pork, but to each his own.  Sorry your friend wasn't considerate.", "ESH - it would have been nice for your friend to think about you, but it\u2019s their wedding. Which has nothing to do with you. They have many guests with many restrictions. You are not their priority nor should you be. On the other hand you can choose not to attend for any reason you want. But not going over food is a little silly. You can bring your own food to eat before or after the dinner (assuming it\u2019s sit down and wouldn\u2019t be ok to bring your own food) they\u2019re your friends and want you there and still have the foresight to warn you and let you know. They have 7 thousand things to do for their wedding. Unfortunately they can\u2019t simply cater to everyone. But again, you can choose not to go for any reason you want.", "ESH. Yes he should have made the effort and honestly he probably didn't even try. That being said, you don't go to a wedding to eat. It's a celebration of your friends marriage and you are making it about you. If he didn't or couldn't include your demands at HIS wedding you will just take your toys and go home. Eat before you go, geez!", "YTA\n\nThis is not a reason to miss a friend's milestone. You can literally spend $20 to pick up a takeout meal and ask the kitchen to warm it for you given they have nothing you can eat. You're choosing to make this a problem when it's not. And NO you aren't going to be top of mind when they are trying to please two sets of families.", "NTA. I'm Italian and a vegetarian, I think you might make things worse by going and not eating or bringing a sandwich like some geniuses here are suggesting.\n\nI can't believe there's alcohol in every dish. Wtf.", "Yes. You could have eaten before hand and been there for your friend\u2019s special day to support them. Unfortunately you made it about yourself.", "Yta. It is not friends job to cater to your requirements at his wedding. You had the choice to go and skip the food and drinks at the reception or not go.  You choice was not to go.  This is all on you.  Not on your friend.  Grow up and get over yourself.  The world does not revolve around you. Friend was in no way obligated to cater special food just for you.", "I have diet restrictions from food allergies and I would never expect an event like a wedding to have something tailored to my specific diet.
