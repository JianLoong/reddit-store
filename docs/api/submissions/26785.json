So maybe this is a cultural difference but I'm french and when I invite someone I accomodate them, it's basic hospitability imo. If someone don't want to do that, then they should not bother hosting anything.", "NTA This is ridiculous. The caterers would have asked about dietary restrictions. I wouldn't go either.", "I'm torn.  There's a lot that goes into a major wedding, and there's always something that gets forgotten.  I think had it been myself, I'd have made it clear to the groom that I'd be bringing my own meal, since there was nothing there I could eat.  As long as they were OK with that, I'd have attended.  But I don't mind making a point in public.", "NTA\n\nIf you invite someone to dinner, you need to provide food that they can eat. This isn't a case of catering to everyone's whims and taste preferences - you have coeliac disease, so will get very sick if you eat even a small quantity of gluten, and you're a Muslim, so are religiously prohibited from pork and alcohol. Presumably you'd also have to avoid other meat unless you knew it was slaughtered in a halal fashion.\n\nThat's a lot of restrictions to cope with, but the bonus is that all the restrictions are in the same person - you - so producing a gluten-free vegetarian meal shouldn't be beyond the capabilities of the kitchen.", "NTA...\nI have celiac disease.

I don't understand why they couldn't make a last minute meal without the pork.  Surely the caterers have made a vegetarian option.

Which has nothing to do with you. They have many guests with many restrictions. You are not their priority nor should you be. On the other hand you can choose not to attend for any reason you want.

You need to adjust.", "NTA they invited you only to get a gift.", "NTA and stay home", "NTA, it\u2019s just basic etiquette to make sure all your guests have something to eat at your wedding. At that point (1 week out) he\u2019s probably already paid the caterer for the cost of your head to cover food and alcohol you can\u2019t even consume anyway. It\u2019s ridiculous to not make sure all your guests have something to eat", "Eh, NTA imo. It's an issue you might be able to work around pretty easily, but it is disappointing that he forgot about your dietary restrictions. You could give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he simply had a lot on his mind and your dietary restrictions were not at the top of his consideration list, but frankly, if you don't feel like going, you don't have to.", "NAH, Can't blame you for not going, that's understandable, but I think you should give him some grace. If it's a big wedding he's likely been dealing with a ton of details and stress, easy to forget to tell catering about 1 friend with restrictions of the tons of people invited to the wedding. I personally would have forgotten, I never think about things like this and even with a reminder I'd likely think \"oh yes i'll call the caterer on monday\" and it would probably slip my mind still. I have a vegetarian friend, known them like 10+ years, every time I see them and I have food I offer some and it basically always has meat. They don't even call me out, they just say \"no thanks\" and i'll even insist they try it without thinking until they laugh and I remember lol. It's nothing personal it just doesn't even occur to most people. My family hosts big parties all the time, I've been to multiple weddings, not once have I ever been asked about dietary restrictions.", "As a coeliac myself, same. NtA", "YTA. He didn\u2019t think of you as a guest!?!? Oh my goodness! Why didn\u2019t the groom think of his friend during this important time! How rude that you were not in the forefront of his mind. Why it\u2019s like he was planning a wedding for him and his wide to be. Darn shame.", "Must be cultural. American weddings have a card you check beef or fish.", "That made my laugh, ngl", "Not to mention the other guests are then going to, at minimum, side eye you. And if you don\u2019t eat at all, someone\u2019s definitely going to say something rude, and then OP has to put up with people being pricks or throw the groom under the bus (which frankly he deserves but isn\u2019t a nice thing to do during a wedding). Sure people should mind their own business but you know they won\u2019t.", "Bro would have gone to fyre festival for Ja Rule \ud83d\udc80", "\n\nOP has celiac disease. No sandwiches, perhaps lettuce wraps?", "Hardly little", "A wedding menu should cater to guests, it\u2019s incredibly rude to not accommodate allergies and dietary restrictions. I just planned my own wedding and did this, including emailing my caterer at the last minute on behalf of a guest who had forgotten to include her soy/dairy intolerance on the RSVP. Would have been incredibly embarrassing for a guest to have nothing to eat at my wedding.", "bread? Did you miss celiac disease?", "Good idea except OP said venue is far away.", "Do not 'catch a headache' at the last minute.  Your plate is prepaid, seating is arranged etc.   How about be honest?", "The wedding couple is exactly who is responsible for their guests\u2019 different diets. It\u2019s their responsibility to collect dietary and allergy restrictions and communicate this to their caterer to ensure every guest has something to eat. Tacky and lazy as hell to not do this.", "Nothing worse than being starving at a wedding while everyone else is eating.", "Sute. But every dish containing meat and alcohol also means you are a true AH to vegetarians, and alcoholics in recovery. (Yes, there are also AA meetings in Italy.)\nAnd the gluten bit? Coeliac is no joke.", "Vegetarian choice is on most responses these days.", "My cousin called me to figure out how to rsvp to my sisters wedding and when I said \"dietary restrictions\" on thr website she was like no... then later asked me if their was avocado in the food because she's allergic \ud83d\ude36", "\u201cNo restrictions that I know of!\u201d", "A wedding and a reception. Where everyone will be sitting down to enjoy a multi course meal. It's one thing not eating, sitting there for an hour or two or three while everyone else eats and drinks (alcohol) and becomes merry while you eat nothing, or some carrot sticks you bought from home is not a fun experience. \nAppallingly inhospitable behaviour from the hosts.", "Best wedding ever for banter was Nigerian wedding\n\nBest wedding for food was a Punjabi one\n\nWorst wedding was gujrati - 50 shades of daal/lentils and a ceremony that had a 6 page programme\u2026.", "Yeah this isn\u2019t just someone deciding to go on a fad diet or being a picky eater", "Unless I\u2019m missing something here, there\u2019s no pork products used in making risotto. \n\nAnd they\u2019ll have a salad course - a house salad should be safe. I know it\u2019s not a meal but as a vegetarian I\u2019ve made do with less.", "I politely disagree. It is only in recent years that everyone demands to be entitled to have their every need and wish given. I was a caterer and wedding cake designer for 30 years. I am personally gluten intolerant and allergic to some other things. Not once in my career was I asked or demanded for special meals. We agreed on a variety of dishes and several entries so anyone could find something they could eat. There wasn't all of this whining and fussing about every little thing. And personally, I always found something at weddings and events that I could eat. No throwing a fit for me. I'm a grown adult with manners", "Eh, I don't think he's an AH, but if he's not a best friend or family member, I'm not surprised that the groom wasn't tracking the need for the a special plate for him. My own brother asked me just the last month what I don't eat because he couldn't remember. Moments like this remind me of how helpful wedding planners are. My fam is big and very DIY when it comes to weddings, but we've also helped out at other people's weddings and I've seen a lot more important prominent wedding things get forgotten.\n\nI vote NTA, but I don't think the friend's  forgetting is quite as malicious/cold/uncaring as many are depicting in the comments.", "A person who is getting married is thinking about more than a friend's dietary conditions.\n\nHe can do what most people do who have restricted diets, eat before or after.\n\nAnd celebrate your friends marriage.", "I mean, I'd be lying if I said I can always remember every one of my friends' dietary preferences.", "Not just religious - eating wheat is painful and destructive to someone with Celiacs. I knew a guy who died because he didn\u2019t lay off the gluten. They take damage every time.", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s wedding; he\u2019s not in the wedding party; his friend probably isn\u2019t even throwing the wedding (groom); he makes no mention of knowing the bride much; he\u2019s going to an ITALIAN WEDDING; maybe this is just AI baiting us.", "I once fed a lifelong Muslim family friend menudo, he loved it and finished the whole bowl, he didn't ask what was in it until after and then I was like ohhhh shit... If you don't have restrictions yourself it's very easy to forget these details.", "Didn't care is harsh. Super busy with last minute details, yes, A wedding planner would have taken care of it.", "OP was told every course had pork in it so I\u2019m not sure how you know the menu better", "Celiac disease is physical!", "People usually have more variety in their catering than everything pork.  I'm surprised that there weren't other choices.", "Are you the friend?", "I just had the mental image of like, playing a video game and the screen just flashing red from eating bread and the health bar going down a little more every time.", "I don\u2019t. I just know how to make risotto.", "It is safe to assume there are sides,", "We were in the same workout class and it was very much like that. But the flashing bar was his partner talking about how much bread and pasta he\u2019d eaten plus his wincing with each squat.", "Do you really think that's an appropriate response?", "Well, the person I actually was replying to thought it was fine, so yeah.", "It\u2019s not a terrible burden at all though, it\u2019s just part of planning a wedding. Our RSVPs had a section for this and I just sent the list of restrictions/allergies to our caterer. Not hard and takes barely any extra time on the hosts\u2019 part. I\u2019m sorry your friends were shitty hosts.", "At my cousin's wedding there were a number of Jews who followed Kosher laws.  The staff had the seating plan and knew where each guest was and their choice for dinner."]}
