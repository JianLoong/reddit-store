{"id": 25942, "submission_id": "166fms3", "title": "AITA for not wanting to give up my prom shoes?", "selftext": "I (19f) and my mother (50f) have an argument. For a little background: I graduated a few months ago and I went to prom with a pair of lovely pink shiny shoes. One thing you should know first is that even tho I'm 19 I'm really short (4'11, 150cm) and the size of the shoes is 34 (4,5) which is a children's size.These shoes are very formal and I'm unlikely to wear them often or even ever again but they have a huge sentimental value for me because they're from prom. You should also know that they weren't expensive or anything, because they are meant for children. So to the problem: The daughter of one of my mother's collegues saw my prom pictures and apparently she really liked the shoes. She's 10 years old btw. She talked to my mother and asked her if she would give her my shoes as a present for the beginning of the new school year so she can wear them on the first day of school and my mother promised she will give them to her without even talking to me first. Today she just came to me and told me (she didn't ask me, she straight up told me) that she will give the shoes to that girl. Naturally, I was really upset and I explained to her that these shoes mean a lot to me and that I'm also hurt that she promised to give away something mine without asking me first. She started saying that I won't wear them again, that they will make the girl really happy and that I have a chance to do something good for someone else. She also said that it's pointless for the shoes to just stay in a drawer for years without being used. I told her that these points are valid, but still, these are my shoes from prom and I wanna keep them. I also told her that I'm confused how this girl just saw someone else's shoes and asked for them and her mother was completely ok with this. I offered the alternative to give her the shoes for the first day of school but demanded to get them back afterwards. My mother thinks I'm an asshole now. She apologized for not asking me first but accused me of not wanting to make a child happy. I asked her why couldn't the child's parents buy her the same shoes since they were not expensive and we can always tell them where we bought them from, but she said that since these are very formal shoes, the parents don't want to waste money on them.

Also, you have an unusual size which might make it more likely that you will need to re-wear shoes because you might not be able to find many that fit you in the future.
