She probably didn\u2019t see it coming and it was just really bad timing. But I also wonder why she took so long just because of her period. Maybe GI distress and that is common. But If you can, I would maybe just have a chat with her telling her that if she knows that others will be needing the bathroom and she knows ahead of time that she may be a while, maybe its the best idea to use the other bathroom. But maybe also ask if she is okay as 30 minutes is a long time to be in the bathroom and maybe she should talk to a gynecologist about whatever she is experiencing. \nFinal idea that worked in my one bathroom household growing up. Shower Caddies. Go to the store and get them each a color coded plastic shower caddy with a handle that they can take in and out of the bathroom with them. Its a place to keep makeup, personal products, special skincare, etc. With that many teens with one bathroom, its absolutely necessary to have a backup plan.", "NAH.

No teenager wants to enter their parents private bathroom any time they are on their period, that\u2019s weird.  Also, you have two daughters so you need to put more effort into learning about periods.  The bigger issue is why are they all doing makeup in the bathroom?  Get them vanity mirrors for their bedroom.  I never kept makeup in a bathroom until I was an adult with my own space.

I know I have spent the better part of a couple of hours holed up in the bathroom because it feels like the safest place to be when im bleeding everywhere (on top of the whole host of other symptoms I get). if you told her that her period was a hinderance and she needed to clear out of the communal bathroom because she was being inconvenient whilst she was feeling unwell, it is more than understandable that she would not consider this a kindness. especially because you seem to be prioritising your other children's beauty products over Carla's necessary hygiene products at least. it is more important that she has access to these necessities than Brandon and Lila have their makeup, although I understand the frustration at being late.\n\nperhaps you can do some research on period symptoms, and find a kind way to talk to carla about her experience of her period and then suggest an organisation of the bathrooms that would prevent this issue in the future.", "If youre a single dad with 2 daughters in puberty and dont know shit about periods, then you have your work cut out for you.\n\nI dont see why your daughter would refuse to use your bathroom.

Maybe it wasn't the changing of the pad/tampon itself that caused her to stay in the bathroom for so long. Some women, due to the same hormones that cause menstruation, experience diarrhea during it. Maybe (just spitballing, but it is possible) she was having an episode of diarrhea that couldn't be interrupted? Maybe she didn't want to have to explain that to OP? I don't know. It still seems excessive. Maybe OP needs to have a talk with daughter about her menstrual cycle to ensure daughter isn't having issues. \n\nRegardless, I agree with other commenters -- have more than one supply of menstrual products available, for starters. Secondly, find a different solution for the makeup being in the bathroom. With four people in the house, having someone use the bathroom just for makeup when it may be needed for bodily functions/hygiene is not optimal, even with a second bathroom. I know you said it was a temporary thing due to construction, but there has to be some other method. Get the twins some small lit mirrors to have in their room with their makeup?\n\nAlso, did I read that right and your twins of the opposite sex share a room? I'm not trying to pry or judge you, but unless your twin children are happy with that arrangement, it doesn't seem at their age that either of them could have any privacy, and 15 is an age where privacy is needed. Again, not judging you for that, just a thought.

You didn't make her hide it, you just made the suggestion that she move them to your bathroom.\nThat said, I think it makes more sense for the girls to share a bathroom because they will both have period products, and Brandon to move his stuff to your bathroom instead.\nThat way, one girl attending to hygiene won't stop the other girl using the facilities for something else.\n\nAlso, as a woman, there is nothing specific about a period that justifies lurking in the bathroom for 30 minutes.\n\nSorry  but 4 people and 2 bathrooms sometimes overlap is gonna happen. It's up to everyone to be considerate. 5 minutes is MORE than enough for anything except active diarrhoea (in which case you would have known about it).\nAnything else is just being selfish with the space when other people who need to use the space are under a time constraint.\nI do think hygiene takes precedence over primping for a bathroom space, but this time frame was unnecessary.\n\nThough I do think you should have feminine hygiene products in both bathrooms anyway. It just makes sense.\n\nIf someone is in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes that is not showering and I have to do something or get something in there, I'm coming in and they can deal with it.\nWe had 1 bathroom for 5 people. You learn to do your business fast or get comfy sharing the space.", "NAH you were only trying to find a suggestion for a problem without being mean or disrespectful.

Sometimes when people have a very heavy flow they will often still leak. One of the remedies to this is FREE BLEEDING where you don\u2019t try to staunch the blood flow at all. Some people choose period panties but some (like myself) find the feeling of carrying clots around with them gross. An alternative is sitting on the toilet for a long amount of time when you can tell your flow is heavy. \n\nThis is also a great remedy for cramps as the culprit a lot of the time for the cramping is your body\u2019s reaction to a chemical drenched peace of cotton touching such sensitive tissue \n\n\nRegardless it\u2019s still rude to do when you know others need the bathroom", "I think that she was in there for longer for other reasons. It takes only a minute longer to change period products. Either she had an upset stomach or was doing something else in there.

Maybe simply do an inventory of her items and make a kit to keep in your bathroom as well as the main one for the girls. You weren't being disrespectful but trying to offer an alternative. she is being super sensitive.", "NTA. You just went about it the wrong way. Instead of saying she should move her period products so she doesn't make other people late again, offer to buy her extra period products to keep in the other bathroom in case there's an issue and she needs access to another bathroom without disruptions. Go look at the products she has in the bathroom. Take pictures of the boxes/bags and then go to the pharmacy or Costco and load up on the same type of products. Ask a female employee for help with the photos if you're overwhelmed. Buy them, and then let your daughter know they're in there, and for her to check it out to just make sure it's the right kind.

I am a man too and I think everyone should talk about periods without the stigma, it's a normal bodily function.\n\nLong story short: it's mostly the hormones. But there can be some mechanical elements to it. Usually when you're on your period, there's more muscle contractions around the area (to get the uterine lining out in the form of menstruation ofc), which could potentially stimulate bowel movements.\n\nBut the actual reason that you pass stool more often is mostly prostaglandins. These chemicals aid in muscle contraction during menstruation and excess production goes straight into the bloodstream. The intestines are directly affected by this by proximity. You also absorb water differently before and during your period, which leads to water retention and bloating. This can cause the stool itself to have a consistency unlike that of your normal stools. You might be more prone to having diarrhea during menstruation.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that in-between periods, when progesterone peaks, it also affects your dietary habits by giving you cravings. Mostly for trash food. Keeping in mind the whole water retention issue, it can make some people REALLY constipated and barely go to the bathroom for a few days before menstruation starts. Combine that with the effects of prostaglandins... When they are finally on their period, it's quite literally a shit-fest. It's not only about feces btw, some people also urinate more than usual when the time comes (because of the aforementioned premenstrual water retention).\n\nObviously this all varies case-by-case. There is a spectrum of experience and many modifying factors: diet, hydration levels, hormones, the way each body reacts, preexisting conditions that affect the digestive tract...
