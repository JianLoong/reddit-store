She probably didn\u2019t see it coming and it was just really bad timing. But I also wonder why she took so long just because of her period. Maybe GI distress and that is common. But If you can, I would maybe just have a chat with her telling her that if she knows that others will be needing the bathroom and she knows ahead of time that she may be a while, maybe its the best idea to use the other bathroom. But maybe also ask if she is okay as 30 minutes is a long time to be in the bathroom and maybe she should talk to a gynecologist about whatever she is experiencing. \nFinal idea that worked in my one bathroom household growing up. Shower Caddies. Go to the store and get them each a color coded plastic shower caddy with a handle that they can take in and out of the bathroom with them.

No teenager wants to enter their parents private bathroom any time they are on their period, that\u2019s weird.  Also, you have two daughters so you need to put more effort into learning about periods.  The bigger issue is why are they all doing makeup in the bathroom?

Maybe it wasn't the changing of the pad/tampon itself that caused her to stay in the bathroom for so long. Some women, due to the same hormones that cause menstruation, experience diarrhea during it. Maybe (just spitballing, but it is possible) she was having an episode of diarrhea that couldn't be interrupted? Maybe she didn't want to have to explain that to OP? I don't know. It still seems excessive. Maybe OP needs to have a talk with daughter about her menstrual cycle to ensure daughter isn't having issues. \n\nRegardless, I agree with other commenters -- have more than one supply of menstrual products available, for starters. Secondly, find a different solution for the makeup being in the bathroom. With four people in the house, having someone use the bathroom just for makeup when it may be needed for bodily functions/hygiene is not optimal, even with a second bathroom. I know you said it was a temporary thing due to construction, but there has to be some other method. Get the twins some small lit mirrors to have in their room with their makeup?\n\nAlso, did I read that right and your twins of the opposite sex share a room? I'm not trying to pry or judge you, but unless your twin children are happy with that arrangement, it doesn't seem at their age that either of them could have any privacy, and 15 is an age where privacy is needed. Again, not judging you for that, just a thought. I know it isn't always feasible for someone to have a room for every child, of course.", "Long before bathrooms were indoors people had vanities in bedrooms.

You didn't make her hide it, you just made the suggestion that she move them to your bathroom.\nThat said, I think it makes more sense for the girls to share a bathroom because they will both have period products, and Brandon to move his stuff to your bathroom instead.\nThat way, one girl attending to hygiene won't stop the other girl using the facilities for something else.\n\nAlso, as a woman, there is nothing specific about a period that justifies lurking in the bathroom for 30 minutes.\n\nSorry  but 4 people and 2 bathrooms sometimes overlap is gonna happen. It's up to everyone to be considerate. 5 minutes is MORE than enough for anything except active diarrhoea (in which case you would have known about it).\nAnything else is just being selfish with the space when other people who need to use the space are under a time constraint.\nI do think hygiene takes precedence over primping for a bathroom space, but this time frame was unnecessary.\n\nThough I do think you should have feminine hygiene products in both bathrooms anyway. It just makes sense.\n\nIf someone is in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes that is not showering and I have to do something or get something in there, I'm coming in and they can deal with it.\nWe had 1 bathroom for 5 people.

Sometimes when people have a very heavy flow they will often still leak. One of the remedies to this is FREE BLEEDING where you don\u2019t try to staunch the blood flow at all. Some people choose period panties but some (like myself) find the feeling of carrying clots around with them gross. An alternative is sitting on the toilet for a long amount of time when you can tell your flow is heavy. \n\nThis is also a great remedy for cramps as the culprit a lot of the time for the cramping is your body\u2019s reaction to a chemical drenched peace of cotton touching such sensitive tissue \n\n\nRegardless it\u2019s still rude to do when you know others need the bathroom", "I think that she was in there for longer for other reasons. It takes only a minute longer to change period products. Either she had an upset stomach or was doing something else in there.

Instead of saying she should move her period products so she doesn't make other people late again, offer to buy her extra period products to keep in the other bathroom in case there's an issue and she needs access to another bathroom without disruptions. Go look at the products she has in the bathroom. Take pictures of the boxes/bags and then go to the pharmacy or Costco and load up on the same type of products. Ask a female employee for help with the photos if you're overwhelmed. Buy them, and then let your daughter know they're in there, and for her to check it out to just make sure it's the right kind.

Took me about half an hour this morning", "Watching grass grow is more fun.", "Yep. \n\nAlso you can't forget the chance of the hormones rising in juuuust the right way that you start puking too.", "If you were getting ready to go out, had to do your hair and makeup, all of your stuff is kept in that bathroom, and your sibling went in that bathroom knowing they wouldn\u2019t be out for over a half hour, wouldn\u2019t you be pissed they didn\u2019t use the spare bathroom that was empty? Yes, you would.", "i had a seizure reading this", "From what is described, I do believe you\u2019d be right!", "Yes I would. But I didn't say the kids were assholes. They acted like teenagers.\n\nOP telling his daughter she's not allowed to use her own bathroom when she's on her period because her siblings keep their stuff in that same bathroom is what makes him the asshole.\n\nAlso, 30 minutes... Maybe he should worry about his daughter and get \u00e9ducated on periods instead of shaming her.", "Literally one word was misspelled lmao", "You complain about that person having a typo but you spell \"their\" as \"there\" and you don't capitalize. Hypocrite.", "Yah he\u2019s trying to stop the drama by parenting. \n\nYou\u2019re making this into a shame thing when it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just time management. \n\nIf he moved the makeup and stuff into his bathroom I guarantee you wouldn\u2019t have an issue with it and say he\u2019s \u201cmakeup shaming\u201d. \nPeriods happen less frequent than hair and makeup, and OP probably still wants his bathroom for himself the majority of the time. \n\nAs a woman who actually gets a period I see no problem with this. It\u2019s not like he told his daughter to keep her dirty period out of that bathroom and use the outhouse outside with the rest of the animals."]}
