Sorry, but your kiddos are gonna be teased their whole lives for this, so YTA for giving such strange names.", "ESH. Of course any adult who bullies a kid for their name is an AH. \n\nHowever, you also suck for not thinking the names of your children through. I googled Ichabod and Ulbrich and it says Ichabod means either *no honour* or *no glory.* Ichabod wouldn\u2019t have an easy time among peers even without that meaning but once the other kids look it up it\u2018ll only get worse. Ulbrich is only shown as surname of German origin. I happen to be German so I know we also have a similar first name, Ulrich, but even that will most likely lead to your child being bullied. To be fair, the actual meaning is a lot better (basically a rich heir), but still a name that guarantees a hard time in school.", "Info:  these aren\u2019t the real names, right?", "I think it\u2019s so incredibly mean of parents to do this. I\u2019ll\nTake the downvotes if they come. You were super selfish to name your son, in particular, Ichabod.

People laugh at unusual names, and kids get picked on for them. It's not fair, but it's a thing that happens. \n\nI am going with soft NTA because it is NOT OK for an early intervention worker to be mocking the names of her clients' children, but unfortunately other people may well mock this name. Are any of her jokes related to headless horsemen or Sleepy Hollow by any chance? Because this is probably most people's closest association with the name Ichabod, unfortunately, and even though she shouldn't be doing it and it would be reasonable to report her for it and for accusing you of bullying, it's probably a good idea to plan ahead for how you'll handle it when other people make the same jokes.", "YTA - you gave them names you liked without decent consideration for how these names will affect them throughout life.  As you\u2019ve already started to see, these names clearly stick out to the majority of people, and not in a good way.

Why would you make it more difficult? \n\nWinnifred can at least be shortened to \u201cWinnie\u201d. But Ichabod? Ulbrich?

The names are great, personally I think they're beautiful. But, off the top of my head, 2 of those names are connected with pop culture, one of which has endured and remained popular for over *two hundred years*. You can't expect that there won't be some push back, especially when your kids go to school. You name them for life, and you're right that there is nothing terribly bad about the association with the name. But your kids are going to get witch and pumpkin head jokes. You can't be angry with every person who references a headless horseman or Hocus Pocus. \n\nShe's the AH for being rude about it, but you're the AH for not thinking it through.", "Soft YTA as surely you saw your choice of names would be problematic? Children (and apparently adults) can be cruel and unfortunately you\u2019ve signed your kids up for a lifetime of being bullied. \n\nOn the plus side, kids are also quick to assign nicknames. I\u2019m sure Icky, Ullo and Fred will rise above.", "Yeah, those are stupid names to inflict upon your children. They'll be Rick, Freddie, and Bodi (if he's lucky, Icky if he isn't) by first grade...and you'll be the parent that tries to get the teacher fired for using their preferred names. YTA and, from one pale as snow white woman to another, that was mighty white of you", "LOL well even if your feelings are hurt, his family didn\u2019t really say anything unfair\u2026 Those names are hilarious. You really picked them thinking that they would never get shit for them? \n\nIt\u2019s a bummer that it\u2019s your own family who is giving you crap, they don\u2019t need to contribute to bullying, but you cannot seriously think that in naming your offspring these three names that I can\u2019t even type correctly would be easy \u2026\n\nYou ARE acting extremely white, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not even really that racist. You picked really funny names for your kids.", "Damn. . . . . . I mean. . . . You're not wrong just . . . You should have known what would happen. \n\nIt's like naming your child Khaleesi, X AE A-XII or Adolf Moses Billybob.", "ESH. unless you have some truly great nicknames for these kids, you've made their lives really difficult for no reason at all. growing up is hard enough without having a ridiculous name. use those for a cat or something, if you must, but think about your kids as people trying to get a job later in life. of course, it is also never okay for an adult to make fun of the name of the child they're working with. your husband was right, but so was she.", "Oh my god what a twist! I read this entire thing up to the point where you politely asked whoever is working with your kids to not make fun of their names. I was 100% on your side, what adult makes fun of a kid\u2019s name? Super reasonable, right? WRONG! ESH! \n\nChrist, OP, Ichabod and Ulbrich are my new go-to\u2019s when someone asks me for the ugliest names. They would\u2019ve already had those top spots if I could have even imagined somebody in the year 2023 would actually name their children that. Winnifred is bad too, not quite as bad as the other two, but still makes me think of an 83 year old woman. Good luck to you and your family, I hope your kids get cool nicknames at school or something, or maybe go by their middle or last name. And once again, Christ, OP.", "YTA.  Ichabod? Really?  This kid is gonna be catching flack his whole life for that name.  You picked names YOU like with zero regard for the child you gave it to.", "Okay. Seriously? Ichabod? Like Colonel Ichabod Crane, or Disney's rendition of Sleepy Hollow? Seriously?? Did you do any research on these names, and people/characters who hold them??\n\nYeah, YTA.

Obviously it was going to be a very difficult process to have them and raise 3 babies at once but we'd always said we wanted three kids and our wish was granted. The two of us have always loved old fashioned things minus the racism and stuff (my husband is black, I am \"extremely\" white, according to his family, this will be important later). Everything in terms of pregnancy and birth went about as well as they could given I was having 3 kids at once, and we're both very happy that our kids came out healthy and safe. The only thing we've had to really deal with outside of the sheer exhaustion of having three kids running around is that one of our kids is non-verbal, and has been diagnosed with autism. This is no surprise as me and my husband both are autistic and were expecting our kids to inherit that, and we're looking to get the other two screened sometime within the next few months.\nThe one problem however, is that we have someone working with us for early intervention (the triplets turned 2 in October), and she constantly makes jokes about our son's name, no matter how much I or my husband politely ask her not to do that.\nOur son in early intervention is named Ichabod, and our other two kids are named Ulbrich and Winnifred. We took a lot of time choosing these names and believe they're lovely, but my husband's family have also made fun of these names and I'm worried people are just going to keep doing this to us. Their names are beautiful and fit them so well, and I don't understand what the real problem is. They aren't named anything outrageous, just considered \"goofy\" by a lot of people. My husband got very mouthy with the woman working with early intervention about Ichabod's name and calling her a bully, and she said that me and my husband were bullying our kids the moment we named them. I had to leave the room because I was in tears but I just don't know why everyone does this, I've googled it and there's nothing awful associated with the names Ichabod, Ulbrich, or Winnifred.
