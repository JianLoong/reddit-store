April is my best employee hands down, she handles several aspects of the business and is overall an overachiever and extremely smart.  \n\nHowever, April has these weird social issues that sometimes puts me in awkward positions. She absolutely refuses to attend lunch meetings if there is food. She says she has high anxiety when food is involved and can't stand to eat in public places or in front of groups of people.  She claims the mouth noises upset her.  To be clear, she is not in marketing for my company, but the problem is she's the best person I have. She's extremely impressive and I've noticed when she's in the meetings or zoom calls with potential clients she has a way to win them all over vs calls or meetings when she's not there they don't go as well. The other employees are just not as smart or charismatic. Personally I prefer to do lunch meetings because it really relaxes the clients and I enjoy them more. Everyone else in the office agrees and really appreciates having free food, so it's a big thing to do this. \n\nTuesday I had a potential client come in that set up a lunch meeting for today and was dropping off the menu selections for their staff and I took the client into April's office to introduce her. When we came in and the client tried to shake her hand & April just stood there and looked like she may reach out, but then changed her mind and half waved.  It was extremely rude and I could tell it bothered the client. \n\nThen after the client leaves April says not attending. I ask why and she gets all huffy and says \"Because I told you a million times I can't do these lunches.\"  Since I want make her happy, I agree to not bring out the food until after the meeting but unfortunately my daughter had a practice so I arrived late and when I get to the office the food is already out. I go to get April and she refuses to come out, even after I strategized the meeting to revolve around her. I became very flustered and told her she needs to suck it up & get out there & she told me no & says I can write her up if I don't like it. The situation became so hostile my wife had to drag me out of her office because I was ready to fire her then and there.  My wife says I'm in the wrong and I'm the AH, but I feel like April is the one causing the problem and letting us all down. She embarrassed me twice in a week and has not apologized and now putting me in the awkward position of maybe terminating her and having to replace her.

Because she's not going to perform as well under extreme stress. And if you make an issue of this, she's probably smart enough to look for another job. You only have 13 employees, she probably has dozens of potential employers if she's as good as you say. Don't shoot yourself in the foot here.", "Yta. There\u2019s also lots of medical reasons to not be able to be a part of lunch meetings. She could be saving face by saying it\u2019s mouth noises, but in reality she could be in recovery from a eating disorder or have a very specific diet that she has to stick to. \n\nThe fact you\u2019re thinking about laying her off for this without communicating with her makes me think you\u2019re not as good of a boss as you say you are.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s made her boundary clear and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable, if you want her there then schedule meetings that don\u2019t involve food.", "YTA.\n\nShe's not putting you in an awkward position, YOU put you in an awkward position.\n\nPart of being a boss is getting the best out of people. You say how awesome April is, but you want her to be just as awesome in a situation that she has clearly communicated to you that she won't be great in. How are you, as her boss, setting her up for success here?\n\nYou're not. You're creating situations that she will fail in and then acting surprised or upset that she's not performing there. And worse, you're antagonizing her afterwards. Really think about how crazy that is in the long run.\n\nLunch meetings are great, I get it. But if she's your Ace, and it sounds like she is, put her in a situation where she can be at her best.", "YTA - you just said that you consider April your most valuable employee. It sounds like you wouldn't be able to close the deal nearly as much without her. That makes her a \"really big deal\". I just finished a book/memoirs of a woman who had an eating disorder and she mentally couldn't handle eating around other people because it took the focus off of the people she was with because she was overwhelmed around the food.\n\nI'm not saying that that is April's problem, but you never know what people are going through. She has been very clear with you that she doesn't want to have meetings this way but you want to force this situation because *you* like them. In addition to that, it's not April's fault that your daughter had practice and YOU were late, that's a *you* problem!\n\nYou need to value your employees more and listen to what they're telling you or you'll lose your best people. If I was April, I would have walked out that day.", "[removed]", "YTA. She's not in marketing. Presumably, client lunches therefore aren't a part of her job description. She's told you that she cannot and does not wish to participate in these lunches. Why are you trying to force an employee to do something that's not part of their job and which she's repeatedly told you she's not willing to do? Especially when you're strategizing meeting to revolve around her *without apparently telling her about this*?\n\nIf you really want her to be involved in client meetings you need to a) talk to her about her taking on this responsibility, and b) work *with* her to support her in doing this in ways that set her up for success. That's probably going to mean not doing client lunches, or having her in meetings with clients before doing lunch as a separate activity without her there.\n\nAlso, difficulty with certain sounds is often a symptom of various disabilities or disorders (look up misophonia), so you should also note that depending on your local laws, you may be opening yourself up to legal issues with trying to force her into this. Especially if you then fire her for it.", "YTA! You are about to lose your best employee because you don't respect her! How many times has she told you NO!\n\nThere is a very simple solution for your problem. Don't force her to attend lunch meetings!", "Info, am I right in thinking that, other than completely ignoring your employees boundaries, her presence is requested at the meetings so she can do work that's outside of her job description?", "YTA. This almost reminds me of the guy in the news who told his job he did not want a birthday party. The gave him one anyways then fired him for having a panic attack. He is a whole lot richer now. If you keep this up it could come back to haunt you.", "YTA- shes said numerous times shes uncomfortable with those types of meetings due to her anxiety. An frankly she must have sensory issues if the noises is part of the complaint.\n\nYou are acting like such an AH boss if you can't respect her boundaries as a person or an employee. The fact you think its ok to tell her to suck it up is gross to me as someone worh sensory issues as well.\n\ni hope she quits", "YTA.\n\nAre you paying people for working through lunch? Or do they get a separate lunch break before/after?", "YTA. She told you lunch meetings were a NO, but you just refuse to listen or accommodate her (your best, invaluable employee). Employees are entitled to a lunch break - aka time they can spend however they want. \n\nSounds like you need to work on your control issues and appreciate what she brings to your business. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll probably lose her to your competition.", "YTA respect her boundary and quit harassing her just because *you* don\u2019t think her issue is legitimate because *you* personally have never experienced what she does. the only one who owes anyone an apology here is you.", "YTA. This employee has a legitimate issue that she has communicated to you multiple times, likely a disability that requires accomodation. She has established a boundary that you continue to not respect.\n\nI can't wait for you to lose this competent employee to a better employer.", "YTA, look up Misophonia.", "YTA. Do you have brain damage? Your best employee told you she doesn\u2019t ever want to  do lunch meetings. You organized a lunch meeting. Why are you surprised your employee reacted so negatively?", "YTA\n\nShe told you from the beginning she will not do lunch meetings, you understand and agree to this. Then you used your being late as an excuse to try to drag her to one.\n\nShe\u2019s your best employee, accommodate her needs or someone else will", "YTA  \n\n\nI mean you say she's your best and she only has this one exception but you constantly try and force her into a situation she isn't comfortable with. This isn't news to you mate. I'm glad she stood up to you. Is everybody else in your office so incompetent they couldn't be told that food would be served after the meeting?  She sounds like she has some kind of social awkwardness and anxiety but if she's good at her job then get your team to pull their pants up and go beyond in that area where she struggles. How do you run a business? lmao", "YTA\n\nApril told you a million times about her boundaries and you were being an AH overstepping them. You were honestly acting like a child trying to force her out of her comfort zone. Thank god it was your wife that dragged you out of there and no one else.", "YTA. Management involves give and take. She's clearly a very highly valued employee and she deserves some leeway. She's made her boundaries clear and you should respect that. The last thing you want is her to leave because you're putting her in situations she finds uncomfortable, not only because it'd be bad for business but also because it's a dick move.", "YTA\n\nLiterally looks like you can\u2019t do the one thing she asked of you? If she\u2019s as impressive as you says she is, but her boss sets her up to fail, I\u2019d tell her to find a new boss.", "Lmfao YTA frankly it sounds like you need her WAY \nmore than she needs you.\n\nYou have a massive fucking ego and you know your business would suffer without her so why in gods name would you fire her over this? Tbh it sounds like your little dick energy couldn\u2019t handle being told \u201cno\u201d by a woman who\u2019s supposed to be groveling to you \n\nif she\u2019s your best employee stfu and do what\u2019s best for you and let her do her work the way she wants.", "YTA\n\nHave some respect for your employee and their boundaries. It\u2019s is not that hard to not schedule her for a lunch meeting. It\u2019s not her embarrassing you, it is very much the other way around", "Sounds like it could be seen as medical/disability issue that she told you about.  You\u2019re going to fire your best worker because you can\u2019t control her? I hope she sues you and find a better job, Maybe with a competitor. YTA", "First, we've all just lived through a pandemic. I think it's outrageous that you just *expect* your employees to shake hands with people, when not everyone is comfortable with it. Honestly, sounds like she handled that about as well as she could have, so it's very odd that you are counting that as a time when she \"embarrassed\" you. \n\nSecond, if you know that she has an issue with food-related meetings, why the heck are you scheduling your \"best employee\" in circumstances that you know she can't possibly do her best work in? That's just bad management. Not to mention that it's really hard to argue that you \"strategized\" a meeting around her when you couldn't be bothered to ensure that someone was responsible for the food...\n\nBut that is AskaManager.org territory, not AITA. Because at the end of the day, you are the boss and you are allowed to decide how you want to run your business. And just because I think you are making a poor business decision, that's neither here nor there on the AH spectrum\n\nNo, AITA concerns itself with whether one's behavior is AH-ish or not. So let's look at exactly what you did:\n\nYou have known April for years. You know she has a particular issue that causes her distress. You set up a situation--without checking with her--and just expected her to go along with it. She declined. You negotiated with her to get her to agree to do it. You then reneged on the accommodation you had promised her. Unsurprisingly, she decided to pull out. You tried to pressure her, and she declined again, and even preemptively agreed to accept the consequences of her actions (i.e. being written up). You then began to berate her in such a hostile way that you had to be dragged away. And even your *wife* (who surely has an interest in your business) said your behavior was out of line.\n\nYeah, YTA. You don't deserve to have someone as competent and talented as April working for you. If you're looking for advice, I would suggest an apology, a sincere promise never to put her in a situation like that again, and a raise. But if April were looking for advice? I would suggest finding a new job where her talents will be appreciated.", "YTA-April had set one restriction (that you originally were okay with), and you even mention she is by far most valuable. For these reasons, you must accept her limitations to profit from above average ability. And the fact you were ready to fire her cause (essentially) you were late, and dropped the ball, says you should listen to your wife", "YTA. You repeatedly try to get her to do something that you admit isn't even in her job description, that she tells you she cannot do. Be careful if you fire her over this, if it is due to a diagnosed disablity, you could be hit with a lawsuit.", "YTA.   She told you a million times what she needs.  You are lucky to have an employee like her and if this one thing keeps her happy you should be Al for it.  Too bad you didn\u2019t fire her, she deserves better", "YTA - you realize she may have an ED / history of ED??  Just because *you* enjoy eating around strangers, doesn't mean others do.", "YTA - You said yourself that these meetings are not part of her job. You just want her there because she's \"impressive\".\n\nIf that's your strategy you should 1) Pay her additional money to do the job you're forcing on her 2) Provide her with an environment where she can do her best work and be \"impressive\" for your company.\n\nIf you force her into these high anxiety situations you're not going to get the best results from her. She won't perform well.", "YTA, you wanted to fire your best employee over an issue you were aware of before lunch. Why are you trying to make April do something out of her group description? This is a strange post.", "Absolutely the AH. You rely on April far more than she needs to rely on you. She has been very clear about her limitations. You embarrassed yourself. You do not need to do lunch meetings, you want to do them. She can\u2019t do them. You shot yourself in the ass and you\u2019re blaming her. Can you even imagine how horrifying this situation was for April? Start holding your meetings before lunch and then AFTER the meeting take your clients out to lunch. Before you do anything else, apologize and give April a raise.", "YTA. April has some kind of disability. If you need a star performer during lunch time, you need to hire one.", "\ud83d\ude44. C'mon. She's your star. Terminate her, be prepared for unforseen consequences. Yta.", "YTA. She's your best employee. Decide if you want to honor her boundaries/limitations or give her a nice severance package.

Either fire her or accommodate her, your not going to win any clients while she's glaring at the masticating.", "YTA. You put your personal preference above your employee\u2019s clear, manageable and reasonable boundaries. I hope April\u2019s next boss has some respect for her.", "YTA. Sounds like you need her (to do stuff that frankly sounds outside of her role) to make these deals. She isn't comfortable in that environment. She's already going above and beyond and you wanted to sack her?! Please! Take a moment here and recognise that you need her. Promote her, reward her and stop being an idiot. And before you come with, we'll if I promoted her she'd have to do it, go back again and realise all she achieves for your company and your financial bottom line.", "YTA. Good mangers don't just cater to their clients, they cater to their employees as well.  Especially when the employee has made it clear to you that she's uncomfortable with these lunch meetings that revolve around food.\n\nI don't get you. You have the best employee who outshines your other employees, but that's not good enough;  you still want her to concede to all your demands, which are ridiculous. If the only reason you can keep clients is bc of you feeding them, then you likely need April even more than you think.", "YTA. You will lose your best employee because you refuse to change your ways. Lunch meetings are not a requirement. You want to schmooze like the old boys, by all means go for it. Don\u2019t make someone do it who is deeply uncomfortable doing so. Employees will stay if they feel respected. It\u2019s really the bare minimum.", "YTA - BIG TIME. You know you are. She's told you countless times of her issues and you don't care. You're the one that looks bad here not April.", "YTA. As you're aware of her need for an accomodation, firing her could be rightfully expensive for you.", "Yta fire her because you NEED her to talk to a client good luck without her. Also not wanting to do lunch meetings is a valid reason. If you think you can fire her so quickly you should have no problem finding anyone else to deal with your clients during times that involve food you should be apologizing to her.", "YTA - I hope you\u2019re paying these employees for their lunch meetings, most companies expect employees to go unpaid for their breaks. Also, she has expressed many times she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable and has given legitimate reasons for it so yes, you are TA if you force her. Potential clients only love it because they\u2019re getting a free lunch. Seeing people eat can be very off-putting and nauseating, especially when they\u2019re people you wouldn\u2019t choose to be around and socialise with such as your coworkers. How about you suck up the fact not everyone loves your little corporate lunches and she doesn\u2019t want to watch a bunch of middle aged suits stuff their faces while making business deals, sounds gross af and I don\u2019t blame her. She is your best employee so if you fire her then it will be an unfair dismissal and she has every right to go to fair work or your equivalent of it which I hope she does.

I started my company 20 years ago, and hired April 32F 6 yrs ago.  April is my best employee hands down, she handles several aspects of the business and is overall an overachiever and extremely smart.  \n\nHowever, April has these weird social issues that sometimes puts me in awkward positions. She absolutely refuses to attend lunch meetings if there is food. She says she has high anxiety when food is involved and can't stand to eat in public places or in front of groups of people.  She claims the mouth noises upset her.  To be clear, she is not in marketing for my company, but the problem is she's the best person I have. She's extremely impressive and I've noticed when she's in the meetings or zoom calls with potential clients she has a way to win them all over vs calls or meetings when she's not there they don't go as well. The other employees are just not as smart or charismatic. Personally I prefer to do lunch meetings because it really relaxes the clients and I enjoy them more. Everyone else in the office agrees and really appreciates having free food, so it's a big thing to do this. \n\nTuesday I had a potential client come in that set up a lunch meeting for today and was dropping off the menu selections for their staff and I took the client into April's office to introduce her. When we came in and the client tried to shake her hand & April just stood there and looked like she may reach out, but then changed her mind and half waved.

I ask why and she gets all huffy and says \"Because I told you a million times I can't do these lunches.\"  Since I want make her happy, I agree to not bring out the food until after the meeting but unfortunately my daughter had a practice so I arrived late and when I get to the office the food is already out. I go to get April and she refuses to come out, even after I strategized the meeting to revolve around her.

Or have everyone eat and then bring April in after the food has been cleared.  People who are busy eating aren't really listening to presentations anyway.

Either accept her conditions, based on her value, or replace her. But stop blaming her for your choices.", "YTA but go ahead and fire her. I'm sure she'll do as well or better elsewhere. You'll be shooting yourself in the foot over a non-issue.  You could have lunch with the clients and then have them meet with April. You could have them meet with April first and then go eat lunch. You could work around this, you just won't because you think things should be how you want them to be. That's not how you keep good employees.", "Since this is currently the top rated comment, I would like to point out that April probably has misophonia. It is a disorder (that is usually an accompaniment to other mental health disorders) that makes the person who is it sensitive to sound. Things that sound normal or even pleasant to most people (ie chewing/swallowing food or drink, teeth clicking, breathing, tooth sucking, throat clearing, coughing, humming, gum snapping etc) sound like nails on a chalk board. But worse. It can trigger feelings of unreasonable rage to the point of wanting to mock, berate or even hurt the offending noise maker; or similarly can trigger anxiety attacks, literal panic \u201cI have to get out of this room or I might actually die\u201d like feelings. \n\nFor me, I get both. I have to remove myself as quickly as possible (sometimes, I\u2019m aware, I come off as rude or like there is something urgently wrong.) for fear of lashing out. It\u2019s a primal feeling of fear and anger that I do not like having. The tv must be on or something else loud enough to cover up everyone\u2019s eating noises must be happening to avoid this feeling. I can barely stand the sound of myself eating honestly. \n\nIt\u2019s torturous to have this disorder tbh. \n\nOp YTA\n\nr/misophonia probably has an informational that\u2019s better than mine also", "Frankly, I think April could do better and I hope that she finds a better job.", "April apparently does better with clients than Op\u2026and yet OP is insisting they be the relaxed one!  No man! You want your star player happy and relaxed. JFC. Take the clients out for drinks later, to seal the deal.", "I was thinking the same thing. You promised that lunch would be served afterward, and then YOU were late.\n\nI agree with everyone else, YTA.", "Especially as she has communicated numerous times why she doesn't want to participate in lunch meetings, so this isn't a surprise, and he's embarrassed because he's tried to force her to do things that don't make her feel comfortable, but is blaming her.", "Thank you! I have gastric issues that; when triggered, are so severe I will spend the rest of the day vomiting in the bathroom. Sometimes it\u2019s something as benign as salad dressing that\u2019s too oily.  \n\nAt my last job they had lunch catered in twice a week.  It was a wink and a nod that we were expected to work without taking a lunch those two days.  However the manager in charge of the ordering was mentally still in the frat house so it was a rotation of pizza, wings, and barbecue.  I kept protein shakes in the break room fridge (ensure, so nobody wanted to steal them) for those days.  It didn\u2019t take long before rumors got started that I had an eating disorder.  \n\nThe rumor turned into a whole thing. HR scheduled a meeting with me and also blocked off the big conference room.  I was convinced I was getting fired.  Instead I walked into an intervention.  They had a rep there from an eating disorder clinic that worked with our EAP program and plane tickets.  Some people cannot accept that no is a complete sentence.", "Let's not forget, this isn't her job.

Just giving another possible reason why someone might opt out of food events", "This. I have a sensory food disorder (ARFID) and before I started eating an extreme carnivore diet, it would lead me to have extreme issues with anything involving food because trying to explain to people why I couldn\u2019t eat certain thing when it\u2019s not an allergy is legitimately exhausting. \n\nYou know the people who can only eat meat or chicken tenders\u2026 yeah that\u2019s the more extreme of what I have but I can\u2019t eat fruits or veggies. People get so weird when I used to say that but didn\u2019t know it was a real disorder or had a name. Instead I would just get called picky or childish.

I have it too. A part of me realizes that my sudden fury in re: to other people chewing/swallowing is illogical and baseless, but there\u2019s not much to be done except leave or turn on music or something. \n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing to deal with because I\u2019m normally pretty laid back, so to go from chill to enraged to being fine once I can\u2019t hear it anymore feels odd.", "I agree on the misophonia, also have it. She is aware of the problem and has let you know she cannot be in environments where it will likely be triggered. Once triggered, it's a fight or flight situation. It's also embarrassing to explain to people who don't have it as many tend to dismiss it as a general annoyance that  you should just be able to 'deal with'. Someone with misophonia cannot just deal with it. Apologize and do better by you best emplyee.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.", "So not only is he a jerk, he's also violating the ADA because not forcing April to be present for the lunch portion of the meeting is a reasonable accommodation.\n\nIt's probably his imagination that the clients love the lunch meetings.", "Pretty sure I have it too. Most of my coworkers and my bosses are extremely loud eaters, I just hate the sounds of people eating loudly and breathing heavily.

I thought my reaction to all the adverts where food cooking and such was just my weirdness.", "...to celebrate closing a deal? Doesn't that actually make more sense?", "Yep. The sound of people eating is disgusting and enraging. I can\u2019t deal with it, and I do everything in my power not to have to go to meetings or functions when there is going to be food served. \n\nAnd no, ignoring the noises doesn\u2019t work. You can\u2019t ignore them. The harder you try, the worse it gets.", "I forgot he'd mentioned that. So literally not her job", "I love the metaphor", "YTA mandatory lunch meetings are the fuckin worst. It's the only break people get away from each other and you take it away.", "So, wait, they don't actually get a lunch BREAK?", "Your the toxic boss. Are you willing to lose you best employee over this ?", "So to be clear, you don't actually give your employees a (required by law) break AND you lack the skills or talent to do the job yourself so you decided the best course of action was to purposely alienate and yell at the one person who actually does?  Cause that doesn't seem legal or smart.  Is fighting wrongful termination lawsuits like your hobby or something?\n\nYTA", "I can't wait for a regulatory committee to hear that", "So you're not only an asshole, you're also a criminal", "People like to use lunches to *not work* and relax. You say she\u2019s one of your best workers and a staple to the small company yet you want to set her in unfavorable positions that even your wife says you\u2019re an AH. \nYou should apologize and try to compromise to make the best of the meeting plus pay her more for doing even more work", "Because of labor laws. Man you are a horrible boss", "I hope you get sued", "That\u2019s illegal.", "Wait you are making employees work during their only lunch ? What a horrible boss lmao.", "All I can think is...so her misophonia has to be at about the same level as or a little worse than mine; I excuse myself to another room when people are eating, because I don't want to feel like murdering them. If trapped in a room with multiple people who are eating, I can be driven into basically an anxiety attack. There is no filtering it out; there is no ignoring it; it is very awful.\n\nYou're very lucky, though, that her misophonia doesn't seem to be as bad as that of a friend of mine, who will literally uncontrollably vomit when in that situation.", "Who honestly cares about a free lunch? I'd rather pay for my own lunch and have a break from my job in the middle of the day and I think I'm probably in the majority feeling that way. Not only are you trying to deny her the ability to spend her lunch break doing her own thing, you're actively adding stress to her plate by putting her into a situation she's repeatedly told you makes her uncomfortable *specifically because it involves lunch*. She obviously doesn't consider the free lunch a perk.\n\nAlso a lot of people don't shake hands anymore. Especially post-Covid. If she was otherwise polite and respectful I don't see why it's an issue.", "So the answers to the 2 questions are yes and yes. You are lucky she has put up with your shot attitude as long as she has. Also you said you wouldn\u2019t have the food out for the meeting to try and accommodate her and then magically pull an excuse out of your ass for why you couldn\u2019t do it but then still expect her to do something that\u2019s not her job even tho you couldn\u2019t do the bare minimum on your end as the boss.
