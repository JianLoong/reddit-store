I say if someone takes a swipe at me, kick them back, knock them down, then kick them some more.

Dealt a tough hand, had a chance to mostly avoid the negative effects by finishing school with her grandparents, but made a terrible decision at a young age that led to an escalating series of increasingly terrible decisions.

It\u2019s the truth right? So who cares if the little girl hears it or starts to catch on that that\u2019s how we feel?\n\nJust because something may be true, doesn\u2019t mean we have to say it. Especially when the one who suffers most in that case, would be the kid, who had nothing to do with any of this.

Who cares about that mistake anyway, right?", "Not to mention calling the procedure \"innecessary\" when a pregnancy for OP could be life threatening.

She is protecting a little girl that hasn't exited in a decade, and who attacked you for simply living. \n\nFuck N.

Besides, you think the kid isn't going to figure that out? Her mom clearly didn't want her, maybe even still doesn't. You really think the kid isn't gonna pick up on that?", "Before or after divorce lol", "There\u2019s a line?! \n\nBut yeah gotta agree here, the kid wasn\u2019t present, and the cousin is already projecting her resentment for her kid onto others, only a matter of time until the kid picks up on it too.
