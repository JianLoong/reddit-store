After having multiple conversations with my mother she and dad agreed to help me cover the cost of a tubal ligation. My parents were away the day I was in surgery and I asked my grandma if I could stay at her place for a couple of days while I recovered.

She's bitter but that doesn't mean she gets to take it out on you. The only thing I'd say is this. She didn't know why you had the surgery as far as we know. If she doesn't have context then all that's coming out of her mouth is criticism out of frustration in a situation she doesn't understand.

If she's upset and unhappy that has nothing to do with op who is NTA and just replied to what was said to them...", "OP did kick her when she is down- because the cousin tried to kick her while she is down from surgery for a condition that has no person to blame. I say if someone takes a swipe at me, kick them back, knock them down, then kick them some more. Let that be a reminder for that big mouth to STFU.\n\nAlso, the cousin is raising a child she doesn't want. The cousin herself described a child a \"the consequences\" and OP being \"lucky\".", "Yup, nailed it. Dealt a tough hand, had a chance to mostly avoid the negative effects by finishing school with her grandparents, but made a terrible decision at a young age that led to an escalating series of increasingly terrible decisions. Now she\u2019s bitter and lashing out at OP when she\u2019s really angry at her own life. She\u2019s not even blaming everybody else here, she\u2019s just bitter anybody else has it better. \n\nOn the plus side, at least her BF is working a bunch of jobs and they\u2019re trying to make it work rather than just sitting around, splitting up, and going nowhere. It\u2019ll be a tough, long road, but at least they have a chance.\n\nShe should get a job if grandma is willing to watch the kid even a handful of hours a week, make ends meet much easier", "> but it feels a bit like kicking someone when they\u2019re down.\n\nOp is litterally on bedrest after having had surgery. \n\nIf anything she's kicking up after someone tried to kick her while she was down. Go op.", "I didn\u2019t say OP was an asshole. Idk, I just feel like dragging the kid into it was a bit much. The kid is innocent in this and calling her unwanted (even if cousin was rude first) just kind of bothers me.\n\nBut I get what you\u2019re saying.", "Well if we all believe the kid is a mistake and unwanted then why don\u2019t we all just start saying that? It\u2019s the truth right? So who cares if the little girl hears it or starts to catch on that that\u2019s how we feel?\n\nJust because something may be true, doesn\u2019t mean we have to say it. Especially when the one who suffers most in that case, would be the kid, who had nothing to do with any of this. Yeah, she really \u201cswiped\u201d her cousin good, but she also took a swipe at a little girl. But hey? Who cares about that mistake anyway, right?", "Not to mention calling the procedure \"innecessary\" when a pregnancy for OP could be life threatening. That part would have pushed me over the edge of giving a less than kind reply.", "I don't think she would've, except N brought up \"whoring around without the consequences\" based on what op wrote it sounds like N was projecting hard, the topic was brought up by her.", "What do you mean? Empathy on Reddit? Get outta here, if someone\u2019s an ass you can do what you want to them didn\u2019t you know!", "Did the kid hear it? No? Oh well, then. Kid's unwanted and a mistake. Welcome to the shitshow, junior. Line forms in the back."]}
