Mom said years later that she wanted us to be close to or on the toilet if it turned out to be more than a fart. YTA, because most furniture will smell like the ghosts of your farts over time unless you put down protection covers. No one wants to come sit in the ghosts of your farts. \n\nMy 3rd husband is the only partner who thinks it's ok to deliberately fart outside the bathroom. I lost that battle and keep covers on all the furniture. They get changed out to the company covers when company is at the door.", "At least go to another room and blast one out.

I'll excuse myself to the restroom, take out the garbage, just run back to the bedroom for no reason. Of course it happens accidentally from time to time.  \n\nI know it's weird to some people, but I just believe that there should be *some* mystery in a relationship.  We don't use the toilet (1 or 2) while the other is in the bathroom.  I don't let him watch me grooming (shaving, tweezing, waxing - putting on my make up or fixing my hair not included .... there's only so much time in the morning to get ready before we have to head out the door).  It's a personal preference and it works for us \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA for your question of refusing to fart on the toilet specifically.  \n\nBut really, is it to hard for you to make an effort to move away from him before you let it rip?  Ok, it doesn\u2019t bother you, but he has told you he hates it.  You live in the house together.  It just seems to be common courtesy to not subject your loved ones to your noxious gasses.  Yes, I know sometimes it can\u2019t be helped.  Quick, surprise farts happen.  But if you have advance warning, why would you stand there and let it loose in front of him? I really don\u2019t understand this.  \n \nYou said he feels you should \u201cgo to the toilet\u201d to fart.  I read that as he wants you to go into the bathroom.  That is a totally understandable request.  If you know it\u2019s coming and can remove yourself to the room specifically made for stinky bodily functions, why wouldn\u2019t you?  Or move away from him.  You later say \u201con the toilet\u201d.    Either way, I think he would be happier if you took your farts elsewhere when possible. \n\nIs the Fart Hill really the one you want to die on?", "Soft YTA\n\nBecause it\u2019s IS perfectly okay to be as stinky as you want in your home, buuuut your SO doesn\u2019t like it/grossed out so you shouldn\u2019t just be making him listen to/or smell your farts. Or ya\u2019ll need to compromise somehow. \n\nWe kept our farts in for the longest time when we first started dating. I forget when it stopped. We\u2019re active farting machines now. I hold the record for the stinkiest fart.", "I think it\u2019s a bathroom issue. My stepdad used to fart in the house wherever he pleased .. and it was so disgusting it made me want to throw up. To this day I feel like people should go to the bathroom in the bathroom. If it bothers him why would you force him to endure your bowls ?? It\u2019s disgusting. It smells inappropriate.", "When people are living together it works out better if they adjust to the higher standard. Example: tidiness. The slob should make an effort to not leave their stuff around. Because when you love the other person (or you know, just want to live in harmony) you respect their boundaries.\nYou are mocking his boundary and willing to put zero effort to try to accommodate him.\nYTA\nAlso stupid because it wouldn't cost you much to let go of some of those farts when you are peeing, or go to another room for a second and you'd earn some goodwill from your partner instead of antagonizing him. You can also have preferences that the majority of the population disregards - you'd still want him to not mock you for it or not irritate you on purpose.", "Personally I think in the privacy of your own home, a fart where you are standing or sitting is fine. But - your partner does not feel like this. And if it upset my husband I would go and fart out of his presence (if it was a containable one). So YTA in my opinion if you continue to do it and it upsets him.", "If I farted exclusively on the toilet, I'd spend half my day in the bathroom thanks to my IBS and Crohn's Disease.", "NTA as relationships are about compromise. I personally would rather go fart in the toilet as sitting in my own arse funk is bad enough. As a bloke I have never understood why other blokes think it\u2019s so funny at poker games when so sat smelling someone else\u2019s arse for 10 minutes. So I out of kindness for anyone else that\u2019s about tend to fart when I am taking a piss. I don\u2019t think he is out of order for asking if he does not subject you to his but I don\u2019t know that I would call you an asshole for not respecting his wishes.", "Sorry but he's being a bit unreasonable here because it's not something you can physically control really?? Okay, he can, great, cool, good for him. Doesn't mean you or anyone else can. NTA, just apologise for farting like everyone else does. I was also told to fart on the toilet, but it was always a joke, I was never taught to do it as a kid so... I don't.

That when you live with others , you should be considerate. I have friends who think even that is weird.", "NTA. Lol what?!   I mean try to go to the bathroom or other room but you gotta go you gotta go.", "No,  it's not cool to fart all over the place when you are with others.    For the same reason you don't just shit in a bucket in the living room.    It creates a nasty environment for those around you.", "NTA - you can't run to the toilet every time you pass gas.", "This dude farts in a toilet?", "My daughter has limited me to 3 farts a day before I get pinched. Her mother is allowed 5 per day and I believe it is unfair.", "NTA fart when you need to like a normal person lol. moving away from someone so you\u2019re not farting *on* them is one thing but going to the bathroom each time is overkill", "Bro, you've got some explaining to do, what the hell is your deal with farts?", "Bullshit. Sitting on the toilet to fart is objectively wrong.", "poo particles. do you walk around naked in your house? also, i doubt OP is putting her partner to her ass and letting it rip to be funny. have you never just sat on your couch and felt a fart coming.... and then let it out? i think even in relationships one should be able to afford that luxury unless the fart feels like its about to be vile.", "Don't say no one. You don't know shit.", "At work, in a meeting, do you just let one rip? Can you hold your shit in either?", "It's considered impolite by some people, and few people like the smell of farts. \n\nThat's why it's uncommon to have people let one rip in professional settings. \n\nIt's just one of those things.

It's something that bothers him. Why shouldn't she accommodate something so simple? I feel like if this was the opposite way around, people would feel different. \n\nIt's not a crazy demand. It's a simply boundary. If she loves him, it's not a difficult one to accept.

We decided at the start that we respect each other too much to expose our bowel air to each other. We go to the toilet or hold it in until we can leave the room.

I was on my period (we girls know about how badly our cycles can mess with our system!) In the middle of the winter and Im driving so I control the window locks and he can't pull over. I let loose a SBD and waited. It took about 6 seconds but I knew exactly when it hit him because the look on his face was struck with pure horror. He also had the bad habit of mouth breathing and since he was kinda zoning out on the scenery he was relaxed so his mouth was slightly open. Then he lunged at the door and smashed the button to roll down the window but I had locked it so no luck. Then the turns towards me to say something but he started dry heaving instead. He's wretching with tears leaking out his eyes and he manages to gasp \"pull over\" and folks, even though I had planned on denying that request, the truth is I was laughing so hard I was probably a danger to other drivers and I was pretty sure I was going to piss myself so I needed to pull over as much as he did by then. \n\nOh he was mad. But he never, in the rest of the time we were together, tried pulling something like that again. I got my point across!

Meanwhile her husband refused to believe she couldn't help it and wasn't doing it deliberately so they ended up splitting up. When it got so bad she was rushed to A&E and finally got it diagnosed, her ex said he was really sorry and could they get back together.
