{"id": 31042, "submission_id": "17w3e9z", "title": "AITA for hiding family heirlooms when my family visits?", "selftext": "I (42 F) am one of five children, and my father died when we were very young leaving my mom and my four siblings. \n\nMy parents had collected a lot of cool things over the years. When my mom downsized to a condo after all the kids had left home, she got rid of a lot of items that she no longer had room for. We all had things that we were sentimental about and as one of the younger siblings I didn't request anything although I had strong connections to a few items.\n\nAfter everyone had decided on what they wanted I wound up with three things that were of little to no financial value, but I treasure them for the memories they represent. \n\nThe first item is a tractor seat that is bolted to a butcher block to make a funky chair. The second item is a 1970s tacky spice cabinet, and the third thing is a set of stoneware pastry bowls that my mom had saved green stamps to buy.  \n\nOver the years my siblings have sold, destroyed, or lost the items that they got. And now, when they come to my house, they often comment on the things I have \"I didn't know you got those\", \"I've always wanted that\", etc. \n\nMy mom even told my sister behind my back that she could have tractor seat chair that I had because \"I wasn't really using it\". My mom saw that I had it in the garage because I was protecting it from the weather and it needed sanding. \n\nFor other reasons, I have gone no contact with this sister. Well, she texted me out of the blue to ask if she could have the chair. I told her it was sentimental for me and I would prefer to keep it. She tried to guilt trip me about how she didn't have anything left from our parents. I didn't reply, conversation over.\n\nI also knew that if she had it, it would likely be ruined since she is a bit of a hoarder and doesn't take care of things. She has let a flooding basement go on unresolved for years and her entire house smells like mildew. So bad that I can smell it on her whenever I'm around her. She refuses to acknowledge there is a problem.\n\nShortly after the text exchange, my mom came to house-sit for one night, and I hid the chair in question because I was worried she was going to have my sister come over and grab it, or take it for her.\n\nThen again recently, my mom asked me if she could have the spice rack to give to my sister. I said that I was using it, which is true. We will be hosting Christmas this year and I plan to hide the bowls, the chair, and the spice rack while my family is visiting. \n\nI'm starting to feel like I don't really want anything to do with my family at all, including the heirlooms. I'm not someone who is generally attached to things, especially when it starts to affect a relationship, but I feel on principle this is about more than the heirlooms and more about boundaries.\n\nI feel bad about hiding things, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1700081403, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w3e9z/aita_for_hiding_family_heirlooms_when_my_family/", "score": 703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have gone the extreme opposite to minimalism and only hold on to things that have sentimental value, or usefulnes.", "NTA. I suspect you are correct that the boundary about these items not being up for their grabs is more important than the items themselves. By not caving in to their pressure, you may also avoid future guilt-trips on what they want from you (time, attention, effort, money) because you've not given in on this issue. It's usually the most difficult to set a standard initially, especially since you were passive about inheriting items in the first place and accepted the leftovers. But the more often you give in \"to keep the peace,\" the less peace you will have because they won't stop grabbing.", "This is the key paragraph right here.

Airtags and nanny cans are your friends.", "Just realized you might mean that that's what she would say to me after stealing them!", "Oh yes, we have been working on this home since April. Every room is hoarded, and the only reason they finally called me is because they had a burst pipe (typical in hoarded homes) and the insurance adjuster refused to come in the home.

They're super cheap, like twenty bucks for five. Pure lifesavers when kleptomaniac family visits.", "That was my thought, take them to a friend's house temporarily.  And before you move them back in,  have the locks changed and don't give your family the extra keys.   They should have taken better care of the items they had initially received.", "That\u2019s my thinking as well!

It can boggle the mind, but that's why it can be an actual mental health condition that requires treatment.", "Are you in r/ChildofHoarder ?there would be plenty of understanding for you, and maybe some helpful advice there too", "Oh man that comment does add some good context tho. You literally tried to appeasement, see that went for Great Britain with Hitler. They will never stop.", "Hopefully they don't have animals too! We are very glad that my mom never had any pets.", "Ohhhhhhh yes, they have 4 dogs that piss on EVERYTHING, one of which bites, as well as 2 cats. I've sent the biter flying a couple of times when he came running at me. It's a one-eyed Chihuahua of all things. I told the client that if it bites my partner or I that will be his last day to draw breath.", "Does your sister with the mildew house have kids? If so that\u2019s really dangerous for them and she\u2019s refusing to do anything about it", "Oh no, that's really sad!", "The pets are well cared for, all rescues with some issue or another. I love animals, generally more than people, but that little one eyed pirate is a piece of work!"]}
