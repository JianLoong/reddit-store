{"id": 6157, "submission_id": "1006vv4", "title": "AITA for calling out my school's racist homecoming?", "selftext": "For some context, I recently started highschool at a STEM-based school.  I joined the student council and our first task was planning the homecoming dance. We suggested themes and voted on them, and a few weeks later it was announced that the 'beach' theme had won.\n\nOnly, that's not what they were calling it.\n\nNow, I would've been fine with a beach theme even though it's not what I voted for.  Honestly, it was a smart move choosing a beach theme since we already had the decorations.  What pissed me off was that they were calling it an 'Island Luau.'  None of the people on student council are Polynesian, myself included.  I alerted one of the teachers supervising that this might not be a good idea as it could be considered cultural appropriation, but I was ignored.  I spoke to my friends about how I didn't feel comfortable with them using Hawaiian culture as a theme, but no one started speaking about it.  I decided not to go to the dance and tried to get others not to by posting on Snapchat and Instagram about how harmful these casual instances of cultural appropriation can be and I cited an article on the subject ('More Than A Night of Harmless Fun: Hawaiian Cultural Appropriation' by Erica Lee and Melissa Gan on The Sheaf).  \n\nI was met with an overwhelming amount of hate and negativity, being told I was 'just doing it for attention' and I'm 'too sensitive.'\n\nFor clarification: I never wanted them to completely cancel the homecoming.  We deserve a dance.  All I wanted was for them to not call it a luau and not pass out any plastic leis.  I spoke to the teachers and school counselor about this and all of them refused to change anything, saying it was too late to make any changes (there was still about a month until the dance).  Posters, tickets, and other promotional items had already been created and I wasn't asking them to take them down and make new ones.  It wouldn't have done anything; everyone already knew what the dance was originally called.  I literally only wanted them to make a short announcement on the school's Google Classroom saying, going forward, it would be referred to as 'beach night' or something.  They refused.\n\nAfter the posts on Snapchat and Instagram, I got multiple threats.  When I went to school on Monday (this had happened over the weekend), I found out about 17 kids said they were going to 'jump' me.  I lost a ton of 'friends' over this and I now cannot walk through the halls of my school without kids yelling stuff at me.  I can't eat lunch without kids coming up to me thinking they're being funny by asking me what my thoughts on cultural appropriation are.\n\nI genuinely do not believe I was in the wrong but I know that I cannot accurately judge myself, so I came here.

Calling a dance a luau isn't doing anything to harm Hawaii. If you want to help protect Hawaiian culture, you'd be better off protesting and bringing attention to actual threats to the Hawaiian islands and culture -- such as, the rampant tourist business that's eating up clean water and polluting the area -- than protesting the name of your school's dance.\n\nThere's also the point where cultural appropriation and appreciation intersect, that I think a lot of young activists don't get. If you've recently started high school then you're quite young. And you say yourself that you aren't Polynesian or anything else. It just reminds me of some old viral posts where white girls had worn Indian style dresses to their Indian friends' weddings and then been insulted online, before actual Indian people pointed out that it was lovely of them to partake, actually.", "The white saviour complex is big with this one....YTA", "INFO: Are there any Polynesian people in your school at all?

And that group does not include you.", "Oh, for crying out loud. Yes, YTA.\n\nHawaiian culture will survive someone doing a less-than-100% authentic luau outside of Hawai'i. (A scholarly article by an academic ideologue does not change this fact.) And yes, it's OK if some white guys in Seattle (or wherever) decide to make tacos or bahn mi. Shockingly, cultures interact with, and borrow culinary and other traditions from, each other.\n\nWhile your classmates are absolutely wrong in threatening to \"jump\" you or otherwise react violently, I'm glad you're getting pushback from the more reasonable ones.\n\nPlease revisit your overly stringent ideology.

I assume they're serving Hawaiian or Polynesian cuisine.  Much like if they were serving Tex-Mex and called it a fiesta or had a Swedish buffet and said we're hosting a smorgasbord.  It's a term appropriate to describe the cuisine being served and the music /entertainment.", "NTA. As one of the only natives so far commenting (and still not speaking FoR aLl PeOple) its a fair thing to bring up. Its brought up a lot in my family/circles since always. Like, I'm not ~mad or ~offended, but you are pointing out the lack of poly involvement. Sure, culture is meant to be shared and appreciated- never sure how that plays when no one it 'belongs' to is sharing, and comically ripping off things isnt appreciation. And sure, its not meant to be authentic or whatever, but thats all the more reason to yknow... not do it, too, when the more generic \"beach\" theme is there. Plastic leis and grass skirt table runners and crappy tiki shit... enjoy your party city bullshit, by all means, its meant to be a party! Tacky, worthless, but culture as a decoration can still be fun for people and thats the point for dances.\n\nIts a losing battle and while you did what felt right by speaking up, even when I'm in these situations (2019 my hospital system threw a luau for our christmas party), its really just an eyeroll situation. Pointless to try to explain yourself to people who arent interested in respecting/understanding others. Good on you calling it when you see it.", "YTA. You're trying to frame this like you're the poor, single anti-racist in the middle of so many terrible, unfeeling racists, but your actions show that you did what you did for internet brownie points (like this post, too) instead of actually caring about what was going on.\n\nYou start by saying that you joined the student council and make it clear that all of you on your student council are white... and then very quickly talk about how \"they\" decided to name it \"Island Luau,\" suddenly dropping all responsibility. Instead of speaking up in the student council meeting - because if you did, you would have said so - you talked to one teacher who didn't give a response, and then you only talked to your friends about \"discomfort\" instead of having a full discussion.\n\nThen, you ran to social media to try and make yourself look good to whoever was on there, because call-outs on social media give social credit on social media.\n\nTime obviously passed, and the staff would have put in a fair amount of money into the dance and promotional materials. They're not going to put that to waste, and budgets are important. \n\nThe real issue here is that you didn't speak up with what you believed to be right at the student council, but instead went around with teachers instead, which would have made you look absolutely ridiculous to your peers. You say you didn't want the dance cancelled, but going online to try and make others not attend is you trying to basically cancel the event, and students aren't ever going to take kindly to another student trying to ruin a dance. \n\nThe real world isn't Twitter. The real world needs kindness and communication and sharing of thoughts. \n\nIf you have actual principles, you need to stand up for them in the real world. You have to talk to your peers and get your point across, not circumvent them by getting teachers involved instead, or try to look good online. You also have to realise that there are consequences for your actions in the real world, and in the real world, there's no baying online mob that parrot whatever's currently fashionable to back you up. \n\nObviously you don't deserve any kind of violence, but you're going to have to suck up the taunts about cultural appropriation now, because the way you went about this makes you look like the tons of other attention-seekers who pretend to care about social justice for some kind of clout. It'll be a valuable lesson going forward. Actual fights for social justice are hard. They always have been and always will be.", "The response you're getting is primarily from a bunch of people who don't even believe in appropriation in the first place. I would say that this is a poor place to ask this question, as most questions that have to do with cultural insensitivity get shut down fast.\n\nI took a peek at r/Hawaii and it seems like, while it's not the best theme, a lot of people just don't care and as long as it's not filled with offensive stereotypes it's whatever. They don't seem to give a shit about Hawaiian shirts as those have nothing to do with Hawaiian culture. Or plastic leis, which do have something to do with the culture but it's like fine. I've heard \"hula skirts\" are a gross mockery of the actual thing though. A luau is a type of party, after all, and it's not like a closed practice or cultural ceremony. \n\nI sympathize with you, though. If somebody started hosting a native American themed party with cultural stereotypes I would be upset, too.", "YTA \n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t have the faintest clue is\u2026.well\u2026..cluelessness on steroids.", "There's cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation.\n\nAs long as no one was using it to make jokes or treat anyone like shit, I don't really see an issue. \n\nSoft YTA. You were trying to come from a good place. But saying only a certain group of people are allowed to do a thing that was being done (hopefully) tastefully isn't an issue. \n\nHonestly. If more people took the time to appreciate other cultural practices, we wouldn't have half the racist shit that we actually have. Culture should be shared with all, not horded away. That's how we grow and learn to accept other people's and practices. \n\nPick your battles better from now on. You're young and have a lot to learn. Use this as a learning experience.", "NTA, especially considering you\u2019re receiving physical threats from other students over this? like c\u2019mon. i know this is reddit and we can\u2019t expect the most nuanced responses, but you\u2019re a teenager navigating complex social issues for the first time. there\u2019s no need for this dogpiling. i\u2019m also not sure where anyone would get the idea that what will likely be a cheap party city knockoff of an important cultural tradition is in any way an \u201cappreciation\u201d if that culture. have y\u2019all been to a high school dance before? they\u2019re not exactly educational. \n\nregardless, the point of any educational institution should in part be to facilitate and explore discussions such as these. the staff at your school rejected what could have been some very valuable teaching moments for you and your peers because it was easier for them to ignore your questions, and now they are neglecting the responsibility they have to facilitate a safe learning environment for all of their students by allowing your peers to harass and threaten you. i\u2019m very sorry that you\u2019re having to deal with this. know, at least, that you are developing a strong moral backbone and voice that will serve you well in life. to not acquiesce under that level of peer pressure takes a lot of fortitude, and i commend you for it. hope it gets easier soon!", "NTA. You were right. Using a cultural event from a culture to which none of the organizers belong as a theme for a party is appropriation. You even cited an article that supports your position.\n\nCultural appreciation would be attending a luau hosted by Hawaiian people. Using Hawaiian culture as an aesthetic is appropriation and just gross. \n\nI am so sorry your school is so full of assholes who refuse to acknowledge their biases.", "Sigh. Unpopular but NTA. Imma be downvoted like hell lol\n\nI get where you were coming from but I don\u2019t think it was inherently racist to use that name for the event. I don\u2019t get how ppl in the comments are calling this cultural appreciation bc it clearly isn\u2019t but it isn\u2019t appropriation either; it\u2019s just borrowing? But I can also see the appropriation part bc if no one is Polynesian/Hawaiian then borrowing their culture without actually celebrating any actual part of the culture can really trivialize it making it seem like \u201coh it\u2019s just a theme\u201d and a domino effect can occur. \n\nHonestly, the AH were the ones threatening you and calling you sensitive. I don\u2019t think the white savior applies to you, though I can see how it can but white savior is slightly different from this. \nEither way, I know you approached the situation with good intentions.", "NTA. You came to the wrong place to discuss culture and race. The majority of people in this space are not knowledgeable on those subjects. It was brave of you to speak up and try to get a more respectful theme. Good luck to you.", "NTA.  But asking *reddit* of all places if you were right, for calling out racism, was always going to be a losing battle.  This place is a cesspool, at the best of times.  AITA\u2019s one of the worst, too.\n\nYou were right.  Full stop.  Your school's full of racist assholes who don't like the idea of consequences.  Which, of course, means they didn't like you calling them out.  That's not your fault, tough.", "Of all the petty nonsense! \n\nOf course YTA.  There is a difference between appreciating/celebrating other cultures and legitimate cultural appropriation.  Stop looking for reasons to be offended.", "You ATAH, stop being so offended.

My father grew up on res for 12 years then on a ranch and lived the \u201ccowboy\u201d life and the whole cliche isn\u2019t even truth. \n\nWhite kids can dress up as a character who isn\u2019t white, just like POC can dress up like Elsa, or Queen Elizabeth if they want. But dressing up as a culture to be festive is problematic. Holidays like cinco de mayo are problematic. Go to a cinco party where it\u2019s mostly white people who voted for trump. Ask them why may 5th is a holiday. They can\u2019t tell you.\n\nCultural appropriation is the use or theft of a culture in a way that mocks, or doesn\u2019t fit the purpose. Or causes people or companies not from that culture to profit. Get Hawaiian themed party stuff from party city? Guess what, you\u2019re appropriating their culture for your bbq. You\u2019re not even serving Hawaiian food probably. Just adding pineapple possibly.", "I dont think this is the right place to ask this. Because most people that will respond don't have the connection to truly make the decision on how this should be viewed- imo. Though, they can show you have majority of people will feel, but I think the fact that already most of your school responded poorly already shows that. Honestly to me, the only people who can truly tell you if it is offensive or not are those that would have connections to the event. Considering the few people in the comments that have claimed to have connections to the culture involved are saying n t a. I lean towards that being what you should listen to. However you do need to understand, that sometimes doing right by some, will get you labeled an ah by others. Especially in situations like this where it sounds like you may be ahead of the times foe the people you know. It's about like years ago dressing as a Native American for Halloween was considered normal and acceptable.  Did it make it right? No. But general opinion was there was nothing wrong with it. We've come far enough now to see the issues. I feel like this may be one of those situations. Where years from now majority will probably agree with this, but at this moment too many people will feel it's being too sensitive- Especially since you don't have any connection to the culture yourself, so it's easy to accuse you of being a white savior. I think for a true idea on whether you were right you probably need to find a group with connections to luaus, and ask them, how they feel about the topic.", "Dude. No. You are not the ah. I am so sorry about the response so far. I have been you-trying to help my (white) classmates understand they should not be dressing up in blackface to sing Diana Ross covers. I have also been the classmate to those who have lost their scholarships for dressing up for \u201cPolynesian party\u201d just-you are doing great. Don\u2019t doubt yourself based on this wackadoodle Reddit response!!!! You are right and friend keep that same energy", "YTA. This isnt stealing culture. What are you, the fun police?", "NTA \n\nBlows my mind that there's so many comments here saying that it's \"not a big deal\". Organising a homecoming and then re-naming it a luau to make a beach theme more exciting is not \"cultural appreciation\", it's straight up appropriation. You're right, it is racist.\n\nGood on you for speaking up - it's hard to go against your peers, especially at your age, and speaking to a teacher is often a good idea if you're not sure about how to bring something up. It might be worth looking into joining a youth chapter of an anti-racism organisation - it can be pretty exhausting trying to change things solo, and it may be good to be able to talk to older mentors about racism and how best to challenge it, if that's something you are passionate about.", "NTA. Of course you're not wrong, but it seems like you maybe from an area that does not take such issues seriously. It's pretty sad that nobody listened to your concerns. The only thing I can really suggest is to try and cultivate friends outside of school who have similar views. Hopefully things at school will die down after a few days.", "NTA but people on this sub will not understand that. The fact there were no Polynesian people involved with the theme planning says a lot", "NTA. The cross between cultural appreciation/sharing and cultural appropriation is tough. People have borrowed from each other\u2019s cultures for a very very long time, and it will continue to happen. I completely see your viewpoint in this, and what probably would\u2019ve been great is if the school had some sort of curriculum built in that educated people about Polynesian culture leading up to the dance. This is the perfect gray area where having a dance of that theme isn\u2019t great, but probably isn\u2019t going to do much harm in the long run. Ultimately, cultural appropriation is about power and oppression, and who gets harmed in the process. It\u2019s incredibly complicated. I don\u2019t think you did wrong, people should absolutely not have bullied you about it, and there was probably a better way the school could have kept the dance theme while also educating students about the history, and it is sad that everyone refused to engage with the conversation at all. Even that, I get - who knows what else teachers and administrators were overwhelmed with where they just did not what to address it (even if they should\u2019ve). You sound like you\u2019re trying to do the right thing, and keep learning and educating yourself and expanding your horizons. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA, I know I will get downvoted but Hawaiian culture gets vultured like no other & people keep going there when the residents specifically say not to. It\u2019s a state so people think it\u2019s not a culture & I commend you for standing up for the preservation of a culture that\u2019s not your own.", "NTA. I bet it wasn\u2019t even an actual luau, yeah? Any in-ground cooking? Any traditional foods or dances or music? \n\nNo, they probably had neon flowers and \u201cleis\u201d and some dudes wore skirts.\n\nThis is not the right venue for an understanding of appropriation, and unfortunately neither is your school. Good for you for being armed with citations and information, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting so much pushback due to your advocacy.", "This must be a regional thing here, because in my state having a luau (without actual polynesian performers or authentic involvement to render it appreciation) would definitely be just as cringe as having a pow wow theme with a bunch of white people wearing war paint and headdresses.. It would definitely be seen as appropriation and would not be done in the area i live in. But I'm getting the vibe from the comments that many communities still do party city style luaus and see you as the ah. Different communities have different standards on this type of stuff. Sounds like your standards aren't aligned with the place you live in. You are nta but you are going to keep having this problem if you try to change a community that has such a strong consensus of disagreement with you on this topic. Keep your head down until graduation and try to find a community that is a better fit for you afterward.", "YTA", "I think NTA but a bunch of your peers think you are and in high school their perception is your reality.  Keep your head up someone else will be the new outcast before you know it. I\u2019d love to hear the perspective of someone from a pacific island though.", "NTA \n\nBut maybe \u201cnah\u201d. Clearly a lot of commenters in this thread don\u2019t understand the difference between appropriation and appreciation.  This party was probably not intentionally malicious like say full blackface, but the commercialization of a culture that was forcibly annexed to the United States for the benefit of rich plantation owners is absolutely appropriation and not appreciation.   A \u201cluau\u201d prom is not teaching you anything authentic about Hawaiian culture nor teaching you to respect it.  It\u2019s just an exotic theme to your schoolmates.\n\nAlso it\u2019s hilarious to see people citing the \u201cauthority\u201d of having gone to a luau sponsored by a commercial tourist venture as a \u201chaole\u201d and claiming any special knowledge or understanding of this topic.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously it going to on its own have a big effect in the grand scheme of things whether or not you got this prom theme nixed.

I joined the student council and our first task was planning the homecoming dance. We suggested themes and voted on them, and a few weeks later it was announced that the 'beach' theme had won.\n\nOnly, that's not what they were calling it.\n\nNow, I would've been fine with a beach theme even though it's not what I voted for.  Honestly, it was a smart move choosing a beach theme since we already had the decorations.  What pissed me off was that they were calling it an 'Island Luau.'  None of the people on student council are Polynesian, myself included.  I alerted one of the teachers supervising that this might not be a good idea as it could be considered cultural appropriation, but I was ignored.  I spoke to my friends about how I didn't feel comfortable with them using Hawaiian culture as a theme, but no one started speaking about it.  I decided not to go to the dance and tried to get others not to by posting on Snapchat and Instagram about how harmful these casual instances of cultural appropriation can be and I cited an article on the subject ('More Than A Night of Harmless Fun: Hawaiian Cultural Appropriation' by Erica Lee and Melissa Gan on The Sheaf).  \n\nI was met with an overwhelming amount of hate and negativity, being told I was 'just doing it for attention' and I'm 'too sensitive.'\n\nFor clarification: I never wanted them to completely cancel the homecoming.  We deserve a dance.  All I wanted was for them to not call it a luau and not pass out any plastic leis.  I spoke the teachera and school counselor about this and all of them refused to change anything, saying it was too late to make any changes (there was still about a month until the dance).  Posters, tickets, and other promotional items had already been created and I wasn't asking them to take them down and make new ones.  It wouldn't have done anything; everyone already knew what the dance was originally called.  I literally only wanted them to make a short announcement on the school's Google Classroom saying, going forward, it would be referred to as 'beach night' or something.  They refused.\n\nAfter the posts on Snapchat and Instagram, I got multiple threats.  When I went to school on Monday (this had happened over the weekend), I found out about 17 kids said they were going to 'jump' me.  I lost a ton of 'friends' over this and I now cannot walk through the halls of my school without kids yelling stuff at me.  I can't eat lunch without kids coming up to me thinking they're being funny by asking me what my thoughts on cultural appropriation are.\n\nI genuinely do not believe I was in the wrong but I know that I cannot accurately judge myself, so I came here.  AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just want to try to balance out the y t a comments. I will add one thing for the people saying that as a non-Polynesian you don\u2019t have the right to speak up. I would argue that if you are part of the group in power, you have a responsibility to speak up. If marginalized groups aren\u2019t in the space and nobody speaks up, then there\u2019s no opportunity for others to learn.

I\u2019m sorry the adults involved weren\u2019t more supportive of your efforts.", "NTA \n\nBut as you can see from the comments to your post there is still a long way to go with understanding racism, bias, and how offensive it can be to other cultures to treat their culture as a party them. \n\nEven as an adult it can be hard to speak up knowing the type of response you\u2019ll get. \u201cWhite Fragility\u201d is a great book that looks at why white people have so much trouble talking about and understanding racism.

Also the one below your comment. Partaking in a culture, being invited to it, is not the same as appropriation - that is true.\n\nIn the case of this dance they technically were not appreciating any Hawaiian culture - just spinning off a generalisation that Hawaii = beach party. Their interest was a beach party - they brand it a Luau (nothing more, no engagement with the actual culture or effort in that way). Had someone said I love Hawaiian luau (maybe they\u2019d been there or a relative) and tried to learn and recreate one - I\u2019d get that.

From what we found out back then, it\u2019s key to consider if you\u2019re engaging with that culture and then sharing your appreciation - or absorbing (stereotyped) parts for your agenda, to do your own thing without care to know the actual cultural heritage.\n\nI\u2019m from an ethnic culture and love hosting people, and we are proud of our culture and share it, btw that\u2019s a trait of many cultures (hospitality). I get what you mean, I do not feel anyone is appropriating because they enjoyed themselves or later went to restaurants that serve our cuisine with people of other cultures etc. Some fall in love with the clothes and so on. It\u2019s nice. Please don\u2019t compare this or conflate it to excuse appropriation.\n\nFolks who take cultural items and plaster them to sell their idea or product, or dance, and not interested in the culture at all. That\u2019s appropriation. If you like a cultural item, buy the real deal (not the H&M knock off for example lol). Naming this dance a luau was for the theme (deco and accents for the beach party) - not to appreciate Hawaii. Don\u2019t apply retrograde meaning to make this better.\n\nOP, you need to learn when people are not listening - explaining isn\u2019t going to change anything but how much frustration they feel.

I can see hula dancing getting a side eye.\n\nBut beach, luau, and lei?  The latter being something they literally pass out at the airport?  What culture is that appropriating?  I went to a similar party in central Berlin.  It\u2019s a cheap fun theme and it\u2019s inexpensive decorations for a school theme.\n\nThough I\u2019d go with ESH since being a killjoy white savior does *not* excuse threats of violence and bullying.", "No, it is NOT full of \"racist assholes\". It is full of people who wanted to eat some kailua pork at a luau and have a pleasant diversion for an evening. No, it's not 100% authentic. Big whoop.

Lol", "How we be sure the others weren\u2019t afraid to speak up after seeing how OP was treated?", "I dont think this thread cares about that. Hawaii and its continued colonization issues arent what people tend to know/care about. They just know Hawaii is a pretty vacation spot and theres food parties and that they should be able to celebrate and appreciate that part of the \"culture\". There is no ~meaning to Hawaiian culture so there is no issue.", "That's cool. The clothes are so beautiful.", "I just replied above this. Just fyi, you took an interest in the Indian people you work for.\n\nThis post has nothing to do with interest in Hawaiian culture. That would be retrograde meaning where before there wasn\u2019t.

Most poi served at commercial luaus is many days old and has begun the fermentation process.
