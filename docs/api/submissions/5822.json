Some background: I'm pretty sure I'm autistic and sometime have difficulty expressing myself well, and I get flustered easily when I feel like I'm not being understood. \n\nA few days, I saw a video on tiktok that really resonated with me. It was of a woman asking her partner to wash a mug for her and explaining how acts of service are her love language and the washing of the mug would make her feel loved. I really related to this because I have a special mug that I like to use in the mornings, but I have executive dysfunction and don't wash it as often as I should because it's handwash-only. I realized that I would find it really meaningful if my gf did that for me. \n\nYesterday, I finally worked up the courage to ask her. For some context, we'd already finished dinner and were relaxing in front of the TV. Since everything was calm it seemed like a good time to ask. Unfortunately, my gf seemed pretty annoyed. To her point, she is in charge of grocery shopping and cooking and makes us some great food. Dishes are usually my responsibility, but that is usually just stuff that can go in the dishwasher. The few pans and knives that my gf is fussy about hand washing are handled by her because there is absolutely nothing I hate more than hand washing dishes. I tried to explain to her that she could wash the mug when she washes her cookware without much extra effort, but she said that since I'm the only one who uses the mug and since I let it get a little crusty and gross sometimes it should be my responsibility. Also I could have asked her earlier while dishes were being done instead of asking her to stop watching the movie, get up from the couch, and go back to doing dishes.\n\nAt that point I was feeling really flustered and embarrassed and couldn't cope with the situation, so I decided it would be best to step away. I ended up sleeping in the guest room and she's been really distant today and even went out to dinner with some friends without inviting me. I understand that I was asking her to do a chore, but I would have really appreciated her giving me a chance to at least explain my thinking.", "created_utc": 1672205355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx1e5r/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_wash_my_mug_and_getting/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It means recognizing where you\u2019re falling short and doing your best (sometimes with professional advice) to create systems that help you live up to your responsibilities. For instance, you can link tasks or activities. Finishing your coffee leads directly to washing your mug. Every single time. Or find a new, DW safe mug you like. Maybe, maybe, maybe, if you get your mug sparkling brand new clean and make an absolute daily habit of putting it in the sink and filling it with hot soapy water right after you finish your coffee or whatever, maybe, if she\u2019s feeling really generous, your gf could be persuaded to add washing your mug to her other hand washing.", "YTA. If you let a mug get into a state where it will be laborious to wash, you are actually out of your mind if you think it\u2019s in any way ok to offload that onto someone and frame it as a love language. \n\nEspecially with your timing.

If you don\u2019t like hand washing, get a mug that doesn\u2019t require hand washing OR hire someone to do the dishes for you. Expecting your GF to wash your stuff for you because you don\u2019t like to do it yourself is not acceptable. You\u2019re a grown up, you need to be able to take care of yourself.

She DOES do acts of service for you (she shops, she cooks, she deals with whatever the hell you're going off about here). Executive dysfunction seems like something you need to tackle day by day and work towards improving or creating tools that help. That don't include asking your gf to do a chore for you.", "YTA. Your gf was watching a movie. Why should she pause it to wash your crusty ass mug? \n\nThat's great if you discovered your love language, but there's a time and a place to discuss it with her. During a movie, after all dishes were already done, is not the time.", "I'm Autistic, too, and washing dishes is a big hard thing for me due to executive dysfunction and sensory issues, as well, so I get it. I would absolutely see it as a really meaningful act of love for someone to do it for me, so I understand that, too.\n\nBut YTA. \n\n1. You demanding it automatically nullifies it as an act of love. It has to be something they do just because they know you would appreciate it, not because you demanded it. \n\n2. You are adding to her mental/househols labour. If you have issues with executive dysfunction, I guarantee she's already doing more than the lion's share of the mental/household load--more than you probably realise, because she sees and does things that wouldn't even cross your mind. So asking to do this is adding one more thing to her load. \n\n3. You asked her AFTER she'd already sat down to relax and watch a movie. You could have asked her while she was already doing dishes, \"hey sweetie, would you be able to give my mug a quick wash while you're doing those other things, I'd be really appreciative?\" To ask when she's already done and in relax mode is bound to make anyone annoyed. As an Autistic person you should know this better than anyone. Think about how you feel when you are made to switch brain modes because someone asked you to do something while you are trying to relax or regulate.\n\n4. Instead of focusing on how she shows you love, you could have taken it as an opportunity to reflect on what her love language is and what you could do for her to show your love. That would have been a better takeaway from the video.", "YTA, it\u2019s your crusty mug, you wash it. You know what\u2019s probably a love language for you girlfriend? Being treated with respect and not some kind of chore-o-matic.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nYou tried to communicate a point and did a great job. But your expectation is BS and frankly, you should stop letting TikTok videos plant the seeds that destroy your relationship. No video on earth should make you reach the conclusion that someone needs to communicate how they love you in ways that you decide.\n\nYour partner gets to decide how she loves you and how she communicates that love.", "YTA it seems like you're using this video as an excuse to not do something that, realistically, you should be doing. Even from your post, it seems like your gf does most of the housework, so why add another thing? Really?? She isn't a slave. Use a different mug instead of expecting her to was a mug you can't be bothered to.", "YTA saying acts of service is your love language and acknowledging the acts she does would have been the way to go. \n\nInstead you basically said you don't do enough, do this too.\n\nYta", "YTA.

Don\u2019t think you meant to be, but you accidentally are. What I\u2019m hearing is that your girlfriend does a large chunk of the domestic labor in the kitchen already, and you put away some dishes in the dishwasher. She handwashes the pans and knives not because she\u2019s fussy because most pans and knives get ruined in the dishwasher, so they\u2019re hand wash only. She\u2019s already acts of servicing the hell out you by doing a lot. Even if you hate hand washing dishes, a single mug (that only you use) takes less than a minute to wash and cannot be so horrible that you can\u2019t do it yourself, especially if you\u2019re having it get crusty and gross. I sympathize with the fact that it might be a sensory issue but it also probably seems degrading to her to be asked to do this when she already does so much, even if it wouldn\u2019t be a nuisance.", "YTA\n\nCmon dude.", "Is this a copypasta? How many times will we see the exact same story?\n\nYTA either way. You got butthurt bc she won\u2019t wash your mug? Boohoo.

Pretty rude in my opinion. \n\nI\u2019ve seen the tik tok you\u2019re talking about but you shouldn\u2019t have brought it up during her relaxing down time because it is essentially a chore that you\u2019re asking her to do regardless of your intent.\n\nAlso, it sounds like she does a lot around the house and loading the dishwasher + laundry isn\u2019t a great long term split of household chores if she\u2019s doing the majority of other things. \n\nMaybe think about her love language and how you can do things for her.", "YTA. Why don\u2019t you consider everything she already does as a way of showing her love for you, instead of wanting her to wash your crusty mug?", "YTA for sure. If acts of service is your love language, that means you should appreciate any sort of extra help she offers you. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean you get to make her do one specific gross chore that you hate and if she doesn\u2019t do it, then it means that she doesn\u2019t love you. \n\nYou felt embarrassed because you should feel embarrassed, tbh. It seems like you just jumped on an excuse to make your gf do a chore that you hate doing and pretended like it has anything to do with love languages. Manipulative.", "Yikes. YTA\n\nI interpreted this as you basically told your partner to inconvenience themselves for no particular reason other than to prove their love to you. It sounds like you're dealing with some stuff but that was pretty rude, not to mention very awkward to be sitting watching a movie with your partner and just out of nowhere you thought \"I think now is a good time to ask them to do something for me that I am perfectly capable of doing myself\". I can't pretend to understand the dynamic between you and your GF but you yourself implied you're the dishes person.\n\nI would strongly recommend not using TikTok as a gauge against your own relationship.", "Info: what is her love language and what do you do yourself to make her feel loved?\n\nI mean, it sounds like she does a lot of service for you already, but do you make her feel appreciated?", "YTA. I don\u2019t believe your love language is acts of service because you don\u2019t mention doing any. It seems you\u2019re weaponizing love languages, undiagnosed autism, and whatever else you can find on tik tok to trick your girlfriend into being your maid.\n\nThe funny thing about relationships is that people can leave you for being an asshole no matter what bs excuse you have to defend being an asshole.", "INFO so what *do* you contribute to the household?", "YTA -- having undiagnosed autism doesn't mean you have a right to dump a chore on your gf at any random time of the day.\n\nif acts of service are your love language, great ! but washing a crusty mug is not how she'd like to show love ... and if she is doing all the other household chores, it seems like you need a more even split.", "I'm autistic and have executive functioning issues, and I get around it by setting alerts on my phone for things that I know I have to get done. Do that instead of using autism as an excuse to dump more on your girlfriend than she already does.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, she does so much for you already, and asking about it in the middle of a movie is the worst time to ask her to do even more. Mental disorders don\u2019t mean your partner has to take on everything you hate while you do nothing. There has to be a balance there, my partner has OCD and HATES the feeling of wet food and doing the dishes. I have ADHD and often leave the dishes to become science excitements, but am good about cooking and doing the shopping for the house, plus cleaning the house. The comprise is my roommate puts dishes in the dish washer and my partner does the hand washing with gloves and a scrub that has a handle. Yeah it sucks for her but it is unfair to me and stresses me out a bunch to do all of the dishes. \n\nThe moral of the story is that you have to find a way to cope with this. If your favorite mug needs to be hand washed you need to find a way to do it, if that\u2019s setting a timer to dump it every out day and clean it or hiring someone to help you with the dishes that\u2019s your responsibility. Your partner cannot do everything you hate because then they aren\u2019t your partner they\u2019re a live in nanny.

For being a massive ass to your girlfriend and basically doing the bare minimum, and especially for blaming undiagnosed autism for being an ass.

You compare loading and emptying a dishwasher to grocery shopping and cooking. Those last two tasks take a lot of time and planning. That\u2019s not even close to the small task of dishes, especially when you have a dishwasher. So she\u2019s already performing huge \u201cacts of service\u201d to you. And then you try to add to it. And when she said \u201cno\u201d you don\u2019t apologize and explain but act in a way that could be interpreted as angry or insulted by shutting down all communication and sleeping in the guest room. \n\nTo top it all you are complaining here that she didn\u2019t give you a chance to explain.", "YTA this story is so dumb it must be true", "Acts of Service is my love language as well.

My love language does not mean I get to dump my responsibilities to him. It means my husband knows that acts of service resonate with me more than something like gift giving. He chooses how he wants to show that.

Some background: I'm pretty sure I'm autistic and sometime have difficulty expressing myself well, and I get flustered easily when I feel like I'm not being understood. \n\nA few days, I saw a video on tiktok that really resonated with me. It was of a woman asking her partner to wash a mug for her and explaining how acts of service are her love language and the washing of the mug would make her feel loved. I really related to this because I have a special mug that I like to use in the mornings, but I have executive dysfunction and don't wash it as often as I should because it's handwash-only. I realized that I would find it really meaningful if my gf did that for me. \n\nYesterday, I finally worked up the courage to ask her. For some context, we'd already finished dinner and were relaxing in front of the TV. Since everything was calm it seemed like a good time to ask. Unfortunately, my gf seemed pretty annoyed. To her point, she is in charge of grocery shopping and cooking and makes us some great food. Dishes are usually my responsibility, but that is usually just stuff that can go in the dishwasher. The few pans and knives that my gf is fussy about hand washing are handled by her because there is absolutely nothing I hate more than hand washing dishes. I tried to explain to her that she could wash the mug when she washes her cookware without much extra effort, but she said that since I'm the only one who uses the mug and since I let it get a little crusty and gross sometimes it should be my responsibility. Also I could have asked her earlier while dishes were being done instead of asking her to stop watching the movie, get up from the couch, and go back to doing dishes.\n\nAt that point I was feeling really flustered and embarrassed and couldn't cope with the situation, so I decided it would be best to step away. I ended up sleeping in the guest room and she's been really distant today and even went out to dinner with some friends without inviting me. I understand that I was asking her to do a chore, but I would have really appreciated her giving me a chance to at least explain my thinking.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Telling someone to just get a planner and do it, is basically the same as saying \u2018ah just shake it off and try and walk\u2019 to someone that has a broken leg.", "I agree a dishwasher safe mug would be *a* solution to their issue. But I really don\u2019t think the mug is an actual issue versus their clash in not seeing what their GF is already doing too much of in terms of Acts of Service anyway. And it doesn\u2019t even seem like GF is upset; she just put a boundary and said no, but OP is sulking because they took it as a large rejection blow.", "I personally appreciate it.  I am ADHD and struggle a lot with journals and crap like that and the advice to use them is suler unhelpful. Ive tried, and it just doesnt work for me. Between the executive dysfunction and my crappy memory, i either forget they exist or cant make myself fill them out.", "Oh yeah I can see how that sucks. I think OP needs to seek professional help if they really have this."]}
