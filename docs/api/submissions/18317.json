And, let's face it, no matter what they actually said, they were telling you they were stopping by. You were in no way being rude to your mother. You were simply setting a reasonable boundary. \n\nThey are all angry at you because, not only did you establish your own boundaries and authority (in your own home), but you successfully pushed back against a power play they made, them trying to establish a precedent where they can stop by whenever they want.\n\nUnderstand that your mother will always know how to push your buttons because she installed them.", "NTA just shining up your backbone & it sounds like you're gonna need it.", "NTA, at all.

If anything, it\u2019s incredibly rude to invite not only yourself but someone else to another person\u2019s house last minute. Clearly you don\u2019t like the stepdad\u2019s sister either. You\u2019re an adult and well within your right to decline having visitors in your house! And the way you said it was perfectly reasonable and not rude", "NTA - They were rude to just show up.   This isn't 1890 when no one had a phone.    No excuse for behavior like this.", "NTA! My wife's parents are just as pushy. Back you into a corner to where it is hard to say no and then act appalled when you stick to your guns. Keep wup the good work with the bounderies and the renovations, I'm sure they'll look great \ud83d\udc4d", "LOL - even in 1890, they'd have had to give the maid their calling card and sit in the carriage while the maid went to inquire if Sir/Madam was \"at home\" (i.e., receiving visitors) - and if not, they weren't admitted.", "NTA\n\nBut now they'll just turn up without announcing with a phone call beforehand. If they do turn up and refuse to leave then set them to work helping you clean.  They are not guests.\n\nDoes your mother know that you don't want her SIL to know where you live?", "NTA!! I prefer to be called or texted asking me if someone wants to stop at my house to visit. \nI don't like people to just come over. I might nor feel like having company. I tell people this too, in a nice way, so that they without a doubt know........some assholes still do not listen. I fucking hate it.", "NTA - I\u2019d be the same.         \nTho you do realise she now knows where you live, even if they didn\u2019t come in the house ?", "And there was a societal time period that was \u201cproper\u201d for caller\n For example, it was only \u201cproper\u201d to call in most of Victorian society between 3 and 6 pm.", "NTA\n\nSometimes the best way to keep out uninvited guests is to just not answer the door.  At least they called before pulling into the drive.\n\nYou don\u2019t need the pressure.", "NTA I hate uninvited guests", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s rude to drop in uninvited.  Even ruder to come when you\u2019ve been told not to.  There\u2019s a reason certain family does not even know what town I live in (my socials list a diff town), and I live in a gated community.", "NTA... dont answer the door!", "I would work F Y into the conversation.", "NTA, if I didn\u2019t invite you, don\u2019t come over. It\u2019s as simple as that. This is a well established rule in my house.\u2019", "NTA. Did your mum know you didn't want this woman to know where you live?", "NTA.  Especially if your mother is aware you do not want the stepdad's sister to even know where you live.", "Yes we definitely do not like her. She is very judgmental and has to give unsolicited life advice to everyone she meets and it\u2019s really just exhausting to say the least.", "Yeah I do. Well my \u201caunt\u201d (stepfather\u2019s sister) actually didn\u2019t know where we physically lived until today when my mom decided to bring her through our neighborhood and point out our house. Watched them ride by seconds after hanging up the phone.", "Does your mom know you don't like this woman, because if she does and she still tried to bring her to your home, then that's an AH move. If she doesn't know, then tell her so that she respects your boundaries going forward.", "NTA. Even if your kitchen was finished you are not obligated to have people in your house when you don\u2019t feel like having them.", "Unlikely. Haven\u2019t made that clear until today.", "I don\u2019t think she does. I\u2019ve never made it clear to her. But she is definitely aware we like our privacy. We have made it known to her when we moved back here to our town (where most of our families live) that if we wanted certain family members to have our address we would give it to them.", "Makes sense then. I think you should have a proper talk with her (again, I suppose) to get her to understand your boundaries. I'm the same as you, I value my privacy and detest unwelcome company and I've let my family know this. They've respected my boundaries so far without incident.", "Nta please have a talk with your mother to wait for an invitation or do not visit as of now.", "NTA. \n\nAnyone who gets upset when you enforce reasonable boundaries, was taking advantage of your lack of them. You mother apparently thinks she has a free pass to trample said boundaries, because she\u2019s family. She does not. You are an adult, it is your home, and she needs to treat *you* with some respect. \n\nShe asked. You said no. That should have been the end of it. Frankly, after being (I assume) verbally harassed, hanging up was probably the politest, most restrained thing you could do. \n\nHOWEVER. Get a doorbell camera, do not give your mother a key or tell her where the spare is, and make sure your home is secure. I guarantee your mother has already told you stepfathers sister (who I assume is who you didn\u2019t want in your home) where you live. Be safe and continue to protect your peace.", "Seriously, family is not a card to act entitled. NTA"]}
