You\u2019re protecting an abuse victim from their abusers. The same reasoning the parents used to kick Joe out (he\u2019s an adult) means they\u2019re not entitled to any information about him. You asking him what he wants and respecting his wishes was exactly the right move.", "NTA\nHeat of the moment? They threatened to kick him out when they were legally able to, then they followed through. And at the first possible second! That\u2019s not a \u201cheat of the moment\u201d decision. They probably want Joe to move back in so they can brainwash him into thinking he\u2019s not gay. I don\u2019t usually condone lying, but in this case it\u2019s justified since all you did was respect your nephews wishes. It\u2019s wonderful that Joe has you to rely on when his own parents failed him.", "As someone who was kicked out at 16 for being gay and later found out my dad would have murdered me had I stayed -- I wished I had an Aunt like you then. Fuck them, and good on you for helping him. Parents like this burn me up inside. You're NTA. -- PLEASE ensure his parents are banned from your house while he is with you. He will thank you deeply for this.", "NTA, you are awesome for being there for your nephew, you did nothing wrong, and your sister and his dad can kick rocks", "NTA. If he doesn't have them already, you guys need to retrieve all his important documents. Birth certificate, SSN card, etc... It will be up to him if he wants to have a relationship with his parents again. It's so good he has an adult he can trust and that can support him during this time.", "You cannot threaten a few years in advance and then wait specifically for midnight and then claim it was the heat of the moment.  NTA and keep supporting your nephew\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA they clearly planned this! They kicked out their son at MIDNIGHT the second he turned 18.\n\nBet someone called them out on how evil this was to do and that's why they're backpeddling", "NTA\n\nFirst, good for you being there for your nephew.  If you asked him, and he didn't want them to know where he was, then you made the right decision in not telling them.  Personally I would just have ignored the text and not respond at all, but that was your call to make.\n\nSince they kicked him out the very minute he turned 18......that was not a \"heat of the moment decision\", they planned it.  It's now his decision if he wants contact with them, so nothing more for you to do than just be there for him.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. You honoured your nephew\u2019s wishes. That is the only thing that is important. How your family can\u2019t understand Joe\u2019s needs/wants trump Vicki\u2019s is incomprehensible.", "NTA. They kicked him out at midnight on his 18th birthday, fuck em.", "NTA and thank you so much for taking him in. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have lied and instead not responded, but really who cares after what they did. Also major BS on heat of the moment. It was premeditated", "\u2026.. in a fair fucking world, a lightning bolt would hit your sister\u2019s home. Nope, you are certainly NTA, but all the family members that side with homophobia are\u2026.", "Also 2 days later.... it took them 2 days to realize a \"heat of the moment\" decision. BS! Someone asked about their son or called them out and they are trying to save face. NTA protect the nephew.", "I'm with you on this one.  OP is NOT the AH.  They planned it and executed it, so now they have to live with it.  If Joe wants them to know where he is he can tell them.  He went to OP because he trusts them.  Keep that trust, Joe.  At least one family member has your back.", ">\"Heat of the moment\" my flat ass.\n\nThis, exactly this. NTA OP. They didn't randomly get upset all over again. They've known for a couple of years that they were going to do this. They just realize now that they look like horrible parents (because they *are*).", "exactly, they planned it for a while and literally threw their child out in the rain.  You took him in and gave him shelter and when they probably realized how bad this would make them look, they tried to back peddle.  Even then you didn't take it on yourself. you asked him what he wanted and you backed him to the hilt. it was his choice NTA", "\u201cFlat ass\u201d lol", "Right? I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d bother lying after all that time.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m wondering if (with many homophobes believing being gay is a choice) that they expected him to just agree to stop being gay when he saw they were really kicking him out. Now that\u2019s he didn\u2019t, is gone and they\u2019re blocked, they are shocked and want to act like it was nothing or discipline or some bullshit.\n\nDefinitely NTA he needs somewhere safe and they clearly aren\u2019t that. He\u2019s 18, he gets to decide what they have access to with him now.", "They probably figured out they couldn\u2019t claim him on taxes next year unless he lived there for a few more months.", "Exactly. They spent years waiting for that moment. I don't even believe for a moment that they regret it. No, they care about how others perceive them for kicking out their gay son in 2023.", "I\u2019m imagining the clock striking midnight and the parents going\u201dOH SHIT HE\u2019S STILL GAY\u201d acting all surprised", "Right? They found out he was gay a few years ago! That\u2019s not heat of the moment. At all. That is a vicious, vindictive plan. Horrible people. I\u2019m glad OP is in Joe\u2019s corner.", "This. Don't deny, don't apologize. Clarify that Joe didn't want contact with people who would throw him out in the middle of the night. You might want to add that their actions were not just assholery and unsafe but we're also an illegal eviction.\n\nNTA\n\nKeep him safe where he is for as long as he needs. And consider yourself as far from being an asshole as possible.", "Agreed. It's his choice now, and if he doesn't want his parents in his life anymore, that's on him and I don't blame him. His parents are not entitled to him. NTA", "If he was a minor, then the next step would be calling cps and law enforcement on the parents.", "NTA. They both just dont want to look bad to the public eye for kicking out their son for being gay. If im petty, put them on eblast and say they are homophobes. At least youre someone that your nephew can rely on", "Or so they can threaten to do so again if he doesn\u2019t toe their line", "And at midnight. Those are some hateful people looking for their victim to keep harassing. Wow. Please show him real love.", "He actually didn\u2019t come out, they confiscated his phone and read his texts for an unrelated reason and found out from a conversation with his friend.", "In all honesty, it is NOT OP's responsibility to ease the anger and stress of 2 parents who kicked there son out because he is gay. \n\nIn fact, having OP meet face to face with the parents makes the situation worse by making her a go-between, something OP should absolutely avoid at all costs.", "They've had 18 years to learn to be decent people and to love their kid. They had their chance and they blew it. Fuck wasting a single breath on explaining anything to those bigoted shitgibbons.", "So OP is the asshole because if something that didn't happen had happened then other things that also didn't happen might've happened?\n\nNot to mention if the police even accepted this as a missing person's case (\"Ok so you kicked your adult son out and now he isn't here?\") the first thing they'd do is contact family members or other places he might go. I doubt OP would lie to a cop doing a wellness check.\n\nThe resources expended would be next to nothing.\n\nAnd would be the responsibility of the bigoted parents who kicked their son out, not his uncle who protected him from them.", "Bullshit. They made a choice to throw him out in the middle of the night with nothing but the clothes on their back. Maybe she could have said \u201cI know where he is but he doesn\u2019t want you to know\u201d but that doesn\u2019t outweigh the choice they made that led to the whole situation.", "A heat of the moment decision they've been talking about for years, at that.", "I'm sure they had this vision in mind that they'd kick him out, he'd spent a few nights roughing it on the streets, and that he'd come crawling back begging their forgiveness for his \"choice\" to be gay.\n\nWhen they hadn't gotten the satisfaction of him demeaning himself after 48 hours, they started to realize it wasn't going to their plan.", ">that they expected him to just agree to stop being gay\n\nSounds right on the money to me.  \"Scare him straight\" becomes \"Oh no, we've lost our son.\"\n\nAll they've likely come to accept is that this particular \"campaign\" didn't work.  They're not safe people for him to be around.", "I don't blame him at all. His parents most likely kicked him out the instant they were first legally able to because they wanted him to \"suffer the consequences of his decisions\" (since they likely believe he \"chose\" to be gay). When that failed and he didn't come crawling back promising to be their good little heterosexual son, they want him back? I'd wonder what other form of manipulation or punishment they have planned. Like trying to commit him or attempt to send him to one of those right wing/anti-gay \"camps\". \n\nJoe is better off not going anywhere near them until he's comfortably set up an adult life for himself.", "Agreed.", "That's even worse, ugh. \n\nI'm so glad he has you.", "[deleted]", "That's why I put it in quotes. Thwy got called out by someone who probably knew the plan.", "Horrible people. I\u2019m glad OP is in Joe\u2019s corner.", "It is up to JOE to decide if it is to late or not. My heart breaks for him. Kicked out at midnight, in the rain, with only a backpack. That is not something he will get over quickly. There are some actions people take that have lifetime consequences. This could definitely be one of them. Let's remember, Joe had already lived for 2 years with his parents' homophobia BEFORE they discarded him on his birthday. It would be completely understandable if Joe cuts his parents out of his life forever. Again, how he proceeds is completely up to him.", "They planned kicking their child out. Planned it for YEARS.  It was not a heat of the moment decision. \n\nThe priority here is the young man\u2019s physical and emotional safety, not the needs of the parents.", "Sounds like you\u2019re projecting your own family issues onto a very different situation. There\u2019s no reasoning with homophobes. These people are cruel, quite literally kicking him out the moment he turned 18, and sending him out into the pouring rain. They had no idea if he had a safe place to go, or a safe way to get there. They planned this for years. If Joe decides later in life that he wants to forgive these people that may well be healing for him on some level, HOWEVER OP has no business trying to facilitate that any sooner than Joe wants it (which he likely never will). OP is doing the exact right thing just by being a safe space for this young man.", "Yeah you are right, hope this things goes well for Joe and such thing never happens to him."]}
