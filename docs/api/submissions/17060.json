So, I moved into a one bedroom with nine other people and started to sell plasma like everyone else. We barely ate, drank and did whatever drugs we could. Most of us only showered every other week. A day after we lost that apartment, I ran into my brother and he cried as he begged me to come home because I looked like a zombie. Then he demanded that I be let home.\n\nBefore I was kicked out, I worked every day with my father.  Usually, qe left the house at 6 am and we got home around 8 pm. He was paying me a whopping 30 bucks a day. The excuse being that he paid for everything at home and that he was teaching me a trade. Do, I was working more than full time with most of the money I should have been paid going to the household... and I got kicked out because my mother didn't like the way I cut my hair.\n\n\n\nSo after all of that, I have a soft heart for kids in Joe's place.\n\n\n\n\nBright side for me is that I started dating my future wife and moved out with her 4 months after I moved home. We've been married for 29 years coming up in June. I did learn the trade, and paid my assistants well in reaction to how I was treated. I was super good at it, but I hated every minute on the job. Also, my wife was one of those people that expects their children to move out within a couple years of graduating, but I think I've changed her mind. So, my son doesn't ever have to worry about needing a place to live. I'm not talking about permanent residency. Like this winter he came on hard times and I suggested that he move home.

Please love  and take care of your nephew he needs you now more than ever and please adhere to his wishes. Let him decide who he wants contact with\u2026 Your sister by not stopping her husband condoned his actions against her son so they made their bed now they must lie in it. Thanks for being a hero!!Awesome and good job!!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Right? That 2 seconds after midnight move took some pre-planning. Waking the kid up out of a sound sleep ON HIS BIRTHDAY and then kicking him out in the rain is intentionally cruel. And your sister went along with it. \n\nHere's what I'd say to her... \"You didn't deserve to know where Joe was. I hope that two days of not knowing hurt you half as much as you hurt him. You broke his heart. He wants nothing to do with you, and neither do I. You and Tom and your hateful souls can go straight to hell.\" \n\nAlso, I'd tell anyone in the family who thinks it was fine to kick the kid out to kiss my ass. Anyone who's not on Team Joe can pound sand. \n\nObviously NTA", "Right. On behalf of the alphabet mafia, I salute you. \n\nPlus if Joe is kicked out now since he is an adult, he is also old enough to decide whether he wants his parents to know where he is or not.", "Doesn't the term fail sort of imply they tried?", "I believe that they had threatened to kick him out several times. They also threatened to send him to various \u201cchristian therapy groups\u201d but never did because they didn\u2019t have the money. His parents had been nicer to him lately, so he thought they had changed their minds. This is all according to him by the way, I think he\u2019s been desperate for someone to talk to about his parents.", "Yeah I was thinking the same thing. My mom kicked me out of the house as a \u201cheat of the moment\u201d situation, I left to sleep over at a friends house because fuck waiting outside for an indefinite amount of time(waited about 10-15 minutes). The next day she had called the cops because she was worried I got kidnapped. To be fair, I was like 10 at the time so there is probably more reason to think I got kidnapped. Also, the punishment didn\u2019t seem to fit the crime (got kicked out for coming home late(~10pm)). Also, she\u2019s never kicked me out of the house as a punishment since then.", "Be the Aunt he needs. (assuming aunt, apologies if wrong) His parents plotted to evict him with a humiliating and dangerous stunt, minutes after turning 18.  He is so on his own, and even though he may not want anything to do with them, he will still grieve that loss.  Be there for him and let the adults blather and lie all they want.  Joe is obviously not safe with his parents. be there for him. You are a hell of an awesome relative.", "They probably waited for a rainstorm for maximum effect.  Assholes.\n\nNTA, OP", "more like the panic of a mom knowing that she looks like an absolute p.o.s. to anyone with even half a shred of decency", "I'm not a phone expert but I think they probably tracked his phone in order to find out where he was. I know they know he's at your place now but he may want to look into getting a new phone for the future, and for when he goes out, etc.", "so wait, have you just been finding out about this now once your nephew showed up? or had the general family been aware of how they've been treating your nephew all this time?", "And that he had a backpack of stuff prepared to take with himself", "Anytime I've said or done something in \"the heat of the moment\" I've said sorry within seconds because once it's out of ur mouth and u hear it u realize just how fucked ur being", "100% this. They yried to scare him straight and it screwed them in the ass.\n\nPun intended.", "Me too. I rarely read AITA post that make me really sad. Mad yes but never this sad that I'm near tears. I'm thinking of the movie \"Prayers for Bobby\" and what he had to live with in his parents home and what it led him to. My heart goes out to Joe and hope he can find happiness despite the hatefulness he's been living with for the last few years. I'm so happy he has his Aunt.", "We all had our suspicions, and we know what they think of gay people, but I\u2019m just now finding  out the specifics from my nephew. They all do know about my sister and BIL\u2019s vow to kick him out though, as my nephew reached out to my other sister when it first happened. My other sister, who can\u2019t keep her mouth closed to save her life, immediately spread the gossip around the whole family.", "> Hiding that the kid has been taken in leaves them wondering if he is dead or kidnapped etc. \n\nWell well well, if it isn\u2019t the consequences of those shitty parents\u2019 actions", ">is ridiculous and fairly abusive \n\nSo protecting him by lying is fine. \n\n>but obviously they don't want the kid to die.\n\nThen don't kick him out in the middle of the night to the streets? He could've died/get kidnapped after walking two blocks. This is the thinnest straw I've seen today. \n\n>Any family member lying to another about the safet yof their child is someone who is evil\n\nYou know what evil? Kicking your son into the street in the middle of the night, just because his gay. You thinking that one single lie is more evil than tossing your kid away from his home with nothing but a backpack is ridiculous.", "No, you\u2019re right. No threat at all! Who\u2019s ever heard of a Christian fundamentalist being violent toward a gay person?", "They already thrown him into the streets, all the options are on the table from there on.", "His literal safety was at risk. They were in an urgent situation to ensure his safety, not dealing with a minor fight in a family. He was at legitimate risk of harm.", "Agreed. Our comments go hand in hand, because they probably feel guilt for both looking like shitty parents to an outward community while also mourning the son they wish they\u2019d had despite said son still being alive. I have a feeling that their son could move back in as his authentic self and within six months, he\u2019d be confronted and/or kicked out again for that \u201cgay shit\u201d. I honestly hope he never looks back.", "Two things I hate:\n\n1. People who kick their kids out on their 18th birthday.\n2. People who kick their kids out for being gay.\n\nYay! These parents just won the quinella of my hate.\n\nNTA, OP. You're the angel.", "I listened to a speaker who was arguing that just as we have public defenders in Maryland to help the indigent in criminal cases, we should lawyers for civil cases, like evictions.   She said the the tenant wins 80% of the time if they have a lawyer.\n\nMade a lot of sense to me.  There's no point in having protective laws if the intended beneficiaries can't enforce their rights.", "I don't think anyone is looking for or expecting contrition.", "so then if they all know that your sister and BIL have been verbalizing this kind of threat, and they know how your sister and BIL are... how in the name of john jacob jingleheimer schmidt is your family against you taking in your nephew??", ">You thinking that one single lie is more evil than tossing your kid away from his home with nothing but a backpack is ridiculous.\n\nI don't think that, and I've not said that anywhere at all.  The fact that you don't seem to get that doing nasty shit in response to someone being nasty isn't healthy is the issue.\n\nAnd I'm not sure how to compare making someone leave home at midnight and letting someone think their son could be dead.  Both seem pretty nasty and unnecessary.", "That part", "You Texans need to clean House and Senate.", "You're preaching to the choir!", "children aren't considered tenants so I'm not sure how you think the whole landlord thing would apply.", "And just because the judge awards that doesn't mean the landlord will ever see it. Most likely the landlord is out that money forever.  \n\n*source: happened to me"]}
