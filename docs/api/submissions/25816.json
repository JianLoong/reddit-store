You likely chose to start a family with him because you believe he\u2019ll be a great dad, so it\u2019s borderline offensive that he doesn\u2019t seem to try. But if you live in one of the many societies which teach gender roles, he has been indoctrinated with the idea that he can\u2019t do it.

I am pooing. I could stop halfway if time is urgent but I'll need to poo again like within 30 min so if I have the time, I prefer to just get it all out. I've been to a doctor, they suggested IBS but weren't really sure and didn't seem to think it was worth investigating further. They told me to get some kind of enzyme pills, I forget now, I got them but didn't notice a difference and eventually stopped taking them. It's not the end of the world, I just need to time my toilet breaks accordingly.\n\nThat is the key thing here, pooing is rarely an emergency (if you are not ill), he can schedule it better. I am a single parent. I've never needed to poo with my kid, or leave my kid alone. I just pooed while he slept. He would wake up every four hours like clockwork, day or night, to drink, til he was three. Sleep deprivation was crazy but pooing was never an issue, obv I went while he slept.\n\nYour husband is using the toilet to avoid doing the work of parenting. And it is work. But what he and others don't grasp is it is not just work, it is also an expression of love. Your kid will likely not remember any of this, but at this young age it is being imprinted on them, this parent can meet my needs, this parent cannot. Is that what he wants to be the foundation of his relationship to his kid? And how will it affect the kid, feeling like a parent doesn't consider them worthy of being the recipient of an expression of love, even when expressing that is labour.\n\nHe really needs to understand that bit.

My very apathetic dad was also like this, would spend at least 30 mins in the bathroom as soon as he got home from work, every mf day.  \n  \nI have a vivid memory from when I was about 3, still being potty trained, begging at the door to use the potty, I really had to pee. Eventually, I peed right there on the floor in the hallway, and he still hadn\u2019t come out.  \n  \nFor things like this, among other reasons, my mom left him shortly thereafter.

Just start doing it a bunch until he gets the picture. If he starts to protest, hand him the baby while apologizing for walking away but you\u2019ve really gotta go, and then we\u2019ll talk.

Two of my friends have a great system where when dad comes home from work he spends an hour with baby, and mom gets a break to take a shower/nap/do something for herself.

There are better times to make him spend time with the baby when he needs to shit is not one of them. Also do you not have a crib or a baby stool or a sucker? Does the kid not have a safety toy? There are items that can make someone who can\u2019t calm a baby for shit calm a baby easily (it just takes a bit of experimenting to find said item I recommend a sucker and a small blanket or bear works wonders on most kids) Now for the 30 minute thing\u2026 just take his phone\u2026 but anyway you will always be the AH if you make someone hold it in for something that isn\u2019t an urgent matter.
