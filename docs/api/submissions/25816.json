You likely chose to start a family with him because you believe he\u2019ll be a great dad, so it\u2019s borderline offensive that he doesn\u2019t seem to try. But if you live in one of the many societies which teach gender roles, he has been indoctrinated with the idea that he can\u2019t do it.

And it can get boring so you need to pass the time somehow.\n\nHOWEVER! The timing here is rather suspect. If this is a daily thing that always happens at around the same time it's one thing. But if it only seems to happen when you need help with the baby, it's likely an avoidance thing. 45 minutes is also a really long time... At a certain point it's time to pack it up and try again another time.", "That may well be true, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that dictating when your partner is allowed to use the toilet, and for how long, is an absolute no-go and a huge red flag.", "Upvote from me!\n\u2026..but You\u2019re prob a F. \nJust accept that we all do different things that goes unnoticed in a relationship. \nDeal w/it. At the end, we probably end up on the plus-side. Crossing fingers.", "God, I was 7 months pregnant at Disney world trying to pee and change a 2 year old on my lap.  Mothering is hard sometimes.", "Literally had to hold the baby while we (me and the baby) were both vomiting intermittently due to a virus the whole family caught.  He can learn to comfort a crying baby for at least a little while... This really isn't about the toilet.  He just needs to step up more often and to give mom some help.", "lmaoooo i\u2019m sorry that\u2019s cute and annoying at the same time", "Even with IBS, you shouldn't be sitting there that long. Google it. 15 min tops. It can cause all kinds of problems.", "Ya this is fair. It is a pretty common thing for dads to escape to the toilet to go on their phones etc. (it was even in a Paul Rudd movie I\u2019m forgetting the name of). I wonder what his reaction was to her saying no and wish OP had elaborated how the interaction played out", "Ah okay. I\u2019m not a mom, so I honestly I didn\u2019t know that. Rather I didn\u2019t think of that.", "Sitting on a toilet for too long is the pathway to MASSIVE hemorrhoid issues (not to mention other problems down there).  My husband used to read on the toilet.  Many, many doctors told him to stop doing that and that if stuff isn't moving, DON'T keep sitting. Get up.  Walk around.  Come back if you need to.  He does have digestive issues, but he did the exact wrong thing and now has had to have two surgeries that were no joke!  Don't make the toilet your relaxation place.  That is absolutely stupid, and any doctor who deals with these types of issues will tell you the same thing.  Shit or get off the pot people.  It's not playtime!  Also, no mom staying home with young kids gets 30 minutes by herself in the bathroom.", "I agree with others who have said bring baby with him.", "Oi, flashbacks. I think I\u2019d blocked out when my mom, myself, my 5yo, and my 14mo all had a stomach bug. I took the baby to an urgent care since we were traveling and they did what they could (nothing). Mom called her doc who said he couldn\u2019t help us\u2026 but called in about triple the amount of zofran one person would need.", "It\u2019s bad for you but if you\u2019ve got intermittent spurts of diarrhoea for half an hour, you\u2019re gonna stay there", "Mate, not everyone is the same. I mean I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not medically recommended but people do what\u2019s comfortable when they\u2019re feeling sick. I have a friend who absolutely will sit on the toilet for that long when he has bad diarrhoea (which is often), which is a combination of the bouts of actual shitting (which can be intermittent over like 15, 20 minutes), and feeling more comfortable sitting hunched on the toilet than getting up in between said cramps/bouts. I could tell him to Google it \u2018til the cows come home but that won\u2019t change the fact that that\u2019s how his body works and how he manages that condition. I\u2019m just saying - there\u2019s no one way that everyone deals with this stuff.", "I don't think you understood the \"other end of the spectrum\" part of their comment. They are not talking about sitting and trying for that long. They are talking about active activity. It doesn't matter what google says you cannot just flick an off switch while a waterfall is happening", "Agree", "I don\u2019t have kids either haha. But when I had my nephew for the first time I called my sister to ask what I\u2019m supposed to do if I had to poop and she was like, \u201cuh door open or put his bouncy seat on the floor while you go.\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Also, when they get a little older, they will follow you into the bathroom anyway.", "Yeah I'm talking about like 10 minutes or so if you feel like you're not totally clear after the first round. Not sitting around for 45 minutes at a time. Not sure what all the downvotes are for here, I'm not saying the guy it right, I'm saying he's wrong.", "Oh yeah.  Those stomach viruses will knock out everyone in no time.  Me, my husband, both sons, and my mom got it!  We still have ptsd from that.", "Well, the more you know. It made me change my habits when I found out. \n\nTo each his own.", "I don't think what you are suggesting is humanly possible. You are saying his friend is having more than 15 min of straight pooping? 30 min? How would his friend even know this? Diarrhea comes in waves, and you should not be on the toilet in between. That's all I'm saying. \n\nBut in any case, the guy in the story is not having 45 min of straight diarrhea without his wife seeing some obvious physical changes. I think we can agree on that at least.", "I used to have one of my nephews stand outside the bathroom door and sing to me or talk when I had to go the the bathroom. He was an escape artist from about 2 and a half to 5. I don't know how many times I had to say \"Your voice is getting farther away.\"", "Haha..every day we learn something new \ud83d\ude04", "Damn. \ud83e\udd72", "I get it.  Digestive issues happen! My husband has real digestive problems he just didn't follow his doctors' advice and lived to regret it.  Those surgeries were bad.  I mean, I was angry at him for ignoring his doctors, but boy, did he pay for it!  I felt bad for him then.  Yikes!"]}
