But if you live in one of the many societies which teach gender roles, he has been indoctrinated with the idea that he can\u2019t do it.

I've been to a doctor, they suggested IBS but weren't really sure and didn't seem to think it was worth investigating further. They told me to get some kind of enzyme pills, I forget now, I got them but didn't notice a difference and eventually stopped taking them. It's not the end of the world, I just need to time my toilet breaks accordingly.\n\nThat is the key thing here, pooing is rarely an emergency (if you are not ill), he can schedule it better. I am a single parent. I've never needed to poo with my kid, or leave my kid alone. I just pooed while he slept. He would wake up every four hours like clockwork, day or night, to drink, til he was three. Sleep deprivation was crazy but pooing was never an issue, obv I went while he slept.\n\nYour husband is using the toilet to avoid doing the work of parenting. And it is work. But what he and others don't grasp is it is not just work, it is also an expression of love. Your kid will likely not remember any of this, but at this young age it is being imprinted on them, this parent can meet my needs, this parent cannot. Is that what he wants to be the foundation of his relationship to his kid? And how will it affect the kid, feeling like a parent doesn't consider them worthy of being the recipient of an expression of love, even when expressing that is labour.\n\nHe really needs to understand that bit.

The bottom line is that he's not going to learn unless he does it.  Can you leave him alone with the baby for 2 hours on the weekend while you go shopping, for example?  Not unusual for the stay-at-home-parent to be the one who knows the baby's rhythms best, while the other parent feels competent and important at work, then comes home and is completely at a loss with the baby, so avoids the situation where he feels incompetent.

HOWEVER, y'all have said to just read a book on parenting or watch a youtube video.... these things are a nice resource, but the vital part of learning how to deal with a baby is hands on with proper help.
