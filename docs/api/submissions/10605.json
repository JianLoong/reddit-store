Taking the gift back may not have been the right thing to do at that time, but I honestly don't know how else it could've been handled.

I think she would've learned her lesson that way also without it looking like you favor one over the other.", "YTA. A gift given is not yours to take back.

I think I'm going against the grain here by the looks of it.\n\nI think this probably was effective as far as teaching Sarah not to bully someone in front of a gift giver, but this whole situation is likely going to have caused even more resentment from Sarah towards Alina. I'm not sure that you'll have done either girl any favours as far as their relationship goes in the long run.\n\nYou went out of your way to provide a very generous and thoughtful gift. You spoke with Alina and saw how understanding she was about the differences in need between herself and Sarah. It doesn't sound like (and do correct me) Sarah's parents were stepping in to mediate the situation. Your gift was used by Sarah as a tool for bullying (i.e. OP doesn't love you and the laptop symbolises that). \n\nI think others are right that it was technically wrong to try to retract a gift that had been given, but seeing as that gift was being used to bully someone who you presumably feel protective over I struggle to fault you for it. There were probably better solutions, but in the heat of the moment you've removed the catalyst for bullying, essentially. Perhaps it would have been better to keep hold of the laptop rather than regift it in front of Sarah though. How old are your nieces? It sounds like they're of an age when they would understand the gravity of their words.\n\nI'm going to go NTA for now, but curious to read more of the other perspectives here!", "Yta...you don't take a gift back.\n\nWhat you do is buy your neice a car for her next birthday....and make sure you neice knows it's just for her...not her step sister.", "YTA - you don\u2019t teach kids how not to be an AH by being a bigger AH - kids do that kind of thing to each other all the time and it\u2019s a moment to teach them right from wrong not punish them for not knowing better. Shame on you", "YTA - Once you give a gift, it is no longer yours. \"Taking it back\" to give to someone else is messed up. While I do not support bullying, there were other ways of handling it. Perhaps it would have built a better relationship between the girls if you indicated that you had asked Alina's approval before deciding to give the gift. Instead, you (an adult) decided to bully a child as retaliation.", "ESH\n\nSarah obviously is an AH for bragging about the laptop and trying to make Alina feel bad. However, they're siblings. That's kinda how the sibling relations work.\n\nHowever, YTA for not handling it better. You didn't need to take back the present, which is in itself pretty rude, but you could've scolded Sarah, or explained to her that you love them both equally, but you decided to help Sarah, or any other solution.  \nUnfortunately you only escalated the situation, turning a teasing into a good reason for Sarah to harbor resentment towards you or her sister.\n\nAnd threatening your brother to stop helping him financially was a very AH move too.", "YTA\nGift comes from giving.

NTA OP. In all honesty, \u201cmy real niece\u201d seems kind of cold but also it\u2019s true. You don\u2019t have to have a familial connection to in laws.

Maybe you could have said you would not give her that kind of gift again if she used it as a way to humiliate others. You could have added that on the other hand, your niece understood why you didn't give her the computer and tried to be much nicer with step niece. That would have been enough. What is worse is not that you took the gift back but that you gave it to your niece, confirming the idea that this is all a competition between them. You should have thought of ways to deal with the problem fairly without making it difficult for them to ever get along. The step daughter was wrong but you have just enabled the bad dynamic there. Also how old are the girls? If they are less than 13-14 you are a massive AH.\nPs : I re-read your post, you make it all a part of pressuring your brother. You help people financially or you don't, you have a right to say no, but it's super wrong to put pressure on someone in exchange. You definitely think people ought to live their life a certain way to deserve your money, and this often sucks (except when ppl don't spend the money for what they asked or sth). It seems you made this whole affair a way to express your resentment at your brother for having to help him.

You said yourself she has had a tough upbringing. Maybe she hasn't learnt how to deal with situations like this. Maybe no-one has taught her properly how to deal with multi-family dynamics.

How would you feel if you got an awesome gift and then someone said \"oh you're behaving like an ass so I'm taking back my gift\"? You'd rightfully think *they* are the asshole.", "I agree it's not how she should act and the parents should have acted promptly. But OP is still in the wrong.", "\"Facing consequences for your actions\", as I have commented elsewhere, is a trite and meaningless statement. *Everything* is a consequence of your actions, it doesn't provide any justification for it. Let's say you say something rude, one time, to a schoolmate, who then spends the next three years making your life hell by bullying you because of that insult. The bullying is a \"consequence of your actions\". Hope this helps.", "I mean I don't know about the law over there. Where I live the object is in the name of the person who bought it. But I guess the family is very welcomed to sue the aunt if that's the law and see how that's gonna go for them long term when they need money from her.", "I mean, yeah OP doesn\u2019t say how long the parents have been together but it\u2019s disingenuous to say that acting this way is just how sibling relationships work. I have siblings, we might argue or rib each other but I would *never* say that someone in our family loved me more/didn\u2019t love them based on a gift I received. That\u2019s a fucked up thing to say to someone. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine that with Sarah telling Alina her family doesn\u2019t love her they have anywhere close to a sibling relationship.", "Did you read the same story? Sarah was a completely ungrateful jerk who instead of appreciating what she got, decided to bully her stepsister.", "She learned the golden rule. Those who have the gold, make the rules. It's a terrible lesson to learn, but what can you do?\n\nI believe in retaliation by promotion. OP should have bought a better laptop for the niece...", "SIL should've reprimanded her kid on the spot but didn't according to this post, so I doubt she would've done a damn thing.", "This is where you are wrong: you\u2019re assuming everyone is a good parent and they\u2019re gonna do their due diligence and parent their own child. This is not some stranger at a restaurant, this is OP\u2019s niece. You\u2019re also calling OP an asshole for witnessing bullying happening in front of them and doing something about it. So are you saying you would rather watch someone get bully and **hope** someone does something about it after you leave?", "Yes it\u2019s interesting that the ages of the girls isn\u2019t mentioned. I\u2019m guess barely teens at most. More probable 10 ish", "You think OP buying her a new laptop every year and letting her act like a bully is giving her a better life?", "Yeah I would get my money back.", "(Not u/EinsTwo answering) \nBot account u/Positivtgfgfd took the remarks from u/LucidOutwork (who posted 20 minutes earlier).", "A few minutes of being rude?? If she\u2019s willing to say that in front of guests it means she pretty comfortable saying stuff of that nature, comfort comes from repetition she\u2019s been \u201crude\u201d before. Sure bullying may be extreme but she fully deserved what she got.", "Being rude is pointing out how much better her new laptop is than her step-sister's older laptop. Repeatedly saying that someone's aunt/uncle doesn't love them is straight up cruel.", "What technical definition of bullying are you using that says Sarah wasn't bullying Alina?\n\nIt's not only folks with impairments or disadvantages that can be bullied.", "Oh yeah because someone saying something nice to you could never be overshadowed by someone being horrible. It is bullying. \n\nBullying: To seek to harm, intimidate or coerce.\n\nSarah did *seek* to harm Alina, whether she actually did or not, it's bullying. NTA OP.", "The age is not stated anywhere else.", "It is. You got something you bullied your stepsister because of something and then you don't have the something anymore and the person you bullied has.", "Last I checked, there wasn't really a contract which stated that OP \"gave\" it to his stepniece.", "I'm getting distinct \"i'm a minor\" vibes from your obsession with this idea.", "Yk I really have a feeling you're the stepniece. Caught you in the act, Sarah.", "Lol. It's not, though, unless you're not a person but a chatbot who only knows how to parse language literally and not with the context normal humans are accustomed to.", "OP, I think this needs to be in your post. A lot of the y t as seem to be assuming the parents would have addressed the bullying if you had not intervened but it doesn\u2019t look like it. NTA and you\u2019re a good uncle to Alina", "How old are your nieces? I'm guessing 12?", "And you believe the solution was for OP to bully Sarah? And her brother?\n\nThis was a power play. I have the power to control the people in this house & take away if I don\u2019t like the behavior. It\u2019s pretty simple. No one here knows the dynamic between Alina & Sarah. Based on the information provided... Sure take the laptop back & let Sarah earn it back but giving it to Alina showed OP\u2019s true motive. I\u2019m in charge here. No lesson was taught or learned here. Oh... except now Sarah has a good reason to be angry.", "And that's why that behavior will continue. Let's just all bully eachother until it stops.\n When you learn that's not how adults handle situations things are handled better. \n\n This will only increase any resentment.

If I witnessed my niece doing something I would call her out of it and say that it\u2019s unacceptable but would not deal the consequences. Not once did I say or infer that bullying was ok in any way! You\u2019re reaching on that. \n\nYou might be right though in saying that I\u2019m expecting all parents to be good parents.", "I don\u2019t think the lesson that actions have consequences is bullying. These aren\u2019t 5 year olds", "Yeah she was rude, I agree. I don't agree OP was in any way right to take the laptop back. Apparently the kids are 8 years old. KIds that age, especially who are siblings, especially especially who are in new families and don't know where they stand, very often talk like that to each other. Removing a prized birthday gift is absolutely a terrible way of reacting after just one incident. Damn people are so harsh on this sub.", "Something something something. It's still trite and in no way offers any kind of justification for OP.", "Well I don't know gifting things works where you come from, but in the civilised world you can't give something and then take it back because the recipient does something to upset you.", "Lol you're funny, Alina.", "Can you explain how it isn't? You do something to someone they don't like, they do something to you that you don't like. A bit like in OP's post, which you seem to agree with. I feel like you aren't really giving this much thought. What happened this month by the way? You referred to something this month earlier.", "Everyone in your extended family is supposed to act like the universe has been overwritten and these folks are and have always been family, because you got married and gained a stepkid? Really? \n\nWhat planet do you live on?", "She\u2019s not trying to control her and she\u2019s not bullying. She\u2019s disciplining and punishing, since the mom won\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have power to control people and nothing I read made it sound like that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing.\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s been generous and they\u2019re mooches. Actions have consequences and she\u2019s entitled to give or not give as she pleases. She doesn\u2019t owe her brother and his new family a thing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting conditions on her generosity. If the brother and his family don\u2019t like it, then they can be adults and make do without.", "Check OP's replies. The parents brushed it off.", "It would have been one thing to take it away and have a talk. Instead they took it from one and handed to the other. The lesson they learned while they didn't mean for them to was that they just aren't loved like the other..", "She was well beyond rude. Where do you see that they are 8 years old? I don't see any comments by the OP that mention their ages.", "Op is right. And this is a lesson for parents you can raise a bully brat but the world won't put up with them. So it's better if you teach them yourself.", "Let me help you understand.\n\nIt's the laptop he bought with HIS money.\n\nHe is not obliged to buy his stepniece anything, it's his choice if he wants to consider her his niece.\n\nShe was ungrateful and taunted that over Anna. For all I care, she should never recieve another gift untill she gives a thoughtful apology to her.", "Dearest darling, sometimes you lose the things you were given because you handled them poorly.

I would be in this page all day haha. That would be good information to add to the post though. As someone else pointed out, maybe I\u2019m expecting every parent to be a good parent.", "I saw it in another comment but maybe that person was mistaken about the age.", "Listen sweetheart, I can be just as patronising as you. You really don't think OP could gave handled the original situation better without resorting to the nuclear option? I think you are the one who should grow up.", "That's not what I suggested, unless you're looking for someone to be against extended families. \n\nIt's just that your decision with regards to your creating your family doesn't change how other people feel about newly introduced folks overnight. Expecting them to, because FAAAAAAAMILY is on par with giving your employees a pizza night and expecting them to be happy with their lack of raises. You can do it, but expecting the result you expect is insane, you have not done any of the work to earn the response. \n\nYou can't make people flip switches in their brains because it suits you.
