Taking the gift back may not have been the right thing to do at that time, but I honestly don't know how else it could've been handled.

I think she would've learned her lesson that way also without it looking like you favor one over the other.", "YTA. A gift given is not yours to take back.

I think I'm going against the grain here by the looks of it.\n\nI think this probably was effective as far as teaching Sarah not to bully someone in front of a gift giver, but this whole situation is likely going to have caused even more resentment from Sarah towards Alina. I'm not sure that you'll have done either girl any favours as far as their relationship goes in the long run.\n\nYou went out of your way to provide a very generous and thoughtful gift. You spoke with Alina and saw how understanding she was about the differences in need between herself and Sarah. It doesn't sound like (and do correct me) Sarah's parents were stepping in to mediate the situation. Your gift was used by Sarah as a tool for bullying (i.e. OP doesn't love you and the laptop symbolises that). \n\nI think others are right that it was technically wrong to try to retract a gift that had been given, but seeing as that gift was being used to bully someone who you presumably feel protective over I struggle to fault you for it. There were probably better solutions, but in the heat of the moment you've removed the catalyst for bullying, essentially. Perhaps it would have been better to keep hold of the laptop rather than regift it in front of Sarah though. How old are your nieces? It sounds like they're of an age when they would understand the gravity of their words.\n\nI'm going to go NTA for now, but curious to read more of the other perspectives here!", "Yta...you don't take a gift back.\n\nWhat you do is buy your neice a car for her next birthday....and make sure you neice knows it's just for her...not her step sister.", "YTA - you don\u2019t teach kids how not to be an AH by being a bigger AH - kids do that kind of thing to each other all the time and it\u2019s a moment to teach them right from wrong not punish them for not knowing better.

Perhaps it would have built a better relationship between the girls if you indicated that you had asked Alina's approval before deciding to give the gift. Instead, you (an adult) decided to bully a child as retaliation.", "ESH\n\nSarah obviously is an AH for bragging about the laptop and trying to make Alina feel bad. However, they're siblings. That's kinda how the sibling relations work.\n\nHowever, YTA for not handling it better. You didn't need to take back the present, which is in itself pretty rude, but you could've scolded Sarah, or explained to her that you love them both equally, but you decided to help Sarah, or any other solution.  \nUnfortunately you only escalated the situation, turning a teasing into a good reason for Sarah to harbor resentment towards you or her sister.\n\nAnd threatening your brother to stop helping him financially was a very AH move too.", "YTA\nGift comes from giving.

NTA OP. In all honesty, \u201cmy real niece\u201d seems kind of cold but also it\u2019s true. You don\u2019t have to have a familial connection to in laws.

Maybe you could have said you would not give her that kind of gift again if she used it as a way to humiliate others. You could have added that on the other hand, your niece understood why you didn't give her the computer and tried to be much nicer with step niece. That would have been enough. What is worse is not that you took the gift back but that you gave it to your niece, confirming the idea that this is all a competition between them. You should have thought of ways to deal with the problem fairly without making it difficult for them to ever get along. The step daughter was wrong but you have just enabled the bad dynamic there. Also how old are the girls? If they are less than 13-14 you are a massive AH.\nPs : I re-read your post, you make it all a part of pressuring your brother. You help people financially or you don't, you have a right to say no, but it's super wrong to put pressure on someone in exchange. You definitely think people ought to live their life a certain way to deserve your money, and this often sucks (except when ppl don't spend the money for what they asked or sth). It seems you made this whole affair a way to express your resentment at your brother for having to help him.

It's also Sarah's aprwnts place to discipline her more than yours, so you could have gone to them about it. In this case, though, I think Alina needed to know that someone was going to advocate for her. Behavior like this is indicative of a much bigger problem.

That's going to make the family dynamic all that more combustible. And, Sarah still will be in need of a laptop, and Alina will have a laptop she could use but doesn't need.

I would worry this will cause more resentment from your step niece towards your niece. Your post doesn't mention their ages, but it sounds like your step niece is old enough that she should know that you shouldn't act like that after being given a gift.", "YTA, once the gift is given you cannot take it back", "NTA not your fault Sarah is ungrateful and disrespectful. Also a bully. You did the right thing and chances are your brother won\u2019t stick up for his daughter to keep the peace. So never turn your back in your niece- she needs to know someone is in her corner", "NTA\n\nIdk if I'd have given the laptop to Alina straight up (solely because of the backlash it would cause, not because Alina doesn't deserve a laptop), but taking it back was justified and necessary in this situation", "You have never over fed a starving dog.

Instead of being grateful, the attitude is, well I\u2019ve never had it before so it\u2019s not a big deal if I continue to go without. Especially when having that thing comes with strings attached, in this case being nicer to the stepsister. Not an excuse to bully her stepsister, but she probably is never going to see you as the saviors you are making yourself out to be. \nI probably would have given Sarah the opportunity to apologize first though.", "What Sarah did was reprehensible and she shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to keep the computer. I agree with taking it from her. I don\u2019t think I would have given it to the other child because that will create even more problems, it may have been better to give her an opportunity to earn it back. \nRegardless, I hope that you sit down with Sarah and explain to her that you took the gift away because she used it to hurt someone, and that is not allowed. I grew up with little to nothing (my parents technically had money but my mom was a cancer patient and spent months at a time in the hospital or on the couch throwing up from chemo for most of my childhood) so when I didn\u2019t have birthday parties or haircuts or new clothes the children around me told me my parents must not love me. It sounds like Sarah may have experienced things like this, so when someone gave her something she considered a huge gift she didn\u2019t know how to handle it and used it to punish someone whom she felt has more than she does. It\u2019s completely wrong, but she needs to receive guidance in understanding why it was wrong and learning healthy ways to express her feelings about how she\u2019s been treated and the things she\u2019s lived through. She also needs to know, like every child does, that she is cared for even when she acts out. I know it\u2019s difficult to like her when she hurt your niece, but if you can manage it that will go a long way towards helping her become a better person. My older sister helped me, I got to go to an ice cream drive through with her every Saturday after dinner if my mom said I had earned it.

But you could and should've handled that a bit better, they're just kids, didn't need to be that extreme. Maybe would've been better if you'd have gone with a warning first before just taking the laptop which is a bit extreme imo.\n\nBut protecting someone from being bullied is never being an asshole in my eyes.\n\nI just want to know what on earth were the parents doing while the bullying was happening?", "YTA. \nTrue, it doesn\u2019t sound like she deserved the gift, but you didn\u2019t give it to her because she deserved it.

It does sound like discipline was indeed in order, but it\u2019s not our place to punish our sibling\u2019s step-children. \n\nDefinitely, TA.", "What you did was technically left and I have to say YTA because of that.  Once that was given to her, it was no longer yours to take back.\n\nShe should have been taught a lesson a different way.", "Why is your brother regularly asking you for financial help? It's not really smart to marry someone with a kid and a bad job if you're already financially unstable. Or is this since he married her? I'm asking because I wonder if you're already sick of all of this. \n\nIt seems you are financially supporting Alina to a degree and you were willing to try that with Sarah but not at Alina's expense. This makes total sense to me. \n\nI think NTA. The idea you can't take a gift back is hilarious. Of course you can take it back and of course you did that. Giving it to Alina probably wasn't the best idea but at the same time I'm amazed you bought a laptop for a girl you barely know. I think this was your welcome to the family gift and she spit on it. \n\nFrankly, I would focus on Alina from now on and I would watch my brother carefully because he sounds like he might let Sarah do whatever to make his wife happy. \n\nAnd yep, you commented that they went 'oh they're just kids' and 'she's kidding.'

When Sarah began bullying Alina, the girls should have been sat down and had a conversation with about how there are enough bullies in the world already, and how family should look out for each other.  (I realize this is idealistic, but it can still be taught in a helpful way.)  Sarah has probably never had that security and is relying on badly learned coping mechanisms/responses, but she's still young enough to learn better if the parents can PULL THEIR AZZEZ OUT OF THEIR EGOS for 5 minutes and do a little mature parenting.

That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole I don\u2019t think in these circumstances, but I would never do that.\nAlso as everyone else has pointed out; as an aunt you don\u2019t have the same rights to punish children. And a side note for you to do that on her birthday is particularly nasty! And yeah, you did kinda ruin her birthday!

Maybe to teach her a lesson, give Alina a more expensive thing or just spend more time with her, I guess. I'm not defending sarah, but I cant help but think that because she doesnt have enough for most times, having something as expensive as a laptop gave her too much joy that she went a bit... wild?

If this is true, her mother should have taught her better, Salina was pre-warned, and Sarah should have received a reprimand and not received it immediately until she apologized and was told that this is not how they should act. In her world, Sarah just won the lottery. All she has known is 'tough-life' aka poor.

No doubt this probably comes from resentment that she did not get as much due to her family situation, but that still does not make it right.

She may have been bullied herself.  What she said was wrong, but she\u2019s a kid.  Kids can be mean sometimes, and they need setting straight sometimes, but you massively overreacted.  This could and should have been dealt with through the medium of conversation with both of the girls and with their parents.  You can have a problem with what she said and not demonstrated even worse behaviour. You acted worse than a kid. At least a stroppy kid takes their ball home, but you just dumped the ball into your niece\u2019s lap to deal with.   Not good at all   YTA", "Yeah, you are the A.  The gift was a GIFT, and once given you do not demand its return other than because it turned out to be a duplicate gift.  No matter how badly Sarah behaved after receiving your gift, it's not right to yank the gift back from someone who obviously has not had a happy or excessively-gifted life prior to becoming part of your extended family.  You didn't give ages, but this sounds like freshman high school behavior or maybe late middle school (since both girls need laptops presumably for school, and Alina has had one for 3 years).    \n\n\nYou should have interrupted Sarah's little taunting/bullying session with a word about family love: \"I love Alina,  have loved her since the day she was born and became a member of the family.  I love you, as the *newest* member in the family.  In our family, we don't compete for love and affection, we give parties and gifts and cake and ice cream on birthdays and special occasions because we all love each other and are happy to be in each other's company.\"", "&#x200B;\n\nESH\n\nI mean Step niece is still without computer for school and now your other niece has two. Tbh it's very strange for a step niece to say things like this, like what lead up to this? How long has the step niece known you? It was definitely something to do with taunting her own step sister. But I guess she got a pretty brutal punishment. I hope she can get a computer someday. \n\nThe step niece seems to conflict with her new step sister and I'm going to assume this also has a lot with her background and how her environment affected her. Is there anyway for her to make amends and apologize to at least get this resource back? \n\nI mean did sara really needing a new computer? I would have not given it to your neice, because it also just show you do indeed favor her more...but I guess it's the whole knowing her long and being biologically related.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nin way you do suck, which it could be a very unpopular opinion\n\nI think the step niece needs love tbh.", "I mostly agree with standpoint. Sure it\u2019s not very effective to trying to mend the issues at hand, but it sure does send the message that actions have consequences and that they will catch up to you soon or later\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fault OP for acting in lieu of the parents allowing to go on with zero interference, which in itself is a troubling sign because of how much more could have been going before OP saw what they saw\n\nNTA primarily due to intent since OP couldn\u2019t sit there and allow a bully to be a bully for free", "I think ESH except Alina. OP is only TA for regifting it in front of everyone and taking it away in front of everyone in a knee jerk reaction, but not for taking it away in general, that is indeed warranted but not without a conversation. That is of course assuming this type of behavior isn't constantly happening and thier ages (assuming 9-13). So many people like to say fuck around and find out but don't understand the long term effect of these actions. This is NOT going to change her behavior for the better like most people think it will. Did she learn a lesson? Sure, but not the right one. Now she knows to not say anything in front of OP and saves it for later. I would have handled this completely differently. I also think having kids vs not having kids and the style of parenting plays a role in many of these responses. \n\nShe 100% needs a lesson but not like this. Idk if this was party with lots of people or just the immediate family but I would have told Sarah to let's go have a chat at some point. To me it seems like since the parents didn't step in they either don't care or didn't notice. A simple \"Sarah, thats enough\" is fine for the moment. Even taking it away and telling her we'll talk in a minute is OK. No kid likes being reprimanded harshly in front of the whole family, they absolutely remember that stuff, they will be defensive and difficult. And she will most certainly remember the regifting/taking away in front of everyone, and not only resent OP for that but her sister as well. They (OP) could have held off on making any drastic moves until a little bit later when the right opportunity comes (like after gifts or whatever). Doing what OP did in front of everyone, a kid is far more likely to act out, get more frustrated with OP, sister, etc. And harbor more resentment. This is not going to make whatever bullying any better. When you give them a moment, have a deep conversation with them away from the party and then apply consequences they are far more receptive to it and a much greater chance of truly correcting the behavior long term.\n\nI've always been one to sternly say my daughter's name and tell her to stop or that's enough, wait a moment, depending on the circumstances, after the event of whatever misbehavior and take my daughter to the other room to talk about what happened. \n\nIn this case if I was OP (given the lack of parenting and seeming like I would need to step in the first place) I'd ask her why she feels like that was necessary to say, try to pull out (if any) underlying reasons she feels that way, why it was not ok, put her in the other persons shoes, some relevant life lesson, and make consequences for her actions. I would also explain the reasoning behind giving her the laptop and not Alina in the first place. In this instance a consequence could have been telling her I'm taking away the laptop for the time being. Until she shows she's genuinely sorry for what she said/did which includes making it up to her sister, changes her behavior and have them both do some type of fun activity together after. Laughing and doing fun things together puts whatever animosity in the past for alot of kids. \n\nAround this age parents have to provide the outline for kids to correct themselves and work/talk it out together like adults. It doesn't seem like the parents are doing much and if OP truly loves them both, simple lessons like this goes A LONG way. It doesn't mean they need to be parenting them but this was 100% a case where OP would be right to step in appropriately. \n\nAnd to add to the complexity it seems like both of the girls went from being the only child to having a sister. That kind of change is not always easy and parents need to recognize that to help both of them.", "I would maybe hold the laptop and tell Sarah she's not getting it back until Alina gets a proper apology. But if the parents really did nothing to step in, I don't blame OP for acting the way they did.", "I never support the actions of being a bully. I will admit I believe that sometimes it is a self defense mechanism, for example not having anything. (I don\u2019t support this mechanism I just acknowledge that it may be present).\n\nTo learn a good lesson, involves more than demonstrating a good lesson.  It also involves the discussion. Sharing with Sarah the why, (actions & consequences).  It also is important to discuss the methods to earn a change.\n\nA kid will learn \u201cwhat they see/ are taught\u201d.  I\u2019m curious if this behavior was learned through observation of the SIL, brother or both? Your niece appears to have been taught better (by who?). Is she with your brother primarily?\n\nAlso, niece  needs a safe place:\nHow often is she bullied? \nWill she be bullied more now that step niece lost laptop (by SIL or S niece, both)?  \nWill the laptop be accidentally broken in some manner so niece will no longer be able to use it (there is more than one to take computer away)?\n\nTime to show new examples, discuss alternatives, and relay that actions have consequences (such as was demonstrated).  For SIL & step niece to throw down an AH card with you will also have consequences. SIL needs to hear/understand that as well.\nM", "You would\u2019ve given it to the other one? Wouldn\u2019t just taking it back serve the same effect and wouldn\u2019t have caused jealousy and the blackmailing of her own brother and SIL?", "This is the answer. Using the original gift as a weapon is not going to enforce the lesson OP wants to send.\n\nPeople are simplifying this too much. It's not a matter of AH gets punished so it's okay. The way Sarah is punished for her behavior matters and the method OP chose is not going to achieve the results they want unless OP was trying to be mean. Either way it's ESH.", "But in honesty if you have given a gift and then you take it back it\u2019s stealing at that point. Not really a gift if there\u2019s strings attached then it\u2019s just wages", "ESH indeed. But I would argue that if OP merely gave Sarah a laptop needed for school then she should keep it. I mean, Chromebooks needed for school cost like $200, which is a lot for poor people but not a lot for people who can gift extended family members things. If anything, give Alina a new laptop, maybe even one that's better. It sounds like OP didn't think Alina needed a new laptop at all, but changed viewpoints merely to punish Sarah.", "Except Alina. An actual child. \n\nESH (except Alina)", "Yep. I wonder if Sarah was saying something she has been feeling. That it seems like Alina is more loved because she has more, and it makes Sarah feel really sad.\n\nSo she made the very bad decision to lash out at   Alina, saying the thing to her that she felt about herself.\n\nAnd OP kind of reinforced that feeling a little bit by taking the laptop away when she was angry at her step niece and giving it to her niece, who had shown herself to be more deserving of it. It makes it seem like gifts are really tied up with moral behavior and approval.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t excuse the obnoxious behavior, but I can imagine Sarah is having a hard time. After all, OP had Alina\u2019s back so hard that OP grabbed a laptop out of Sarah\u2019s hands to protect Alina. Does Alina have anyone who is looking out for her like that?\n\n(And did OP really think Alina would take Sarah\u2019s claims at face value when she is Alina\u2019s aunt with a long history as a major figure in her life. Sarah\u2019s behavior was dickish but I don\u2019t think it was going to scar Alina.)", "In what fucking universe does saying your aunt doesn\u2019t love you to your stepsister okay? It doesn\u2019t matter their dynamic. Op barely knows the girl.", "Exactly!! Taking the gift away from one and giving it to the other just pits the nieces against each other.", "Even as teenagers I seen my close cousins fight because the blood relative always gave the blood member better gifts, and they would tell them it's because they love me better as I'm their actual blood. \n\nIt doesn't excuse the behavior in any means, but teenagers and kids are cruel to eachother when parents aren't around and don't always speak on it afraid to not be heard. So if by being the poor kid she was always told \"well I got this cause they love me more blah blah blah\" then her first reaction might be to finally be the one to say it. While again it doesn't justify it, it could be part of it.", "She did not get a new laptop - she'll live.", "How old are they? But it was a one time thing\u2026 Have you thought of now and in the future your going to look like  at AH and a bully. Especially if she grow from this.", "I wouldn't put a 'final' moratorium on nice gifts to Sarah for just one instance. She should have a chance to redeem herself, otherwise there's no point to her improving her behavior.  It's quite obvious she won't get any correction or motivation to improve from her parents, so wanting to get in YOUR good favor might be the only thing that saves her.\n\nA calm talk with her might advance that. \"Do you understand why I did that? I'd like to treat you the same as Alina, because you're my niece, too. But I'm not going to reward you for being mean and a bully. But if your behavior improves, I'm willing to give you a second chance.\"", "Would you cut your \u201creal\u201d niece off if she made a mistake? If you found out that she had been mean to her step sister or some kid at school, is that all it would take for you to be done with giving her gifts and supporting her?", "Swift karmic retribution is so satisfying.", "If you don't teach someone like Sarah at a young age, she will continue bullying people. The mother and his brother can learn from it too, because it sounds to me like his brother has married a person who probably isn't a very nice person (hence her daughter picked the behavior up from example) and he's now afraid to stand up for his own daughter and make his wifey-poo mad. But that will definitely be a core memory for Sarah, she has probably learned that even if her mom castrated her hubby and wears his nerds around her neck, the uncle is not someone who plays around when it comes to his niece and bullying. NTA", "OP doesn't care. If the step niece becomes resentful. Look at how he uses money to bully his bother. He views money as a tool of control and punishment. He seeks to control everybody with his money. A big red flag.", "Right because then the apology would be totally sincere", "In my opinion this could have been a perfect time for a teaching moment. I'm not sure how old the girls are, but this is most likely a combination of insecurity and immaturity.  No one is condoning bullying, but using this moment to reset and reaffirm boundaries for the future would have done more.\n\nTaking away the laptop was an apt punishment, but then giving it to Alina to rub it in even more really wasn't needed, at least not without a thorough debrief afterward. For example. \"I want to support and give you nice things, but using it to bully your step sister and spreading a hurtful lie you know is not true is unacceptable. If you can't accept your gift humbly, then we just won't do gifts anymore.\"", "He said his SIL and her daughter (so, Sarah) and probably his brother think OP is an asshole. He never mentioned his niece's reaction."]}
