Taking the gift back may not have been the right thing to do at that time, but I honestly don't know how else it could've been handled.  Sarah was definitely in the wrong for saying what she said to Alina, but maybe it would've been better to just take the gift back and not give it to Alina.  I think she would've learned her lesson that way also without it looking like you favor one over the other.", "YTA. A gift given is not yours to take back. Nor is someone else's child your responsibility to punish. You could have said, \"Sarah, if you want to get any more nice gifts from me in the future, COOL IT.\"  And then spoken privately to your niece about how much you love her.", "YTA\n\nThis should have gone to the parents to.. parent. Instead you held money over there head and completely overrode them. Big AH move. \n\nWhat you should have done is gone to your brother and SIL and explained what Sarah said to Alina, expressed how this upset you, and requested that they reprimand Sarah.", "NTA.", "NTA!!!! It is exhausting to excuse horrible behavior because the culprit is a kid. You were right to reward Sarah\u2019s bullying accordingly. The world doesn\u2019t need another young person growing up to be Marjorie Greene.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI would've done the same and added \"I gave that to you because you NEEDED it. Not because I love you more.\"", "YTA,  this should have been a teaching moment, instead you just came across as an immature idiot.", "YTA - its not your job to punish your nieces. You should have gone to the parents and let them deal with it - also using financial help to control your brother is a huge AH move too.", "YTA\n\nStop parenting your niece & step-niece. They have parents.\n\nThe lesson you taught here was: how to be petty, immature & manipulative\n\neta \u2014 did it ever occur to you to speak to your brother, his wife & ask how they wanted to handle it? Or what about if you just took a minute to talk to both girls to explain what the actual issue was? How hard would to be to let Alina speak for herself & for the adults to let Sarah know that her use of the laptop would be determined by her behavior.", ">I told my brother that he doesn't dare take this away from my niece and if he does then he'd better remember to never ask me for any financial help\n\nYTA - This goes beyond the present. You're actually threatening them more broadly over this. You're holding something over their head and trying to control behavior when it's not your place.", "Tough one. I think I'm going against the grain here by the looks of it.\n\nI think this probably was effective as far as teaching Sarah not to bully someone in front of a gift giver, but this whole situation is likely going to have caused even more resentment from Sarah towards Alina. I'm not sure that you'll have done either girl any favours as far as their relationship goes in the long run.\n\nYou went out of your way to provide a very generous and thoughtful gift. You spoke with Alina and saw how understanding she was about the differences in need between herself and Sarah. It doesn't sound like (and do correct me) Sarah's parents were stepping in to mediate the situation. Your gift was used by Sarah as a tool for bullying (i.e. OP doesn't love you and the laptop symbolises that). \n\nI think others are right that it was technically wrong to try to retract a gift that had been given, but seeing as that gift was being used to bully someone who you presumably feel protective over I struggle to fault you for it. There were probably better solutions, but in the heat of the moment you've removed the catalyst for bullying, essentially. Perhaps it would have been better to keep hold of the laptop rather than regift it in front of Sarah though. How old are your nieces? It sounds like they're of an age when they would understand the gravity of their words.\n\nI'm going to go NTA for now, but curious to read more of the other perspectives here!", "Yta...you don't take a gift back.\n\nWhat you do is buy your neice a car for her next birthday....and make sure you neice knows it's just for her...not her step sister.", "YTA - you don\u2019t teach kids how not to be an AH by being a bigger AH - kids do that kind of thing to each other all the time and it\u2019s a moment to teach them right from wrong not punish them for not knowing better. Shame on you", "YTA - Once you give a gift, it is no longer yours. \"Taking it back\" to give to someone else is messed up. While I do not support bullying, there were other ways of handling it. Perhaps it would have built a better relationship between the girls if you indicated that you had asked Alina's approval before deciding to give the gift. Instead, you (an adult) decided to bully a child as retaliation.", "ESH\n\nSarah obviously is an AH for bragging about the laptop and trying to make Alina feel bad. However, they're siblings. That's kinda how the sibling relations work.\n\nHowever, YTA for not handling it better. You didn't need to take back the present, which is in itself pretty rude, but you could've scolded Sarah, or explained to her that you love them both equally, but you decided to help Sarah, or any other solution.  \nUnfortunately you only escalated the situation, turning a teasing into a good reason for Sarah to harbor resentment towards you or her sister.\n\nAnd threatening your brother to stop helping him financially was a very AH move too.", "YTA\nGift comes from giving. You gave it away and had no right to take it back. Sarah's behaviour should have been dealt with in a different way.", "A lot of Y T A\u2019s here. That\u2019s crazy. Didn\u2019t realize that just because her brother got married she\u2019s just supposed to automatically care about these people. She gave the girl a gift, the girl then rubbed the gift in her nieces face to the point of tears, she then took back the gift and gave it to niece because why the fuck would she want a bully to have a new gift from her? NTA OP. In all honesty, \u201cmy real niece\u201d seems kind of cold but also it\u2019s true. You don\u2019t have to have a familial connection to in laws. Because that\u2019s what they are \u201cin-laws\u201d as in the only thing making you even remotely related is the law.", "YTA, there were plenty of other ways to deal with this, like say, scolding your step niece, or explaining before everyone why you gave her that gift. Maybe you could have said you would not give her that kind of gift again if she used it as a way to humiliate others. You could have added that on the other hand, your niece understood why you didn't give her the computer and tried to be much nicer with step niece. That would have been enough. What is worse is not that you took the gift back but that you gave it to your niece, confirming the idea that this is all a competition between them. You should have thought of ways to deal with the problem fairly without making it difficult for them to ever get along. The step daughter was wrong but you have just enabled the bad dynamic there. Also how old are the girls? If they are less than 13-14 you are a massive AH.\nPs : I re-read your post, you make it all a part of pressuring your brother. You help people financially or you don't, you have a right to say no, but it's super wrong to put pressure on someone in exchange. You definitely think people ought to live their life a certain way to deserve your money, and this often sucks (except when ppl don't spend the money for what they asked or sth). It seems you made this whole affair a way to express your resentment at your brother for having to help him. Maybe supporting him has been a burden and that's totally understandable but don't put the children against each other to express your own resentment.", "How old is everyone here because you're all behaving like children", "NTA Kids need to receive consequences for mistreating people. You would have been harming the girl more had you let her get away with bullying her stepsister.", "YTA.  That was an overreaction, and you could have used your words instead.", "YTA, your comments seem to indicate that you probably were going to take the laptop away no matter what.  \n\nShe\u2019s a kid who by your own omission has a pretty tough life, and now you\u2019ve made it even tougher by punishing her for a childish mistake. \n\nShe supposedly made a few stupid comments and now you\u2019re done with her forever? Yeah you\u2019re an asshole.", ">At Sarah's birthday I gave her my gift and she seemed very happy however I heard her bragging to Alina, telling her I don't love her.\n\n\n\nESH, I don\u2019t think you handled it well. This will lead to more resentment and fighting in your nieces home.", "NTA. She absolutely deserved what happened. You taught her a lesson. She shouldn\u2019t have acted in such a malicious way", "YTA\n\nSarah needs to be taught manners and bullying Alina is not okay.
