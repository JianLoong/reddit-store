The job market, specifically sales is always tricky when it comes down to needing a degree or not. Bottom line, if you have the option to go to college for little or no cost, go to college. You\u2019ll gain a ton of work and life experience that can be applied to your career and beyond. Sure you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a degree to be a sales professional, but employers do prefer candidates who have a degree.", "If you\u2019re serious about wanting to be an entrepreneur, a business degree would do you a lot of good.  Lots of small businesses fail or stay one-man operations because someone has a great idea but doesn\u2019t know how to do the business management side of things.  Yes, a small number get very lucky and manage to get big without the background, but it\u2019s rare. Only 25% of new businesses make it 15 years, and that\u2019s counting the one-man operations.  Things like advertising and pricing and scaling up take knowledge to do right.  Working part time in sales or marketing while doing a business administration degree would give you both practical knowledge of what the front line looks like along with learning how the stuff beyond pure sales works.\n\nNAH, but if you\u2019re serious about wanting your own business and not a purely sales career, you\u2019d be hobbling yourself by not going to college.", "NTA if you dont go to college. However, I personally think that you should go. Its easy to look at the successful people that didn't go to college and say \"Hey look, they did it!\" Yeah, but there are just as many if not more people who made it just as big and did go to college. At the very least it could help you network and find in roads with people in other avenues of business.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents have that old school belief that if you don't go to school you won't succeed in life. This simply isn't true. I dated a guy not too long ago that was very wealthy, mid-20s and never went to school. He did sales for a few years to get experience and then opened up his own business.\n\nAt the end of the day, you *cannot* allow your parents to dictate your future. If you do not want to go to school but still want to honor your parents, then grind and get it done. You're 16 and want to go into sales. That tells me you've got realistic aspirations. Sales does *not* require a formal education.\n\nNo matter what, you're going to disappoint your parents initially. Let them kick you out, grind like there's no tomorrow, and make it. Once you've made it, your parents will change their tune. At the end of the day, they just want what's best for you. They simply believe that a formal education will give you stability and security. This is true if you want a regular 9-5, but if you want to be your own boss, there are very few professions that require you to be formally educated. Does it help? Sometimes. The connections and alumni alone can propel your business to new heights. But, you'll be ahead of the game in-terms of debt and real world experience.\n\nBest of luck to you. I made the mistake of listening to my parents and spent years unhappy in my profession.", "What you should actually go for is a degree in Business Management. You want to get into entrepreneurship you would be well served with the networking such a degree provides and the skills it teaches you to get the most out of your opportunities. You can use a Business Management degree to get into most things because is so versatile.\n\nNAH", "NTA \n\nYou have a passion and a plan but just make sure your goals are achievable without a college degree.\n\nGoing to college is a major expense. You will be in considerable debt and no way to get out of it. \nSo you really have to pick a major that can be your plan B if entrepreneurship doesn\u2019t work out; or go to college for free.\n\nYou\u2019re 16, and you work at American Tire. What is the job growth potential there? What is the maximum earning power? If you get kicked out, how fast will you be able to save money to start a business? Is your income enough to pay rent and living expenses without parents\u2019 help? These are things to consider.\n\nFor me the ideal situation would be to work for a company that will pay for your college as a benefit.\n\nAnother thing you can consider is a finance degree, and then you can try your hand at financial sales.", "NTA for not wanting to go to college\n\nIf you want to make adult decisions, you need to accept the responsibility and consequences for those decisions.    You know they will kick you out of their house if you decide not to go to college.\n\nYour choice to not go to college means that you will need to move out of your parent's house and take on all the bills yourself (rent, insurance, medical, etc), essentially becoming an adult.  You are not entitled to any money they have saved up for your college education.  It will most likely be put toward their retirement.\n\n2 out of the three people you spoke to had college degrees.\n\nWill be 18 years old with only 2 years of work experience applying for the same job a 21 year old with a business or marketing degree and likely an internship under their belt?  Once you have a job, you can go and show them your expertise to impress everyone, but until you have that job, there really isn't anyway to show a potential employer that.  If you're lucky, your hiring manager is someone who already knows you.  If they don't know you, you're at a major disadvantage.", "You claim to be 100% set on a sales career, yet are open to the idea of college. Your parents see this indecision as a betrayal of the sacrifices they've made. You ask if you're an \"asshole\" for not wanting to go to college, yet you acknowledge that a degree \"helps\" and you've spoken to successful people who've been to college. You see your parents as potentially narrow-minded, yet you seek their approval and worry about their judgments. Are you the visionary who knows better than his parents, or are you the unsure teen who could risk his future by ignoring traditional pathways to success? YTA for asking a question to which you already know the answer, yet refuse to fully acknowledge. You're not throwing away their sacrifices; you're challenging the very framework that gives those sacrifices meaning. And that's a power you may not even realize you have.", "NTA\n\nRepeat after me:  A college degree does not guarantee success.  Not having a college degree does not guarantee failure. \n\nAlso repeat after me: Your child not going to college is not a sign of failure as a parent.  Refusing to support your child as they forge their own path in life is a sign of failure as a parent.  \n\nAlso you're 16 and you have a couple years yet to really consider what path you want to take.  Don't rule out college/education but don't stop looking for other opportunities for growth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I went to college,  I regret it.\n\nFurthermore, college isn't something you necessarily need to do immediately after high school.  That's a standard thing frequently, but you're not pigeonholing yourself by following your career first to see what happens if that's what you want.\n\nIn fact, it's not uncommon to get a degree later when you're roadblocked by promotions.", "INFO\n\nDo you work now?\n\nDid their \u201csacrifices\u201d include saving for your tuition and living expenses?", "NTA but keep in mind that you learn a lot of things at college, not just the information from the academic side. A history major also learned a lot of other things that helped them be successful. You can absolutely make a great living in sales but keep in mind that most of those jobs are commissioned based pay, so not always a steady paycheck depending on what you sell. The college experience will provide you with a lot of skills, socially and academically so it\u2019s worth at least giving it a try for a semester or 2, worse case scenario is you drop out.", "NTA. I'm you at 40. Didn't do university (college for Americans) and went straight into entry level sales. Moved through different variations of it and I earn more than most I know with degrees, I love my work, have work life balance and a lot of perks. My parents hated I didn't do uni but I'm much more successful than pursuing a career I would have had no interest in, and I'm happy.\n\nStick to your guns, sales is honestly a really good career if it's something you enjoy.\n\nETA I've also been in sales management, and 4 years sales experience is looked up on WAY more highly than a degree. Even if it's in a basic, entry level role. Sales is results driven, if you've done 4 years you're at least capable. A uni degree tells an employer nothing about your sales ability.", "> wealthy\n\nI rest my case. \ud83d\ude02\n\nJokes asides, I do agree that you could be successful without degree, but that percentage is small. However, even with a degree it doesn't mean you're successful immediately.

I know plenty of self-made individuals who didn't go to school and are what anyone would define as \"wealthy\". At least they're very good at making it appear that way.", "Not in sales. A degree means absolutely nothing in sales. Put the time you'd put into college into a basic sales role and you'll be way ahead of a graduate going for the same job.", "Maybe tell them what I said, that you are considering going later in life?  I'd at least try that first.", "What about my first question?", "Every time i bring up going later or doing a gap year they say its not an option whatsoever", "oh yes im working now, at Americas tire", "The good news is you have 2 years until your college aged. Get as much customer facing, preferably sales experience as you can part time. Retail, doing test drives for dealerships, direct sales, telemarketer, anything. You might see it as a shit job, an employer will see it as you willing to do the hard yards in a shit job to gain experience to get where you want, especially when you sell it that way in the interviews. I started in door to door sales, and employers loved I could take the rejection of that industry and keep going. I'm now a state territory manager, still in sales at 40 and loving it", "did you go to college?", "I went to Australia college, but I think that's like senior high for you, it's like ages 16-18ish.
