I\u2019m very close to the heart of the city, and I live in a rundown neighborhood with very old houses. My neighbor has never talked to me in the 2 years I\u2019ve been living next door. However, I\u2019m very familiar with her, because her tabby cat, Charlie, is always outside. I\u2019ve been guilty of giving him treats before and whenever he\u2019s on my porch I give him all the love. However, she never lets her cat inside, so he\u2019s always roaming around the neighborhood. \nLast week I was driving home late from work. It was about 10:30pm and pitch black outside. I was pulling up to my house when I head a thud. I stopped the car immediately because I assumed I ran over something large enough to mess up the front of my car. Unfortunately, it was my neighbors cat. I picked him up very gently and ran to my neighbors doorstep. He was gone. I apologized profusely and she was very understanding that it was an accident; honestly, she didn\u2019t even seem sad. I felt terrible about everything and even baked her a pie the next day. I would never intentionally cause harm to the poor thing, he was such a sweetheart and I was very fond of him. I was very thankful she was so understanding of the circumstance. \nFlash forward to two nights ago. I got a knock on my door, and there my neighbor was. She mentioned she wanted to get a new cat, and was looking at buying a purebred Siamese. I felt off about the situation in an instant because first of all, adopt don\u2019t shop, but if she was going to pay upwards of $900 for a cat, it would be extremely irresponsible to never let her cat come inside especially when we\u2019re so close to downtown. I asked if she would be keeping the cat outside, and she said yes. \nThen she sprung it on me: she wanted ME to buy the Siamese to make up for the accident with Charlie. I am not by any means wealthy; I live paycheck to paycheck and have two roommates. I told her I would not be able to afford a purebred cat from a breeder, but I was willing to provide the funds for her to get a cat from the shelter ($90-120 instead of nearly $1000) and she refused. She said it was my duty to pay because it was my fault that she no longer has a cat.\nI feel awful about everything. Like I said, I never wanted to hurt her cat, not in a million years. However, I really cannot afford to spend $1000 when I can barely pay my rent. \nSo, AITA for not wanting to buy her a purebred cat?", "created_utc": 1667360654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjuk33/aita_for_not_wanting_to_buy_my_neighbor_a/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wants to \u201cupgrade\u201d at your expense.  Yuck.  If it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault that she no longer has a cat, it\u2019s hers.  Losing your cat to an accident is one of the risks of having an outdoor cat.  Indoor cats have 3-5 times the lifespan of an outdoor cat in the US.", "NTA. This person needs a plush toy cat, not a living, breathing furry friend. Even if you pretend the ask isn\u2019t exorbitant (it is!), she seems entirely unwilling to care for an indoor cat, which Siamese cats tend to be.  IMO you\u2019re well within your rights to decline the request. \n\nTLDR: No is a complete sentence.", "NTA. I am an animal lover. I have 2 16 yo cats ATM. Why? They are indoor cats. The life expectancy of a cat permitted to go outdoors, if the numbers have stayed the same as a few years ago, is 3 yo.  IMHO, that is generous. Your neighbor shouldn\u2019t leave her cat outside. I  very sorry for the cat. As far as the legalities of it, I am sure that varies place to place. It was her property, but she was negligent with the property. I am an animal lover but they do call animals property. If she wants a replacement cat, I think it would be kind of you to offer, BUT certainly not a designer, purebred cat. Seriously?! Outrageous.", "NTA\n\nNot your responsibility.   She was an irresponsible cat owner.\n\nAlso, no reputable breeder will sell a purebred cat to be kept outside.   The adoption contract clearly specifies that the cat must be kept inside at all times.", "**NTA**\n\nIt was an accident caused by your neighbour forcing her cat to roam around at night. \n\nIt is nice of you to offer to pay for the shelter fees. Please don\u2019t allow your neighbour to take advantage of your guilt.", "NTA. The only cat I\u2019d be buying that lady is a Fur Real Friend and maybe a few extra batteries out of sympathy.", "NTA\n\nThis was an accident and totally the fault of your neighbor for being an  irresponsible cat owner.\n\nYears ago our son was driving home in our neighborhood, when he was driving down on our street the neighborhood kids were playing and running back and forth between houses, he slowed down but didn't see one of the neighbor's small dog run in front of his vehicle to try and join the kids on the other side, unfortunately he hit it and the small dog died, he felt terrible. This neighbor started coming to our house everyday and demanding $500.00 for the dog. After the fifth time my husband called the Sheriffs department, they came and looked at the video of neighbor's visits, they left and then came back and told my husband he wouldn't be coming over anymore, the unwanted visits did stop.\n\nOP, you are being generous to offer pet adoption fees for the shelter but this neighbor is a negligent pet owner.", "NTA, don't enable her to get another cat she won't care for. I'm so sorry this happened. RIP kitty.", "You are not liable. In fact she\u2019s responsible for whatever damage was done to your car because she allowed her animal to roam (well that\u2019s the rule here anyway). \n\nNTA. She\u2019s taking advantage of your kindness but it was entirely her fault the cat was run over.", "NTA. She can't even force you to buy a cat. She's delusional. If I bought a Siamese the damn thing would never leave my house to live outside and suffer the same Fate as Charlie. I'd have laughed in her face and told her to go to hell. Any cat I buy I'm  keeping. And shut the door in her face. You don't owe her a new cat. That is exactly why you keep your cats inside.\n\nIt's a known fact any outdoor cat has a 3-5 year lifespan on average. Indoor cats can live as much as 20 years. it's the neighbors fault her cat is dead. She left it outside ro get run over. it was only a matter of time.", "NTA\n\nIrresponsible pet owner is trying to scam you.\n\nStand your ground.", "Nta. She probably shouldn't have a cat at all. I grew up with indoor/outdoor cats. Lots of them. Why lots? Because they all fucking died really young. I probably had 10 cats during childhood. \n\nIn the last 20+ years I've had 5 indoor cats. One died young due to illness. The next two each lived 16 years. The current pair are 5 years old. \n\nI can't imagine having to tell my kids their cat died over and over they way my parents had to with me. Team indoor cat all the way.", "NTA but Siamese are not a designer breed. How\u2019s, a responsible breeder will not sell a cat or kitten to someone who lets their cat run wild outside. Ethical, responsible breeders want to know what happens to their kittens, where they will be housed, the living situation, etc.", "NTA\n\nI would not be willing to pay for a cat that would be left outside.", "NTA. It\u2019s her fault for leaving the cat outside, if she hadn\u2019t, the cat would never have been hit. She\u2019s an irresponsible owner.", "NTA She should not have a cat just to leave it outside all the time.", "NTA. Her negligence is the reason the last cat died. She shouldn't be trusted with a new one, pure-bred or otherwise.", "NTA. The cat is dead because of HER. If she'd taken proper care of her pet he wouldn't have been in your driveway to start with.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her a designer cat. A breeder will (if they have any sense at all) refuse to sell a cat to someone who lets it outside. It\u2019s normally part of the agreement to keep them indoors, for many reasons. \n\nI had a cat years ago who was allowed out - it\u2019s common in the UK, and our area was quiet. He lived to a ripe old age. But if I were to get another one now, though I live in the same place, he\u2019d be an indoor cat. Roads have gotten too much busier, and people have gotten too much meaner.", "NTA. It is entirely the pet owner's responsibility to keep their pet safely contained. Having your cat killed by cars, dogs, poison, snakes and all other manner of dangers is the risk you take if you let your cats roam outside. OP didn't deliberately aim to hit the cat; they are not at fault. Expecting OP to foot $1000 for another cat that she will let out to get run over is rediculous. If you have car insurance though, I would call them and discuss it with them. Then if she asks, you can just tell her to call your insurance and take it up with them. Let your insurance be the bad guys and explain why they are not paying for her cat.", "NTA and idk where you live or your legality\u2019s but locking animals outside 24/7 and roam off your property you can get charged for animal neglect and cruelty", "NTA on two grounds; she was irresponsible and she can adopt. She's a scammer that one", "NTA and not for the reason you think.  You, of course, are not obligated to buy her a cat, period.  She was the irresponsible one who allowed the cat to be outdoors.  You, also of course, are not obligated to buy her a purebred cat.  BUT THE BIGGEST REASON you are NTA is because your neighbor should not be allowed to have a cat, period, because she intends to have the next cat also be exclusively an outdoor cat.  You can't require that she keep the cat indoor but you should not be contributing any money towards a cat that will be exclusively an outdoor cat.  So if you feel like you have to pay something towards the new cat, I suggest you tell your neighbor \"If you want to buy a new cat and I see that you are keeping the cat indoors, I will contribute $100 but that will only happen after you've proven it is an indoor only cat for at least 3 months.\"", "Running over the cat was in no way your fault. The fault lies with the owner that let the cat be outside 24/7. Do not give her any money to buy any cat whether from a breeder or a shelter, especially knowing that she has no intention on actually caring for the cat. NTA", "NTA. If you let your cat outdoors, you are explicitly saying that you do not care enough about its life to protect it.  Cat owners who live their cats keep them inside.  I see no reason for you to spend a thousand dollars on a cat for her to ignore it and it die outside.  She's trying to scam you, ignore her.", "NTA, but there are valid reasons to get a properly bred cat. Because some people are irresponsible, does that actually mean all people must get cats with an unknown genetic history, without knowing what its likely adult size, body type, behavior, and other tendencies are?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
