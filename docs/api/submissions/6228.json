We've always thought she' a very nice girl and she seems to make my son happy, so no problem from us.\u00a0\n\nOur son has his own law firm that he\u2019s currently trying to get started. We\u2019re very proud of him, and we\u2019re fortunate enough to help him with a start up loan. DIL works a retail job, that she\u2019s very happy with.\u00a0\n\nSome time ago husband and I were over at their apartment and we decided to order some food. Husband and I wanted to pay, and since DIL were ordering from her phone we gave her our card so she could draw the money from our account. We thought it goes without saying this was to draw an amount once, for the lunch. However DIL apparently put our card into her Apple Pay, and have been using it since.\u00a0\n\nWe didn\u2019t notice for some months but recently saw withdrawals we didn\u2019t recognize. We had our accountant look into it, and he discovered that 1) DIL has been using our card on her phone and that 2) she\u2019s spend around 17K. We were quite shocked and called her up and asked why the hell she\u2019s been using our card. She got very defensive, tries to deny it and eventually said she was entitled to it, and why do we care since we haven\u2019t noticed her use over 4 months. We told her she needed to pay us back immediately or we\u2019d report her actions for theft.\u00a0\n\nShe apparently doesn\u2019t have the money to pay us back. We\u2019ve gone to our son and he\u2019s offered to pay us back even though he actually cannot afford to. This isn\u2019t about the money for us, but more about the fact that she\u2019s stolen a huge amount of money. While we are comfortable and it took us time to notice, we still recognize the seriousness of stealing 17.000 USD. Our son has completely dismissed her behavior and excused it as her being stressed. She\u2019s taken no responsibility, and we\u2019re honestly wanting to go forward with the police report to teach her consequences to her actions.

She has the information so do not keep is valid and cut it off.\n\nNow if you got the money back, would that make you happy?  After all if your son is going to pay you back, set up a payment schedule and let it be.  That way you are showing that you harbor no ill will and are content that you are being paid back.  If you take her to court, this will strain the relationship between you and your son.  So if he wants to take the financial hit for her, he needs to understand several things:  1)  That any and all financial aid from you is no longer on the table.  That this is all on him.  2)  That you will never trust the young woman ever again.  She has shown that she can not be trusted.  \n\nThe option to report this to the police is going to remain on the table, though if you do, the relationship between you and your son will be stressed to the point of him going NC with you.  So that would be the consequences of your action.  Though it may be short lived, cause chances are she will do the same thing to him as she has done to you.\n\nSo weight your options carefully, and make sure that the results are what you are wanting.", "NTA. Absolutely you need to move forward on this, as others have already pointed out.\n\nHowever, I suggest you talk to your son again about this from a place of concern so that he understands exactly why you're moving forward and is also forewarned that this is likely indicative of all sorts of problems.\n\n17K in 4 months for someone who works retail is a huge amount of money to spend. To put that in perspective, the average retail worker with more than ten years of experience makes $18-20 an hour. So even assuming she is well paid for her field, she probably makes less than $50k a year. So she spent over a third of her salary in just a few months and doesn't have that money to pay you back. That, and what she said to you, makes it really clear that she knew she was doing it and did not care. It also indicates she has been spending her own salary on top of that money (hence no savings). Which means that in the past four months she's spent an absurd amount of money. Probably $17K of your money and whatever her salary for 4 months is as well. That could be as much as $30k total. Which is not a small chunk of change, even for people in higher earning positions, to drop over 4 months. Spending at that rate would amount to spending $120K per year. That really begs the question, on what? Does she have a drug problem? Gambling problem? Online gaming problem? Shopping addiction? Is she having a manic episode? Is she paying for someone else? I think you can tell your son that all of this seems very out of character from the person you thought he was dating for the past two years and that you're concerned about her mental health and, of course, his by extension.   Point out that she must have been living way beyond her means over the past few months and say you're surprised he didn't notice. Mention that if she truly spent as much as it sounds like she spent there should be some tangible goods that could be resold to pay some of this back. If you have copies of the charges you can at least look and try to get a sense of what she's actually buying. Because someone spending that much money and willing to jeopardize their relationship with their partner's family and maybe their partner to in order to do so, is probably hiding something way bigger. He's probably so stressed and embarrassed right now, the larger implications aren't hitting him yet. Her being a liar and a thief is a problem, but this is beyond just \"stressed\" spending. You can lean into the part where he says she is stressed to say that you're concerned that this is her response to stress and you're worried about both of them long-term. You can suggest things like couples counseling, a financial planner, etc.\n\nYou can also model clear boundaries regarding trust and what you do when someone has broken trust by setting boundaries with her, and by extension him. So if he has a key to the house, change the locks. If he has access to any of your money or financial details from that start-up loan you need to cut that out. This is someone you can now not have over in your house unsupervised or allow access to any online log-ins. Any contact with them in the future, if he stays with her, should assume she may try something like this again. So this might mean altering your living will, power of attorney, and all sorts of other things. He needs to get the gravity of that.\n\nIn other words, I'd try one more time to approach this from a place of concern and state you're trying to understand why someone would do this and what they would spend that amount of money on. It's not going to do much right now, but hopefully it will plant some seeds for him. Because honestly, the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the amount was a woman I knew in college who would try to take friends' shopping on her parents' department store card using her mall employee discount, have those friends give her some cash in exchange for the items she bought, and then use the cash for cocaine.\n\nThere is obviously the problem of getting the money back/ dealing with the violation of your trust, but there is also the more strategic move of planting some sort of idea in your son's mind that says this behavior is not only not okay but also a sign of much greater issues. Longer-term, I'd be far more worried about the fact that he isn't treating this like a big deal. I'd be concerned he might know exactly what she is doing and not want to tell you or, alternatively, be so hoodwinked that he isn't taking in the sheer volume of money she stole and thinking about the larger implications.

Class G felony convictions are life-altering, and sentencing may include a prison sentence up to 10 years long. A convicted person may also receive fines worth up to $25,000.\n\nSome people convicted of credit card fraud will be required to pay restitution for their sentencing.
