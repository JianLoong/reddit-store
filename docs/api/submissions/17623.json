Technically I agree with you, but I think mild gracelessness in the face of major differences like this don't fall into AH territory.", "NTA. She's pushy, and it's simply true. You wouldn't drop a doctor's appointment to hang out with her--and that doesn't mean she doesn't matter at all, it's just reasonable to have priorities.\n\nShe's unsupportive of your choices. You can tell her you want to spend time with her, but *temporarily,* you have to focus on this program. You will graduate! If she were supportive, you could spend time together while doing things you need to do (walking a dog, grocery shopping, even a nice meal because we all gotta eat). But it's draining to try to do these things with someone who fundamentally undermines your choices.", "NAH. You are not AH for choosing your education and responsibilities. But she is feeling a bit abandoned and wants to feel like she is still important to you. It's just that you are in different stages of life and prioritise different things so starting to drift away.", "NAH- you're not wrong, but she's probably already pretty insecure about losing you as a friend and it probably hurt to hear it so bluntly.", "NTA\n\nYou told her you didn\u2019t want to commit time you don\u2019t know that you will have. You can try to let her know that once you\u2019ve gotten into a groove with your new schedule and settled into school that you\u2019ll be happy to talk about making plans. School and your future are important to you, and your friend should be supportive but can also be disappointed that she won\u2019t be able to spend as much time with you.", "NTA you have a lot on your plate and a real friend would support you instead of telling you to ignore what\u2019s important to you. You could have been a bit more tactful in how you said it but I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong for prioritizing your education health and home.", "NTA\n\n This is your future. Going to school, working full time and having health issues is a lot on your plate. Your friend should grow up, ofc there would be things that are more important than her in your life", "NTA you could have had a lot more tact but the message would have been the same.  She's probably hurt, which is understandable, but her hurt doesn't trump your education, health and responsibilities. Good luck in your studies.", "NTA.\nIt's always good to know where you stand.", "NTA but you still might wanna apologize to your friend, they could be feeling undervalued in their life for some reason", "You\u2019re correct if that\u2019s what you mean but YTA still", "NTA she feels entitled to your time. You cannot commit to anything at the moment and an adult should understand that.", "NTA\n\nNo one other than your own children is more important than moving your life forward in the direction you want. Not even your spouse. Spouses are a joint decision to move your lives together that you make every day. \n\n\nShe wants you to potentially damage your grades, lesson what you learn, and/or damage your eventual earning potential/job ability because she's insecure. That's a hard pass. \n\n\nPeople are friends because they get along, have things in common, respect their differences, and have a shared idea of what the relationship is. It sounds like you two no longer do. Unless she apologizes and understands your priorities (not makes them her own, just understands and respects them) there's not really anywhere for the friendship to go.", "Slight YTA. I absolutely get your side, you don\u2019t wanna pack an already busy schedule. But this is your friend, she probably took what you said as you ditching her completely. You could\u2019ve said it nicer, said something like \u201cI\u2019ll try my best but I don\u2019t know how busy I\u2019m going to be then, let\u2019s wait to make plans until closer to the date\u201d", "NTA education is so important she was frankly childish to push when you're so busy.", "I sympathise with you both. My best friend moved away for studies and it was tough but we did manage to make time twice a year. Mild YTA because I think you could have said you\u2019ll wait a bit to settle in and then make plans", "YTA for *telling* your friend that she\u2019s less important, which was your question, after all. You are not wrong in how you are ordering your priorities, but you need to work on your diplomacy skills when actually talking to someone you presumably value.", "I mean, I get your point but YTA - you basically told your friend she's bottom of your priorities and I know I'd be upset hearing that. You told her that you're dropping her because everything else in your life is more important. SMH.", "YTA, not for valuing education but for essentially telling her that everything (including chores) is more important than your friend.", "YTA,\n\nWhy are you even friends with this person? You lost a friend and yess you are big AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You wouldn't go hang with a friend instead of going to work, right?? Your education will get you hopefully a job that pays your bills. It's necessary. You've got a busy personal life, you can still have a social life, but not at the expense of your education commitments which are non negotiable. at the end of the day, she's not paying your bills, and she was trying to guilt you by saying you make time for things that are important, and you replied directly to what she said, to the point she raised. Her making out that she's important, you pointing out yes she is, but what is more important/comes first is not being an AH, it's just the truth. Especially not wanting to make commitments when you're unsure of what your load is going to be before then. Anyway, anyone who would rather you jeopardise your job or education over catching up, isn't much of a friend", "Your friend was just acting like a normal person, looking to make plans with a friend, but got shut down pretty hard. I suspect you were feeling a bit stressed about this new chapter and were seeking to manage expectations. Well. Now you won\u2019t have to worry about hanging out with her. Instead you\u2019ll make new friends in grad school to procrastinate with, but you\u2019ll feel better about it since they\u2019re in the same program. The fact is that even in the most demanding of programs everyone will still make time for what they really care about - people always do. \n\nYour delivery was not great, so YTA for that.", "Agreed. OP is not technically wrong but there are tactful ways of saying this without making a good friend feel like sh*t. You don't literally say \"you're not important right now\". NAH indeed.", "Nah, fuck that. OP clearly stated the much more tactful \"I'm not comfortable making plans that extend to when Grad School starts.\" and was met with their friend saying \"We make time for the things that are important to us.\" They had to be blunter.", ">telling your friend that she\u2019s less important,\n\nHe didn't. \nHe said 'not more important than'.", "Assuming OP is reporting accurately, they didn't say the friend was not important, only that they have responsibilities that are more important.", "So the next reply is \u201cYeah and I\u2019m not gonna make time for you\u201d ? Because that\u2019s pretty much what OP said. They listed all the stuff that comes ahead of their friend when she could\u2019ve said \u201cI\u2019ll try my best, but I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d"]}
