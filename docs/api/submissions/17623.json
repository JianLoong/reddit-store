It\u2019s something I have worked hard for, and something that is very important to me.  \n\nI was talking to a good friend, whom I\u2019ve known about half my life.  My friend does not put the same value on education that I do, and that\u2019s fine.  Different strokes for different folks.  However, she makes comments about the privilege of school and questions the validity of this path in terms of financial solvency.  \n\nLast week, she and I were talking, and she raised concerns when I stated that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with making plans that extend into the time when grad school has started, as I wasn\u2019t sure about how much time I would have.  Her response was that we make time for what is important, which I agree with in theory.  However, I will be working, going to school, and maintaining my home.  In addition, I have a pet who will need caring for and I have chronic health issues that require doctor appointments.  I said that she\u2019s important, but not more important than school, paying my bills, and managing my responsibilities (pet, health, home).  \n\nShe hung up, leaving me feeling like I had misstepped.

I thought I\u2019d get maybe 20 responses, lol.  \n\nA couple of people have asked and suggested that I edit with this information.

I do have trouble navigating social cues. (Not autistic or anything, and definitely not mean spirited, just\u2026 not my strong suit.)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m also a she.

You wouldn't go hang with a friend instead of going to work, right?? Your education will get you hopefully a job that pays your bills. It's necessary. You've got a busy personal life, you can still have a social life, but not at the expense of your education commitments which are non negotiable. at the end of the day, she's not paying your bills, and she was trying to guilt you by saying you make time for things that are important, and you replied directly to what she said, to the point she raised. Her making out that she's important, you pointing out yes she is, but what is more important/comes first is not being an AH, it's just the truth. Especially not wanting to make commitments when you're unsure of what your load is going to be before then. Anyway, anyone who would rather you jeopardise your job or education over catching up, isn't much of a friend", "Your friend was just acting like a normal person, looking to make plans with a friend, but got shut down pretty hard. I suspect you were feeling a bit stressed about this new chapter and were seeking to manage expectations. Well. Now you won\u2019t have to worry about hanging out with her. Instead you\u2019ll make new friends in grad school to procrastinate with, but you\u2019ll feel better about it since they\u2019re in the same program. The fact is that even in the most demanding of programs everyone will still make time for what they really care about - people always do. \n\nYour delivery was not great, so YTA for that.", "Agreed. OP is not technically wrong but there are tactful ways of saying this without making a good friend feel like sh*t. You don't literally say \"you're not important right now\". NAH indeed.", "Nah, fuck that. OP clearly stated the much more tactful \"I'm not comfortable making plans that extend to when Grad School starts.\" and was met with their friend saying \"We make time for the things that are important to us.\" They had to be blunter.", ">telling your friend that she\u2019s less important,\n\nHe didn't. \nHe said 'not more important than'.", "Assuming OP is reporting accurately, they didn't say the friend was not important, only that they have responsibilities that are more important.", "So the next reply is \u201cYeah and I\u2019m not gonna make time for you\u201d ? Because that\u2019s pretty much what OP said.

Grad school can be really demanding and it is wise to at least give yourself some time to adjust before committing to other things.\n\nBut, consider, depending on how close this friend is to you and how important their relationship is, that if they are feeling insecure about losing you, that perhaps some reassurance from you that they are still important to you would be a nice thing to offer.\n\nLook, their mental health isn\u2019t on you BUT they are a friend so just a thought.\n\nYes we make time for the things that are important. However, our resources and time are finite. Meaning sometimes we have more things we care about in our lives than we can manage at the same time and so\u2026 we make trade offs. We do what we can for what is important at the time it is important and then, hopefully, we make room to enjoy and honor those things we didn\u2019t have time for eventually.", "NTA. You were upfront about your concerns with your upcoming schedule and workload. Her saying that you make time for what's important was really not a nice or direct way of saying that OP's education and other life stuff are not. I have friends I don't see in six months. It's chill.", "NTA. \n\n>>\u2026we make time for what is important. \n\nAre we talking scheduling a dinner date, an all day trip back to the home town to visit the friend, an entire weekend away with friend? \n\nI think OP is taking the responsible approach to their program. They need to know the syllabus schedule of the grad program classes for the semester before committing to anything.  Committing and cancelling later is worse than not committing at all.  \n\nIf OP and friend are both local, then getting together will be much easier. Everyone has to eat. Grab a meal together. It doesn\u2019t have to be an all evening event. Let it be just dinner and a quick chat. If it\u2019s done often enough, it feels like normal catching up. Meeting up for lunch near campus works or grab some takeout and have a lunch picnic. It doesn\u2019t have to be drawn out to interfere with OP\u2019s schedule. \n\nOP probably needed to take a softer approach to the phrasing. The content was accurate, though.", "NTA.... you have yourself together... working school health your pet is more important", "You are NTA. I've been placed in this same situation and honestly you are 100% valid for creating boundaries that you are comfortable with especially since you have no idea what to expect initially. Your friend is in the wrong for trying to pin you right of the bat of a major and difficult life event.", "You acknowledged to her that you were going to be busy and she does not have the same respect for your priorities. \nI\u2019m graduating with my Masters right now, I completely understand. I always tried to make time for the people important to me but my family was always more important than my friends and other relationships, which caused some relationships to suffer in this time. Other people understood. Some just truly did not grasp how busy I was, even with trying my best. It was never ever enough. For some people, your best will never be enough. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, leaning towards NAH. I can understand that she is frustrated as well.\n\nI am in your situation kinda. Very busy with school and unexpected extra days, or people messaging me on my free days, plus health problems (extremely tired for no known reason). It sucks, but you can't make time if you don't have it, or do activities if you don't have the energy to do it. Education is extremely important, and your social life can hit an all-time low because of that. But this is a temporary situation that is extremely important for you future", "NTA. However I don't agree with \"we make time for what is important\" even the slightest. This comes from a privileged point of view. Your 24 hours and her 24 hours are different, because you both have different things to do and have differently abled body. If she can't accept it, that's on her. Not on you.", "#NTA\n\nThere will situations in your friend's existence where you can't be prioritized, so why does she take offense to the notion that she won't be prioritized all the time?", "NTA \n\nAs adults we have priorities. Which often, do have to come before friendships. You need a new friend.", "NTA. Your wording isn't great, but the message you were trying to send is true. Right now you have other responsibilities that are limiting your free time, and as a result it is hard to commit to spending time with her. You don't suddenly hate her,  and a good friend would understand that having less free time for friends is simply a part of a lot of people's adult lives, particularly if they know about your health issues. If you want to make amends you could still apologise for what you said, or at least how you said it, but I think it is possibly your friend is upset not just because of this conversation. Logically they might understand why you aren't always available to hang out, but it is possible she was already upset about something else when you told her you weren't free. Either way I'd say give her a while to hopefully cool down and then talk with her about it.", "NTA", "NTA. You want to keep the first little while you're in school open so you can adjust to it and see what your time commitments are. She should respect that.", "Interesting. Personally I have never had a friendship where, if my friend said something like this, I would have been offended. I have some really good friends that I care about, but I don't expect to be as important to them as their health or education or career or their adult responsibilities - so I think you're NTA.", "NTA. You were clear with her. Her inability to accept this is her own fault", "INFO - was there some event that your friend wanted you to commit to?", "NTA. Stupid people require stupid responses.", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. It sounds like your friend is not supporting your choice to go to grad school and is using your friendship to guilt trip you. \nI don\u2019t know what some people read, but I didn\u2019t see your response to her as anything but honest. You are expressing anxiety about how your life is about to change and trying to prepare for it. I don\u2019t have a friend who would choose to question my choice of education and career path. Aren\u2019t our loved ones supposed to be cheering for us? \nIt sounds like she is worried that you will move on with new friends and a the kind of career that she has no access to. Whether it\u2019s jealousy or fear of abandonment, something is going on with her, and that is what you both need to address. Maybe she needs a little reassurance that once you feel comfortable with the new schedule, you can find little opportunities to hang out and start to plan things.  Wouldn\u2019t it be great if she learned to be supportive and not focused on the negative things that may or may not happen?\nHang in there, OP. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in both friend\u2019s position and OPs position. Friend has blatantly stated she doesn\u2019t care about OPs path in the past. I think OP either needs to re-evaluate the friendship or work on more creative ways to stay in contact, but the older we get the less time we have for friends unless there are special circumstances and that\u2019s a natural way of growing up. We do make time for what\u2019s important, and sometimes even our best friends have to take second or third place. Seen it with besties growing up and having kids, seen it with besties having mental health crisis, but we\u2019re all still besties at the end of the day because we understand there are only so many hours in the day.", "NTA.\n\nTo all the people here saying NAH and lecturing OP about grace... come on, they are setting boundaries and have to repeatedly defend themselves from their friends pushiness and basically insults in regards to OPs life choices.", "Nta. You were a bit blunt. Perhaps you can apologize for how you said it, but not what you said. \nI hope you can remain friends, but this might mean the friendship has ran its course.", "NTA. Grad school is time consuming and expensive. Grad school can land you better jobs. I assume your friend isn\u2019t willing to pay your way in life if you fail grad school. It\u2019s called being a responsible adult and sometimes that means making sacrifices.", "I'm guessing you just finished college... Your friend sounds like someone who hasn't lived adult life because everything you said is 100% true. \n\nI understand your friend wants to spend time with you but tbh your friend is being selfish by not realizing you clearly are under some stress and only worrying about how you're going to make time for her when she should be supportive of you pursuing your dreams. \n\nIf she's a real one she'll realize this at some point. NTA", ">In addition, I have a pet who will need caring for and I have chronic health issues that require doctor appointments.\n\nAnd here's where you cross over from reasonable to clearly just coming up with excuses. Just be honest and tell this woman you don't value her friendship because you're too prestigious, or whatever.\n\nEdit: I can't imagine being such a loser you reply to someone and then block them. You truly are a redditor, Watercress.", "Well you just told your friend that she is unimportant. However your friend should not have pressed you in the first place. So I guess NTA? Maybe work on your delivery.", "NTA Your future can be dramatically improved by your plan being a success. It's a shame she doesn't see it that way, and therefore it's understandable that she's annoyed you might have less time to spend with her. It's a bit silly, as she ought to be supportive, but that's a small thing really. It probably stings to be told that she's less important than your plan in actual words, as it's already obvious. I think beint so blunt about it is your only mistake, and it's a social faux pas rather than anything serious. Most of the bad behaviour seems to be on her part, some people are a bit self-centred and others can be a bit sceptical of higher education for all sorts of reasons, but ultimately she should be supportive of your desire to do this course. Once she realises you've not ditched her, she'll come around even if she won't necessarily support you. That is, if you actually want  to keep her as a friend.", "You're NTA, but there are also ways to better communicate. I agree that your personal life, education and responsibilities should always take priority. However, maybe expressing those levels of importance to your friend, when she's reaching out because she cares about you and wants to spend time with you might sound hurtful. \n\nMaybe you should talk to her and express your concerns at a time when you are both open to hear each other out.", "NTA. I can only wish I was able to put down firm boundaries like you. I'm a doormat and I got stepped all over when I was trying to make time for my school. You seem to have no problem thinking of yourself first and making others respect you so that's really useful for you.", "Nta. You didn't say anything wrong.

Regardless, you\u2019re going to want and need a good support system when you\u2019re in grad school.

Was friend inviting you on a week-long vacation? Was she trying to make a plan for a dinner in June?\n\nI feel like, if the latter, you just might be the asshole, guilty of a thing I like to call \"time hoarding,\" which is when people are nebulously anxious about something impending and cope by arbitrarily walling themselves off and building a fortress around their calendar.\n\nIt sounds like you operated from an assumption that she would poo poo your new grad school because of things she said in the past and were preemptively defensive beyond what the situation called for, and as such, you hurt her feelings. Your friend was asking to see you and connect with you. You basically told her she's like, 23rd on your list, and tough nuggies, when you could have said, \"Yes, lets definitely get together in June! I need to see how my school stuff shakes out because I'm feeling pretty anxious about juggling it all. Can we check in once about this once school starts?\"\n\nEdit: OP provided additional context that is super important that basically friend wanted her to commit to something that would be 2-3 hrs a week on an ongoing basis with no clear end date, and that the thing would be social in nature and she's an introvert. Pretty clear NTA with that info.", "You are technically right about your schooling being important but now she knows where she ranks in your list of priorities - which is very low.\n\nAlso, ngl, this sounds a bit like a cop-out.

But the way ou handled it, it may just have cost you a friendship.\n\nBTW, this has nothing to do with her \"valuind education less\".

Her comment about \"we make time for what is important\" was kind of inconsiderate. Yes friendships are important, and we have to respect our friends if we want to keep them... but they're not a priority, EVER. If you gotta drop plans in order to better yourself then do it. If they're real friends they will understand where you're coming from, if not... well, you're better off without them. This doesn't mean you love your friends any less or are mean to them or are being malignantly selfish, either; life just changes and sometimes goals don't align anymore and plans are put on hold. I'm sure that if it was the other way around she would do the same as you and not bat and eyelash.\n\nPutting yourself first and foremost is one of the healthiest things you can do, specially if you're chronically ill.

Straight honesty doesn't always go down well.\n\nPerhaps you can make plans that are closer to home and don't require days of absence?\n\nWhat you may also find happening is a sway towards the extreme of work, studying, responsibilities etc, then a shift back towards balance. But it's very much about finding that balance. That being said, work I feel is definitely easier to manage than the pressures of studying. \n\nI guess, last of all: as someone who struggles to have relationships, don't take the relationships you have for granted.

I suggested that maybe on Sundays she came round my house and I would make brunch and we could go for a walk (thinking it would clear off some of her struggles as I could also give her a few reheat meals on Sunday for the week). She (through stress) went on on me about how I was trying to put myself above her responsibilities and her Uni course etc\u2026 was more important. \nI also stepped away so that we didn\u2019t argue and when I was calm I just explained I was concerned about her and had offered to help.

It\u2019s also very possible the friend threw out a comment like \u201chey, wouldn\u2019t it be fun to spend Labor Day at the beach this year?\u201d and OP used that as an opportunity to say \u201coh, I don\u2019t know, you know that\u2019s right about the time I\u2019ll be starting my masters program, and I\u2019ll just be so busy\u201d for the umpteenth time and it\u2019s grating on friend\u2019s nerves.

No one is expected to sacrifice their education, their future and their financial safety for their friends, but you are expected to make and effort and inconvenience yourself once in a while.", "Agree that OP needed to let friend know they don\u2019t have the same priorities. \n\nIMO opinion OP handled it correctly as the other way would be they accept every invite from friend and then cancels on majority of plans when close to the date. \n\nAnother possible option is friend is told likely not but they agree to touch base closer to date to see if still no or they can verify can do whatever.  Won\u2019t work on all things requiring scheduling weeks or months in advance but for other more flexible plans could be an option.", "I\u2019d say the same about the friend\u2019s guilt-tripping \u201cwe make time for what\u2019s important\u201d-comment after OP said - very reasonably- that she wasn\u2019t comfortable making plans before she\u2019s started the program. Instead of making OP feel like a lousy friend by slightly backing her into a corner, she should\u2019ve been supportive of OP in her endeavours and be happy for her. \nI\u2019d go as far as to say the friend is being a bit of a selfish A H by expecting priority over OP\u2019s own health, home and investment in her own future.\n\nNTA.", "Agree with it would be more tactful but being caught by surprise you can't always be on your feet and react tactfully. \n\nThe friend pushed this when op made it clear she is open to meet just doesn't want to commit now and have to cancel later which is respectful of both the friend s feelings and time . Instead the friend run over op s decision/boundaries to get a commitment she wanted", "But OP tried to gift a soft answer, and then even you said the friend \"bulldozed reasonable boundaries.\"  If the friend is so pushy, maybe they needed a blunt answer.", "Right, OP is fine to prioritise whatever she wants, but personally I wouldn\u2019t be friends with someone who was like this. Firstly being so blunt as to say \u2018you\u2019re not as important as my responsibilities\u2019, but also because they seem like someone who doesn\u2019t make time for fun in life. Sure a Masters degree will be tough, I\u2019ve done one and it was very stressful. But I always made sure to fit in time to have a laugh with my friends. I can\u2019t imagine being friends with someone who is just like \u2018I am going to work and maintain my house and my other adult stuff and that\u2019s all I can foresee for me.\u2019 OP is within their right to do that, but the friend is also within their right to take offence at that and no longer entertain that person", "Sorry, but actually anything relationed with OP's future IS more important than their friendship and people need understand this fact when they reach adulthood, it's not as if we can be forever kids where we don't Care about anything else than friends and Summer crushes, while maybe the phrasing was too cold, the fact is that the friend was inconsiderate as well and thought she's more important than OP's LITERAL education, in no reality it's true\n\nBills, education, work, etc is actually more important, no one survive in this world with the Power of Friendship \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 we need an equilibrium in relationships, and said equilibrium is establishing boundaries when people believe they're entlited to monopolize our time", "Why is kindness without truthfulness manipulation? What if you feel like it\u2019s not your place to be brutally honest, for example?", "Also I didn\u2019t see what kind of plans OP\u2019s friend was suggesting. I\u2019m chronically ill and honestly yes, it\u2019s really fucking hard balancing that with day to day \u2018adulting\u2019 for lack of a better word. \n\nI often had to cancel \u2018fun stuff\u2019 and some friends noticed and asked if anything would help like coming to mine, getting me an Uber and I said \u2018annoyingly no because I am just not well enough after doing the stuff you have to do like laundry and cleaning to be out in the world.\u2019 So my friend would come over an hour early while I got ready and clean. That way I could do both.\n\nEducation is important. Pets are important to some people. But neither are going to rock up to the ER at 3am in a medical crisis or bring groceries or meds when you are sick as shit all the time. Good friendship often helps you if you are chronically ill to balance up the other stuff.\n\nYou know how people are at sea when they have a baby and feel like their friends disappear or don\u2019t get it? Some of it is that when people know they are ill or pregnant or TTC, they step back a bit on friendships like getting cheaper insurance when broke. Then the big thing happens you and realise why sometimes small investments are worth their weight in gold.\n\nChronic illness will isolate you anyway. In my experience unless the person is actively problematic, do not burn friendship bridges when you are chronically ill. Buy them a small gift like a card and say \u2018sorry I can\u2019t make plans right now but I miss you and looking forward to thing when my calendar is clear.\u2019 I had a friend write a bunch of cards like this when her brother was dying and she was absent for all the big friendship things. She meant it too. It was as much her goal as a calculation.\n\nAnd you know what? She was incredibly supported when he passed and then when shortly after she had a baby. Because she triaged and showed effort. Banking it til later is how healthy adult friendships work.

Straight up saying you're not as important to me as this other stuff in my life, is a tactless and heartless way to say this. Sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it. And if you say something wrong, and someone takes it the wrong way, then you are partially at fault.

This doesn't apply to Op) \n\nI very much disagree on that final point. Relationships are effort, if you want to keep them you have to put in that effort. That effort can be a small amount, but if neither put in any effort ever to see each other or chat then your not friends. You don't \"owe\" your friend anything, but if your not committed to maintain a relationship in some form their not a friend anymore. \n\nHowever in Op's case a good friend would be committed to wait it out. It's clear Op's life is really busy and it's the honest truth that that friend is not the priority. I do think Op was harsh in how it was said, but sometimes that needs to be said. But on the same hand, I get why Op's friend might be upset. It's rough to hear. As long as they don't respond aggressively later on or anything I'd say NAH. \n\nThis subs whole attitude of \"you owe no one anything and anyone who asks anything of you ever is abusive\" is so toxic. Like, bro, you live in a society. If you want friends and family you actually gotta participate in being a friend or family member. It's the most online thing ever. Yes, if you like your friends normal people do actually expect you to spend time with them to keep them as a friend. That's not unhealthy to ask.", "Sure he could have negotiated it better.

Whatever it was, it appears that the plans required more time, and extend into school starting time. A two-week vacation? A pottery class? A plan to prepare for the New Year's Marathon?\n\nThen\n\n>Her response was that *we make time for what is important*, which I agree with in theory. However, I will be working, going to school, and maintaining my home. In addition, I have a pet who will need caring for and I have chronic health issues that require doctor appointments.\n\nI would feel flat out insulted with the friend's reply. If she is indeed a friend, she knows about the health issues and that OP has a pet that needs caring for. But the friend considers *these are not important*. I would take offense if a supposed friend said that *whatever plans she has* were important and my doctor's appointments weren't.\n\nStill, I agree that one wrong word can convey a really different meaning to something we are trying to express.\n\nI would not say that my issues are more important than *the friend*. But I would certainly tell the friend that my life priorities take precedence over whatever *leisure plans* she has, and therefore I was unable to commit to anything so far ahead.\n\nETA: NAH", "I agree with your completely and I think you explained what I said in a less emotional way than I did.", ">like, that shit doesn't announce flare ups nor crisis\n\nStill amazed at how many people completely overlook this fact, telling OP they should have \"bEeN nIcEr\". OP was nice. Friend wasn't hearing the nice message.\n\n>she's gonna throw a hissy fit at this\n\nDING, DING, DING!!! We have a winner.\n\nYou get the feeling that in the future this will be the same friend that can never do anything cuz money's tight, and ends up never actually retiring, just working til she can't?", ">Of course not, but I'm also able to say something like \"I don't know what my schedule is going to look like when school gets into full swing, so I'm not able to commit to scheduling something that far out.  Let's look at the calendar once I have a better idea about my obligations.\"\n\nAh, see? So you understand that some people are less important that other responsibilities in a priority scale.\n\nAlso, OP said that at first, friend pushed, OP went the blunt route. Even you admit friend tried to guilt trip her. So OP shouldn't have been firmer after that?", "Or worse, expecting others to drop everything to help her financially/morally.\n\nMy ex had a friend like OP and my ex and their group was OP's friend. I witnessed this same thing happen except the chronically ill part, the friend was pushed and shoved to the edge and had to resort to be exceptionally blunt and kick everyone except me and another guy out of his house to be able to work in peace. So I understand OP completely.\n\nA lot of people don't seem to understand priorities and boundaries... treating friendships like corporate treats employees.  \n\n\nETA: You blocked me? :'( What did I do?", "There's firmer, and then there's how OP responded.  That's my whole point.", "I don't feel like anyone here is technically an asshole, you guys just have different priorities. I do agree that you make time for what's important to you, but you placing high value on your education doesn't mean she isn't important. I personally believe it would be easier to make time for your friend planning something well in advance. Can you pick one day a month to hang out with her, and tell her it might have to be flexible? If you get absolutely bombed with school work, you may need to reschedule, and she knows that in advance.  You could have a quick meet up in the park with your pet, if possible. Probably wouldn't work with a cat lol. Or you could grab coffee/a drink/a smoothie? Or she could come over so you don't have to leave your pet alone.

Right now, it's that you're focusing on higher ed and she isn't, so she doesn't understand why you won't have time for her except for some during break.  Next, one of you might be focusing on a SO and not have as much time for the other unless and until you're in a position to occasionally double date.  After that, one of you might have a job that requires a huge amount of OT, and it will be hard enough to retain your romantic relationship and fitting in occasionally seeing your family of origin.  Finally, if either of you have kids, that's going to consume you for years.  Once that happens, often either the parent wants to hang out with other Moms and Dads who can relate to their daily struggles, or the friend gets tired of everything revolving around the kids.  You can't feed the friendship until you get to the other side if you have no gas in the tank after your life partner, job, kids, support system of other parents and family of origin.  It takes years before kids need less of your attention.  \n\nNo one's a bad guy, but sometimes the friendship just runs its course.  That might be happening here.

You're not taking her off of the list you're just adding a lot of other things onto it, and she needs to know that those things are important too and most of them can't just be bumped back or off entirely to appease her.

I have been that friend (Best friends since 15, in each other's weddings. She visited me at the hospital when I had my first baby, etc.) . She didn't have time for simple coffee in the 5+ years of graduate school. I was having a very hard time and simply wanted SOME time ANYTHING. A freaking BONE.. All I wanted was coffee and, it's true, you make time for things that matter and you didn't state how much time she was asking for - 20 minutes for coffee once in a blue moon? You know what happened to my friendship of 20 years? We haven't talked in over 2 years. That is how she has shown me how much that friendship is. So, if you're willing to put your \"best friend over half of your life\" last, after feeding your independent cat (of all things) and can't commit to a small lunch here and there.. then yeah, YTA.\n\nETA: I realize that people may not agree, but look at the other persons perspective. Things and life change, sure. But what her friend said is true, you do make time for things that matter and there are a slew of things that are now prioritzed over her friend (which is fine) but it doesn't sound like her friend was asking for much - just something and being told they no longer matter stings, and hurts - much like a breakup. These relationships, after years, become family. To wake up one day and that person no longer cares to put in any effort.. It really hurts. If the roles were different and this was a romantic relationship, you would all say OP was the AH. But platonic friendships are equally important in life, and the seperation can be just as devastating.\n\nETA2: Thanks to WatercressSmall8570, I was informed that the friend was requiring multiple hour commitment every week and I can understand, all things considered, how that would be too much. I think it's more of an ESH situation. I think the friend likely is struggling with the natural progression of a changing life and roles and not knowing/understanding their place in OP's life anymore, when it was consistant for so many years. I think having a mature conversation about it and explaining to them that they still matter, but there are other things that need to be made a priority in the meantime and being unable to commit to multiple hour gettogethers every week isn't an indicator of their friendship ceasing. I think planning for a lunch or short together at a specific time would have probably been easier for both of them. For example, \"Let's meet up for lunch for (2 weeks from now) and we can further talk about it.\" And if the friend continues to ignore OP's feelings then I do feel for OP. WIth that being said, the reason why ESH in this situation is due to how she worded it to her long time friend. There could have been an easier way.", "NTA. \n\nBut a very minor yta for the friend. It sucks finding out you are not a priority and it sounds like you aren't trying to do that.

No, but it's more important than a girl's trip and frequent visits. All my loved ones made time for me because they understood that what this meant to me.

You could offer to help some before your program start. But only if it feels right to do so. \n\nYou will likely need to put genuine effort into nurturing your friendship with her with your discretionary time.  You can point out that the time you do find to spend with her will be special because you won't be able to just casually spend time.\n\n(depending on how much effort you want to put injury maintaining the relationship)\n\nCongrats on your program!", "People are funny about this sometimes.  I\u2019ve also had friends upset that I wouldn\u2019t put them ahead of job responsibilities or my cats.  But they wanted something low priority (like catching a musical).  To me it should be easy to understand that some things are a priority *right now*, given the specifics of the situation.  Like the friendship is an overall life priority, but doing something nonessential that the friend wants is not a priority in this moment.", "If they stay friends, I think the blunt way was better. Once grad school starts, if OP has to say no to something because I have an exam the next day, her friend will know that\u2019s an absolute, and not wheedle and whine to change OP\u2019s mind. \n\nTo be fair, I am really blunt, so I might be biased.", "Self care??? OP is simply taking care of their *responsibilities*. They're not sitting around, getting a massage and telling their friend they're not important, lol! Jeebus.", "Lol. I'd rather not have friends who refuse to do their own emotional labour. My friends insecurities are not my job to fix. If you want to waste your time doing that be my guest.", "Except OP didn't say she wasn't important enough. She said she wasn't *more* important than OP's education & health. No friend would or should be. and if you can't accept that, you're not a friend, you're a user.", "I just completed my MBA. I missed things with family and friends due to having study group meetings, office hours calls, papers and online exams due on Saturday and Sundays, networking events, class social events. At the graduate level, it's not just going to class and doing homework.  OP honestly CAN'T commit to even local shows and birthday dinners because they may have school related commitments that they can't miss.  And they won't know that until they meet their professors and find out how they structure their classes and what counts towards grades and what doesn't.  \n\nMy sister had a medical emergency on one of my class days.  I reached out to the program admin and let them know that I would miss one of my classes to take care of her and they officially excused me from that session.  The professor factored in that absence when he determined my final grade.  He mentioned it in his comments and quoted his syllabus which stated: missing a class would result in a letter grade deduction.\n\nIn the end, I graduated and while I was a little bummed about the hit to my GPA, it's no biggie because no one is really asking about my GPA anyway.  But this is what the OP will be dealing with in grad school.", "OP needs to know her workload. If the local show or birthday party is a dew days before a paper or project is due, or before a test, she isn't going to be available", "Yes, OP\u2019s friend is being kind of selfish and ungracious. I think when the friend made that passive aggressive remark about how \u201cwe make time for what\u2019s important\u201d, my response would be \u201cAnd what I\u2019m saying is, I will soon have *a lot* on my plate, and in such circumstances \u2018we\u2019 should be understanding and supportive of a friend instead of pressuring them to add more commitments to an already challenging schedule. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\nIf the friend wants reassurance that their friendship is important to OP, why not just ask for that? As in \u201cI know you\u2019ll be busy once school starts, but I really value our friendship, so I hope we can find time to at least have lunch or whatever occasionally. Keep me posted about what your schedule looks like, and I\u2019m sure we can figure it out, okay?\u201d", "No one is saying your friends should be more important than your education, but people with busy lives are also able to maintain relationships. \nOP told her friend she wasn't important enough for her to try and make time for her, and that obviously hurt her, she could have said the same with other words.", "Yes that\u2019s what it seems like. I think Reddit gets so in a twist because they preach \u201cyou don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d. But if we heard the friends side of the story Im sure they\u2019d be calling OP the asshole!", "Right but she doesn't know how demanding her grad program will be just yet. Waiting to see what the workload will actually be like before she considers other commitments is the responsible thing to do especially since this would be a weekly commitment and not a one time event.", "My guess is that OP is underestimating the way grad school takes over your whole life. It depends on the program, but unless you've done it or shared your life with someone who did, you have way to grasp how big a deal it tends to be.\n\nIt's better to be honest now than to drop the ball later on after you've committed to something. I definitely think NTA.", "I\u2019ve spent many, many years in higher ed, including now teaching.  I frequently won\u2019t make plans until I have an upcoming semester set - and I\u2019m the one who gets to do the planning!  I want to see how the semester structure is going to flow before scheduling something only to have to back out.  It\u2019s harder as a student - you don\u2019t know all of this until you have all your syllabi and calendar things out.  And grad school is much less forgiving of absences and late work than undergrad - especially when the program is night classes because missing one is a full week\u2019s with of material.\n\nI would absolutely not schedule hanging out months in advance.  Plus, in this case it sounds like an ongoing volunteer obligation that OP doesn\u2019t really want to do anyway - and no way I\u2019d use my minimal leisure time on something I don\u2019t value.", "When you ask your friend a question but don\u2019t want to hear \u201cno\u201d then did you really ask a question?", "No, that's NOT what she said. That's you putting your own spin on it. What she said was that she couldn't make plans *far in advance* because of her other commitments that were more important than leisure time with a friend. And she tried to do it politely & tactfully first. But the so-called friend then attempted to guilt-trip her. \n\nFriend is TA. OP is NTA.", "You're so right about this. People just say \"uh technically i can do this, uh technically i can ignore people, uh technically i can tell my friends something thatd make them feel less valued.\" Well technically then your actions have consequences even with social interactions! You dont get to be rude and question the hang up.", "Yes. I can go weeks between texts w my bff. Both of us work FT. Both are in school. When her BIL died last year, I quickly volunteered to watch her kid so she could do services w the family and not have to worry about kid being there. Same when some family drama went down with my family. Part of it is that as we get older, we are more comfortable with our friendship so we know where we stand with each other and that we will support each other during a crisis.", "Who said that I did not behave like a friend? Just because I valued quality time over the quanity does not reduce the friendship. But there were times I had deadlines and could not afford to hang out for an entire afternoon and they were not ok w the other plans suggested (putting off a week or a quick lunch/dinner). On multiple occasions, I dropped everything because that was what was needed (friend had stillbirth, family members were placed in hospice, people died, friends gave birth). There are ways to be a friend and still have the boundaries you need to have to balance work/school/family/home.", "Damn, my FBI status was revealed. /s", "Omg *that line*! It is such a loaded one and such a guilt trip! It sounds like something a passive aggressive mom guilting you into some family event Says.\n\nSorry but the moment she said that I lost a lot of empathy for the friend. there are times in real life when you have to prioritize. Op said she has work and school and many other aspects of her life she\u2019s gonna have to focus on and she\u2019s doesn\u2019t want to take on any other commitments on top of that.\n\nOp sounds intelligent and practical. Friend just seems needy and childish. Most adults understand that sometimes you have other priorities above some social obligations. \n\nIt sounds like friend is afraid op is going to move on to bigger and better things and leave her in the dust. You know the quickest way to all but ensure that? Make yourself a hurdle to their life goals.\n\nLook I get that the friend is worried they\u2019re gonna be left behind or they\u2019re not gonna be a priority for their friend but the fact of the matter is a big part of being a good friend is supporting your friends in their goals in life.\n\nThis friend is being totally unsupportive. Their friend is getting ready to start something she\u2019s been working for most of her life and all the friend seems to care about is how that affects her.\n\nif she was a real friend she\u2019d be finding ways to help op through the journey she\u2019s embarking on and helping find ways to lighten her load, not making herself yet another time sucking obligation for op to contend with.\n\nRight now work and school has to be ops too priority. If friend doesn\u2019t understand that then maybe they\u2019re not such a great friend.", "Thanks! That wasn\u2019t clear initially, especially from the automod response.", "Yes, the update makes it clear that the commitment that the friend wants is a big problem. It\u2019s far beyond the impression I originally got, especially from the automod reply. I was thinking it was more like a social interaction with just them, where it could be arranged or rearranged week-to-week. And for things like that, getting something on the schedule at all can help it happen sometime. But wanting a commitment of several hours a week, every week for months, for something that is the friend\u2019s interest not OP\u2019s, is not at all reasonable.", "I was asked to be a bridesmaid when I was in grad school but told my friend I could if her wedding was in X time frame. I couldn't manage at other times because of my school commitments.", "Ditto!", "I didn't see the edit saying it's a few hours every week. That still doesn't strike me as untenable, but I don't know OP's life. That said, there is definitely a happy medium that could be struck, like saying 'I can't commit in advance but will make at least one event a month' for example.", "Pittsburgh.

But I don't think it's common for that to be an option.", "I'm in the US and my PC doctor has one day a week where she see's patients as late as 7pm.\n\nHowever, she doesn't see patients AT ALL on Fridays.

Let's look at the calendar once I have a better idea about my obligations.\"\n\nOP literally said that.", "as someone currently in graduate school i 100% dont have hours of time to invest into relationships during the semester. i tried to do that when i first started graduate school and turned in everything late until i accepted i didnt have time.", "You're not going to make it through 5 years to defend your PhD if you have no time for friendships or relationships would be my advice. Or you are just built different and immune to burnout. There is no way you are working more hours than my friends that were residents on-call for 90 hours a week, yet they still found time to hang out when they could (those in our friend group that were not doctors did our best to accommodate them since we knew how important that time was to them). Or my friend that works for one of the big three consultant firms, grinding 14 hour days, who still finds time to hop online and play some video games or watch a movie once a week (they initiate this). Yes, it's all anecdotes, but from also my own personal experience I am warning you, all work and no play will wear you down.", "We talk every couple of days, often for hours at a time.

Yes. Does it sound a little insane?  Also yes.", "When someone is making you feel bad it\u2019s OK to speak up, even necessary. You don\u2019t have to be \u201csupportive\u201d of a friends choice to make you feel unimportant. \n\nMy assumptions about grad students in demanding programs still having time for friends is based on a lot experience. They even meet their future spouses quite often in the midst of it all. There\u2019s time to both create and maintain relationships.

Absolutely.", "Given that the friend is being pushy to try to get the commitment from OP, I don\u2019t think it would have been understood if OP later bowed out.", "Almost sounds like the \"friend\" was pushing to be told she was most important.", "I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t owe any time. Of course with no input it\u2019s not a friendship!\n\nI\u2019m saying expecting a minimum time or pushing like this friend did and not being understanding when someone\u2019s life changes is not good friendship. \n\nLike you I don\u2019t think OP was ignoring the friend. I think they are uncertain anout the coming months and want to manage expectations. And the friend didn\u2019t respect that at all.", "Yeah bro, there is a self-care aspect to \u2018I don\u2019t value this friendship enough to put any priority on it above a litany of other things so please stop asking.\u2019\n\nLike, fuck - one of the things listed was taking care of the house. Can\u2019t put off cleaning for a few hours to hang out with a friend?  You don\u2019t give a fuck about that friend. And it is self-care to let your friend know not to bother you with petty shit like trying to be a friend.", "No shit. You can do it tactfully though. Whatever it was, it was important to the friend. This person gave them a list of reasons why it was unimportant from their point of view. It may be true, but if you did it in a way that the person is no longer speaking to you maybe you dun goofed.", "Self care does not include cleaning your house LOL! Wild. OPs friend was already being a condescending AH by shitting on her education. So...bummer, I guess, for the friend. They should have been a better friend.", "Yeah, this. I agree. Based on OP's post, I'm getting the vibe especially in the first-middle parts that the friend is a bit self-absorbed too. OP didn't explicitly say \"I won't be there at all.\" It's just that she can't set a date months ahead and that she can't commit to doing stuff for a long time because she has her own thing going on. They could have ended there and just settled on a different meetup date that only rarely happens so it wouldn't be too demanding.\n\nYet the friend resorted to guilt tripping her with her statement, which sounds more like OP should prioritize the friend's project over her own education.", "Bummer indeed. This person also shat on the friend for having different priorities. Time for the friendship to end. They were both assholes and not assholes. Everyone sucks.", ">they will be there for their friend in an emergency but not to hang out.\n\nThis is the opposite of AH behavior. Telling your friend that you have a ton of responsibilities and thus can't commit to leisure hangouts, _but if they need you you'll drop everything to help them_ is 100% good friend material. Like wtf", "I wrote my comment above before the edit as well. But generally it\u2019s kinda ableist to say what people \u201cshould\u201d be able to handle when you don\u2019t know their health, lives or what the friend was asking of them. (Not calling you ableist, just saying that sweeping generalizations can certainly come across that way, since you\u2019re unaware of specific barriers).\n\nOP\u2019s situation is relatable for me. When I was in grad school, working full time, juggling medical appointments for multiple chronic illnesses, being a present spouse, and taking care of my pets, I could not consistently commit to anything else on a weekly basis. Some weeks I might have time and energy, but other weeks I would not. It just depended. OP doesn\u2019t know what kind of balance they will be able to find, so it\u2019s best to not build up their friend\u2019s expectations and then flake, or overwork themselves by trying to keep extra commitments. I definitely did that as well in grad school, participating in/volunteering for too many things and getting burned out."]}
