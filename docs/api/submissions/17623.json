You can tell her you want to spend time with her, but *temporarily,* you have to focus on this program. You will graduate!

You wouldn't go hang with a friend instead of going to work, right?? Your education will get you hopefully a job that pays your bills. It's necessary. You've got a busy personal life, you can still have a social life, but not at the expense of your education commitments which are non negotiable. at the end of the day, she's not paying your bills, and she was trying to guilt you by saying you make time for things that are important, and you replied directly to what she said, to the point she raised. Her making out that she's important, you pointing out yes she is, but what is more important/comes first is not being an AH, it's just the truth. Especially not wanting to make commitments when you're unsure of what your load is going to be before then. Anyway, anyone who would rather you jeopardise your job or education over catching up, isn't much of a friend", "Your friend was just acting like a normal person, looking to make plans with a friend, but got shut down pretty hard. I suspect you were feeling a bit stressed about this new chapter and were seeking to manage expectations. Well. Now you won\u2019t have to worry about hanging out with her. Instead you\u2019ll make new friends in grad school to procrastinate with, but you\u2019ll feel better about it since they\u2019re in the same program. The fact is that even in the most demanding of programs everyone will still make time for what they really care about - people always do. \n\nYour delivery was not great, so YTA for that.", "Agreed. OP is not technically wrong but there are tactful ways of saying this without making a good friend feel like sh*t. You don't literally say \"you're not important right now\". NAH indeed.", "Nah, fuck that. OP clearly stated the much more tactful \"I'm not comfortable making plans that extend to when Grad School starts.\" and was met with their friend saying \"We make time for the things that are important to us.\" They had to be blunter.", ">telling your friend that she\u2019s less important,\n\nHe didn't. \nHe said 'not more important than'.", "Assuming OP is reporting accurately, they didn't say the friend was not important, only that they have responsibilities that are more important.", "So the next reply is \u201cYeah and I\u2019m not gonna make time for you\u201d ? Because that\u2019s pretty much what OP said. They listed all the stuff that comes ahead of their friend when she could\u2019ve said \u201cI\u2019ll try my best, but I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d", "NTA, you have your own life and responsibilities, also it's your future in game here, If she's a good friend she's going understand that it's an important thing for you and support you\n\nI don't think you was rude by being honest, but maybe talk with her and ask why she did get angry at you, explain your pov as well and that she need understand that while your friendship is important, you and her need know the boundaries, because a friendship is based in respect just like any other relationship\n\nShe need understand that sometimes you'll prioritize other things that not your time with her", "NTA.\n\nI do think you are being reasonable about trying to ensure you can honor commitments you have and not wanting to over extend yourself. Grad school can be really demanding and it is wise to at least give yourself some time to adjust before committing to other things.\n\nBut, consider, depending on how close this friend is to you and how important their relationship is, that if they are feeling insecure about losing you, that perhaps some reassurance from you that they are still important to you would be a nice thing to offer.\n\nLook, their mental health isn\u2019t on you BUT they are a friend so just a thought.\n\nYes we make time for the things that are important. However, our resources and time are finite. Meaning sometimes we have more things we care about in our lives than we can manage at the same time and so\u2026 we make trade offs. We do what we can for what is important at the time it is important and then, hopefully, we make room to enjoy and honor those things we didn\u2019t have time for eventually.", "NTA. You were upfront about your concerns with your upcoming schedule and workload. Her saying that you make time for what's important was really not a nice or direct way of saying that OP's education and other life stuff are not. I have friends I don't see in six months. It's chill.", "NTA. \n\n>>\u2026we make time for what is important. \n\nAre we talking scheduling a dinner date, an all day trip back to the home town to visit the friend, an entire weekend away with friend? \n\nI think OP is taking the responsible approach to their program. They need to know the syllabus schedule of the grad program classes for the semester before committing to anything.  Committing and cancelling later is worse than not committing at all.  \n\nIf OP and friend are both local, then getting together will be much easier. Everyone has to eat. Grab a meal together. It doesn\u2019t have to be an all evening event. Let it be just dinner and a quick chat. If it\u2019s done often enough, it feels like normal catching up. Meeting up for lunch near campus works or grab some takeout and have a lunch picnic. It doesn\u2019t have to be drawn out to interfere with OP\u2019s schedule. \n\nOP probably needed to take a softer approach to the phrasing. The content was accurate, though.", "NTA.... you have yourself together... working school health your pet is more important", "You are NTA. I've been placed in this same situation and honestly you are 100% valid for creating boundaries that you are comfortable with especially since you have no idea what to expect initially. Your friend is in the wrong for trying to pin you right of the bat of a major and difficult life event.", "You acknowledged to her that you were going to be busy and she does not have the same respect for your priorities. \nI\u2019m graduating with my Masters right now, I completely understand. I always tried to make time for the people important to me but my family was always more important than my friends and other relationships, which caused some relationships to suffer in this time. Other people understood. Some just truly did not grasp how busy I was, even with trying my best. It was never ever enough. For some people, your best will never be enough. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, leaning towards NAH. I can understand that she is frustrated as well.\n\nI am in your situation kinda. Very busy with school and unexpected extra days, or people messaging me on my free days, plus health problems (extremely tired for no known reason). It sucks, but you can't make time if you don't have it, or do activities if you don't have the energy to do it. Education is extremely important, and your social life can hit an all-time low because of that. But this is a temporary situation that is extremely important for you future", "NTA. However I don't agree with \"we make time for what is important\" even the slightest. This comes from a privileged point of view. Your 24 hours and her 24 hours are different, because you both have different things to do and have differently abled body. If she can't accept it, that's on her. Not on you.", "#NTA\n\nThere will situations in your friend's existence where you can't be prioritized, so why does she take offense to the notion that she won't be prioritized all the time?", "NTA \n\nAs adults we have priorities. Which often, do have to come before friendships. You need a new friend.", "NTA. Your wording isn't great, but the message you were trying to send is true. Right now you have other responsibilities that are limiting your free time, and as a result it is hard to commit to spending time with her. You don't suddenly hate her,  and a good friend would understand that having less free time for friends is simply a part of a lot of people's adult lives, particularly if they know about your health issues. If you want to make amends you could still apologise for what you said, or at least how you said it, but I think it is possibly your friend is upset not just because of this conversation. Logically they might understand why you aren't always available to hang out, but it is possible she was already upset about something else when you told her you weren't free. Either way I'd say give her a while to hopefully cool down and then talk with her about it.", "NTA", "NTA. You want to keep the first little while you're in school open so you can adjust to it and see what your time commitments are. She should respect that.", "Interesting. Personally I have never had a friendship where, if my friend said something like this, I would have been offended. I have some really good friends that I care about, but I don't expect to be as important to them as their health or education or career or their adult responsibilities - so I think you're NTA.", "NTA. You were clear with her. Her inability to accept this is her own fault", "INFO - was there some event that your friend wanted you to commit to?", "NTA. Stupid people require stupid responses.", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. It sounds like your friend is not supporting your choice to go to grad school and is using your friendship to guilt trip you. \nI don\u2019t know what some people read, but I didn\u2019t see your response to her as anything but honest. You are expressing anxiety about how your life is about to change and trying to prepare for it. I don\u2019t have a friend who would choose to question my choice of education and career path. Aren\u2019t our loved ones supposed to be cheering for us? \nIt sounds like she is worried that you will move on with new friends and a the kind of career that she has no access to. Whether it\u2019s jealousy or fear of abandonment, something is going on with her, and that is what you both need to address. Maybe she needs a little reassurance that once you feel comfortable with the new schedule, you can find little opportunities to hang out and start to plan things.  Wouldn\u2019t it be great if she learned to be supportive and not focused on the negative things that may or may not happen?\nHang in there, OP. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in both friend\u2019s position and OPs position. Friend has blatantly stated she doesn\u2019t care about OPs path in the past. I think OP either needs to re-evaluate the friendship or work on more creative ways to stay in contact, but the older we get the less time we have for friends unless there are special circumstances and that\u2019s a natural way of growing up. We do make time for what\u2019s important, and sometimes even our best friends have to take second or third place. Seen it with besties growing up and having kids, seen it with besties having mental health crisis, but we\u2019re all still besties at the end of the day because we understand there are only so many hours in the day.", "NTA.\n\nTo all the people here saying NAH and lecturing OP about grace... come on, they are setting boundaries and have to repeatedly defend themselves from their friends pushiness and basically insults in regards to OPs life choices.", "Nta. You were a bit blunt. Perhaps you can apologize for how you said it, but not what you said. \nI hope you can remain friends, but this might mean the friendship has ran its course.", "NTA. Grad school is time consuming and expensive. Grad school can land you better jobs. I assume your friend isn\u2019t willing to pay your way in life if you fail grad school. It\u2019s called being a responsible adult and sometimes that means making sacrifices.", "I'm guessing you just finished college... Your friend sounds like someone who hasn't lived adult life because everything you said is 100% true. \n\nI understand your friend wants to spend time with you but tbh your friend is being selfish by not realizing you clearly are under some stress and only worrying about how you're going to make time for her when she should be supportive of you pursuing your dreams. \n\nIf she's a real one she'll realize this at some point. NTA", ">In addition, I have a pet who will need caring for and I have chronic health issues that require doctor appointments.\n\nAnd here's where you cross over from reasonable to clearly just coming up with excuses. Just be honest and tell this woman you don't value her friendship because you're too prestigious, or whatever.", "Well you just told your friend that she is unimportant. However your friend should not have pressed you in the first place. So I guess NTA? Maybe work on your delivery.", "NTA Your future can be dramatically improved by your plan being a success. It's a shame she doesn't see it that way, and therefore it's understandable that she's annoyed you might have less time to spend with her. It's a bit silly, as she ought to be supportive, but that's a small thing really. It probably stings to be told that she's less important than your plan in actual words, as it's already obvious. I think beint so blunt about it is your only mistake, and it's a social faux pas rather than anything serious. Most of the bad behaviour seems to be on her part, some people are a bit self-centred and others can be a bit sceptical of higher education for all sorts of reasons, but ultimately she should be supportive of your desire to do this course. Once she realises you've not ditched her, she'll come around even if she won't necessarily support you. That is, if you actually want  to keep her as a friend.", "You're NTA, but there are also ways to better communicate. I agree that your personal life, education and responsibilities should always take priority. However, maybe expressing those levels of importance to your friend, when she's reaching out because she cares about you and wants to spend time with you might sound hurtful. \n\nMaybe you should talk to her and express your concerns at a time when you are both open to hear each other out.", "NTA. I can only wish I was able to put down firm boundaries like you. I'm a doormat and I got stepped all over when I was trying to make time for my school. You seem to have no problem thinking of yourself first and making others respect you so that's really useful for you.", "Nta. You didn't say anything wrong. She's the one who has the issue with the fact that you have responsibilities. Not your fault \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA, this is delusional", "NTA, though you could have been more tactful. Regardless, you\u2019re going to want and need a good support system when you\u2019re in grad school. Prepping for grad school should include strengthening bonds with your friends and family, not burning bridges.", "Sometimes it\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it.", "INFO: what was the context in which you declined plans? Was friend inviting you on a week-long vacation? Was she trying to make a plan for a dinner in June?\n\nI feel like, if the latter, you just might be the asshole, guilty of a thing I like to call \"time hoarding,\" which is when people are nebulously anxious about something impending and cope by arbitrarily walling themselves off and building a fortress around their calendar. \n\nIt sounds like you operated from an assumption that she would poo poo your new grad school because of things she said in the past and were preemptively defensive beyond what the situation called for, and as such, you hurt her feelings. Your friend was asking to see you and connect with you. You basically told her she's like, 23rd on your list, and tough nuggies, when you could have said, \"Yes, lets definitely get together in June! I need to see how my school stuff shakes out because I'm feeling pretty anxious about juggling it all. Can we check in once about this once school starts?\"", "You are technically right about your schooling being important but now she knows where she ranks in your list of priorities - which is very low.\n\nAlso, ngl, this sounds a bit like a cop-out. You could've just said \"hey, let me give you a tentative 'yes' but please be aware I'm going to have to settle into my program first and if it gets to hectic, I might have to cancel\".\n\nYou could've shown her you still want to hang out, you appreciate her and her time. But the way ou handled it, it may just have cost you a friendship.\n\nBTW, this has nothing to do with her \"valuind education less\". She just wants to spend time with a friend and as you are clearly important to her, she thought she was just as important to you. She was proven wrong.\n\nYTA.", "NAH. Some people can handle the truth, some can\u2019t. That said, just acknowledging what she said, without committing to anything, would have been the tactful way to go.", "NTA\n\nYou're putting yourself first and you weren't rude about it. Her comment about \"we make time for what is important\" was kind of inconsiderate. Yes friendships are important, and we have to respect our friends if we want to keep them... but they're not a priority, EVER. If you gotta drop plans in order to better yourself then do it. If they're real friends they will understand where you're coming from, if not... well, you're better off without them. This doesn't mean you love your friends any less or are mean to them or are being malignantly selfish, either; life just changes and sometimes goals don't align anymore and plans are put on hold. I'm sure that if it was the other way around she would do the same as you and not bat and eyelash.\n\nPutting yourself first and foremost is one of the healthiest things you can do, specially if you're chronically ill. Abled and healthy people don't get it till they have to fight off an illness or disease.", "NTA but it sounds like there maybe was a better way you could have handled things. Straight honesty doesn't always go down well.\n\nPerhaps you can make plans that are closer to home and don't require days of absence?\n\nWhat you may also find happening is a sway towards the extreme of work, studying, responsibilities etc, then a shift back towards balance. But it's very much about finding that balance. That being said, work I feel is definitely easier to manage than the pressures of studying. \n\nI guess, last of all: as someone who struggles to have relationships, don't take the relationships you have for granted. Maybe you make friends easier than I but at the very least it's important to see, and respect the friends you have.", "NTA. Your friend is jealous.", "YTA\n\nIt's completely fine and fair to prioritize education and health before other things, there were however many ways to say that that didn't involve telling your friend they are not as important.

These things are unwritten rules. You should have said something like 'When I start my new course I'll need to take some time to focus on settling in before I can work out my new routine, but as soon as I know what's going on let's make plans!'. Instead you basically told her to know her place. You don't say that to friends!", "Uh. Are you dating her or engaged? Are you friendzoned? Why does she think she has such control of this?\n\nMaybe you could have been more tactful, but NTA", "This is probably one of those it's not what you say it's how you say it things.

She\u2019d been complaining about not getting exercise and eating well etc\u2026 and she\u2019d nearly had a nervous breakdown during her degree. I suggested that maybe on Sundays she came round my house and I would make brunch and we could go for a walk (thinking it would clear off some of her struggles as I could also give her a few reheat meals on Sunday for the week). She (through stress) went on on me about how I was trying to put myself above her responsibilities and her Uni course etc\u2026 was more important. \nI also stepped away so that we didn\u2019t argue and when I was calm I just explained I was concerned about her and had offered to help.

Education is important. But friends and family can\u2019t ever be replaced. I can say with confidence that there are very few lifelong friends in my life, but those friends have seen me through the best, and worst parts of my life. My education, my job, all the money in the world. None of those would have saved me from almost taking my life. My friends did that, in the worst of the pandemic, they stepped up, they were there. The degree on the wall, it didn\u2019t do shit! Life May look long to you now, and the future full of possibility, and that\u2019s all true. The future is in your hands. But all that education, and the six figure job still doesn\u2019t make people happy. Friends and family, at the pub on a rainy Wednesday night in the middle of a shitty week when nothing seems to be going right. The Friends that make you laugh, or cry with you, or show up with pizza when you\u2019re on your 36 of your shift at the hospital and the food sucks there. Yeah they matter.

It\u2019s important to be careful with your time, but what you\u2019re telling her is that you don\u2019t see her friendship and company as part of your work-life balance.

So many ways to answer this other than \"uhm other stuff in my life is more important\" yeah sure the friend is aware that your health comes first but doesn't need to hear it.

I\u2019m getting vibes that the real issue here might be that friend has grown weary of OP constantly talking about her grad program, perhaps a bit braggadociously.

Sounds braggy, and if the OP really is worried about balanc\u00edng her program demands with friend\u2019s quality time expectations, you\u2019d think an adjective like \u201cintensive\u201d would have come more readily to mind. There\u2019s also the friend\u2019s comments about privilege and questioning the ROI of the program, maybe she\u2019s tired of it being rubbed in her face that the OP got into this \u201cprestigious\u201d program, and also she could suspect it\u2019s a degree OP is going for to feed her ego that won\u2019t necessarily translate into more opportunities or money in the job market. There are a lot of expensive vanity masters programs out there now. It\u2019s also very possible the friend threw out a comment like \u201chey, wouldn\u2019t it be fun to spend Labor Day at the beach this year?\u201d and OP used that as an opportunity to say \u201coh, I don\u2019t know, you know that\u2019s right about the time I\u2019ll be starting my masters program, and I\u2019ll just be so busy\u201d for the umpteenth time and it\u2019s grating on friend\u2019s nerves.

I think this is just the case of adults drifting apart. But I will say that if you wanted to keep her in your life you shouldn't have said literally everything else in your life is more important than her.

That way I could do both.\n\nEducation is important. Pets are important to some people.

Some of it is that when people know they are ill or pregnant or TTC, they step back a bit on friendships like getting cheaper insurance when broke. Then the big thing happens you and realise why sometimes small investments are worth their weight in gold.\n\nChronic illness will isolate you anyway. In my experience unless the person is actively problematic, do not burn friendship bridges when you are chronically ill. Buy them a small gift like a card and say \u2018sorry I can\u2019t make plans right now but I miss you and looking forward to thing when my calendar is clear.\u2019 I had a friend write a bunch of cards like this when her brother was dying and she was absent for all the big friendship things. She meant it too. It was as much her goal as a calculation.\n\nAnd you know what? She was incredibly supported when he passed and then when shortly after she had a baby.

Straight up saying you're not as important to me as this other stuff in my life, is a tactless and heartless way to say this. Sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it.

And if you\u2019re going to reconsider a friendship because someone told you the truth about the priorities after you pushed them into that corner, then like your friends mayyy be better off. \n\nShe didn\u2019t tell her friend she wasn\u2019t important. It was like \u201cyea you\u2019re important but currently this is what requires the most attention in my life\u201d. Her friend was trying to guilt her into compliance or feel guilty about not matching to her friend\u2019s tune.", "Allow me to butt in, please.\n\nReading OP's post, I see two points that I haven't seen other people address yet:\n\n>I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with *making plans that extend into the time when grad school has started*, as I wasn\u2019t sure about how much time I would have\n\n\"Plans that extend into the time when grad school has started\" - what I get from this is that OP's friend wanted to plan for something that wasn't just a concert, a museum visit or a birthday dinner. Whatever it was, it appears that the plans required more time, and extend into school starting time. A two-week vacation? A pottery class? A plan to prepare for the New Year's Marathon?\n\nThen\n\n>Her response was that *we make time for what is important*, which I agree with in theory. However, I will be working, going to school, and maintaining my home. In addition, I have a pet who will need caring for and I have chronic health issues that require doctor appointments.\n\nI would feel flat out insulted with the friend's reply. If she is indeed a friend, she knows about the health issues and that OP has a pet that needs caring for. But the friend considers *these are not important*. I would take offense if a supposed friend said that *whatever plans she has* were important and my doctor's appointments weren't.\n\nStill, I agree that one wrong word can convey a really different meaning to something we are trying to express.\n\nI would not say that my issues are more important than *the friend*. But I would certainly tell the friend that my life priorities take precedence over whatever *leisure plans* she has, and therefore I was unable to commit to anything so far ahead.\n\nETA: NAH", "I agree with your completely and I think you explained what I said in a less emotional way than I did.", ">like, that shit doesn't announce flare ups nor crisis\n\nStill amazed at how many people completely overlook this fact, telling OP they should have \"bEeN nIcEr\". OP was nice. Friend wasn't hearing the nice message.\n\n>she's gonna throw a hissy fit at this\n\nDING, DING, DING!!! We have a winner.\n\nYou get the feeling that in the future this will be the same friend that can never do anything cuz money's tight, and ends up never actually retiring, just working til she can't?", ">Of course not, but I'm also able to say something like \"I don't know what my schedule is going to look like when school gets into full swing, so I'm not able to commit to scheduling something that far out.  Let's look at the calendar once I have a better idea about my obligations.\"\n\nAh, see? So you understand that some people are less important that other responsibilities in a priority scale.\n\nAlso, OP said that at first, friend pushed, OP went the blunt route. Even you admit friend tried to guilt trip her. So OP shouldn't have been firmer after that?", "Or worse, expecting others to drop everything to help her financially/morally. \n\nMy ex had a friend like OP and my ex and their group was OP's friend. I witnessed this same thing happen except the chronically ill part, the friend was pushed and shoved to the edge and had to resort to be exceptionally blunt and kick everyone except me and another guy out of his house to be able to work in peace. So I understand OP completely. \n\nA lot of people don't seem to understand priorities and boundaries... treating friendships like corporate treats employees.", "There's firmer, and then there's how OP responded.  That's my whole point."]}
