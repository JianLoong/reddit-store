This guy doesn't deserve you, and you deserve someone who is proud to show you off. Instead here's a guy gaslighting you for not showing up to an event he invited you to but didn't give you the time and location. \n\nSeriously, you deserve so much better than this. 4.5 years together and you haven't met his family? I would run!", "Honestly you are the asshole for still being in this relationship. You are disrespecting yourself so it\u2019s no surprise your bf is disrespectful as well.", "NTA. You should have dropped him like...yesterday! Why stay with someone who has repeatedly shown you his red flags for 4.5 years?!?! Don't do this to yourself. Believe me, there are plenty of people in this who would never do this to you. \n\nHe doesn't show you off because he doesn't want you. He's just not that into you.", "NTA. If this has been going on for 4.5 years, you should have enough experience now to know that he - for whatever reason - doesn't want your relationship public. That's a really long time to continue this. \n\nYou might try couples counseling and see if he can finally work it out and decide to prioritize your relationship, or maybe you'll understand why you need to leave.", "NTA, except maybe to yourself", "NTA. He\u2019s gaslighting you. You need to run and fast. I\u2019m sure there are other signs he\u2019s no good for you other than what you mentioned. Do yourself a favor and cut your losses now.", "NTA\n\nI'm willing to bet his friends and family have no idea you exist. Stop being his dirty little secret.", "NTA! He's gaslighting you. How on earth could it be your fault when he didn't even give you a time and place? He didn't want you there but rather than being honest is trying to put the blame on you. It's really crappy bf behaviour.", "NTA you deserve a partner that will be proud to bring you places and present you to everyone he knows.

I know his family is *an* issue, but it sounds like it\u2019s his hang up as well. You can\u2019t tell me he doesn\u2019t have a single friend who isn\u2019t racist. \n\nAnd it proves it with this work thing- he says \u201cyou can come if you want\u201d but doesn\u2019t give you details?

After nearly 5 years?\n\nI'm sorry but there has to be a reason for that. That is not normal.

But seriously there is a whole lot to be concerned about here.", "NTA\n\nHe certainly is. You might want to have a very serious heart-to-heart to see what his problem is. \n\nThat being said, my spouse of a 21 year relationship took over 10 years to let me to meet friends and family. It wasn\u2019t me - serious compartmentalization that had nothing to do with me. I stuck it out. It\u2019s totally been worth it.
