Mum of four here - you offered a very kind and generous solution to the no kids rule for your wedding which is more than I\u2019d expect if I was invited somewhere child free - in Australia if you\u2019re invited to a kid free wedding usually it\u2019s on you to find alternate care for your kids. The solution is simple - either your cousin sucks it up and enjoys a kid free night or she misses your wedding but in no way does that make you the AH. Your wedding your rules!", "INFO: is your cousin a single mom?", "NTA", "NTA. They should stay home if the options you presented aren't suitable.", "NTA. If your cousin is uncomfortable with the childcare options you are providing, she is free to make other arrangements.", "Honestly what is it with all the child free wedding drama. In my culture the parents are overjoyed to get a day away from the kids. Generally the only children at the wedding are the page boys/flower girls and they are gone by 9pm", "NTA.\n\nNo kids is no kids, no exception.  If she's that concerned then she can not come to the wedding.  End of story.", ">gracious enough to arrange a babysitting\n\nThat part alone is pretty amazing. Not everyone would offer that.", "This\u2026", "NTA. Be prepared in case she just shows up with her child.", "NTA. Your big day, your rules. A 3 year old is going to be bored as.  Childfree weddings are a legit thing. \n\nStick to your guns and have someone trusted to ensure she doesn't try to attend", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence, and it's only 2 letters long.", "NTA and I\u2019m so tired if the entitled wedding guests  w children", "NTA. \n\nYou're entitled to a childfree wedding if you choose.  You've made that restriction clear. You've also given parents options for childcare. Your cousin can take you up on the care provided, arrange her own, or stay home.", "She doesnt want childcare, she wants her LO to be the star on the wedding\n\nyou even gave her the option to bring a close friend she trusts and she still said no. \n\nNTA dude and happy wedding. ive been with my husband 27 years(same sex couple too)", "With her attitude towards you, I wouldn\u2019t want her at the wedding at all. \n\nI only wanted people who loved and respected me to be there. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's your wedding , your choice. Especially when you're being more than generous offering to pay for child care. Besides if you allow her child and nobody else's then you'll get drama from all of those parents.", "NTA, OP.\n\nI love kids, love seeing kids at weddings, but cousin is being very entitled here.\n\nYou have arranged to provide childcare options. If cousin prefers to have someone she knows watch her child, that is her choice... and she can arrange for that herself. No one is stopping her.\n\nIf what she really means is that she prefers to BE the childcare for her child, then she can stay home and care for her child.\n\nYou've answered her; you don't need to discuss it further. The answer is not changing. Any family members who want to express their support of cousin can offer to spend the wedding/reception time in the child-care area, being the personal childcare for cousin's child. Then her child will be watched by someone that cousin knows.", "NTA and it\u2019s very thoughtful and generous of you to offer and pay for childcare. Sounds like your cousin should stay home if your thoughtful options aren\u2019t good enough", "NTA. Anna can decline the invitation if she doesn't want someone else to watch snookums", "There must be someone from the half of the family who think you're wrong to step forward and volunteer to watch the child...

Your cousin knows that she wants a spotlight on her and her child", "NTA\n\nYou are providing childcare to allow as many people as possible to still attend.

Some people are just so entitled that it makes my teeth itch.", "NTA.     I am a mom.  My kids are very special TO ME.  I understand that they are not as special to everyone else. I would never take my child to a child free wedding or expect anyone to allow just my child at their child free wedding. \n\n\nCongratulations on your wedding. Have a happy marriage.", " NTA. This isn\u2019t her wedding. I find that some of these people who demand, do it because they realise they can make their kid be the only child there and centre of attention. Child care has nothing to do with it.", "NTA. Stick to your rules and wishes. You have provided options for the people with children. Cousin can take it or leave it.", "NTA. Man I hate childfree weddings but it\u2019s your right to have one. My cousin did almost the same thing. He had a childfree wedding and the venue had childcare. I wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving my kids there and the only people I would\u2019ve trusted them with were also attending the wedding as it was out of state. So I just rsvp\u2019d no and didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t ask for an exception. I just chose to stay home with my kids and bought my cousin a gift off his registry. That\u2019s the tactful thing to do.", "Definitely NTA.\nIt's YOUR wedding, YOUR party, YOU and YOUR fiance financing the entire thing (I'm assuming) so YOUR rules go and for those who don't agree with can simply RSVP NO to it. I'm sure nobody is getting held at gunpoint to come to the wedding if they aren't comfortable with any aspect of it. As for family saying YTA please get them to babysit that child with strict instructions that any disturbance caused during the ceremony or any damages would be their responsibility and out of their pocket for ruining your experience of the day with no limits. See how quickly they flip sides then. And I absolutely agree with the child free wedding idea because so many things can go wrong even with no child and the added anxiety is not what you want on your special day. Congratulations to you and Mr.", "NTA - Sorry, but there's not a single toddler on this planet who would enjoy sitting quietly for an hour or watching all their relatives get drunk off their ass.", "NTA. You\u2019re nicer than me, I wouldn\u2019t pay for childcare for someone else\u2019s child.\n\nYour wedding, your rules.", "NTA. First, it's your wedding. You don't want kids there, then no kids.\n\nSecond, not only are you providing childcare, you mention that you are providing a few different options. OPTIONS! This is so above and beyond and amazing of you to try and make it easier on your guests who have kids. \n\nIf she's not comfortable with your options, that's her right. But she doesn't then get to have you change the whole wedding for her.", "NTA I cannot even begin to express in words how you\u2019re 1000% NTA paid for childcare. She\u2019s the AH and so is anybody else that thinks you are. Congratulations on your wedding. \n\nAlso if you think she\u2019s dumb to bring her child anyways you can always hire a wedding asshole to keep out people who bring kids. I\u2019m considering hiring one for mine (if it ever happens) for people with phones lol", "NTA", "NTA. As previously stated, you\u2019d have to just drop the rule and allow all kids to make everyone happy. But honestly, why does a parent want their kid to be the only kid at an adult event? Going to a wedding or reception isn\u2019t fun for kids unless there are other kids to play with. Why do that to your baby??", "NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t want my child watched by a stranger either, so I would provide my own baby sister and have fun at your child free wedding.", "NTA\n\nYour choice. But I have to say, some of my most precious memories as a child are the weddings we went to, where I met relatives we didn\u2019t get to see often.", "NTA you're already going above and beyond in proving free childcare! Most weddings wouldn't have this, parents would have to arrange their own.  Child free weddings are also perfectly normal and reasonable things to have.  Cousin is being wildly entitled.", "NTA It is your wedding. You said NO kids, she doesn't have to go . But rules are rules. Why should her child be the only one that gets to go? Just say NO.", "NTA,", "NTA\n\nYou're the first person I've ever had to organize a care service for the children of people invited to your wedding... My metaphorical hat bows to you.\n\nIf the cousin wants to stay with her kid, she can stay home - and the people suggesting the exception should wonder instead what happens when everybody else asks for the same treatment...\n\nYour cousin is entitled, I would hire security to ensure she doesn't drag her poor child with her.", "NTA, your wedding --> your rules. it is as simple as that. stand your ground.", "NTA, you stated your rules and bending them for one person will just make everyone else angry. Plus, it's your wedding and it's perfectly understandable not to want kids there. You even offered to pay for a babysitter, which is beyond generous. \n\nI'm kind of shocked about how obsessed this young mother is with her kid. She's 3 years old, so kindergarten age. At that age she'll usually be away from her everyday. But somehow, she can't even send her to a babysitter because she can't go a single day without being around her? A child is not your emotional support muppet", "NTA your cousin is acting entltled, it's your wedding and it's childfree. That means no kids, her's included. If she is too selfish to understand that, she should consider her invitation recinded.", "nta", "To those who think you an AH, ask them what to do when everyone else with a child makes the same demand!", "or escort them out when they both turn up - cause that is 100% going to happen", "Bc the cousin is so special that no rules should apply to her or her perfect child. Same attitude everyone who wants to be the exception has.", "The ONLY exception to child free weddings are the kids of the bride & groom. Which by the way should be obvious to everyone.", "Here, we send kids to day care or even Kindergarten at that age. It's totally normal to not have them around 24/7 at that age.", "Yep, and then they will ALL be asking for an exception for their child too. Stick to your guns OP, NO KIDS FOR ANYONE!", "Or kids of bride & groom.", "My brother and SIL are getting married soon and their child (will be 1.5) is going to be at the ceremony and then picked up before the reception! Best of both worlds as LO gets to be apart of the day and mum and dad get to party lol", "entitled lol\ud83d\ude02", "Only if the couple decide it. It is still their wedding.\n\nEdit to correct", "Of course generally they are the page boy/flower girl where I am from", "This is a generalisation. The bride & groom's kids are the only kids that can be a valid exception. And depending on age of said kids they're generally only there for part of wedding"]}
