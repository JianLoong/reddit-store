It\u2019s absolutely fine to say no kids at a wedding. The fact that you are providing child care is amazing and very generous. \n\nMy cousin got married a couple of years ago. It was child-free, partly because it was a waterfront location and they were concerned about safety but mainly because if they had included kids it would have swelled the number of guests beyond what they could afford. It was a destination wedding so it was already expensive for us and a bit of a hassle to attend. Finding people for my kids to stay with was also a hassle, especially since one of my kids is special needs so it\u2019s a big ask, but we worked it out. However, several people complained to my cousin about it. If someone can\u2019t find childcare, they just can\u2019t come. That\u2019s it.", "NTA.

Not to mention your even providing paid for childcare! It\u2019s the entitlement for me! How about she just doesn\u2019t come and that will settle that", "NTA\n\nYou were clear on your invitation it was a child free event. You arranged for, at your own cost and free to the guests, childcare should they not be able to find childcare on their own. If someone is not happy with the childcare they are not entitled to bring their child to an explicitly child free event. They are welcome to decline the invitation, which I'm sure you would understand, or arrange childcare on their own (perhaps a friend or in-law). As a single mother I was invited to several weddings where children were not allowed. I was able to secure childcare on my own for one and the others I had to decline. Your cousin needs to understand no means no (we teach that to our kids after all) and not be the AH in this situation.", "NTA. She has every right to not want to use the childcare you provided (which was a nice gesture!) or to feel excluded or whatever. Her options are to send regrets and not attend or find alternate childcare, because you have every right to throw the kind of wedding you want. \n\nFull disclosure, I don't totally understand childfree weddings or think it's something I would ever want for myself, but I am perfectly willing to accept that other people like them and can throw whatever kind of wedding party they like! I've had to turn down invites in the past because of lack of childcare/breastfeeding and it really wasn't a huge deal. We sent a gift and our love and moved on with our lives. This is the easiest thing in the world to be mature about.", "NTA and I don\u2019t know why other commenters asked for the information on liability. Though it\u2019s good to know, you wouldn\u2019t be TA even with the fruit and fountain as extraneous information. It\u2019s your wedding, and you set the rules. You even did the extra mile with hiring a babysitter! I\u2019m doing a child free wedding in two years and I\u2019m not providing a babysitter. If the cousin can\u2019t find childcare and isn\u2019t comfortable with the arrangements you\u2019ve made, then that\u2019s her choice and a sacrifice people make when having kids. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole and asking for an exception is asshole behavior on your cousin\u2019s part.

She needs to get over it. You could have a child free wedding with zero options for child care. You went above and beyond and it still isnt good enough. If she is that uncomfortable, she needs to not be going.

The amount of times ive been to an event with a buffet and have had to restrain my very young children from snatching food or straight up just shoving fists into food is unbelievable. At ages 6 and 8 they dont do that anymore, but at 2 and 4? Not a chance. They sat with dad/grandma as i made their plates. My daughter had always been drawn to the fruit plates. An entire platter of strawberries and watermelon? Hands so quickly, i could hardly stop her.\n\nYou are providing a safe alternative so people can still enjoy your wedding without concerns of what to do with their kids.

Looking up the definition for modulo though, looks like it can be taken to mean 'these two things are the same after accounting for this difference' so I can see how with that definition at least you might say 'the time we'll arrive will be at 6, once accounting for the presence of rain/modulo rain'. I wouldn't have thought to use it that way, but looks like it's not incorrect.", ":)"]}
