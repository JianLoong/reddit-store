Childhood was rough but it could have been worse. I recently got out of the military and currently live with my mom (42f), stepdad (36m), wife and kid (21f & 8mo), including my two younger brothers (14m & 4m). I know the house sounds packed, but it's really not the house is quite big.\n\nBefore we moved back home in Dec 2022, we decided we will suck it up and move back with our parents until we are ready to buy a house instead of renting (we are very close). My mom has been unemployed for 2-3 years. So I was already planning to contribute monthly. Keep in mind we lost my little brother (16m) August 2022. Here is where the problem is.\n\nFirst, she told me she wanted me to move in so she could help me get me on my feet. She started off saying I don\u2019t have to pay anything monthly. Then its $300/monthly. Okay cool. The minute I told her I got a job back home (I work in tech) and she asked how much. Yep .. I told her, never making that mistake again! As soon as I told her, the prices went up! $600/monthly. Now the number isn\u2019t the issue, it's the way I feel she is trying to take advantage.  I wanted a congrats maybe even feel happy for me. She doesn't pay any bills but I understand that wasn\u2019t my business, but now it is now that im paying. The first 3 months I was paying the 600/month it was no issue. One day me and my stepdad were talking and he told me 600/ month was way too much .. If I just pay the utilities I'll be saving $300 and he was clueless as to why I was sending it to my mom in the first place. From there I wanted to have a sit down, just the 4 of us. My mom and stepdad are on the edge of divorce so the communication isn\u2019t there. Too many secrets. I figured I would tell my mom that I would be handling the bills with my step dad since he\u2019s paying them. I had access to pay the bills directly, something my mom refused to give. My mom flipped out. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t run shit, he isn\u2019t a real man\u201d honestly a whole bunch of emotional bs. I walked out respectfully ignoring her as I went to my car. The next morning she is blowing my phone up with texts about how I need to pack my bags but my wife and kid can stay. \n\nI came home and asked her why she was kicking me out. We got into a yelling match after she said my grandparent brainwashed me. One thing about my mom If she feels like she's losing an argument she will try to cut deep. At the end of the argument she told me she \u201cowned me\u201d everything I did needed to be approved by her. Told me I wasn\u2019t a real man and unfit to provide for a family, a loser. I'm not going to lie, I would have laughed it off .. if it didn't come from my mom.  I asked her after everything I went through, how could you look at me like this? \u201cHow am I a loser if I make more than the average in my state at half of your age? What are you?\u201d I am normally humble because there is always someone with more.

The sooner the better.", "NTA but you need to move out and protect your family from all that drama, especially before the impending divorce starts.", "Hard NTA. It sounds like your mom is dealing with a lot of her own shit currently and taking it out on you. It also sounds like she\u2019s being really shady about where your \u201crent\u201d money is going, if she\u2019s insisting you pay it to her directly rather than in the form of utility bills which you can pay to the company directly. Even more shady is the amount of rent you\u2019re paying not being approved by your step dad and him being surprised you were paying so much. Honestly, I would move out just to not be around your toxic mom if you can afford to.", "Going to go with NTA.  I had Y T A locked and loaded, but put it down.\n\n\"she told me she \u201cowned me\u201d everything I did needed to be approved by her. Told me I wasn\u2019t a real man and unfit to provide for a family, a loser\"\n\nThis is extremely toxic.  You just spent 4/5 years in the army, so you fully know your self worth.\n\nI'd get the apartment, and spend time with your wife and kid.  Go low contact with your mom.  Better to take a few extra years to save for a house than live with that toxicity.  Best of luck.", "NTA\n\nYour mom was mooching off of you by hiking your rent to double the previous amount, especially knowing you're saving for a house, married, with a kid, and having never told your stepdad how much she was charging. Good on stepdad for having your back there.", "Let\u2019s be honest, she asked for that. NTA, good comeback, mom is a control freak.", "NTA- not only did she try and take advantage as soon as she heard how much you made, she needed to hear that after her outburst on how she owned you, could see why her and your step-dad are close to divorce\n\nyour mom needs therapy, this isn't how an adult would normally act, something happened to her with your grandparents, them turning you against her? sounds like past trauma, has she mentioned any past incidents that happened with them?", "NTA sounds to me like she's using you to accumulate money because she might be breaking up with her husband soon. If he has access to all the bills and she doesn't, why would you be paying her to begin with? She's absolutely using you! I'm glad you talked to your stepdad", "NTA. I\u2019ve moved back in with my mom while I was making more than her, we agreed on a rent price and stuck with it. There were times she wanted more for the month but we discussed it and came to agreements it wasn\u2019t just her word is law. It sounds like you have the means to move out so I definitely encourage you to do so, that sounds toxic and uncomfortable to deal with especially with their crumbling relationship on top of it. And to tell you that it\u2019s fine if your wife and kids stay really just shows she\u2019s trying to target you and attack you in whatever way she can. People say horrible things when they\u2019re upset, it\u2019s in no way an excuse. I hope her actions and words are something you both can recover from. Also EVERYONE should feel open about discussing their wages openly it\u2019s weird we feel like we have to hide that stuff.", "NTA, move out with your family and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA\n\nSeems like the whole situation is a mess with all the bickering and arguing and disagreeing between everyone.  Your mom seems like a know-it-all control freak.\n\nSince it sounds like you can afford it, I would just get the hell out of there and find your own place.", "NTA. And I'd be out of there! Your step-dad is a good guy for being willing to decrease your rent. Your mom is using you for money since she's not working. Then her reaction and calling you those names were completely uncalled for. Guess who she is going to be calling if her and your SD divorce and she needs someone else to finance her life? YOU. I'd leave and block her a\\*\\*. Mom or not.", "NTA. She just wants control and clearly has some stuff she needs to work through. But this is on the edge of an E S H for me, because you need to get out of there, and you need to get your wife and kids out of that environment, as your kids in particular don\u2019t need to be exposed to that kind of toxic thinking. So yeah, not an AH now, but you will be one if you and your family stay.", "Sounds like you are a tenant.  With tennant rights.", "ESH \n\nYour family is a mess.\n\n\nYou're 3 people. You have a wife (does she work/did she before the baby?) and a baby. Get your family out of there, and move into your own space with a lease or a mortgage or whatever, with your name on the utility bills.\n\n\n$600, including utilities, is nothing for 3 people to live. $300 is half that. But there's a mess between your mom and step dad. Who owns the house? Is there a mortgage...in whose name? Who is the father of your brothers in terms of financial responsibility? \n\n\nGet your wife and baby out of there.", "YTA.  Not only did you know your mom is a deeply flawed woman, but you also knew she was enduring a divorce.  Then you made a move to keep her out of the household finances by dealing directly with your soon to be ex-SF.\n\nIOW, you deliberately put your wife and children in a toxic environment AND you have added to your mom's misery when she was already extremely vulnerable.\n\nGet your family into a rental.  Work 2 jobs or have your wife work to save the money you need for a house, is my advice.  Like this week.\n\nThen let mom cool off and talk to her.  Apologize for your part in this debacle, which in my view is the majority share.  Help her find a therapist, a lawyer, a new job or just a quick coffee break that doesn't exacerbate her fears.  Or if you can't handle any of that, at least leave her be until things cool off.\n\nYour mom should not have said what she did, but you are a grown man.  A husband and father.  Your duty to your children and wife should have dictated you do not expose them to their grandmother at her worst.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Glad to see that. Her behavior is outrageous. She's in no place to be around a child right now. You might even look into if she's capable of taking care of your brothers.   \n\n\nI'm sorry this money saving opportunity isn't going to work out for you.
