Although, I will say that it sounds as if no one really knows what the children are into.  \n\nGifts don't have to be expensive, they are more for to show care and that you want to bring another person joy.  In all honesty, if the dollar tree or 99 cent store has things the kids would rather have, then by all means get them something that they will actually feel as if they were heard.  Listening to the children is always way more important than buying fancy things.", "NTA Donate to a charity in the kids name.  It's an experience they haven't had yet.\nI love getting presents for my nibblings,,  but then they are polite and appreciative.  Rude and entitled kids would get boring socks from me.", "Nta. My brother's step kids did this with the gifts we got them for the first Christmas with us. We were not sure what to get them as we hadn't met them yet but we did have my brothers and now sils permission to get them $45 gift cards to their favorite store. They both looks at itand said, \"that's it?\"\n\nKeep in mind I have 4 other siblings that also sent them gift cards of different amounts. They have always just tossed what we gave them aside and got back on their electronics withouta second glance.

She chose a wildlife one and the kids would get a thank you card from said charity.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe someone who is really ungrateful anything.", "YTA for turning gift-giving for kids into the opportunity to make some kind of statement. Like, I don't know how to solve your relationship and general, and I can't tell you what you should or not give. \n\nIt's probably actually a positive sign their parents have basically asked you not to give them stuff that just clutters up the place and they don't use much.", "Hot lemonade actually slaps so hard and no one appreciates it", "Best comment!", "My kids would love these gifts from their aunts & uncles.", "I wish I could upvote this a thousand times", "Haha, I read it as \u201cmanatee and popcorn\u201d too!

That's an experience!!", "Nta", "It is sad that these children have not been taught gratitude by their parents. One year my young grandson got (what everyone thought would be the perfect gift for him) three identical gifts. Unfortunately, his parents bought it for him before Christmas and before the three relatives gave it to him. He had a horrible allergic reaction to it, so as he opened the gifts, his mom had to take it from him. \n\nThis young child was in a situation where all the other kids had four gifts, he only had one, since three were confiscated. He thanked everyone even for the gifts that he couldn\u2019t keep. He was just happy to be with the family-showed no disappointment or sullenness. \n\nHis parents have taught him values.

I know for a fact that people have gotten a call back for a job because they wrote a thank you note for an interview.  It may be old-fashioned now(as this was awhile ago), but it shows class, responsibility, acknowledgement, situational awareness.  \n\nPS take some other redditor advice to ungrateful relatives.  Don't buy coloring books and candy.  Instead, buy Kazoos, tambourines, or triangles.  Playdough, glitter and finger paint.  Things that are loud and things that are messy.

It's possible they are too young for you to be spending \"real money\" on them. My oldest niece is 6, my two nephews are 3. Last year was the first time I spent any significant money on my niece, and she loved it, but I don't think she really appreciated the cost (it was a tea set that came in a case that had her name on it, was about $75). I can spend $20 on a couple matchbox cars and some sidewalk chalk and the boys will appreciate it just as much as if I gave them the supposed number one thing on their list.", "NTA they sounds like my niece and nephew they do not appreciate anything you do for them", "NTA  though dollar tree gifts might be a tiny bit of an over correct.
