Be honest how often do your boys speak to your mother without being prompted... How often do you call or visit for that matter....It sounds like you feel jealous...here is another way to look at it...You could choose to be grateful that your mother has someone and that you don't have to feel guilty or worried because she has people with her who care about her.\n\nYou feel your mother should have put your first..you mother may have not wanted Lily to feel that the minute you turned up she was no longer important or needed.\n\nAnd you kind of proved your mother right..the minute it didn't go your way you packed up and drove 8 hours home taking her grandsons with you. Guess who probably has made your broken hearted mother a cup of tea and is actually being there keeping her company through her upset....\n\nI think you need to think about why you are upset and what you want and what you want would mean to/for your mother...and your mother needs to learn some tact maybe.

It was on me to come to her or no visit, not that she was ever happy to see me anyway. For context we lived in the prairies in Canada; the drive is no better or worse in either direction. It's just flat and straight, boring both ways. I eventually gave up, stopped calling or visiting and she apparently had no issue with that.

Could you have made the trip with your mom, or did work and life not allow you the chance? I'm guessing you probably wouldn't have been able to do that with her. So, would you rather that she couldn't go at all? Or can you be glad that she had this opportunity to take this enjoyable trip with another companion? Another way of looking at it is how about yourself when you are older? Do you want to be able to spend your money as your wish, our do you want your children to guilt you over how you spend it? It is her money, and she's earned it. She can take great trips to Europe and bring someone along if she wants to. If she hadn't gone on this trip, she wouldn't have necessarily given more graduation money to others, and $300 is a very generous graduation gift. So, do I understand why your feelings were hurt? Absolutely, and she should, too. You drove many hours to see you and as her child, she could have made you feel prioritized. But feeling resentful and angry in general about the fact that she has someone nearby that she gets friendship and support from... I think you might be better off in the long run if you try to be a bit more understanding about that.

They were much closer to my cousins who lived near them, which sometimes showed in monetary ways and I was never bother by that because I was never taught I was entitled to what they had and it just seemed logical to me.\n\nFamily by choice is still family. You are caught on this thing about her wanting a girl, and I believe that is real and is a trauma you hold deep. But she isn't close to Lily *now* because Lily is a girl. She's close because Lily spends time with her, helps her, is there for her every day, because they have a bond that quite frankly your kids cannot have when you have kept your mother at arm's reach. \n\nFamily by choice is family. Your mom is incredibly generous to make college accounts for her grandkids, she'd be well within her rights to not. But she has, she's made college accounts, and made those for her biological grandkids much larger.\n\nHow often do your kids call her? Take an interest in her and her life? Off their own back? At least one is old enough he has had plenty of time to make his own relationship with her.\n\nThe parking spot is Lily's, because Lily parks there every single day. You regressed to childhood because you are still holding onto all that trauma, but you need to get some therapy and learn to respond like an adult, stop being so entitled, and take a step back.\n\nHonestly, until I saw this comment I could accept this was NTA or ESH, but come on. Really?", "Thanks - sons didn\u2019t belong in that sentence.", "Really like your metaphor there, very visual and clear to the point of what this entire post is about", "She is paying for there college", "Sounds like OP has his own money and the neighbour is not as fortunate.", "Maybe her own sons were just not interested in her culture and language and she has more in common with Lily - hence the Europe trip? Different treatment is not always based on malevolence; some parent-child pairings just \u201cclick\u201d more than others.", "She gave her *actual* grandchildren $300 but took the neighbor's child to Europe for 2 months. We have plenty of information.", "Presumably she's in her late 50s at a minimum. I wouldn't expect any significant changes in character at this point in her life...", "[removed]", "Yup to all you said. \n\nAlso mom probably had an empty nest by the time Lily came around. Her boys are all grown and have left the house. She\u2019s probably retired/semi retired by then and have a lot of time on her hands to look after Lily. Lily and her mom probably treats the mom really well and have become family. And they\u2019re right next door when OP and his brothers live pretty far away. They probably look out for the mom as much as the mom looks out for them. It\u2019s a relationship 16 years in the making while OP and his brothers are away living their own lives. \n\nI get the feeling that the parking is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back as the feeling of resentment built up towards someone who takes up a lot of mom\u2019s money and time. Moving the car because it\u2019s parked in Lily\u2019s spot isn\u2019t such a big deal, imo. It makes sense since it is Lily\u2019s spot and has probably been since she could drive. Also she\u2019s a girl so I\u2019d give her prime spot too. In my house we have an unspoken rule that girls\u2019 cars are closest to the door, boys\u2019 cars are further away. Girls tends to wear heels, carry more things so it makes sense for their car to be closer. We have the same kind of unspoken rule when we go to our mom\u2019s house. People with babies/young kids get the closest to the door spot, then girls then guys. None of us ever realised it was even a rule until a friend pointed it out. I guess in our collective minds it all just makes sense. \n\nBack to the OP I do think OP is YTA for leaving in a huff without a conversation. But also I don\u2019t see what a conversation can do as I don\u2019t think that OP is entirely reasonable. My mom loves my daughter, even though she is the most difficult grandchild, because my daughter loves hanging out with my mom. Whenever my mom wants to go away for a holiday she\u2019ll always invite my daughter to go with her. They go on trips together fairly often. My other nieces and nephews aren\u2019t really jealous because they don\u2019t like hanging out with my mom quite as much as my daughter does. If my mom goes out to eat, she\u2019ll always ask my nephew to go with her. He is a proper foodie and she loves going out to restaurants with him. On my in law\u2019s side, my kids never get money for visiting, but my nieces get money from them on a regular basis (since January to October my nieces have gotten $4000 each). Their parents are divorced and my in laws started giving them money to cheer them up since it happened. It\u2019s been 10 years and they\u2019ve never stopped giving them money. My kids aren\u2019t jealous at all and they all still go visit their grandparents weekly and just spend time with them because apart from the money, the grandparents treat them all the same. My MIL will cook all the grandchildren\u2019s favourite dishes each week, asks about their week, chats with all of them. My in laws love having all the kids over and if mine can\u2019t make it they\u2019ll be really bummed and will make it a priority to see them on a different day. \n\nThere is more to family dynamics than just gotta treat everyone the same no matter what. Some needs more, some needs less, some makes better travel companions, some makes better eating companion. Some they actually enjoy spending time with because the feeling is mutual. \n\nIf I lived hundred of miles away, and my mom was taken cared of by a wonderful neighbour who makes my mom happy, I\u2019d be eternally grateful and I would not resent the relationship my mom would have with that person. That person is helping me live the life that I chose without having to worry about my mother potentially being alone and lonely.", "What a weird assumption", "There's \"family of origin\" and there's \"family of choice\".", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bjd41e/aita_for_throwing_away_my_boyfriends_potentially/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Of course, the treatment is going to be different. The girl is only 18, and OP is in their 50s with their own life and kids 8 hours away. Lily has been there to not only help her daily but also has helped fill the empty nest.

It's a sad, but true reality.", "She's not doing well by them, for sure.", "I agree.  She can make the effort to come see him if she really cares", "It's part of why I like this sub so much, how almost identical situations can result in a completely different consensus. It's fascinating, but it's weird too. People seem to fill in between the lines to fit the narrative they want.", "She knows Lily so well, because she is a girl and she always wanted a daughter.\n\nShe could have taken her two grandsons *and* Lily on a 4 week vacation, she chose to ignore her grandsons.", "My parents made me learn their native language growing up, if they didnt i would only speak english. That argument definitely doesnt stand. What makes it that son wasnt visiting? Why isnt it \u201cthe Mom wasnt visiting the son?\u201d Seems like she has more time to visit her son, considering free time to babysit and travel. It seems that OP made the time to be present for his mom despite her not being present in sons life, and acted accordingly when asked to move", "Isn\u2019t it OP\u2019s time and choice then who to spend time with?  How could he be TA with that logic??", "Ya I was thinking since the mom doesn\u2019t see the grandsons a lot it\u2019s obvious why she\u2019s closer to Lily. \nI think you\u2019re right about there being a lot more that contributes to his resentment. It\u2019s definitely not about a parking space.", "Actually, I don't see that.  In any case, the money represents investment in wanting the children to have as much opportunity as possible.  If it were just that the neighbor is not as fortunate, his mother could have mentioned the 8 week trip and suggested that the grandsons could come too.  Then had a discussion about the costs involved.  She chose to take Lily for a one-one trip that was more than she has spent with any of her grandsons in the past decade and she did it because she wanted more for Lily than she's ever wanted for her grandsons.", "Look, there's clearly favouritism here (though I gotta say, I personally was never bothered by the fact my grandparents favoured my cousins who actually lived in the same area as them and saw them regularly, that seemed normal) but Lily isn't \"neighbour's child\". She is a grandchild by choice and that is absolutely and completely valid, and legitimate, even if it's not a blood or legal relationship. You don't need to minimise it, because there's plenty here without doing that.", "The information we are missing is whether he talked with his mother about this. The blatant favourtism is known", "Some of us just don't see any value in ultimatums anyway. His mom is being who she chooses to be. Asking her to pick when she clearly has already made choices seems melodramatic *and* a waste of time to me?", "This is the truth", "Treat everyone equally, or NC.", "Yup. It needs to be repeated that he was told to move for the person who lives ACROSS THE STREET.", "Except it's absolutely ludicrous that the mom didn't go 'hey my son is going to be here, can he park there'. The fact that she didn't is just more evidence of the misbalanced relationship.", "Right? $300 is way more than most people get for graduation. Rich people problems.", "She may have regretted not teaching her MUCH OLDER sons and decided to teach Lily because of that. She can\u2019t teach her grandson readily\u2014he lives 8 hours away.", "It\u2019s sorta fascinating how people latch on to a narrative that maybe has nothing to do with the original post, and it gets picked up by the mob and just runs away.", "Do you think these teenage boys want to spend 8 weeks with an elderly woman they barely know? Because it wasn't sending her on her way, it was a trip they took together. The entitlement blows my mind, it's her money, why should she not treat someone she cares for who is actively in her life and wants to spend time with her to this trip? It may be she doesn't want to travel alone, by having Lily on the trip with her she is able to feel comfortable travelling such a long time in a way she otherwise wouldn't be.

Leave her to it.", "Do you think the blatant favoritism is going to magically disappear when he tells his mom it's hurtful? Or is she suddenly going to realize she's doing it and stop?
