Be honest how often do your boys speak to your mother without being prompted... How often do you call or visit for that matter....It sounds like you feel jealous...here is another way to look at it...You could choose to be grateful that your mother has someone and that you don't have to feel guilty or worried because she has people with her who care about her.\n\nYou feel your mother should have put your first..you mother may have not wanted Lily to feel that the minute you turned up she was no longer important or needed.\n\nAnd you kind of proved your mother right..the minute it didn't go your way you packed up and drove 8 hours home taking her grandsons with you. Guess who probably has made your broken hearted mother a cup of tea and is actually being there keeping her company through her upset....\n\nI think you need to think about why you are upset and what you want and what you want would mean to/for your mother...and your mother needs to learn some tact maybe.

With her mom across the street or with yours? If she lives with her mom, why she couldn't just park at her mom's place? Why ask you to move your car when her mom lives so close by? And if she was just visiting for thanksgiving, why make you, who drove for 8 hours, move your car so she can park in the driveway?

She wanted daughters and when this single woman moved in next door she jumped at the opportunity to have one. The fact that she helped pay for \u201cLily\u2019s\u201d private school because she didn\u2019t like the free local ones, takes her one very long expensive holidays, and now refuses to allow her son to park on her drive, just shows how much she cares for her biological children and grandchildren. She doesn\u2019t care for them, so should be happy that they left.", "NTA\n\nHave you heard of winning the battle but losing the war? That\u2019s sort of what happened here.\n\nIt\u2019s your mom\u2019s house and you are guests there. Perhaps there are practical reasons why Lily parks in the driveway. Regardless, as the guest, parking in the street versus the driveway is a trivial thing to get bent out of shape over. If this were only about moving the car, I\u2019d roll my eyes and move the car.\n\nHowever, your feelings of being less loved are completely justified. This event regarding who parks in the driveway may not be the best example, but I bet you can think up ten more events that show how your mom neglects you and supports Lily. Why would you and your sons want to spend time with your mom? That\u2019s why I agree with you leaving but want to clarify you didn\u2019t leave because of the driveway incident, you left because why bother tolerating even more emotional neglect after already having experienced a lifetime of it. Good on you for taking back your time. Spend that time and energy in the company of people who do appreciate you and your sons.", "NTA. Of course it was ridiculous to ask you to move your car. Your mum is obviously playing favourites. I will ask however how come you never had the curiosity to get to know either of your parents' cultures? Did they keep it away from you?", "NTA I don't understand why so many people are saying Y T A. OP's mum wanted a daughter and the minute an available one came into her life she took her. From what it sounds like OPs mum prioritised Lily for 16 years over her own children and grandchildren. No wonder they only see each other a few times a year. Why would you want to spend time with a parent who blatantly favours their neighbours child over you? This isn't about a parking space it's about the fact that OPs mum constantly puts the adoptive daughter above her sons.

Do we really believe if OP had come home and said Mummy can you speak to me in Italian she would have said no.", "Again I am not a bro I am certainly not your bro...My mother is dead she died tragically at 51 I would love to be able to talk to her but I can't, and 20 years later I still miss her.... when she was alive I spoke to her nearly every day... and I do talk to my father regularly and have him to stay for months at a time. Sometime you need to think before you are flippant.", "No wish I could speak 3 languages", ">level 2aitaneighborscar Op \u00b7   \n>  \n>38 min. agoWe see her once or twice a year.

And answer the question which one are you closer to....", "They're fighting for their live in these comments. I'm refreshing just to watch them go off lol", "Right??!! Did you see the multiple paragraph comment where she sad \u201cnonnie\u201d? Why would anyone randomly assume that Lily calls OP\u2019s mom nonnie?? That sealed it for me!", "So much this. What was the mom supposed to do when OP left and got his own family and raised his kids 16 years ago? She just befriended her neighbours and became close to them and now they have a certain kind of relationship and routine. I live away from my parents too (in another country) and my parents have become close to their friend\u2019s/neighbour\u2019s kid. I went back home last month and the day i landed my parents were at the neighbour\u2019s kid\u2019s wedding function because they were a huge part of it. \n\nDid I throw a tantrum or make a big deal out of it? No, I went home, had a hot shower, ate some delicious food from the fridge and went to sleep. Then the next day I put on a sari and went for the main wedding event.\n\nOP needs to get over himself. Parents shouldn\u2019t be expected to just be frozen in time, waiting endlessly for their children and to drop everything for them.", "The first sentence clearly states that the mother wanted daughters and did not get them. She then proceded to raise two sons into adulthood who somehow endep up with no knowledge or connections to the culture of their ancestors. Yet when OP's mother gets the chance to raise a girl, that child does end up with strong connectios to the customs, language and culture. If it wasn't deliberate it is one hell of a coincidence.", "Nothing stopping the mom from visiting OP and his family too. If she's able to take the neighbour's daughter on an 8 week holiday across Europe she's able to visit her actual family 8 hours away. It's obvious from OPs post there's years of examples of the mother favouring the neighbours. Paying for Lily's private education and gifting her such an expensive graduation gift must be particularly hurtful to her actual grandsons who are of the same age. \n\nI can completely understand OP's perspective that it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I would distance myself from that too. As someone else in this thread said it's a coping mechanism for dealing with emotionally detached parents.", "We see this differently. \n\nI\u2019m inferring this from a long-term history. OP states their mom always wanted a daughter. Since she only has sons (and later grandsons), she became enamored with Lily. \n\nI took the tone of OP\u2019s post to state that his mom became so involved with Lily that she placed her first and foremost. \n\nI don\u2019t totally know if the OP or his brother wanted to learn French or Italian. But since he mentioned it, I inferred that he may have wanted the same attention/opportunity to learn it as Lily. \n\nIf OP\u2019s mom or dad has never talked to him or his brother, and the grandsons about taking them to Europe but they took Lily, I\u2019d be very hurt. Maybe they have gone, this is also a possibility. \n\nIf I\u2019d driven 8 hours only to be told that I needed to move my car because it was someone else\u2019s designated spot, that would be so disrespectful to me. I drove a third of the day to see you, and you tell me to move for her, when she could park in the street? Nope. \n\nSounds to me like the car incident was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.", "There are varying degrees of shit. If u wanna pass over family history and traditions for a random neighbor then ya. I think thats shitty. Ur right tho as far as shit goes this is tame compared to most stories here.", "This is about a woman who cannot properly cope with the fact that she was never gifted a daughter and never properly gave love to her sons. OP has a right to be upset , and has a right to push his mother away because of her actions . His mother never made an effort to teach him her language and OP lives 8 hours away with his own family.", "What's her excuse for not being ther for the two children she quite literally RAISED TO ADULTHOOD. Did they also live 8 hours away from their mother in their childhood? \n\nThe grandchildren are a separate but related issue. I agree that the disparity in closeness can be somewhat explained by distance and frequency of contact. \n\nShe gets no such grace regarding her two sons however. OP and his brother were raised by a woman that made evident that she wanted girls and thus they weren't what she wanted. They could live in the same hose as this woman and that fact would remain unchanged.", "Reread the post. Lily is 18 and is the daughter of the neighbour who moved in 16 years ago so OP's mom met Lily when she was 2.", "Keep justifying the mom's bad parental decisions and abdication of teaching her actual sons her culture just because they weren't born as girls.", "Dude I have heard 5 year olds that speak english as a first language and I would hardly call them fluent. Get a grip", "Were any of those languages the native tongue of your parents? We're not talking about the fact that Lily speaks more languages, we're talking about the fact that somehow both of the children this woman raised have NO connection to their roots. If the Mother had fostered the language and culture it would've stuck, there are millions of immigrant families that prove that.", "You don't need to force children you raised since birth to learn a language, you just need to talk to them in that language. If children are brought up with it, they will speak it. There are millions of immigrant families all over the world that prove this.", "A very specific hypothetical with a personal anecdote to make it seem valid", "Anecdotally, I have never seen an Italian language class in a public or private high school near me (actually 5 high schools that I know don't offer Italian, but some of them do offer Latin). As for French, only 3 of the 5 of the high schools offer French (and these are schools that do offer 3 foreign languages).", "Legit though. I\u2019m Canadien, we have English and French. When I was in high-school, we had Spanish. But that was it. I don\u2019t even know what they have here now. So, do American high schools teach other languages?", "Oh noooooo, still don't care still has nothing to do with post. Just cause you can't move on doesnt mean this dude needs to put up with a shit mom", "They're so invested for someone who isn't involved in the story lmao", "They are grown ups with grown children who live 8 hours away..and if we look at the sentence \"Lily and her family usually helps her out with everyday stuff.\" maybe she can't be there anymore, maybe she is the one who needs looking after now. \n\nAnd lots of people had parents who wished they had had a son or a daughter. We don't know why his mother stopped at 2 children. Wishing you could have had a child of another gender doesn't mean you don't love your children you have. Admittedly there are cases like that but there are so many more where people would have loved to have had...My MIL always wanted a girl..doesn't mean she doesn't adore her sons she just would have liked a girl as well.", "[deleted]", "Depends on the high school and state. French/Spanish were the most common in my state growing up from middle to high school but other states' did offer other courses like German/Chinese/etc.", "OP's mother isn't your MIL. The facts we have are that a woman who wanted daughters never had one. Then the two male children she gave birth to and raised to adulthood somehow grew up with no connection to their roots, to the customs, the culture and the languages of their parents and ancestors. Yet   when she has the opportunity to raise a girl that child does end up with every single one of those things. A truly wild coincidence, that is more likely explaind by intentional action.\n\nThat might well be the reason they live so far away from their mother. But at the end of the day it doesn't matter because it is quantifiably obvious  who she cares for more.", "And even then they would retain some grasp of it. becaused it's how they were RAISED. This woman was uninterested in passing down her culture to her children for no other reason than their gender.", "We don't know that. We have a story told by a man who with any sort of generosity just threw his toys out the pram..(for whatever reason justified or not) telling his side of the story. Not everyone is interested in their culture some children just want to fit in. And that is the point she raised that girl and that girl is in her life day to day...that girl is present..for whatever reason her son and his sons are not. And yes she took Lily to Europe...she didn't send Lily to Europe. Lily a late teenage girl went traveling with a woman old enough to be her grandmother around Europe for 8 week..can't imagine there was a lot of partying going on...most teens would not want to do that. It speaks to the depth of their relationship. The fact they are not blood related shouldn't matter."]}
